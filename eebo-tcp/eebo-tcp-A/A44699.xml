         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SInce it is the lot of the following
Pages to be exposed to publike
view; There is somewhat of
justice in it, to your selves, or
me, that the world do also know wherein
divers of you have contributed thereto,
that, if any thing redound hence to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
advantage, it may be understood to
be owing in part to you: or, if it shall
be reckon'd an useless trouble, in
this way to represent things, so obvious
to common notice, and whereof so much
is already said; all the blame of the

not belong) to me only.</p>
            <p>But I must here crave your excuse,
that, on this account, I give you a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
of what (for the most part)
you already know, and may possibly

it is now become convenient that

may be attended with a fruit which
may be same recompence for their want

death gave the occasion of the ensuing
Meditations) had, from his youth, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
between Twenty and Thirty years
of his age in <hi>Spain,</hi> your joint-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
had at length obtained from
him a promise of returning: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.
when you were in somewhat a near
expectation, a sudden disease in so few
days landed him in another world, that
the first notice you had of his death, or
<pb facs="tcp:48026:3"/>
sickness, was by the arrival of that Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
(clad in mourning-attire) which,
according to his own desire in his sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
brought over the deserted body to
its native place of <hi>Lupton;</hi> that
thence it might find a Grave where
it first received a Soul; and obtain a
Mansion in the Earth, where first it
became one to a reasonable spirit.</p>
            <p>A little before this time, the desire
of an interview among your selves
(which the distance of your habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
permitted not to be frequent) had
induced divers of you to appoint a
meeting at some middle place, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the trouble of a long journey
might be conveniently shared among
you.</p>
            <p>But, before that agreed resolution
could have its accomplishment, this sad
and most unexpected Event intervening,
altered the place, the occasion, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of your meeting; but effected the
thing it self, and brought together
no less than Twenty, the Brothers
and Sisters of the deceased, or their
Consorts; besides his many Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phews
and Neices, and other Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to the mournful solemnity of the
<pb facs="tcp:48026:4"/>
Interment. Within the time of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
together upon this sad account, this
passage of the <hi>Psalmist</hi> here insisted
on, came into discourse among us; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
introduced by an occasion which
(though then, it may be, unknown to
the most of you) was somewhat
rare, and not unworthy observation;
<hi>viz.</hi> That one of your selves, having
been sometime before surprised with an
unusual sadness, joined with an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of ill tidings, upon no known
cause, had so urgent an inculcation of
these words, as not to be able to forbear
the revolving them, much of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
part of that day, in the latter part
whereof the first notice was brought to
that place of this so near a Relations
decease.</p>
            <p>Certain Months after, some of you
with whom I was then conversant in
<hi>London,</hi> importuned me to have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
from me in writing upon that
Subject. Whereto I at length agreed,
with a cautionary request, That it
might not come into many bands, but
might remain (as the occasion was)
among your selves. Nor will I deny it
to have been some inducement to me
<pb facs="tcp:48026:4"/>
to apply my thoughts to that Theam,
that it had been so suggested as was
said. For such presages and abodings,
as that above-mentioned, may reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
be thought to owe themselves to
some more steady and universal prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,
than Casualty, or the party's
own Imagination: By whose more
noble recommendation (that such a
gloomy Premonition might carry with
it not what should only afflict, but
also instruct and teach) this Subject
did seem offered to our meditation.</p>
            <p>Accordingly therefore, after my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to the place of my abode, I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily
drew up the substance of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Discourse; which, a year ago,
I transmitted into their hands who
desired it from me, without reserving
to my self any Copy. Hereby it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
difficult to me, presently to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
(besides divers considerations I
might have against the thing it self)
with that joint request of some of
you (in a Letter, which my removal
into another Kingdom occasioned to
come long after to my hands) that I
would consent these Papers might be
made publike. For as I have reason to
<pb facs="tcp:48026:5"/>
be conscious to my self of disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
enough to discourage any under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
of that kind: so I am more
especially sensible, that so curs<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry and
superficial a management of a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
so very important, (though its
private occasion and design at first,
might render it excusable to those few
friends for whom it was meant) can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be liable to the hard censure
(not to say the contempt) of many
whom Discourses of this kind should
more desgnedly serve. And therefore,
though my willingness to be servicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
in keeping alive the apprehension
and expectation of another state, my
value of your judgments who conceive
what is here done may be useful
thereto; and my peculiar respects to
your selves, the members and appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
of a Family to which (besides
some relation) I have many obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and endearments; do prevail
with me not wholly to deny: Yet par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
me that I have suspended my
consent to this publication, till I
should have a Copy transmitted to me
from some of you, for my necessary
review of so hasty a production, that I
<pb facs="tcp:48026:5"/>
might not offer to the view of the
world, what, after I had penn'd it had
scarce passed my own. And now, after
so long an expectation, those Papers
are but this last week come to my
hands: I here return them, with little
or no alteration; s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

that such into whose hands this little
Treatise shall fall, may be induced to
consider the true end of their beings;
to examine and discuss the matter
more throughly with themselves, what
it may or can be supposed such a sort
of Creatures was made and placed on
this Earth for: That when they shall
have reasoned themselves into a setled
apprehension of the worthy and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
Ends they are capable of attaining,
and are visibly designed to, They may be
seized with a noble disdain of living be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath
themselves, and the bounty of
their Creator.</p>
            <p>It is obvious to common observation,
how flagrant and intense a zeal, men
are often wont to express for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal
reputation, the honour of their
Families, yea or for the glory of their
Nation; but how few are acted by that
more laudable and enlarged zeal for the
dignity of Mankind?</p>
            <p>How few are they that resent the
common and vile depression of their
own species! Or that, while in things
of lightest consideration they strive with
emulous endeavour, that they and
<pb facs="tcp:48026:6"/>
their relatives may excel other men, do
reckon it a reproach if in matters of
the greatest consequence they and all
men should not excel Beasts! How few
that are not contented to confine their
utmost designs and expectations within
the same narrow limits! Through a
mean and inglorious self-despiciency,
confessing in themselves (to the Truth's
and their own wrong) an incapacity
of greater things! and, with most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious
falshood, proclaiming the same
of all Mankind besides!</p>
            <p>If he that, amidst the hazards of a
dubious Warr, betrays the Interest and
Honour of his Countrey, be justly infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous,
and thought worthy severest
punishments; I see not why a debaucht
Sensualist, that lives as if he were
created only to indulge his appetite,
that so vilifies the notion of man, as if
he were made but to eat, and drink,
and sport; to please only his sense
and sancy; that in this time and
state of conflict between the powers of
this present world, and those of the
world to come, quits his Party, bids
open defiance to Humanity, abjures the
Noble Principles and Ends, forsakes
<pb facs="tcp:48026:7"/>
the Laws and Society of all that are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
to be esteemed men; abandons the
common and rational hope of mankind
concerning a future immortality, and
herds himself among brute Creatures;

a great presumption to seem to dissent
from the prophane infidel Crew. As
if the matter were already formally
determined in the behalf of Irreligion,
and the Doctrine of the life to come
had been clearly condemned in open
Council, as a detestable Heresie. For
what Tenet was ever more exploded
and hooted at, than that practice is
which alone agrees with this? Or what
series or course of repeated Villanies
can ever be more ignominious than
(in vulgar estimate) a course of life
so transacted as doth become the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation
of a blessed immortality? And
what? After so much written and
spoken by persons of all times and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious
for the immortality of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Soul, and so common an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment
thereof by <hi>Pagans, Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans,
Jews,</hi> and <hi>Christians;</hi> Is
man now at last condemn'd and doom'd
to a perpetual death, as it were, by
the consent and suffrage even of men?
and that too without trial or hearing?
and not by the reason of men, but their
lusts only? As if (with a loud and
violent cry) they would assassinate
and stifle this belief and hope, but not
<pb facs="tcp:48026:8"/>
judg it? And shall the matter be thus
given up as hopeless? and the victory
be yeilded to prosperous wickedness, and
a too succesful conspiracy of vile Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creants
against both their Maker, and
their own Stock and Race?</p>
            <p>One would think whosoever have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in them any conscience of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation
and duty to the common Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and Author of our Beings, any
remembrance of our Divine Original,
any breathings of our ancient hope,
any sense of humane honour, any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentments
of so vile an indignity to
the nature of man, any spark of a
just and generous indignation for so
opprobrious a contumely to their own
Kind and Order in the Creation, should
oppose themselves with an Heroick vigour
to this treacherous and unnatural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination.</p>
            <p>And let us (my worthy Friends) he
provoked, in our several capacities to do
our parts herein; and, at least, so to
live, and converse in this world, that
the course and tenour of our lives may
import an open asserting of our hopes in
another; and may let men see we are
not ashamed to own the belief of a life
<pb facs="tcp:48026:8"/>
to come: Let us by a patient continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in well-doing (how low designs
soever others content themselves to
pursue) seek honour, glory, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
to our selves; and, by our
avowed, warrantable ambition in this
pursuit, justifie our great and bountiful
Creator, who hath made us not in vain,
but for so high and great things: And
glorifie our blessed Redeemer, who
amidst the gloomy and disconsolate
darkness of this wretched world, when
it was overspred with the shadow of
death, hath brought life and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
to light in the Gospel. Let us la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
both to seel and express the power
of that Religion, which hath the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choation
of the (participated) divine
life, for its principle; and the perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
and eternal perpetuation thereof,
for its scope and end.</p>
            <p>Nor let the time that hath since
elapsed, be found to have worn out
with you the (useful) impressions which
this monitory surprising instance of our
Mortality did at first make: But give
me leave to inculcate from it what was
said to you when the occasion was fresh
and new: That we labour more deeply
<pb facs="tcp:48026:9"/>
to apprehend Gods dominion over his
Creatures; And that he made us prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
for himself, and for ends that
are to be compast in the future state; not
for the temporary satisfaction and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of one another in this world.</p>
            <p>Otherwise, Providence had never been
guilty of such a Solecism, to take out
one from a Family long famous for so
exemplary mutual love, and dispose him
into so remote a part; not permitting to
most of his nearest Relations the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of him for almost thirty years (and
therein all the flower) of his age; and
at last, when you were expecting the
man, send you home the breathless
frame wherein he lived.</p>
            <p>Yet it was not contemptible that you
had that. And that dying (as <hi>Joseph</hi>)
in a strange Land, he gave, also, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
concerning his bones; that
though, in his life, he was (mostly) se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from his brethren, he might
in death be gathered to his fathers.</p>
            <p>It was some evidence (though you
wanted not better) that amidst the
Traffick of <hi>Spain,</hi> he more esteemed the
Religion of <hi>England;</hi> and therefore,
would rather his dust should ass<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ciate
<pb facs="tcp:48026:9"/>
with theirs, with whom also he would
rather his spirit should.</p>
            <p>But whatever it did evidence, it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion'd
so much, that you had that
so general meeting with one another,
which otherwise, probably, you would
not have had, nor are likely again to
have (so hath Providence scattered
you) in this world. And that it
proved a more serious meeting than
otherwise it might: for, however it
might blamelesly have been designed to
have met together at a cheerful Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
God saw it sitter to order the
meeting at a mournful grave; and to
make the House that received you,
(the native place to many of you)
the House of mourning rather than of
feasting. The one would have had more
quick relishes of a present pleasure;
but the other was likely to yeild the
more lasting sense of an after-profit.
Nor was it an ill errand to come toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
(though from afar, for divers of
you) to learn to dye. As you might,
by being so sensibly put in mind of it,
though you did not see that very part
acted it self.</p>

               </gap>tulation with God

to the consideration of my short
time that of dying-mankind, and
behold a dark and deadly shade
universally overspreading the
World, the whole species of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48026:12"/>
Creatures vanishing, quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the stage round about me,
and disappearing almost as soon as
they shew themselves: Have I not
a fair and plausible ground for
that (seemingly rude) challenge?
Why is there so unaccountable a
<hi>Phoenomenon?</hi> Such a Creature made
to no purpose? The noblest part
of this inferior Creation brought
forth into being without any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable
design? I know not how
to unty the knot, upon this only
view of the case, or avoid the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdity.
'Tis hard sure to decline
the supposal (of what it may yet
seem hard to suppose) <hi>that all men
were made in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It appears the expostulation was
somewhat passionate; and did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
upon the sudden view of this
disconsolate case, very abstractly
considered, and by it self only; and
that he did not in that instant look
beyond it to a better and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
scene of things. An eye
bleered with present sorrow, sees
not so far, nor comprehends so
much at one view, as it would at
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48026:13"/>
another time; or as it doth, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently,
when the tear is wip't out,
and its own beams have cleard it
up.</p>
            <p>We see he did quickly look fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and had got a more light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
prospect, when in the next
words we find him contemplating
Gods <hi>sworn loving-kindness unto Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid.</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 49.</note>
The truth and stability where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
he at the same time expresly
acknowledges, while only the
form of his speech doth but seem
to import a doubt <hi>[where are
they?]</hi> But yet <hi>[they were sworn
in truth]</hi> Upon which argument
he had more copiously dilated in
the former part of the <hi>Psalm;</hi> and
it still lay deep in his soul, though
he were now a little diverted
from the present consideration
of it.</p>
            <p>Which, since it turns the scales
with him; It will be needful to
enquire into the weight and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of it. Nor have we any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
to think that <hi>David</hi> was either
so little a Prophet or a Saint, as
in his own thoughts to refer those
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48026:13"/>
magnificent things (the instances
of that loving-kindness confirm'd
by Oath, which he recites from
the 19 verse of the Psalm to the
38, as spoken from the mouth of
God, and declared to him by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,
to the dignity of his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
and the grandieur and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity
of his Kingdom. As if it
were ultimately meant of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,<note place="margin">V, 27.</note>
that <hi>God would make him his
first-born, higher than the Kings of
the earth,</hi> (when there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
greater Kings, and (in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
of the little spot over which
he reigned) a vastly spreading
Monarchy, that still overtopt him
all his time, as the same and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive
Monarchies did his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors)
or that it was intended of
the secular glory and stability of
his Throne and Family; that God
would make them <hi>to endure for ever,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 29.</note>
and <hi>be as the days of Heaven;</hi> that
they should be as <hi>the Sun before
him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 36, 37.</note> and <hi>be establisht for ever as the

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48026:14"/>
That God himself meant it not
so, experience and the event of
things hath shown; and that these
predictions cannot otherwise have
had their accomplishment, than
in the succession of the spiritual
and everlasting Kingdom of the
Messiah (whom God raised up
out of his loins to sit on his
throne) unto his temporal King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.<note place="margin">Act. 2. 30</note>
Wherein 'tis therefore end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by perfection, rather than cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
These Prophesies being
then made good, not formally, in
the kind which they literally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported;
but with an (highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dundant)
equivalency in another
(far more noble) kind. In which
sense God's Covenant with him
must be understood,<note place="margin">V. 28. 34.</note> which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists
on so much in this Psalm, even
unto that degree, as to challenge
God upon it, as if in the gloomy
dispensation of this juncture (so
far did it darken his present ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of things) he did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
vacate and make it void:<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Though he sufficiently express his
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48026:14"/>
confidence, both before and after,
that this could never be. But 'tis
plain it hath been vacated long
enough ago, in the subversion of
<hi>David</hi>'s Kingdom; and in that we
see his Throne and Family have
not been establisht for ever; have
not endured as the days of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;
if those words had no other
than their obvious and literal
meaning. And if any would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
a <hi>salvo</hi> to the truth of God,
from the wickedness of his poste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
first making a breach, and
disobliging him; it is expresly
precluded by what we find insert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in reference to this very case:
<hi>If his children forsake my law,</hi>

So that they that will make a scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to accuse the Holy God of
falshood in that which with so
much solemnity he hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and sworn, must not make any
to admit his further intendment
in these words. And that he had a
further (even a mystical and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual)
intendment in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
with <hi>David,</hi> is yet more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
evident from that of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet

&amp;c. What means this universal
invitation to all thirsty persons,
with the subjoined encouragement
of making with them an <hi>everlasting
Covenant</hi> (the same which we have
here, no doubt, as to the principal
parts, and which we find him men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
also, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 5. with cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
exactly corresponding to
these of the Prophet) <hi>even the sure

mercies of David?</hi> The meaning sure
could not be, that they should
be all Secular Kings and Princes,
and their posterity after them for
ever; which we see is the verbal
sound and tenor of this Covenant.</p>
            <p>And now since it is evident God
intended a mystery in this Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
we may be as well assured he
intended no deceit, and that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed
not a delusion to <hi>David</hi> by
the vision in which he gave it. Can
we think he went about to gratifie
him with a solemn fiction, and
draw him into a false and fanciful
faith; or so to hide his meaning
from him, as to tempt him into the
belief of what he never meant? And
to what purpose was this so special
Revelation <hi>by vision,</hi> if it were not
to be understood truly, at least, if not
yet perfectly and fully? It is left
us therefore to collect, that <hi>David</hi>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48026:16"/>
as Pen-man, that he was of another
temper than to place the sum and
chief of his expectations, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solations,
in his own and his posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
worldly greatness. And to put
us out of doubt,<note place="margin">Mat. 22.</note> our Saviour (who
well knew his Spirit) expresly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
tells us, that <hi>he in spirit called
him Lord;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 110.</note> 
               <hi>when he said, The Lord
said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my

understood God's revelation touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the future-concernments of his

thereto) <hi>viz.</hi> as a figure and

            <p>Nor was he in that ignorance a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
the nature and design of Christs
Kingdom, but that he understood
its reference to another world, and
state of things, even beyond all the
successions of time, and the mortal
race of men; so as to have his eye
fixed upon the happy eternity which
a joyful resurrection must introduce,
and whereof Christs resurrection
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48026:16"/>
should be the great and most assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring

<hi>that David being a Prophet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">26.</note> 
               <hi>and
knowing that God had sworn with an
oath to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that of the fruit of his

raise up Christ to sit on his throne.</hi> He
seeing this before, spake of <hi>the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of Christ,</hi>
               <note place="margin">V. 31.</note> (it appears he spake
not at random, but as knowing and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48026:17"/>
seeing before, what he spake) <hi>That
his soul was not left in hell,</hi> &amp;c. nor
can we think he thus rejoyces in
another's resurrection, forgetting
his own.</p>
            <p>And yet we have a further evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
from the Apostle St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 13. V. 32, 33, 34.</note> who
affirms that <hi>the promise made to the
fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God had fulfilled to their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
in that he had raised up Jesus
again; as it is also written in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
Psalm, Thou art my Son, this
day have I begotten thee; and as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that he raised him up from the
dead, now no more to return to corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he said on this wise, I will give
you the sure mercies of David.</hi> Which
it is now apparent must be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood
of eternal mercies, such as
Christ's resurrection, and triumph
over the grave, doth ensure to us.
He therefore look't upon what was
spoken concerning his Kingdom
here, as spoken ultimately of Christs,
the Kingdom whereby he governs
and conducts his faith<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ul Subjects,
through all the troubles of Life, and
terrors of Death (through both
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48026:17"/>
whereof he himself as their King
and Leader hath shown the way)
unto eternal blessedness, and upon
the Covenant, made with him as the
Covenant of God in Christ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
that blessedness, and the
requisites thereto. And (to say no
more in this argument) how other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
can we conceive he should have
that fulness of consolation in this
Covenant, when he lay a dying, as
we find him expressing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23 5.
(for these were some of the last
words of <hi>David,</hi> as we see <hi>v. 1.) He
hath made with me an everlasting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
ordered in all things and sure;
for this is all my salvation, and all my
desire.</hi> What so great joy and solace
could a dying man take in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
made with him, when he had
done with this world, and was to
expect no more in it, if he took it
not to concern a future blessedness
in another world? Was it only for
the hoped prosperity of his House
and Family when he was gone? This
(which is the only thing we can
fasten on) he plainly secludes in the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48026:18"/>
next words,—<hi>although he make it
not to grow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it was his reflection
upon those loving-kindnesses men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in the former part of the
Psalm, contained in God's Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,
and confirmed by his Oath,
but understood according to the
sense and import already declared,
that caused this sudden turn in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
spirit; And made him that
lately spoke as out of a <hi>Golgotha,</hi> as
if he had nothing but death in his
eye and thoughts; to speak now in
so different a strain, and (after some
additional pleadings, in which his
faith further recovers it self) to
conclude this Psalm with solemn
praise: <hi>Blessed be the Lord for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more,
Amen and Amen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We see then the contemplation of
his own and all mens mortality, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractly
and alone considered, cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
his soul with black, wrapt it
up in gloomy darkness, makes the
whole Kind of Humane Creatures
seem to him an obscure shadow, an
empty vanity: But his recalling
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48026:18"/>
into his thoughts a succeeding state
of immortal life, clears up the day,
makes him and all things appear in
another hue, gives a fair account
why such a Creature as Man was
made; and therein makes the whole
frame of things in this inferior
World, look with a comely and
well-composed aspect, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of a wise and rational design.
Whence therefore we have this
ground of discourse fairly before us
in the words themselves:
<q>That the short time of man on
Earth, limited by a certain una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable
Death; If we consider it
abstractly by it self, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
to a future state, carries
that appearance and aspect with
it, as if God had made all men

to each; but to the former
more briefly.</p>
            <p>1. It were vain, <hi>i. e.</hi> little other
than a shew, a meer shadow, a sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of Beeing. We must indeed,
in the present case, even abstract
him from himself, and consider
him only as a mortal dying thing;
and as to that of him which is so,
what a contemptible nothing is he!
There is an appearance of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what;
but search a little, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
into it, and it vanishes into a
meer nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is found a lye, a
piece of falshood, as if he did but
feign a beeing, and were not. And
so we may suppose the <hi>Psalmist</hi> speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
upon the view of his own, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48026:19"/>
the common case of man, how fast
all were hastning out of life; and
laying down the beeing which they
rather seemed to have assumed and
borrowed, than to possess and own:
Lord, why hast thou made Man
such a fictitious thing? given him
such a mock-beeing? Why hast
thou brought forth into the light
of this world such a sort of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
that rather <hi>seem to be,</hi> than
are? That have so little of solid
and substantial beeing? and so little
deserve to be taken for realities?
that only serve to cheat one another
into an opinion of their true exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and presently vanish and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
their falshood? What hovering
shadows, what uncertain Entities
are they? In a moment they are
and are not. I know not when to
say I have seen a man. It seems as if
there were some such things before
my eyes; I perswade my self that
I see them move and walk to and
fro, that I talk and converse with
them; But instantly my own sense
is ready to give my sense the lye:
They are on the sudden dwindled
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:48026:20"/>
away, and force me, almost, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg
a Delusion. I am but
mockt with a shew; and what
seem'd a reality, proves an Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture.
Their pretence to beeing, is
but fiction, and falshood; a cozen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
of over-credulous unwary sense,
They only personate what, they are
thought to be; and quickly put off
their very selves, as a disguise. This
is agreeable to the language of
Scripture elsewhere. <hi>Surely men of
low degree are vanity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2. 9.</note> 
               <hi>and men of high
degree are a lye,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In two respects may the present
state of man seem to approach near
to nothingness; and so admit this

            <p>1. The <hi>Minuteness,</hi> the small por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or degree of beeing which this
mortal part of man hath in it. It is
truly said of all created things,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48026:20"/>
Their <hi>non esse,</hi> is more than their
<hi>esse.</hi> They have more no-beeing
than beeing. It is only some limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
portion that they have, but
there is an infinitude of beeing
which they have not. And so, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
infinitely nearer to nothingness,
than fulness of beeing, they may
well enough wear the name of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi>
Wherefore the first and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain-beeing,
justly appropriates to
himself the name, <hi>I am;</hi> yea, tells
us, <hi>He is, and there is none besides
Him,</hi> therein leaving no other name
than that of <hi>Nothing,</hi> unto Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
And how much more may
this be said of the material and
mortal part, this outside of man,
whatever of him is obnoxious to

of man hath nothing steady or

frame and composition, he is,

is a continual defluence and access

would follow, that besides his sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique

which we are now to abstract) no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of him remains; He is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
thing; The former man is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
and gone; while he is, he
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48026:21"/>
hastens away; and within a little
is not. In respect of the duration,
as well as the degree of his beeing,
he is next to nothing.<note place="margin">Job 27. 19</note> He opens his
eye, and is not. Gone in the twink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of an eye. There is nothing in
him stable enough, to admit a fixed
look. So it is with the whole scene
of things in this material world. As
was the true Maxime of an Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent:
All things slow,<note place="margin">Heracl.</note> nothing stays;
after the manner of a River. The
same thing which the Apostle's
words more elegantly express: <hi>The
fashion of this world passeth away.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.</note> The
scheme, the shew, the pageantry of
it. He speaks of it but as an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
as if he knew not whether to
call it something or nothing, it was
so near to vanishing into nothing.
And therefore he there requires, that
the affections which mutual near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in relation challenges, be as if
they were not: That we rejoyce in
reference to one another, (even most
nearly related, as the occasion and
scope of his discourse teach us to
understand him) but as if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyced
not, and to weep as if we
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48026:22"/>
wept not. Which implies, the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
merit no more; and are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
as if they were not. Whence
therefore a continued course of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense
passion were very incongruous
towards so discontinuing things.</p>
            <p>And the whole state of man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
but a shew, the pomp and glit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
of the greatest men, make the
most splendid and conspicuous part
of it: yet all this we find is not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise
reckoned of, <hi>than an image,

<hi>[vain],</hi> as it signifies <hi>useless,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable,
or to no purpose. And in
this sense also, if we consider the
universal mortality of mankind
without respect to a future state;
There were a specious ground for
the expostulation, <hi>Why hast thou
made all men in vain?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:48026:22"/>
               <hi>Vanity</hi> in the former notion
speaks the emptiness of a thing, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely
and in it self considered;
In this latter relatively, as it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
to and measured by an end.
That is, in this sense, vain, which
serves to no end, or to no worthy
and valuable end; which amounts
to the same. For in as much as all
ends, except the last, are means also
to a further end; if the end im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
aimed at be vain and
worthless, that which is referred
to it, as it is so referred, cannot but
be also vain.</p>
            <p>Whereupon now let us make tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
what end we could in this case
think man made for.</p>
            <p>Which will best be done by taking
some view
<list>
                  <item>1. Of his nature.</item>
                  <item>2. Of the ends for which, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that supposition, we
must suppose him made.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I. Of the former (neglecting the
strictness of Philosophical disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion)
no more is intended to be
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48026:23"/>
said than may comport with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
of a popular discourse. And it
shall suffice therefore, only to take
notice of what is more obvious in
the nature of man, and subservient
to the present purpose. And yet
we are here to look further than the
meer surface and outside of man,
which we only considered before;
and to view his nature, as it is in it
self: and not as the supposition <hi>of
its having nothing but what is mortal
belonging to it,</hi> would make it: for as
the exility (and almost nothingness)
of man's being considered accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to that supposition, did best
serve to express the vanity of it, in
the former notion that hath been
given of a <hi>vain thing:</hi> So the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency,
and solid substantiality of it,
considered as it is in it self, will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
most to the discovery of its
vanity in this latter notion thereof.
That is, if we first consider <hi>that,</hi>
and then the supposition of such a
Creature's being only made to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish.
And if what shall be said here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
do, in the sequel, tend to destroy
that above-mention'd supposition,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48026:23"/>
(as it, being established, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
the prime glory of Humane
Nature) it can only be said <hi>magna est
veritas,</hi> &amp;c. In the mean time we
may take a view, in the nature of
man,</p>
            <p>1. Of his <hi>Intellective Powers;</hi>
Hereby he frames notions of things,
even of such things as are above
the sphere of sense; of moral good
and evil, right and wrong, what is
vertuous and what is vicious; of
abstract and universal natures. Yea,
and of a first beeing, and cause, and
of the wisdom, power, goodness,
and other perfections which must
primarily agree to him. Hereby he
affirms and denies one thing of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as he observes them to agree
and disagree, and discerns the truth
and falshood of what is spoken or
deny'd. He doth hereby infer one
thing from another, and argue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
into firm and unwavering assent
to many things, not only above the
discovery of sense, but directly
contrary to their sensible appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.</p>
            <p>2. His power of <hi>determining
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48026:24"/>
himself,</hi> of chusing and refusing,
according as things are estimated,
and do appear to him. Where also
it is evident how far the objects
which this faculty is sometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised
about, do transcend the
reach of all sensible nature; as well
as the peculiar nobleness and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
is remarkable of the faculty
it self.</p>
            <p>It hath, often for its object, things
of the highest nature, purely spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
and divine; Vertue, Religion,
God himself. So as that these (the
faculty being repair'd only by san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying
grace; not now first put
into the nature of man) are cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen
by some, and, where it is not
so, refused ('tis true) by the most,
but not by a meer not-willing of
them (as meer brutal appetite also
doth not-will them, which no
way reaches the notion of a refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal)
but by rejecting them, with
a positive aversion, and dislike,
wherein there is great iniquity and
sin: which could not be but in a
nature capable of the opposite tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:48026:24"/>
And it is apparent this faculty
hath the priviledg of determining
it self; so as to be exempt from the
necessitating influence of any thing
forreign to it. Upon the supposal
whereof, the managery of all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
affairs, all Treaties between
man and man, to induce a consent
to this or that; The whole frame
of government, all Legislation and
distribution of publick Justice do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.
For take away this suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and these will presently appear
most absurd, and unjust. With what
solemnity are applications and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses
made to the Will of man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
all occasions? How is it courted
and solicited and sued unto? But
how absurd were it so to treat the
other Creatures, that act by a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
of Nature in all they do? to
make supplications to the Wind, or
propound articles to a Brute? And
how unjust, to determine and inflict
severe penalties for unavoidable and
necessitated actions and omissions?</p>
            <p>These things occurr to our first
notice, upon any (a more sudden and
cursory) view of the nature of man.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48026:25"/>
And what should hinder, but we
may infer from these that there is
further in his nature,</p>
            <p>3. <hi>A capacity of an immortal
state, i. e.</hi> that his nature is such,
that he may, if God so please, by
the concurrent influence of his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
power, and providence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the help of a miracle, subsist in
another state of life, after this, even
a state that shall not be liable to that
empairment and decay that we find
this subject to. More, is not (as yet)
contended for; and so much me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks,
none should make a difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to admit, from what is evidently
found in him. For it may well be
supposed that the admitting of this
(at least) will seem much more easie,
to any free and unprejudic'd reason,
than to ascribe the operations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
instanc'd in, to alterable or pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishable
matter, or indeed to any
matter at all. It being justly presu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med,
that none will ascribe to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
as such, the powers of ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
or volition. For then every
particle of matter must needs be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,
and intelligent (an high ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48026:25"/>
to what one would never
have thought at all active). And
how unconceivable is it, that the
minute particles of matter, in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves,
each of them destitute of any
such powers, should by their mutual
intercourse with one another, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
furnisht with them! That
they should be able to understand,
deliberate, resolve, and chuse, being
assembled and duly disposed in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel
together; but, apart, rest all in
a deep and sluggish silence! Besides,
if the particles of matter howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
modifi'd, and moved, to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
subtilty or tenuity, and to the
highest vigour, shall then become
intelligent and rational, How is it
that we observe not, as any matter
is more subtil, and more swiftly and
variously moved, it makes not a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernably
nearer approach, (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably)
to the faculty and
power of reasoning? And that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
more of an aptitude or ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
towards intelligence and
wisdom, is to be perceived in an
aspiring Flame, or a brisk Wind,
than in a clod or a stone? If to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48026:26"/>
understand, to define, to distinguish,
to syllogize, be nothing else but
the agitation and collision of the
minute parts of rarified matter
among one another; methinks
some happy Chymist or other,
when he hath mist his designed
mark, should have hit upon some
such more noble product; and,
by one or other prosperous subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
have caused some tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary
resemblance (at least) of
these operations. Or, if the paths
of Nature, in these affairs of the
mind, be more abstruse, and quite
out of the reach and road of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
atchievement; Whence is
it that Nature her self (that is
vainly enough supposed by some to
have been so happy, as by some
casual stroaks to have fabricated
the first of humane Creatures, that
have since propagated themselves)
is grown so effete and dull, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
since to hit upon any like effect
in the like way. And that no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords
of any time or age give us the
notice of some such Creature sprung
out of some <hi>Epicurean</hi> Womb of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48026:26"/>
the Earth, and elaborated by the
only immediate hand of Nature, so
disposing the parts of matter in its
constitution, that it should be able
to perform the operations belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the mind of man.</p>
            <p>But if we cannot with any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
pretence or shew of reason
attribute these operations to any
meer matter, that there must be
somewhat else in man to which
they may agree, that is distinct
from his corruptible part; and
that is therefore capable, by the
advantage of its own nature of
subsisting hereafter (while God
shall continue to it an influence
agreeable to its nature, as he doth
to other Creatures).</p>
            <p>And hence seems a modest and
sober deduction, That there is in
the nature of man, at least, a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of an immortal state.</p>
            <p>Now if we yet suppose there is
<hi>actually</hi> no such state for man here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after:
It is our next business to
view the ends for which, upon
that supposition, he may be
thought to have been made. Whence
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48026:27"/>
we shall soon see, there is not any
of them whereof it may be said,
This is that he was created for,
as his <hi>adaequate</hi> End.</p>
            <p>And here we have a double A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
to be accommodated with a
suitable End:
<list>
                  <item>Man now made. And</item>
                  <item>God who made him.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Man himself.</hi> For it must be
considered, that in as much as man
is a Creature capable of propound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to himself an end, and of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
knowingly and with design
towards it (and indeed uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of acting otherwise as a man):
It would therefore not be reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to speak of him, in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course,
as if he were meerly pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive,
and to be acted only by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
But we must reckon him ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged,
in subordination to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,
to intend and pursue (him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self)
the proper end for which he
appointed and made him. And
in reason we are to expect, that
what God hath appointed to be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48026:27"/>
his proper end, should be such as
is in it self most highly desirable,
suitable to the utmost capacity of
his nature, and attainable by his
action, so carrying with it suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
inducements, both of desire
and hope, to a vigorous and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
prosecution of it. Thus we
must, at least, conceive it to have
been in the primitive institution of
man's end (unto which the expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stulation
hath reference, <hi>Wherefore
hast thou made all men in vain?)</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we can think of no ends
which men either do or ought to
propound to themselves, but by
the direction of one of these
principles, <hi>Sense, Reason,</hi> or <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. <hi>Sense</hi> is actually the great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctator <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/>
to the most of men, and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facto,</hi>
determines them to the mark
and scope which they pursue, and
animates the whole pursuit. Not
that sense is by it self capable of
designing an end, but it too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
inclines and byasses Reason
herein. So that Reason hath no
other hand in the business, than
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48026:28"/>
only as a slave to Sense, to form
the design and contrive the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
which may most conduce to
it, for the gratification of sensual
appetite and inclination at last.</p>
            <p>And the appetitions of sense
(wherein it hath so much mastery
and dominion) are but such as we
find enumerated 1 <hi>John 2. 16. the
lust of the flesh, the lust of the eye,
the pride of life.</hi> Or (if we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
the Apostle to use the name
of lust objectively) the objects
sufficiently connote the appetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
themselves. All which may
fitly be refer'd to Sense, either the
outward senses, or the fancy and
imagination, which, as deservedly,
comes under the same common
denomination.</p>
            <p>Now who can think the satisfy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of these lusts the commensu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
end of man? Who would
not, upon the supposition of no
higher, say with the <hi>Psalmist,
Wherefore hast thou made all men in
vain?</hi> To what purpose was it for
him to live in the world a few
years, upon this account only, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48026:28"/>
so go down to the place of silence?
What is there in the momentary ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillations
of man's wanton flesh;
in his pleasing-view of a Mass of
Treasure (which he never brought
with him into the world, but only
heaped together, and so leaves
not the world richer or poorer
than he found it)? What is there
in the applause and admiration of
fools (as the greater part always
are); that we should think it
worth the while for man to have
liv'd for these things? If the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion
were put, Wherefore did
God make man? Who would not
be asham'd so to answer it, He
made him to eat and drink and
take his pleasure; to gather up
wealth for he knows not who;
to use his inventions that each one
may become a talk and wonder
to the rest; and then when he
hath fetcht a few turns upon the
Theater, and entertained the eyes
of beholders with a short scene of
impertinencies, descend, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be heard of more? What?
that he should come into the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:48026:29"/>
world furnisht with such powers
and endowments for this? It were
a like case as if one should be clad
in scarlet to go to plough, or cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously
instructed in arts and sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
to tend Hogs.</p>
            <p>Or, <hi>2dly,</hi> if we rise higher to
the view of such ends as more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
<hi>Reason</hi> may propose, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the compass only of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
state; we will suppose that
it be either,</p>
            <p>The acquisition of much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,
the furnishing his understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with store of choice and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digested
notions; that he may
please himself in being (or in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
men think him) a learn'd
Wight; Death robs away all his
gain. And what is the world the
better? How little shall he enrich
the clods, among which he must
shortly lye down, and have his
abode! Or how little is the gain
when the labour and travel of so
many years is all vanished and
blown away with the last puff of
his dying-breath? and the fruit
that remains, is to have it said
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48026:29"/>
by those that survive, <hi>There lies
learned dust?</hi> That any part of his
acquisitions in that kind descend
to others, little betters the case,
when they that suceeed are all
hastening down also into the same
ignoble dust. Besides that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease
of sorrow, both because
the objects of his knowledg, the
more he knows, do multiply the
more upon him, so as to beget a
despair of ever knowing so much
as he shall know himself to be
ignorant of; And a thousand
doubts, about things he hath more
deeply considered, which his more
confident (undiscovered) igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
never dreamt of or suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
And thence an unquietness and
irresolution of mind, which they
that never drove at any such mark
are (more contentedly) unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with. And also because,
that by how much knowledg hath
refin'd a man's soul, so much
it is more sensible and perceptive
of troublesome impressions from
the disorderly state of things in
the world; which they that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48026:30"/>
only with earth and dirt,
have not spirits clarified and fine
enough to receive. So that except
a man's knowing more than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
were to be referr'd to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
state, the labour of attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thereto, and other accessory
disadvantages, would hardly ever
be compensated by the fruit or
pleasure of it. And unless a man
would suppose himself made for
torment, he would be shrewdly
tempted to think a quiet and
drowsie ignorance an happier
state.</p>
            <p>Or if that a man's Reason,
with a peculiarity of temper, guide
him to an active, negotiating life,
rather than that of contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and determine him to the
endeavour of serving mankind,
or the community to which he
belongs. By how much the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier
actions he performs, and by
how much more he hath perfected
and accomplisht himself with
parts and promptitude for such
actions; The loss and vanity is
but the greater thereby, since he,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:48026:30"/>
and those he affected to serve, are
all going down to the silent grave.
Of how little use are the Politici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,
the States-man, the Senator,
the Judg, or the Eloquent man?
If we lay aside the consideration
of their subserviency to the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the world in a more compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
and orderly state, for the
prosecution of the great designs
of Eternity, when, ere long, all
their thoughts shall perish! What
matter were it what became of
the world, whether it be wise or
foolish, rich or poor, quiet or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet,
govern'd or ungovern'd?
Whoever should make their order
and tranquillity their study, or
that should intend their thoughts
and endeavours to the finding
out the exactest methods and rules
of government and policy, should
but do as they that should use a
great deal of pains and art in the
curious adorning, and trimming up
of a dying person. Or as if some
one, among many condemned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,
should be very solicitous to
have them march with him in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:48026:31"/>
very exact order to the place of
Execution. If the World be not
looked upon as a 'tiring-room to
dress one's self in, for an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
on the Eternal Stage; but
only as a great Charnel-house,
where they undress, and put off
themselves, to sleep in everlasting
darkness; How can we think it
worth a thought? or to be the
subject of any rational design or
care? Who would not rather bless
himself in a (more rational) neglect,
and regardlesness of all humane af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs?
and account an unconcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
indifferency the highest wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom?</p>
            <p>Yea, <hi>3dly,</hi> If we suppose <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi>
(which we need not (because
it is mentioned in this order) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
exclusive of Reason, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
perfective of it: Reason ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
first found out God, Religion
adores Him) to become with any,
the Ruling-principle, and to have
the direction and government of
the Man, as to his way and end;
How would even that, languish
with the best, were the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48026:31"/>
of a future state laid aside,
which, with so few, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, hath any efficacy at all to
command and govern their lives?</p>
            <p>Religion terminates upon God:
And upon him under a double no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
either as we design service
and honour to him; or as from
him, we design satisfaction and
blessedness to our selves.</p>
            <p>Now if a man's thoughts, and
the intention of his mind be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
towards God under the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
notion; How great an allay
and abatement must it needs be to
the vigour and zeal of his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
who shall with the most
sincere devotedness apply himself
to serve His interest and glory,
to reflect upon the universal mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of himself and mankind,
without any hope of compensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to it by a future immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity?</p>
            <p>It is agreed on all hands, that
the utmost contributions of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
can add nothing to Him.
And that our glorifying Him doth
only consist, either in our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48026:32"/>
Him glorious, our selves;
or representing him so to others.</p>
            <p>But how little doth it signifie?
and how flat and low a thing
would it seem, that I should only
turn mine eye upwards, and
think a few admiring-thoughts of
God this hour, while I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
my self liable to lose my
very thinking-power, and whole
beeing the next! Or if we could
spread His just renown, and gain
all the sons of men to a concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
with us, in the adoring
of His Soveraign Excellencies;
how would it damp and stifle
such loyal and dutiful affection,
to consider, that the universal
testimony, so deservedly given
Him, shall shortly cease for ever!
And that infinitely blessed Being,
be ere long (again, as he was
from Eternity before) the only
Witness of his own glory!</p>
            <p>And if the propension of a man's
soul be towards God under the
latter notion also, in order to a
<hi>satisfaction</hi> that shall thence ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crew
to himself (which design,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48026:32"/>
both in the pursuit and execution
of it, is so conjunct with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
that it cannot be sever'd) It
cannot but be an unspeakable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution
and check to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
delights in this kind, to think
how soon they shall have an end.
That the darkness and dust of the
grave shall shortly obscure and
extinguish the glory of this light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some
scene.</p>
            <p>To think every time one enters
that blessed Presence, for ought
I know, I shall approach it no
more! This is possibly my last
sight of that pleasant Face! my
last tast of those enravishing plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures!
What bitterness must this
infuse into the most delicious
sweetness our state could then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit!
And by how much more
free and large Grace should be in
its present communications; and
by how much any soul should be
more experienc't in the life of
God, and inured to divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
so much the more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
and afflictive resentments it
could not but have of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48026:33"/>
end of all; And be the
more powerfully tempted to say,
Lord, why was I made in vain?
How faint and languid would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
be after the knowledg
of that God, whom I may but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
know, and dye? How impotent
and ineffectual would the attracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of this end be to man in his
terrene state, to raise him above
the world, and rescue him from
the power of sensible things, to
engage him in the pursuit of that
sanctity and purity which alone can
qualifie him for converse with
God, to bear him out in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
against the (more natural) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
of sense; When if with
much labour and painful striving,
much self-denial, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d severity to
the flesh, any disposition should be
attained to relish divine pleasures;
it be considered all the while, that
the end of all may be as soon lost
as it is gained. And that possibly
there may be no more than a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
pleasure to recompence the
pains and conflicts of many years;
although, in this case, the continual
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48026:33"/>
hope and expectation of some far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
manifestation and fruition,
might much influence a person
already holy, and a great lover
of God, unto a stedfast adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to him; yet how little would
it do to make men such, that are
yet unsuitable and disaffected to
him? or even to recover such out
of their lapses, and drowsie fits,
that are not altogether so?</p>
            <p>And it is further to be consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that since God hath given man
a beeing capable of subsisting in
another state (as doth appear by
what hath been already said):
And since he is therefore capable
of enioying a greater happiness
than his present state can admit of;
that capacity will draw upon him
a most indispensable obligation to
intend that happiness as his end,
For admit that there be no future
state for him, it is however impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible
any man should know there is
none; and upon an impartial view
of the whole case, he hath enough
to render it (at least) far more
likely to him that there is. And
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48026:34"/>
certainly he cannot but be obliged
to pursue the highest good (even
by the Law of Nature it self)
which his nature is capable of;
which probably he may attain,
and which he is no where forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
by his Creator to aspire unto.
Whence therefore, if we now cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumscribe
him within the limits
of this present mortal state; or
if, for argument's sake, we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
eventually there is no other;
we must not only confess that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
to be given him in vain,
but that he is obliged also to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
the principal endeavours of
his life, and all his powers in
vain (for certainly his principal
endeavour ought to be laid out in
order to his principal end): That
is, to pursue that good which he
may attain, but never shall; and
which is possible to him, but not
upon any terms future.</p>
            <p>And if it be admitted that the

all objections against any such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistencies,
and make him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to act in pure obedience to

his Maker (whether he signifie his
will by the Law of Nature only,
or by any positive Precept) though
he shall not hereafter enjoy any
permanent state of blessedness, as
the consequent reward; That ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and goodness, an holy rectitude

enough to themselves. That
there is that justice and sweetness in
Religion, to oblige him to love,
and reverence, and adore the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Majesty this moment, though
he were sure to perish for ever,
and be reduced to nothing the
next. I say, admitting all this,
yet</p>
            <p>2. Since the <hi>blessed God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
is to be considered as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
Agent and Designer in this
enquiry <hi>[Why hast thou made all men
in vain?]</hi> It is with modest and
humble reverence to be considered,
what end worthy of that infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perfect Beeing, he may be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed
to have propounded to
Himself, in forming such a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of so improvable a nature,
and furnished with so noble facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48026:35"/>
and powers, for so transient
and temporary a state. And how
well it will consist with the most
obvious and unquestionable noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
we can have of an absolutely
perfect Being, and the Attributes
which he most peculiarly challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
and appropriates to himself
(so as not only to own, but to
glory in them) that he should give
beeing not to some few only, but
to the whole species of humane
Creatures, and therein communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
to them a nature capable of
knowing, of loving, and enjoying
himself in a blessed eternity, with
a design to continue them only
for some short space on earth, in
a low imperfect state, wherein
they shall be liable to sink still
lower to the vilest debasement of
their natures, And yet, not for
their transgression herein (for 'tis
the mortality of man not by sin,
but by Creation, or the design of
the Creator only, that is now sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed)
but for his meer pleasure
to bereave them of being, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
them all again to nothing?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:48026:35"/>
It is to be considered, whether
thus to resolve and do, can any
way agree to God, according to
our clearest and most assured con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
of him; not from our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soning
only, but his discovery of
himself. For, otherwise, we see, the
imputation falls where we should
dread to let it rest, of having <hi>made
man in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He is, in common account, said
to act vainly, who acts beneath
himself, so as to pursue an end alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
unworthy of him, or none
at all.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that some single acts
may be done by great Persons, as a
divertisement, without dishonoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
reflection, that may seem much
beneath them. And if any do stoop
to very mean offices and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to do good, to help the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed,
and relieve the miserable,
it is a glorious acquest; and the
greater they are, the higher is the
glory of their condescending good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
Benignity of nature, and a
propension to the most unexpected
acts of a merciful self-d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48026:36"/>
when the case may require it, are
the most comely ornaments of
Princely Greatness, and out-shine
the glory of the richest Diadem.
But a wonted habitual course of
mean actions, in great persons, that
speak a low design, or no design
at all; but either an humour to
trifle, or a mischievous nature
and disposition, would never fail
to be thought inglorious and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous;
as may be seen in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of <hi>Sardanapalus</hi>'s spinning,
and <hi>Domitian</hi>'s killing of Files.</p>
            <p>When Wisdom and Goodness are
in conjunction with Power and
Greatness, they never perswade
a descent but upon such terms, and
for such purposes, that a more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
advancement shall ensue.
Wisdom foreseeing that end, and
Goodness readily taking the way,
which (though it were most unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signed,
or not aimed at as an end)
could not fail to effect it.</p>
            <p>Nor are any Attributes of the
Divine Beeing more conspicuous
than th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se; more testified by Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
or more generally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48026:36"/>
by all men that have not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny'd
his existence. Or if any have
done that violence to their own
minds, as to erase and blot out
thence the belief of an existing
Deity; yet, at least, while they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it, they cannot but have this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of what they deny; and grant
that these are great perfections,
and must agree to God, upon sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
that He do exist. If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
He should do any thing repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
to these, or we should suppose
Him to do so, we should therein
suppose Him to act below a God,
and so, as were very unworthy of
Him.</p>
            <p>And though it becomes us to be
very diffident of our own reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
concerning the Counsels and
Designs of that Eternal Being: so
as if we should find him to assert
any thing expresly of himself,
which we know not how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
with our own preconcei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
thoughts, therein to yeeld him
the cause, and confess the debility of
our understandings. Yet certainly
it were great rashness, and void of
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48026:37"/>
all pretence, to suppose any thing,
which neither he saith of himself,
nor we know how, consistently, to
think.</p>
            <p>Nor are we, in judging of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs,
to bring him down to our
model, or measure him by man,
whose designs do for the most part
bespeak only his own indigency,
and are levelled at his own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
and the bettering some way
or other of his present condition.
Whatsoever the great God doth
towards his Creatures, we must un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand
him to do, though with
design, yet from an exuberant ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of life and beeing, by which he
is uncapable of an accession to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.
And hence that he can, in
reference to himself, have no other
inducement to such action, besides
the complacency which he takes
in diffusing his free communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
(for he <hi>exercises loving-kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
judgment and righteousness
in the earth,<note place="margin">Jer. 9. 24,</note> because he delights in
these things);</hi> and the maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the just honour and reputation
of his government over his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48026:37"/>
who as they are of him,<note place="margin">Rom. 11. 36.</note> and
through him, must be all to
him, that he may have glory for
ever.</p>
            <p>Now though it be most un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
true, that the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty
of his power, and domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
over his Creatures (of which
he hath no need, and to whom
he so freely gave beeing) is so
absolute and unlimited, that, if
we consider that only, we must
acknowledg he might create a
Man or an Angel, and annihilate
him presently: yea, that he might,
if he so pleased, raise up many
Thousand Worlds of intelligent
and innocent Creatures into be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in one moment, and throw
them into nothing again the very
next moment.</p>
            <p>Yet how unwarrantably should
we maim the notion of God, if
we should conceive of him only,
according to one Attribute, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
the consideration of the
rest! How mishapen an Idea
should we bear of him in our
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48026:38"/>
minds! And how would it deform
the face of Providence, and spoil
the Decorum of his Administrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
if they should be the effects
of one single Attribute only, the
other having no influence on the
affairs of the world! If nothing
but <hi>Mercy</hi> should appear in his
dispensations towards sinful man,
so that every man might do what
were good in his own eyes, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
cause of fear to be called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count;
If the most dissolute and
prophane were equally assured of
his favour, with those who are
most holy, and strictly regular in
all their conversation; what
would be thought of God and
Religion? Or how should we sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
the notion of an impure
Deity taking pleasure to indulge
the wickedness of men? And if

of Affairs, and every
act of sin be followed with an
act of sudden vengeance, and the

Theater, and all men held in an
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48026:38"/>
hopeless expectation of fiery indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,
and of judgment without
mercy; What would become of
that amiable Representation, and
the consolatory thoughts we have
of God, and of that love and
duty which some souls do bear
towards him? Or if <hi>Power</hi>
should affect daily to shew it self
in universal appearances and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
in changing every hour the
shapes of the Terrestrial Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
in perpetual quick innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the courses of the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stial,
with a thousand more
kinds of prodigious events that
might be the hourly effects of
unlimited power; How were the
order of the World disturb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d,
and how unlovely an Idea would
it beget in every intelligent Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of him that made and rules
it? Yet is it from no defect of
Mercy, that all men are not
equally favoured and blessed of
God; nor of Justice, that a spee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
vengeance is not taken on all;
nor of Power, that the World is
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48026:39"/>
not filled with astonishing won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
every day; but rather from
their unexcessiveness; and that they
make that blessed temperature
where they reside, and are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised
in so exact proportion, that
nothing is ever done unworthy of
Him who is, at once, both perfectly
Merciful, and Just, and Powerful,
and Wise, and hath all Perfections
eminently comprehended and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in His own most simple Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>It were therefore besides the
purpose to insist only what Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
Power, considered apart,
might do; but we are to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
what may be congruous to
Him to do, who is infinitely
Wise and Good, as well as Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful.</p>
            <p>1. And first, let it be weighed,
how it may square with this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Wisdom to give being to a
World of reasonable Creatures, and
giving them only a short time of
abod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> in being, to abandon them
to a perpetual annihilation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:48026:39"/>
Wisdom in any Agent must
needs suppose the intention of
some valuable End of his action.
And the Divine Wisdom where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it hath any End divers from
that which his pure Goodness
and Benignity towards his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
would incline him to (which
also we must conceive it most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
to promote and further)
cannot but have it chiefly in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign;
it being determined that his
goodness should open it self, and
break forth into a Creation, and
that of reasonable Creatures, so
to manage his government over
these (which indeed are the only
subjects of government in the
strict and proper notion of it) as
may most preserve his authority,
and keep up his just interest in
them, both by recommending
him to their fear, and love; to
possess them with that due and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
reverence of him, that
may restrain them from contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
sinning; and so endear his
government to them, as to engage
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:48026:40"/>
them to a placid and free obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
            <p>But how little would it agree
with this design of the Divine
Wisdom, to have made man only
for this temporary state?</p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p>1. How little would it tend to
the begetting and setling that
fear of God in the hearts of men,
that were necessary to preserve
his authority and government
from a prophane contempt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
daily experience shews, that
there's now no difference made
between them that fear God, and
them that fear him not, unless
wherein the former are worse
dealt with, and more exposed to
sufferings and wrongs; That at
least 'tis often (yea for the most
part) so, that to depart from
iniquity is to make one's self a
prey; that those who profess and
evidence the most entire devoted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to God, and pay the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
observance and duty to him,
become a common scorn upon this
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:48026:40"/>
very account; and are in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
danger to be eaten up as
bread, by those that call not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
God, while, in the mean time,
the Tabernacles of Robbers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sper,
and they that provoke God
are secure, are not plagued as
other men, nor in trouble as other
men. And judgment is not here
executed for wicked works in this
world: If also nothing is to be
expected (either of good or evil)
in another, who is likely to be
induced (in this case) to fear
God, or be subject to him? And
how unlike is this to the wisdom
of the Supream Ruler, to expose
his most Rightful and Soveraign
Authority, to the fearless and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
affronts of his own revolted
Creatures, without any design of
future reparation to it! as if he
had created them on purpose on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to curse him, and dye! But he
hath prevented the occasion of so
reproachful a Censure, and thought
fit to fill his Word and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences
of guilty sinners with
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48026:41"/>
threats and dreadful presages of a
future judgment, and state of pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment.
To which he is no less
concern'd, both in point of wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and veracity (and I may add,
of Legal Justice) to make the
event correspond, that he may
neither be found to have omitted
any due course, for prevention or
redress of so great an evil; and
that, if the threatning do not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
over-awe sinners, the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
may, at least, right himself:
And that, in the mean time, he do
not (that which would least of all
become him, and which were most
repugnant to his nature) make use
of a solemn fiction to keep the
world in order, and maintain his
government by falshood and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit,
that is, by threatning what he
knows shall never be.</p>
            <p>2. Nor were there (in the case
all along supposed) a more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
provision made, to conciliate
and procure to the Divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty
the love which it is requisite he
should have from the children of
men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:48026:41"/>
And this cannot but be thought
another apt method for his wisdom
to pitch upon, to render his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
acceptable, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
men to that free and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placential
subjection which is suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to a God. For how can that
filial and dutiful affection <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ver be
the genuine product or impress of
such a representation of the case
between God and them; that is,
that they shall be most indispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
obliged to devote their whole
being, and all their powers, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
to his Service and Interest;
exactly to observe his strictest
Laws, to keep under the severest
restraint their most innate relu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctant
inclinations; and in the mean
time expect the administrations of
Providence to be such, towards
them, that they shall find harder
usage all their days, than his
most insolent and irreconcilable
Enemies, and at last lose their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Beings they know not how
soon; and therewith (necessarily)
all possibilities of any future recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence.
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48026:42"/>
Is this a likely way to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
love, and to captivate hearts
into an affectionate and free obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence?
Or what is it probable to
produce, but a sowr and sullen
despondency, the extinction of all
generous affection, and a temper
more agreeable to a forc'd en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thralment
to some malignant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting
Genius, than a willing sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
to the God of all Grace and
Love?</p>
            <p>And every one will be ready to
say, There is little of wisdom in
that Government, the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
whereof is neither apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
fear or love in those that are
subject to it: but either through
the want of the one to be despised,
or to be regretted through the
want of the other.</p>
            <p>And this being the very case, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
supposition of no future state;
It seems altogether unworthy of
the Divine Wisdom, that such a
Creature should ever have been
made, as Man, upon which no
end is attainable (as the course of
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:48026:42"/>
Providence commonly runs in this
world) in comparison whereof, it
were not better, and more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to his Maker, (whose inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest
it is the part of his wisdom to
consult) that he had never been.
And therefore as to God, and the
just and worthy designs of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
he would seem upon this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
wholly <hi>made in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. And Secondly, How congru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and agreeable would this sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
prove to the Goodness of
God? As that other Attribute of
Wisdom doth more especially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
His own interest; so doth
this, the interest of his Creatures:
That is, if it be understood, not in
a Metaphysical, but in a Moral
sense, as it imports a propensity
and steddy bent of will unto bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,
according to that of the
<hi>Psalmist,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 119. 68.</note> 
               <hi>Thou art good, and dost
good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this free and generous Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
it is, which gives the first
rise and beginning to all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs
any way respecting the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48026:43"/>
and happiness of Creatures,
which, then, infinite wisdom forms
and manages to their full issues
and accomplishment, guiding (as
it were) the hand of Almighty
Power in the execution of them.</p>
            <p>That there should be a Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
we may conceive to be the first
Dictate of this Immense Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
which afterwards diffuses it
self through the whole, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
agreeable to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of every Creature. So that
even this inferior, and less noble
part,<note place="margin">Psal. 33. 5</note> the Earth, is <hi>full of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It creates first its own object,
and then pours forth it self upon it
with infinite delight, rewarding
the expence with the pleasure of
doing good.</p>
            <p>Now if we should suppose such
a Creature as Man made only for
that short time and low state,
which we see to be allotted him
in this world; It were neither
difficult, nor enough, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> with strict Justice,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48026:43"/>
which upon the ground of absolute
dominion, may do what it will
with its own: But the ill accord
it seems to have with so large
and abounding Goodness, renders
it very unlike the Dispensation
of the blessed God. No enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
being in that case afforded
to this sort of Creatures, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to their common nature and
capacity, either in <hi>degree</hi> or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not in <hi>degree:</hi> for who sees
not that the nature of man is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of greater things than he
here enjoys? and where that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
is rescued from the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
that narrows and debases
it, how sensibly do holy souls
resent and bewail their present
state, as a state of imperfection!
With how fervent and vehement
desires and groans do they aspire
and pant after an higher and more
perfect! <hi>We that are in this taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
do groan,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Cor. 5. 4.</note> 
               <hi>being burdened; not
for that we would be unclothed</hi> (that
is not enough, to be delivered
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48026:44"/>
out of the miseries of life, by lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down this passive part, is not
that which will terminate their
desires) <hi>but clothed upon, that
mortality might be swallowed up of
life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theirs are not brutal groans,
the complaint of opprest sensitive
nature under a present evil; but
rational and spiritual, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
of desire strongly carri'd
to pursue an apprehended suitable
good.</p>
            <p>The truest notion we can yet
have of the primitive nature and
capacity of man, is by beholding
it in its gradual restitution. And
is it agreeable to the goodness of
God to put such a nature into
any, and with-hold the suitable
object? As if it were a pleasure
to him to behold the work of his
own hands spending it self in
weary struglings towards him, and
vext all the while it continues in
being, with the desire of what
it shall never enjoy? and which
he hath made it desire, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48026:44"/>
therein encouraged it to expect?</p>
            <p>Nor in <hi>continuance:</hi> For I
suppose it already evident, that
the nature of man is capable (in
respect of his principal part) of
perpetuity, and so of enjoying a
felicity hereafter, that shall be
permanent and know no end. And
it seems no way congruous to so
large Goodness, to stifle a capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
whereof it was it self the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
and destroy its own work.</p>
            <p>For if the Being of man is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
for so short a continuance,
either he may have the knowledg
of this determination concerning
him, or not: If he cannot have
the knowledg of it, why should
any one say what they cannot
know; or put such a thing upon
God, that is so vilely reflecting,
and dishonourable to him? If he
may have the knowledg of it,
then doth he seem a Creature
made for torment, while, by an
easie reflection upon himself, he
may discern he is not uncapable
of a perpetual state; and is yet
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48026:45"/>
brought forth into the light, to
be, ere long, extinguish't, and
shut up in everlasting darkness.
And who can think this a thing
worthy of infinite and eternal
Goodness? Besides (as hath been
insisted before) that this torture,
proceeding from so sad an expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
cannot but be most grievous
and afflictive to the best. Whence
the Apostle tells us, that Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
<hi>if in this life only they had
hope,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 19.</note> 
               <hi>were of all men most miserable.</hi>
So that it were more desirable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to have been. If any yet, fall
hereafter into a state to which they
would prefer perpetual annihilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
in as much as it is wholly by
their own default, it no way re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects
upon Divine Goodness. But
it would be a dishonourable refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
rather upon that Author
and Fountain of all Goodness, if he
should not express himself wise and
just as well as good; as it would
upon a man, especially a Ruler over
others, if that which we call good
nature were conjunct with stoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48026:45"/>
or an insensibleness of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever
affronts to his Person and
Government.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, therefore, it
seems most repugnant to these
great Attributes of the Divine
Being, to have made man only for
this present state. That to think so,
were to conceive unworthily of him,
as if he had acted much beneath
himself, and done a vain thing in
making such a Creature, no end
being attainable by it, which we
can suppose either his Wisdom or
Goodness to aim at.</p>
            <p>If any would imagine to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
an expedient, by supposing
an eternal succession of humane
generations, upon whom the Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Goodness of God might
have a perpetual exercise in the
government and sustentation of
them for their appointed times:
This would be far from satisfying,
as to either; but would rather
encrease the difficulty. For there
would be the same temptation
upon all the Individuals, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48026:46"/>
or regret the Government
of their Maker.</p>
            <p>So that he should hereby even
eternize his own reproach; and
should always, in every successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
have still the same craving
appetites returning, and expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
never to be satisfied; which
were as repugnant to all he hath
discovered to us of his nature, as
any thing we can suppose.</p>
            <p>Though some persons of a light
and <hi>desultory</hi> humour, might ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
to themselves a pleasure in
it, if they had the power to
make such a rotation of things,
rising and falling, coming and
passing away, at their beck and
command; and such as were of a
<hi>Sanguinary</hi> Temper, might sport
themselves in raising up and lop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
off lives at pleasure with an
arbitrary hand. Yet sure they
would never gain by it the esteem
of being either wise or good; and
would 'tis like, in time, grow
weary of the sport. But to form
to our selves such Idea's of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48026:46"/>
blessed God, were an injury not
inferior to the vety denial of his
being.</p>
            <p>His providence towards the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
Creatures, hath no resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
of any such thing; whom
his bounty sustains agreeably to
their natures, who have no fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight
of their own cessation from
being, to keep them in a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
death by the expectation of
it. And who serve to valuable and
reasonable purposes, while they are
continued; for they are useful,
partly to the sustentation of man,
and partly to his instruction, in
order to his higher Ends.</p>
            <p>And though each individual
of them do not actually so, it is
sufficient that the several kinds of
them are naturally apt thereto,
which are propagated according
to a setled course and Law of
Nature in their individuals. And
if all immediately serve not man,
yet they do it mediately in ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
those that more immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
do. Besides that when such a
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48026:47"/>
work was to be done, as the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing
out, and accomplishing
this lower world; It was meet all
things should be in number, weight
and measure, and correspond in
every part. As if one build a
House for entertainment, though
the more noble Rooms only do
come in view, yet all the rest are
made answerably decent, on sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
that they may. It was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
the august and great Lord
of this world, that it have in it,
not only what may sustain the
indigent, but gratifie the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative,
by fresh variety; who
would be apt to grow remiss by
conversing only with what were
of every days observation. Nor
was that a low end, when such
contemplation hath so direct a
tendency to raise a considering
mind to the sight, and love, and
praise of the Supream Being, that
hath stampt so lively signatures
and prints of his own perfection
upon all his works.</p>
            <p>If it be said, Man might be in
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48026:47"/>
the same kind serviceable to the
contemplation of Angels, though
he were himself never to know
any other than this mortal state.
'Tis true, that he might so; but
yet the incongruities were no way
salved, of God's putting a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and expectation into his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of a better state. Of his
dealing so hardly with them, that
he hath procured to love him.
Of his never vindicating their high
contempt, that spent their days
in rebellion against him.</p>
            <p>Besides, that these were ill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents,
and no pleasant Theams
for the view of an Angelical
mind. And if they see a nature
extinct, capable of their state,
what might they suspect of their
own?</p>
            <p>So that which way soever we
turn our thoughts, we still see
that man's mortality, and liable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to an unavoidable death, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted
from the thoughts of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
state, carry that constant as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
as if <hi>all men were made in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:48026:48"/>
What remains then, but that
we conclude hence, we ought

our eye to this dark and gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
Theam, Death, and the
Grave, or with-hold it from look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to think the wise and holy God
hath given being to man (and

series of Providence tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
so many successive Ages to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
him) <hi>in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing but a prospect of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
state can solve the knot, and
work through the present difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
can give us a true account of
man, and what he was made
for.</p>
            <p>Therefore since it would be
prophane and impious, sad and
uncomfortable, a blasphemy to
our Maker, and a torture to our
selves, to speak it as our setled
apprehension and judgment, That

this great Principle of Truth in

state, after this life is over.</hi>
Unto which this present state is
only preparatory and introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive.</p>
            <p>For whereas we can never give a
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:48026:49"/>
rational account why such a Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
as man was made, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
all ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> apprehensions concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
him to his present state on
earth: Let them once transcend
those narrow limits, flye over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
eternity, and behold him made
for an everlasting state hereafter;
and the difficulty now vanishes,
the whole affair looks with a
com<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ly and befitting aspect.</p>
            <p>For we may now represent the
case thus to our selves. That
man was put into this terrestrial
state and dwelling, by the wise
and righteous designation of his
great Creator and Lord, that his
Loyalty to him amidst the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
and enticements of sensible
things, might be tried a while:
That revolting from Him, he is
only left to feel here the just
smart of his causeless defection.
That yet such farther methods
are used for his recovery, as are
most suitable to his so empaired
state. An allayed light shines to
him in the midst of darkness, that
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48026:49"/>
his feebler eye may receive a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
illumination, and behold God
in those more obscure discoveries
which he now vouchsafes of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
till by degrees he be won to
take up good thoughts of him,
and return into an acquaintance
and friendship with him; which
once begun here, shall be hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
perfected in eternal fruitions.
The offence and wrong done to
his Maker, he in a strange un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought
of way makes compensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of to himself. And testifies
his reconcileableness, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swades
a reconciliation upon such
terms, and by so endearing Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

hearts of Adamant; and shall ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually
prevail with many to
yeild themselves the Subjects and
Instances of his admired goodness
for ever; while others lye only

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>olly. So are the
glorious issues of God's dispensati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
towards man, and the wise
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48026:50"/>
and merciful conduct of his equal
Government, worthily celebrated
through the days of Eternity
with just acclamations and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
We can fasten upon nothing
ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ptionable or unaccountable,
yea, or that is not highly lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and praise-worthy in this course
of procedure.</p>
            <p>Therefore, though now we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
a dark Cloud of Mortality
hanging over the whole Humane
Race; Though we see the grave
still devouring, and still unsatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that all are successively
drawn down into it; and we
puzzle our selves to assign a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
why such a Creature was
made a reasonable Being, capable
of an everlasting duration, to visit
the world only, and vanish; to
converse a short space with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
and affairs so far beneath it,
and retire we know not whither.
If yet our eye follow him through
the darker paths of the Region of
Death, till at the next appearance
we behold him cloathed with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48026:50"/>
and fitted to an endless
state, the wonder is over, and our
amusement quickly ceases.</p>
            <p>Wherefore l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and therefore cannot be supposed
to have done any thing to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose;
much less when all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
Creatures have Ends visibly
answering the exigency of their
natures, to have made so excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
a Creature as Man (the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler

in vain; that He only should be
without his proportionable end,
and after a short continuance in
being, return to nothing, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
leaving it conjecturable what
he was made for. This were so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable
an incongruity, and so
unlike the footsteps that every
where else appear of the Divine
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48026:51"/>
wisdom and goodness, that we
cannot but enquire further into
this matter, and conclude at last,
That he was made for some high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
purposes than are within the

he made us for no more worthy
Ends. And let us but impartially
debate the matter with our selves:
Can we, in sober reason, think
we were made only for such Ends

can it enter into our souls to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
it? Would not men be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shamed

Or to have it written in their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads,

and Conscience, Death also
will yeild them as easie a victory,
or be afraid to encounter men of
so redoubled courage; that the

his Laws for their sakes, or

that they shall never be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

only there, with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
as persons that bore much
sway in their Countrey, and
could number so many Hundreds
or Thousands a year; that, at
least, the infernal flames will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
presume to touch so worthy
Personages; that Devils will be
awed by their Greatness, and fear
to seize them, lest they should
take it for an affront. No conceit
can be imputed to these men ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd
enough to over-match the
absurdity of their practice. They
can themselves think nothing more
gross and shameful, than what
they daily are not ashamed to act.
For what absurdity can be compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
in a thought, greater than
what appears in a course of life
managed in perpetual hostility to
all Principles of Reason and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity?
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48026:53"/>
And either they must own
all the impious solly of such
thoughts; or confess, upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

in their thinking-faculty it
self. For either they think their
course justifiable, or they do not.
If they do, how fatally are all
things inverted in their depraved
minds? Wisdom and Folly, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
and Vice, Good and Evil,
seem to them transform'd into one
another, and are no longer to be
known by their Names. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
notions of all mankind are
but blind fancies in comparison of

so) are reason enough with them
to mock at the Eternal Being, and
attempt to jeer Religion out of
the world, and all other men out
of their reason and wits, as they
have themselves. And sure this
must be their only pretence; and
their Atheism the best reason, upon
which to justifie their constant
practice. For who can think,
(while he sees them not yet in
chains) they should be so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
mad, as to acknowledg only
such a Deity (the Author and
Ruler of all things) whose favour
were worth nothing? or to be
procured by affronts? to whom
contempt were a sacrifice? and
the violation of whatsoever is Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred,
the most effectual propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
or acknowledg him for a
God whom they hope to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power,
and to prosper in a War
against him?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:48026:54"/>
And if they acknowledg none at
all, and this be the fundamental
Article of their Creed, That there
is indeed none; Then can no man
charge them with any thought
more grosly foolish than their own,
nor can they devise to say any thing,
by which more certainly to argue
themselves berest of the common
understanding of men. For who
that is not so, if he only take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of his own being, may not as
certainly conclude the existence of
a God, as that two and two make
four? Or what imagination can
be too absurd to have place in that
mind that can imagine this Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to be a casualty? He would
be thought besides himself that
should say the same of the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition
of a Clock, or a Watch,
though it were a thousand times
more supposable. But if they do
not justifie themselves, to what
purpose is it further to press them
with absurdities, that persist in
constant self-contradiction? or that
have not so much left them of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48026:55"/>
sensation, as to feel in their
own minds the pressure of the very
greatest absurdity?</p>
            <p>If they only presume they do
well, because they have never askt
themselves the question, or spent
any thoughts about it; this speaks
as much a besotted mind, as any of
the rest; and is as unworthy of
a reasonable Creature. Why have
they the power of thinking? Or
who do in any case more general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
incurr the censure of impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
and folly, than they who
have only this plea for their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
That they did not consider?
Especially when the case is so
plain, and the most sudden refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
would discover the iniquity
and danger of their course.</p>
            <p>And one would think nothing
should be more obvious, or more
readily occurr to the mind of a
man, than to contemplate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self,
and taking notice there is
such a Creature in the world, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
with such abilities and
powers, to consider, What was I
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48026:55"/>
made for? What am I to pitch
upon as my proper End? Nor any
thing appear more horrid to him,
than to cross the very Ends of his
Creation.</p>
            <p>2. It may also be improv'd to
the <hi>directing of our Practice.</hi> For
which purpose we may hence take
this general Rule, <hi>That it be such
as becomes the expectation of a future
state.</hi> For what else is left us, since
in our present state we behold
nothing but vanity?</p>
            <p>We see thus stands our case, that
we must measure our selves by one
of these apprehensions; Either <hi>[we
are made in vain];</hi> or <hi>[we are
made for a future state].</hi> And can
we endure to live according to
the former? As if we were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinencies
in the Creation, and
had no proper business in it? What
ingenuous persons would not blush
to be always in the posture of an
useless hang-by? to be still hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on, where he hath nothing to
do? that if he be asked, Sir, what's
your business here? he hath nothing
to say?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:48026:56"/>
Or how can we bear it, to live
as if we came into the world by
chance? or rather by mistake? As
though our Creation had been a
misadventure, a thing that would
not have been done, had it been
better thought on? And that our
Maker had overshot himself, and
been guilty of an oversight, in gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
us such a being? Who that
hath either just value for himself,
or any reverence for his Maker,
could endure either to undergo
the reproach, or be guilty of the
blasphemy which this would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port?
And who can acquit him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
of the one or the other, that
lives not in some measure agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
to the expectation of some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
beyond this present life?
Let us therefore gird up the loins
of our minds, and set our faces as
persons designing for another
world; so shaping our course,
that all things may concur to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
to men the greatness of
our expectations. We otherwise
proclaim to the world (to our
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48026:56"/>
own and our Creator's wrong)
that we have reasonable souls gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
us to no purpose. We are
therefore concern'd and obliged
both to aim at that worthy End,
and to discover and make it visible
that we do so.</p>
            <p>Nor is a design for an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
state so mean and inglorious,
or so irrational and void of a so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid
ground, that we have any
cause either to decline or conceal
it; either not to retain, or to be
ashamed of our hope.</p>
            <p>Nor is there any thing to be
done in prosecution of it, so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
as to need a corner, or
merit to be done as a work of
darkness.</p>
            <p>Neither yet is it a vain-glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ostentation, or the affectation
of making shew of an excellency
above the vulgar pitch that I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade
to: But a modest sober a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowing
of our high design and
hope; neither making any near
approach to a proud arrogance on
the one hand; nor a mean pusil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimity
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48026:57"/>
on the other. Truly
great and generous spirits know
how to carry under Secular Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
with that prudent and grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<hi>decorum</hi> as shall signifie a just
owning of themselves without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solence
towards others. Real worth
though it do not vaunt, will shew
it self; and while it doth not
glare, yet cannot forbear to
shine.</p>
            <p>We should endeavour the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
of a spirit refin'd from
earth and dross, and aspiring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a state of immortality, may
<hi>express it self;</hi> and shine in its <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
lustre;</hi> with its <hi>own,</hi> not with
borrowed beams; with a constant,
even, natural; not with an une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
artificial light. That all that
will, may see, by the steddy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
of our course, that we are
aiming at the great things of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world. Though we, all the
while, are not so much solicitous
to have our end and purpose
known, as to obtain it.</p>
            <p>And verily, since the vile sons
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48026:57"/>
of the earth, the men of sense,
that aim at no other end than to
gratifie their brutal appetite with
such pleasure as is only to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd
within a short li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s-time in
this world; and who live to the
reproach of their Maker, and of
mankind, do not go about to hide
the infamy of their low design, or
conceal the degenerous baseness
of their mean spirits; but while
they make their belly their God,
and only mind earthly things, do
also glory in their shame: How
much were it beneath the state
and spirit of the sons of God, that
are worthily designing for a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
immortality, to be ashamed of
their glory? or think of stealing a
passage to Heaven in the dark?</p>
            <p>No; let them know, it is not
only too mean a thing for them
to involve themselves in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
spirit of the sensual world,
but even to seem to do so. And
that this is so soul and ignomini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
a thing, as whereof they are
concern'd, not to be free from the
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48026:58"/>
guilt only, but the suspition.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.</note>
Those worthy souls that in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
(and darker) days were enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
in seeking the Heavenly
Countrey, thought it became
them to confess themselves <hi>pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims
and strangers on the earth:</hi> And
therein, to declare plainly, that
they were seeking that better Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.
Which confession and plain
declaration, we need not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
to be meerly verbal, but
practical and real also, such as
might be understood to be the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of their lives, and of a
constant uniform course of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
agreeable to such a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore bethink our
selves, what temper of mind,
and manner of life may be most
conformable to this design, and
best become persons pretending to
it: Whereupon we should soon
find our own thoughts instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
us, that such things as these
would be most becoming, and fit,
in reference thereto; and which,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:48026:58"/>
we may therefore take as so many
particular directions how to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern
our spirits, and behave our
selves answerably to so great an
expectation.</p>
            <p>1. That we endeavour for a
calm indifferency and dispassionate
temper of mind towards the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
objects and affairs that belong
to this present life. There are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
narrow limits already set, by
the nature of the things themselves,
to all the real objective value that
such things have in them: And
it is the part of wisdom and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice
to set the proportionable
bounds to all the thoughts, cares,
and passions, we will suffer to stir
in our minds in reference to them.
Nothing is a more evident acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
Character of a Fool, than
upon every slight occasion to be
in a transport. To be much taken
with empty things, betokens an
empty spirit. It is a part of manly
fortitude to have a soul so fenc't
against forreign impressions, as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to be mov'd with things that
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:48026:59"/>
have little in them. To keep our pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
under a strict rein, and steddy
command, that they be easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractable,
and taught to obey. Not
to move till severe Reason have
audited the matter, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc't
the occasion just and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable.
In which case the same
manly temper will not refuse to
admit a proportionable stamp and
impress from the occurring ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:
For it is equally a prevari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
from true Manhood, to be
mov'd with every thing, and with
nothing. The former would speak
a man's spirit a feather, the latter
a stone. A total apathie and insen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibleness
of external occurrents,
hath been the aim of some, but
never the attainment of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
pretenders. And if it had, yet
ought it not to have been their
boast; as upon sober thoughts it
cannot be reckoned a perfection.
But it should be endeavour'd, that
the passions which are not to be
rooted up (because they are of
Nature's planting) be yet so dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:48026:59"/>
check't and deprest, that
they grow not to that enormous
tallness, as to over<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>op a man's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
power, and cast a dark
shadow over his soul.</p>
            <p>A rational authority must be
maintained, a continency and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
of one's self, that there be
not an impotent profusion, and
we be never so affected with any
thing, but that the object may
still be able to warrant and justifie
the affection, both for the nature
and degree of it.</p>
            <p>Which rule if we strictly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,
and apply it to the present
case, we shall rarely meet with
any temporal concern that ought to
move us much: both for the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleness
of such things themselves,
and that we have so unspeakably
greater things in our view and
design.</p>
            <p>In con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ormity therefore to our
so great Expectation, we ought
more particularly to watch and
repress our inclinations, appetites,
and affections towards each several
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:48026:60"/>
sort and kind of objects which
time and this present state hath
within the confines of it. As,</p>
            <p>How contemptuously should we
look upon that empty vanity of
being <hi>rich?</hi> How coldly and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
should we pursue; how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concern'dly
should we lose any
thing that might intitle us to that
Name?</p>
            <p>The pursuit of so d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>spicable a
trifle, with violent and perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
desire, so as hereby to suffer a
diversion from our design for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world, is to make our eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
hope less than nothing (For to
any man's calm and sober thoughts
<hi>this</hi> will be found as little). And
so will amount to a total quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of all our pretensions to
a (better) future state; that is,
when we so indulge this odd, ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational,
this wildly sanciful, and
purely humoursome appetite (of
which no man can give any tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
account), that it becomes
ravenous, when it devours a man's
time, his thoughts, the strength
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:48026:60"/>
and vigour of his spirit, swallows
up his nobler designs, and makes
an idle doting about he knows
not what, or why, his main busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
            <p>Especially when Conscience it
self becomes a sacrifice to this
impure, unhallowed Idol; and the
question is wholly waved, Is this
thing just and honest? and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is considered, but that its
commodious and gainful.</p>
            <p>Yet (if herein we will take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us to pass a judgment upon
other men) it will be no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous
or just, that in smaller
and disputable matters, we make
our own apprehensions a measure
and standard to them. They are
commonly aptest to do so, who
have least studied the matter, and
have nothing but their ignorant
confidence to intitle them to the
Dictator's Chair; where, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
having placed themselves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
they liberally bestow their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
and reproaches on all that
think ir not fit to throw away
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48026:61"/>
their own eyes, and see with their
bad ones. And conclude them to
have no Conscience, who go not
according to theirs. And that they
cannot but have some base design,
who in any thing presume to
swerve from their judgment, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if the advantage, in any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
respect, happen to lye on that
side from which they dissent.</p>
            <p>Nothing can indeed so comport
with the spirit and design of one
who believes himself made for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
world, as a brave and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
disdain of stooping to the
lure of present emolument, so as
thereby to be drawn into any the
least thing which he judges not
disensible by the severest Rules of
Reason and Religion; which were
to quit a serene Heaven for mire
and dirt.</p>
            <p>There is nothing in this world of
that value, or worthy to be bought
so deer, as with the less and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiture
of the rest and repose of a
mind quiet, benign, peaceful, and
well pleased with it self. It is
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48026:61"/>
enough if one find himself, by diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
which he cannot master,
constrained to dissent from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
above exception wise and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
placidly, and without unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
confidence, to go on in
the way which his present judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
allows, carrying with him
a modest sense of humane infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and how possible it is the
error may lye on his own part:
Having, yet, to relieve him against
that supposition, the clearness of
his own spirit, the conscience of
his innocency of any ill dispositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or design; of his instructible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and preparedness to admit a
conviction if he err. And be he
never so fully perswaded about
the thing in difference, yet to
consider the smallness of it, and
how little cause he hath of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying,
if he know in this matter
more than others, who, possibly,
know ten times more than he, in
far greater and more important
matters.</p>
            <p>But, in matters clearly determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48026:62"/>
by common agreed Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
to prevaricate out of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence
to meer appetite; To
give up one self to practices ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently
immoral and flagitious,
only to comply with, and lest he
should not satisfie sensual desires, is
the Character of one who hath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
the common hope of all
good men; and who, that he may
have his lot with beasts in this
world, dreads not to have it with
Devils in the other.</p>
            <p>And it is upon the same ground,
equally unbecoming them that
pretend to this hope, to be visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
concern'd and discompos'd for
losses and disappointments they
may meet with in this kind, when
unexpected events withstand their
having much of this world, or
deprives them of what they have.
It becomes them that reckon their
good things are to come hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
to shew by their equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment
and cheerful aspect in
any such case, that they apprehend
not themselves toucht in their
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48026:62"/>
most considerable Interests. Yea,
though they suffer not losses only,
but injuries; and besides that they
are damnifi'd (as much as such
things can signifie) they find
themselves wrong'd; and though
further trouble and danger threaten
them in the same kind, They
should evidence how much it is
above the power either of chance
or malice, not only to make them
miserable, but even to disturb or
make them sad. That they are
not happy by a casualty; And
that their happiness is not in the
command of them who cannot
command their own. That it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
depends on the inward consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
and frame of their own
spirits, attempered to the blessed
objects of the invisible world,
whereby they have the assurance of
enjoying them fully hereafter, and
the present grateful relishes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in the mean time: and hence,
That they can be happy without
the world's kindness, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite
of its unkindness. That they
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48026:63"/>
have somewhat within them, by
which they are enabled to rejoyce
in tribulation; being troubled on
every side, yet not to be distress'd:
To <hi>take joyfully the spoiling of goods,
knowing within themselves they have
in Heaven a better and enduring
substance.</hi> Not to suffer or discover
any perturbation or disquiet. Not
to have their Souls ruffled or put
into disorder; Nor let any Cloud
sit on their brow, though dark
and dismal ones seem to hang over
their heads.</p>
            <p>And the same absurdity it would
be to indulge to themselves an
unbounded liberty of sensual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures.
For that looks like a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
of futurity; as if a day were
a mighty gain for eating and drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
because to morrow we must
dye. An abstemious shyness here is
comely. A tasting only the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights,
whereof others suffer
themselves to be ingulft. A pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
reservednes and restraint, so
as that what shall cause with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
an unbeseeming transport,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:48026:63"/>
and diffusion of themselves, be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd,
not with a Cynical mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity,
but a pleasant composure,
and well order'd complacence;
keeping a due and even distance
between levity and sourness.</p>
            <p>Yet there is a natural retired<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in some mens tempers; and
in others an aversion to pleasures,
proceeding only of a rational esti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
of their emptiness and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
in themselves; which may,
however, much fall short of wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
the present case requires: The exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency
whereof is no way satisfied,
but where such a moderation to
the product of a comparative judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
between the delights of the
present, and those of the future
state: When one so enjoys any
thing in this world, as to be under
the power of nothing, because of
the more prevailing influence he
is under from the power of the
world to come: When his Faith
is the Parent of his Sobriety; and
his denial of worldly lusts flows
from the expectation of the blessed
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48026:64"/>
hope: When, because he more
highly prizes, and lest he forfeit
eternal pleasures, he so behaves
himself towards all temporary
ones, as neither to abuse those
that are lawful, nor to be abused
by the unlawful; not to exceed
in the one, nor to touch with the
other.</p>
            <p>Thus also ought we to look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Secular Honours and Dignity;
neither to make them the matter
of our admiration, affectation, or
envy. We are not to behold them
with a libidinous eye, or let our
hearts thirst after them. Not to
value our selves the more for them
if they be our Lot: nor let our
eye be dazled with admiration, or
distorted with envy, when we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
them the ornaments of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
            <p>We are not to express that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
of them, which may make
a breach on civility, or disturb the
order and policy of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
whereto we belong. Though
this be none of our own Countrey,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48026:64"/>
and we are still to reckon our
selves but as pilgrims and stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
while we are here; yet it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
not strangers to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent
or rude in their behaviour,
where they sojourn; how much
soever greater value they may justly
have of their own Countrey. We
should pay to Secular Greatness
a due respect, without Idolatry,
and neither despise nor adore it;
considering at once the requisite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of such a thing in the present
state, and the excelling glory of the
other. As, though in prudence

in thy homage (so that it befalls
into the Supplicant's power to be

this absurdity? And what ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

to it (as the Philosopher to the

are not at leisure to mind so mean
things. We have somewhat else to do
than to talk of you.</hi> He hath still
the image before his eye, of this
world vanishing and passing away;
of the other, with the everlasting
affairs and concernments of it,
even now ready to take place, and
fill up all the stage: and can repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
to himself the vision (not
from a melancholick fancy or cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
brain, but a rational faith, and
a sober well instructed mind) of
the World dissolving, Monarchies
and Kingdoms breaking up,
Thrones tumbling, Crowns and
Scepters lying as neglected things.
He hath a Telescope through which
he can behold the glorious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of the Supream Judg, the
solemn state of his Majestick Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
the splendid pomp of his
magnificent and vastly numerous
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48026:67"/>
retinue; the obsequious Throng of
glorious Celestial Creatures, doing
homage to their Eternal King;
the quick celerity of the emissitious
Partisans covering the face of the
Heavens with their spreading
wings, and dispersing themselves
into all the four Winds to gather
the Elect: The universal silent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of all to that loud-sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Trumpet that shakes the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
of the world, pierces the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
caverns of the earth, and
refounds from every part of the
incircling Heavens: The many
Myriads of joyful Expectants ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing,
changing, putting on glory,
taking wing, and contending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
to joyn themselves to the
triumphant Heavenly Hoast: The
Judgment set: The Books opened:
The frightful amazed looks of sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized
Wretches: The equal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministration
of the final Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
The adjudication of all to
their eternal states: The Heavens
roll'd up as a scrowl; the Earth,
and all things therein, consumed
and burnt up.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="114" facs="tcp:48026:68"/>
And now what spirit is there
any more left in him towards the
trivial affairs of a vanishing world!
How indifferent a thing is it with
him, who bears himself highest in
a state of things whereof he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sees
the certain hastning end!
Though he will not neglect the
duty of his own place, is heartily
concerned to have the knowledg
and fear of God more generally
obtained in this apostate world;
and is ready to contribute his ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
regular endeavours for the
preservation of common peace and
order in subserviency hereto. Yet
abstractedly, from these confidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and such as have been before
mentioned, he is no more concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
who is uppermost, than one
would, passing by a swarm of Flyes,
which hath the longest wings, or
which excels the rest in spright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness
or briskness of motion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
And for himself, he can insert
this among his most serious
thanksgivings, That while the
care is incumbent on others, of
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48026:68"/>
watching over the publike peace
and safety, he may sit still, and
converse with God, and his own
more sedate thoughts. How se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure
is he in this, That infinite
Wisdom governs the world! That
all things shall be disposed the best
way, to the best and most valuable
ends! That an afflicted state shall
never befall unto good men, but
when it is fittest, and most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible
it should do so! That the
prosperity carnal appetite covets,
is never denied them, but when
it would be pernicious! How
calm is he in the midst of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
troubles! How placid and
serene a spirit inhabits his peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
breast! When all things are
shaken round about him, he is
not shaken. He bears all sort of
troubles, but creates none to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
nor is disturbed by any him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</p>
            <p>But they that delight to see
this world rolling or fixed, as
may most serve their private pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses;
and have a perpetual quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48026:69"/>
with it, while it looks not
kindly upon them. Their life is
bound up in it, and their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences
to another, are but the
languid faint notions of what they
never heartily believe nor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole matter, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is more agreeable to this
great expectation, than a steady
restraint, and moderation of our
passions towards things without us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
That is, all the several sorts of
external objects and affairs, that
so variously invite, and tempt
our observation and regard in this
our present state.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. I next add: A further
congruity, if we pretend to this
expectation, is, <hi>That we be not
over-much taken up in minding the
body.</hi> For this looks like a design
(or that inconsistent wish) to
have our present state perpetua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted;
And that the thoughts are
remote from us of a change for a
better. As if notwithstanding all
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48026:69"/>
that the Divine Goodness hath
promised concerning the future in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
of the free and heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
Seed, This did still lye near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
our hearts, <hi>O that Ishmael
might live in thy sight!</hi> And that
the belief did miserably languish
with us of any better portion
than what our eyes do already
behold: Together with the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension
of a spiritual being in
us, to be ripened into a compleat
and actual capacity of enjoying
what is better. It is true, that all
the exorbitant workings of those
meaner and ignoble passions that
are moved by objects aud occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
without, and forreign to us,
have the body for their first and
last, their spring and source, their
center and end. But thence it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
the more proper, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite,
that we draw nearer this
their seat and center, and strike
at the root; and, in killing that
inordinate love and solicitude for
the body, mortifie them all at
once.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:48026:70"/>
We are indeed so far to comply
with the pleasure of our Maker,
as not to despise the mean abode
which he hath assigned us for a
while in the body. But withall,
to take heed lest we so cross and
resist it, as to make caring for the
body our whole business: which
he hath only enjoyn'd us, in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serviency
to an unspeakably great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
and more important business.
Its health and welfare ought upon
very valuable accounts to be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
preserved by all prudent
means. But to indulge its slothful
desires, and comply with its licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
wild cravings, is far beneath
us, a base unmanning of our selves,
and would signifie as if so absurd a
conceit had past with us into a
setled judgment, That a reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
immortal spirit was created
only to tend and serve a Brute.
It is monstrous to behold, with
how common consent multitudes
that professedly agree in the belief
of the immortal nature of their
souls, do yet agree to debase and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48026:70"/>
enslave them to the meanest ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
to their mortal bodies; so
as these are permitted to give
Laws to them, to prescribe them
rules of living, and what their
daily employment shall be. For
observe the designs they drive,
and what is the tendency of their
actions and affairs (whence the
judgment is to be made concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their inward thoughts, delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
and resolves) and is not
the body the measure and mark of
them all? What import or signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
is there in this course, of
a design for futurity? And (which
increases the folly of it to a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der)
they can make a shift to go
on thus from year to year, and
take no notice of the absurdity!
They agree to justifie each one
himself, and one another. The
commonness of the course takes
away all sense of the horrid mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of it. And because each doth
as the rest do, they seem to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
they all do well; and that
there is nothing exceptionable in
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48026:71"/>
in the case;<note place="margin">Non qua eundum est sed qua itur. <hi>Sen.</hi>
               </note> and go on * (as the
sequacious sheep) not the way they
ought, but which they see others
go before them.</p>
            <p>But, if any place could be found
for calm and sober thoughts,
What would be reckon'd a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
impertinency, than to be at so
great pains for maintaining a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
life, without considering what
that life shall serve for? To em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
our utmost care to live, but
to live for we know not what?
It becomes us to be patient of the
body, not fond. To treat and use
our bodies as things shortly to be
put off, and laid aside. To care
for them, not for their own, but
the works sake we have to do in
them; and leave it to them to
indulge and pamper the body,
who expect never to live out of
it. Not to concern our selves, that
the circumstances of our bodily
state be such as will gratifie our
appetites, but answer the Ends
for which our Maker thought fit
we should live a while in the body.
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48026:71"/>
Reckoning with our selves, We
are lodg'd in these mean recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
(though somewhat commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously,
yet) but for a little while,
and for great purposes; and more
minding our journey, and home,
than our entertainment in our
Inn. Contentedly bearing the want
of bodily accommodations, that
are not easily to be compass'd,
and the pressure of unavoidable
bodily infirmities; not much pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tying
our selves because of them;
nor deeply regretting it, if wants
and pains pinch our flesh; nay,
though we see the outward man
perishing, so we can but find the
inward renewing day by day.</p>
            <p>3. That we set our selves with <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/>
the whole intention of our souls,
to mind the concernments of the
future state, the invisible things
of the other world; and direct the
main stream of our thoughts, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
hopes, and joys, thitherward.
For how highly justifiable and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
is it, that we principally
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:48026:72"/>
mind the state and things we were
made for? We should therefore
make these familiar to our selves,
and use our spirits to those more
noble and pleasant Theams: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting
often, how unworthy it
is of them to grovel in the dust,
or chuse the objects of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse
by such measures only as are
taken from sense.</p>
            <p>It is an iniquity which, though
God may be so gracious to us as to
forgive, we should not easily forgive
to our selves; That we have so
often chosen to converse with
empty trifles, while so great things
have invited our thoughts in
vain.</p>
            <p>Their remoteness from sense
hath little of excuse in it, and
unworthy a reasonable Creature.
Methinks they should be ashamed
to alledg it, who consider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
furnished with an intelle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
power that doth, in many
other instances, controle the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of sense, and impeach it of
falshood. Would we not blush to
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:48026:72"/>
profess it for a Principle, That
there is nothing real that exceeds
the sphere of our sense?</p>
            <p>We would reckon it a part of
modesty, not to ascribe too much
to our own Understandings, or
presume too far upon our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
Ability, against the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of sage and knowing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.
How is it then, that we
think it not immodest to oppose
the apprehensions of our dull and
incapacious sense, to the common
faith and reason of all good and
wise men, that are or have been
in the world, as well as our own?
If we have not seen what the state
of things is in the other world,
are we not told? And have we
not enough to assure us, that 'tis
He hath told us, whose nature

upon our selves, as to think we

an esteem of our own beings, as

            <p>We should therefore make this
the matter of our earnest study,
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48026:75"/>
What would be the proper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
and ornaments of our
spirits, and will most fitly qualifie
them for the state we are going
into; and of our daily observation
how such things thrive and grow
in us. Especially we should not be
satisfied, till we find in our selves
a refinedness from this earth, a
thorough purgation from all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
degrees of sensual inclination
and affection; the consumption of
our dross by a Sacred Fire from
Heaven, a Spirit of Judgment and
of Burning, an aptitude to spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
exercises and enjoyments;
high complacency in God, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
love, a worshipping posture
of soul, formed to the veneration
of the eternal Wisdom, Goodness,
Power, Holiness, profound humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and abnegation of our selves;
a praiseful frame of spirit, much
used to gratulations and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings;
a large and universal
love, imitating, as much as is pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible,
the Divine: A proneness to
do good to all; a steady compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:48026:75"/>
and serene temper of spirit;
the repose and rest of a contented
mind, not boisterous, not apt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
disquiet, or to create storms
to our selves, or the world; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
way suitable to the blissful
Regions, where nothing but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
purity, entire devotedness to
God, love, goodness, benignity,
well-pleasedness, order, and peace,
shall have place for ever.</p>
            <p>This we ought to be constantly
intent upon, as the business of
our lives, our daily work, to get
our spirits so attempered and fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to Heaven, that if we be ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
What design we drive? What
are we doing? We may be able to
make this true answer, We are
dressing our selves for Eternity:
And since nothing is required
hereto, that is simply impossible,
nothing but what is agreeable to
our natures, and would be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
to them; How worthy
and commendable an ambition
were it to be always aspiring?
not to rest or take up beneath the
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48026:76"/>
highest pitch of attainable excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency
in these kinds, reckoning
every degree thereof a due to our
natures; and that they have not
what belongs to them, while any
thing of real intrinsick moral
goodness is yet wanting; and not
only due, but necessary, and what
we shall have need of in reference
to the state we are shortly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
upon; that <hi>except such things
be in us, and abound, we cannot have
an abundant entrance into the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And should we, pretending to
such an expectation, omit such
endeavours of preparing our selves,
it were alike thing as if an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
Peasant should go about to
thrust himself, with an expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of high Honours and Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
into the Prince's Court;
or as if a distracted man should
expect to be employed in the
greatest and most intricate affairs
of State; or an uninstructed Idiot
take upon him to profess and
teach Philosophy.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:48026:76"/>
Therefore let us consider; Are
we conscious of no unfitn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ss for
that blessed state? To dwell in the
presence of the holy God? To be
associated with the H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>av<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nly As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly
of pure intellectual spirits?
To consort and joyn with them in
their celebrations and triumphant
Songs? Can we espy no such thing
in our selves, as an earthy mind,
aversation to God, as pride, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain,
wrath, or envy, admiration
of our selves, aptness to seek our
own things, with the neglect of
others, or the like? And do not
our hearts then misgive? and tell
us we are unready? not yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
to approach the Divine Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
or to enter into the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation
of his Holiness and Glory?
And what then have we to do,
but set our selves to our prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory
work? To set our watches,
make our observations, take strict
notice of all the deflections and
obliquities of our spirits, settle
our methods, and hasten a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress?
Do not we know this is the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48026:77"/>
time and state of preparation? And
since we know it, how would the
folly torture us, by reflection, of
having betrayed our selves to a
surprisal! None are ever wont to
enter upon any new state without
some foregoing preparation. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
more remarkable turn or change
in our lives, is, commonly (if at
all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>known) introduced by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
serious fore-thoughts. If a man
be to change his dwelling, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment,
condition, common
discretion will put him upon
thinking how to comport with the
place, business, converse, and way
of living he is next to betake him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
to: And his thoughts will be
the more intense, by how much
more momentous the change. If
he be to leave his Countrey, with
no probability of returning; If he
be designed to a station, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
whereof carry any
thing of awfulness in them; if
to publike business, if to Court-attendances,
With what solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and address are such things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken!
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48026:77"/>
How loath and asha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
would one be, to go into such
a condition, being totally unapt,
not at all knowing how to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
himself in it! But what so
great change as this can the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of man admit? That a soul,
long shut up in flesh, is now to
go forth from its earthly Mansi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and return no more; expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be received into the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Presence of the Eternal King,
and go act its part among the
perfected Spirits that attend His
Throne! How solicitous endeavour
of a very thorough preparation,
doth this case call for!</p>
            <p>But how ill doth the common
course of men agree to this! who
never have such matters in their
thoughts! who so much neglect
not their very Hogs, as they do
their Spirits!</p>
            <p>5. That we have much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versation <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>
with God. He is the
only full and permanent Good;
therefore the endeavour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48026:78"/>
very inward with him, doth
best agree with the expectation of a
state perfectly good and happy.</p>
            <p>To expect this, and converse
only with shadows and vanishing
things, is to expect to be happy
without a happiness; or that our
happiness should betide us as a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual
thing, or be forc'd upon us
at last whether we will or no.
But since our happiness in God is
on his part not necessary, but
vouchsafed and gratuitous, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
on meer good pleasure;
Is it our best way of ingratiating
our selves with him, to neglect
him, and live as without him in
the world? To keep our selves
strangers to him all our days, with
a purpose only of flying to him at
last, when all things else that were
wont to please us, are vanished
and gone? And if we could sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
his Wisdom and Justice to
admit his forgiving so provoking
contempt of him, and receiving
an exiled Soul forced out from its
earthly abode, that to the last mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48026:78"/>
of it would never look af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
him, or have to do with
him; yet can it be supposed, that
its own habitual aversation to him,
could allow it to be happy in
him? Especially being increased
and confirmed by its conscious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and sense of guilt? How can
these but make it banish it self,
and in a sullen enmity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spair
perp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tually fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e the Divine
Presence? What can in this case
be more natural to it, than to
give up it self to eternal solitary
wandrings, as a Fugitive from
God? to affect to be ever enwrapt
in its own darkness, and hidden
from his sight, and be an ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting
tormentor to it self? Can
we be happy in him whom we do
not love? or love whom we will
not know or be acquainted with?</p>
            <p>What sure ground of hope can
we imagine to our selves, that our
reconciliation and acquaintance
with God shall ever be brought
about, if it be not done while we
are here in the body? Will we be
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48026:79"/>
so vain, as to cherish an hope that
not only affronts the visible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of God's revelation, but the
very reason of things, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
tendency of our own spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits?
Nor indeed (if we would
consider better) can we possibly
hope for what we desire not, or
whereto our hearts are in an ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual
disaffection, other ways than
(in the present case) negatively;
and that our infidelity permits us
not to fear the contrary: yea, and
the lively hope of a blessedness in
God, as it includes desire, would
certainly infer that Purity (the
image of his own) that could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
fail to incline our hearts to
him, and which would habituate
us to a course of walking with
him in inward communion.</p>
            <p>And this were comely and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to our pretences; If
while we profess our selves made
for another state, we retire our
selves from the fading things that
put a vanity into this; and single
out, by our own choice, the stable
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48026:79"/>
good which we expect ever to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy.
How befitting is it to pass by
all things with neglect, and betake
our selves hither with this sense?</p>
            <p>Lord, I have viewed the World
over in which thou hast set me; I
have tried how this and that thing
will fit my spirit, and the design
of my Creation; and can find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
in which to rest, for nothing
here doth it self rest, but such
things as please me for a while,
in some degree, vanish and flee, as
shadows, from before me. Lo, I
come to Thee, the Eternal Being!
the Spring of Life! the Center of
rest! the Stay of the Creation!
the Fulness of all things! I joyn
my self to thee; with thee I will
lead my life, and sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd my days,
with whom I aim to dwell for
ever; expecting when my little
time is over, to be taken up, ere
long, into thy Eternity.</p>
            <p>And since we who live under the
Gospel, have heard of the Redeemer,
of the dignity of his Person, of his
high Office and Power, of his
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48026:80"/>
merciful design, and great At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievements
for the restoring of
lapsed and lost souls:</p>
            <p>It is most agreeable to our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions
of the vanity of this
present state, and our expectations
for the future, that we commit
our selves to him. That with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
trust and love, devotedness
and subjection, we give our selves
up to his happy conduct, to be
led by him to God, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stated
into that eternal blessed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
which we look for.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Kingdom is not of this
world</hi> (as we profess not to be).
We cannot be innocently igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
that its constitution and
frame, its laws and ordinances, its
aspect and tendency in its self, and
the whole course of its administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
are directed to that other
state. <hi>He hath overcome death, and
him that had the power of it; hath
brought life and immortality to light,
is the first begotten from the dead,
and the first fruits of them that
slept;</hi> hath opened Heaven to us,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48026:80"/>
and is himself ascended, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred
as our victorious triumphant
Captain and Fore-runner. He is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned
with highest Power, and
hath set up an Universal Kingdom,
extended to the utmost bounds of
this apostate World, and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Regions of innocent and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
loyal Spirits. His Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations
are issued out, his Ensigns
displayed, to invite and call in
whosoever are weary of the sin
and vanity of this wretched world,
of their alienation from the life
of God, of living in the midst of
death; to joyn themselves to Him,
the Prince and Lord of Life; and
be led by Him to the immortal
state. If the present state of
things appear dismal to us; if we
reckon it a woful spectacle to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
sin and death reigning, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness
and mortality acting their
combined parts, to waste the
world, and lay it desolate; If
we would deliver our selves, and
escape from the common ruin;
are seriously designing for Heaven,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48026:81"/>
and that World in which Death
hath no place, nor any shadow of
Death; Let us betake our selves
to Him, enroll our Names, put
our selves under his Banners and
Discipline, strictly observing the
Laws, and following the guidance
of that our invisible Lord, who
will be <hi>Author of eternal salvation
to them that obey him;</hi> and <hi>save to
the uttermost all that come to God
through him.</hi> How dear should he
be to us! How chearfully should
we trust him, how dutifully serve
him, how faithfully adhere to him,
both for his own sake, and that
of the design he hath in hand for
us, and the pleasant savour of
Heaven and Immortality which
breathes in both!</p>
            <p>But if we neglect Him, and
disown our relation to him; or
if we let days and years go over
our heads, wherein we drowsily
slumber; roll our selves in the dust
of the earth; and, while we call
our selves Christians, forget the
reason and importance of our own
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48026:81"/>
Name, and think not of our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
under his call and conduct to
the eternal Kingdom and Glory.
This is perversly to reject what
we say (only) we seek; to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
and renounce our preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to Immortality; to blast and
damn our own great hopes.</p>
            <p>Lastly, It is congruous to our <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/>
expectation of so great things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
death, That we live in a
chearful pleasant expectation of it.
For what must necessarily inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene,
though not grateful in it
self, should be reckon'd so, for
the sake of that which is. This,
only, can upon the <hi>best</hi> terms, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile
us to the grave, That our
greatest hopes lye beyond it; and
are not hazarded by it, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish't.</p>
            <p>Although, indeed, nothing were
to be expected hereafter; yet so
little suitable entertainment doth
this world afford to a reasonable
spirit, that the meer weariness of
beholding a Scene of vanity and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48026:82"/>
folly, might well make a recess ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.
For is it so grateful a
thing to observe the confused
scramble and hurry of the world?
How almost every one makes it
his business to catch from another
what is worth nothing! With
what toil, and art, and violence
men pursue, what when they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
they find a shadow! To see
deluded Mortals, each one intent
upon his own particular design,
most commonly interfering with
anothers; some impos'd upon by
others over-reaching Wit, and all
by their own folly: Some lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their losses, others their short
and unsatisfying acquisitions: Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pleasing themselves with being

What serious person? who that

He whose creative fancy could
make him golden Mountains in a
dream, create him a Prince of
Nations, give him to enjoy the
most delicious pleasures of the
world in Idea; might, with some
plausible shew of reason, be deem'd
the happier man, than he that
hath, and is all this indeed: for
his toil is less, and his victories
unbloody, his pleasures not so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure.
However, one would think
that to such whose utmost attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
end only in the pleasure of
their sense, and have but this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piphonema,
<hi>Now, let us sit down,

time might suffice for business of
no more weight; and that no

pleasures, as miseries (changes
being their only remedies, as the
Moralist speaks); or in bearing
(more sadly) the same every

the series of their calamities in the

course of their time.</p>
            <p>And surely these things consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
there wants not what

            <p>For upon the whole, let but
the case be thus put: Is it not as

it not as good to be nothing, as
to be, and do nothing? Sober

               </gap>re not
our souls and our bodies (though
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:48026:85"/>
united, yet) distinct things? Why
then should not our souls, that
are capable of understanding their
own interest, mind that first; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
most their own perfection
and improvement, and begin their
charity at home? It is nor strange,
that what is weaker and more ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noble,
should affect union with
what is above it, and a spring of
life to it: But when it is found
burdensome, nothing forbids, but
that the superior Being may be
well content, upon fair and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable
terms, to be rid of the
burden. Therefore though flesh
and blood may reluctate and shrink
at it, when we think of laying
it down; yet it becomes immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
spirits to consider their own
affairs, and be (more principally)
intent upon what will be their
own advantage. If so mean a
Creature as a sorry Flea, finding
it can draw a suitable aliment
from our bodies, affect to dwell
there, and is loath to leave us; It
were a ludicrous pity to be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therefore
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48026:86"/>
content to endure its
troublesome v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>llications, because
we fear the poor Animal should
be put to its shifts, and not to be
otherwise able to find a subsistence.
'Tis true, that the great Creator
and Lord of the Universe, hath
not permitted us the liberty of so
throwing off our bodies when we
will (which otherwise are in dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
far more beneath our spirits,
than so despicable a Creature is
beneath <hi>them).</hi> And to his dispose
that hath order'd this conjunction
for a time (whether we look upon
it as an effect of his simple plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
or of his displeasure) we
must yeild an awful and a patient
submission, till this part of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
towards us have run its
course, and attain'd its ends. And
then, how welcome should the
hour of our discharge and freedom
be, from so troublesome an Asso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate!
which upon no other ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
than that of duty towards
the Author of our beings, one
would more endure, than to have
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:48026:86"/>
the most noysome offensive Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
always preying upon his flesh.
At least, (though the consideration
of our own advantage had no
place with us in this matter) the
same sense of duty towards our
great Creator, which should make
us patient of an abode in the body,
while he will have it so; should
also form our spirits to a willing
departure, when it shall be his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to release us thence. But
that neither a regard to his ple<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
nor our own blessedn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ss,
should prevail against our love to
the body, is the unaccountable
thing I speak of. And to plead on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in the case, the corruption of
our natures that sets us at odds
with God and our selves, is to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifie
the thing by what is it self
most unjustifiable; or rather (as
some that have affected to be styl'd
Philosophers have been wont to
expedite difficulties, by resolving
the matter into the usual course of
Nature, which is) to resolve the
thing into it self, and say, <hi>It is so,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:48026:87"/>
because it is so, or is wont to be;</hi> and
indeed, plainly to confess there is
no account to be given of it. This
being the very thing about which
we expostulate, that reasonable
nature should so prevaricate: The
commonness whereof doth not
take away the wonder, but rather
render it more dreadful and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing.</p>
            <p>The truth is, the incongruity
in the present case is only to be
solved by redress; by earnest stri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings
with God, and our own
souls, till we find our selves reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
into a right mind; into the
constitution and composure where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
a generous fortitude hath a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
ingrediency; that usually
upon lower motives refuses no
change of Climate, and will carry
a man into unknown Countreys,
and through greatest hazards in the
pursuit of honourable enterprizes,
of a much inferior kind.</p>
            <p>It is reckon'd a brave and manly
thing to be in the temper of one's
mind a Citizen of the World
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:48026:87"/>
meaning it of this lower one). But
why not rather of the Universe?
And 'tis accounted mean and base
that one should be so confin'd by
his fear or sloath to that spot of
ground where he was born, as not
upon just inducement to look a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and go for warrantable and
worthy purposes (yea, if it were
only honest self-advantage) as far
as the utmost ends of the earth.
But dare we not venture a little
farther? These are too narrow
bounds for a truly great spirit. Any
thing that is tinctur'd with earth,
or favours of mortality, we should
reckon too mean for us; and not
regret it, that Heaven and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
are not to be attained but by
dying; so should the love of our
own souls, and the desire of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
state of life, triumph over
the fear of death.</p>
            <p>But it may be alledged by some,
That 'tis only a solicitous love to
their souls, that makes them dread
this change. They know it wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l
not sare with all alike hereafter, and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48026:88"/>
know not what their own lot shall
be.</p>
            <p>And is this indeed our case? then,
what have we been doing all this
while? and how are we concerned
to lose no more time?</p>
            <p>But too often a terrene spirit
lurks under this pretence; and men
alledg their want of assurance of
Heaven, when the love of this earth
(which they cannot endure to think
of leaving) holds their hearts.</p>
            <p>And (a little to discuss this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter)
what would we have to assure
us? Do we expect a vision or a
voice? or are we not to try our
selves; and search for such chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters
in our own souls, as may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish
and note us out for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?
Among these, what can be
more clear and certain than this,
<hi>that we have our hearts much set upon
it?</hi>

the notion of Heaven, or the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedness

it not to your selves a composition
of sensual enjoyments; Understand
it (principally) to consist in perfect
holiness and communion with God
(as his own word represents it, and
as reason hath taught even some
Pagans to reckon of it) and you
cannot judg of your own Right by
a surer and plainer Rule, than <hi>that
eternal blessedness shall be theirs whose
hearts are truly bent and directed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it.</hi> Admit we, then, this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple;
and now let us reason with
our selves from it: We have a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
made to us of a future state,
of blessedness in God, not as desira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
only in it self, but as attainable,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48026:89"/>
and possible to be enjoyed (the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer
having opened the way to it
by his blood, and given us at once
both the prospect and the offer of
it) so that it is before us as the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of a reasonable desire. Now ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
our hearts are so taken with
this discovery, that we above all
things desire this state, or not. If
they be, we desire it more than our
earthly stations and enjoyments, and
are willing to leave the world and
the body to enjoy it; and so did
falsly accuse our selves of a prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
aversion to this change. If they
be not, the thing is true, that we
are upon no terms willing to dye,
but the cause is falsly (or partially)
assigned: It is not so much because
we are unassured of Heaven, but
(as was above suspected) because
we love this world better, and our
hearts center in it as our most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirable
good.</p>
            <p>Therefore we see how unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
this is, often, said, We are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to change states, because we are
unassured; the truth is, they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>assured,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48026:89"/>
because they are unwilling;
and what then ensues? They are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
because they are unwilling.
And so they may endlesly dispute
themselves round, from unwilling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
to unwillingness. But is there
no way to get out of this unhappy
Circle? In order to it, let the case
be more fully understood; Either
this double unwillingness must be
refer'd to the same thing, or to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers:
If to the same thing, it is
not sense; they say what signifies
nothing: For, being to assign a
cause of their unwillingness to quit
the body, to say, <hi>because they are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing,
(viz.</hi> of that) is to assign no
cause, for nothing can be the cause
of it self. But if they refer to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
things, and say, <hi>They are unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to go out of the body, because they are
unwilling to forsake Earth for Heaven;</hi>
The case is then plain, but sad, and
not alterable, but with the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the temper of their spirits.
Wherefore let us all apply our selves
(since with none this is so fully
done, that no more is needful) to
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48026:90" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the serious endeavour of getting our
souls purged from the dross of this
world, and enamoured of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and blessedness of Heaven, so
the cause and effect will vanish to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether;
we shall find that suitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
and inclination in our spirits to
that blessedness, as may yeild us
the ground of a comfortable per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion
that it belongs to us us; and
then, not be unwilling, though ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
deaths stood in our way, to break
through to attain it.</p>
