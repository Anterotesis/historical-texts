         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

CHURCH of England, &amp;c.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Honour'd Brethren,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IF I thought the Addreſs, I here
make unto you had need of an
<hi>Apologie,</hi> it would be Uncapable
of any. My Confidence, I confeſs, is
utterly Inexcuſable, if it be not
grounded upon <hi>Reaſon.</hi> What I Deſire
therefore is only this, That you would
be Pleaſed to Condeſcend to the moſt
Serious Conſideration of what is Said
by ſo Obſcure a Perſon.</p>
            <p>I Do not Pretend to any Skill in
the Letter of Our <hi>Common Law,</hi> but
that Law which All Mankind Ought
to be, and that Law which All Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
Profeſs they are Govern'd by,
has been my Study above thirty
Years: And in the proſecution of
<hi>Charity,</hi> or <hi>Divine Love,</hi> to which All my
Speculations naturally Tend, I find
it my Duty to Endeavour with all my
might to Communicate the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
I have of this Truth: that if
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106917:3"/>
the Parliament ſhall Comply with
His Majeſties moſt Juſt, and Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Deſire of the <hi>Abrogation</hi> of all
ſuch Laws againſt the Papiſts which
are more <hi>Rigorous</hi> than any of thoſe
againſt the other <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> it
would moſt certainly conduce to the
<hi>Glory of God, and the Good of Men.</hi> If
any men ſhould ſay what Impudence
is this? Is not ſuch a Propoſal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Preſent Government?
I ſhould Confidently Anſwer, It is
not. And the Reaſons of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
I ſhall here (as well as I can
within the compaſs of a Letter) in all
Humility tender to your Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
By thoſe words of the Bleſſed
Apoſtle, <q>Do we then make void the
Law, yea we eſtabliſh the Law.</q> I am
prompted to ſay to our Adverſaries
in this Caſe, Do we ſubvert, yea we
Eſtabliſh the Preſent Government.
That this may be clearly perceiv'd,
I ſhall deſire that it may be duly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd
that whatſoever tends to the
Eſtabliſhing of the Rights of Our
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106917:3"/>
MONARCHIE does moſt certainly
tend to the Eſtabliſhing of Our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill
Government: And what is it to
Eſtabliſh the Rights of MONAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHIE
but to Secure All Due Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
to Our MONARCH and His
Succeſſors throughout All Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
Tho it be True indeed that it is
the Duty of All Subjects, Enjoyn'd
by the <hi>Fifth Commandment,</hi> to retain a
FILIAL Affection for their PRINCE
the FATHER of their Country,
whatſoever he Does, or Deſigns, yet
alas! ſince the Generality of men are
Led more by the <hi>Love of Life and Eſtate</hi>
than a Senſe of Duty towards God
and the Hopes of Glory in the World
to come, and ſince ſo many of thoſe
who are <hi>Habitually</hi> Heavenly-minded
often fall from their Better Temper,
and are carried in the ſtream of Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Intereſt, How can it be ſuppoſed,
that <hi>Subjects</hi> ſhould be <hi>United</hi> in their
Affections to their <hi>Prince,</hi> and to one
another, whilſt there are <hi>Laws Standing</hi>
againſt ſo great a Number of Them,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106917:4"/>
that are Perſons very Ingenious, very
Well bred, and of great Eſtates, many
of them of Our moſt Antient Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and many Exceeding Learned;
Laws I ſay, which if put in Execution,
would deprive them of their <hi>Lives,</hi>
or <hi>Eſtates?</hi> And what do thoſe men
Intimate that are ſo Eager againſt
the <hi>Abrogating</hi> of ſuch<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Laws but that
they Hope for a Time when they ſhall
get the Bloud of ſome of their <hi>Loyall
Fellow-ſubjects</hi> to be Shed, or their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates
taken from them, becauſe they
cannot Do what their Conſciences,
ſupported by the Concurring Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Thouſands of Sober, and
Learned men, Oblidge them not to
Do? if it ſhall be ſaid what ſignifies an
Oath to a Papiſt <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> I ſhall moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
beg that it may be conſidered
whether ſuch an Objection can have
any thing in it of <hi>Natural Conſcience,</hi> or
<hi>Common Honeſty,</hi> ſince Few, or none, that
we know of the Papiſts, who took the
Oath of Allegiance did ever Break
it, but all the world know's it was
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106917:4"/>
Broken in the moſt haynous manner that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
could be by Thouſands of that ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
who are, and ever have been moſt <hi>Bloudily</hi>
ſet againſt the Papiſts. And as for this ſort of
People, who Murthered the Father of Our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Soveraign, Attempted the Murthering of
His Brother, and the Excluding of Himſelf
from His Royal Inheritance and who were (I
think, I may ſay All of them in their Perſons,
or in their Hearts and Affections) ſo lately in
Open Rebellion againſt Himſelf, let us Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
His Majeſties moſt Mercifull and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Dealings with Them: And Admire
the Benignity of that Wiſdom which has
hitherto Govern'd Him ſince the Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence
brought Him to be Our Governour
next, and Imemediately Under the Great and
Glorious MONARCH of Heaven, and Earth.
And ſince He is ſo Kind to them, how <hi>Crooked</hi>
and <hi>Perverſe</hi> would it ſeem, if we ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to Obſtruct the <hi>Current</hi> of His Sacred
Clemency, when it Flowes towards Perſons
of His own Perſwaſion, in a way ſo juſt and
Equitable in the ſight of all men? How much
it would contribute to the Peace and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity,
the Eaſe, and Comfort of a <hi>Proteſtant
Succeſſor,</hi> if the Papiſts were freed from the
Terror of thoſe Dreadful Laws I could ſpeak
largely. But I ſhall haſten to my other Point,
to ſhew that this <hi>Lenity</hi> to the Papiſts could
be no Diſadvantage to the <hi>Church of England</hi>
but rather a great Advantage in as much as we
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106917:5"/>
ſhould thereby Declare to all the world the
Sincerity of Our Profeſſion to be <hi>Meek, and Lowly</hi>
in <hi>Heart,</hi> And that we will not be Affrighted
by the <hi>Phariſaicall Multitude</hi> from Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
All the Truth we find Profeſt, and all the
Uirtue we find Practiced by Papiſts. The <hi>Holy
Fathers</hi> and the <hi>Four Firſt Generall Councils,</hi> next
to the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> Our Church is Founded
upon; And how many Learned men in this
Kingdome began to make light of theſe Bleſſed
Records of Chriſtian Antiquity? which <hi>Grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Evill</hi> the Courſe, which His Majeſty has
taken will moſt undoubtedly Suppreſs.</p>
            <p>If theſe Dreadfull Laws were <hi>Repeal'd</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
it would take off the Edge of the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities,
which cannot but be in the Hearts of
ſome Learned Papiſts againſt the Church of
England which muſt needs make them in their
Writings more <hi>Pungent</hi> than otherwiſe they
would be. For, (poor men) they may juſtly
apprehend that the Standing of Our Church
tends to the Deſtruction of their Lives if Our
Church cannot ſtand without thoſe Severe
Laws that have been made againſt them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall give you no further trouble at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
but ſhall Commend you to the the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
and Inſtruction of the <hi>Almighty, and
Onely Wiſe God, the God of Peace, and Love,</hi> And
