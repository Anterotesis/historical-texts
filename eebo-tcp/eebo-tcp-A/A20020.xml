            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But, God hath suffred such matters to fall so out: and all to vs, for the best, yf it be so (thankfully) construed, and duly considered.</p>
            <p>For, when all forrein Princes, our Neighbors: dowtfull freends, or vndutifull People: (Subiects, or vassals) to our Soueraign, shall perceiue such a Pety-Nauy-Royall,<note place="margin">‚òû</note> houering purposly, here and there, euer rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and hable to ouerthrow any their malitious and subtile secret Attempts, intended against the weale Publike of this most Noble kingdom, in any parte or Coast thereof: Then, euery one of them, will, or may think, that, (of purpose) that Nauy was made out, onely to preuent them, and none other: And for their destruction, being bewrayed: as they wold deme. So, that, no one, such forrein Enemy, wold aduenture, first, to breake out into any notable disorder, against vs: Nor homish Subiect, or wauering vassall (for like Respects) durst, then, priuily muster, to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: Or make harmfull Rodes, or dangerous Ryots, in any English, or Irish Marches.</p>
            <p>But, such matter as this, I iudge you haue, or mought haue hard of, ere now, (by the worshipfull <hi>M. Dyer,</hi>) and that, abundandy: Seeing, <hi>Synopsis Reipub.

So that, in Totall Somme, of all the foresayd Considerations, vnited in one: Yt see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to be (almost) a Mathematicall demonstration, next vnder the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifull and Mighty Protection of God, for a faesable Policy, to bring or praeserue this Victorious Brytish Monarchy, in a marueilous Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: Whereupon, the Reuenue of the Crown of England, and Wealth-Publik,<note place="margin">‚òû</note> will wonderfully encrease and florish: And then, ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, Sea forces (a new) to be encreased, proportionally: &amp;c. And so, the Fame, Renowm, Estimation, and Loue, or Feare, of this Brytish <hi>Microcosmus,</hi> all the whole and Great world ouer, will speedily be spred, and surely be settled. &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Truly, I was carryed (almost, ere I was aware) and that, very pleasant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, into the Consideration of the manifold and Incredible great Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, that may arise to this Kingdom, by A Nauy, such, as I haue (by good Instruction) spoken of: whereas, my chief purpose was, and is, to entreat of matters, touching this Paradoxall-Cumpas, and the perfect Arte of Nauigation.

withall, at Seas, accordingly, without good skill of Nauigation: (though Nauigation, may be without a Nauy) verily, for so good a purpose, and so nere to my matter, I fauored my fantazy, while it somwhat strayed from my principall Intent. And not so, neither. For, my principall Intent and his chiefly, (whose brief Aduertisements herein I wold gladly make some Remembrance of) Is, (as it ought to be, of duty) to be fownd faithfull, seruisable, Comfortable, and profitable to the Politicall Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of this Brytish Common-wealth:<note place="margin">Euery Sub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And, So, the End of Ends, and yttermostscope of the sayd Arte of Nauigation, is such Publik Commodity, of this whole kingdom intended, and meant: that, from that Publik fowntain, very easily and certainly, may be deriued to euery priuat man, his proportionall parte of delitious Refreshing, and vitall preseruation, in very godly sort, and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tik order.</q>

            <p>Besides all this: Yt is most ernestly and carefully to be considered, that our Herring Fishings, against Yarmouth chiefly, haue not (so No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably to our great Iniury and los,<note place="margin">NOTE.</note> and the great and Incredible gayn of the Low Cuntries) bin traded, but from xxxvj. yeres agoe, hitherward.

Sayle, And they, from Threescore, to a hundred Tun, and vpward: besides Crayers, and other.

            <p>Yet, Surely, I think it necessary, to leaue to our Posterity, some Remembrance of the places, where, our rich Fishings els, are, about Ireland: As at Kilsale, Cork, Carlingford, Saltesses, Dungar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen: Yowghall, Waterford, La foy, The Band, Calibeg. &amp;c.

            <p>And, as for Ireland Fishings, some Towardnes of good Pollicy, and somwhat like reason of prouidence, was in the heds of the honorable Counsailors and Parlement Senators to King Edward the fowrth: When, in the fifth yere of his Raigne, this Act, (among sundry other,) was esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished: That no Ship, or other vessell, of any forreyn Cuntry, shall go to Fishing in the Irish Cuntryes: And, for Custome to be payd, of the vessell that commeth from forreyn Landes to Fishing.

And though, then, not Meat-able, for Man, when they are so destroyed: yet, within short tyme after, they wold be. And likewise, though, not then, likely to amount, in the whole Quantity, yerely, to so many loads: Yet, at the tyme of their being Market-able (of the Myddle <note n="*" place="margin">This Phrase, of Myddle-Sort Markat-able, is to be vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, neither of them which hard and scant are to be iudged Markat-able: Nor of the ouer growen Fish, and in the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perlatiue Growth (as a Man might term them,) But only of them, which, most commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diously are Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisable: in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of Profit Publik.</note> sort) they wold euidently appere, so, to be rated: or rather, far aboue. And neither, any more Charges, nor yet any greater trauaile of Man, is to be employed, for the same sorts of Fish hauing and enioying: both, when they wold be (as is sayd) Markat-able: And also, when the foresayd great haboundance of Vit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayles, by them, might be enioyed: Than is, when, so abhominably, they are destroyed, and vtterly spoyled.</p>
            <p>And, that this brief, and very needfull Aduertisement, may be found the more manifestly true, and duly geuen: You may vnderstand, That, in the Riuer of Thames only (as my Instructor, by Worshipfull Ien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, and other Men of experience, heretofore hath tryed out) most commonly, euery yere, by the Fishermen belonging to some one small Town (or within a little Circuit about it,) there is destroyed, aboue a Thousand Busshels, of the yong Fry, of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers kindes of good Fish: which, in due tyme of their growth, and by lawfull order, being taken, wold haue byn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

What is, then, (I pray you) to be rekened, of the Publik Dammage, of 500. Cart loads, of Fish, (yerely) thus destroyed? How may it (reasonably) any longer, remayn vnreformed? Which 500, Cartload, (according to the former Rate of Myddle Markat-able Fish,) do amount and ryse, of only 2400 Bushels of Fry, yerely destroyed.</p>
            <p>But, yf you suppose to be only 30 Trink-Boats: and that euery one of the sayd 30 Trink-Boat Nets, euery day, only for 300, dayes, in euery whole yere, destroy, but one Bushell of very small Fry: The Somme therof, doth amount to Nyne Thousand Bushels of Fry, so de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, yerely. Which Fry, when it should be Myddle Markat-able, wold be, (one with an other) of Ten tymes more Meat and Fish, than, when, it is so destroyed. Therefore, the Crafts-men of the Trink-Boats, on the Thames, may, very probably, be accused, conuicted, iudged, and condemned, as the most abhominable yerely Destructioners of Nynety Thousand Bushels of Markat-able Fish.</p>
            <p>And, if you abridge me, in the number of the dayes of their Labor, yerely: I will, then, charge eche of their Nets, with destroying dayly, more, than a Bushell of Fry: one day, with an other, euery day of their Labor. And I know (notwithstanding,) how much, I kepe me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my Bounds, yet: How Horrible and Intollerable, so euer, this Fact, doth sound in your eares: who haue not listened to this matter, before now: nor know the Verity therof, yet.</p>
            <p>Of this Nynety Thousand Bushels of Fish, if you will account but euery 48 Bushels, (which make six Quarters,) to be a Cart loade: the Somme will be 1875 Cart loads, of fresh Fish: which is destroyed, yere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by the Trink-Nets, only: And that, in the Noble Riuer of Thames, only. Whereby, it is most euident, that my first Assertion, of 500 Cart Loads of fresh Fish, destroyed, in the whole Realm of England, is most vndoutedly true.</p>

            <p>But, to Conclude this necessary Digression, withall: I may, aptly enough (and omitting many other,) Note only two manners of Hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances: Which, (easily, and most quickly) may be redressed: The one, is, of long tyme vsed, and (I know not, why,) permitted: and yet (notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing) is a great Hindrance and cause of Destruction, to the Western store of diuers kyndes of good Fishes. I mean, aboue London Bridge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>And that is, the Fishing with any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Net, in the places, which either for a Season, or in the other, which are continually exempted from being Fished in, (commonly called Seueralls, and Rough places.)</q>
In which places, what vnlawfull, or vndue Subtlery is vsed, to auoyd the Roughs, and Stakes, for feare of hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or renting of their Nets, (and yet, to beat, and punch the Beds, or Skulls of Fish: and by [in manner] thundring s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But, with all men, of sufficient Iudgement (in many Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects,) it may be condemned, as a great hyndrance to the Broode and Store preseruing: and a violent breaking, of the first Intent of the Politik Ciuill Senators: who, made the Ordonances, for such Places Seueralling, or vtterly Exempting, and reseruing vnransakt, and vndisturbed. And though Peter-Men, will make great shew of good Argument, to the Contrary: yet, it is best, to make sure woork: in Circumspectly establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing the Priuilege, and exemption of those peculiarly assigned, and well known places, of Store and Broode: from any manner of Net casting in the same, or any artificiall disturbance, purposely, therin to be vsed, for any Fish taking.</p>
            <p>The Second Hyndrance, is the Stinching, Soyling, (or, rather Beslouening,) of the Thames: Both Shores, and Channels: Where, the yerely Recours, and far more Plentifull Haunt, than now is, of the Western <note n="*" place="margin">The Seasonable Repayr, of the Western Smelt, is a matter of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: Both, for the very who<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
