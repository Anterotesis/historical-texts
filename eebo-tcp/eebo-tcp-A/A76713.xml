            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Bill Read to Compel the Creditors of Bankrupts to Accept of ſuch a Compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as the Major Part of the Creditors ſhall agree to, and Ordered a Second Reading.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>
                  <add>28 Junij Read a 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> time &amp; Com<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>itted</add>
               </p>
            </argument>
            <p>IF ſuch a Bill paſs, It will abſolutely diſcourage all Publick Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce. And incourage Cheating. For the Bankrupts, either by means of Friends and Relations, or by pretended Debts, or by private Contrivances with ſome of the Creditors, will find out ways to Act Villany at pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Vyner</hi> in <hi>June,</hi> 1685, got a Bill brought in to the ſame effect as this Bill is, which was Read a Second time and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and the Committee were pleaſed to ſtop it.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Robert Vyner</hi> and his Son are both ſince Dead, and Sir <hi>Robert</hi>'s Executor is ſuppoſed to be concerned in bringing in this Bill. But if any ſuch Bill is paſſed, It is Humbly Prayed, that the Concerns of Sir <hi>Robert</hi> may be excepted, for Sir <hi>Robert</hi> was a great Gainer by the late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, and not a Looſer as he pretended, and Sir <hi>Robert</hi> Died poſſeſſed of a great Eſtate, although by his Will he hath given but 30 l. <hi>per Cent</hi> of the Principal to his Creditors in Money, and the remaining Principal and Intereſt to be taken by Aſſignment in the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> And the reſt of his Eſtate he hath given amongſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his Relations and Hoſpitals. But the Creditors are in hopes of being preferred before ſuch Legacies, there being a ſufficient Eſtate left to Pay them which have Signed the Propoſals their Compoſition. And to the other Creditors their whole Debts, and many of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors having Judgments, and ſome having already extended his Lands. And if the Executor did not deſign to make great Advantage to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he would not Attempt theſe things, any Perſon being a fitter Truſtee for the Creditors then he.</p>
