            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN so many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Treatises</hi> have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready appear'd on this <hi>Subject,</hi> it may well be wonder'd why, after all, so <hi>mean a Pen</hi> should attempt so <hi>weighty</hi> an <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> since 'tis almost impossible to say any thing <hi>New</hi> upon it, and the mildest <hi>Question</hi> a Man must expect, who now handles it, would be of the same <hi>Nature</hi> with that of <hi>Iob</hi> to his Friends; <hi>Who knoweth not such</hi>

               <hi>Things as these?</hi> But one that is <hi>resolved</hi> to write a <hi>Book,</hi> seldom wants an <hi>Excuse</hi> for doing it, and will be ready to draw one, even
<pb facs="tcp:106561:4"/>
from the <hi>Number</hi> of those which have gone before him, since this might have hinder'd <hi>others</hi> as well as <hi>him:</hi> And besides, there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Size</hi> of <hi>Writers,</hi> suitable to the different <hi>Capacities</hi> of <hi>Readers;</hi> and <hi>Acquaintance,</hi> or <hi>Inclination,</hi> or sometimes pure <hi>Accident,</hi> may be the occasion of some <hi>Persons</hi> reading <hi>one</hi> Book, when they would not have read <hi>another,</hi> and perhaps, to <hi>Profit</hi> more by it, than they might by another <hi>better</hi> written on the same <hi>Subject.</hi> What I have aim'd at in this <hi>Manual,</hi> is to be as <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>methodical</hi> as I could, both in the <hi>Description</hi> of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion</hi> and <hi>Ends</hi> of its <hi>Institution,</hi> and in the <hi>Directions</hi> for our <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour</hi> in relation to the <hi>Reception</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106561:4"/>
of it. I have endeavour'd to give a <hi>rational</hi> and <hi>distinct View</hi> of it in all the <hi>Notions,</hi> wherein <hi>Learned</hi> and <hi>Pious Men</hi> have <hi>repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented</hi> it: To press home the <hi>indispensible,</hi> tho' much <hi>neglected Duty</hi> of <hi>frequent Communion,</hi> which I am persuaded would highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to a <hi>general Reformation</hi> of <hi>Manners,</hi> and to <hi>repair</hi> the <hi>Decays</hi> of <hi>Christian Piety</hi> amongst us. To lay down some <hi>plain Rules</hi> for our <hi>Preparation,</hi> and <hi>Heads</hi> of <hi>Examination,</hi> in order to our <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Receiving,</hi> with <hi>Meditations</hi> or <hi>Prayers</hi> suited to every <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Office,</hi> and inserted in their <hi>proper Places.</hi> As to the <hi>double Appendix,</hi> the <hi>former</hi> relating to our <hi>Religious Societies,</hi> whose <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Orders</hi> have been <hi>published</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106561:5"/>
and <hi>defended</hi> by Mr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> in his late <hi>Book</hi> on that <hi>Subject;</hi> and my Lord Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> in the <hi>Life</hi> of Dr. <hi>Horneck,</hi> and for whom, Her late Majesty of Blessed Memory was so much concerned while She was living; their whole <hi>Design</hi> appeared to me so highly serviceable to <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> that I could not but take this <hi>Opportunity</hi> to <hi>recommend</hi> it, and shall still be of the same <hi>mind,</hi> till I can see, what I have here offered on that <hi>Head,</hi> fairly answered. And the <hi>latter,</hi> which relates to <hi>Baptism,</hi> will be granted not <hi>unnecessary,</hi> when several (I hope) well-meaning <hi>Persons,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially in <hi>those Parts</hi> where I <hi>live,</hi> are <hi>unsatisfied</hi> about it: And 'tis the same which has been done
<pb facs="tcp:106561:5"/>
before by the Right Reverend and Pious Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> in his <hi>Aqua Genitalis,</hi> after his <hi>Mensa Mystica;</hi> and by others who have <hi>laboured</hi> on the same <hi>Subject.</hi> Likewise, I have added the <hi>Great Hallel,</hi> or <hi>Paschal Hymn,</hi> which was usually sung by the <hi>Iews</hi> at their <hi>Passover,</hi> and by our <hi>Saviour</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> at the <hi>Institution</hi> of this <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Nor am I unwilling to <hi>own</hi> that I have thro' the whole, wrought in any <hi>memorable Thoughts</hi> which I have met with in such <hi>Authors,</hi> as have handled the <hi>same Argument;</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving done all as <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendiously</hi> as I was able. To conclude; if the <hi>whole,</hi> or any <hi>Part</hi> of this <hi>little Book,</hi> may any ways tend to promote the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> or the <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:106561:6"/>
of <hi>Mankind,</hi> especially of that <hi>dear Flock,</hi> over which it has plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <hi>God</hi> to give me <hi>Charge,</hi> I shall not much regret my <hi>Composing,</hi> and <hi>Adventuring</hi> it abroad into the <hi>World.</hi>

               <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Of the</hi> Nature <hi>of the</hi> Sacrament.</head>
               <p>§ I. THE <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> may be thus described. <q>'Tis a Memorial, and Representation of the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Death of Christ, instituted by Christ himself in the room of the Jewish Passover; wherein, by the <hi>breaking</hi> of <hi>Bread,</hi> and drinking of Wine, we <hi>renew</hi> our <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with God, <hi>praising</hi> him for all his <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and testify our <hi>Union</hi> with all good Men; and whereby the <hi>Benefits</hi> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's <hi>Death</hi> are <hi>sealed</hi> and <hi>applyed</hi> to every faithful <hi>Receiver.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>§. II. ['Tis a <hi>Memorial</hi> of the Sacrifice of the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ.] I confess, the whole Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Action has been stiled by the <hi>Fathers,</hi> as well as by some Excellent Persons of our own Church, the <hi>Christian Sacrifice,</hi> the <hi>unbloody Sacrifice;</hi> and is indeed such, in the <hi>same Sense</hi> that <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praise,</hi> whereof it is in a great measure compos'd, are <hi>styled</hi> under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:106561:9"/>
                  <hi>spiritual Sacrifices:</hi> Nay, it comes yet nearer to the <hi>Nature</hi> of the old <hi>Eucharistical,</hi> and other <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> because 'tis an <hi>Oblation</hi> of something <hi>visible,</hi> namely, <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> to be <hi>consum'd</hi> to God's <hi>Honor;</hi> which are then <hi>offer'd</hi> when the Minister places them on the Christian Altar, or <hi>Holy Table;</hi> (as was done more solemnly by <hi>lifting</hi> them up in the antient Church) immediately after which, in the <hi>Prayer</hi> for the <hi>Church Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant,</hi> he beseeches God to receive our <hi>Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> (as well as <hi>Alms</hi> and <hi>Prayers);</hi> which may relate to the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> newly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered: But since it has no <hi>shedding of Blood</hi> therein, which has been thought essential to a <hi>proper Sacrifice</hi>

                     </gap>, <hi>macto: &amp; facio,</hi> is used in the same Sense.</note>, and that the <hi>shedding</hi> of our Saviour's <hi>Blood,</hi> is only <hi>Sacramentally represented</hi> in it, and not <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually</hi> and <hi>properly poured</hi> forth, as it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Cross,</hi> whereon he was <hi>once offered,</hi> to take away Sin; and since the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is a <hi>Memorial</hi> of that <hi>one Oblation</hi> of Christ, and 'tis contrary to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a <hi>Memorial</hi> or <hi>Remembrance of the Sacrifice of the Death of Christ,</hi> to be the <hi>same</hi> with that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> it remembers; for these Reasons we cannot own any such
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:106561:9"/>
                  <hi>proper, propitiatory, attoning Sacrifice</hi>

                     <hi>Homily</hi> of the Sacrament, <hi>Part</hi> 1. We must take heed lest of the <hi>Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> it be made a <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice,</hi> exactly as <hi>Eusebius,</hi> who says our Saviour left us, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</note> in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the <hi>Romanists</hi> do believe, any more than we can think with them, that 'tis <hi>available</hi> both for <hi>quick</hi> and <hi>dead;</hi> of neither of which we find any <hi>Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steps</hi> in the Holy Scriptures. Suffice it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that we believe it a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in the highest Sense, that <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praise</hi> are so call'd in the New Testament, because it requires, and is compos'd of the most <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Acts</hi> of both; that we believe it an <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,</hi> or <hi>Dedication</hi> of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> to the <hi>sacred</hi> use, as well as we therein <hi>offer</hi> our <hi>selves</hi> anew to God; and that we believe the whole <hi>Action,</hi> a <hi>Memorial,</hi> a <hi>Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and <hi>Representation</hi> of the inestima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Death</hi> of Christ, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alone we expect <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ III. First, 'Tis a <hi>'[Memorial</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration</hi> of Christ's Death, and of the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> which he thereby offer'd for us.] That is, by this <hi>sacred Action,</hi> we <hi>record,</hi> and keep it in <hi>mind,</hi> till he come again to <hi>Iudgment.</hi> And that according to his own
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:106561:10"/>
                  <hi>Command,</hi> as St. <hi>Luke</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>St.</hi> Luk. 22. 19. 1 Cor. 11. 24, 25.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates it of the <hi>Bread,</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> both of the <hi>Bread</hi> and Wine; <hi>This do in remembrance of me.</hi> As <hi>forgetfulness</hi> of God's Goodness and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude</hi> for it, must needs have been great occasions of the <hi>fall</hi> of Man, so that very <hi>fall</hi> renders us still more <hi>forgetful</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful. Mankind</hi> will therefore have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways need enough of <hi>Helps</hi> to their <hi>Memory</hi> in <hi>religious Matters:</hi> And some of these, God has appointed wherever there has been a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Religion.</hi> Thus the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of the <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sover</hi> was instituted for a <hi>Remembrance</hi> of what the <hi>Israelites suffered</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and of God's wonderful Mercy in delivering them from it, as well as to <hi>typify</hi> or <hi>shadow</hi> forth unto them <hi>Christ</hi> himself, our <hi>great Passover.</hi> The <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the Lord's Supper was in like manner instituted; That we might <hi>keep in memory</hi> that which Christ <hi>suffered</hi> for us, and <hi>delivered</hi> to us; such a <hi>sensible Sign,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable <hi>solemn Action,</hi> being much more likely to preserve a lively <hi>impression</hi> of it, than if it had been only barely <hi>recorded</hi> in History. Now this <hi>Commemoration</hi> may be considered either with respect to <hi>our selves,</hi> or with respect to <hi>God:</hi> as it respects our selves, we not only therein <hi>commemorate</hi> God's
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:106561:10"/>
                  <hi>Love</hi> in general to <hi>Mankind,</hi> in giving his <hi>Son,</hi> and our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s Love, in giving him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self a <hi>Ransom</hi> for all Men, to bring them into a <hi>Capacity</hi> of Salvation on their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Obedience;</hi> but yet farther, the <hi>actual Application</hi> of his meritorious <hi>Sacrifice</hi> to our selves, on our performing the <hi>Conditions</hi> of his <hi>Covenant,</hi> and his infinite <hi>Goodness</hi> in making us partakers of his Holy <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and thereby <hi>calling</hi> us to this <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Salvation,</hi> and <hi>preserving</hi> us in it. As this <hi>Commemoration</hi> relates to <hi>God,</hi> we do also, in the <hi>Communion,</hi> present a <hi>Memorial</hi> of a <hi>sweet Savour</hi> before him, and beseech him for the sake of his <hi>dear</hi> Son, and by his <hi>Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies,</hi> and bloody <hi>Sweat,</hi> by his <hi>Cross,</hi> and <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> and precious <hi>Death,</hi> to have <hi>Mercy</hi> upon us, and grant us the <hi>Remission</hi> of our <hi>Sins,</hi> and all other <hi>Benefits</hi> of his Sufferings. Not that God is either <hi>ignorant</hi> of our <hi>Wants,</hi> or <hi>unwilling</hi> to <hi>relieve</hi> us, or <hi>forgetful</hi> of us: But we must be <hi>sensible</hi> of these things our selves, and of God's <hi>Power</hi> to help us, and seek for <hi>Relief</hi> in those ways he has appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. And well may we more solemnly <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate</hi> our Saviour's <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in this <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,</hi> when we do the same in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, even in our <hi>daily Prayers,</hi> and ask all for his <hi>sake,</hi> and in a Sense, <hi>offer</hi> him <hi>anew</hi> to his Father, applying his <hi>Attonement,</hi> and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:106561:11"/>
pleading his <hi>Merits,</hi> and trusting in his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession</hi> and <hi>Meditation.</hi> Nor ought we to forget that the antient <hi>Liturgies,</hi> did not only <hi>commemorate</hi> our Saviour's Death in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, but likewise his <hi>Resurrection</hi> and <hi>Ascention into</hi> Heaven.</p>
               <p>§ IV. Secondly. But there is not only a <hi>Commemoration,</hi> but a <hi>Representation</hi> too of our Saviour's Death, in the <hi>Holy Communion.</hi> 'Tis not a <hi>bare Remembrance</hi> of it, 'tis a lively <hi>Scheme</hi> and <hi>Figure</hi> of what he endur'd: <q>As oft as ye <hi>eat</hi> of this <hi>Bread,</hi> and drink of this Cup,</q> says the Apostle, ye do <hi>shew forth,</hi> or rather, by way of Command, <hi>shew ye forth,</hi> the Lord's Death till he come. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare</hi> it, proclaim it, <q>tell the People what great things he has done!</q> Whence this <hi>Representation</hi> of Christ's Death in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> has a respect to <hi>others</hi> to whom we are to <hi>declare</hi> it, as well as it relates, like the <hi>Commemoration</hi> before-mention'd, to <hi>our selves</hi> and to <hi>God.</hi> We do by this <hi>proclaim</hi> unto <hi>Men</hi> and Angels, the <hi>manifold Wisdom</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> of God, and the Kindness and <hi>Condescention</hi> of our ever blessed Redeemer; and in a manner <hi>preach</hi> the <hi>Gospel to every Creature,</hi> while we here <hi>represent</hi> so consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable a part of it, as our Saviour's <hi>Death,</hi> and own that we are not <hi>asham'd</hi> of his <hi>Cross,</hi> but rather <hi>Glory</hi> in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:106561:11"/>
§ V. We <hi>represent</hi> it also to <hi>our selves:</hi> that is, we do by this sacred significant, and lively <hi>Action,</hi> fix it more <hi>deeply</hi> in our <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> and <hi>Memories.</hi> The <hi>Bread represents</hi> our Saviour's <hi>Body,</hi> who is the <hi>true Bread of Life</hi> that came down from <hi>Heaven:</hi> The <hi>Wine,</hi> his <hi>Blood:</hi> The <hi>Breaking</hi> of the <hi>Bread,</hi> the <hi>Torments</hi> he endur'd on the <hi>Cross,</hi> and the <hi>Wounding</hi> of his <hi>sacred Body;</hi> as the <hi>pouring</hi> out of the <hi>Wine</hi> is a most lively <hi>Figure</hi> of the <hi>shedding</hi> his most precious <hi>Blood.</hi> But of this, more hereafter.</p>
               <p>§ VI. But in the last place, we also <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present</hi> our Saviour's <hi>Death,</hi> to <hi>God</hi> the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> in the <hi>Holy Communion:</hi> This we do by those <hi>Actions</hi> which he himself has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, as <hi>means</hi> of supplicating him, and obtaining his Favour: <q>Beseeching our heavenly Father, who of his tender Mercy, did give his only Son Jesus Christ to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer <hi>Death</hi> upon the Cross for our Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that we duly receiving the <hi>Holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries,</hi> according to our Lord Jesus Christ's Holy Institution, in <hi>remembrance</hi> of his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Passion,</hi> may be <hi>Partakers</hi> of his most blessed <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood.</hi>
                  </q> The Priest neither <hi>makes</hi> nor <hi>offers</hi> the real <hi>natural Body</hi> of Christ, in the <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> but
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:106561:12"/>
he makes his <hi>spiritual</hi> or <hi>sacramental</hi> Body, and therein <hi>represents</hi> his <hi>natural</hi> Body as well as he also represents what he really <hi>suffer'd</hi> for us, in the <hi>verity</hi> of that <hi>Body;</hi> this he <hi>represents</hi> to <hi>God</hi> as well as to <hi>us,</hi> and every <hi>devout Communicant</hi> should faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully joyn in the <hi>Representation:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ VII. The next thing observable in our Description of the <hi>Holy Communion</hi> is, [That 'twas instituted by Christ in the room of the <hi>Iewish Passover:]</hi> This as it gives great <hi>Light</hi> into the Nature of it, and the most weighty <hi>Controversies</hi> concerning it, so the <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> it self, is too evident to be doubted or denied, and of too great <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> to be lightly pass'd over: As will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear if we consider the <hi>Time,</hi> the <hi>Form,</hi> the <hi>End</hi> of the Institution of this Sacrament, compared with that of the Passover, and the Expressions of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> and the Apostles, relating to the <hi>Communion</hi> it self, or to our <hi>Saviour,</hi> who ordained it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Time</hi> of its first Institution and <hi>Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration,</hi> was the Night of the <hi>Paschal Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> immediately <hi>after</hi> Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. We are told by <note n="*" place="margin">Buxtorf. Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. <hi>p.</hi> 302. de Paschat cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brando.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:106561:12"/>
the <hi>Messias</hi> should come to <hi>redeem</hi> them the very <hi>same Night</hi> in which God brought them out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> the <hi>Night</hi> of the <hi>Passover,</hi> whereon they also say that God vouchsafed to the old Patriarchs and holy Men, most, or all of those famous <hi>Blessings</hi> and <hi>Delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances</hi> which we read of in the <hi>sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings;</hi> which is no obscure <hi>Indication,</hi> that the <hi>Sacrament</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> was to succeed the <hi>Paschal Supper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ VIII. The <hi>manner</hi> of their celebrating the <hi>Passover</hi> also proves the same; For the <hi>Master of the House,</hi> 
                  <q>took <hi>Bread,</hi> and brake it, and gave it to those about him, and said, <hi>This is the Bread of affliction which our Fathers did eat in Egypt.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Buxtorf. ubi supra.</note> that is, the <hi>Memorial</hi> of that Bread, in the same Sense that our Saviour said, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> after he had taken <hi>Bread,</hi> and blessed and brake it, and gave to his Disciples, as the <hi>Iews</hi> also call'd the Passover, <q>The <hi>Body</hi> of the <hi>Paschal Lamb.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>And in like manner, the <hi>Cap.</hi> The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster</hi> of the <hi>Feast</hi> took it <hi>after Supper,</hi> and when he had given <hi>Thanks,</hi> gave it to the rest, and said, <q>This is the <hi>Fruit</hi> of the <hi>Vine,</hi> and the <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>Grape.</hi>
                  </q> This was the <hi>third Cup</hi> which they drank at the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:106561:13"/>
Passover, and call'd it, The <hi>Cup of Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</hi>

                  <hi>This is the Blood of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant which God made with you;</hi> it was not only the <hi>Seal</hi> of the New Covenant, but likewise the <hi>Sanction</hi> of it: And 'tis remarkable that our Saviour calls it the <hi>Fruit</hi> of the <hi>Vine,</hi> as did the Master of the Feast at the Passover. And so the Apostle calls the <hi>Sacramental Cup,</hi> the <hi>Cup</hi> of <hi>Blessing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ IX. There's yet another thing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in the <hi>Passover,</hi> which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our <hi>retain'd</hi> in his <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and that is the <hi>Hymn,</hi> or <hi>great Hallel,</hi> which the <hi>Iews</hi> always <hi>sung</hi> at this <hi>Festival,</hi> and still con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to use it in that <hi>shadow</hi> of the <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sover</hi>

§ XI. Lastly, There are several Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions in the New Testament which will not suffer us to doubt of the <hi>Analogy</hi> between them. Thus the Baptist calls our Saviour, <hi>The Lamb of God</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">St. <hi>Ioh.</hi> 1. 29.</note>; and St. <hi>Peter</hi> says, <q>That we were not redeemed with corruptible things, but with the precious Blood of Christ, as of a <hi>Lamb</hi> without <hi>Blemish</hi>

               <p>From all which it appears, that the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> of the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> was instituted in the room of the <hi>Passover,</hi> and that our Saviour retained many of the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> therein, as well such as God himself had immediately <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Cudworth,</hi> and Discourse of the Holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, <hi>p.</hi> 6.</note>

Yet, he goes on, 'We say not that the <hi>Substance</hi> of <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine</hi> is done away, or that Christ's <hi>Body</hi> is <hi>fleshly</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in the Sacrament, but we lift up our <hi>hearts</hi> to <hi>Heaven,</hi> there to <hi>feed</hi> on him.</q> Tho', by the way, What need would there have been of the <hi>Sursum Corda,</hi> or Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the People in the Primitive Church, to lift up their <hi>Hearts</hi> to <hi>Christ</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> if <hi>whole Christ, God and Man,</hi> were actually <hi>present</hi> upon the <hi>Altar?</hi>

of the Lord, therefore surely they did not properly <hi>communicate</hi> of his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> which he that does has eternal Life; nay, they did <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> their own <hi>Iudgment</hi> or <hi>Condemnation,</hi> not <hi>discerning</hi> the <hi>Lords Body.</hi> And to the same purpose is that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous saying of one of the Fathers, <q>That the Wicked do only <hi>press</hi> with their <hi>Teeth</hi> the <hi>Sacrament</hi> or <hi>outward Sign</hi> of the <hi>Lords Body,</hi> but do not really <hi>communicate</hi> in it.</q> Neither did the <hi>Fathers</hi> ever think that we were to <hi>eat</hi> the <hi>Flesh</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> in a gross carnal, <hi>Capernaitical</hi> sense, whatever <hi>high Expressions</hi> they may have sometime used concerning this <hi>Mystery,</hi> wherein they may have been followed by devout <hi>modern Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> Hear one for all: 'Tis St. <hi>Augustine, de Doctrinâ Christianâ, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 16. where, in his Rules for interpreting Scripture, he instances in that Text, which has been so much controverted of late years, the <hi>6th</hi> of St. <hi>Iohn Ver.</hi> 53. <q>Except ye <hi>eat</hi> the <hi>Flesh</hi> of the <hi>Son</hi> of Man and <hi>drink</hi> his <hi>Blood,</hi> ye have no <hi>Life</hi> in you: <hi>Si praeceptiva locutio, &amp;c.</hi> If, says he, the Expression <hi>forbid</hi> any <hi>wicked action,</hi> or <hi>command</hi> a <hi>good</hi> one, then 'tis not <hi>figurative;</hi> but if it appears to <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> any <hi>Wickedness,</hi> or <hi>forbid</hi> any <hi>Good,</hi> it must be <hi>figurative.</hi> Thus he goes on, that expression, <q>Except ye <hi>eat</hi> the <hi>Flesh</hi>

               <p>§ XVII. But if <hi>Christ</hi> be no otherwise in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> than <hi>figuratively</hi> in the <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols,</hi> as they are a <hi>Commemoration</hi> of his death, and <hi>spiritually</hi> and <hi>effectually</hi> present to the faithful <hi>Reeeiver;</hi> Where is then, it may be asked, the <hi>Mystery,</hi> which all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge in this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and which is so often called by ancient Writers, the <hi>ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable,</hi> the <hi>awful</hi> and the <hi>tremendous Mystery</hi> or <hi>Mysteries</hi> of our <hi>Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In answer, We do own, that as in general <hi>great is the Mystery of Godliness;</hi> so there is something, which far transcends our <hi>Reason,</hi> in this Sacrament, and in the <hi>manner</hi> of our Saviours <hi>acting</hi> on our <hi>minds</hi> therein, though the <hi>Fact</hi> it self be clearly revealed in Scripture.

and <hi>Blood</hi> of Christ: How the inestimable Benefits of <hi>Christs Death</hi> are <hi>communicated</hi> to us by the <hi>reception</hi> of the <hi>humble</hi> Signs; how we are thereby <hi>united</hi> to him, and he to us: this, as the Apostle says, perhaps on the <hi>same occasion,</hi> is indeed a <hi>great Mystery,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Ephes. 5. 32.</note> and we can no more give an <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</hi> thereof than we can of 'the <hi>Wind</hi> which 'bloweth where it listeth.

               <p>§ XVIII. By the <hi>eating</hi> this <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> this <hi>Wine,</hi> continuing thus in their proper substances, tho' <hi>Grace</hi> is added to them by their being <hi>taken</hi> and <hi>blessed,</hi> or set apart to this <hi>sacred</hi> use, we do most solemnly and <hi>Sacramentally [renew</hi> our <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>God.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God made a <hi>Covenant</hi> in Paradice with all Mankind in our <hi>first Parents,</hi> which was called, <hi>The First Covenant,</hi> the <hi>Condition</hi> whereof was, <hi>Do this and live;</hi> the <hi>Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>

                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:106561:22"/>
or a <hi>Token, Pledge</hi> or <hi>instituted Sign</hi> of our being actually in <hi>Covenant</hi> with God; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which what <hi>right</hi> had we to <hi>approach</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, or how could we expect any <hi>Mercy</hi> from him?</p>
               <p>§ XXI. Let us consider the <hi>Holy Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> as a <hi>Feast,</hi> a sacred <hi>Feast,</hi> which was used among the <hi>Ancients</hi> at the <hi>Confirmation</hi> of <hi>Covenants,</hi> in token of <hi>Amity</hi> and <hi>Friendship</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Guests.</hi> Thus in that noted Instance, at the ratifying the <hi>League</hi> between <hi>Isaac</hi> and <hi>Abimelech,</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Isaac</hi> made a <hi>Feast,</hi> and they did <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> and <hi>sware</hi> one to another.</q> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Gen. 26. 30.</note> But this was more than an <hi>ordinary Feast,</hi> there was generally a <hi>Sacrifice</hi> added to it, at which they believed God himself <hi>present,</hi> a <hi>Partaker</hi> thereof, and a <hi>Witness</hi> of their Agreement. Thus when <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Laban</hi> made a <hi>Covenant,</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>Iacob</hi> offered <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> upon the Mount, and called his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren to <hi>eat Bread.</hi> Gen. 29 54.</q> And the Passover was both a <hi>Feast</hi> and a <hi>Sacrifice:</hi> and 'tis the Character which God himself gives of his <hi>Saints,</hi> or those that were relatively or <hi>federally</hi> holy, that they had made a <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him with Sacrifice, Psal.</hi> 50. 5. And the Apostle speaking, as 'tis very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, of this Christian Banquet the <hi>Holy
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:106561:22"/>
Communion</hi> which comes in the room of the <hi>Passover,</hi> exhorts the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to <hi>keep</hi> the <hi>Feast</hi> not with <hi>old Leaven, &amp;c.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 7. 8.</note> Thus 'tis called <hi>the Table of the</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. 10. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Lord:</hi> and the <hi>Wine, the Cup of the Lord.</hi> And God vouchsafes therein to come in unto us, and <hi>sup</hi> with us; nay to kill the <hi>fatted Calf</hi> for us, and feast us with his own <hi>Sacramental Body</hi> and <hi>Blood;</hi> and thereby assures us of his <hi>Favour</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> to us, and renews his <hi>Covenant</hi> with us, and gives us leave to do the <hi>same</hi> with him.</p>
               <p>§ XXII. But we <hi>confirm</hi> this <hi>Covenant</hi> by a most solemn <hi>Oath,</hi> as well as a <hi>Feast,</hi> in this <hi>Holy Communion;</hi> for it partakes of both. The very Word <hi>Sacrament</hi> originally signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that <hi>Military Oath</hi> which Soldiers took to their <hi>General,</hi> to bear <hi>Faith</hi> and true <hi>Allegiance</hi> to him, to <hi>obey</hi> his <hi>Commands.</hi> In the <hi>Lords Supper</hi> we swear <hi>Fealty</hi> and <hi>Homage</hi> to the great King of Earth and Heaven; and, as well as in <hi>Baptism,</hi> engage to be his <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Servants and Soldiers to our Lives end.</hi> Which <hi>Oath,</hi> as all others, does imply an <hi>Imprecation,</hi> as did the ancient <hi>Sacrifices</hi> used at the <hi>Ratification</hi> of <hi>Leagues,</hi> wherein the <hi>Beast</hi> being cut in pieces, the <hi>Parties agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing went</hi> between them, wishing that their
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:106561:23"/>
                  <hi>Blood</hi> might be so <hi>poured</hi> out, and they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves <hi>cut</hi> in pieces, if they ever brake their <hi>Vow</hi> and <hi>Covenant.</hi> To which the <hi>breaking</hi> of the <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>pouring</hi> out of the <hi>Wine</hi> does answer in the <hi>Communion:</hi> as it may farther signifie, that we resolve to be <hi>faithful</hi> even to the <hi>Death,</hi> to our great Lord and Master; and if there be occasion are ready to <hi>shed</hi> our <hi>Blood</hi> for him, as he did for us. The <hi>Commemoration</hi> whereof is indeed the main <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal <hi>Notion</hi> wherein we are to represent it to our <hi>Minds;</hi> but there are <hi>subordinate Ends</hi> and other <hi>useful Notions,</hi> under which we may <hi>consider</hi> it, in order to <hi>profit</hi> by it.

Hitherto we have for the most part discoursed of what <hi>we our selves</hi> are to <hi>do</hi> in the <hi>Reception</hi> of the <hi>Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> To <hi>commemorate</hi> and <hi>represent</hi> the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> of our Saviours Death, according to his <hi>Institution,</hi> by eating of <hi>Bread</hi> and drinking of <hi>Wine;</hi> therein <hi>renewing</hi> our <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>God, praising</hi> him for his Goodness, and testifying and exercising our
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:106561:25"/>
                  <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> towards all our <hi>Christian Brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XXVI. I proceed, in the last place, to that which we are to <hi>receive</hi> from God in the conscientious discharge of our Duty, and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Reception</hi> of this <hi>Holy Communion:</hi> Which is contained in the last part of our Descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, [That thereby all the <hi>Benefits</hi> of our <hi>Saviour's Death</hi> are <hi>sealed</hi> and applyed to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>faithful Receiver.]</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XXVII. The Sacraments are <hi>Seals</hi> of God's Covenant with us. The Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly affirms it of <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision,</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 4. 11. Galat. 3. 14.</note> as it was a Sign of the <hi>Evangelical Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and all his <hi>faithful Children,</hi> that is, all that should <hi>believe in God</hi> as he did. In the room whereof <hi>Baptism</hi> was introduced by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour as <hi>another Seal</hi> of the <hi>same Covenant,</hi> and means our <hi>Initiation</hi> into it: And <hi>one</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament being a <hi>Seal,</hi> it follows by <hi>parity of Reason</hi> that the <hi>other</hi> must be so also. The <hi>Holy Symbols,</hi> when duly received, do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit and convey unto us divine <hi>Virtue</hi> and assistance, and all the inestimable <hi>Benefits</hi> which were purchas'd for us, and reached out unto us by the Death of a Redeemer; as Justification or <hi>actual Pardon</hi> of our Sins,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:106561:25"/>
the reinstating us in God's Favour, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suring us that he is <hi>reconciled</hi> to us, and that we are accounted righteous before him; as well as <hi>Sanctification,</hi> or actual Strength and Grace to conquer our <hi>Sins</hi> and to obey his <hi>Commands.</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>beginnings</hi> of these are conferred in <hi>Baptism;</hi> we are so far <hi>regenerate</hi> therein, as to be <hi>grafted into the Body of Christs Church,</hi> and to partake of its <hi>Privileges</hi> by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> within us, who will never be wanting to us or forsake us, unless we our selves do <hi>put a Bar</hi> to the <hi>Divine As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance</hi> by confirm'd ill <hi>Habits</hi> and by a <hi>wicked Life.</hi> But since the <hi>Divine Image,</hi> which we there recovered, is very often <hi>obscured</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by the Temptations of the <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> and the remains of <hi>Sin</hi> within us, there is need enough of our being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed again by <hi>Repentance;</hi> nor has God here left us without Hope or Comfort, but notwithstanding the Dream of the old <hi>Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> has appointed a Remedy even for those who <hi>sin</hi> after <hi>Baptism,</hi> and that is this <hi>other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of the Lord, wherein as we <hi>renew</hi> our <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, we receive new <hi>Strength</hi> to obey his <hi>Commands,</hi> as hath been the constant Faith of all <hi>good Christians</hi> in all Ages: we therein obtain not only the <hi>strengthning,</hi> but likewise the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshing</hi> of our Souls, as the Catechism ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presses
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:106561:26"/>
it, which includes <hi>Divine Consolation,</hi> and <hi>Ioy</hi> in <hi>believing,</hi> and such <hi>Peace</hi> as passes all <hi>Understanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XXVIII. But may some here object, Where is this <hi>Blessedness you speak of?</hi> Where are these <hi>Promises</hi> in Holy Scripture, of such wonderful <hi>assistance</hi> in this <hi>Sacrament?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In answer, This <hi>Holy Communion</hi> is the <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of all other <hi>Christian Duties,</hi> to which so many <hi>Blessings</hi> are promised throughout the whole Gospel (or else why do we <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> them?) of <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> and Thanksgiving, and Holy Vows, and Prayer, and Praise, and Confession, and Adoration; and consequently it must <hi>share</hi> in all their <hi>Blessings</hi> and <hi>Benefits.</hi> 'Tis a <hi>Memorial</hi> or <hi>Commemoration</hi> of our Saviour's <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Sufferings;</hi> and if God has promised in the <hi>old Law</hi> that in every place where there is a <hi>Memorial</hi> of his Name, he will meet and bless his People, <note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 20. 24.</note> much more may we expect it under the <hi>Gospel.</hi> If our Saviour has so solemnly promised, <q>that where two or three are <hi>gathered</hi> together in his Name,</q> there he will be in the midst of 'em and bless 'em, much more will he <hi>be</hi> so at this great <hi>Synaxis,</hi> this more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and solemn <hi>Assembly</hi> of Christians to

'Tis a <hi>big Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression</hi> [The <hi>Communion</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Christ:]</hi> 'tis surely far more than an <hi>empty Figure:</hi> 'Tis not a little matter to <hi>eat the Lords Supper,</hi> to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the <hi>Table</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> wherein if he that <hi>eats</hi> and <hi>drinks unworthily</hi> eats and drinks <hi>Damnation;</hi> surely he that does it <hi>worthily</hi> must eat and drink <hi>Salvation.</hi> No less can be intended in our <hi>Communion of Christ's Body and Blood,</hi> than the eternal Son of God's <hi>uniting</hi> himself by his <hi>Spirit</hi> to our <hi>Souls</hi> in this Holy Sacrament; and even by his own <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> whereby he in a sense, and in some <hi>degree,</hi> makes us <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers</hi> thereof; and communicates unto us all the <hi>Blessings</hi> he has obtained for us, by this Heavenly Food nourishing up our Souls to <hi>everlasting Life:</hi> Giving us herein

the <hi>Earnest</hi> and <hi>Pledge</hi> of our <hi>Immortality,</hi> as well as the <hi>means</hi> of it; and assuring us, that because he <hi>lives</hi> we shall <hi>live</hi> also; which is the meaning of those Expressions <q>

               <p>§ XXIX. Which brings to the close of our Description, that all these <hi>Benefits</hi> are conferred in the Sacrament, only on [the <hi>faithful Receiver.]</hi> For none but such are
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:106561:27"/>
properly <hi>Partakers</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of the Lord. If <hi>Iudas</hi> did outwardly partake of this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as our Church seems to have thought he did <note n="†" place="margin">

               <p>§ I. WHerein I shall first prove in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, the indispensible <hi>Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which our Saviour has laid upon us to receive this Sacrament. 2. The <hi>Extent</hi> of it, it reaches <hi>all adult</hi> Christians. 3. Its <hi>Duration,</hi> 'tis <hi>perpetual,</hi> it lasts till the <hi>End of the World.</hi> 4. That we ought to receive it <hi>frequently;</hi> And in the 5th and last place, I shall answer those <hi>Objections</hi> which are brought either against <hi>receiving</hi> the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> in general, or against <hi>frequently</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving it.</p>
               <p>§ II. <hi>1st.</hi> Of the <hi>Obligation</hi> in general to receive. And one would wonder how any, who are called <hi>Christians,</hi> and do but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the <hi>Reason</hi> of that <hi>Name,</hi> should ever think themselves <hi>dispensed</hi> with from that
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:106561:28"/>
Obligation; since there is scarce any so <hi>ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant</hi> as not to know that 'tis the express <hi>Command</hi> of our <hi>Lord Christ,</hi> 
                  <q>Do this in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of me.</q> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>St.</hi> Luke 22. 19.</note> He has the <hi>supream Authority</hi> over us, and we have <hi>professed</hi> an entire <hi>Obedience</hi> unto his <hi>Laws,</hi> and have vowed at <hi>Baptism</hi> to keep Gods holy Will and <hi>Commandments;</hi> and there is not one <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> in the Gospel more <hi>express</hi> than this is.

us not to <hi>abstain,</hi> but to <hi>feast,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to obtain his <hi>Favour.</hi> Have we not all <hi>broken</hi> our <hi>Covenant</hi> with God, and ought it not to be the most welcome <hi>Tidings</hi> to us in the World that we may again <hi>renew</hi> it? Have we nothing to <hi>thank</hi> him for, that we are so backward to render him this <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> of Praise? Or is it not to him we owe our <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Breath,</hi> and <hi>Being,</hi> and yet more, if it be not our own faults, our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi> our <hi>Salvation</hi> and our eternal <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness?</hi> Have we no <hi>Ingenuity,</hi> have we no <hi>Gratitude</hi> left, or can we give God <hi>thanks</hi> in a <hi>better</hi> way than in that which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self has <hi>appointed;</hi> in the <hi>highest</hi> and most <hi>solemn Ordinance</hi> of his <hi>Holy Gospel?</hi> Is <hi>Holy Friendship,</hi> is <hi>Christian Unity</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> so <hi>frightful</hi> a thing, that we will not so much as endure this <hi>Symbol</hi> of it? Is it not a good and <hi>pleasant thing for Brethren to dwell together in Unity?</hi> Is there any <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,</hi> any <hi>Endearment</hi> so <hi>close</hi> so intimate among Men, as that which is professed, encreased and exercised among <hi>Christians</hi> at this <hi>Holy Table?</hi> Is it not a desirable, a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary thing to be at <hi>Peace,</hi> to be <hi>Friends</hi> with all Mankind, to <hi>forgive</hi> our <hi>Enemies,</hi> to have the <hi>Love</hi> and the <hi>Prayers</hi> of all Good Men?

Mind exceeding <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>happy?</hi> And is not this happy <hi>Temper</hi> to be very much <hi>heightened</hi> and <hi>strengthened</hi> by our coming to the Lord's Table, and even by our <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> for it, as well as by our actually <hi>partaking</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>§ III. And if all this be not enough, if it be not sufficient to have <hi>Peace on Earth,</hi> or we do not much regard it; are we not however desirous to be at <hi>Peace with Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven?</hi> God reaches out to us in this Holy Sacrament the <hi>Pledges</hi> of his <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and <hi>Friendship;</hi> He sends his Ministers to assure us hereof; nay, he sends his own Son <hi>(surely we will reverence the Son!)</hi> as an <hi>Hostage,</hi> to satisfie us of the kindness of his <hi>Intentions:</hi> We <hi>entertained</hi> him not, 'tis true, as we <hi>ought</hi> to <hi>have done:</hi> The <hi>Heir was killed,</hi> he was <hi>stoned,</hi> he was cast out of the <hi>Vineyard</hi> by <hi>ungrateful Husbandmen:</hi> well, he only requires that we should <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member</hi> his <hi>Death,</hi> and not <hi>crucifie</hi> him anew by our Sins, by our <hi>neglecting</hi> this or other Duties: and <hi>is this our Kindness to our Friend,</hi> that we think this too much <hi>to do</hi> for him, especially when he has done so <hi>much</hi> for us? Surely he left us such a <hi>Legacy</hi> as deserved that we should <hi>think</hi> on him that <hi>left</hi> it; tho' 'tis true, the <hi>Payment</hi> thereof is <hi>condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,</hi>

               <p>§ IV. Is this worth <hi>desiring?</hi> Or are these only <hi>Fancies,</hi> and the fair, but fading <hi>Colours</hi> of <hi>Rhetorick</hi> and <hi>Imagination?</hi> Ask any ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>pious person,</hi> who comes with <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Devotion</hi> to this Sacrament, whether they are not as <hi>sure</hi> of all this as that they <hi>breath?</hi> Whether <hi>Iesus</hi> has not been <hi>known</hi> of 'em in <hi>breaking of Bread,</hi> and they have not been often fill'd at his <hi>Holy Table</hi> with <hi>Ioy</hi> unspeakable and full of <hi>Glory?</hi> A <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional,</hi> nay we may call it, a <hi>divine Ioy</hi> and Satisfaction, because we know its <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,</hi> we <hi>know</hi> its <hi>Object.</hi> Good Men speak what they <hi>know,</hi> and <hi>testifie</hi> what they have <hi>seen,</hi> and can almost arise to that <hi>Testimony</hi> of the Apostle concerning Christs actual <hi>Bodily presence</hi> here upon Earth, <note n="*" place="margin">1 St. <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. 3.</note>

§ V. Well, if we believe the <hi>Foretasts</hi> of Heaven worth <hi>desiring,</hi> worth <hi>thirsting</hi> after; our blessed <hi>Immortality,</hi> our happy <hi>Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> worth securing; the <hi>earnest</hi> thereof worth <hi>enjoying;</hi> we shall think all these no contemptible <hi>Arguments</hi> or weak <hi>Motives</hi> to perswade us to the Reception of this Holy <hi>Communion:</hi> We shall not easily slight our Saviour's <hi>Command,</hi> or those great and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>estimable <hi>Benefits</hi> we shall all partake of, if we are worthily <hi>present</hi> at it.</p>

strengthen us in <hi>Virtue.</hi> We are <hi>unthankful</hi> as well as <hi>disobedient;</hi> and too like those in the Gospel, who slighted the repeated <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> of the King, who sent out his Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers to call 'em to the <hi>Marriage,</hi> but they would not come, <hi>St.</hi> Matt. 22. 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for which he justly declared, that those who were <hi>bidden</hi> were not <hi>worthy,</hi> v. 8 (there are <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Non-Communicants,</hi> as well as <hi>unworthy Communicants)</hi> and that none of them should taste of his Feast; nor was this all, for he sent <hi>forth his Armies and destroyed those Murderers, and burnt up their City.</hi> v. 7.

§ VII.

§ IX. [Which is as evident from <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> as 'tis from Reason.] <q>As oft as ye eat of this Bread, shew ye forth the Lord's Death <hi>till he come,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 26. namely, till his <hi>second coming</hi> to judge the World;</q> in which sense that Expression is generally used in Scripture, especially by this Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle. Thus he tells us, <q>That at the last day, those which are <hi>alive,</hi> and remain till the coming of the Lord, shall not prevent those which are <hi>asleep</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1 Thess. 4. 15.</note>;</q> which whole Description evidently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the <hi>last Iudgment.</hi> And our Saviour uses that Expression in the same Sense in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to St. <hi>Iohn,</hi> who himself interprets that Phrase, <q>[if I will that he carry <hi>till I come,]</hi>
                  </q> by that other, <q>that that <hi>Disciple should not die.</hi>

§ X. But further: None will deny that we must <hi>offer</hi> the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praise</hi> unto God thro' Christ, to the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>World:</hi> That we must <hi>commemorate,</hi> and <hi>represent</hi> our Saviour's <hi>Death,</hi> in such <hi>manner</hi> as he has <hi>appointed.</hi> That we may, and ought to <hi>renew</hi> our <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> with God, and solemnly to express our <hi>union</hi> with all good Men, and <hi>dedicate</hi> our selves to the most <hi>High,</hi> and <hi>sacrifice</hi> our <hi>Sins</hi> before him; and that all this shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver cease till <hi>Time</hi> shall be no more: If then we ought to perform all these things <hi>singly,</hi> why not <hi>altogether</hi> in this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as we are sure the Church of God has done ever since its <hi>Institution</hi> in all <hi>Places</hi> and all <hi>Ages?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XI. And as the Arguments for the <hi>perpetual Obligations</hi> of our Saviour's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands in relation to this Sacrament, are unanswerable, so the Objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it appear so thin and contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that one would wonder how any Men of <hi>Sense</hi> should ever <hi>stumble</hi> upon them. The chief pretences of those who oppose the <hi>perpetuity</hi> of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:106561:34"/>
are, that the <hi>coming</hi> of the Lord men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> was only his <hi>spiritual</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Answer to <hi>Snake in Grass,</hi> p. 113. <hi>Naylor</hi>'s Love to the Lost, <hi>p.</hi> 77.</note> 
                  <hi>coming,</hi> and that the <hi>Communion</hi> of his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> is also <hi>spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> as oppos'd to any <hi>outward partaking</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>§ XII But that the <hi>coming</hi> of Christ here mentioned, must be understood of his <hi>last coming</hi> to Judgment, has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready proved from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>use</hi> of that Expression in other places: Nor does it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that he ever uses it in any <hi>other Sense.</hi> However, it cannot be taken here for his <hi>appearance,</hi> or <hi>coming</hi> by his <hi>Spirit</hi> only in the Hearts of Believers, because that was already <hi>accomplished</hi> in those who were <hi>baptised,</hi> and had sincerely embrac'd the <hi>Gospel.</hi> He was certainly <hi>come</hi> to the <hi>Apostle</hi> himself, in a very high and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous degree and manner, far beyond what any Christians can now expect, and yet he <hi>received</hi> the Sacrament; for he says, <hi>We are all partakers</hi> of that <hi>one Bread,</hi> that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>literal Bread</hi> whereof he was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coursing. Nor was it only the <hi>Mystery</hi> which he had <hi>received</hi> of the Lord <note n="*" place="margin">Vide supra.</note>, but directions
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:106561:35"/>
for the whole <hi>outward administration,</hi> which he <hi>describes</hi> at large in the place formerly quoted <note n="†" place="margin">1 Cor. II. 23.</note>, which we do <hi>truly perform</hi> as far as the <hi>outward cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration,</hi> if we <hi>eat</hi> the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> the <hi>Wine,</hi> and there is far more than a <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> for our doing it, since we have a <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitive Command.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XIII. Nor therefore is it enough to pretend that we receive inwardly and <hi>spiritually,</hi> unless we do it outwardly also, since Christ has appointed such an <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward administration?</hi> 'Tis true, the <hi>out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> part, without the <hi>inward,</hi> is so far from being <hi>beneficial,</hi> that 'tis thro' his own fault highly <hi>dangerous</hi> to the <hi>Receiver:</hi> But God's <hi>Word</hi> enjoyns us <hi>both,</hi> and the <hi>latter</hi> is conveyed by the <hi>former. Teaching</hi> all Nations, as well as <hi>baptising</hi> them, was to continue to the <hi>End</hi> of the World; but yet all own, that neither the <hi>outward Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> nor <hi>Baptism</hi> can avail, without the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teaching</hi> and <hi>Baptism</hi> of the <hi>Spirit;</hi> and the same may be said of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and other <hi>Christian Duties.</hi> I shall conclude this Head with the <hi>Concessions</hi> of the chief Teachers of those who deny the <hi>perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuity</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:106561:35"/>
of this Ordinance, one of whom says, <note n="*" place="margin">Answer to <hi>Snake,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 114.</note>
                  <q>That they do not censure those who are conscientiously tender in Observation of these things, and for practising what they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is their Duty, either in <hi>breaking</hi> of <hi>Bread,</hi> or in <hi>Water-Baptism.</hi>
                  </q> And ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther before him <note n="†" place="margin">Naylor.</note> who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends a concern for those who were <hi>troubled in mind</hi> about this Sacrament, owns, <q>That the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> is of great <hi>use and profit</hi> to <hi>weak Believers,</hi> for bringing them into one <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Heart.</hi>
                  </q> For us therefore who dare not pretend to <hi>perfection,</hi> but whose best Plea must be that of the Publican, <q>God be <hi>merciful</hi> to <hi>me a Sinner;</hi>
                  </q> let us cry out with the Disciples, <q>Lord increase our Faith;</q> and make use of the same <hi>means,</hi> the same <hi>Holy Sacraments</hi> which they made use of, that we may obtain our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires. Which we shall be more careful to do, if we set before our Eyes the dreadful Examples of those who by <hi>slighting</hi> and forsaking the Sacraments, and especially this <hi>Memorial</hi> of Christ's Death, have fallen into <hi>damnable Heresies,</hi> denying the Lord that <hi>bought</hi> them; either denying his <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi> or even his very<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

themselves; or else <hi>forsaking</hi> him by wicked Works, and falling into all manner of <hi>Licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiousness</hi> and <hi>Lewdness;</hi> all which might have been prevented, had they been devoutly and frequently present at this Holy Ordinance.</p>
               <p>§ XIV. Nor is it less evident that we are to receive the <hi>Communion frequently,</hi> than that the <hi>Obligation</hi> to receive it is <hi>perpetual;</hi> which will appear from the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and from the Words of Institution. From the Apostle's <hi>Example,</hi> and that of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> and the <hi>Commands</hi> and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and of all others who think themselves at any time obliged to <hi>receive</hi> it; as well as from the great Benefits to be obtained by frequent and devout Communion.</p>
               <p>§ XV. 1. The <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> the very <hi>Form</hi> and <hi>Words</hi> of <hi>Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,</hi> sufficiently prove, that we ought <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi> to communicate. 'Tis a <hi>Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> of our Saviour's Death, a <hi>Renewing</hi> of our <hi>Covenant</hi> with God, a <hi>solemn Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of our <hi>Religion</hi> and Badge of our <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi> a <hi>means</hi> to receive <hi>Divine Assistance,</hi> and how then can we be too frequently <hi>present</hi> at it? Our Lord has not, 'tis true, precisely determined <hi>how often</hi> we should
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:106561:36"/>
come, for he has left this to the <hi>Discretion</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and as a <hi>Tryal</hi> of our <hi>Devotion:</hi> But the very <hi>Words</hi> of <hi>Institution</hi> seem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire our presence <hi>frequently;</hi> for if we are to do this in <hi>Remembrance</hi> of our Saviour, and the <hi>oftner</hi> we do it, the <hi>better</hi> and more <hi>lively</hi> will be our <hi>Remembrance</hi> of him, if we perform it with due <hi>Reverence</hi> and <hi>Devotion;</hi> if this be granted, we cannot, I think, be too <hi>frequent</hi> at the Holy Table. Nay, the Apostle hints something to this purpose as our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's <hi>own</hi> Command, who at the Institution, when he spake of the <hi>Cup,</hi> required his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples to do this [as <hi>oft]</hi> as they drank it: whence the Apostle draws this Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. For [as <hi>often]</hi> as you <hi>eat</hi> of this <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> of this <hi>Cup,</hi> &amp;c. which Words do at the least imply some <hi>frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> in the reception of the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> both as <hi>commanded</hi> by our Saviour and <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised</hi> by his <hi>Apostles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XVI. Whose undoubted <hi>Practice,</hi> as it may be evinced from other places, is a farther Argument for <hi>frequent</hi> Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. For the first Christians, we read, <q>continued <hi>daily</hi> with one accord, <hi>breaking Bread</hi> from House to House. And again, continued stedfastly in the Apostle's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and their <hi>Communion,</hi> in breaking

               <p>§ XVII.

§ XVIII. And indeed, one would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how this <hi>Sacrament</hi> came to be so rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly received, and what should be the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> of that inexcusable <hi>Neglect</hi> which we find at present in the <hi>Western Churches,</hi> and particularly amongst our <hi>own People,</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to that <hi>Holy Ordinance.</hi> Now upon an impartial Enquiry, it will appear that this is chiefly owing to two Causes: First, the great <hi>decay</hi> of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>degenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of <hi>Christianity,</hi> when the <hi>Love of many waxed cold,</hi> and the <hi>great Apostacy</hi> broke in upon the <hi>Western Patriarchate.</hi> But there seems to be a second Cause of it, namely, the monstrous Doctrine of <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> already mentioned and confuted; which when the <hi>Romanists</hi> had once stumbled upon, it seems they dared not trust the Laity with <hi>frequent Communions,</hi> lest if they <hi>often</hi> saw the <hi>Bread,</hi> and <hi>touched</hi> and <hi>tasted</hi> it, they should be tempted, as many of their Priests now are, from the same Reason, at last to <hi>believe</hi> their <hi>Senses,</hi> and to think it really <hi>Bread,</hi> and not that <hi>natural Flesh</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> which hung upon the <hi>Cross.</hi> To prevent which, they took care to let the Laity <hi>receive</hi> but very <hi>rarely,</hi> tho' the <hi>Priest</hi> himself does it <hi>every day,</hi> at least if the <hi>Mass</hi> be the <hi>Communion,</hi> tho' how he can <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:106561:39"/>
by <hi>himself,</hi> is something difficult to a <hi>Protestant understanding;</hi> but since 'tis a flat <hi>Contradiction</hi> in Terms, we must acknowledge 'tis the more like <hi>Transubstantiation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XIX. And for our own <hi>Nation,</hi> 'tis well if the <hi>same Enemy</hi> which has sown so many other <hi>Tares</hi> among us, has not had a Hand in these also; for it had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible to have form'd any <hi>Schism</hi> amongst us, had we still practised <hi>frequent Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi> However, thus much we are sure of, that the unwary Expressions of some who had the <hi>Guidance</hi> of <hi>Consciences</hi> in the last Age, and their insisting only on the <hi>terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble danger</hi> of <hi>unworthy Receiving,</hi> but sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or never on that of resusing to <hi>receive</hi> at all, or neglecting an Opportunity when offer'd, was a great occasion of this <hi>Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience;</hi> which as it went so high in those days that in some places they had never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the <hi>Communion</hi> in five, six or seven, nay, not in fourteen Years, <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Jeans</hi> and Dr. <hi>Casaubon,</hi> in the Bp. of <hi>Derry</hi>'s Admonit. <hi>Lightfoot,</hi> Vol. 2. p. 1127.</note> so we are assured, by Authors of good Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, that the <hi>use</hi> of the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> was in divers Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes at length hardly <hi>known</hi> or <hi>named.</hi> And tho' this very ill Custom has been since amended
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:106561:39"/>
by those who began it, at least here in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> yet the <hi>Leven</hi> of it remains so dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd thro' a great part of the Nation, that it will not be easie to bring them to a <hi>better mind.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XX. However, we have both the <hi>Command,</hi> and the <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> to engage us to <hi>frequent Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. Three times</hi> a year, at the <hi>least,</hi> it was brought to at the Reformation. His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Majesty's <hi>Injunctions</hi> require the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy to administer the Holy Sacrament <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently;</hi> and most of the Episcopal <hi>Charges,</hi> and <hi>Articles</hi> do the same. And the <hi>Rubrick,</hi> that in Cathedral and Collegiate-Churches, they shall ALL receive at <hi>least</hi> every <hi>Sunday.</hi> And the <hi>Communion Service</hi> is still continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on <hi>Sundays</hi> and <hi>Holidays</hi> in all our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, to put Persons in mind of their Duty, and there's no doubt but the Church would have the <hi>Communion</hi> actually <hi>celebrated</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is a sufficient Number to receive <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vid.</hi> Rubrick after Communion. <hi>Parag.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4.</note>; and there are now <hi>monthly Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munions</hi> in <hi>many,</hi> and 'tis to be hoped, <hi>most</hi> of the considerable <hi>Towns</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and in <hi>London,</hi> in several Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, every <hi>Lord's Day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:106561:40"/>
And even our <hi>Dissenting Brethren</hi> are so far convinced of their former <hi>miscarriages</hi> in this matter, that they have now, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, <hi>monthly Communions;</hi> and if we have followed them in their <hi>Errors,</hi> ought we not much more to do so in their <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XXI. The Advantages of <hi>frequent Communion,</hi> to the great <hi>Ends</hi> of <hi>Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> and <hi>Reformation,</hi> to all the parts of a <hi>good Life,</hi> shall be the last Argument to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage to the <hi>practice</hi> of it. How far the <hi>Sacrament</hi> it self conduces to those <hi>Ends</hi> has been already declared, and the more <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi> we receive it, as we ought; the <hi>greater Benefit</hi> shall we obtain by it. The <hi>oftner</hi> the <hi>Vows</hi> of God are renewed upon us, the <hi>stronger</hi> will the <hi>Cord</hi> be, and with more <hi>difficulty</hi> to be <hi>broken.</hi> The <hi>oftner</hi> we come to these <hi>Waters of Life,</hi> the more will our Souls be <hi>refresht</hi> by them; the more <hi>frequently</hi> we <hi>partake</hi> of this <hi>Bread</hi> of Life, the greater <hi>Strength</hi> shall we receive in the <hi>inward Man,</hi> and higher Degrees of Grace and <hi>assistance</hi> in God's Service. And as the great <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> of the <hi>Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Christians</hi> already mention'd, was very much owing to their <hi>daily Communion;</hi> so if we impartially consider those amongst
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:106561:40"/>
us who do <hi>most frequently</hi> communicate, I'm persuaded we should find them the most <hi>devout</hi> and <hi>rational</hi> Christians, and generally the <hi>best of Men;</hi> whilst those are the most <hi>profligate Wretches</hi> who have no <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi> at all to this <hi>blessed Feast,</hi> and thro' the <hi>whole course</hi> of their <hi>Lives</hi> scarce ever <hi>receive</hi> it.</p>
               <p>§ XXII. But 'twill now be time to consider those <hi>Objections</hi> which are brought against <hi>receiving</hi> this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> or at least against <hi>frequent Communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the First, Against <hi>receiving in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,</hi> the most common Objections may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd to the following Heads. Either a <hi>bad Life,</hi> or <hi>multiplicity</hi> of <hi>Business,</hi> or want of <hi>preparation,</hi> or the danger of <hi>receiving unworthily;</hi> or else the <hi>manner</hi> of receiving, and the <hi>ill Characters,</hi> perhaps of some of the <hi>Communicants:</hi> The <hi>four former</hi> being usually brought by Persons of all Persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the <hi>two latter,</hi> principally by those who are dissatisfied with our <hi>way of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XXIII. As for the <hi>first,</hi> and more common rank of <hi>Excuses,</hi> before we come to the particular Consideration of them, it may deserve a Remark, that our Church
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:106561:41"/>
has already <hi>fully answered</hi> them; and all Persons have heard as much, as often as they have heard the Minister read the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations</hi> at the warning for the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before the <hi>Communion;</hi> and therefore 'tis neither <hi>fair</hi> nor <hi>modest,</hi> it argues nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Ingenuity</hi> nor <hi>Conscience,</hi> still to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist upon them, without any <hi>addition</hi> to their <hi>Strength,</hi> or taking notice of what has been said to satisfy them. The two former Objections, <hi>Business</hi> and a <hi>bad Life,</hi> are answer'd in the second Exhortation, in these words. <q>It's an easie matter for a Man to say, I will not communicate, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I am otherwise hinder'd by world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Business. But such Excuses are not so easily <hi>accepted</hi> and <hi>allowed</hi> before God. They that refus'd the Feast in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel, because they had bought a <hi>Farm,</hi> &amp;c were not so excused, but counted unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the Heavenly Feast.</q> And as to that which is taken from a <hi>bad Life,</hi> 'tis added, <q>If any Man say I am a grievous Sinner, and therefore am afraid to come, wherefore then do ye not repent and a mend?</q> The two latter, <hi>Unprepared<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> and the Fear of <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking unworthily,</hi> are also fairly hinted at in the End of the first Exhortation, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy appointed for them. <q>If any Man
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:106561:41"/>
cannot quiet his Conscience, but requires farther <hi>Comfort</hi> or <hi>Counsel,</hi> he is directed to go to the Minister of his Parish,</q> or (such is the Church's Caution and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence in so tender an Affair) <q>to any other Discreet and Learned Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of God's Word, and open his Grief, that he may receive Ghostly Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, or Spiritual Advice, suitable to his Condition.</q> And he who neglects to take this Method, it's evident that he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther does not <hi>understand,</hi> or does not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard</hi> the Churches Direction in these Matters.</p>
               <p>§ XXIV. But to come to the more particular Examination of these <hi>Objections.</hi> The first of which is taken from a <hi>wicked Life,</hi> a Man's being a most <hi>grievous Sinner,</hi> and therefore he comes not to the <hi>Holy Table.</hi> This is, indeed, a most <hi>inexcusable Excuse,</hi> for tho' some have thought that a Duty may <hi>attone</hi> for a <hi>Sin,</hi> yet one would think none should be so wild to persuade themselves that <hi>one Sin</hi> could ever attone for <hi>another?</hi> But in answer to it, we must say of this Sacrament, as <hi>Ananias</hi> did to St. <hi>Paul</hi> of that of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism, <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 22. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Why tarriest thou? arise and be baptised and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:106561:42"/>
wash away thy Sins.</hi> The <hi>Sacraments</hi> are doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, Means to <hi>confer Grace</hi> on those that are truly <hi>penitent,</hi> truly sensible of their <hi>Sins,</hi> and afflicted for them; as well as to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm</hi> and <hi>strengthen</hi> it in those who already lead a <hi>holy Life.</hi> It's true, that the <hi>Lord's Table</hi> is no place for a wicked Man who resolves to <hi>continue</hi> in his <hi>wickedness,</hi> who does not <hi>heartily resolve,</hi> by God's Grace, to <hi>strive</hi> against it, and <hi>actually</hi> and <hi>imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately</hi> forsake it: For it is not meet to cast the <hi>Children's Bread</hi> to <hi>Dogs,</hi> and the <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> is a Token and Pledge of <hi>Pardon</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> the <hi>Seal</hi> of a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant</hi> between God and Man: But what has any to do with the <hi>Sign</hi> who has not the <hi>Substance?</hi> What has a <hi>stubborn Rebel</hi> to do with his <hi>Prince's Pardon?</hi> Yet after all, we know that Christ came into the World to <hi>save Sinners,</hi> tho' he saves them no other way but by <hi>Repentance;</hi> nor is it while they <hi>remain</hi> so, but upon a <hi>change</hi> of their minds, that he actually <hi>justifies</hi> the <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</hi> 'Tis not the <hi>repenting</hi> Sinner, but the <hi>obstinate</hi> Sinner that is excluded from the <hi>Lord s Table,</hi> who is also, if he lives and dyes such, as certainly as God is true, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded</hi> out of <hi>Heaven.</hi> But for those who are indeed <hi>desirous</hi> to do <hi>better,</hi> tho' their <hi>Faith</hi> be yet but as a <hi>Grain</hi> of <hi>Mustard-Seed,</hi>
                  <pb n="71" facs="tcp:106561:42"/>
they shall not be <hi>rejected,</hi> by that <hi>mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful Redeemer</hi> who will not <hi>break</hi> the <hi>bruised Reed,</hi> nor <hi>quench</hi> the <hi>smoaking Flax:</hi> and surely, the <hi>Sacrament</hi> cannot but have that good effect on all who are not quite <hi>har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den'd,</hi> as to make them <hi>think</hi> on their ways, and <hi>amend</hi> their Lives when they <hi>approach</hi> unto it. And 'tis well if the great Reason which keeps many from it, be not, lest they should be thereby obliged to <hi>forsake</hi> their <hi>Sins,</hi> (which they are not yet willing to do,) and to the Exercise of an exact <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,</hi> and severe <hi>Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XXV. And as some have raised Objections against <hi>Receiving,</hi> because of <hi>Sins</hi> that are <hi>past,</hi> or of which they may be at <hi>that very time</hi> guilty, so there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who say they dare not come to the Sacrament, for fear of <hi>falling</hi> into Sin <hi>after</hi> they have received, as if that were <hi>unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable;</hi> an <hi>Error</hi> much of the same Nature with that which some Persons ran into in the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> who deferr'd their <hi>Baptism</hi> till the <hi>point of Death</hi> for the same Reason. But in answer; as 'tis granted that <hi>Sins</hi> after <hi>Baptism</hi> may be forgiven, on true <hi>Repentance,</hi> so doubtless they may after the other <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;</hi> for not only the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> but even the <hi>Apostles</hi> themselves were guilty
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:106561:43"/>
of <hi>failings</hi> after the <hi>Communion.</hi> A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd <hi>Habit,</hi> or inveterate <hi>Course</hi> of Sin is <hi>damnable,</hi> as well <hi>before</hi> the Sacrament as <hi>after</hi> it: But the devout and <hi>frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving</hi> of it, is the best way to prevent the <hi>falling</hi> into such a <hi>desperate Condition:</hi> And for <hi>lesser failings,</hi> from which none are free, those will be <hi>forgiven</hi> if we are truly <hi>peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent</hi> for them, and constantly strive against them.</p>
               <p>§ XXVI. Another <hi>Pretence,</hi> something allied to this last, is, That Men are at <hi>Variance</hi> with their Neighbours, and that keeps them from the Sacrament. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, 'Tis own'd that we ought to come to this <hi>Feast of Love</hi> with true <hi>Charity, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving</hi> all our Enemies, which if we do not practise every day, we cannot so much as repeat the <hi>Lord</hi>'s <hi>Prayer,</hi> without impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating a <hi>heavy Curse</hi> upon our selves: But in the present case, the matter may be brought to a short Issue: Either you have really <hi>offended</hi> your <hi>Neighbour,</hi> or <hi>he</hi> has offended <hi>you,</hi> or as it often happens, you are <hi>both</hi> to <hi>blame:</hi> If the <hi>former,</hi> you know your <hi>Duty;</hi> 
                  <q>Leave thy Gift before the Altar, and be <hi>reconciled</hi> to thy Brother, and then come and offer thy Gift: If the second, and he trespass against thee
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:106561:43"/>
seven times a day, and say, I have offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, forgive him, and receive together with him.</q> If <hi>both</hi> are in <hi>fault,</hi> both must make <hi>satisfaction:</hi> If either <hi>refuses</hi> to be <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,</hi> the <hi>Fault</hi> is in the <hi>Refuser,</hi> not in him that is <hi>willing,</hi> who shall not be <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd</hi> for the other's <hi>Guilt;</hi> tho' the <hi>uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Person,</hi> is by no means fit for this <hi>Holy Table,</hi> while he continues in that <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Temper.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XXVII. <hi>[Multiplicity of Business</hi> is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother <hi>Excuse,</hi> or <hi>Objection</hi> against <hi>Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.]</hi> The <hi>Cumber</hi> of <hi>worldly Affairs,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>troubled,</hi> like <hi>Martha,</hi> about many things, while this <hi>one thing,</hi> which is so very <hi>needful,</hi> is too often postpon'd and neglected: exactly the same pretence with theirs in the <hi>Parable</hi> already mention'd, who when the King sent to invite them to the <hi>Marriage</hi> of his <hi>Son,</hi> began with one consent to make Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuses, and went their way, one to his <hi>Farm,</hi> another to his <hi>Merchandise.</hi> One said, <hi>I have bought a piece of ground, and must needs go to see it;</hi> which as indifferent an Excuse as it was, was yet better than theirs who absent themselves from God's publick Worship, only to go and <hi>see</hi> their <hi>Ground,</hi> when they <hi>long before</hi> have bought it. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>I have bought five Yoke of Oxen, and
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:106561:44"/>
I go to prove them.</hi> He had his <hi>Stock</hi> to look after, which he thought an <hi>unanswer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Reason</hi> for his <hi>absence.</hi> As the third did, who had married a <hi>Wife</hi> and could not come, but must stay at home to look after the <hi>Affairs</hi> of his <hi>Family.</hi> 'Tis well worthy our Consideration how <hi>open</hi> the Holy Spirit has here laid the common <hi>Springs</hi> of Mens <hi>neglect</hi> and <hi>indevotion</hi> in these and the like matters: All which Excuses are so contriv'd that they seem to insinuate, as if the Sacrament were only for <hi>recluse Persons,</hi> such as are <hi>abstracted</hi> from the World, and live <hi>like Monks</hi> and <hi>Hermits;</hi> whereas it's evident that 'twas <hi>designed</hi> for <hi>all Christians,</hi> and one great End of it, was, to take <hi>off</hi> our <hi>Hearts</hi> from the World, and <hi>fit</hi> us for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. But to be more particular, 'twill be easie to shew, that this pretence of <hi>Business</hi> to excuse Persons from receiving the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is almost always either <hi>false,</hi> or <hi>vain,</hi> or <hi>wicked,</hi> or altogether.</p>
               <p>§ XXVIII. 1. It's often <hi>false</hi> in Fact, and we are not really so hinder'd by Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, but we might be <hi>there,</hi> if we had any regard either to the <hi>Feast</hi> or to the <hi>Inviter:</hi> since that <hi>Business</hi> can only excuse us, which could not possibly be done <hi>before,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done <hi>after,</hi> and which must of <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:106561:44"/>
be done at the very time when we should receive: But if Men would be <hi>ingenuous,</hi> they would be forced to acknowledge that they very rarely have any <hi>Business</hi> of this nature. And indeed, what Business, unless of such high <hi>necessity</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> has a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian to do on the <hi>Lord's Day;</hi> the very <hi>Name</hi> whereof shews the <hi>propriety;</hi> and that 'tis none of our own, but set apart for a <hi>Holy Rest,</hi> and Christian <hi>Sabbath,</hi> and the immediate Service of our blessed Redeemer? Nor is it at all probable, that those who can find time, notwithstanding all this <hi>urgent Business,</hi> for <hi>Visits,</hi> for the <hi>Entertainment</hi> of their <hi>Friends,</hi> for idle and unprofitable <hi>Discourse,</hi> (both <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Lord's. Day,</hi> and even <hi>upon</hi> it) and it's well, if not for their <hi>Sins</hi> too, should yet be able to find no time for their <hi>Saviour,</hi> when he invites them to his own Table. Judge then how wretched an <hi>Excuse</hi> this is, when by a palpable <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood</hi> Men would defend their <hi>Disobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XXIX. But secondly. This Excuse is <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>foolish:</hi> For supposing we should really find out some <hi>little</hi> Business to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy our selves in, just before, and during the <hi>Celebration,</hi> yet what can be more <hi>foolish</hi> than to put off a <hi>greater Affair</hi> for a <hi>less;</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:106561:45"/>
a matter of <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Death,</hi> for what's of <hi>little</hi> or no <hi>moment?</hi> But what's the <hi>whole World</hi> to my own <hi>Soul;</hi> and what a mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable exchange should I make, if thro' the <hi>Cares</hi> of this World, and the <hi>deceitfulness</hi> of Riches, I should by gaining the one, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally lose the other? Besides, if <hi>Business</hi> could defend a Person for <hi>one</hi> neglect or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, how immodest, as well as foolish, is it to bring always the same Excuse, and still to <hi>postpone</hi> our own Happiness, included in our <hi>Obedience?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XXX. And such a practice is as <hi>wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> as 'tis <hi>foolish.</hi> For 'tis a high <hi>Affront</hi> and <hi>Injury</hi> both to the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>King's Son;</hi> and will they not <hi>both</hi> extremely and justly <hi>resent</hi> it? 'Tis a Wrong and Injury done unto them, as much as 'tis in our <hi>Power</hi> to injure them: like him in the Gospel, rather to leave our Saviour than to <hi>part</hi> with our <hi>Possessions,</hi> or so much as to <hi>step</hi> out of the World for a <hi>few moments.</hi> To say we'll not come because we are <hi>busie,</hi> is in effect, to say we'll come <hi>when we have nothing else to do.</hi> To put it off till <hi>another time,</hi> is fairly to own, we think it a matter of no <hi>great concern,</hi> for whatever we think so, we set <hi>immediately</hi> about it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:106561:45"/>
§ XXXI. But there's oftentimes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very <hi>bad</hi> at the <hi>bottom</hi> of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, and those who make it, would do well seriously to ask themselves whether by <hi>Business</hi> they mean not something <hi>worse?</hi> some <hi>appendage</hi> to it, which <hi>stings</hi> their <hi>Consciences,</hi> and dares not let them come to the <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Are they not guilty of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance,</hi> or <hi>Injustice</hi> in their <hi>Dealings</hi> in the <hi>World?</hi> If they are, they must be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Answer given to those under the former Head, for no pretended <hi>neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity</hi> can <hi>excuse</hi> their <hi>Sin,</hi> and they have no other way to escape <hi>God's</hi> Anger, but Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Amendment.</p>
               <p>§ XXXII. A <hi>superstitious Fear,</hi> and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken <hi>Reverence</hi> for this Ordinance, and terrible apprehensions concerning it, chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grounded on some misapplied Texts of Scripture, do very frequently keep Persons from the <hi>Lord's Table.</hi> But if we are but as willing to <hi>know</hi> and to <hi>do</hi> our Duty as to make <hi>Excuses</hi> for the neglecting it, such a full Answer may be brought to these Objections, as would scarce fail to give Satisfaction.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:106561:46"/>
§ XXXIII. The first and chiefest Text, and which many have so often in their Mouths, as if <q>
                     <hi>Do this in remembrance of me,</hi>
                  </q> were never to be taken notice of; is that in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 29. <q>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself.</q> And there are se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Expressions sounding much the same way in the first Exhortation before the Communion, that we ought to be very careful when we come thither, <q>Lest it encrease our <hi>damnation,</hi> and lest Satan enter into us as he did into <hi>Iudas,</hi> and fill us full of all Iniquity, and bring us to destruction both of Body and Soul:</q> which very severe Sentences are here made use of, to perswade Men to true <hi>Repentance</hi> before they come to the <hi>Sacrament;</hi> but they can <hi>mean</hi> no more than that of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> whereon they are <hi>grounded,</hi> and therefore must be <hi>interpreted</hi> by it. And to understand that aright, we must enquire into the meaning of those two Phrases, <hi>Receiving unworthily,</hi> and that <hi>Damnation</hi> which is threaten'd upon it.</p>
               <p>§ XXXIV. And the <hi>context</hi> evidently shews, that the <hi>Receiving</hi> unworthily, for which the <hi>Corinthians</hi> are here blamed, was <hi>receiving</hi>
                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:106561:46"/>
with that <hi>inexcusable Disorder,</hi> whereof they were guilty at the <hi>Sacrament:</hi> One was <hi>hungry,</hi> and another <hi>drunken,</hi> at their <hi>Feasts of Charity,</hi> which then accompanied that Ordinance. There were <hi>Schisms</hi> and <hi>Divisions</hi> among them, even at that <hi>Feast;</hi> one great <hi>End</hi> whereof was to promote Christian <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> One came <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> another, and the <hi>Rich</hi> despised the <hi>Poor.</hi> They did not <hi>discern</hi> the <hi>Lord's Body.</hi> They made no <hi>difference</hi> between <hi>that</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Food,</hi> at least, <hi>consider'd it</hi> not as the <hi>Spiritual Body</hi> of the Lord, or, as some think, <note n="*" place="margin">Lightfoot.</note> not as a <hi>Christian Sacrament,</hi> but as a <hi>Heathen Feast,</hi> or a <hi>Iewish Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sover.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XXXV. Whereby they did eat and drink <hi>Damnation</hi> to themselves. By which cannot be immediately intended <hi>eternal Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> but <hi>temporal Iudgment,</hi> as the word here undoubtedly signifies, which we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slate more harshly by <hi>Damnation.</hi> For the following words explain it; <q>For this cause many are sick and weak, and many are faln asleep;</q> that is, God's heavy <hi>Iudgments</hi> fell upon them in this Life, some think a Plague, or some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Disease, in order to bring them
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:106561:47"/>
to <hi>Repentance;</hi> which Sense is confirm'd by the two following Verses. <q>If we would judge our selves, or consider of our Faults and <hi>repent</hi> and <hi>amend,</hi>
                  </q> we <q>should not be <hi>judged,</hi> that is, afflicted with these <hi>temporal evils.</hi>
                  </q> Tho', even those were in order to <hi>amendment,</hi> and such Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments as were proper to a <hi>State</hi> of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation,</hi> for it follows; <q>When we are <hi>judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> we are <hi>chasten'd</hi> of the Lord, that we should not be <hi>condemn'd</hi> with the world;</q> namely, at Gods last dreadful Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</p>
               <p>§ XXXVI. But it may be askt, is there no other <hi>unworthy receiving,</hi> and no other <hi>damnation</hi> as a consequent thereon, but what have been now describ'd? Yes doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less; for we then receive <hi>unworthily,</hi> when we <hi>continue</hi> in our <hi>Sins,</hi> notwithstanding our <hi>Obligations</hi> to leave them when we come to the <hi>Sacrament:</hi> And if we do not <hi>repent</hi> of this very <hi>hainous Sin</hi> and that in some proportion to the high <hi>Aggravations</hi> of it, the consequence of such <hi>impenitence</hi> will be no less than <hi>eternal misery.</hi> But still, it's e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from the foregoing Considerations, that neither of these are here in the Text <hi>immediately</hi> intended; and I think all sober Divines are agreed herein.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:106561:47"/>
§ XXXVII. Add to this, that there is not the least Ground in the Words, or in the whole Chapter, or indeed in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scripture, to <hi>excuse</hi> any Person for <hi>not receiving,</hi> or to <hi>deter</hi> them from doing it, but rather quite the contrary. Because the Man who had not the <hi>Wedding Garment</hi> was bound <hi>Hand</hi> and <hi>Foot</hi> and <hi>cast</hi> into <hi>utter darkness,</hi> did this <hi>excuse</hi> those, who <hi>would not come to the marriage?</hi> No, 'twas so far from it, that the <hi>King sent forth his Armies and destroyed those Murderers, and burnt up their City.</hi> Christ <hi>commands</hi> us to come, his <hi>Ministers invite</hi> us, 'tis our <hi>own Faults,</hi> if we come <hi>unprepared,</hi> but nothing can <hi>excuse</hi> our <hi>Neglect</hi> and Refusal. <hi>Let a man examine himself, and so let him</hi> (not stay away and refuse to receive, but) <hi>eat of this Bread and drink of this Cup.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XXXVIII. There's another Text which has been widely mistaken in the same manner, and on the same occasion. 'Tis that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> 
                  <q>He that doubteth is <hi>damned</hi> if he <hi>eat.</hi>
                  </q> But nothing can be plainer, than that this place has no manner of relation to the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> any more than to any <hi>other Food;</hi> for it's to be understood of <hi>eating meats sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:106561:48"/>
to Idols,</hi> or of any of those Meats which the <hi>Iews,</hi> from the <hi>ceremonial Law,</hi> accounted an <hi>abomination;</hi> whereof the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle says, that he who did it with a <hi>doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Conscience,</hi> without being <hi>satisfied</hi> of the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of it, he was <hi>damned</hi> or <hi>condemned,</hi> namely, by his <hi>own Conscience,</hi> which <hi>accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed</hi> and <hi>judged</hi> him for it: And this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be the immediate Sense of the words, by comparing them with the 14. <hi>v.</hi> 
                  <q>
                     <hi>I know, and am perswaded</hi> by the Lord Jesus, that is, either by Christ's words, <hi>that nothing which enters into the mouth defiles the man:</hi>
                  </q> or else, by <hi>immediate Inspiration,</hi> as he received many other things. <q>I know, says he, that there's nothing <hi>unclean of it self,</hi> but to him that <hi>esteemeth</hi> any thing <hi>unclean,</hi> to him it is <hi>unclean;</hi>
                  </q> which e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidently refers to those <hi>distinctions</hi> of <hi>Meats,</hi> which at that time made so great a <hi>distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance</hi> in the <hi>Church of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XXXIX. But since it may be urged, that <hi>acting</hi> with a <hi>doubting Conscience</hi> is a <hi>Sin,</hi> in what case soever, and therefore much more in relation to the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> we must in the last place consider the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>doubting,</hi> which compared with our <hi>Obligation</hi> to <hi>Duty,</hi> will quite re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this Objection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:106561:48"/>
We may reckon <hi>three Degrees</hi> of <hi>Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> 1. When Men have some small remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>scruples,</hi> and <hi>unreasonable</hi> unaccountable Fears, after the strictest <hi>Examination</hi> into the Rules of their <hi>Duty,</hi> and all moral <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction</hi> therein, concerning their <hi>Obligation</hi> unto it, or of the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of any Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the <hi>mind</hi> is as it were in a <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance,</hi> unresolved, whether a thing be <hi>lawful</hi> or <hi>unlawful,</hi> a <hi>Duty,</hi> or otherwise, and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons on neither side do sensibly and visibly <hi>preponderate,</hi> so as to incline to <hi>acting</hi> or <hi>not acting;</hi> and this is the most true and <hi>proper doubt.</hi> Or else,</p>
               <p n="3">3. When Men are absolutely <hi>dissatisfied,</hi> by reason of some mistaken <hi>Principles,</hi> or the <hi>Temptation</hi> of the <hi>Devil,</hi> so that they directly question God's <hi>mercy;</hi> or at least their own <hi>Fitness</hi> for it, and for the <hi>Seals</hi> of it, and thence are on the very <hi>brink of despair.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XL. As to the first of these Cases, where there only remain some <hi>unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Scruples,</hi> so that a Person says, <q>I am afraid to do such or such a thing, tho' <hi>I know not why I am afraid;</hi>
                  </q> and when whatsoever bears the <hi>Face</hi> of an Objection, has been fairly answered; the Rule is, we
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:106561:49"/>
                  <hi>may</hi> perform any <hi>indifferent Action,</hi> for that very reason, because it is <hi>indifferent,</hi> and there are no <hi>circumstances</hi> that alter its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; we <hi>must</hi> perform what is a <hi>certain Duty,</hi> as is in the case before us, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Sacrament, because we are to look on any <hi>unreasonable Scruples</hi> to the contrary, as no other than the Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>Enemy.</hi> If as in the second place, we do <hi>properly doubt,</hi> and the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments appear to us equal for the <hi>doing</hi> or <hi>not doing</hi> such an Action, we must <hi>omit</hi> an <hi>indifferent Action,</hi> because there can be no hurt in such <hi>omission,</hi> but there may be in the <hi>doing</hi> it; as in the case of <hi>eating Flesh</hi> lately mentioned; we <hi>may not</hi> omit a <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Duty,</hi> as receiving the Sacrament, but ought rather to <hi>suspect</hi> our own <hi>Reasoning</hi> where our Duty is so clear by undoubted <hi>Revelation;</hi> tho' we must carefully use those means which God has appointed for removing that <hi>Scruple</hi> and <hi>Doubtfulness.</hi> But in the third place, where the <hi>degree</hi> of doubting is so <hi>high,</hi> as to reach even to <hi>despair</hi> of <hi>God's mercy,</hi> from which dreadful Condition he evermore preserve us, and which is often the effect of some grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Sin, continued in without <hi>Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Repentance;</hi> this, I think, is the only doubting which <hi>incapacitates</hi> us for
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:106561:49"/>
                  <hi>receiving.</hi> And that this does so, is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in the first Exhortation before the <hi>Communion,</hi> 
                  <q>That 'tis requisite no Man should come to it, but with a <hi>full Trust</hi> in <hi>God's mercy,</hi> and with a <hi>quiet Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
                  </q> But then due methods must be used to obtain this happy Temper, and <q>he must open his Grief to his spiritual Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitian, that he may give his Advice and Prayers against the Tempter, and that he may receive the benefit of <hi>Absolution,</hi>
                  </q> or a solemn authoritative declaration of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don on his sincere Repentance. To which, if he adds his own Prayers and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, he may well hope that God will restore unto him the <hi>Ioy</hi> of his <hi>Salvation,</hi> and that he shall be admitted to this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Feast: To the <hi>neglect</hi> of which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, he ought to examine if he does not owe his <hi>present Trouble.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XLI. <hi>Want</hi> of <hi>Preparation</hi> is also of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten brought as an <hi>Excuse</hi> for not recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. Persons have not had <hi>Time</hi> for such <hi>strict Examination,</hi> as they think ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary, and therefore, they say, they dare not come. Now to this common and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Objection, I shall first oppose, both the Authority and Reason of a very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Person, who clears the whole difficulty
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:106561:50"/>
in a few words, <note n="*" place="margin">Arch-Bishop <hi>Tillotson</hi> of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Communion, <hi>Fol. Edit.</hi> p. 283, 284.</note> 
                  <q>It is, says he, a pious and commendable Custom in Christians before their coming to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to set apart some particular time for the Work of Examination; but how much every Person should allot, is a <hi>mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> of Prudence, some have reason to spend more time, because their accounts are heavier, and some have more leisure and freedom: But the <hi>End</hi> is to be prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally regarded, which is to <hi>understand</hi> our <hi>Condition,</hi> and to reform what's amiss; and if that be observed, whether more or less time be allowed, matters not much.</q> He goes on. <q>The <hi>best preparation</hi> for the Sacrament, is the <hi>general Care</hi> of a Good Life, and he that is thus prepared, may receive at all times, when opportunity is offered, tho' he <hi>had no particular fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sight of that opportunity,</hi> and he shall do much <hi>better</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> than to <hi>refrain,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he's habitually prepared, tho' he had no time for actual <hi>preparation;</hi> and (to quote no more) we cannot imagine that the <hi>Primitive Christians,</hi> who received so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly, could allot any more time for the <hi>preparation</hi> for it, than for any other part of <hi>divine Worship.</hi>
                  </q> Thus far the most reverend
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:106561:50"/>
Author, wherein he says nothing against either <hi>Preparation</hi> or <hi>Examination,</hi> which he owns to be highly useful, but only against refusing to receive for want of <hi>actual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration,</hi> or always allotting a <hi>considerable portion</hi> of time to this Exercise, even when Persons are before <hi>habitually prepared</hi> to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> and have not time for such actual Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
               <p>§ XLII. I cannot think of any other Objections made against receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament by any Persons who own them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves satisfied with the <hi>publick way</hi> of <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship;</hi> tho' there are two more, which have been brought by such as <hi>differ</hi> from us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. The first from the <hi>posture</hi> of receiving. The second from the <hi>Company.</hi> Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Disciples, they say, did at the first Institution, receive in a <hi>Table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture:</hi> and they dare not take it <hi>kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> because it looks so like that <hi>Adoration</hi> of the Sacrament, which we blame in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> Nor can they, without great <hi>Scandal,</hi> join with such a <hi>promiscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Society,</hi> some of whom, perhaps, to their own knowledge, may be very <hi>ill Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XLIII. In Answer to the first. The Sacrament being instituted in the room of

the <hi>Paschal Feast,</hi> and during the <hi>Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of it, our Saviour made use of the same <hi>posture</hi> wherein he and his Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were before placed, which being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Custom of the Antients in Feasting, a sort of recumbency or <hi>leaning</hi> on one another's Bosoms, neither <hi>sitting</hi> nor <hi>kneeling,</hi> it could not perhaps be changed without <hi>disorder,</hi> till the whole Ceremony was over. But from hence none can justly conclude, that the Gesture of <hi>kneeling</hi> at the Sacrament, in order to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press our deep <hi>Humility,</hi> is any ways un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful: <hi>Kneeling</hi> is a fit posture for all acts of <hi>Devotion.</hi> The <hi>Eucharist</hi> is the <hi>highest</hi> act of Worship, or rather, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it many other acts, Prayer, Praise, Thanksgiving and <hi>Adoration:</hi> And why should we not then in the celebration there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>fall down and kneel before the Lord our maker?</hi> The Jewish Church added the <hi>Bread</hi> and the <hi>Cup</hi> to the Passover; these our Saviour himself used in the administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof; and is not this a much great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <hi>alteration,</hi> than that of a <hi>single Gesture?</hi> He retained the second <hi>Cup of Blessing,</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the <hi>Iews,</hi> he received after Supper, with several other <hi>Circumstances</hi> which are not at present observed, even by those who make these. Objections against our <hi>Form,</hi>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:106561:51"/>
for much less <hi>considerable alterations.</hi> The main Reason why some well-meaning Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons might at first scruple <hi>kneeling</hi> at the Sacrament, seems to have been the Fear lest this should tend to the <hi>Adoration</hi> of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or of any fansied <hi>corporal presence</hi> of Christ's Body and Blood in them: But this is entirely precluded by our Church, who must be allowed to know best the <hi>meaning</hi> of her own <hi>Injunctions</hi> and <hi>Practice;</hi> and in order to prevent any misinterpretation of this innocent and decent Ceremony, she has expresly declared <note n="*" place="margin">Rubrick after Communion Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</note>, <q>That thereby no <hi>Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is intended, or ought to be done either unto the sacramental Bread and Wine, which is bodily received, or unto any corporal presence of Christ's natural Flesh and Blood.</q> And this has so far satisfied all Persons who are not extreamly prejudic'd, that the Members of Foreign Churches, who have received the Communion here in <hi>England,</hi> have willingly, and gladly done it <hi>kneeling.</hi>

has offer'd in the defence of it. <note n="*" place="margin">Baxter'<hi>s Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Directory,</hi> Part 2. pag. 3.</note> Who acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, that <q>for kneeling, he never heard any thing to prove it unlawful: If there be any thing, says he, it must be either some Word of God, or the Nature of the Ordinance which is supposed to be contradicted: But 1. There is no Word of God for, or against any Gesture: Christ's Example can never be intended to oblige us more in this, than in many other Circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that are confessedly not obligatory, as that he delivered it but to Ministers, but to a Family, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and his <hi>Gesture</hi> was not <hi>such a sitting</hi> as ours. 2.

               <p>§ XLIV. To the second Objection, That Persons cannot joyn with unworthy Communicants; we may first ask, who made any Man the <hi>Iudge of Hearts,</hi> and how we are <hi>sure</hi> any Person is <hi>unworthy,</hi> since none is so but the <hi>Impenitent?</hi> When our Saviour told his Disciples at the Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:106561:52"/>
of this Supper that <hi>one</hi> of them should <hi>betray</hi> him, they did not ask him, <hi>Lord is it my Neighbour?</hi> But <hi>Lord is it I?</hi> And accordingly, we ought surely to be more concerned for our <hi>selves</hi> than for <hi>others.</hi> And is it not suspicious that there's some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing very much amiss in our selves, when we are so ready to <hi>censure</hi> our Neighbours? Does it not look as if we were solicitous to take off Mens <hi>Eyes</hi> from our <hi>own Faults,</hi> tho' at the expence of another's <hi>Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> Let any one consider the World, and he'll soon acknowledge that the <hi>worst</hi> of Men are the most <hi>uncharitable.</hi> But farther, 'tis certain that the visible Church will always be made up of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Bad,</hi> and the <hi>Tares</hi> will never be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely separated from the <hi>Wheat</hi> till the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> Our Saviour knew that <hi>Iudas</hi> was a <hi>Devil,</hi> and yet he did not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move</hi> him from the Sacrament, nor <hi>refuse</hi> to <hi>receive</hi> with him. If other Men <hi>receive unworthily,</hi> to their own Master, they <hi>stand</hi> or <hi>fall,</hi> but that shall never injure me, if I my self am a <hi>worthy Receiver.</hi> But suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing there ought to be more <hi>exact Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> in any Church (and we know too well who those are that have now render'd that almost <hi>impracticable</hi> among us) yet this can be no just Reason for our not
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:106561:53"/>
                  <hi>communicating</hi> with it: Since the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> was more notoriously <hi>corrupt</hi> in this <hi>matter,</hi> than they can pretend ours to be: There were not only <hi>Drunkards,</hi> but even an <hi>incestuous Person</hi> in their Communion; and yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> did never advise any to <hi>separate</hi> from them, or to <hi>call</hi> a more <hi>pure</hi> Church out of that Church, but only to <hi>Try</hi> and <hi>Examine themselves,</hi> and so to <hi>receive.</hi> Besides, if any Person be publickly <hi>scanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous,</hi> so as to give <hi>Offence</hi> to the <hi>Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> we know our Rubrick permits him not to <hi>receive,</hi> but orders the Minister to put him back from the <hi>Communion:</hi> Tho' in <hi>large Parishes,</hi> 'tis perhaps <hi>impossible</hi> for him to know every <hi>Person;</hi> and if any be really <hi>scandalized</hi> at another's <hi>wicked Life,</hi> he ought to make the Minister acquainted with it, if he has first <hi>reproved</hi> him himself without Success; and till he has done both these, he has not the least pretence for an Objection on that account against <hi>receiving.</hi> And as this is agreeable to the constant practice of the Church of God, so 'tis also the Opinion of the most sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of those who are <hi>dissatisfied</hi> with some things in our <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion.</hi>

§ XLV. The <hi>Objections</hi> against recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in general being thus, I hope, fully answered, there remains only something like one against <hi>frequent Communion;</hi> and that is, that there's danger lest, as in other things, <hi>Familiarity</hi> breeds <hi>Contempt,</hi> so the <hi>commoness</hi> of this <hi>Sacrament</hi> should take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the <hi>Reverence</hi> due to it: But this is easi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly answered, because the same might be said of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Preaching:</hi> Besides, if it were a good Argument against <hi>frequent Communion</hi> now, it had been so in the <hi>Primitive</hi> times, when they received every day; but this rather encreased than dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished their <hi>Reverence</hi> for the Sacrament, and would do the same by us if we received with that Care that we ought, and with a just Consideration of the <hi>Dignity</hi> of this <hi>sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Ordinance.</hi>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of Examination before the Sacrament, and Preparation for it.</head>
               <p>§ I. WHAT has been said in the former Chapter is by no means intended to disswade Persons from a due <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> before they receive the Holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; it being certain that none ought to come thither without being <hi>habitually prepar'd;</hi> none, if it may be had, without some super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>added <hi>actual Preparation.</hi> He that comes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>former</hi> of these, is certainly without the <hi>Wedding-Garment,</hi> and in danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>bound Hand and Foot, and cast into utter darkness:</hi> He that comes without the <hi>latter</hi> where it may be had, will fall short of that <hi>Comfort</hi> and <hi>Benefit</hi> which he might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise have in this <hi>Holy Ordinance.</hi> It may not therefore be unnecessary to enquire more distinctly into each of these, and to shew wherein they consist.</p>
               <p>§ II. By <hi>habitual Preparation,</hi> is meant, that which is transacted in the entire frame,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:106561:54"/>
the <hi>uniform course</hi> of a <hi>Religious Life.</hi> When a Person has made it the main <hi>Business</hi> of his Life to mortify all ill Habits, and to introduce better in their room; to cleanse himself from all <hi>Filthiness</hi> of Flesh and Spirit, to perform his <hi>Vow</hi> in Baptism, to be sanctified and renewed, to repent and be converted, and Holy as God is Holy. And he that is in this happy Condition, as he is always <hi>fit to die,</hi> so is he <hi>always fit</hi> to receive the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> even tho' he should be hindered from any <hi>actual Preparation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ III. Nor yet does it hence follow that such <hi>actual Preparation</hi> is to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected where it may be had; nay, it is undoubtedly highly useful, and tends very much to the perfection of a <hi>Christian Life.</hi> This <hi>Preparation</hi> chiefly consists in <hi>Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> or the strict trial of our Lives and Conversations by the Rule of God's Word. A due knowledge of the <hi>Nature</hi> of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. the solemn Seal of God's <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with us, and of the Nature of that Covenant, which he has made with us by his Son, is <hi>presupposed</hi> in every Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant: Tho' where any are ignorant of these first <hi>Principles,</hi> they may find some account of them in the first Chapter of this Manual: Nor ought any to presume to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:106561:55"/>
without they have such <hi>knowledge,</hi> however, an equal clearness in these Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters cannot be <hi>expected,</hi> nor is it required from all sorts of People, but a Man shall be accepted according to what he <hi>hath,</hi> if he has made the best of his <hi>Opportunities</hi> of <hi>Knowledge.</hi> And after all, a Person that is truely <hi>humbled</hi> for some degrees of <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> in these and other <hi>spiritual Matters,</hi> is in a much safer Condition, than those whom <hi>Knowledge</hi> puffs up, without either <hi>Humility</hi> or <hi>Charity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ IV. A competent <hi>Knowledge</hi> being presupposed, of the <hi>Nature</hi> of these <hi>Holy Mysteries,</hi> there will not need much proof that some <hi>actual Preparation</hi> is highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite before we receive them. 'Tis true, the <hi>Preparation</hi> of Man's Heart, in this, as well as all other Cases, is from the Lord: But none are so weak, as not to know their <hi>own Endeavours,</hi> are also necessary; <q>we must judge our selves if we would not be judged of the Lord. We must purify our selves before we eat the Passover, for he that presumes to eat it in his uncleanness,</q> that is, <q>without repenting of his Sins, that Soul shall be cut off from among his People.</q> We ought to be <hi>cleansed</hi> according to the <hi>purification</hi> of the <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> and if we have
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:106561:55"/>
done our Endeavours, the good Lord will pardon what is <hi>unavoidably</hi> wanting. <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siah</hi> commanded the <hi>Levites</hi> to <hi>prepare</hi> and <hi>sanctify</hi> themselves, and to <hi>prepare</hi> their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren against that famous <hi>Passover</hi> which was kept in his time. And if Preparation was so <hi>necessary</hi> for the Jewish Passover, we cannot think it altogether needless when we are to partake of this <hi>Christian Feast;</hi> which we ought to keep neither with the <hi>Old Leaven,</hi> of Judaism or Heathenism, or an open notorious wicked Life; neither with the as dangerous Leaven of <hi>malice</hi> and <hi>hypocrisie;</hi> but with the unleavened Bread of <hi>sincerity</hi> and <hi>truth.</hi> Without such <hi>prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,</hi> 
                  <q>we may eat and drink unworthily, kindle God's Wrath against us, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke him to plague us with divers Diseases and sundry kinds of Death.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§ V. But a great part of this <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as has been said, consists in <hi>Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> For how can we know how <hi>Accounts</hi> are between <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>us,</hi> unless we look into them? What our <hi>Debts</hi> are? What Mercies we receive? What we still <hi>want,</hi> and which the best way to obtain them? What Sins we are to <hi>confess,</hi> and to fight against? Where we are to plant our <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries?</hi> Where to expect an <hi>Assault?</hi> What
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:106561:56"/>
the best methods of <hi>Defence?</hi> What <hi>Auxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaries</hi> we want, and where to obtain them? This the Apostle strictly commands every Man to do, to <hi>examine,</hi> or <hi>prove</hi> himself, and so to come to the <hi>Holy Table;</hi> not to <hi>come without Examination,</hi> or to stay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way on pretence of <hi>not being examined.</hi> Something indeed of this Nature is the Practice of every good Christian every <hi>Day</hi> of his Life, (as it has been even of moral Heathens) to <hi>examine</hi> his <hi>Conscience</hi> before he sleeps, what Sins he has that day com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and by what <hi>Steps</hi> he fell into them, and penitently and earnestly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore <hi>Forgiveness</hi> for what's <hi>past,</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> for the future, to do <hi>better:</hi> And 'tis not easie to imagine how any Man should be a <hi>very good Christian</hi> without it; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as whoever does constantly and carefully practise it, (for which he may find excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Directions</hi> among the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions annexed to the <hi>Whole Duty of Man,</hi> and for want of that, there are some Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions added at the End of this Treatise) must needs make a more than ordinary <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress</hi> in Christianity, and will more espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially find a wonderful advantage there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, as to the easiness of his <hi>actual</hi> Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and <hi>Preparation</hi> for the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:106561:56"/>
§ VI. Which <hi>actual Preparation</hi> and Examination immediately before we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceceive are highly requisite, because they may make up for defects in the <hi>habitual,</hi> as being more exact and more <hi>solemn</hi> than our daily <hi>Inquisition</hi> into the State of our Minds. And this may be done with very great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, by setting apart some <hi>one day</hi> in the Week before the Communion, where a Person is at his <hi>own disposal,</hi> and his <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Affairs</hi> will permit him, entirely, for this great <hi>Concern,</hi> in order to <hi>search</hi> and try our ways and turn again to the Lord. This would be near the <hi>End</hi> of the Week, because otherwise the <hi>Impression</hi> made by it, may be apt to wear away again be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> or at least not to be so <hi>deep</hi> and <hi>lively</hi> as at less distance: Nor might it be so convenient to put it off to the very <hi>last</hi> Day of the Week, lest some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing or other should <hi>intervene</hi> and hinder it. But for those who have not really <hi>lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure</hi> for such a <hi>solemn Preparation,</hi> or in the case of an <hi>accidental Communion,</hi> which could not be foreseen; if they are before <hi>habitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prepared,</hi> we have already seen the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of our best Divines, that they ought not to reject such an <hi>Opportunity,</hi> for want of a more solemn <hi>actual Preparation.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:106561:57"/>
he who has but a <hi>little time,</hi> ought to <hi>do his diligence to give of that Little.</hi> A <hi>Servant</hi> or labouring Man, may at least re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem an Hour or two, either in Mornings or Evenings, for this great Work, which they can do for their <hi>worldly Interest,</hi> on any <hi>extraordinary Occasion.</hi> Few have so much Business but they can find time for their <hi>Diversions,</hi> many for their <hi>Sins,</hi> and are our <hi>Souls</hi> only not worth a <hi>few Hours,</hi> which he who bought them so dearly, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures us, are more <hi>worth than all the World?</hi> Besides, most of the following Directions may be observed while a Person is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in many sorts of <hi>Work,</hi> especially in the <hi>Fields,</hi> and concerns of <hi>Husbandry:</hi> And for many <hi>Tradesmen,</hi> they have yet greater leisure, which one would think should be much better filled up this way, than in a shameful <hi>Idleness,</hi> or in what is yet worse, the reading <hi>ill Books,</hi> and <hi>profane</hi> and <hi>immoral Plays,</hi> which scarce ever fail of rendring the <hi>mind,</hi> not only <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>trivial,</hi> but even <hi>averse</hi> to <hi>Piety</hi> and unfit for all the <hi>Offices</hi> of a <hi>Holy Life.</hi> For those who are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally straitned as to <hi>time,</hi> there will be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Directions for <hi>Examination,</hi> and for their Ease, the following Rules are <hi>abbreviated.</hi> But this is not the case of so <hi>many Persons</hi> as plead that Excuse, since we shall frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:106561:57"/>
hear Men complain, that their <hi>Time lies upon their Hands,</hi> and they know not how to employ it: And for such as these, and all those who can command so much <hi>time,</hi> as to go through them, the <hi>larger Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections</hi> which now follow, are chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
               <p>§ VII. When the Day approaches, whereon we expect one <hi>happy Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> more to meet our Saviour at his own <hi>Table,</hi> whose Invitation, by his Ministers, we are to receive with the <hi>greatest Ioy,</hi> and the greatest <hi>Reverence;</hi> the first thing we do, would be to <hi>sequester</hi> our selves from the World, nay, even from all world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and the troublesome <hi>Cares</hi> of Life. To do this with all possible <hi>Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and with the whole force of our Minds, with firm <hi>Resolves</hi> and full <hi>purpose</hi> of Heart, not to admit any other Business, any other Thoughts, unsuitable to this great Work. Which having begun with devout Prayer for the Divine Assistance, let us proceed in the impartial <hi>Examen</hi> of our <hi>Consciences</hi> on the following Heads. 1. Of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> 2. <hi>Holy Resolutions.</hi> 3. <hi>Faith.</hi> 4. <hi>Thankfulness.</hi> And 5. <hi>Charity.</hi> All which if we find in some good degree wrought
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:106561:58"/>
in us by God's <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach with comfort to this Sacrament.</p>
               <p>§ VIII. And first: We are to <hi>examine</hi> our selves concerning our <hi>Repentance;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the <hi>Nature</hi> of it consists, whether <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual</hi> or <hi>actual;</hi> and under actual Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, may be included our particular Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination by the Rule of <hi>God's Commands,</hi> before we approach the Sacrament.</p>
               <p>The general Nature of <hi>Repentance,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in a thorough <hi>Change of Heart and Life, so as to hate all Sin,</hi> and <hi>turn</hi> to God; to <hi>love</hi> God more than the <hi>World,</hi> or our Lusts, or even, than our own <hi>Lives,</hi> in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing <hi>bent,</hi> the settled <hi>Choice</hi> of our Minds, and to evidence this by <hi>keeping</hi> his <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments:</hi> To live in the course of no <hi>greater Sin,</hi> such as Drunkenness, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Uncleanness, <hi>neglect</hi> of <hi>Publick Worship,</hi> or the like; which <hi>waste</hi> the <hi>Conscience,</hi> and are a perfect <hi>Contradiction</hi> to true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and must be left immediately, as we would avoid eternal Misery: not to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge</hi> so much as Sins of <hi>Infirmity,</hi> nor to say, <hi>is it not a little one?</hi> such as sloth, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, forgetfulness of our Duty in some Instances, wandring Thoughts, or the like: for a Christian is to fight against <hi>all Sin,</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="tcp:106561:58"/>
and such as are at <hi>first</hi> comparatively <hi>little,</hi> yet do all deserve God's Anger, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Punishments, and will if they are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, grow bigger, and at last perhaps, irresistible.

               </p>
               <p>§ IX. <hi>Actual Repentance,</hi> is that which every good Man puts in practice on his <hi>falling</hi> into any <hi>Sin;</hi> and which he should <hi>renew</hi> more particularly and exactly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he comes to the Lord's Table; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto we are directed in the first Exhortation on the <hi>Sunday</hi> before the Communion, which we would therefore do very well seriously to <hi>peruse,</hi> in order to our Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for it. Wherein we are taught, <q>That 'tis our Duty to search and examine our own Consciences, and that not light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and after the manner of Dissemblers with God, but so as that we may come Holy and Clean to this heavenly Feast.</q>
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:106561:60"/>
And we are further directed to do this, <q>by the Rule of God's <hi>Commands,</hi> and whereinsoever we shall perceive our selves to have offended, either by Will, Word or Deed, there to bewail our own sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness, and to confess our selves to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.</q> And to assist us herein, we may find large and exact <hi>Catalogues</hi> of <hi>Sins</hi> in several Books of Devotion, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly those annexed to the <hi>Whole Duty of Man;</hi> which if you have not, you may if you please, make use of this <hi>following,</hi> and examine your self concerning the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Breaches</hi> of God's <hi>Commands,</hi> either of the first or second Table.</p>
               <p>§ X. The Breaches of the <hi>first Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> of the first Table, are; 1.

Supreme;</hi> there can be but <hi>One God,</hi> (tho' Three Persons,) who is <hi>over all, blessed for ever.</hi> 3. <hi>Covetousness,</hi> which is <hi>Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> Immoderate Love of our selves, or of the World, that <hi>Carnal-mindedness,</hi> which is <hi>Death.</hi> A violent and unreasonable <hi>Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> for any <hi>Person</hi> or <hi>Thing</hi> in this World. 4. Wilful <hi>Ignorance</hi> of God or of his Word; carelessness of our Souls, neglecting or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising Instruction. 5. <hi>Presumption</hi> upon God's Mercy. A <hi>false Peace</hi> and Security in Sin. As on the other side, <hi>distrusting</hi> his Power or Goodness, or <hi>murmuring</hi> against him, or <hi>despairing</hi> of his Mercy. 6. Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping <hi>Angels</hi> or Saints. 7. Witchcraft, or doing interpretative Homage to the <hi>Devil,</hi> by using <hi>Charms,</hi> consulting with <hi>Wizards,</hi> cunning Men and the like; which is esteemed by our greatest Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, a degree of renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing our Christianity. <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>The Breaches of the <hi>second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,</hi> are; 1. <hi>Idolatry,</hi> which is making any Images with intent to <hi>bow</hi> down to

Want of inward <hi>spiritual Worship,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which, the <hi>outward</hi> is but like a dead Carcass; (tho' this may be referred also to the first Command.)</p>

The Breaches of the <hi>third Command,</hi> are; 1. Taking God's <hi>Name</hi> in <hi>vain</hi> (which those who do are particularly branded as God's <hi>Enemies,</hi>

               <p>For the <hi>sixth:</hi> 1. The <hi>direct Breach</hi> of it is <hi>Murder,</hi> the old Version, Thou shalt do no <hi>Murder,</hi> being better than the New, <q>thou shalt not <hi>Kill;</hi>
                  </q> for all know that all <hi>killing</hi> is not <hi>murder,</hi> nor is it unlawful, as in a just <hi>War,</hi> or the like: But <hi>murder</hi> is killing without, or against <hi>Law,</hi> or by a wrested pretence of <hi>Law,</hi> worse than all the rest.

Want of <hi>Meekness,</hi> and Forgiveness, and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Compassion towards our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour.</p>

               <p>The direct Breach of the <hi>eighth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> is, <hi>Stealing,</hi> either <hi>open,</hi> and forcibly,

which is <hi>Robbery;</hi> or private, which is <hi>These</hi> and <hi>Pilfering;</hi> and so is injuring our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour by pretence of <hi>Law,</hi> by Extortion, by Oppression, by unequal laying of <hi>Taxes,</hi> or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise. 3. <hi>Cheating</hi> in <hi>Trade;</hi> false Lights, Weights, Coin, Measures, Imposing on our Neighbour in Buying or Selling, Lying, to raise the Price of Goods. 4. Denying, detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or delaying the <hi>Hire of the Labourer,</hi> or les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sening, or raising it beyond a just proportion. 5. <hi>Living extravagantly,</hi> not proportioning <hi>Expences</hi> to <hi>Incoms,</hi> thence running into un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary <hi>Debts</hi> without an <hi>honest Care,</hi> and greatest <hi>Diligence</hi> to discharge them. 6.

taking up an <hi>evil Report</hi> against him, or spreading <hi>malicious Truth,</hi> or any way <hi>speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ill</hi> of him, unless when God's <hi>Glory,</hi> or our own <hi>Reputation,</hi> or another's <hi>Welfare</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. 4. <hi>Uncharitable Censures,</hi> deriding or exposing any one's Infirmities. 5. <hi>Tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing</hi> and whispering, the Vice of mean and ignoble Souls. 6. <hi>Dissembling,</hi> Flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and Lying. 7.

               <p>In the <hi>tenth,</hi> are forbidden; 1. The <hi>desiring</hi> any. thing that's my Neighbour's, without a <hi>just Compensation,</hi> or where he is not <hi>willing</hi> to part with it. 2. <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content</hi> and <hi>repining</hi> at our own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, or <hi>envying</hi> our Neighbours. 3. The first allowed pleasing <hi>motions</hi> to any Sin, especially to <hi>Impurity,</hi> or delightful <hi>Reflections</hi> on past Wickedness.</p>
               <p>§ XII. Thus much for the chief Breaches of God's Commands, upon all of which, we would do well distinctly to <hi>examine</hi> our selves in our <hi>Preparation</hi> for the Sacrament, especially, as to those Sins whereunto we have formerly found our selves most <hi>strongly inclined,</hi> and whereof we have been most <hi>frequently guilty.</hi> We ought also to reflect on all the <hi>Aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>

of them, how frequently, how inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusably, against how much <hi>Goodness</hi> and Patience of God, how many <hi>checks</hi> of our own Conscience, and perhaps, <hi>advice</hi> of Friends, against how many <hi>Vows</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions</hi> we have committed them.

And if we do not yet find our Hearts sufficiently <hi>affected</hi> for it, if the <hi>Love</hi> of Christ and all his Sufferings for us, cannot <hi>melt</hi> us into an ingenious Sorrow for our Offences, let us consider God's dreadful <hi>Iudgment,</hi> his terrible Indignation against <hi>impenitent Sinners,</hi> and earnestly pray to God, for the sake of his dear Son, to take away our <hi>stony Hearts,</hi> and give us that <hi>godly Sorrow which works Repentance</hi> to Salvation. And proportionable to our <hi>Sins,</hi> must be our <hi>Sorrow</hi> and our Repentance, tho' here it may be necessary to interpose a Caution: There are some pious Persons of such <hi>weak Iudgments,</hi> and tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences, that they are, it may be, ready to <hi>accuse</hi> themselves of <hi>many Sins,</hi> whereof they were never <hi>guilty:</hi> But we must not <hi>lie to God,</hi> nor <hi>belie</hi> our selves, nor <hi>charge our

selves,</hi> any more than charge God, <hi>foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> And where we find in our Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that God has <hi>preserved</hi> us from any Sins, or given us more Strength against any which have formerly been too hard for us, we ought not by any means to be <hi>unthank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> for his Goodness, but ascribe all to him, and praise him for his Grace, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour so well to improve it, and those <hi>Talents</hi> which we have, that he may still bestow more upon us, and make us perfect in <hi>Repentance</hi> and all good Works.</p>
               <p>§ XIII. Having thus strictly <hi>examined</hi> our selves concerning our Breaches of God's <hi>Commands,</hi> and our serious effectual <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> for them, we proceed in the next place, to firm and <hi>Holy Resolves</hi> to do bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for the future; to avoid those <hi>Evils</hi> we have faln into, to perform those <hi>Duties</hi> we have hitherto neglected. We are to <hi>ask</hi> our selves in the <hi>presence</hi> of God, whether we do indeed, <q>stedfastly <hi>purpose</hi> to lead a <hi>new Life,</hi> without which, 'tis the highest <hi>presumption</hi> to approach these <hi>dreadful My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries:</hi>
                  </q> And accordingly, we are actually to make most solemn <hi>Vows,</hi> as well as <hi>Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> of better Obedience: The force of <hi>Resolution</hi> only, is not small, it gives new Strength and <hi>Energy</hi> to the mind, and
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:106561:66"/>
helps to perform what one would think at first sight almost <hi>impossible: Bodily Diseases,</hi> we are told, have been cured by it, which have been thought <hi>desperate,</hi> and why may not also Diseases of the Mind. There is a <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in Man,</hi> and 'tis the Breath of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, and it has a <hi>noble Force,</hi> if we will but stir it up, and make use of it: But when <hi>Vows</hi> are added to these <hi>Resolves,</hi> when we <hi>resolve</hi> in God's <hi>Name,</hi> and in his <hi>Sight,</hi> and thro' his Strength, and by the Assistance of his <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> earnestly and faithfully for it, and conscientiously use the <hi>means</hi> to obtain it, to <hi>avoid</hi> Sin, to encrease in <hi>Goodness;</hi> all these make such a <hi>Cord</hi> as is not easily broken. Nor are we to be discouraged from making <hi>New Resolves,</hi> because we may have <hi>broken</hi> such as we have formerly made: No, we are to be troubled for our <hi>Fall,</hi> but not to lie still in the <hi>Dirt,</hi> but to rise immediately, and endeavour to <hi>recover</hi> the <hi>Ground</hi> we have <hi>lost,</hi> in our way towards Heaven: We are to observe what was the <hi>occasion</hi> of our <hi>stumbling,</hi> how we came to <hi>break</hi> our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer <hi>Resolves</hi> against our Sins. If it was <hi>ill Company</hi> that led us into it, we are careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the future, as much as possible, to <hi>avoid</hi> such Company, as we value the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> of God, and our own eternal Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:106561:67"/>
And so if <hi>Love of this World</hi> have made us neglect our <hi>Duty</hi> to God, or our Neighbour, we are to resolve against <hi>that;</hi> actually to <hi>draw</hi> off our <hi>Minds</hi> from these perishing Objects, and fix them on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fading <hi>Treasures</hi> of a better World. And thus are we particularly to <hi>level</hi> our Holy Resolutions against those <hi>Sins</hi> which do most <hi>easily beset</hi> us, most <hi>frequently</hi> prevail over us; solemnly, upon our Knees, before God, to <hi>Renounce</hi> those Works of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, or to renew that Solemn <hi>Renunciation</hi> of them, which we made in our <hi>Baptism,</hi> as well as to renew those Sacred <hi>Vows</hi> which we then made to <hi>keep God's Holy Will and Commandment, and to walk in the same all the Days of our Lives.</hi> Which will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have a very great <hi>Influence</hi> on our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Actions, to preserve us from <hi>running</hi> upon any <hi>Temptation</hi> to our former Sins, or from the neglect of our Duty; but will be also by God's Grace, a mighty <hi>Guard</hi> upon us, even when we are actually tempted; the <hi>Impression</hi> of those good <hi>Resolves</hi> being still <hi>deep</hi> and fresh on our Minds, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them a strong <hi>tendency</hi> to Good, and <hi>aversion</hi> to Evil, and the horrid Guilt of <hi>Perjury</hi> appearing before our Eyes, if we should again break God's Commands: Nor had the Psalmist himself any stronger Guard
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:106561:67"/>
against <hi>Temptation</hi> than the Sense of his <hi>Vows,</hi> and the awful <hi>presence</hi> of that God to whom he had made them. <hi>Psal.</hi> 16. 8. <q>
                     <hi>I have set the Lord always before my Face, that I might not sin against him.</hi>
                  </q> And, Psal. 119. 106. <q>I have sworn, and am sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly purposed to keep thy righteous Iudgments.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§ XIV. The third thing concerning which we are to examine our selves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we approach this <hi>Holy Table,</hi> is, <q>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we have a <hi>lively Faith</hi> in God's Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy thro' Christ.</q> Not a dead, cold, and unactive, but a <hi>lively Faith;</hi> for, <q>Faith without Works is dead:</q> and such is the ungrounded fatal <hi>Presumption</hi> of every <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Sinner;</hi> for what is more common than for <hi>bad Men,</hi> who live in direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to our Saviour's Laws, in repea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Acts of Intemperance, Injustice, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness, immoderate Love to this World, and in the neglect of their Duty, of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of God's Word and Sacrament; What is more common than to hear such mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken Wretches as these cry out, that <hi>God is merciful,</hi> that <hi>Christ has died,</hi> and they hope to be saved, tho' they bring forth no <hi>Fruits</hi> meet for <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Repentance?</hi> They <hi>believe</hi> the Promise of the Gospel, tho' they never take care to perform the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:106561:68"/>
of it: But they <hi>forget,</hi> or are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly ignorant that it contains <hi>threatnings</hi> too, and that very <hi>terrible</hi> ones against the <hi>Impenitent</hi> and <hi>Disobedient;</hi> and that Christ himself has told such, that he'll say to them at the last day, <q>Depart from me, I never knew you, because <hi>Workers of Iniquity.</hi>
                  </q> But the true <hi>lively Faith</hi> here required is, <q>Such a <hi>Belief</hi> of God's <hi>Word,</hi> and such a <hi>Trust</hi> in his <hi>Mercy,</hi> thro' his Promises by our <hi>Saviour,</hi> as produces a constant and ingenuous <hi>Obedience.</hi>
                  </q> Now if we find this <hi>Faith</hi> weak and <hi>languishing,</hi> we must pray as the Disciples did, <q>Lord <hi>encrease our Faith!</hi>
                  </q> And to that End, we must consider the Promises of God unto us, for the <hi>sake</hi> of his dear Son our Lord, in whom <q>all the Promises are <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> ratified and certain.</q> In <hi>whom alone</hi> the <hi>Father is well pleased,</hi> by the Merits, of whose <hi>Obedience</hi> and <hi>Sufferings,</hi> his Satisfaction, his Intercession and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diation, he is <hi>reconciled</hi> to lost Mankind, and offers <hi>Pardon</hi> to all that are penitent and obedient. And this is <q>
                     <hi>all our Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and all our <hi>Desire;</hi>
                  </q> the Hope of Holy Souls, the Ground of their <hi>Consolation</hi> and their <hi>Triumph,</hi> which are fixed so firmly upon that <hi>Rock of Ages,</hi> that they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be moved; who has told us, <q>That
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:106561:68"/>
if we <hi>believe</hi> in <hi>God,</hi> we must believe also in <hi>him,</hi> as the <hi>means</hi> of conveying all the Father's <hi>blessings;</hi> nay, as being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, as he is, God, the <hi>Author</hi> and <hi>Finisher</hi> of our <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </q> Whence it follows, that he himself, the <hi>second Person</hi> of the glorious <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> may, and ought to be the <hi>object</hi> of our Trust, our <hi>Faith,</hi> and our Adoration, both in this Life, and in the <hi>hour of Death,</hi> as he was of blessed St. <hi>Steven</hi>'s who cried out in his <hi>last Agonies,</hi> 
                  <q>Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus! receive my Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</q> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 7. 59.</note> And thus in our <hi>preparation</hi> for the Holy Sacrament, without the reception whereof, I see not how any can <hi>live</hi> comfortably, or <hi>die</hi> happily, we must actually <hi>advert</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, deeply and seriously <hi>consider</hi> those <hi>Promises</hi> which God has made us by his Son, of <hi>Grace</hi> and Pardon, on our Repentance and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: <q>That those who come to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>by him,</hi> he will in no wise cast out.</q> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> 6. 37. <q>That they shall not see Death, but are passed from Death unto Life.</q> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> 8. 51. 5. 24. <q>That there is no <hi>condemnation for them which are in Christ Iesus,</hi> and who those are, we are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately told, <hi>who walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit.</hi>
                  </q> Rom. 8. 1. <q>That all who are <hi>weary</hi> and heavy laden with the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:106561:69"/>
Burthen of their <hi>Sins,</hi> if they come unto him, he will <hi>refresh</hi> them;</q> St. <hi>Matt.</hi> 11. 28. and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others of the same nature; the substance of the <hi>Gospel</hi> being <hi>promises</hi> of eternal Life to those who yield a <hi>sincere,</hi> and <hi>impartial,</hi> tho' not absolutely <hi>sinless</hi> and <hi>perfect</hi> obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to the <hi>Commands</hi> of it; all the <hi>threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings</hi> thereof, being only the unavoidable <hi>Consequences</hi> of wilfully rejecting it. Now the very Nature of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> shows the necessity of <hi>Faith</hi> towards worthy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving; for how can we <hi>renew</hi> our <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant</hi> with God, unless we <hi>believe</hi> he's real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>willing</hi> to be <hi>reconciled</hi> to us, and have a firm <hi>Faith</hi> in his <hi>Truth,</hi> his <hi>Power</hi> and his <hi>Goodness?</hi> And how could we have any well grounded <hi>hopes</hi> of Pardon, but from the <hi>Revelation</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> and by the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> of a Redeemer? And to the exercise of this Grace, the <hi>Church</hi> also directs us when we approach this Holy Table, requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us, <q>to have a lively and stedfast <hi>Faith</hi>
                  </q> in Christ our Saviour; and so in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, the <hi>Sunday</hi> before the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <q>that 'tis requisite that those who come thither, should have a <hi>full Trust</hi> in God's Mercy.</q> Not that all are required to have the same <hi>degrees</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi> for there are doubtless different <hi>measures</hi> of it as in the <hi>Resurrection, one Star</hi> shall differ
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:106561:69"/>
from another in <hi>Glory:</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 43. But our <hi>Faith</hi> ought certainly to be so <hi>strong</hi> as to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our <hi>Infidelity,</hi> to <hi>over come</hi> the World: It is to be <hi>sincere,</hi> and then it will not want <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance,</hi> tho' it be but as a <hi>Grain</hi> of <hi>Mustard-Seed,</hi> for our gracious Lord has promised that he will not <hi>break the bruised Reed,</hi> nor quench the <hi>smoaking Flax:</hi> St. <hi>Matt.</hi> 12. 20. Tho' we are always to press forward, that this as well as all other <hi>Graces</hi> may still be <hi>encreased,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which, nothing can more highly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, than the frequent and devout reception of this <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XV. The 4th. thing concerning which we are to <hi>examine</hi> our selves in our prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is, whether we have [a <hi>thankful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance</hi> of <hi>Christ's Death;]</hi> whereunto the Church directs us in such <hi>pathetical</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions as were scarce ever <hi>excelled,</hi> and I question whether <hi>equalled</hi> in any other <hi>Liturgy;</hi> tho' not only the antient Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but our Protestant Brethren, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the <hi>French,</hi> and the <hi>Tigurine,</hi> have excellent <hi>Forms</hi> on this occasion: I mean that passage where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are exhorted <note n="*" place="margin">Exhortation at the time of the celebration.</note> 
                  <q>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things to give most humble and hearty <hi>Thanks</hi> to God the Father, the Son, and
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:106561:70"/>
the Holy Ghost, for the <hi>Redemption</hi> of the World by the Death and Passion of our Saviour Christ, both <hi>GOD</hi> and <hi>Man;</hi> who did humble himself even to the Death, upon the Cross, for us miserable Sinners; who lay in darkness and the shadow of Death, that he might make us the Children of God, and exalt us to everlasting Life.</q> This we are to do <hi>[above all things]</hi> because this true and unfeigned <hi>Gratitude</hi> is the principal Ornament of the <hi>Wedding-Garment.</hi> This seems to have been the <hi>chief</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> End of the <hi>Institution,</hi> 
                  <q>Do this in <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance</hi>
                  </q> of me; and <q>hereby ye <hi>shew forth</hi>
                  </q> the Lord's Death till he come: And how is it possible for any ingenuous mind to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member,</hi> to <hi>reflect</hi> upon our Saviour's suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, without the most tender <hi>Resentments,</hi> the highest Thankfulness and Love? For how can a Rebel be fit for <hi>Pardon,</hi> if he is not <hi>thankful</hi> when 'tis offered him? 'Tis therefore necessary that we should so long, so seriously remember the exceeding great Love of our Master, and only Saviour thus dying for us, even before we come to the Solemn Sacramental Commemoration of it, till our Hearts <hi>burn</hi> within us, as did the <hi>two Disciples,</hi> that we may thereby be in some measure fitted to <hi>meet</hi> our Saviour, and that he may make himself known unto
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:106561:70"/>
us, as he did unto them, <hi>in breaking of Bread:</hi> St. <hi>Luke</hi> 24. 32. But we must take care that this Remembrance have a <hi>future</hi> lasting <hi>influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> on our Lives: <hi>Ill Men</hi> may <hi>remember</hi> Christ's Death, but it's certain that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may pretend, they do it <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuously,</hi> not <hi>thankfully,</hi> because it is not productive of a <hi>Holy Life.</hi> It makes them nothing <hi>better,</hi> but rather encourages them to go on in their Sins; whereas true <hi>thankfulness</hi> will naturally produce unfeigned Obedience: And to make us both <hi>obedient</hi> and <hi>thankful,</hi> one would think there should need no more than to consider deeply from what <hi>Evils</hi> Christ has <hi>saved</hi> us by his Death; no less than the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> the <hi>Wrath</hi> of God, and everlasting <hi>Misery:</hi> And what <hi>Benefits</hi> he has obtained for us by it; the <hi>Pardon</hi> of Sin, the <hi>Favour</hi> of God, <hi>Grace</hi> to serve him, and <hi>eternal Happiness;</hi> some of which are actually <hi>conveyed,</hi> as all of them are <hi>assur'd</hi> and <hi>seal'd</hi> in this blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to every penitent, faithful, grateful Receiver.</p>
               <p>§ XV. The last thing necessary to a <hi>worthy Communicant,</hi> is <hi>Charity.</hi> [<q>To be in <hi>Charity</hi> with <hi>all Men.]</hi> When we bring our Gift to the Altar, we must be first <hi>reconciled</hi> to our <hi>Brother:</hi>
                  </q> We must offer
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:106561:71"/>
it, and sincerely <hi>desire</hi> and <hi>endeavour</hi> it; and if he <hi>refuses</hi> to be reconciled, the Fault is on his side, nor ought <hi>another's Crime</hi> to keep us from our <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Happiness.</hi> This <hi>Charity</hi> must also show it self in an universal <hi>Love</hi> to Mankind, wishing, pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, endeavouring, and as much as in us lies, promoting their temporal and spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Welfare.</hi> But especially, this <hi>Holy Love</hi> is to be acted and exercised towards <hi>all Christians,</hi> and particularly towards those with whom we <hi>communicate;</hi> not forgetting the <hi>Poor,</hi> whom we are to <hi>relieve,</hi> as well at the <hi>Offering,</hi> which ought not to be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected at the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as any other way that lies in our Power. The exercise of this <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> is more eminently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary when we approach to this <hi>blessed Feast,</hi> because 'twas <hi>one great End</hi> of its Institution; it being designed to increase <hi>Christian Unity,</hi> and <hi>Holy Love</hi> among the Faithful, who herein communicate both in temporal and spiritual good things; who Feast and make a <hi>Covenant</hi> with each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as well as with the great <hi>Inviter;</hi> 
                  <q>and being many are hereby made one <hi>Body</hi> and one <hi>Bread.</hi>
                  </q> 1 Cor. 10. 17.</p>
               <p>We are therefore carefully to <hi>examine</hi> our selves before we come thither, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we heartily forgive our <hi>Enemies,</hi> and
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:106561:71"/>
are ready to <hi>render Good for Evil?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we feel this Divine <hi>Flame</hi> in our Hearts, and dearly <hi>love</hi> all those that bear the <hi>Image of the heavenly?</hi> And in order to produce in us both <hi>parts</hi> of this Grace, one would think we should need do no more than con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider seriously how many <hi>Talents</hi> our Lord has <hi>forgiven</hi> us; how much he has <hi>done</hi> and <hi>suffered</hi> for us, even while we were his <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies;</hi> and that we are all <hi>Members of one Body,</hi> whereof <hi>Christ</hi> is the <hi>Head.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XVII. And thus have we finished what relates to our <hi>Preparation</hi> for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and those several <hi>Graces</hi> concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning which we are to <hi>examine</hi> our selves before we approach unto it: <hi>Repentance,</hi> attended by <hi>good Resolves, Faith, Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness,</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> Not that we should forbear to come thither, if we do not find all these in the utmost <hi>perfection;</hi> but where we find any of them <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>languid,</hi> we must <hi>strengthen the things that remain,</hi> and be <hi>humbled</hi> for our <hi>Imperfections,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour earnestly after <hi>higher degrees</hi> of Grace, and consider the <hi>means</hi> appointed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease them, especially the <hi>Holy Sacrament,</hi> wherein they are to be all <hi>exercised</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed,</hi> as will appear in the next Chapter. And in the mean time, most humbly and
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:106561:72"/>
devoutly to fall upon our Knees, and in the following, or any bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Forms <note n="*" place="margin">See the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Devotions added to the <hi>Whole Duty of Man,</hi> or those in the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Sacrifice.</hi>
                  </note> of Prayer, thus address our selves to the <hi>Giver</hi> of all good things, for a Supply of our Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>ALmighty and most merciful Father! who mayst for my Sins be most just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly displeased with me, for ever cast me off from thy presence, and condemn me to Everlasting Misery. I am ashamed, O Lord, and blush to lift up my Face un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, for all my misdeeds are before thee, and my most secret Sins in the Light of thy Countenance. I was shapen in Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and conceived in Sin; by Nature dead in trespasses and sins, averse to Good, and violently inclined to Evil; ignorant of God, and an Enemy to him, in a lost and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done Condition, and utterly unable to help and to deliver my self. And I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to this Original Sin many hainous
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:106561:72"/>
actual Trangressions, <hi>[Here let the Penitent repeat those Sins whereof, on the former Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, he has found himself guilty.]</hi> The <hi>Remembrance</hi> of all which, I desire may be most <hi>grievous</hi> as their <hi>burden</hi> is most <hi>intolerable</hi> unto me; for I have done all these abominations, with many <hi>aggravating Circumstances,</hi> which have highly encreased the Guilt of them; without regard to thy ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Mercies, or to thy terrible Judgments, or to my own repeated <hi>Vows</hi> and Resolves of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and Obedience. O make me to <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor</hi> them, and my self for them, and to repent in Dust and Ashes. I know that my <hi>sorrow</hi> for them is no <hi>satisfaction</hi> to thy offended Justice; yet since thou dost require it of me, to render me capable of thy Mercy, work in me, I beseech thee, by thy Holy Spirit, such a true and unfeigned <hi>Remorse</hi> for them, that I may entirely forsake them, and come Pure and Holy to thy Heavenly Feast. O God be merciful to me a Sinner, who cry unto thee in an acceptable Time, and in the Day of Salvation! <hi>O Holy, Blessed and Glorious Trinity, Three Persons and One God, have mercy upon me a miserable Sinner!</hi> O God the Father of Heaven, who didst send thine Only Son out of thy Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som to tast Death for every Man, that we might not die eternally; accept his Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:106561:73"/>
accept his Intercession, and be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto me thro' his Blood. In my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's House is Bread enough and to spare: O let me not perish with Hunger. O <hi>Son of</hi> David <hi>have mercy on me,</hi> and if thou canst <hi>do any thing,</hi> since thou canst do <hi>all things,</hi> help me. <hi>By thine Agony and bloody Sweat, by thy Cross and Passion, by thy precious Death and Burial, Good Lord deliver me!</hi> I desire not to be saved from the <hi>Guilt</hi> of my Sins only, or from those heavy <hi>Punishments</hi> that are due unto them, but from their <hi>Power</hi> and prevailing Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on my Mind: from <hi>all</hi> my Sins, even those which have been most dear unto me; and am willing to cut off my <hi>Right Hand,</hi> or pluck out my <hi>Right Eye,</hi> so I may but enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. My Saviour came to <hi>take away the Sins of the World;</hi> He has born all our Griefs, he has carried our Sorrows; he was wounded for our Transgressions; he was grieved for our Iniquities; he has <hi>excepted</hi> none out of that <hi>General Pardon</hi> which he has purchased for Mankind, and offered to all those, who are qualified for receiving it. I <hi>present</hi> the <hi>Merits</hi> of his <hi>inestimable Sacrifice</hi> before thee, O offended Majesty of Heaven! I have no <hi>Merits</hi> of my own; <hi>I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I am nothing,</hi> but vile Dust and
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:106561:73"/>
Sin: But he is worthy, for whose sake I beg <hi>Mercy</hi> of thee, which I most humbly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore and expect, only in that <hi>way</hi> which thou hast appointed, and on those <hi>Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> which thy Son has revealed in his Holy Gospel; by an unfeigned <hi>Repentance,</hi> a firm <hi>Faith,</hi> a sincere, and an impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial <hi>Obedience.</hi> O therefore take away all mine Iniquities and receive me graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously, who like the <hi>Prodigal,</hi> desire to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to my <hi>Father's House.</hi> And since 'tis thou alone who dost both <hi>put</hi> into our Minds <hi>good Desires,</hi> and canst also give us <hi>Grace</hi> to perform the same, assist me now and ever in those Holy <hi>Resolves</hi> which I make of new and better Obedience. Vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe me thy Grace to <hi>avoid</hi> all those <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions</hi> and <hi>Temptations,</hi> whereby I have been too often drawn to Evil. Let thy <hi>Blessed Spirit</hi> evermore comfort and guide me, and lead me into all <hi>Truth,</hi> and all <hi>Goodness.</hi> Let me henceforth Evidence my unfeigned <hi>Love</hi> to my Saviour, by <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> his <hi>Commandments;</hi> and let that and all other Graces be <hi>excited</hi> and encreased in me at this Time in my approaches to his Holy Table. Pardon the frivolous and sinful <hi>Excuses</hi> which I have too often made for my <hi>Absence</hi> from it; my want of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi> for it; the <hi>Deadness</hi> and Indevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:106561:74"/>
of my Soul in receiving it; and my shameful <hi>Unprofitableness</hi> by it! O that I may now sit under my Saviour's <hi>shadow</hi> with great <hi>Delight,</hi> and that his Fruit may be sweet unto my Taste: That I may in this Sacrament, receive greater <hi>Strength</hi> than ever against my Sins, and be thereby nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up unto Everlasting Life; that so after this painful Life is ended, I may sit down with <hi>Abraham, Isaac</hi> and <hi>Iacob</hi> in the Kingdom of Heaven; for the sake of Jesus Christ, who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver lives to make Intercession for us, in whose most perfect Form of Word, I conclude my unworthy and imperfect Prayers, saying.</p>

                  <p>O LORD, who hast told us, that <hi>all our doings without Charity are nothing worth,</hi> pour into my Heart, I beseech thee, the most excellent Gift of Charity, that I may love thee above all things, and love my Neighbour as my self.

<pb n="141" facs="tcp:106561:78"/>
                     <hi>Lord's Day</hi> as short as they can, and indulge their <hi>Sloth</hi> and <hi>Idleness</hi> on the <hi>Day</hi> more than on any other. But so will not the <hi>pious Christian,</hi> especially when he designs and desires to be a <hi>Worthy Communicant;</hi> but considers the great <hi>Advantages</hi> of being early at his <hi>Devotions,</hi> before his Mind be filled or diverted by any other <hi>Object;</hi> and that wonderful <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Life,</hi> which it adds to his <hi>Meditations</hi> and <hi>Prayers,</hi> when his Mind is thus <hi>fresh</hi> and <hi>vigorous,</hi> his Body refresht by <hi>rest</hi> and <hi>sleep,</hi> and his Spirits <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created</hi> and <hi>révived;</hi> when he sees and hears all the <hi>Creation</hi> round him praising <hi>God:</hi> with whom he may joyn, and make it his first happy <hi>Employment</hi> to <hi>sing</hi> his <hi>Praises;</hi> either in the Lxiii <hi>Psalm, O God my gracious God,</hi> &amp;c. the five first Verses.

As for <hi>eating,</hi> or <hi>not eating</hi> any thing the Morning before we <hi>receive,</hi> 'tis a thing in it self <hi>indifferent,</hi> and therefore must be determined according to the <hi>Constitution</hi> of the <hi>Communicant.</hi> If a Person be <hi>strong</hi> and <hi>healthy,</hi> and finds no

               <p>§ I. WHEN the <hi>pious Communicant</hi> is <hi>going</hi> to the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and more nearly approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his <hi>Holy Table,</hi> he ought to keep <hi>his Heart</hi> with <hi>all Diligence;</hi> steddily to fix his <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and <hi>Intentions,</hi> and <hi>Expectations,</hi> and all little enough, considering the <hi>sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty</hi> and <hi>vigilance</hi> of his <hi>Adversary,</hi> who, as he does all he can to <hi>hinder</hi> Men from <hi>coming</hi> to this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> so doubtless he will not be wanting in his Endeavours to <hi>disturb</hi> them when they come, and obstruct their <hi>profiting</hi> by it and <hi>happiness</hi> in it. If we have any <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> in our way thither, it ought to be only such as that in the 122 <hi>Psalm,</hi> which is thought to have been repeated by the <hi>pious Worshippers</hi> of old, when going up to <hi>offer</hi> at the <hi>Temple</hi> in <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> In the first and second Verse. <hi>I was glad when they said unto me, let us go into the House of
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:106561:80"/>
the Lord. Our Feet shall stand in thy Gates O Ierusalem.</hi> Now as this <hi>accurate Care,</hi> and <hi>steady Intention</hi> of mind is highly neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary when we <hi>approach</hi> the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> so is it more particularly and eminently need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful when we draw near to the <hi>Holy Table:</hi> If we suffer our <hi>Words,</hi> our <hi>Eyes,</hi> or even our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> to wander in our way thither, we shall find it very difficult, and next to impossible to retain those good <hi>Dispositions,</hi> which we brought with us from our <hi>private Devotions,</hi> or even to <hi>retrieve</hi> them when we are present at the place, and in the <hi>Act of Worship.</hi> And indeed, this seems to be the very Reason why we are so often <hi>disturbed</hi> with <hi>wandring Thoughts</hi> in God's Service, and find so little <hi>Comfort</hi> or <hi>Benefit</hi> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the highest <hi>Acts</hi> of it, because we are seldom upon our <hi>Guard</hi> in our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to it. A <hi>Prudent Christian</hi> will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be so far from indulging himself in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable <hi>Discourse</hi> or <hi>wandring Thoughts</hi> when he is coming to this <hi>heavenly Banquet</hi> that as soon as he is <hi>entred</hi> the <hi>House of God,</hi> he will fall on his <hi>Knees,</hi> and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge his glorious <hi>Presence,</hi> who inhabit therein, and humbly implore his <hi>Assistance</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>retire deeply</hi> into himself, and endeavour to <hi>compose</hi> his Mind to such a <hi>devout Frame</hi> as may some way qualifie him

to <hi>meet</hi> his Saviour and receive a <hi>Blessing</hi> from him.</p>
               <p>§ II. Which leads to our <hi>Behaviour</hi> du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the <hi>actual Celebration</hi> of this <hi>Sacrament.</hi> And after the most strict and impartial <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry</hi> into the useful <hi>Labors</hi> of good Men on this Subject, one must be forced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that nothing can be found so <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat</hi> so <hi>rational,</hi> and so <hi>moving,</hi> as those <hi>Exhortations</hi> and <hi>Directions</hi> which the <hi>Church</hi> has provided on this occasion, in her <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion-Service;</hi> containing the <hi>Quintesence</hi> of all the ancient <hi>Offices,</hi> and carrying so much of the Primitive <hi>Simplicity, Gravity,</hi> and <hi>Piety</hi> through every part of it, that it has been acknowledged to be very <hi>full</hi> and <hi>excellent,</hi> even by those who are so <hi>unhappy</hi> as not to use it.</p>
               <p>I shall therefore take those <hi>Directions</hi> which are necessary to regulate our <hi>Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> at the time of <hi>receiving,</hi> from the several <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Churches Office,</hi> which will be of great <hi>Advantage</hi> in order to fix the ensuing <hi>Advices</hi> in our <hi>Memories,</hi> and assist us in their <hi>Practice,</hi> when we shall meet with them all in <hi>order</hi> (except some few things which relate to our <hi>private De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions)</hi> in the Churches excellent <hi>Form</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned; on every part whereof we
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:106561:81"/>
ought therefore to <hi>bend</hi> our Minds with the utmost <hi>Intention,</hi> and go to along with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Word</hi> which the Minister pronounces; which if we are <hi>careful</hi> to do, and to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve those <hi>Directions</hi> he therein gives us, we <hi>cannot fail of being worthy Receivers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we are therein directed to most of the same things which were before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, as necessary to our <hi>Preparation,</hi> tho' here they are to be all <hi>exercised</hi> and <hi>acted</hi> anew, with the utmost <hi>Intention</hi> of our Minds. And they are, first, <hi>Repentance.</hi> 2. <hi>Faith.</hi> 3. <hi>Devotion.</hi> 4. <hi>Humility.</hi> 5. <hi>Thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving.</hi> 6. <hi>Charity.</hi> And in the last place a <hi>particular, actual,</hi> and <hi>solemn Remembrance</hi> of our Saviour's <hi>Death,</hi> and the <hi>Ends</hi> of it, and of the <hi>Institution</hi> of this <hi>Sacrament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ III. And first, for <hi>Repentance,</hi> which we must <hi>renew</hi> and <hi>exercise</hi> at the <hi>Table</hi> of the <hi>Lord,</hi> because we are there to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new</hi> our <hi>Covenant</hi> with him, and must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently with the deepest <hi>Contrition,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore his <hi>Pardon</hi> for our frequent <hi>Breaches</hi> of it. I do not know whether ever there were in any <hi>humane Writings,</hi> so lively, full and pathetick a <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Confession,</hi> as that which the <hi>Church</hi> here uses, in the Name of all those which are minded to receive the <hi>Holy Communion;</hi> and one would think
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:106561:81"/>
it were scarce possible for any, unless the most <hi>hardned Sinner,</hi> to repeat this <hi>Confession</hi> after the Minister without being <hi>touched</hi> and <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> by it, and without feeling something of <hi>Contrition</hi> and <hi>Sorrow</hi> for his Offences. This I dare affirm, that there's no good Man, who has duly <hi>prepared</hi> himself for this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, but when he comes to this <hi>part of the Office,</hi> will find himself most <hi>sensibly</hi> and <hi>deeply affected</hi> with it: For as the Church has immediately before <hi>invited</hi> 
                  <q>those who do truly and earnestly repent of their Sins, to draw near and take this <hi>Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;</hi>
                  </q> so it instructs them in this <hi>most humble Confession to Almighty God,</hi> how to <hi>exercise</hi> that <hi>Repentance:</hi> In the first part whereof, we are taught, <q>to acknowledge and <hi>bewail</hi> our Sins. In the second, actually to <hi>repent</hi> of them, to detest and abhor them. In the third, 'to beg <hi>mercy</hi> for Jesus Christ's sake; and in the last place, to implore <hi>strength</hi> against them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>§ IV. 1. To <hi>acknowledge</hi> them, and to <hi>bewail</hi> our <hi>manifold</hi> Sins and Wickedness, since we can by no means <hi>hide</hi> them from the <hi>Eye</hi> of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and they are the truest and justest <hi>Causes</hi> of <hi>Lamentation</hi> and <hi>Sorrow.</hi> Nor are we to rest in <hi>generals,</hi> but here again, to call to mind the greatest and most <hi>hainous</hi> Sins, whereof on our former <hi>Examination,</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:106561:82"/>
we have found our selves guilty, whether in <hi>Thought, Word,</hi> or outward <hi>Action.</hi> These we are to acknowledge, we have most <hi>grievously</hi> committed; which may imply the <hi>hainous aggravation</hi> of them, for which we must <hi>own,</hi> that we have provoked most justly God's <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Indignation</hi> against us, that we have deserved his <hi>Anger,</hi> and all the dreadful <hi>Consequences</hi> thereof, in the <hi>Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> both of this and another World.</p>
               <p>§ V. And having thus <hi>confest</hi> and <hi>acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged</hi> our Sins, their <hi>number, continuance, extent,</hi> and <hi>aggravation,</hi> we are directed to proceed to the <hi>formal Act</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi> for them; to profess, <q>that we do earnestly <hi>repent,</hi> and are <hi>heartily sorry</hi> for these our <hi>misdoings;</hi>
                  </q> and woe to him, who, tho' he joyns in this <hi>solemn protestation</hi> with all <hi>good Christians</hi> yet does not <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>earnestly</hi> repent of his Sins, nor is heartily sorry for them, which how can he be thought to be when he falls into them again, on the next <hi>Temptation?</hi> whereas, if we do truly <hi>repent</hi> of them, <q>the <hi>Remembrance of them will be indeed grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous unto us,</hi>
                  </q> and their Burthen intolerable. We shall know how <hi>evil and bitter</hi> a thing it is to depart from the <hi>Living God,</hi> and be <hi>weary</hi> and <hi>heavy laden,</hi> and <hi>fly</hi> to Christ to give us <hi>rest.</hi> Which <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence</hi> of our Sins, ought to be raised to
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:106561:82"/>
the <hi>greatest heighth,</hi> at the time of <hi>Consecration,</hi> when we see Christ's <hi>Sacramental Body</hi> broken, and his <hi>Blood</hi> poured out <hi>for us:</hi> and just at the time of <hi>receiving,</hi> when we ought with an <hi>Holy Indignation</hi> to bring our <hi>Sins,</hi> and nail them to the <hi>Cross of Christ;</hi> to kill those <hi>Murderers,</hi> as <hi>Benaiah</hi> did <hi>Ioab,</hi> at the <hi>Horns</hi> of the <hi>Altar;</hi> to <hi>sacrifice</hi> them there, and <hi>hew</hi> them in pieces before the Lord; in short, to be deeply <hi>afflicted</hi> for them, and to make firm <hi>Resolves</hi> to forsake them.</p>
               <p>§ VI. In order to which, we must in the third place, ask <hi>mercy</hi> for Christ's sake, and <hi>pardon</hi> for all our <hi>Sins;</hi> as the <hi>Church</hi> teaches us in those <hi>moving</hi> and <hi>tender</hi> Expressions; <q>Have mercy upon us! Have mercy upon us most merciful Father! For thy Son our Lord Jesus Christ's sake, forgive us all that is past.</q> And this we have need to pray for, since without <hi>Forgiveness,</hi> the <hi>past Guilt</hi> remains, as well as the <hi>Punishment</hi> due for our Sins, tho' we should no more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them. But <hi>both</hi> are <hi>remitted</hi> in this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament to the <hi>worthy Receiver,</hi> not by Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of our own <hi>Merits,</hi> or any <hi>Preparation, Examination,</hi> or <hi>Repentance,</hi> or even of the very <hi>Act</hi> of outward <hi>receiving,</hi> but merely for Christ's sake, on account of his <hi>Merits</hi> and <hi>Intercession,</hi> and by the Virtue which
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:106561:83"/>
flows from his <hi>wounded Side,</hi> his <hi>spiritual Flesh</hi> and <hi>Blood,</hi> inwardly received by the <hi>Faithful</hi> in this <hi>Ordinance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ VII. Now we are taught to conclude this <hi>Confession,</hi> with praying, that God would <q>grant us that we may ever hereafter <hi>serve</hi> and <hi>please</hi> him in <hi>newness</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi>
                  </q> without which, all that's <hi>past</hi> is in <hi>vain;</hi> nor is there any that's so perfectly <hi>renewed</hi> that he has not still need to <hi>purge</hi> out something of the <hi>old Leaven.</hi> And tho' God will give such <hi>Grace</hi> to those who <hi>worthily</hi> partake of this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> yet has he appointed <hi>Prayer</hi> as the <hi>means</hi> to obtain it, and of our <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>severance</hi> in well-doing, and daily encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing in <hi>Goodness;</hi> which <hi>Prayer</hi> does <hi>virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally</hi> contain a <hi>Promise</hi> to use our own ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most endeavors to <hi>amend our Lives;</hi> that <hi>Resolution</hi> of better <hi>Obedience,</hi> which seems to be the very <hi>Act</hi> wherein we renew our <hi>Covenant</hi> with God, and engage to fulfil <hi>our part</hi> of it; which if we do faithfully <hi>perform,</hi> he will never be wanting to <hi>his.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ VIII. Thus much for <hi>Repentance.</hi> The second <hi>Grace</hi> to be exercised at the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament</hi> is <hi>Faith,</hi> which we are to reduce into <hi>Act</hi> when the Minister declares in the <hi>Absolution;</hi> 
                  <q>That Almighty God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:106561:83"/>
                     <hi>forgivenness</hi> of Sins to all them that with hearty <hi>Repentance,</hi> and true <hi>Faith,</hi> turn unto him; further praying, 'That God would have <hi>mercy</hi> upon us, <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> and deliver us from all our Sins, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and strengthen us in all <hi>Goodness,</hi> and bring us to <hi>Everlasting Life.</hi>
                  </q> Which <hi>Absolution</hi> we are humbly to receive up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our <hi>Knees,</hi> as an <hi>authoritative Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> from one <hi>commissioned</hi> by Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>bind</hi> and <hi>loose,</hi> and to <hi>remit</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> Sins: to which we are to add a hearty and faithful <hi>Amen;</hi> as being fully <hi>assured</hi> that God will perform what he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised by his <hi>Son,</hi> if we <hi>neglect</hi> not our parts in the <hi>Covenant. Faith</hi> is here more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently <hi>necessary,</hi> as well with respect to all the <hi>Promises</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> as to the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular <hi>Benefits</hi> of this Sacrament, and the application of them to our selves. For our Lord has said, <q>He that eateth my Flesh, and drinketh my Blood, hath eternal Life, and I will raise him up at the last Day.</q> The <hi>faithful Receiver</hi> eats and drinks <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> this <hi>Sacrament</hi> shall eminently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce unto it. He is thereby <hi>united</hi> to Christ, <hi>one</hi> with Christ and Christ with <hi>him,</hi> and by virtue of that indissoluble <hi>union,</hi> sealed in this <hi>Holy Ordinance,</hi> he receives a <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Immortality,</hi> whereby he shall
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:106561:84"/>
be, not only raised from the <hi>Death of sin</hi> in this World, but at length <hi>raised</hi> from the <hi>Grave,</hi> and live in endless <hi>Happiness:</hi> which also seems to be the meaning of the <hi>Prayer</hi> in the very <hi>delivery</hi> of the <hi>Elements,</hi> 
                  <q>The Body and Blood of our Lord Jesus Christ preserve the <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Soul</hi> to <hi>Everlasting Life;</hi>
                  </q> to which, most devout Christians add their <hi>private</hi> Amen, as being fully <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded</hi> that it shall have that happy effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy to every <hi>worthy Receiver.</hi> And the same <hi>Act of Faith</hi> they are to exert when they hear the Minister read those <hi>comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Words</hi> which our Saviour saith by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self and his Apostles, to all that truly turn unto him, <q>Come unto me all that travel and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> To which the devout <hi>Soul</hi> will be ready to answer, <q>Draw me, and we will run after thee! or with St. <hi>Peter,</hi> To whom should we go but to thee; thou hast the Words of eternal Life.</q> And so in the rest of the Sentences, applying them to himself by a particular <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> and saying, <q>Lord, I believe, help my unbelief.</q> And this <hi>Faith</hi> will be mightily advanced by our actual <hi>advertence</hi> to Christ's spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>presence</hi> in this Holy Ordinance, more eminently, graciously and peculiarly, than in any other. And the highest <hi>Act</hi> of it, is
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:106561:84"/>
to be <hi>exercised</hi> at the very instant of <hi>recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ IX. <hi>Devotion</hi> is in the third place high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly necessary to a <hi>Worthy Communicant,</hi> at the time of <hi>Celebration,</hi> and in all the parts of that <hi>Holy Office.</hi> By which <hi>Devotion</hi> is meant, <q>the intense <hi>abstraction,</hi> or withdrawing of the Mind from all <hi>wordly</hi> things, till it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires a contrary <hi>bent</hi> and <hi>inclination,</hi> and mounts freely and vigorously towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>despising</hi> and <hi>trampling</hi> all the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous trifles of this perishing World, and counting all things but <hi>Dung</hi> and <hi>Dross,</hi> for the <hi>Knowledge,</hi> for the <hi>Love</hi> of a crucified <hi>Redeemer;</hi>
                  </q> which every very <hi>good Man</hi> expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences in some <hi>happier moments of his Life.</hi> Now the way to obtain this, is the <hi>vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous</hi> acting of <hi>Faith, Repentance, Humility,</hi> and <hi>Divine Love;</hi> and the <hi>Energy</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward free <hi>motion</hi> of the <hi>Mind</hi> towards Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. And to this, the <hi>Church</hi> invites in those Words which were used on this occasion in the <hi>Primitive times.</hi> The <hi>sursum corda!</hi> or, <hi>Life up your Hearts!</hi> to which the Congregation replys, <q>We lift them up unto the Lord:</q> which we have the highest reason to do, when he confers such inestimable <hi>Favours</hi> upon us, and when Christ instituted this <hi>Feast,</hi> as has been said principally for this Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:106561:85"/>
that we should <hi>think</hi> upon him, our <hi>absent Friend;</hi> give our selves a little <hi>ease</hi> and <hi>breathing</hi> from the <hi>amusements</hi> and <hi>care</hi> of Life; <hi>escape</hi> from this <hi>World,</hi> and fix our <hi>Hearts</hi> upon a <hi>better,</hi> upon that <hi>happy place,</hi> 
                  <q> where Christ sits at the right Hand of God,</q> and whither, if we are faithful to him, we shall at length also arrive, seeing he has prayed to his Father, <q>That all those whom he has given him, may be with him where he is, that they may behold his Glory.</q> St. <hi>Iohn</hi> 17. 24.</p>
               <p>§ X. A fourth Grace is <hi>Humility.</hi> This is indeed included in <hi>Repentance,</hi> for a true <hi>Penitent</hi> must be <hi>humble:</hi> But we must be more <hi>explicite</hi> in it, and are directed by the Church, to form a particular <hi>Act</hi> thereof, immediately <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Consecration;</hi> when the Priest <hi>kneeling</hi> at the <hi>Lord's Table,</hi> says in the name of all that communicate, <q>We do not presume to come to this thy Table, O merciful Lord! trusting in our own Righteousness, but only in thy manifold and great Mercies. We are not worthy so much as to gather up the Crumbs under thy Table.</q> And indeed, one would wonder that any Christian should think he could express too great <hi>Humility,</hi> either of <hi>Body</hi> or <hi>Mind,</hi> when he comes before the <hi>Throne</hi>
                  <pb n="155" facs="tcp:106561:85"/>
of God to receive his <hi>Pardon.</hi> 'Tis this most <hi>humble prostration</hi> of <hi>Soul,</hi> this <hi>abase<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>annihilation</hi> of our selves, and utterly disclaiming our own <hi>merits,</hi> which seems to be the <hi>bottom</hi> of that <hi>seraphical Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity,</hi> which has made so much <hi>noise</hi> in the World. If they make it more than this, 'tis <hi>dangerous Enthusiasm,</hi> as has appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and others. If they rest it here, as is done in some part at least, of <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable and rational, and may be of great Advantage in the course of a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Life;</hi> especially in the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> where the <hi>lower</hi> we abase our selves, the <hi>higher</hi> will God raise us. And this we ought particularly to exercise when we see the Minister approaching to us, with the <hi>Bread</hi> or <hi>Wine,</hi> and firmly to believe, that we shall receive our Saviour together with them.</p>
               <p>§ XI. But yet fifthly; this ought not to <hi>hinder,</hi> but rather to <hi>encrease</hi> our <hi>Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;</hi> because, as has been said, the Sense of God's <hi>Goodness</hi> must needs be advanced by the consideration of our own <hi>unworthiness.</hi> To this the <hi>Church</hi> especially, directs us: <q>
                     <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove</hi> all things, ye must render most <hi>humble</hi>
                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:106561:86"/>
and hearty <hi>Thanks</hi> to God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, for the Redemption of the World by the Death and Passion of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</q> And again, after the <hi>Sursum Corda,</hi> we are invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <q>To give <hi>Thanks</hi> to our Lord God,</q> to which the Congregation answers, <q>'Tis meet and right so to do.</q> On which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows that solemn <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Thanks</hi> and <hi>Praise</hi> which the Priest alone pronounces, as 'tis said our Saviour did in St. <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 19. and in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 24. <q>He took Bread, and when he had <hi>given Thanks,</hi> he <hi>broke</hi> it.</q> From which <hi>Actions,</hi> the whole Sacrament obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed two Names; the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> from <hi>giving Thanks,</hi> as 'tis expresly called in two or three places of the New Testament, in the <hi>Syriac</hi> Version; and <hi>breaking of Bread,</hi> as 'tis stiled in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles.</hi> Now this <hi>praising</hi> God, and <hi>acknowledging</hi> and <hi>adoring</hi> his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Goodness, ought to spread it self thro' every part of the Office: And even our <hi>Repentance</hi> and <hi>Humility</hi> would be so managed, as to encrease our <hi>Praises.</hi> But we should more especially, exercise our <hi>Thankfulness,</hi> when the Minister says, <q>It is meet, right, and our bounden Duty, that we should at <hi>all times,</hi> 
                     <note n="*" place="margin">1 Thess. 5. 16.</note> and in all places</q> give <hi>Thanks</hi> unto God;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:106561:86"/>
on which follows that <hi>Seraphical Anthem,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated by Saints here below, and Angels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove: <q>Therefore with Angels and Arch-angels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> In which the <hi>pious Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant</hi> joins both in <hi>Heart</hi> and <hi>Voice,</hi> as well as in the particular Prefaces before it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we are directed to <hi>praise</hi> God, either for the <hi>Birth</hi> of Christ, or his <hi>Resurrection,</hi> or <hi>Ascension,</hi> or for his sending the <hi>Holy Ghost;</hi> or else we <hi>adore</hi> the <hi>Divine Trinity</hi> in the <hi>Unity</hi> of the <hi>Godhead:</hi> which Prefaces seem to have been added, because the Church does not doubt, but that so often at least, as these <hi>greater Festivals</hi> return, there will be a <hi>Communion.</hi> And after we have received, <q>We entirely desire our heavenly Father, mercifully to accept our Sacrifice of <hi>Praise</hi> and <hi>Thanksgiving;</hi> and we most hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>thank</hi> him, that he has vouchsafed to feed us, who have duly received these Holy Mysteries, with the spiritual Food of the most precious Body and Blood of his dear Son, and assured us thereby, of his Favour and Goodness towards us:</q> And then we again break out into that Hymn of <hi>Praise</hi> to the whole <hi>Blessed Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> part of which is the same that was sung by the <hi>Angels</hi> at the Birth of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; <q>Glory to God on High, on Earth Peace, Good-will toward Men.</q> But more

especially, are we to have our <hi>Hearts</hi> filled with the most exalted <hi>Praises,</hi> in the very <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Receiving,</hi> to which the Minister exhorts us in the delivery both of the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine.</hi> Nothing but <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Holy Ioy,</hi> and <hi>humble Praise,</hi> are then to be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Then, when the <hi>Holy Soul</hi> is in the <hi>Mount with God,</hi> and says, 'tis good for her to be here, and if any thing of distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance can find Entrance, 'tis because she must so soon return again to a sordid, vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, impertinent World, when she is now already on the Wing for Heaven, is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced so far upward in that glorious <hi>Road,</hi> and would so gladly fly away and be at rest in the Bosom of her <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer.</hi>

               <p>§ XII. The last Grace is <hi>Charity,</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the largest Sense, for <hi>Love</hi> to God and to our Neighbour. 1. <hi>Love to God,</hi> the <hi>Soul</hi> of all <hi>Piety,</hi> which quickens and enlivens every <hi>Christian Duty.</hi> This is here encreased by remembring God's <hi>Love</hi> to us, in sending his Son, and our Saviour's <hi>Love,</hi> in giving himself to die for us. This <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is the dearest <hi>Token</hi> of his <hi>Love,</hi> and the Church accordingly tells us, <q>That to the <hi>End,</hi> we should always remember the exceeding great <hi>Love</hi> of our Master, and only Saviour
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:106561:87"/>
Jesus Christ in dying for us, he has insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted and ordained Holy Mysteries as Pledges of it.</q> And the actual and lively Consideration hereof, of Christ's wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Love</hi> towards us, miserable Sinners, so ungrateful, so unworthy, so often guilty of broken <hi>Faith,</hi> and broken <hi>Vows,</hi> who have loved the World and our own Lusts, more than him, who have <hi>grieved</hi> him, who have <hi>wounded</hi> him, who have <hi>crucified</hi> him by our Sins, and who continue to do so; (for there is no Man that lives and sins not,) and all this, to him who still <hi>loves</hi> us, and still <hi>offers</hi> us <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Pardon,</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Heaven,</hi> and even his own <hi>blessed Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> in this <hi>heavenly Feast:</hi> Shall not all this prevail with us to give him our worthless Love again for the rest of our Lives? To give it him without <hi>excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and without <hi>reserve.</hi> It must, it will, it cannot fail of having this <hi>happy effect,</hi> if we carefully regard every part of this <hi>sacred Action,</hi> and intently consider our Saviour's Death, as <hi>represented</hi> therein; especially while the Minister is consecrating the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> the whole Prayer of <hi>Consecration</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made up of a <hi>lively</hi> and <hi>thankful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognition</hi> of our Saviour's <hi>sufferings,</hi> and of his instituting the <hi>Sacrament</hi> in memory of them. We are therefore, in order to the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:106561:88"/>
and encreasing of our <hi>Love</hi> to Christ diligently at that <hi>time,</hi> to regard the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster with our <hi>Eye,</hi> and Christ with our <hi>Hearts.</hi> When we see the <hi>Bread</hi> broken, and the <hi>Wine</hi> poured out, then to consider with all the <hi>Agonies</hi> of our <hi>Souls,</hi> and with <hi>Hearts</hi> pierced and melted with the <hi>Love</hi> of Jesus, what <hi>Agonies</hi> he himself endured for us, both in his <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Mind.</hi> Then to look on him whom we have <hi>pierced,</hi> and <hi>mourn</hi> for him, and <hi>delight</hi> in him, and hate those Sins which were the cause of this, and which can only divide us from his <hi>Love;</hi> and especially when we <hi>actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</hi> Then are our <hi>Souls</hi> to be intimately united to his <hi>Divine Person.</hi> Then are we to <hi>embrace</hi> him as the chiefest of Ten Thousands, and fairer than all the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Men; to adore his infinite <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,</hi> to be lost in the <hi>contemplation</hi> and <hi>admiration</hi> of them, and to be wholly <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vished</hi> with his <hi>Love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XIII. Which will mightily assist us in the exercise of the other branch of <hi>Charity, Love to our Neighbour,</hi> for this cannot but be easie to us when our Minds are raised to this happy Temper. The <hi>Love</hi> of Christ will subdue the <hi>Enmity</hi> of our <hi>Natures</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards each other, that <hi>Pride</hi> which is the cause of almost all <hi>Quarrels,</hi> that <hi>bitterness</hi>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:106561:88"/>
of Spirit, and Rancor, and Malice, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge and Anger. Those <hi>obscene Birds</hi> will all fly away before the <hi>Beams</hi> of the <hi>blessed Sun</hi> of Righteousness, as did the Devils of old from their <hi>Oracles.</hi> All our <hi>Hatred</hi> will be against our Sins, all our <hi>Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> our <hi>Resentments,</hi> our <hi>Revenge,</hi> (for neither were those in vain implanted in our Minds) will be turned quite another way. O how happy would the World be, did but the <hi>Body</hi> of Christians frequently and worthily receive the <hi>Communion.</hi> I am confident, nothing could sooner heal the wide Wounds of Christendom, as I believe the neglect of it has been the great Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of them, as well as of all our own Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Divisions. All good Men <hi>must</hi> love one another, if they often met at this <hi>Holy Table.</hi> They could not, they dared not there retain, or nourish any <hi>pique</hi> against each other. They would <hi>Love much,</hi> both Christ and his <hi>Members,</hi> because they so often considered that <hi>much was forgiven them.</hi> And tho' this may seem a Digres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, yet the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Consequences</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of appear so plain, and so considerable, that I knew not how to omit it. But to return; <hi>Charity</hi> is here to be actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised towards all Christ's <hi>Members,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:106561:89"/>
towards those with whom we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate. We are to <hi>knit</hi> our <hi>Hearts</hi> most closely and intimately to them, with the Bands of <hi>Holy Love. Poor</hi> and <hi>Rich,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception, only loving those <hi>most</hi> that love <hi>God</hi> most. We are to <hi>pray</hi> for them all, and not only in the <hi>Offertory,</hi> but on other occasions, to do them all the <hi>Good</hi> we can, by faithful <hi>Counsel,</hi> by tender and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Reproof,</hi> and by all lawful and possible <hi>means,</hi> promoting the welfare of their <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Bodies.</hi> And lastly, by <hi>devout Prayer</hi> to God for them, as we are directed: <q>That all who are partakers of this <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> may be filled with his Grace and heavenly Benediction.</q> But tho' our <hi>Charity</hi> is to <hi>begin</hi> there, we are not to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine</hi> the <hi>Exercise</hi> thereof to those only who then actually communicate with us, for we are also directed by the excellent <hi>Spirit</hi> of our Church, shewing it self in those Holy <hi>Confessors</hi> and <hi>Martyrs</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed her Liturgy; <q>humbly to beseech God to grant, by the Merits and Death of his Son Jesus Christ, and thro' Faith in his Blood, that not only <hi>we,</hi> but also his <hi>whole Church</hi> may obtain Remission of our Sins, and all other Benefits of his Passion.</q> Which may he grant who has so
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:106561:89"/>
dearly purchased it for us, to whom with the Father and Holy Ghost, be all Glory, Honour and Dominion, now, and to Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ages. <hi>Amen!</hi>

                  <p>O Infinite offended Goodness! who art a consuming Fire to the obstinate Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; but infinite to pardon those who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess and forsake their Sins. I desire ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to repent of all my Misdeeds! I will acknowledge my Transgressions before thee, and mine Iniquities will I not hide. I have sinned! I have sinned! O Father, against Heaven and before thee. Against thy Mercies and thy Judgments, the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of thy Law, and the still small Voice of thy Gospel. Against the clearest Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestations of thy wonderful Love, in sending thy Son to shed his Blood as an attonement for the Sins of the whole World; which precious Blood of his, I
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:106561:90"/>
have too often trampled under Foot, and crucified the Son of God afresh by my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Iniquities. Not all his bitter Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have been so far able to pierce my hard Heart, as to make me entirely forsake my Sins which were the Cause of them. Tho' he sweat Drops of Blood in the Garden; tho' his Soul was exceedingly sorrowful even unto Death; tho' he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the Contradiction of Sinners; tho' he was mocked, and buffeted, and spit on, and crowned with Thorns, and scour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, and fainted under his Cross, and was nailed unto it, and raised in the Air a spectacle to Men and Angels; tho' he there groaned under the weight of <hi>our Guilt,</hi> and of <hi>our Sins</hi> imputed unto him, tho' he thirsted, tho' he fainted, tho' he cried out as if thou thy self couldst have <hi>forsaken</hi> him; tho' he bowed his Head, and gave up the Ghost. O! shall all this nothing move me! shall my Heart be as hard as the nether Milstone! Cannot the Blood of Jesus soften it, and cleanse it; that Blood of sprinkling which speaks better things than that of <hi>Abel?</hi> Shall I not now at least detest, abhor, forsake all those Sins which cost my Saviour so dear! shall I again commit them! shall I any more favour those <hi>Iudas</hi>'s which betrayed, those

O Lord, my Heart is deceitful, and desperately wicked, and has often already deceived me, and my Goodness is as the morning Cloud, and early Dew which soon passeth away, and without thy Grace I shall again fall into those very Sins which I now detest and abhor: which that I may never more do, imprint, I beseech thee, in my Mind, so lively a Sense of my Saviour's Sufferings, and let me receive, and carry away so lasting an Impression of them from this Sacrament, that I may henceforth die unto Sin, and live unto Righteousness; that I may subdue and mortifie more and more all cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Desires, and the whole Body of Death, thro' Jesus Christ my Lord.</p>

                  <p>WHence is it, O Lord, that such a Wretch as I, so loathsome and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with Sin, should once more be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to thy presence to taste the Bread of Life! Whence is it that my Saviour should be Guest to one that is such a Sinner? O Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst come under my Roof, nor that I should come under thine: I desire to humble my self before thee, with the utmost prostration and adoration. I cast my self at the Feet of Jesus, and will not let him go, except he bless me. <q>I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, I have nothing, I desire nothing, but Jesus, and to be with him in Peace, in the heavenly <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
                     </q> The lowest place in Heaven will be infinitely above what I can deserve, who wonder why thou shouldst cast thine Eyes on such a nothing.

O ever blessed Jesus! who, tho' thou fillest Heaven and Earth with the Majesty of thy Glory, didst yet humble thy self when thou camest into the World, to the inconveniences of a Cave, a Stable, and a Manger: My Heart is yet meaner than any of these, but thou canst purifie and cleanse it, and make it a Temple fit for thy self to dwell in. Come and meet me in thy own comfortable Ordinance, who hast promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, tho' thou wilt resist the proud, to give Grace to the humble. I beg this, O Father, for the sake of Jesus Christ my Saviour, who humbled himself to the Death upon the Cross, for me a miserable Sinner; to whom with thee and the Holy Ghost, Three and One, be all Honour and Glory, now and for ever.</p>

                  <p>ALL Glory and Honour, and Praise, to him who sits upon the Throne, and to the Lamb for ever! To him who has loved us, and washed us from our Sins in his own Blood, and has now entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with that heavenly Food, which those who taste with Faith, shall never die. I have tasted that God is Good, and that blessed are all those that trust in him; he is not a barren Land, or a dry Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.

                  <p>O Infinite Goodness! O amiable Jesu! O bleeding, dying, agonizing Love! What Man, what Angel in Heaven durst have ever thought of such a way to appease God's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger against Sinners, as the Death of thee the Only begotten Son of God, had not thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther freely sent thee, hadst not thou thy self as freely descended to Earth, and taken our mortal Clay upon thee, to do, and to suffer the Will of God? Who could have believed this, hadst not thou thy self re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed it, and confirmed it by so many Miracles! Nay, as if it had not been suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to die for us, thou hast also given us the heavenly Food of thy blessed Body and Blood, to be our spiritual Nourishment in this Holy Sacrament. Thou hast made

me partaker of those venerable Mysteries: Thou hast renewed that Covenant with me, which I trust shall never be broken! O! was there no other way to save Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, but the Death of him that lives for ever! were all the Souls of the lost Sons of <hi>Adam</hi> worth one Groan, one Torment, one Drop of the precious Blood of the Son of God!

I grieve, and I love, O my Redeemer, for all that thou hast done for me, for all that I have done against thee. O when shall I love thee without any Interruption, any Distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance from this intruding World! when shall I be ever with thee, and be satisfied with thy Love! My Heart beats towards thee, my Soul desires, and pants, and longs earnestly to be united with thee, never, never more to be divided. I would fain

Come, O thou whom my Soul desires to Love! thou chiefest of Ten Thousands, and all together lovely, and fill my Heart so full with the Sense of thy Goodness, and with longing desires after thee, that I may frequently, that I may constantly present my self here at thy Table, to meet thee, and bless thee. That I may shew I have been with Jesus, by telling what great things he has done for me, by endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make all others admire and love him; that I may still aspire more earnestly towards those blessed Regions of Peace and Love, where he is entered before me to prepare a place for me; and in the mean time, let all my Actions be guided by the Love of Jesus, that I may be made perfect in his Love, and it may expel all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Loves from my Heart, that are incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with it.

                  <hi>Morning,</hi> or want of <hi>earnestness</hi> in our pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate <hi>Devotions,</hi> or of taking a just <hi>Care</hi> to <hi>raise</hi> our <hi>Hearts</hi> towards Heaven, and to <hi>fix</hi> them on the <hi>Feast</hi> and the <hi>Inviter;</hi> or from our unnecessary <hi>mingling</hi> over-much with the <hi>World</hi> soon afterwards; or not <hi>keeping our Feet,</hi> our <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> in good order, when going to the <hi>House</hi> of God, or when present there, or not <hi>bending</hi> and <hi>fixing</hi> them with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most <hi>Intention</hi> to what we were employed in; or not <hi>considering</hi> as we ought, Christ's <hi>Love,</hi> and God's <hi>Presence,</hi> and <hi>Goodness,</hi> and <hi>Majesty,</hi> and <hi>Glory;</hi> or coming in our <hi>own Strength,</hi> and depending too much upon it, not <hi>casting</hi> our selves entirely on God's <hi>Mercy</hi> thro' Christ; some or more of which <hi>miscarriages</hi> may have been the cause of our want of <hi>Comfort</hi> or <hi>Advantage</hi> from this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> for which we therefore ought to <hi>blame</hi> our <hi>selves,</hi> and not to <hi>charge God foolishly;</hi> to be <hi>humbled</hi> for them; and carefully to <hi>note</hi> them down, or <hi>remember</hi> them against the <hi>next Sacrament,</hi> that we may be then more <hi>watchful</hi> against them, and avoid what has now been so <hi>disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous</hi> unto us. Nor are we to be <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful,</hi> if on Reflection we find that God's <hi>Grace</hi> has preserved us from any such <hi>Inconveniences;</hi> that our <hi>Hearts</hi> have been
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:106561:96"/>
fixed, our <hi>Devotions</hi> enflam'd, our <hi>Affections</hi> raised, our <hi>Love</hi> to God, and <hi>hatred</hi> of Sin, heightened and augmented by what has past at that <hi>heavenly Feast;</hi> and that it has been <hi>sweeter</hi> to us than the <hi>Honey</hi> and the <hi>Honey-Comb,</hi> and helpt us to <hi>despise</hi> the World, and to <hi>long</hi> for Heaven. These are <hi>Blessings</hi> which ought not to be <hi>forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> but the <hi>Remembrance</hi> of them should be <hi>dear</hi> unto us; we ought to revive the <hi>Impression</hi> of them upon our <hi>Hearts,</hi> and to <hi>sink</hi> them deeper there, that they may have a future lasting <hi>Influence</hi> on our <hi>Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ III. And here it may be necessary to interpose a <hi>double caution</hi> as to these Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. There are some who are so afraid of <hi>Enthusiasm,</hi> that they almost forbid a <hi>devout Christian</hi> to <hi>expect</hi> or to <hi>desire</hi> any more than <hi>ordinary Ioy</hi> or <hi>Delight</hi> in God's Service; nay, to <hi>suspect</hi> it when ever he finds it: while others fansie that they have no <hi>Communion with God in any Duty,</hi> nor are indeed any thing the <hi>better</hi> for it, if they have not always these <hi>sensible tasts</hi> of his <hi>Goodness.</hi> A <hi>rational Christian</hi> ought to keep the <hi>mean</hi> between these two <hi>Extreams,</hi> so as neither to <hi>despise,</hi> far be it from him, that heavenly <hi>Manna,</hi> that Angel's Food of <hi>Ioy,</hi>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:106561:96"/>
in <hi>Believing;</hi> the pleasures of God's <hi>House</hi> and <hi>Table,</hi> the <hi>Fruits</hi> of the <hi>Tree of Life,</hi> the <hi>foretasts</hi> of Heaven; for which he pants, as the thirsty <hi>Hart</hi> does after the refreshing Streams; being fully perswaded, by Reason, Experience, and Scripture, that <hi>Ioy in the Holy Ghost,</hi> and <hi>Fellowship with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and the Son,</hi> are something more than <hi>Enthusiastical Fancies;</hi> that God can <hi>commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate</hi> himself to his Creatures, in what <hi>mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,</hi> and by what <hi>means</hi> he pleases; and that his own <hi>Institutions</hi> are those <hi>means</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he does thus communicate himself to prepar'd and holy Minds; and therefore he cannot rest in the <hi>outward</hi> only, but prays for the <hi>Light</hi> of God's Countenance, and the <hi>Ioy</hi> of his Salvation, which make up so great a part of the <hi>Happiness of Heaven;</hi> and when he has thus tasted how good the Lord is, he cannot but be entirely thankful for it. But yet, neither does he estimate his <hi>Profit</hi> in any religious Duty, or the <hi>presence</hi> of God in them by these <hi>sensible Ioys only:</hi> He knows our weak Nature is neither able long to <hi>bear</hi> them, nor is often <hi>fit</hi> for them. He expects not <hi>all Canaan,</hi> while on this side <hi>Iordan,</hi> tho' he cannot but be delighted with a <hi>taste,</hi> sometimes of the <hi>Fruits</hi> of that happy Country. He believes he has <hi>then Benefit</hi> by any Duty, and particularly by
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:106561:97"/>
this <hi>Sacrament,</hi> and that <hi>then</hi> God is present with him in it, when he finds that he is thereby more <hi>settled</hi> in his <hi>Faith,</hi> his <hi>Hope,</hi> and his <hi>Obedience;</hi> more rooted and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Holy <hi>Love</hi> both to God and his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Brother; when he finds his <hi>will</hi> more <hi>submissive,</hi> and entirely <hi>resigned</hi> to God's So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign <hi>Will,</hi> and the Duties of Religion growing gradually, more <hi>easie,</hi> and as it were <hi>natural,</hi> and delightful to him: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently, he cannot be so well satisfied of his profiting by a <hi>Sacrament</hi> immediately <hi>after</hi> he has received, (for he expects it not all at once,) as at some distance of <hi>time,</hi> when the <hi>Grace</hi> he then received, is as it were <hi>digested</hi> in his Mind, and spreads it self thro' all the Parts and Offices of an holy Life.</p>
               <p>§ IV. After examining the <hi>Frame</hi> of our Minds at the past <hi>Communion,</hi> we are, in the next place, exactly to reflect on those <hi>Holy Vows</hi> and <hi>Resolves</hi> which we have made at God's <hi>Altar,</hi> whether, against Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Impurity, Intemperance, immoderate Love to the World, neglect of <hi>Sacraments,</hi> or of publick, private, or Family Devotion, or of the <hi>Souls</hi> of those whom God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence has committed to our Charge, or any other failure whereof we found our
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:106561:97"/>
selves guilty in our former <hi>Preparation</hi> and <hi>Examination,</hi> and which we have anew vowed against at the <hi>Communion;</hi> all which <hi>Vows,</hi> if we did now again solemnly <hi>renew,</hi> and implore, and expect the <hi>continuance</hi> of Divine <hi>Strength</hi> to perform them, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the <hi>means</hi> to obtain and preserve it, we should doubtless find great Advantage by it; especially if we <hi>renewed</hi> the same in our <hi>daily Examination;</hi> which must needs preserve both the sense of God's <hi>Goodness,</hi> and of our own <hi>Obligations</hi> more <hi>fresh</hi> and <hi>lively</hi> on our Minds, and have a good <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence</hi> on our Practice, tho' at greater <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> from the <hi>Communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ V. And indeed, this is the main <hi>hinge</hi> of the whole matter; the great <hi>means</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we must gain advantage by the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and which, if we neglect, we must at least, expect the loss of our <hi>Comfort,</hi> if not our <hi>Souls.</hi> 'Tis, to remember all is <hi>not over as soon as we have received:</hi> No, nor that <hi>Day,</hi> nor <hi>Week,</hi> nor indeed, <hi>while we live;</hi> for the Obligation is for <hi>ever.</hi> We do in the <hi>Sacrament</hi> shew forth the <hi>Lord's Death,</hi> 
                  <q>Till he come,</q> We engage our selves by this <hi>Oath,</hi> as well as by that at <hi>Baptism,</hi> to be <q>his faithful Soldiers and Servants to our Lives End.</q> We are not to think the
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:106561:98"/>
                  <hi>Oath</hi> it <hi>self</hi> is all, since 'tis but a <hi>Security</hi> to our future <hi>Faith,</hi> and true <hi>Allegiance:</hi> 'Tis not enough to <hi>Vow;</hi> nay, 'tis better not to <hi>vow</hi> at all, than to <hi>vow</hi> and <hi>not to pay;</hi> tho' to do <hi>both</hi> is still <hi>better</hi> than either. We cannot too often remember that those <hi>Graces</hi> which we exercise at this <hi>Ordinance,</hi> must also be put in <hi>Practice</hi> thro' the whole <hi>course</hi> of our <hi>Lives,</hi> and 'tis the reason of its <hi>Institution,</hi> that they may by degrees be reduced into <hi>holy Habits.</hi> We must be <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly better'd</hi> by the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as well as by other Duties, or else, indeed, we are not better at all, for as one well observes, <q>Religion is not a Road of Performances, but a <hi>New Nature,</hi> evidenced by a <hi>New Life.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>§ VI. But more especially, are we to call to mind these <hi>Promises</hi> and <hi>Obligations,</hi> when we find our selves again attack'd by any <hi>Temptation,</hi> either to those <hi>Sins</hi> which we have formerly committed, or to any others. Wo to him who after he has escaped the <hi>Pollutions</hi> of the World, and <hi>tasted</hi> the <hi>good Word</hi> of God, and the Powers of the World to come in this <hi>Ordinance,</hi> shall yet <hi>fall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> again, return like a <hi>Dog to his Vomit,</hi> shamefully yield to the same Sin, which he has before so solemnly <hi>renounced,</hi> and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:106561:98"/>
to <hi>forsake,</hi> and thereby, in a great measure, trample under foot the <hi>Blood</hi> of the <hi>Covenant,</hi> crucifie the Son of God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh, and put him to open <hi>shame.</hi> I speak not of lesser unavoidable Infirmities, such as <hi>wandring Thoughts,</hi> the first motions of <hi>Passion,</hi> or being ready to give way to the violence of <hi>Temptation,</hi> tho' recovering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; but what I here intend, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsing into any <hi>grosser Sins,</hi> such as <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanness,</hi> Injustice, Drunkenness, habitual Carelessness of <hi>Duty,</hi> and <hi>neglect</hi> of God's <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and our private sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Devotions;</hi> which last may justly be ranked among <hi>greater Sins,</hi> as being too frequently the <hi>beginning</hi> of all the rest. Not that even these are <hi>unpardonable</hi> on true <hi>Repentance;</hi> but that the <hi>Aggravations</hi> of them are so exceedingly heightned by the addition of <hi>Ingratitude</hi> and <hi>Perjury.</hi> An <hi>old Wound</hi> may possibly be <hi>cured</hi> at last, even when 'tis <hi>badly healed;</hi> but then there's a necessity of its being <hi>laid</hi> open a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and the Pain will be more <hi>exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site</hi> than it was at the <hi>first.</hi> We ought therefore, when attack'd by any old <hi>Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> to oppose immediately this power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Armor</hi> against it; and whatever plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure or profit it's <hi>baited</hi> with by the <hi>great Deceiver,</hi> with <hi>Indignation</hi> to reject it.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:106561:99"/>
To reflect vigorously on our new Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the contrary, both of <hi>Promises,</hi> of <hi>Interest,</hi> and of <hi>Gratitude.</hi> To say within our selves, <q>I have <hi>sworn,</hi> and am sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastly purposed to keep God's righteous Judgments. And, 'Get thee behind me Satan, the God of Peace, whose I am, and who has promised to help me, shall bruise thee under my Feet.</q> And to this end we must be always upon our <hi>Guard,</hi> we must be <hi>temperate</hi> and <hi>sober,</hi> or else we can never be <hi>vigilant.</hi> We must avoid <hi>ill Company,</hi> the great <hi>Emissaries</hi> of Satan, as we would Satan himself. A great End of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is to make us look <hi>forward,</hi> and remember Christ's last <hi>coming,</hi> as well as backward, in remembrance of his <hi>Death;</hi> and he who <hi>eats</hi> and <hi>drinks</hi> with the <hi>Drunken,</hi> will soon be apt to say, <q>
                     <hi>My Lord delays his coming;</hi> tho' to such he himself has said, That he will come in a day when he looks not for him, and in an hour that he is not aware of, and will cut him in sunder, and divide him his portion with the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites.</q> The frequent Reflection on our latter End, will also mightily confirm us in our <hi>holy Purposes</hi> of Obedience; the time of our own <hi>particular Iudgment,</hi> or at least of our passing into our <hi>unchangeable Eternity,</hi> which we should often meditate
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:106561:99"/>
upon, and <hi>Discourse</hi> concerning it with our <hi>Fellow Christians,</hi> instead of those <hi>impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> and worse, which make up so great a part of <hi>common Conversation.</hi> And those who thus speak <hi>often one to another,</hi> and <hi>remind</hi> each other of their <hi>Duty,</hi> need not be much concerned, tho' they are <hi>despised</hi> for it by <hi>ill Men,</hi> since the <hi>Lord</hi> himself will <hi>hearken</hi> and <hi>hear,</hi> and <hi>remember</hi> them for it when he comes in <hi>Vengeance</hi> to <hi>destroy</hi> the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly.</hi> Malac. 3. 16. 4. 1, 2.</p>
               <p>§ VII. In the next place, we would do well to consider that the <hi>Sacrament</hi> is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for our <hi>perfection</hi> in <hi>Grace,</hi> as well as <hi>Conquest</hi> over our <hi>Sins.</hi> 'Tis not enough merely to escape the <hi>Pollutions</hi> of the <hi>World,</hi> but we must also <hi>aspire</hi> towards <hi>Perfection,</hi> to be <hi>strong Men</hi> in Christ. We are all called to be <hi>Saints,</hi> to <hi>Glory,</hi> as well as to <hi>Vertue,</hi> and why should we then be content with the lowest <hi>measures?</hi> He that thinks he'll be just <hi>good enough</hi> to be <hi>saved,</hi> if he does not <hi>miss</hi> of that, must not, however, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect much <hi>Comfort.</hi> Nay, not to go <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, is to go backward</hi> in the way to <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> We are obliged by the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> to do <hi>all we can</hi> for him who has done so <hi>much for us:</hi> Always to <hi>abound in the work of the Lord,</hi> since when we have done our
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:106561:100"/>
                  <hi>best,</hi> we shall be so far from <hi>Supererrogation</hi> However, as <hi>Health</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> are infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Signs</hi> of <hi>Life,</hi> so we shall obtain this <hi>great Advantage</hi> by <hi>stronger Degrees</hi> of <hi>Grace,</hi> that we may be <hi>better</hi> satisfied of the <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Sincerity</hi> thereof. Consider, that this would render <hi>God's Service</hi> much more <hi>easie</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful</hi> to us. But this must cost us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>Pains</hi> and <hi>Labour,</hi> for <hi>Sloth</hi> is the <hi>great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Obstruction</hi> to our <hi>growing in Grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Iesus Christ;</hi> and is commonly the <hi>last Enemy</hi> in this <hi>World</hi> that is destroyed in a <hi>Christian.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer that and <hi>all</hi> is done. Shake off that <hi>Ague</hi> of the <hi>Soul;</hi> remember your <hi>Vows,</hi> call for <hi>Strength, believe</hi> and all things are <hi>possible. Give Diligence to make your Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and Election sure, for he that does these things shall never fall;</hi> and the higher we rise in <hi>Piety</hi> here, the shorter <hi>Steps</hi> we shall have to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and it's very probable, the <hi>higher Degrees</hi> of <hi>Glory</hi> among those <hi>many</hi> different <hi>mansions</hi> in our <hi>Father's House.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ VIII. In the last place, when we are called again by <hi>God's Providence</hi> to another <hi>Sacrament,</hi> which <hi>happy Opportunity</hi> we will be <hi>careful</hi> never to <hi>neglect;</hi> let us, in our <hi>Preparation</hi> and <hi>Examination,</hi> impartially <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire</hi> how we have <hi>performed</hi> those <hi>Vows</hi>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:106561:100"/>
we made in the <hi>last,</hi> and how we have <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited</hi> by it. To <hi>rejoyce</hi> and <hi>bless God,</hi> if <hi>well,</hi> to be <hi>humbled</hi> if otherwise, and the greater the <hi>Defect,</hi> the deeper the <hi>Humiliation.</hi> I speak here, of <hi>lesser Infirmities,</hi> rather than of <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous, scandalous Sins,</hi> the <hi>Habits</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, while <hi>unreformed</hi> and <hi>unrepented,</hi> do ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly exclude from the <hi>Sacrament,</hi> as well as from <hi>Heaven.</hi> Nor ought we by any means to be <hi>ungrateful,</hi> if we find that thro' <hi>God's Grace, preventing</hi> us that we might be <hi>willing,</hi> and <hi>assisting</hi> us when we were <hi>willing,</hi> we may have obtained any Advantage against our <hi>Spiritual Enemies:</hi> If any <hi>Sin</hi> be weaker, any <hi>Vertue</hi> stronger; whether <hi>Patience,</hi> or <hi>Humility,</hi> or <hi>Resignation,</hi> or <hi>Devotion;</hi> for which we are again to approach full of <hi>Gratitude</hi> to the <hi>Holy Table,</hi> to offer the <hi>Sacrifice of Praise</hi> and take the <hi>Cup of Salvation, and call upon the Name of the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These things if we observe and do, thro' the whole Course of our Lives, <q>we shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour, but an abundant Entrance shall be ministred unto us into his Everlasting Kingdom.</q> 
                  <hi>To whom be Glory in the Church throughout all Ages.</hi> Amen!</p>

Let me look by Faith beyond this Vale of Tears and Misery, to that happy place which knows no Pain, or Want, or Sorrows, as being assur'd that there is an End, and my Expectation shall not be cut off. I know, O Lord! that a Man's Life consists not in the abundance of Things that he pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sesses, but that he who has the most here, as he brought nothing with him into this World, so he shall carry nothing out. I bless thee that thou hast not given me my Portion among those who have received

all their Consolation here, whose Portion is in this Life only. Neither let me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect those Blessings which thou hast pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised to the Poor, unless I am really poor in Spirit, and meek and humble. I know nothing is impossible with God, and that it is thou alone who givest Power to get Riches, and that thou canst by thy good Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, raise me from this mean Condition whenever thou pleasest, and wilt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do it if it be best for me, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore humbly submit all unto thy wise and kind Disposal. I desire not Wealth or Greatness: Give me neither extreme Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, nor do I ask Riches of thee, but only to be fed with Food convenient for me. I desire earnestly to seek first the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God and the Righteousness thereof, well hoping that in thy good Time, Food and Raiment, all other things that be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, shall be added unto me. I believe, O Lord! that thou who feedest the Ravens, and clothest the Lilies, wilt not neglect me (and mine.) That thou wilt make good thy own unfailing Promises, wilt give Meat to them that fear thee, and be ever

mindful of thy Covenant. In the mean time, let me not be querulous or impatient, or envious at the Prosperity of the wicked, or judge uncharitably of those to whom thou hast given a larger Portion of the Good things of this Life, or be cruel to those who are in the same Circumstances with my self. Let me never sink or despond under my heavy pressures and continued Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. Tho' I fall let me rise again, because the Lord taketh me up. Let my Heart ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be sunk so low that I should be afraid to own the Cause of despised Vertue. Give me Diligence, and Prudence, and Industry, and let me neglect nothing that lies in me to provide honestly for my own House, least I be worse than an Infidel. Help me carefully to examine my Life past, and if by my own Carelesness, or Imprudence, I have reduced my self into this low Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, let me be more deeply afflicted for it; but yet still hope in thy Goodness, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding those Failures whereof I have been formerly guilty.

                  <hi>A</hi> LETTER <hi>concerning the</hi> Religious Societies.</head>
               <opener>
                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>HAVING in Conversation acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally mentioned those <hi>Religious Societies</hi> which have been for some time erected in and about the Cities of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Westminster,</hi> and of late in some other places, you were pleased to desire a more particular Account concerning them, of their Orders, and manner of Life, and what my Thoughts were as to what we then heard objected against them.</p>
               <p>I must confess I have had the Curiosity to make a particular Enquiry about them, and the Informations I have received, have been from such Persons, as I think, I may entirely depend upon for the Truth of them, and what I have from them, I here very briefly give you, referring them for a larger Account to Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi>'s little Book on that Subject.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:106561:106"/>
In the first place, I find many Persons are in the same mistake which you were once in, and <hi>confound</hi> these <hi>Religious Societies</hi> with the <hi>Societies for Reformation,</hi> tho' they are quite different as to their <hi>Institution</hi> and <hi>immediate Ends,</hi> and for the most part, as to the <hi>Persons</hi> whereof they are composed. The immediate Business of the <hi>Societies</hi> for <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> is to assist the <hi>Civil Magistrates</hi> in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the <hi>Laws in Execution</hi> against <hi>Profaneness</hi> and <hi>Immorality,</hi> and consists of Sober Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of <hi>any Persuasion</hi> among Protestants, tho' most of them, as far as I can observe, of the <hi>Church of England:</hi> But the <hi>Religious Societies,</hi> as we call them for distinction from the other, are composed of such as meet together wholly upon a <hi>Religious Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi> to promote true <hi>Piety</hi> in themselves and others; and are all of them <hi>strict Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> none being admitted or suffered to continue, who are not <hi>constant Communicants:</hi> Many of these, indeed, are likewise engaged in the <hi>Business</hi> of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> and so on the other side, but this is only <hi>accidental,</hi> and these two are <hi>distinct Bodies</hi> of Men one from the other.</p>
               <p>I cannot tell, whether I can give you a better Character of those Persons who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose these <hi>Religious Societies,</hi> and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign
<pb facs="tcp:106561:106"/>
and Employment in them, than what <hi>Tertullian</hi> and other antient Writers have left us of the first Christians, in the best and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Ages of the Church: I am sure I cannot speak more Truth of them in fewer words.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>They often meet together, say the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents of those first Christians; <hi>ad confoederan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam Disciplinam;</hi> and to pray, and sing <hi>Hymns</hi> to Christ as God. We assemble our selves, says <hi>Tertullian,</hi> to the Repetition of the Holy Scriptures, we support our Faith by <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Discourse,</hi> we excite our Hope, we <hi>fix</hi> our Confidence, we encrease our Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, by the Exhortations of our Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers; we gather a Stock for the Poor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to every Man's ability, which we expend, not in riotous Feasting, but in helping the Indigent, and Orphans, and the Aged, and those who are persecuted for the Cause of God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is their <hi>Design</hi> and <hi>Employment</hi> in their Meetings, and for the <hi>Methods</hi> whereby they regulate them, they appear to be chosen with all Christian Prudence; but they are too <hi>large</hi> to be here inserted, and therefore I must again refer you to Mr. <hi>Woodward</hi>'s Book for a full Account of them.</p>
               <p>The main thing for which I am concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, is to give you my Reasons why I believe such <hi>Societies</hi> as these, if further propagated,
<pb facs="tcp:106561:107"/>
would be so far from being any Injury to the <hi>Church,</hi> as may be the Opinion of some Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons who either may not fully <hi>understand</hi> them, or are <hi>prejudiced</hi> against them, that I think, I can make it appear they would be of great <hi>Advantage</hi> to it.</p>
               <p>I know few good Men but <hi>lament</hi> that after the <hi>Destruction</hi> of <hi>Monasteries,</hi> there were not some <hi>Societies</hi> founded in their stead, but <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed</hi> from their <hi>Errors,</hi> and reduced to the <hi>Primitive Standard.</hi> None who has but lookt into our own Church History, can be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant how highly instrumental such. <hi>Bodies of Men</hi> as these, were to the first planting and propagating Christianity amongst our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers: 'Tis notorious that the <hi>first Monks</hi> wrought honestly for their Livings, and only met together at the <hi>Hours</hi> of Prayer, and necessary Refection, as do most of those in the <hi>Eastern Countries</hi> to this day: And those who read the Exemplary Piety of the old British Monks, and what indefatigable Pains they took, and what Hazards they ran in the Conversion of our Heathen Ancestors, as well as how stoutly they withstood the early. Encroachments of <hi>Rome,</hi> cannot but enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain an extraordinary Opinion of them, and will be apt to judge charitably of their great <hi>Austerities</hi> and <hi>Ascetic</hi> way of <hi>Living,</hi> tho' perhaps we may be in the right, when we
<pb facs="tcp:106561:107"/>
think they were in some things mistaken. However, this is certain, that a great part of the <hi>good Effects</hi> of that way of Life, may be attained without many of the <hi>Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of it, by such <hi>Societies</hi> as we are now discoursing of, which may be erected in the most populous Towns and Cities, without <hi>depriving</hi> the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> of the Service and Support of so many useful Members.</p>
               <p>It will be owned a desirable thing that we had among us some places wherein those who are religiously disposed might have the Liberty, for a Time, of a voluntary retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that they might escape the World, <hi>&amp; vacare Deo, &amp; sibimet ipsis.</hi> This was once practised with great Applause of all good Men, by Mr. <hi>Farrar,</hi> of which we have an account in Mr. <hi>Herbert</hi>'s Life, and a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger (as I have heard) in Bishop <hi>Hacket</hi>'s Life of Bishop <hi>Williams;</hi> and the same has been lately attempted by Mr. <hi>St</hi>—. But if this should not be <hi>practicable,</hi> at least ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, by Men of <hi>Trade</hi> and <hi>Business,</hi> tho' of never so devout Inclinations, I see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that could come nearer it, than these <hi>Religious Societies.</hi> The Design of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Person, Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> to have founded so many <hi>Collegiate Churches</hi> out of the broken Monaste<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ies, to consist of some <hi>Laity,</hi> as well as <hi>Clergy,</hi> seems to have had
<pb facs="tcp:106561:108"/>
something in it of the same Nature, (tho' in a higher degree) with that of these <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Societies</hi> now <hi>erected,</hi> namely, to make a <hi>stand</hi> for <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Virtue,</hi> so many <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubts</hi> against an encroaching World, where any might receive Counsel, and Advice, who addressed themselves unto them; but since we were not so happy to have this accomplished, Why may not these Societies in some measure supply the want of them? For if they were once erected in the most <hi>considerable Towns</hi> and <hi>populous Villages,</hi> or where <hi>one</hi> was not large enough, out of more neighbouring Villages united, they might be able notably to assist the <hi>Rural Deans,</hi> where there are any, and in some measure supply their <hi>Want</hi> where there are none: and would not this disarm that Objection against <hi>Diocesan Episcopaey,</hi> which is brought from the <hi>extent</hi> of its <hi>Iurisdiction?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, if this be <hi>ultra crepidam,</hi> it's cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that this would hold of <hi>Parish Priests,</hi> and they would, as some have already done, soon find extraordinary Advantages by it. There are a great many Parishes in this Kingdom, which consist of <hi>several Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands,</hi> some of some <hi>Myriads</hi> of Souls: Now, what one Man, or two, or three, is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient for such a multitude? What Strength to visit them? What Memory, unless very
<pb facs="tcp:106561:108"/>
extraordinary, to retain but their Names? Those who have but one or two thousand, will find their Cares heavy enough, especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly now they have neither the <hi>Catechists</hi> of the Antients to assist them, nor those <hi>Clerks</hi> which are mentioned in the Rubrick, and seem to have been designed for that End, at the Reformation: And may not we say of these great Numbers, as the Disciples did to our Saviour when they saw the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes, <hi>from whence shall we buy Bread, that these may eat?</hi> But would not these things be rendred much more easie to the careful Pastor; when such considerable Bodies should act [in <hi>Subordination</hi> to him, and with <hi>Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi> from him,] to promote those great Ends, for which he has so solemnly dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted himself to God? They would be as so many Church-Wardens, or Overseers, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Deacons under him, caring for the Sick and Poor, giving him an account of the Spiritual Estate of themselves and others; persuading <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Sureties</hi> to Catechise their Children, and fitting them for Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; discoursing with those who have already left the Church, to bring them back to it, or who are tempted to leave it, in order to preserve them in it; the effect whereof we may guess by the contrary, there being, it's likely, <hi>Ten,</hi> who are persuaded to leave
<pb facs="tcp:106561:109"/>
the Church by their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> to <hi>one,</hi> who is immediately wrought upon by the <hi>Dissent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Teachers.</hi> This assistance would in all probability conduce as much to the <hi>Health</hi> of the Minister's <hi>Body,</hi> by easing him of many a weary step and fruitless Journey, as to the great satisfaction of his <hi>Mind,</hi> in the visible Success of his Labours. In short, it seems a necessary Consequence, both from what <hi>Success</hi> the Design has already had, and from the very Nature of it, that if it went forward in such manner, and with such Limitations as are proposed, it would be so far from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring the Church, that these <hi>several Societies</hi> would be so many <hi>new Bulwarks</hi> against its Enemies, would give it daily more Strength, and Beauty, and Reputation, and it <hi>may be more than many wish to see it ever have.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And for the <hi>State,</hi> they might also be not inconsiderably serviceable to it, and highly promote Loyalty and Obedience, as well as all other Parts of Religion and Virtue.</p>
               <p>There is hardly any considerable Design, but may be carried on with much greater Success, by <hi>united Bodies</hi> of Men, than by single Persons. We see it in <hi>Trades</hi> every day; and why should we not learn from those who are <hi>wise in their Generation?</hi> We see what a wide Progress, Heresie and Infidelity have made by their poisonous <hi>Clubs</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations:</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:106561:109"/>
The very <hi>Players</hi> are formed into <hi>Companies,</hi> or they could not be half so mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Morality:</hi> The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> owes, perhaps, her very <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence,</hi> at least, most of the <hi>Progress</hi> she has made of late Years, to those several <hi>Societies</hi> she nourishes in her Bosom: Why may not we learn from <hi>Enemies;</hi> and what better way than to fight with their <hi>own Weapons?</hi> At least, why may not we have <hi>Congrogations</hi> to propagate <hi>Good Manners,</hi> as they have one to propagate their <hi>Ill Faith?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, it must be owned there have been some devout Persons among them, who by this very method of forming lesser <hi>Religious Societies</hi> in Towns and Villages, as well as the greater Cities, have done great Things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Reformation of Manners,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Virtue.</hi> The Noble and Pious Monsieur <hi>de Renty,</hi> in <hi>France</hi> was of this Number: He employed much of his time in this happy Exercise, particularly at <hi>Caen,</hi> where he settled many <hi>Societies</hi> of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Persons, to meet Weekly, and consult about the Relief of the Poor, and prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Offences</hi> against God, which succeeded to admiration: He did the same among <hi>Tradesmen,</hi> both at <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Tolose,</hi> whom he brought constantly to go to Prayers, sing Psalms, read Books of Devotion, and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course
<pb facs="tcp:106561:110"/>
of their spiritual Concerns one with another; and used all his Interest with Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of his acquaintance to erect <hi>petty So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties</hi> of the same Nature, even in lesser Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, where they had any Influence over the Inhabitants <note n="*" place="margin">See his Life, <hi>p.</hi> 149, 155, 158, 159.</note>. And why should we not <hi>transplant</hi> any <hi>excellent Fruit</hi> into our own <hi>Soil,</hi> and get all the good we can from Persons of all Communions?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Publick Assemblies,</hi> in the Church, tho' con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly and devoutly attended by the <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers</hi> of these <hi>Societies,</hi> yet must be owned to be improper, on several Accounts, for those excellent <hi>Ends</hi> which they propose in their stated meetings: 'Tis not there proper to <hi>discourse</hi> of many things which fall under their Care, nor is there any room for <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Conversation,</hi> if it were <hi>decent</hi> to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise it. <hi>Pious Discourse</hi> must be owned as necessary as it is a delightful Employment to all good Christians, and yet what more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally and shamefully neglected, and even by the <hi>accursed Rules</hi> of <hi>Civility,</hi> exploded out of the World. This Practice, that late ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Person, Dr. <hi>Goodman,</hi> has endeavoured to <hi>retrieve,</hi> and has recommended it in so <hi>charming</hi> a manner in his <hi>Winter-Evening Conference,</hi> that he would not have failed of
<pb facs="tcp:106561:110"/>
making many <hi>Converts</hi> to it, had there been <hi>Virtue</hi> enough left in the World to make use of his Directions: Now if this <hi>Religious Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course</hi> be lawful and commendable where it is <hi>accidental,</hi> or among a <hi>few Persons</hi> only, I would fain know how it should come to be otherwise when it is <hi>stated</hi> and <hi>regulated,</hi> and among a <hi>greater Number?</hi> Is it any more a <hi>Conventicle</hi> than any other <hi>Meetings?</hi> Is there any <hi>Law</hi> that it offends against? Is it any greater Crime to meet and <hi>sing Psalms</hi> together, than to sing <hi>profane Songs,</hi> or waste Hours in impertinent <hi>Chat</hi> or <hi>Drinking?</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, one would almost wonder how a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of this Nature should come to have <hi>any, Enemies,</hi> nor can I see any Reason why good Men should be discouraged from joyning in it by those hard words, <hi>Faction, Singularity,</hi> and the like, when all possible Care is taken to give no just Offence in the management of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Design</hi> of these <hi>Societies,</hi> as I am sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied by considering the first <hi>Founder,</hi> and the <hi>Encouragers</hi> of them, and their <hi>Rules</hi> as well as <hi>Practice,</hi> is, by no means to <hi>gather Churches</hi> out of <hi>Churches,</hi> to foment <hi>New Schisms</hi> and <hi>Divisions,</hi> and to make <hi>Heathens</hi> of all the rest of their <hi>Christian Brethren;</hi> which would be as <hi>indefensible</hi> in it self, as dangerous and <hi>fatal</hi> in its Consequences both
<pb facs="tcp:106561:111"/>
to themselves and others: So far are they from this, that they have <hi>brought back</hi> seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to the Church who were divided from it; but their aim is purely, and only to promote, in a regular manner, that which is the <hi>End</hi> of every <hi>Christian,</hi> the <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> included in the Welfare and Salvation of themselves and their Neighbours; and if any rational Method could be proposed, besides those they have already pitched upon, to guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these <hi>possible Inconveniencies,</hi> there is no doubt but they would embrace it. Tho' after all, how there can possibly be any <hi>occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> of <hi>Schism,</hi> any <hi>crevice</hi> for it to creep in at, where nothing is done but in <hi>Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the <hi>lawful Ministry,</hi> and by <hi>Direction</hi> from it, and where one of the very <hi>Bonds</hi> of the <hi>Society</hi> is the <hi>constant</hi> frequenting of <hi>publick Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Communions,</hi> while on the other side, there is no visible private <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest</hi> to serve, no <hi>Faction</hi> to flatter or hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, I must confess I am not sharp-sighted enough to discern, and dare challenge any <hi>Instance</hi> of a <hi>Schism</hi> any where occasioned, in such circumstances, ever since the <hi>Birth of Christianity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It cannot be denied but that there may, and will be some Persons in these Societies of more <hi>Heat</hi> than <hi>Light,</hi> more <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Warmth,</hi> than <hi>Iudgment</hi> and <hi>Discretion;</hi> but
<pb facs="tcp:106561:111"/>
where was ever any <hi>Body of Men</hi> without some of such a <hi>Character?</hi> They are of <hi>like Passions</hi> with other Men, and why may not they expect the same <hi>Allowances?</hi> But since the very <hi>Rules</hi> of their Institution do strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oblige them to the Practice of <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> and to avoid <hi>Censoriousness</hi> and <hi>spiritual Pride,</hi> the common Rocks of those who make a <hi>more than ordinary Profession of Religion.</hi> I see not what <hi>humane Prudence</hi> can provide any farther in this matter.</p>
               <p>I had like to have forgot one consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Advantage of these <hi>Religious Societies,</hi> if they should once come to be more common amongst us, and that is, that out of them it would be easie to form <hi>Societies for Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> for Persons must be first <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> concerned for <hi>Religion</hi> themselves, before they are likely to be so concerned for <hi>others,</hi> as to be willing to <hi>sacrifice</hi> all to make them better. That there is <hi>need</hi> of a general <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of Manners,</hi> has not been denied even by those who have had the most <hi>need</hi> of it themselves: And that the <hi>Governours</hi> both in Church and State, do most earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>desire</hi> it, we can no less doubt without the highest Affront to both, when they have by so many <hi>repeated Acts,</hi> solemnly declared as much to the Nation. That a <hi>firm Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> of good Men, is the best way to bring
<pb facs="tcp:106561:112"/>
this Design to a good Issue, we may more than guess by what has been already done by such methods; And for all the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions which have been brought against those who have embarkt in this pious and generous Undertaking, I believe there is no unprejudiced Person who has read the Right Reverend Bishop of <hi>Glocester</hi>'s Defence of them, but are fully satisfied that they have but very little weight, and are there fairly answered. And as it is known that the late Archbishop was a hearty Friend of them, and their Design, so his most Reverend Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor has given them a just and noble Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation in his Letter to the Bishops of his Province, wherein he requires them, <q>To press the <hi>Clergy</hi> of their respective Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceses, to invite their Church-wardens and other pious Persons among the Laity, to <hi>ioyn with them</hi> in carrying on the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Manners; after which he adds, [We may very reasonably expect the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Effects of such a <hi>Concurrence,</hi> from the <hi>visible Success</hi> of that <hi>noble Zeal</hi> wherewith so many about the great Cities do promote true Piety and a Reformation of Manners.]</q> Thus far our most Reverend Metropolitan, and since that time, the same Design has been publickly espoused and recommended by several others of the <hi>highest Character.</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:106561:112"/>
And indeed, if the <hi>General Reformation</hi> of Mens Manners be ever effected by the <hi>Terror</hi> of the Laws without <hi>Execution,</hi> or those Laws be ever <hi>effectually executed</hi> by the <hi>straggling Endeavours</hi> of a few good Men, who charge <hi>singly</hi> against such infernal Hosts of <hi>Infidelity</hi> and <hi>Lewdness;</hi> if any thing considerable here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in be accomplished, unless by such a <hi>Combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> I shall own my self happily mistaken; but whether I am or no, the <hi>Event</hi> will teach <hi>Posterity.</hi> I shall conclude this long Letter with the remarkable words of the excellent Author of the <hi>Whole Duty of Man,</hi> in his Causes of the Decay of the Christian Piety, the close of the Twentieth Chapter.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That <hi>Scandal,</hi> says he, which we have brought upon our Religion, as it was not contracted by the Irregularities of <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two</hi> Persons, but by <hi>associated</hi> and <hi>common Crimes,</hi> so neither will it be removed by a few <hi>single</hi> and private Reformations. There must be <hi>Combinations,</hi> and <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Confederacies</hi> in Virtue, to balance and counterpoise those of Vice, or they will never recover that Honour which she acquired by the <hi>general Piety</hi> of her Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors.</q> He goes on; <q>In those Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Days, there was such an abhorrence of all that was ill, that a vicious Person was lookt upon as a kind of a <hi>Monster</hi> or

                     <hi>Prodigy,</hi> and like a putrified Member cut off, as being not only dangerous but noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to the Body: But, alas! the Scene is so changed, that the Church is now <hi>made up</hi> of such as she would then have <hi>cast out,</hi> and 'tis now as remarkable an Occurrent to find a <hi>Good Christian,</hi> as it was then to see a <hi>Bad.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I shall add no more, but that it was well the Worthy Author concealed his Name, when he published such disobliging Truths: At least, if he had been now living, he would scarce have escaped the Censure of <hi>Forwardness,</hi> and a <hi>Zeal</hi> not according to <hi>Knowledge.</hi>

                  </hi> (according to our <hi>Catechism)</hi> was the <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>Baptism,</hi> tho' neither of them are, I think, <hi>expresly determined</hi> in <hi>Scripture,</hi> either by <hi>Precept,</hi> or such <hi>Example</hi> as clearly proves it; or by the <hi>force</hi> or <hi>meaning</hi> of the word <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise.</hi> Nay, there are several places in the <hi>Sacred Scripture</hi> which make it very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they did <hi>wash,</hi> or <hi>sprinkle,</hi> as well as <hi>dip</hi> or <hi>plunge</hi> the <hi>baptised,</hi> and we have In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of it in the known <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>antient Churches.

               <p>§ XIV. Our <hi>Grounds</hi> for <hi>Baptising</hi> the <hi>Infants,</hi> (at least) of <hi>believing Parents,</hi> are such as these. 1. Because all Children are guilty of <hi>original Sin,</hi> and consequently can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be <hi>saved</hi> in an ordinary way, unless that be <hi>washt</hi> away in <hi>Baptism.</hi> 2. Because such Children are <hi>capable</hi> of making a <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant,</hi> and <hi>were,</hi> and still <hi>are</hi> under the <hi>Evangelical Covenant,</hi> and consequently have a right to <hi>Baptism,</hi> which is the <hi>initiating Seal</hi> thereof. 3. Because they <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to <hi>come</hi> to <hi>Christ,</hi> are capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing admitted into the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and of solemn sacramental <hi>Dedication</hi> to him. 4. Because the <hi>Iews</hi> did make <hi>Proselytes</hi>
                  <pb n="215" facs="tcp:106561:126"/>
of Children by <hi>baptising</hi> as well as by <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcising</hi> them; and consequently, our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour</hi> commanding his <hi>Disciples</hi> to make <hi>Proselytes</hi> out of all Nations by <hi>Baptism,</hi> and not forbidding them to receive <hi>Children,</hi> they must needs <hi>baptise</hi> them also. 5. It is very probable, if not positively certain, from the <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> that the <hi>Apostles</hi> did <hi>baptise Infants.</hi> 6. As it is certain that the <hi>first Christians</hi> did so, and the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> have continued to do it, in all <hi>Places</hi> and all <hi>Ages.</hi>

The first Argument for <hi>Infants Baptism,</hi> may be taken from their being guilty of <hi>original Sin,</hi> and consequently, in an <hi>ordinary way</hi> they cannot be <hi>saved,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less that be <hi>washed away</hi> by <hi>Baptism.</hi> That there is such a thing as this <hi>original Guilt</hi> or <hi>Stain</hi> of our Natures, see <hi>Section</hi> VI. where it is also proved, that it is in it self <hi>damnable,</hi> as it must certainly be, if it makes us the <hi>Children of Wrath;</hi> and if the <hi>Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence</hi> of the first <hi>Adam</hi> has rendred all <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind</hi> obnoxious to <hi>Iudgment,</hi> to <hi>Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and to <hi>Death.</hi> It is true, the second <hi>Adam</hi> has found a <hi>Remedy</hi> by his own <hi>Death,</hi> but the <hi>Merits</hi> thereof are only to be applied in the use of those <hi>means</hi> he has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, the chief of which are the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                  <pb n="216" facs="tcp:106561:127"/>
All good Christians believe <hi>one Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> for the <hi>Remission of Sins;</hi> we being therein <hi>born again,</hi> not of <hi>corruptible Seed,</hi> but of <hi>incorruptible.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">1 St. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23.</note> 
                  <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism</hi> is the <hi>ordinary way,</hi> to which God has <hi>tied</hi> us, tho' he may not have <hi>tied</hi> himself. Where it is <hi>not to be had</hi> indeed, the <hi>Case</hi> is <hi>different,</hi> but what are <hi>extraordinary Cases</hi> against a certain standing <hi>Rule?</hi> That <hi>origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Sin</hi> is really <hi>washt</hi> away in <hi>Baptism,</hi> has been already proved; and that the same has been the <hi>unanimous Opinion</hi> of the <hi>antient Churches:</hi> And on that account, we think we have great Reason to <hi>baptise Infants,</hi> as did the <hi>Holy Fathers</hi> of old, that they may thereby be made <hi>Inheritors of the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XVI. A second Argument for the <hi>Lawfulness</hi> of <hi>Infant's Baptism,</hi> is, because they are capable of making a <hi>Covenant,</hi> and <hi>were,</hi> and still <hi>are,</hi> under the <hi>Evangelical Covenant,</hi> and consequently have a <hi>right</hi> to <hi>Baptism,</hi> which is the <hi>entring Seal</hi> there of.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Infants</hi> are capable of entring into a <hi>Covenant,</hi> I prove from <hi>God</hi>'s own Words to the People of <hi>Israel,</hi> Deut. 29. 10, 11, 12. <q>Ye stand this day all of you before the Lord

                  <hi>God</hi> would never have <hi>made</hi> a <hi>Covenant</hi> with <hi>Little Ones,</hi> if they had not been <hi>capable</hi> of it; 'tis not said <hi>Children</hi> only, but <hi>Little Ones</hi> (such as Christ particularly orders his <hi>Disciples</hi> to suffer to come to him, of which more below) and is translated in the <hi>Greek</hi> by a word that sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>Infants,</hi> or <hi>Innocents</hi>

                  <note n="†" place="margin">Galat. 3. 15.</note>; and surely, we may follow his <hi>Example.

The <hi>Infants</hi> of <hi>Believers,</hi> the <hi>true Children</hi> of faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> always were under the <hi>Gospel Covenant.</hi> They were <hi>included</hi> in it, they had a <hi>right</hi> unto it, and to the <hi>Seal</hi> of it; as an <hi>Heir</hi> has <hi>right</hi> to an <hi>Estate,</hi> an <hi>Infant Prince</hi> to a <hi>Crown,</hi> tho' there are some <hi>Solemnities</hi> required to give them <hi>Investiture,</hi> and <hi>actual Possession</hi> of them.

               </p>
               <p>§ XVII. A <hi>Third Argument</hi> for the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising</hi> of <hi>Infants</hi> is, because they <hi>may,</hi> and <hi>ought</hi> to be made <hi>Proselytes;</hi> they ought to <hi>come to Christ,</hi> being capable of <hi>admission</hi> into the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and consequently of <hi>solemn, sacramental Dedication</hi> to him.</p>
               <p>That <hi>Infants</hi> ought to be made <hi>Proselytes,</hi> or which is the same, <hi>to come to Christ,</hi> is evident from his own words, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 14. 13, 14. <q>They brought <hi>little Children</hi> to <hi>Christ</hi> and the Disciples rebuked them. And Jesus said, suffer <hi>little Children</hi> to <hi>come</hi> unto me, and <hi>forbid</hi> them not, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.</q> Which is carried yet farther by St. <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 18. <q>They brought unto him <hi>also</hi> (it should be render'd <hi>even) Infants,</hi> that he should touch them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> And again, St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 2. and onward. <q>He called a <hi>little Child,</hi> and said, except ye be converted and become as <hi>little Children,</hi> ye shall not enter into the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven.</hi>
                  </q> And <hi>ver.</hi> 5. <q>Whosoever shall receive one such <hi>little Child</hi> in my Name, receives me.</q> 6. <q>But whoso shall offend one of <hi>these little ones</hi> which <hi>believe</hi> in me, it were better for him that a Mill-stone were
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:106561:130"/>
hanged about his Neck, and that he were drowned in the debth of the Sea.</q> In which place our <hi>Saviour</hi> having spoken of <hi>little Children, Infants, Children in Age,</hi> in all the former part of his <hi>Discourse,</hi> and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly mentioned them <hi>four times</hi> one after another, it cannot be reasonably sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed that he should all of the sudden change the <hi>Sense</hi> of the word, and speak of <hi>little Children</hi> in a <hi>metaphorical</hi> or <hi>figurative Sense</hi> in the sixth Verse, when he says that they <hi>believed</hi> in him. These <hi>Children</hi> were so <hi>little,</hi> that they were <hi>brought</hi> to him, which yet our <hi>Saviour</hi> says, did <hi>come</hi> unto him; so <hi>little,</hi> that he took them up in his <hi>Arms.</hi> And yet he <hi>rebuked</hi> his <hi>Disciples</hi> for end<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to hinder their <hi>coming</hi> unto him. Christ's <hi>Command</hi> respected the <hi>future</hi> as well as <hi>present:</hi> his <hi>Disciples</hi> or <hi>Ministers</hi> are still to suffer <hi>Infants</hi> to <hi>come,</hi> that is, to be <hi>brought</hi> unto <hi>Christ.</hi> They cannot now <hi>come</hi> unto him, but by being <hi>brought</hi> unto the <hi>Church,</hi> by being made <hi>Proselytes</hi> to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</hi> They cannot do this but by <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism,</hi> therefore they ought to be <hi>baptised.</hi> 
                  <q>For of <hi>such</hi> is the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> or of <hi>God;</hi>
                  </q> not of <hi>such</hi> only as were <hi>like</hi> these <hi>Infants,</hi> but of <hi>those very Infants,</hi> for if <hi>they themselves</hi> were not fit to be <hi>Subjects</hi> of that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> How could <hi>others</hi> be so, because
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:106561:131"/>
they were <hi>like</hi> them? <q>But except a <hi>Man</hi> be born of <hi>Water</hi> and of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God.</q> 
                  <hi>Infants</hi> are therefore capable of being thus born in <hi>Holy Baptism.</hi> They are capable of being <hi>admitted</hi> into the <hi>Church,</hi> and have a <hi>right</hi> unto it. They were in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> under the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> being admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by <hi>Circumcision,</hi> nor are we to suppose that they are in a <hi>worse Condition</hi> under the <hi>Gospel,</hi> than they were under the <hi>Law;</hi> nor would our <hi>Saviour,</hi> surely, take away any <hi>Privileges</hi> which they enjoyed, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther make <hi>Additions</hi> to them. He, indeed, actually commands his <hi>Disciples</hi> to admit <hi>Children</hi> as <hi>Proselytes,</hi> when he <hi>bids</hi> them suffer <hi>such to come unto him.</hi> The <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>believing Parents</hi> have a <hi>right</hi> to the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven,</hi> therefore to <hi>admission</hi> into the <hi>Church,</hi> and consequently to <hi>Baptism,</hi> there being no other way of admitting them. Again, <hi>Christ</hi> here expressly stiles them <hi>Believers;</hi> 
                  <q> one of <hi>these little ones</hi> which <hi>believe</hi> in me:</q> Why therefore, should not the <hi>Infants</hi> of <hi>Believers</hi> be thought ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of the <hi>beginnings,</hi> of the first <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> as well as of <hi>Reason;</hi> and therefore of <hi>Baptism,</hi> according to our Adversary's own <hi>Argument?</hi> They are said to have <hi>Holiness</hi> as well as <hi>Faith;</hi>

                     <hi>Children</hi> are <hi>Holy,</hi>

               <p>§ XVIII. A sourth Argument for the <hi>Baptising</hi> of <hi>Infants</hi> is, because the <hi>Iews</hi> did make <hi>Proselytes</hi> of <hi>Children</hi> by <hi>Baptism,</hi> as well as by <hi>Circumcision,</hi> and consequently our <hi>Saviour</hi> commanding his <hi>Disciples</hi> to gather <hi>Proselytes</hi> out of all <hi>Nations</hi> by <hi>Baptising</hi> them, and not <hi>forbidding</hi> them to receive <hi>Children</hi> as well as <hi>others,</hi> they must needs <hi>baptise</hi> Children also.</p>
               <p>That the <hi>Iews</hi> did certainly admit <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selytes</hi> by <hi>Baptism,</hi> as well as by <hi>Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion,</hi> and that <hi>whole Families</hi> together, <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi>

as well as their <hi>Parents;</hi> we have the unanimous <hi>Testimony</hi> of their most ancient, learned, and authentic Writers, as has been abundantly made good by Dr. <hi>Hammond,</hi> Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> and others, who have laboured on this Subject. The <hi>Males</hi> they received by <hi>Baptism</hi> and <hi>Circumcision;</hi> the <hi>Women,</hi> by <hi>Baptism</hi> only, which includes a sufficient Answer to a little Cavil against the suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding of <hi>Baptism</hi> in the room of <hi>Circumcision.</hi> That this is not a <hi>novel Custom,</hi> which the <hi>Iews</hi> have learnt from the <hi>Christians,</hi> we may be satisfied by their <hi>inveterate hatred</hi> against them, and especially against their <hi>Sacraments.</hi> Besides, they themselves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce this <hi>Practice</hi> from the <hi>Old Testament,</hi> from <hi>Iacob</hi>'s commanding all his <hi>Houshold</hi> to be <hi>clean,</hi> and change their <hi>Garments,</hi> wherein were included the <hi>Maid Servants,</hi> those <hi>Captives</hi> which his Sons took from <hi>Sechem,</hi> and others. <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 24. 24. 25. 2.</note> And the same <hi>Custom</hi> it's said they continue to this day, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>Proselytes</hi> by <hi>Baptism,</hi> as well as by <hi>Circumcision.</hi> As for the <hi>Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,</hi> it seems unavoidable, unless the <hi>Matter of Fact</hi> could be disproved, on which it is grounded Nay, it would hold firm, were it from <hi>Circumcision</hi> only, which has been proved to <hi>succeed</hi> Baptism. For if it was
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:106561:132"/>
the <hi>Custom</hi> of the <hi>Iews,</hi> when they gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Proselytes</hi> out of all <hi>Nations,</hi> to admit <hi>Children</hi> among others by <hi>Circumcision,</hi> tho' they could not actually signify their <hi>Belief</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> nor promise <hi>Obedience</hi> to it; then the <hi>Apostles</hi> who were sent to make <hi>Proselytes</hi> to <hi>Christianity</hi> by <hi>Baptism,</hi> could never think of excluding <hi>Children,</hi> whom the <hi>Iews</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>admitted,</hi> (seeing the <hi>Reason</hi> for their <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission</hi> was the same in both cases,) unless our <hi>Saviour</hi> had expresly forbidden it. If it be asked wherefore <hi>Infants</hi> are not as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of <hi>receiving</hi> the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> as of <hi>Baptism,</hi> we answer, that the <hi>Reason</hi> is plain, because the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> is a <hi>confirming Seal, Baptism</hi> only the <hi>entring Seal</hi> of the <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> by which <hi>Children</hi> may now be <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted</hi> into it, as they were of old by <hi>Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision.</hi> But we may argue more strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the <hi>Apostles</hi> did <hi>admit Children</hi> for <hi>Proselytes</hi> by <hi>Baptism,</hi> as well as we know they <hi>admitted Women,</hi> tho' neither of them actually mentioned in their <hi>Commission,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was the <hi>Custom</hi> of their <hi>Country</hi> to do both, and neither was <hi>forbidden</hi> by our <hi>Saviour:</hi> As if any of our <hi>Ministers</hi> goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Heathens,</hi> and converts them, he would certainly <hi>baptise Infants,</hi> and give the other <hi>Sacrament</hi> in both <hi>kinds</hi> to the

               <p>§ XIX. A fifth Argument for the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tising</hi> of <hi>Infants,</hi> is because it is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if not positively certain, that the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> themselves did <hi>baptise</hi> them. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing those <hi>two</hi> Instances of <hi>Baptising</hi> Women had not been recorded in the <hi>Acts of the Apostles,</hi> yet we might fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have concluded, that when so many <hi>Thousands,</hi> so many entire <hi>Housholds</hi> were baptised, <hi>Women</hi> were not excluded, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when it was the known <hi>Custom</hi> of the <hi>Iews</hi> to admit them <hi>Proselytes</hi> by <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism:</hi> and the same holds of <hi>Children,</hi> nay, more strongly, on the account of <hi>Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision:</hi> 
                  <q>three Thousand were <hi>baptised</hi> in <hi>one</hi>

<pb n="230" facs="tcp:106561:134"/>
already mentioned, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 38. thus he exhorts, <q>Repent and be <hi>baptised every one of you,</hi> in the Name of Jesus Christ for the Remission of Sins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> For the <hi>Promise</hi> is to <hi>you,</hi> and to <hi>your Children.</hi>
                  </q> The Answer was indeed to those <hi>adult Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> who ask'd, What shall we do? These he bids <hi>Repent</hi> and be <hi>baptised;</hi> but it reacht further than to those that made the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion; and tho' <hi>Children</hi> could not actually <hi>Repent,</hi> yet they might be <hi>baptised;</hi> and there are two things in the words which shew they were here included. 1.

               <p>§ XX. The last Argument for <hi>bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> of <hi>Infants,</hi> may be taken from the general <hi>Practice</hi> of the <hi>Christian Church,</hi> in all <hi>Places,</hi> and all <hi>Ages</hi> since the first planting of <hi>Christianity.</hi> For the <hi>Truth</hi>

                  </q> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> is likewise clear for it, and a whole <hi>Council</hi> with him, as appears in his Epistle to <hi>Fidus,</hi> and other places.

<pb n="232" facs="tcp:106561:135"/>
Children's <hi>Baptism,</hi> from their being guilty of <hi>original Sin.</hi> And even <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> is for having them <hi>baptised</hi> in <hi>mere Infancy,</hi> in case of <hi>Danger,</hi> which he founds on the <hi>Circumcision</hi> on the <hi>eighth day;</hi> and tho' in no <hi>Danger,</hi> he would not have it <hi>deferred</hi> till they were <hi>above</hi> three Year old. Tho' even this was a <hi>singular Opinion</hi> of his, but such as does <hi>no</hi> Service to the Cause of the <hi>Antipoedobaptists,</hi> since they are for <hi>baptising adult Persons</hi> only. <hi>Siricius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> about the middle of the <hi>fourth Century,</hi> was for the <hi>baptising</hi> of <hi>Infants.</hi> So was St. <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose.</hi> And to go higher, tho' <hi>Tertullian</hi> seems to have been much of the same mind with <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> as to the <hi>delaying</hi> their <hi>Baptism,</hi> yet his very <hi>Advice</hi> in this <hi>matter,</hi> fairly implys, that it was then the <hi>general Custom</hi> to <hi>baptise Infants.</hi> And he in other places affirms that of <hi>Baptism,</hi> which is a <hi>sound Argument</hi> for admitting <hi>Infants</hi> to it, namely, that it is <hi>necessary to Salvation,</hi> and that without it, <hi>none can enter into Heaven. Iustin Martyr</hi> says, that the <hi>outward Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision</hi> which was to be performed on the <hi>eighth day,</hi> was a <hi>Type</hi> of the <hi>true Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision;</hi> that <hi>Christians</hi> received this <hi>true spiritual Circumcision</hi> by <hi>Baptism,</hi> thro' <hi>God's Mercy,</hi> we having <hi>need</hi> of it, because all

                  <note n="†" place="margin">See this elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately handled by Mr. <hi>Walker</hi> in his excellent Treatise of <hi>Infant-Baptism.</hi>

an <hi>holy Life;</hi> but this no more shows the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring</hi> of <hi>Baptism</hi> to have been the received <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> than it is the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> that People may without <hi>Sin</hi> absent themselves from the other <hi>Sacrament,</hi> because too many actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do it, and 'tis to be feared for the same <hi>Reason,</hi> namely, lest they should be <hi>obliged to forsake their Sins,</hi> and lead a <hi>better Life.</hi> But this, we affirm, that there is not <hi>one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> to be found in <hi>Antiquity</hi> of any <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox Christian,</hi> who denied <hi>Baptism</hi> to <hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> when brought to be <hi>baptised;</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we may be positive that not one of the Fathers, or antient Writers, for the first Eight Hundred Years at least, ever held it <hi>unlawful.</hi> And that it has been the <hi>Practice</hi> of all the <hi>regular Churches</hi> ever since, is as clear and manifest, whereas we know that whenever the <hi>Popish Errors</hi> were brought into the <hi>Church,</hi> they were neither early, nor universally received. For, not only our own <hi>Ancestors</hi> when first converted to <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity,</hi> not only all our <hi>European</hi> Churches, but the <hi>African</hi> too, formerly did, and still do <hi>baptise</hi> their <hi>Children,</hi> both the <hi>Coptis</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and the <hi>Abyssines</hi> in <hi>Ethiopia;</hi> as well as the <hi>Churches</hi> of <hi>Asia,</hi> and even those of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> who had for many Ages, scarce any <hi>Correspondence</hi> with our Parts
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:106561:136"/>
of the World. The <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Fact</hi> being thus cleared, we may reasonably conclude from it, that since <hi>Infant-Baptism</hi> has been generally <hi>received</hi> and <hi>practised</hi> by the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in <hi>all Places</hi> and <hi>Ages;</hi> since we can track it up as high as those who lived in the <hi>purest Ages</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> and were almost <hi>cotemporaries</hi> with some of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, (for <hi>Polycarp,</hi> who was <hi>Irenaeus</hi> his Master, lived in some part of the <hi>First Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury)</hi> for these Reasons we cannot think it <hi>unlawful,</hi> we must believe as St. <hi>Austin</hi> says, that it was certainly handed down from <hi>Christ</hi> and his <hi>Apostles,</hi> and that as it has now continued without interruption in the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>God</hi> for near <hi>Seventeen Hundred Years,</hi> so it will by <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>Grace</hi> continue therein, in like manner, to the <hi>End of the World.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary, it would follow that if <hi>Infant-Baprism</hi> were not true <hi>Baptism,</hi> there has been yet no <hi>true Church</hi> since our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,</hi> since there has been none which did not <hi>baptise Infants;</hi> no <hi>entire Church</hi> which has thought it unlawful, though some <hi>private Persons</hi> should have had <hi>private Opinions.</hi> Not even those of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> though it is true, they often <hi>delaid Baptism</hi> when they could not have it without the <hi>superstitious Appendages</hi> of the <hi>Romanists;</hi> and if there were any

sheltered amongst them who did wholly <hi>deny Baptism</hi> to <hi>Infants,</hi> they also denied <hi>Baptism</hi> it self, and the other <hi>Sacrament.</hi> I shall close this <hi>Head,</hi> and the whole <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> for <hi>Infant-Baptism,</hi> with this one <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark;</hi> That if there be no <hi>true Church</hi> but that of the <hi>Antipoedobaptists,</hi> that <hi>Promise</hi> has never yet been fulfilled, <q>That <hi>Kings should be nursing Fathers, and Queens nursing Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to the Church;</hi>
                  </q> for they never had but one <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> of their <hi>Opinion,</hi> and those they do not love to hear of: Now, we are not to think that <hi>God</hi> has <hi>forgotten this Promise</hi> for 1700 Years together; nor will they affirm it, there having been many excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes. Protectors</hi> of <hi>Churches,</hi> which have <hi>baptised Infants,</hi> and have been in their Infancy themselves <hi>baptised;</hi> whence it it follows, that <hi>Infant-Baptism</hi> is <hi>true Baptism,</hi> and that tthose are <hi>true Churches</hi> who use it if there ever yet were any since our <hi>Saviour.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>§ XXII. Having thus established the <hi>Truth</hi> in <hi>Controversie,</hi> I come to answer those <hi>Objections</hi> which are commonly brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst it, tho' indeed they may be all, or most of them easily answered from what has been already said, and an <hi>honest,</hi> and <hi>well meaning Christian,</hi> may be well esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished in the <hi>Faith,</hi> and yet not fit for <hi>doubtful Disputations,</hi> which are to be left to those who have more <hi>Learning, Time</hi> and <hi>Ability</hi> to manage them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:106561:139"/>
§ XXIII. I think their main <hi>Objection,</hi> and which they most frequently make use of, is drawn from the mistaken <hi>Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> and <hi>Application</hi> of our Saviour's words to his Disciples, in the 28 of St. <hi>Matthew</hi> and 19. <q>Go and <hi>teach</hi> all Nations, bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them in the Name of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Here, say they, <hi>Teaching</hi> is put before <hi>Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing</hi> whence they argue that all Persons ought to be <hi>taught</hi> before they are <hi>baptised,</hi> and that since <hi>Infants</hi> are uncapable of being <hi>taught,</hi> they are also uncapable of <hi>Baptism</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In answer, 1. The <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Words</hi> is no certain Rule for the Order of <hi>things,</hi> either in common <hi>Speech,</hi> or in <hi>Scripture:</hi> We u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually say, a Man was <hi>bred</hi> and <hi>born</hi> in such a place (and the <hi>Latins</hi> accordingly, <hi>nutrit, peperitque)</hi> by a common Figure: and many Instances of the same nature might be given from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> which as the <hi>Rabbies</hi> tell us, <q>speaks with the Tongue of the Sons of Men.</q> Instances we have of this in the first of St. <hi>Mark, v.</hi> 4. <q>
                     <hi>Iohn</hi> did baptise in the Wilderness, and preach the Baptism of Repentance.</q> Again, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <q>They were baptised of him in <hi>Iordan,</hi> confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing their Sins.</q> Now either the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Words</hi> in Scripture, does not always infer the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:106561:140"/>
same Order of <hi>Things,</hi> or else it follows that St. <hi>Iohn</hi> did <hi>baptise</hi> before he <hi>preached,</hi> and before his Hearers <hi>Confession</hi> and <hi>Repentance.</hi> Again, it is said in St. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 15. <q>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent and believe the Gospel.</q> But <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> does not always go before <hi>Faith,</hi> for <hi>Faith</hi> rather in order of <hi>Time</hi> as well as of <hi>Nature,</hi> precedes <hi>Repentance,</hi> because the <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief</hi> of the <hi>Promises,</hi> and <hi>Threatnings</hi> of the <hi>Gospel,</hi> is that which induces Sinners to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</hi> Last of all; the place is certainly <hi>mistranslated.</hi> For whereas we read, <q>Go and <hi>teach</hi> all Nations, baptising them.</q> And again, <hi>Teaching</hi> them to observe all things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which makes a plain <hi>Tautology,</hi> or improper and undecent Repetition of the <hi>same Word</hi> in the <hi>same Sense;</hi> it ought to be render'd, <q>Go and <hi>make Disciples</hi> of all Nations by <hi>Baptising</hi> them.</q> This is plain from the very <hi>Construction</hi> of the Words. <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>§ XXIV. Their next <hi>Objection</hi> is taken from those Expressions in <hi>Scripture,</hi> 
                  <q>Repent and be baptised; <hi>believe</hi> and be <hi>baptised.</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q>He that <hi>believes</hi> and is <hi>baptised</hi> shall be saved,</q> and the like; whence they argue, as before, that <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> are to go before <hi>Baptism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In answer; as to the <hi>order</hi> of the words, we have already proved that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it, tho' it is not denied, but that where a Person is <hi>capable</hi> of making an <hi>actual Declaration</hi> of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> he is obliged to do it before <hi>Baptism.</hi> And such were those <hi>adult,</hi> or <hi>grown Persons</hi> to whom the <hi>Gospel</hi> was at first preached, as <hi>Oral Profession</hi> was required by the <hi>Iews</hi> of <hi>adult Proselytes;</hi> and the same does our
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:106561:141"/>
                  <hi>Church</hi> require in the most <hi>solemn manner</hi> of those who are <hi>baptised</hi> when of <hi>riper Age.</hi> But neither <hi>God</hi> or <hi>Man</hi> require more of any than they are <hi>capable</hi> of <hi>performing:</hi> Nor is therefore such an <hi>actual personal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi> of their <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of <hi>Infants. Repentance,</hi> indeed, they need none, for any <hi>actual Sin; Faith</hi> they may have in <hi>Principle,</hi> tho' they cannot <hi>outwardly express</hi> it. This is therefore done by the <hi>Church</hi> in their <hi>Names,</hi> by the <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention</hi> of <hi>Sureties,</hi> who may lawfully and usefully <hi>stipulate</hi> for them, and they remain obliged by such a <hi>stipulation, Parents</hi> being <hi>naturally,</hi> these <hi>voluntarily</hi> bound to see to the <hi>pious Education</hi> of such <hi>Children,</hi> towards which they cannot have too <hi>many helps:</hi> And would all who have undertaken this <hi>solemn</hi> and <hi>weighty Charge,</hi> be but truly care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to <hi>perform</hi> it, which without <hi>grievous Sin,</hi> they cannot <hi>neglect,</hi> would they do what they <hi>promised</hi> for them, which surely is not <hi>impossible</hi> or very <hi>difficult</hi> to be done; would they <q>call upon these <hi>Children</hi> to hear <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> see that they learned their <hi>Catechism,</hi> and do their best to have them brought up in the <hi>Fear</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and fitted for <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation;</hi>

Vow</hi> upon themselves, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the other <hi>Sacrament,</hi> we should soon see another <hi>Face of Christianity</hi> among us, and I believe, few things would go further in silencing the <hi>Objections</hi> which are brought either against <hi>baptising Infants,</hi> or against our peculiar <hi>Form of Baptism.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ XXV. Another <hi>Objection</hi> against <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptism</hi> is, that there is no <hi>express Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> for it in <hi>Scripture;</hi> one <hi>positive Text,</hi> say they, would <hi>End</hi> all the <hi>Dispute.</hi> On which they <hi>argue</hi> farther, that <hi>God</hi> was <hi>angry</hi> with his own <hi>People</hi> because they did that, <q>which, says he, I <hi>commanded</hi> them not, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther came it not into my <hi>Heart;</hi>
                  </q> and the like in other places. <hi>Ier.</hi> 7. 31.</p>
               <p>In Answer, as to what they so often affirm, that one <hi>positive Text</hi> for <hi>Infant-Baptism</hi> would end the <hi>Controversie,</hi> we have great <hi>Reason</hi> to question the <hi>Truth</hi> of it; for it is as <hi>positively commanded</hi> in the <hi>New Testament</hi> (tho' were it only in the <hi>Old,</hi> and not a part of the <hi>cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial</hi> or <hi>political Law,</hi> none but <hi>Manichees</hi> would <hi>deny</hi> it, or a <hi>fair Consequence</hi> from it) it is, I say, as positively commanded, that <hi>Christians</hi> should <hi>teach</hi> and <hi>admonish.</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in <hi>Psalms</hi> and <hi>Hymns,</hi> and <hi>spiritual Songs, singing to the Lord with Grace in their Hearts,</hi> Ephes. 5. 14. as it is to <hi>Honour
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:106561:142"/>
our Father and Mother:</hi> But yet, these <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> absolutely <hi>refuse</hi> to do it, and they not only <hi>object</hi> against our <hi>way</hi> of <hi>singing,</hi> but they are against any outward <hi>singing</hi> at all, and never <hi>practise</hi> it in <hi>Religious Worship</hi> but are <hi>angry</hi> with us, and with some <hi>few</hi> of their <hi>own,</hi> who still keep up that most <hi>heavenly part of God's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Grantham</hi>'s Works, and Axe to the Root.</note>. So strange a <hi>Power</hi> has an <hi>inveterate Prejudice,</hi> which will neither <hi>yield</hi> to the <hi>Practice</hi> of all the <hi>Churches</hi> of God, nor to plain <hi>Scripture, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi> or <hi>Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to let that pass, as to their requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring an <hi>express Command</hi> for <hi>Infant-Baptism,</hi> we answer, it is <hi>unreasonable</hi> to ask it, when they themselves do <hi>practise</hi> some things for which there is neither <hi>Command,</hi> nor so much as any clear <hi>Example</hi> in the <hi>Holy Scripture;</hi> as for Instance, the <hi>change</hi> of the <hi>Sabbath;</hi> the <hi>admitting Women</hi> to the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> and even to <hi>Baptism,</hi> for which last, they have no <hi>express Command,</hi> and, I think, but <hi>one Example.</hi> For <hi>Baptism,</hi> they say that <hi>Women</hi> are included under <hi>all Nations,</hi> and we say the same of <hi>Children,</hi> but neither are <hi>expresly named.</hi> As for <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Women</hi> to the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> we are not <hi>sure</hi> from <hi>express Words</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> that
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:106561:142"/>
ever any <hi>Woman</hi> did <hi>receive</hi> it. They have in vain attempted to bring <hi>one express Text</hi> for it, tho' there is no more doubt that they did <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,</hi> than that the <hi>Apostles</hi> did <hi>baptise Infants.</hi> Nor can they evince any <hi>Example</hi> of <hi>Womens</hi> receiving from the first and second Chapters of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where it is said, <q>That the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> continued in <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Supplication</hi> with the <hi>Women;</hi> and afterwards, 'That those that <hi>believed</hi> continued daily with one accord in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and <hi>breaking Bread</hi> from <hi>House</hi> to <hi>House.</hi>
