            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g> haſt here a Diſcovery of one of the moſt inhumane and barbarous Murthers that any Age or Story can parallel, eſpecially if you conſider the Perſon who, the Place where, the manner how he was Murthered, and the Conſequences of them all.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Perſon, it was the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> one of the greateſt men in the three Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Son of the great <hi>Capell,</hi> who laid down his Life for the late King, and who himſelf had ſuſtained ſo many honourable and great Offices and Imployments in theſe Nations, filling up no leſs than a Vice-King-Ship, for many years in the Neighbour Nation, and as he was great in eminent Loyalty, excellent Qualifications, large Patrimony, and honourable Allyes, ſo no leſs a ſincere Lover of his King and Country, and a zelous Aſſertor of the Proteſtant Religion, and Intereſt againſt the curſed Machinations of the Popiſh Party, which was therefore become his Crime, and rendered him ſo obnoxious.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Place where he was Butchered, which was no other than in his Majeſties Royal Priſon and Palace, where (by deſign as it appears) he was brought the better to fall a Sacrifice to his Enemies. Being firſt lodged in the Lieutenants Houſe, then removed to his Slaughter-houſe Capt. <hi>Hawleys,</hi> and there kill'd the day after.) <hi>Where being now the Kings Priſoner, and out of his own defence, and for whom the King and Kingdom were reſpondent,</hi> as Sir <hi>Fran. Bacon</hi> obſerves in Sir <hi>Tho. Overberries</hi> Caſe, in the E. of <hi>Somerſets</hi> Tryal, <hi>was a thing that greatly aggravated the Fact, for certainly, ſaith he, Sir</hi> Tho O. <hi>was the firſt Man that was murthered in the</hi> Tower of London, <hi>ſave the Murther of the two young Princes, by the appointment of</hi> Richard <hi>the 3. this being it ſeems the ſecond,</hi> with this further Aggravation, that it was done at the very inſtant the K. himſelf was there in Perſon.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The manner how, <hi>viz.</hi> The Popiſh Conſpirators (his mortal Enemies) having thus gotten him within their reach, do by hired Cut-throat Villains and Traytors, moſt barbarouſly and Treacherouſly ſurprize, aſſault, and bloodily aſſaſſinate this great Worthy in his own Chamber; cutting his Throat, almoſt to the cutting off of his Neck, and afterwards by other Ruffians (and that against the K. expreſs Command) inhumanly drag, ſhamefully ſtrip him, and baſely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his naked Body to publick view. And as tho this was not ſufficient to ſatiate their malice and Blood-thirſtineſs, thus to murther his Perſon, they proceed (to the out-doing of <hi>Cain</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) to murther his Reputation, by charging their horrid Guilt upon himſelf; making him the Fellonious Self-murtherer: And purſuing to the utmoſt Revenge, Slaughter and Cruelty, any that ſhould dare to ſpeak the Truth, or contradict the ſame.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And as for the diſmal Conſequences, (ſome whereof have direfully appeared) which being unpoſſible to expreſs, is left to every ones Conſideration.</p>
            <p>But he who makes Inquifition for Blood, who ſees in ſecret, and brings to light the hidden Works of Darkneſs, hath by his Providence, greatly detected the ſame, both as to Perſons and things: Some Account whereof you have for your ſatisfaction, in the following compendiou<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That he was Murthered by others you have made good.</hi> 1. <hi>By undenyable Circumſtances.</hi> 2. <hi>By Poſitive Proofs offered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That the E. of <hi>E.</hi> did not Murther himſelf, as the Inqueſt declares: appears.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>From the Improbabilities that he ſhould ſo do;</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe of that excellent ſedate and well compoſed Natural temper he was well known to be of, and free from ſuch Melancholy and Frenſical fits, which might incline and expoſe him to ſuch a miſchief, what ever maliciouſly and falſly had been ſaid to the contrary.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe of that grace and fear of God, he was ſo eminently endowed with, which would ſecure him from ſuch impiety.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe of that abhorrency by Principle which he was well known to have of ſuch unnatural practiſes (whereof he could not ſpeak without great emotion of Spirit) what ever the better to colour the Murther, and fix it upon him, had heen moſt villanouſly reported, and ſpread abroad, to the contrary.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe of the careful Proviſion he made for his own preſervation, after he came into the <hi>Tower</hi> fearing the worſe, 1. By ſending for his own Silver Veſſel to dreſs his Meat in by his own People. 2. By that ſtore of all ſorts of Wine, he had ordered to be laid in for his own drinking. 3. By the direction he had given to his Servant, to take Notes of my Lord <hi>Ruſſels</hi> Tryal, that very day for his own uſe, all ample indications he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned ſelf preſervation; not ſelf deſtruction.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Becauſe, as his Conſcience was clear from any Treaſonable Guilt, (whatever to the contrary has moſt wickedly been ſuggeſted) ſo was he free from either Legal Witneſſes, or Conviction, there being no Bill of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictment found againſt him, as againſt others the day before, which might ſufficiently ſecure him from needleſs fears, or any ſuch deſperate courſe, tho had his zeal and affection to his King, Country, and Religion, (whom he might apprehend to have been in danger) tranſported him to any irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity, his Fathers, as well as his own, extraordinary merits, from the Crown; might well be ſuppoſed (from ſo grateful and compaſſionate a Prince) would plead his Pardon, and free him from ſuch deſperation.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Becauſe of that intire Love and Friendſhip he bore to his moſt dear Friend the Lord <gap reason="illegible: page cropped" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> which both in Honour, and Conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> would forbid
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:44104:2"/>
and deter from ſuch an Action, which muſt ſo neceſſarlly tend to the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ruin and deſtruction of his beſt Friend, and which fell out accordingly from the ſiniſter conſtruction they made thereof.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Becauſe of the previous notice given thereof in divers places, which to be ſure he would never have done, had he deſigned any ſuch thing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From the Impoſſibilities that he could ſo do as the Inqueſt declares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it was impoſſible that he at one cut (as the Verdict ſaith) could cut 4 Inches in depth, and 8 in length, becauſe none can manage his hand, to guide a Razor ſo to do at once, <hi>viz.</hi> From the left-ſide of the Neck-bone, to the right.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe it is impoſſible that with that French Razor, which was but 4 Inches and a half long, and without a Tongue (neceſſitating to take 2 Inches and a half at leaſt in his Hand) that he could with 2 Inches of ſuch an Inſtrument cut 4 or 5 Inches in depth and 8 or 9 in length.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe it is impoſſible in Nature that when he had cut the left Jugu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and Wind-pipe to the Neck-bone (which let out ſo much of the Blood and Vitals) that he could have either life or ſtrength, to proceed to cut the other alſo, as all skilful Chyrurgeons and Anatomiſts can demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe it was utterly impoſſible, that after he had lockt himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Cloſet, he could ſo cut his Throat as it was, and then open the Cloſet Door, and fling the Bloody Razor out of the Chamber Window, at ſuch a diſtance from the Cloſet, and then get the Razor up again, and keep it in his hand (as ſome) or fling it by him (as others) and all this after he was Dead, for he inſtantly dyed ſaith the Inqueſt, and none but himſelf in the Room ſay their Witneſſes, therefore it was impoſſible he could with that Razor ſo Murther himſelf. And that the Bloody Razor was flung out of the Chamber Window, is made good by no leſs then 10 Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Thus have you ſome Grounds and Reaſons (from the improbability and impoſſibility of the thing) to clear his Innocency from the Horrid Fact, ſo impudently charged upon him, and conſequently the guilt of others, and which may be ſufficient to all wiſe Men, to detect the Murther, and inforce a review, if no other Evidence could be produced: ten fold leſs, has done it, in other Caſes, it being ſo difficult many times to get light, and trace ſuch Secret hidden works of darkneſs, as Sir <hi>Fran. Bacon</hi> elegantly in Sir <hi>Tho. O.</hi> caſe tells us, <hi>That wiſe men muſt take upon them in theſe Secret Caſet,</hi> Solomons Spirit, <hi>that when there could be no Witneſſes, Collected the Act by the Affection, viz.</hi> When he uſed the Stratagem about dividing the Child, but this you'l find is not our caſe, providence having given us a larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion as you will further hear.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly that he was Barbarcuſly Murthered by others appears.</hi> 1. <hi>By the</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:44104:3"/>
               <hi>undeniable Circumſtances ariſing</hi> 1. <hi>From the previous Reports.</hi> 2. <hi>From the corrupt and partial Proceedings of the Coroner and his Inqueſt.</hi> 3. <hi>From the Conſpirators Villanous ends. And</hi> 4. <hi>From the wicked Methods uſed to ſtifle it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By the undeniable Circumſtances ariſing,</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>From the many previous Reports which they had ſpread of his ſelf Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> (a Method the Papiſts have therefore taken (but the Policy thereof ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver underſtood.) <hi>viz.</hi> When the ſtobbed <hi>H.</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France,</hi> burnt <hi>London,</hi> aſſaſſinated Sir <hi>E. B. G.</hi> and murthered <hi>Hawly</hi> the Warder) of which, divers undeniable Proofs have been, and are ready to be produced, of ſuch Reports, not only in <hi>London,</hi> but 50. 60. 80. 90. 100. Miles off; in ſome places a day, in ſome two days, in others (at a great diſtance) the very Day he was murthered: And as moſt remarkable (as God would have it) all agreeing in the very manner thereof, <hi>viz.</hi> Cutting his Throat in the <hi>Tower,</hi> At <hi>Andover,</hi> 60. Miles off, they had the Report of his Cutting his Throat in the <hi>Tower</hi> the <hi>11th.</hi> of <hi>July.</hi> which was the firſt day of his Impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment there (for by reaſon of his late Commitment, the Night before he lay at the <hi>French</hi> Lord <hi>Feverſhams</hi> in <hi>White-hall)</hi> which ſufficiently diſcovers what they deſigned before hand, for if this Report came from <hi>London,</hi> it muſt be before he was a Priſoner, at leaſt in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and two days before the thing was done.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>From the irregular, corrupt, partial and unjuſt Proceedings of the Coronor and his Inqueſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That one <hi>Farnham,</hi> ſaid to be a Deputy Coroner, which the Law knows nothing of, and to be ſure a Legal Coroner he was not, Sir <hi>Thomas Stringer,</hi> the Steward of the <hi>Tower,</hi> being the proper Officer, and accountable for that great Truſt, but this is the Tool who muſt be brought forth to do the Job.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That none of the Relations were ſummoned to attend the Inqueſt, which by known Uſage ought to have been.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That contrary to the known Cuſtom and Uſage, not only of our own, but other Nations, as well as the Kings ſpecial and expreſs Command, the Body was removed from the Place and Poſture it was ſaid firſt to be found in, ſtript, and Cloaths taken away, and Body and Rooms waſht from the Blood, to prevent the Notoriety of the Fact upon the View, and as ſaid, by the new Coroners Contrivance or Conſent (which makes it the more hainous and ſuſpicious:) For had it remained in the Place and Poſture it was ſaid firſt to be found in, the print of the bloody Foot upon the Stockings, the Cravat or Neck-cloth being cut in four pieces in the middle, and the contrary Witneſſes, who ſpake both as to Place and Poſture, would have clearly diſcovered the Murther. The notched Razor, and cut Hand, being moſt pregnant Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, yet little regarded.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Jury excepted againſt the removing of the Body from the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:44104:3"/>
Poſture and Place, and demanded a View of the Cloaths, which <hi>William Fiſher</hi> did by Name, yet was denyed the ſame by the Coroner, after he had been in the next Room with ſome of the Conſpirators, who had call'd him out upon that Demand, and who upon his return to the Jury again did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare to them (as ignorantly as wickedly) that they were to ſit upon the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, not the Cloths</p>
            <p n="5">5. The partial examination of Witneſſes, that though there were ſeveral in and about the Houſe when the Fact was done, yet only <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> who they might juſtly ſuſpect to be privy to it, muſt be the principal Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes they'l examine in the Caſe, taking little notice of <hi>Peck, Munden, Loyd,</hi> Captain <hi>Hawly</hi> himſelf, or the two Women.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The little regard had to the notorious Contradictions in the Witneſſes, they did, or might examine, <hi>Bomeny</hi> telling them, the Razor was given him (wherewith he cut his Throat) the <hi>12th.</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel</hi> the <hi>13th. Bome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> that <hi>Ruſſel</hi> broke open the Door, but <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> that he eaſily opened it with the Key on the outſide; <hi>Bomeny,</hi> that he could only through the Chink of the Door, ſee ſome Blood, and ſome part of the Razor; but <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> that he could through the ſame Chink ſee the whole Body; <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> that the whole Body lay in the Cloſet, and none of it to be ſeen in the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but <hi>Peck</hi> and others, that part of it lay in the Chamber; <hi>Bomeny</hi> and <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> that they were abſent but a quarter of an hour from my Lord, but to others, <hi>Bomeny</hi> owns he was abſent from him two or three hours, inſomuch as he was cold and ſtiff before he ſaw him, ſome, that he was found lying, others kneeling.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That they unduly ſuffered themſelves to be hurried into a Verdict by the Meſſage brought them by Captain <hi>Hamly</hi> in the Kings Name to haſten the ſame, as though the Death of ſo great a Man, and in that place too, deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not a ſerious and due Search, eſpecially when they ſaw ſuch foul play offered them, by removing Body and Cloaths, and denying a View of the Cloaths, and when none of the Relations preſent, and ſo few of the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes examined, and thoſe in ſo much Contradiction too.</p>
            <p n="8">8. By the unheard of drawing up the Verdict, which was done, not by the Coroner, nor by the Jury amongſt themſelves, as it ought to have been, but by one of the Conſpirators themſelves in the next Room, who ſent it to them by <hi>Bomeny,</hi> and which they ſigned accordingly.</p>
            <p n="9">9. By giving ſo wicked and falſe a Verdict upon their Oaths, which was this, <hi>viz. That the Earl of</hi> Eſſex <hi>being the</hi> 13th. <hi>of</hi> July <hi>alone in his Chamber, did with a Razor voluntarily and Feloniouſly cut his Throat, giving unto himſelf one mortal Wound, cut from one Jugular to the other, and by the Aſpera Arteria, and the Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, to the Vertebres of the Neck, both the Jugulars being throughly divided, of which ſaid Wound the Earl inſtantly died.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was the Conſpirators Diabolical Writing, which they impoſed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44104:4"/>
upon the Jury, and they made their Verdict both Coroner and Inqueſt, by ſubſcribing it.</p>
            <p>It falſly ſaith, he was alone in the Chamber, whereas by the flinging out the bloody Razer, as well as by ſufficient Teſtimony it will appear, that ſeveral went up and came out at that time.</p>
            <p>It alſo falſly ſaith, he did give himſelf with that Razer one mortal Wound, of ſuch a length and ſuch a depth, which are utter impoſſibilities as before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>From the Villanous ends the Conſpirators had to effect and carry on hereby,</hi> viz.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To confirm a Proteſtant Plot, a thing which they had long and often laboured, and as often been diſappointed in, and which was ſo improved by the Atturney General, as 1000 Witneſſes to make it good, as alſo by the Lord Chief Juſtice as the Finger of God, to convince all the World thereof, the ſad conſequence whereof hath ſince been ſo ſeverely felt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Utterly to ſtifle the Popiſh Plot, witneſs the Bailing the Popiſh Lords, impeached and committed by Parliament, out of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and the publick Prints to redicule the ſame ever ſince.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To deſtroy the Lord <hi>Ruſſel,</hi> and therefore done at the very inſtant he was to come to his Tryal, and ſo improved by the Lawyers to the Jury, which ſome of them have owned, did more prevail with them to bring him in guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, than any other Proof produced againſt him.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That they might remove out of the way ſo great a Champion of the Proteſtant Cauſe and Intereſt, who by his great Imployments and Truſts in this and the other Nation, had gained ſo perfect knowledge of their Popiſh horrid Intreagues, the way they have taken of old, both in this and other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and whereof divers Inſtances might be given, beſides that of Sir <hi>E. B. Godfry,</hi> whoſe Wounds bleed a freſh at the mentioning hereof.</p>
            <p n="5">5. That hereby they might carry on a Helliſh Deſign againſt the King himſelf, as though he had been privy thereto, by not only butchering him in that his Royal Priſon and Palace (where by the Law he becomes Pledge for the Safety and forthcoming of the Priſoner) and at a time when he was there in Perſon, where he had not been for divers years before; and as though he came purpoſely to order the doing thereof, and to intitle the Government to it. Which the Lord Chief Juſtice doth ſo often inculcate: If he was indeed then murthered by others from the Kings preſence there [in <hi>Brad<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ns</hi> Tryal] as alſo by that their horrid Preſumption, in ſending in the Kings Name to haſten and hurry the Jury into that corrupt Verdict, and ſo daringly and contemptuouſly to remove the Body contrary to the Kings expreſs Command by a Perſon of Quality.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>From the Methods which have been uſed to ſtifle the Diſcovery hereof, and to deter Men from inquiring into the Matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. By the Lawyers and Judges, who have declared, that whoever went
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:44104:4"/>
about to prove the E. of <hi>E.</hi> murthered, did no other then libel the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and bring the Guilt of his Blood upon it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By the ſtrict Command given by the Officers of the Guards in the Tower the day after the murther, to all the Souldiers, not to ſpeak one word thereof at their Perils.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By the ſevere proſecutions, and perſecutions, of thoſe who have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared herein, both as to their Eſtates, Perſons, Lives, and Liberties.</p>
            <p>Witneſs, the turning out of old <hi>Edwards</hi> from his place in the <hi>Cuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,</hi> wherein he had been 39 years, for only bidding his Son upon his Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing ſpeak the truth in the Caſe; and the many ſeverities to Mr. <hi>Bradon</hi> for declaring what others had ſaid about it; and the ſevere dealing with Mr. <hi>Hugh Speak</hi> for the ſame; as alſo that late cruel uſage of that poor Souldier in the Tower, becauſe he would not affirm the E. of <hi>E.</hi> murthered himſelf; who was firſt whipped with Cords till the Skin was flay'd off. 2. After that Scourged with Rods. And 3. put upon the Wooden-horſe with 6 Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets at his Heels, Sword broken and caſher<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d. But eſpecially the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of <hi>Rob. Meak</hi> the Sentinal, for telling what he heard and ſaw that day of the bloody Tragedy; whoſe Neck was therefore broke, and flung into the <hi>Tower</hi> Ditch; who declared before hand to his Friends how his life was threatned for the ſame. As alſo <hi>Hawly</hi> the Warder who was ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in like manner for blabbing, whoſe murthered body was about a Month after it was miſſing, taken up near <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> where a great Popiſh Lord declared ſeveral days before he was found, that he had there drowned himſelf.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By the endeavours which have been uſed to prevent the Review which by 2 Letters to 2 Noble Men, and the Letter to the Lady <hi>E.</hi> ſent open by a Meſſenger to <hi>Cadman</hi> the Bookſeller, which he brought to Juſtice <hi>Henton,</hi> and he to the Secretary; all of them purporting a diſcovery up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Indemnity and a Review, but all in vain.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>By Poſitive proofs, atteſting the Murther, that if Indemnity may be granted as was offered in Sir,</hi> E. B. G. <hi>caſe; and a freſh Legal Enquiry, as in Sir</hi> Tho. O. <hi>Caſe, and others, there will then be produced poſitive Evidence, which will declare who were the contrivers and Authors, who the Actors and Abetters of this Barbarous deteſtable Murther, deſcribe the Inſtrument with which it was done, and which was made on purpoſe for the ſame: The rewards and preferments to the reſpective Actors therein, with all the material Circumſtances about it. Which enquiry, was ſuccesfully made in Sir</hi> Tho. O. <hi>caſe, after the</hi> Coroners <hi>Inqueſt had found it (as ſaid) a natural death. And by which after more then</hi> 2 <hi>years ſtifled by a high hand; The then Principal Miniſter of State, and his aſſociates with the Lieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant of the</hi> Tower <hi>and others were ſearcht into, found Guilty, and many of them Executed for that horrid Murther, committed upon that Innocent Gentleman in the</hi> Tower<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <head>The Concluſion.</head>
            <p>Now may not this diſmal Tragical account (which carries ſo much Demonſtration in it) be well left without a Comment, or any Rhetorical ſtrain of Wit, or flouriſh of Eloquence, either to convince or ſatisfie the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Truth hereof, or provoke him to the diſcharge of that duty incumbent upon him in his Place or Station (which ſo Barbarous and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Murther calls for at his hand) the better to deliver himſelf and the Nation from the crying Sin of Blood Guiltineſs: And which is therefore left to the conſideration and Conſcience of all that hear thereof in general. And to all the Miniſters of Juſtice and his fellow Peers in ſpecial, whoſe Oaths, Honours, and Intereſts, may Oblige them to their duties herein; And who in Reaſon ought to feel the bleeding ſmart of this Bloody Stob, not knowing which of their own turns may be next. And to his Relations and Kindred in particular, who are more then others call'd forth in a peculiar manner, to make a further and better Inquiſition after his Blood, then hath yet been made, eſpecially after this full Diſcovery is offered to them. As they would vindicate his Innocency, wipe of the ſtain of Fellony, Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Treaſon, from the Noble Family. Deliver themſelves from the reproach of being bribed by the forfeited Eſtate, to hold their Tongues, and ſuffer others to be ſo ſeverely handled as officious for appearing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, under their ſilence; And as they would free themſelves from the Guilt of his Blood, and anſwer the neglect to God and Man. Laſtly to all thoſe (of which there are many) who either as Acceſſories or Actors have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew'd their hands in this Innocent Blood, whether ſince they are ſecretly known it will not be their wiſeſt and beſt courſe (as ſome did in Sir <hi>Tho. O.</hi> caſe) to come forth and confeſs, and give Glory to God, as they may hope for Mercy here, or hereafter: And not to think to ſhelter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under Gold and Greatneſs; which will be a covering (in this caſe) too ſhort for the greateſt themſelves, becauſe God who is the avenger of Blood, and to whom vengeance belongs, will bring all to the Houſe top, and recompence them according to their deeds. There being no Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs nor ſhadow of Death, where the workers of Iniquity may hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Concluding with <hi>Numb.</hi> 35. 30, 31, 33. <hi>You ſhall take no Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for the Life of a Murtherer which is Guilty of Death. Whoſo Killeth any Perſon, the Murtherer ſhall be put to Death. So ſhall you not pollute the Land, for Blood it defileth the Land, and the Land cannot be cleanſed of the Blood that is ſhed therein: But by the Blood of him that ſhed it.</hi>
