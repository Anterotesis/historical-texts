            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And not reſpecting the ſafetie of her tender charge ſcal'd with her wings the top of a lofty trée, where while ſhe ſate, a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe contemner of worlds euer-changing chaunces, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her ſelfe with the ſweetneſſe of her owne ſong, a Snake ſlilie créeping into the fooliſh birds late forſaken neſt deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the ſillie yonglings not garded as before with the warie Mothers watchfull eie: They ſtraining their tender breſts, implor'd their wretched dammes vntimelie aid, who hearing the ſad exclaimes of her betraied brood, and being the ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eie-witneſſe of their miſerie, turnd her ioyfull tunes into paſſionate laments, moaning ſo ſweetly, that Nature vrged by fatall neceſſitie, ſeemed to excel Art: but complaints were bootleſſe: for the cruell deuourer had alreadie engulfed the innocent yonglings in his venemous maw, whoſe deaths ſhe celebrated with her mournfull cries, &amp; framed their fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſong in heauenly notes.

            <p>LEauing this comfortleſſe harbour of the deſpairing ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard, I wandred halfe diſmaied through the ſpatious

plains, couered with mulitudes of graſing flocks: at laſt I diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cried a little hill, whoſe ſhadie top was thick ſet with Myr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Trees: approaching, I perceiud a little valley vnderneath, and therein a pleaſant ſpring: and at the foote of the hill I beheld a faire Shepheardeſſe, ſitting and making a prettye Garland of odoriferous Floures, to crowne her Swaine which ſate ſomewhat belowe, and euer as he durſt, did caſt vp his eyes the admirers of her beautie, yet fearefully, as not aſſured of her fauour. Thus while the one was buſie with her hands, the other with his eyes: a yong Heyfer, whoſe neck was not yet tamed with the heauy yoake, did in the valley ſport her ſelfe now friſking, then leaping wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly, ſometimes tumbling her bodie in the graſſe, and wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing on the ground, ſuddenly leaping vppe, as if glutted with the fruition of <hi>Floraes</hi> benefits: thus ſtill ſhe played, yet neuer wearie with play. The faire Shepheardeſſe ſmild at this ſight, as partaker of like fréedome: the Swaine ſéemd to ſighe, as depriued of like libertie: ſhe renude her ſmiles, as triumphing in his thrall, yet crownde him with the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land which ſhe made, as loth he ſhould deſpaire, hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued ſo faire a token of her fauour.</p>
            <p>The Shepheard comforted with this vnexpected courteſie, did reſume his loſt courage, and began thus to deſcant on his fortune.</p>

lyke kindneſſe conuerted his moane into mirth, his care into comfort, his deſpaire into hope: whoſe heauenly muſe, ſweete ſecretarie of his diuine conceit, would haue expreſt the ſumme of loues happines in matchleſſe lines, and encreaſed the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of conceitfull Arcadians, whoſe wits ſharpned with loues pleaſures, imploying their pennes in dooing homage to loues Altar, and publiſhing their Nymphes praiſes with neuer-dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing blazons of their beauties worth.</p>

I wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred therefore, muſing more then earſt I did, on the effects of loue, not knowing howe to terme ſo ſtrange a paſſion, whoſe diuerſe ſucceſſe did cauſe ſeuerall motions in their hearts, which were enthrald by fancie, and captiuated by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, yet all ending in extreames. I thought then that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets had reaſon to inueſt him with the title of Deitie, whoſe powerfull ſhafts had not onely pierced the yéelding hearts of mortall men, but made a forcible entrance into the relenting thoughts of immortall gods: <hi>Iupiter</hi> himſelfe <hi>Hominum ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor atque deorum,</hi> felt the force of his aſpiring Nephewes fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall weapons, elſe would he not haue courted <hi>Leda</hi> in the ſhape of a Swanne, wafted <hi>Europa</hi> in forme of a Bull, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into <hi>Danaes</hi> lap like a goulden ſhowre, beſides his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prety ſleights, which the amorous God did oft practiſe to beguile his iealous Queene.</p>
            <p>Nor was <hi>Apollo</hi> ignorant of loues power, who being ouermatched by <hi>Cupid,</hi> to whome he durſt equall himſelfe, was forced to eaſe his ouerburthened heart, and vtter his paſſion, exclaming thus in an impatient humor.</p>

my pen, in relating that which I ſaw or ſéemd to ſée in my morning viſion. Paſſing along, and viewing many trees, whoſe gorgeous branches garniſhed with rurall pompe, and the pride of <hi>Syluanus,</hi> did ſomewhat darken the ground with a ſpatious ſhade: not farre from the reſt, I eſpied a Myrtle tree, and approching did read written neere vnto the top, thus:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Vnder this tree faire <hi>Phyllis</hi> did relent,</l>
               <l>And <hi>Tityrus</hi> receiud his firſt content.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And a little vnderneath that, thus:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Faire Queene of loue to whom this tree belongs,</l>
               <l>Next <hi>Phyllis,</hi> thou ſhalt grace the ſhepheards ſongs.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And vnderneath that againe, thus:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>
                  <hi>Apolloes</hi> laurel to this tree ſhall yeeld,</l>
               <l>For <hi>Phillis</hi> deems the Myrtle cheefe in Field.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>And on the other ſide of the tree thus:</p>
            <lg>
               <l>The ſillie Swaine whoſe loue breedes diſcontent,</l>
               <l>Thinks death a triſle, life a lothſome thing:</l>
               <l>Sad he lookes, ſad he lyes:</l>
               <l>But when his fortunes malice doth relent,</l>
               <l>Then of loues ſweetneſſe, he will ſweetly ſing:</l>
               <l>Thus he liues, thus he dyes:</l>
               <l>Then <hi>Tityrus</hi> whom Loue hath happie made,</l>
               <l>Will reſt thriſe happie in this myrtle ſhade,</l>
               <l>For though loue at firſt did grieue him,</l>
               <l>Yet did loue at laſt relieue him.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>The ſeate vnderneath the tree was worne with their oft ſitting on it: for it ſeemed to be much frequented by <hi>Phyllis</hi> and her beloued Swaine.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5642:11"/>Héere by I gathered, that all Arcadians were not vnhappie, but the moſt, fortunate in loue: what though <hi>Ouid</hi> cenſured thus:</p>
            <q>Faſtus ineſt pulchris?</q>
            <p>Tuſh, that is an imperfection incident to ſome fewe, not a fault common to all. <hi>Amaryllis</hi> was coy, <hi>Helen</hi> had a gad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding humour: yea but <hi>Penelope</hi> was chaſt, <hi>Laodamia</hi> loyall, <hi>Artemiſia</hi> louing, <hi>Lucretia</hi> chaſt: thus haue we many proofes to anſwere any inſtance of feminine imperfection: yet nothing which is mortall, can bee abſolutely perfect: <hi>Virgils</hi> ſaying is moſt true.</p>

               <hi>Euridice,</hi> which liuing could not bee accuſed of inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, was after death blemiſhed with vnkindneſſe, becauſe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the couenant of her returne from hell. ſhe fondly loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked backe. The ſiluer-tongued <hi>Thracian,</hi> whom <hi>Apollo</hi> had endued with a double gift of muſicke and poetrie, beeing moo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with this, hated and with hatefull diſgrace diſparadged the woorth of that ſcxe which before hee had honoured by his matchleſſe Art: but if I proceed in this vaine, I ſhall fall into a Labyrinth more intricate than the firſt.</p>
            <p>Scarſe had I left that place, when I heard a loud noyſe of Pipes: &amp; looking forward, I ſaw a great troupe of mourners, towardes whome I paced: and drawing néere, behelde God <hi>Pan</hi> formoſt of this aſſemblie, who ſounded a dolefull note on his Oat en pipe: Next him came <hi>Syluanus, Pomona, Faunus</hi> and all the rurall powers, whome the light-foote Satyres fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed piping all, though harſhly, yet heauilie. Next after theſe, the ſwift-pacing Wood-Nymphes came, whoſe golden lockes ſtaining the beautye of <hi>Titans</hi> beames, hoong looſe about their ſhoulders: theſe did ſtrewe flowers on the ground as they went, hauing their lappes full, and with their voyces agreeing in one ſound, made a ſorrowfull, yet ſweet conſort.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:5642:11"/>Next theſe, a coarſe couered with a faire hearſe curiouſlie embrothered, and ouer-ſpredde with choyce plenty of ſwee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt flowers was carried by foure ſhepheards: on it this ſhort Epitaph in red letters.</p>
            <lg>
               <l>Heere beauties wonder lately ſlaine doth lie,</l>
               <l>Whome angrie <hi>Cinthiaes</hi> wrath did doome to die.</l>
            </lg>
            <p>A great troupe of Shepheardes followed this breathleſſe coarſe, which made mee muſe the more, thinking that it was ſome rare creature, at whoſe perfections that angry Goddeſſe did repine, as fearing that the report of hir worth would bring her deity into contempt: yet deſtrous to bee throughly reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, I demaunded of him which was the laſt of the company, what this ſolemne pompe did ſignifie: he courteouſlie ſhaped me this anſwere. Stranger, (for ſo thou ſeemeſt) know, that theſe are the obite rites of faire <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> whome fewe could match in beautie, none in pride. She refuſing the loue and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice of the beſt deſeruing Shepheard that euer was bred in Arcadia, beſtowed her fauour on a clowniſh Swaine, his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour in all perfections: hee it was whome thou ſaweſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the hearſe clad in mournfull attire: but ſodainelie re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting her choice, ſhe did coldly entertaine him, thinking him to bee honoured enough, and her ſelfe too much abaſed by ſuch ſleight fauors which ſhe affoorded him yet ſuch, as they might haue prolonged the other ſhepheards life, which could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein the leaſt courteſie, though worthy of the moſt. But proud <hi>Amaryllis,</hi> déeming her ſelfe better than any mortal creature, durſt attempt compariſons with the immortal powers, mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching her ſelfe in the height of her owne conceit with matchles <hi>Diana,</hi> the ſoueraigne of theſe Groues: who though ſprong of heauenly race, yet deignes to bleſſe Arcadia with her ſacred preſence. The Goddes iealous of her honor aimed at her one of thoſe ſhafts, where with ſhe wounds the flying beaſts: and depriued the coy girle of life, which would haue bereaued her of renowne. Thus being ſlaine by diuine iuſtice, ſhe is hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in her death, and her bodie accompanied to the earth with
<pb facs="tcp:5642:12"/>
the ruſticall muſicke of the rurall Dimi-Gods, and the celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all notes of the louely Nrmphes, which tune their voyce in a funerall ſong, they purpoſe to conuey her body to the darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Oroue, where it is ſaid, the fore-lorne Shepheard by her deſdeigned leads a ſolitarie life: who if he yet liue, may ſee his wrongs reuenged, and the cauſe of his complaints, on whome before he durſt not looke, lying by his ſide a breathleſſe obiect, on whome he may now looke his fill. If he be dead, her bodie ſhall be interred where he ſpent his daies in ſorrowe: But the loſſe of <hi>Niobe,</hi> the metamorphoſis of wretched <hi>Arachne,</hi> or the death of <hi>Marſias</hi> might haue warned her to auoyde like pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
            <p>Thus haſt thou heard the cauſe of this ſolemnity brieflie vnfolded: but now ſtranger thou muſt pardon me, I can ſpend no longer time in theſe diſcourſes, but muſt haſt after my companie.
