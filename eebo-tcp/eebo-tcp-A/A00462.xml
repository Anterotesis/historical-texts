            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:15019:4"/>
with all humilitie and becomming reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
to take into consideration that graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
instruction, which his <hi>Maiestie,</hi> in his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations</hi>
vpon the 20. chapter of the <hi>Reuelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
raiseth and enforceth by occasion of the
<hi>Deuils</hi> loosing, by the rising of <hi>Antechrist,</hi>
namely, that <hi>Whereas the iustice of God, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect
of mans falling wilfully from the truth (as
Paul saith) iustly did send to the world the great
Abuser with efficacie of lies; as well to tyrran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize
spiritually ouer the conscience by heresie, as
corporally ouer their bodies, by the ciuill sword.
Therefore we must feare to fall from the truth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uealed,
and professed by vs, that we may be free
from the like punishment.</hi> For assuredly, though
I dare not say, that euerie falling away from
the truth, with what circumstances soeuer it
may be qualified, is a <hi>sinne</hi> against the <hi>Holy
Ghost;</hi> yet I thinke I shall not stray from the
iudgement of the most and best Diuines, if I
affirme that the <hi>sinne</hi> against the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi>
is neuer committed, but there must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
concurre a wilfull and obstinate deniall
of a knowen and inwardly confessed truth,
or <hi>A withholding and keeping of it backe in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousnesse.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which sinne of sinnes, because lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
experience teacheth euery man whose eies
are open, that it is stealing vpon vs: The
Lord in mercy hath not only frequently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:15019:4"/>
against it in his word, denouncing
iudgement without mercie, to all them who
shall dip hands or hearts in the guilt thereof:
But also by signes and wonders, by strange
and vncouth prodigies, hee giues warning
that he folds not his hands together like a
sluggard, loth to pull them out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some,
or like such a God as the wicked faine
(because they would faine haue it so;) seeth
not, neither vnderstandeth any thing. But
that his eyes behold all the wickednsse that
is done vpon all the earth; as if hee had no
more than one particular person to attend
vnto: and that hee is whetting his sword,
and making ready his quiuer full of arrowes
against impenitent sinners, and such as will
not feare his name.</p>
            <p>His aboundant mercies indeed will not
suffer his iustice to take vengeance of sinners,
before hee haue (according to his owne Law,
in case of <hi>Israels</hi> making warre against other
cities and nations) offered peace and recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation
vnto vs: But for all that, when he
seeth his loue despised, his long-suffering con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned,
and all his couenants trodden vnder
foot; Hee is at length accustomed to shew
himselfe the <hi>Lord of his promise;</hi> and that all
his former patience proceeded not (as it fals
out many times with men) from feare of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
or the greatnes of the delinquents;
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:15019:5"/>
but only and meerely from his immeasura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
loue, which hateth nothing that he hath
made, and is so loth to punish, that if all had
continued in their primitiue order and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
puritie, the verie Word had neuer beene
named, nor had the thing it selfe euer beene
created.</p>
            <p>I should not haue spoken so much, nor
with so much confidence vpon this occasion,
had I not knowen that the same <hi>God</hi> who
alwayes hath written the <hi>texts</hi> of these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions
with his owne hand, hath likewise
ordinarily giuen this <hi>Interpretation</hi> of them;
and withall that admonitions, whether in
<hi>season,</hi> or out of <hi>season,</hi> cannot hurt; It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a happy occasion, whatsoeuer by any
meanes draweth vs to amendment of life.
Let not <hi>Philosophie</hi> wrangle with me for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
her, when I am employed in the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice
of our common Mistresse, <hi>Diuinitie;</hi> I
willingly giue vnto her the knowledge of
immediate and second causes; but shee her
selfe hath taught me, to giue vnto God the
ordering and disposing of <hi>Nature,</hi> and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant
influence into the least effects, which
she produceth.</p>
            <p>It were an hard matter for me to say, that
<hi>Parelij</hi> (so the <hi>Gracians</hi> call an appearance of
many <hi>Sunnes</hi> together;) and <hi>Paraselenai</hi>
(which are when it seemes that many Moons
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:15019:5"/>
appeare at the same time) are caused by the
reflexion of the beames of those Planets, from
an equally condensed cloud interposed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene
them and vs; as <hi>Rainebowes</hi> are (by
the refraction of their beames) from an hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
waterish, or dewie cloud, vnequally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>densed
or thickned (which is the cause of the
varietie of colours) as is plaine by a three
square glasse, which representeth more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
or at least more liuely than are in the
Rainebow. Of which who so are desirous to
see more, may read <hi>Seneca</hi> largely discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
thereof, in the first booke of his Naturall
questions, the 11, 12, 13 chapters, and diuers
others.</p>
            <p>And was there none among the many
thousands of <hi>Israel,</hi> that could satisfie the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed
multitude, concerning the causes of
<hi>thunder</hi> and raine; but that they must fall to
such a deiection vpon the sight and hearing
of them, as is expressed, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 18, 19.
Certainly, the vnsafe curiositie of mankinde,
when it hath gained credit in some things,
scornes to acknowledge his ignorance in any
thing, as we see by them, who being beleeued,
or thought to speake probably in the disclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
of the causes of <hi>Snowes, Dewes,</hi> and
<hi>Raines,</hi> haue from thence assumed vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
to bee able to giue naturall reasons of
the <hi>Deluge,</hi> of raining of <hi>Bloud, Milke, Wheat,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:15019:6"/>
Stones, Woll, Iron,</hi> and such like, whereof ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
histories written by credible Authors doe
make mention. How much better and safer
is it for vs, though these things bee granted
possible by Nature; yet since it cannot bee
denied that they are not ordinary in Nature,
to take the aduantage of them for the preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of that wrath, which, whether it be prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosticated
by these <hi>ostents,</hi> or no, will surely
be reuealed from Heauen vpon vs, when the
measure of our iniquitie shall be filled.</p>
            <p>Were wee at that point with God, where
we should be; we needed <hi>not to be affraid at
the signes of Heauen;</hi> simply and positiuely
wee need not feare them; as though they
could hurt vs, without the impulsion of his
hand which made Heauen and earth; or as if,
though hee had commanded his <hi>Army Royall</hi>
of all <hi>creatures</hi> to march against vs, and the
Heauens themselues to fight against vs, as
against <hi>Sisera,</hi> yet it were not in his power,
vpon our <hi>repentance</hi> to sound the <hi>retreat,</hi> and
make them all retire, and againe to renew the
league <hi>betweene the stones in the street and vs.</hi>
But when wee see the signes the same, and
know our sinnes the same, God will, without
doubt, rather accept of an humble feare,
that trembles at the hand, that shakes the
rod, than of a presumptuous and vnreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
confidence, that he who <hi>punished the periury
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:15019:6"/>
of Troy,</hi> should loue the <hi>lies of Rome,</hi> (to vse
<hi>S. Augustines</hi> words) or to vse the phrase of
<hi>Scripture,</hi> that hee who punished <hi>Iudah</hi> for
three transgressions should winke at <hi>Israel</hi> for
the multitude of her rebellions.</p>
            <p>When there were three Sunnes seene at
<hi>Rome,</hi> which by little and little did all grow
into one bodie, It was answered by the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of <hi>Southsayers,</hi> that it portended the

(which then were only knowen) <hi>Asia, Africke,</hi>
and <hi>Europe</hi> into one Empire; <hi>Grande specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum</hi>
(saith mine Author) <hi>&amp; quod grandia

too late to <hi>confirme</hi> it vnto him and his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steritie,
as long as the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moone</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding, euen at that time, there
were some that on the other side did stiffely
maintaine, that these <hi>three Sunnes</hi> could not
presage any good vnto the <hi>Romane Empire;</hi>
but rather a diuision and distraction of that
Imperiall power, as indeed it proued true;
for the yeare following began the <hi>Triumvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi>
of <hi>Lepidus, Caesar,</hi> and <hi>Antonie,</hi> which
made way vnto <hi>Caesars</hi> Monarchy, the period
of the <hi>Romanes</hi> libertie, and the beginning of
the decay of their greatnesse. And certainly,
it hath not been often seene or obserued, that
such <hi>Prodigies</hi> haue beene fore-runners of any
good vnto the place where they were seene:
howsoeuer, vpon a turning of the hearts of
the people vnto God, without question, God
can turne the threatned plagues vpon the
heads of the <hi>Heathen,</hi> and such as haue not
knowen his name.</p>
            <p>The like apparition of three <hi>Sunnes</hi> and so
many <hi>Moones</hi> which happened in <hi>Italy</hi> in the
yeare of Grace 1164. was thought to presage
the great dissension of the Princes <hi>Electors</hi> in
chusing the Emperor, and the schisme which
lately followed in the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> And
what the three <hi>Sunnes</hi> which three yeeres af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
were seene in <hi>Poland</hi> might seeme to fore-shew,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:15019:7"/>
the Chronicles of that Countrey doe
sufficiently demonstrate.</p>
            <p>And to passe by many other; those three
<hi>Sunnes</hi> which were seene at <hi>Magdeburge</hi> vpon
the 21. of <hi>March</hi> 1551. about seuen of the
clocke in the morning, accompanied with se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
<hi>Rainebowes:</hi> and the three <hi>Moones</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
the night of the same day: the three
<hi>Sunnes</hi> appearing againe in the same place,
the 21. of <hi>Aprill</hi> following, accompanied only
with three Rainebowes, might probably bee
thought to fore-shew the straight siege,
which (by the command of <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth)
<hi>Maurice</hi> the Duke of <hi>Saxony<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and <hi>Albert</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisse
of <hi>Brandenburge</hi> laid against that Citie
by the space of fifteene moneths; whereby
the Citizens were driuen to great extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
though afterward they made their peace
vpon good conditions.</p>
            <p>What should I speake of the three <hi>Sunnes</hi>
appearing ouer <hi>Vinarium</hi> a little Citie in <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringia</hi>
the tenth of <hi>Februarie</hi> 1555. Or of the
like in <hi>France</hi> before the battell of <hi>S. Quintins?</hi>
Because according to the Spanish prouerbe,
<hi>Da lueng as vias, lueng as mentiras;</hi> From farre
countreyes, foule lies: I will come close to
our owne times, and our owne home; nay, as
our Sauiour sayd, <hi>Regnum Dei est intra vos,</hi>
The Kingdome of God is within you: So
will I say, <hi>It is not beyond the seas, that thou
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:15019:8"/>
shouldest say, who shall goe ouer the sea for vs,
and bring it to vs, and cause vs to heare it, that
we may doe it? But the thing is very neere vnto
thee, yea euen before thine eyes to see it:</hi> And
therefore the more inexcusable are they, that
either will not beleeue it, or reflect no more
vpon it, than if they beleeued it not: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer,
thus it was.</p>
            <p>Vpon Saturday the 22. of December last,
at <hi>Tregnie,</hi> a market-towne in <hi>Cornewall,</hi> well
knowen to <hi>Cornish</hi> men, in respect of his
neerenesse to <hi>Falmouth,</hi> about eleuen of the
clocke before noone, the <hi>Sunne</hi> being vnder a
cloud, it was obserued that from the bodie
of the Sunne there proceeded a more scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
and dispersed light than was wont, as if
the bodie of the Planet had beene greater
than it had formerly beene: But this being
attributed only to the brightnesse of some
cloud betweene him and vs, little notice was
taken thereof, till about a quarter of an
houre after, this diffused light seemed to <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>center,</hi>
as it were, and gather to three heads,
which in short space appeared to the view of
the beholders to be three Sunnes, of equall
lustre and brightnesse, and placed as neere as
could bee ghessed in a <hi>Triangle;</hi> all shining
cleere, and scattering their beames with so
great light, as that the eye of man could not
fasten vpon any one of them more than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:15019:8"/>
And yet which is remarkable, the
light of the day was not increased, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
than in a cleare Suune-shine day, at
such time of the yeere it is accustomed to
be; so that they who were in their houses
could not, by reason of any such symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,
take notice thereof.</p>
            <p>This strange and extraordinarie sight
made the people (who were assembled
there in great number that day, as being
market-day) to forsake the streets and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places, where any thing might inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
it selfe betweene it and them, and to
betake themselues into open places,
whence they might the better discerne it;
where they, with feare and amazement, did
a great while gaze vpon it, not being able
to discerne which was the naturall <hi>Sunne,</hi>
and which his aduentitious and Mimicke
<hi>reflections.</hi> They that were of better iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
ghessed them to be distant one from
the other about two degrees, or two and
one third.</p>
            <p>Nor were they only that were at <hi>Tregnie</hi>
partakers of this fearefull and preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
oftent; but as many as dwelt within
foure or fiue miles round about were, or
might haue beene eye-witnesses vnto it;
peraduenture, not in so plaine and conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:15019:9"/>
a manner, because the <hi>cloud</hi> was not
either of height or largenesse: but it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouched
by some Gentle-men of good
worth and qualitie, that being that day
foure miles from <hi>Tregnie</hi> into the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
about twelue of the clocke, they did
plainly see and discerne it.</p>
            <p>At the same time, and so long as these
three <hi>Sunnes</hi> appeared, there were seene in
the aire, iust opposite vnto them, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most
due <hi>North</hi> three <hi>Rainebowes,</hi> two of
which were the one within the other, but
the third, against the course of nature, had
his center in the <hi>Zenith</hi> of that place, and
was almost contiguous vnto the other
two, hauing his backe almost ioyned to
theirs. That <hi>Rainebowes</hi> should appeare,
we know it to be no wonder, and that so
many <hi>Rainebowes</hi> as <hi>Sunnes,</hi> wee beleeue it
possible; but that any <hi>Rainebow</hi> should
bee greater than a <hi>semi-circle,</hi> or haue his
center aboue our <hi>Horizon,</hi> is a thing
which elder times haue not beene so well
acquainted withall.</p>
            <p>These <hi>Sunnes</hi> and these <hi>Rainebowes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in the manner abouesayd, from a
quarter of an houre after eleuen, vntill
halfe an houre after twelue; at what time
the light of the Sunnes, beginning by little
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:15019:9"/>
and little to grow weake, the thicke cloud
got the victory ouer them, and tooke them
away from the eyes of the beholders; and
at the same time also the Rainebowes their
attendants vanished, and left the day a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
troubled, (but much more the mindes
of the people;) yet about one of the
clocke, or soone after, the Sunne brake out
againe in his wonted and accustomed man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and the rest of the day was cleere and
free from clouds.</p>
            <p>Since this strange apparition, namely
vpon the tenth of <hi>Ianuary</hi> last, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
in <hi>Deuonshire,</hi> yet not farre from the
other place, being on the edge of <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall,</hi>
another wonder, which did as much
affright the eares of men, as this did their
eyes: For in the afternoone of that day,
being the <hi>Thursday</hi> after <hi>Twelfth day,</hi> there
were heard in the aire, vnusuall cracks or
claps of thunder, resembling in all points,
the sound of many Drums together, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
beating Charges, sometimes Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats,
sometimes Marches, and all other
points of warre: which after it had conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
a good time, it seemed that the same
thunder did most liuely expresse many vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leyes
of <hi>Small-shot,</hi> and afterward the like
volleyes of <hi>Ordnance,</hi> with so great, and yet
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:15019:10"/>
so distinct noyse, that many of them who
dwelt neere the sea, went toward the shore
to see what it might meane, as verily sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
there had beene some great sea-fight
neere vpon that Coast. These seuerall
fearefull noyses were againe and againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
in the same order, till at length,
with an horrible and extraordinary cracke
of thunder, there fell in a ground of one
<hi>Robert Pierce,</hi> where there were diuers
worke-men planting apple-trees, (which
ground lay neere the house of one Master
<hi>George Chidley</hi>) a thunder-bolt, if I may so
call it, being a stone of three foot and an
halfe in length, of two foot and an halfe in
bredth, and one foot and an halfe in thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
the substance whereof was in hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
and colour not much vnlike a flint, as
appeares by many peeces thereof, which
are shewed vp and downe by many credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and honest Gentle-men, who with their
own hands brake them off from the maine
stone. After the fall of this stone, which
with the weight thereof was cleane buried
in the ground aboue a yard deepe, the
thunder ceased, and people began as much
to wonder at that which they now saw, as
they had lately done at that, which with so
much feare &amp; amazement they had heard.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:15019:10"/>
You haue now heard a simple, plaine, and
short narration, of some great and feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
wonders, what the causes of them
were, we all may peraduenture coniecture,
though none of vs can demonstratiuely
shew: What the effects of them shall be, I
scarse thinke any man can coniecture; sure
I am, no man can certainly tell; It is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
safe nor good for vs to be <hi>Poliman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi>
but in all patience and prepared reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,
to submit our selues to the will of
God, we may well determine it the dutie
of euerie Christian.</p>
            <p>I had here put an end of this short and
vnpollisht discourse; but that being in
hand with it, there was brought vnto me a
briefe (but excellent) and simple narration
of the massacres committed by <hi>Papists,</hi> vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the persons of more than 400. men, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
and children, of the <hi>Reformed Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi>
in the <hi>Valletelline</hi> (a place in the <hi>Grisons</hi>
Countrey among the <hi>Rhaetian Alps,</hi> of good
importance for many respects) both in <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rano,
Teglio, Sundrio,</hi> and <hi>Malenco,</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
other places of the Countrey neere
adioyning: the ninth, tenth, and eleuenth
of <hi>Iuly</hi> 1620. wherein, though I confesse
there be such examples of crueltie and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanitie,
as a <hi>Turke, Infidell, Iew,</hi> or any
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:15019:11"/>
other sauing a <hi>Papist,</hi> would blush and
tremble at; yet not conciding so aptly
with this purpose, I will for the present o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
them, and (which agreeth better with
this <hi>argument</hi>) only touch vpon such <hi>Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies,</hi>
as the Author of that Treatise, who
as an eye-witnesse reporteth what he saw
and felt,
<q>Et quorum pars magna fuit.</q>
affirmeth, to haue beene seene and heard
in those places, both before the <hi>Massacre</hi>
and after; and thus they are word for

they heard in the Church of <hi>S. Geruais,</hi> a

and disputing about some great and seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

a great light; whereupon the <hi>Sentinels,</hi>
lighting their candles, went to goe downe

was: But as they were going downe, their
light was blowne out, and they going

blowne out, with greater noyse and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
