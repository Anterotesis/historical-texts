            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO Mr. <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Sermon.</head>
            <p>IT was a Circumstance peculiar to the Deliverance of the Children of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> that not so much as a Dog moved his Tongue against them, and such a Circumstance perhaps as the Church is in no Age to expect the like. The King and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament have thought fit to set the Dissenters at Liberty, and to give them a Manumission from their more than Egyptian Taskmasters; in which every true Protestant rejoic'd, as hoping that it might be an effectual Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to unite Protestants among themselves at home, and that it would tend to confirm and strengthen the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Interest abroad. But a certain Party of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> have, notwithstanding the concurrence of the greatest and best of her Bishops in settling the said Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by a Law, been always uneasy and peevish since, and constantly bawling against Dissenters: and not content with a Badg of servitude still fix'd upon them, by which they are excluded not only from all Ecclesiastical Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Benefices, but from all places of power and trust in the Civil Government, nothing will satisfy them except they have liberty to bite and devour their dissenting Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:35602:4"/>
as in former Reigns. And it's very well known, not only what heavy Censures his Majesty has lain under by that Party, because of his Fatherly Protection granted to Christians of all Denominations, but what Obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they laid in the way of his Affairs, in Council, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, Army and Navy; nay, how uneasy the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> have made him in his very Houshold; so th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t it would seem highly necessary that a due Enquiry should be made by what secret Springs those Persons are acted, that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue thus to foment Divisions amongst us. It is worthy our observation that this spirit of Discord at home, seems to be invigorated and gather strength at the same time when the spirit of Persecution rages afresh against the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants abroad. It is not at all to be doubted, but as <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>in</hi> was stir'd up against his Brother <hi>Abel</hi> by that wicked one, that all his Successors in Persecution are still influenc'd by that same malignant Spirit, who hath been a Murderer from the beginning; but at the same time it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that Satan makes use of Men as his Instruments to sow division and discord. Nor is it unworthy our Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that as the Papists abroad, and our implacable Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony-mongers at home, have their Spirits fermented at one and the same time, it is also in a great measure for one and the same Cause, <hi>viz.</hi> because they cannot bring all Men to submit to their Ceremonies and Modes of Worship of human Institution: and in truth of the two, our English Formalists seem to be the least excusable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they own themselves not to be infallible; disown human Tradition as a Rule of Faith, and in all their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversies with the Papists, make use of the same Arguments against the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that we make use of against the Ceremonies and Discipline of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They are still the more blame-worthy, because formerly
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:35602:4"/>
they laid the charge upon the Government that these things which are the subject of discord, were still conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued amongst us; but now that we have a Prince, who hath solicited that his Subjects might be united, and those things that are the Cause of Contention remov'd, they are so far from complying with him in it, that they are ready to fly in his face upon that account. This, if we may believe Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> the present Bishop of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who cannot be suspected of partiality in the case, was far from being the temper of the Church of <hi>England</hi>-Bishops, at least the best of 'em, in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s days, that Learned and Moderate Bishop in his Letters, containing an Account of what seem'd most remarkable in <hi>Switzer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Italy,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 42. says,
<q>He saw the Originals of Letters writ by several of the English Bishops to <hi>Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linger</hi> at <hi>Zurich,</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, whereby it appears, that the antient habits were preserv'd rather in compliance with the Queen, than out of any liking they had to them. That Bishop <hi>Jewel</hi> that great Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the English Church, in a Letter <hi>Feb.</hi> 8. 1566, wishes that <hi>the Vestments, together with all the other Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants of Popery, might be thrown out of their Churches, and out of the Minds of the People,</hi> and laments the Queen's fixedness to them. In <hi>January</hi> that same year Bishop <hi>Sands</hi> wrote to the same purpose, <hi>Contenditur de Vestibus papisticis, utendis vel non utendis; dabit Deus his quoque finem. Horn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Winchester July</hi> 16. 1565. regrets the Act concerning Habits, and expresses some hopes that it might be repeal'd next Session of Parliament, if <hi>the Popish Party did not hinder it.</hi> In many Letters on that subject 'tis asserted, that both <hi>Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> and <hi>Ridly</hi> intended to procure an Act for abolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Habits. Bishop <hi>Grindal</hi> in a Letter of <hi>Aug.</hi> 27. 1566, writes that all the Bishops who had been beyond Sea, at their return dealt with the Queen to let the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:35602:5"/>
matter of the Habits fall; but she continued inflexible—and <hi>Cox</hi> Bishop of <hi>Ely,</hi> one of the most violent Men of the time, in one of his Letters bewails the aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion they found in the Parliament to reform those abuses.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Then by the Testimony of these Great Men, who may well be called the Fathers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it appears the things in controversy betwixt us, are <hi>Popish Remnants</hi>; and that the Popish Party did then hinder the Acts concerning them to be repeal'd. And it is very well known that these things have been continued ever since, and some Additions made to them by the Influence of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Party, who were rampant in the beginning of <hi>Charles</hi> the First's Reign, and had no little Interest at Court, and in obtaining the Act of Uniformity, after the Restoration of K. <hi>Charles</hi> II. This being uncontrovertibly true, we have reason to believe that the same Party in concert with the Jacobites, are still the Incendiaries, and make it their business to add Fuel to our Flames; but we have this Happiness, that they cannot now, as formerly, make Tools of the Court, and by his Majesty's prudent Conduct, the highest places in the Church are many of them fill'd with Persons of a more generous and Christian Temper, than to comply with such angry ill-natur'd Men, that would again sacrifice the peace of the Nation to their own peevish humours. It remains then that the Tools they now work upon are some of the inferiour Clergy, and such of the dignified ones as are perhaps discontented that they are not elevated to an higher Dignity; from them, or the professed Jacobites proceed those virulent Invectives, that have of late by a superfoetation of Malice been brought forth into the world against Dissenters: by the timing of the thing it would seem they have a design to render them odious and obnoxious to the ensuing Parliament; and if they can but prevail to have their Liberty taken off or restrain'd, then they know that the Nation must be una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35602:5"/>
thrown into new Convulsions, that a great part of the Subjects who have been so useful and well affected to the present Government, will be thereby deliver'd up into the hands of their and its implacable Enemies; that the Episcopal Party in <hi>Scotland</hi> who are avowed Enemies to his Majesty's Person and Government, will be thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courag'd to embroil that Kingdom afresh; that the People of the North of <hi>Ireland,</hi> to whom all <hi>Britain</hi> ows so much, will also come under the lash: and so by an universal Confusion at home, whilst the Protestants are ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully persecuted by their Allies abroad, the way will be pav'd for the return of the late King <hi>James.</hi> This appears plainly to be the natural Tendency of those ill-tim'd Divisions that are so industriously fomented amongst us. To this end are all those <hi>Alarms to the true Sons of the Church directed, and their imminent danger from the Presbyterians, their</hi> Imperium in Imperio, <hi>and the erecting of their Classes inculcated.</hi> What a dreadful noise for this end have some Persons made about a harmless Letter, directed <hi>from a Presbyterian Minister in</hi> Newbury <hi>to another, importing a design among the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant dissenting Ministers throout this Kingdom to advance the Interest of Religion, and Reformation of Manners?</hi> What ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious Reflections have there been made upon that Letter by men of different Kidneys? What frightful <hi>Ideas</hi> do some men endeavour to possess the minds of the Nation with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Presbyterians, in a late virulent Pamphlet, call'd <hi>An Apology for the English Presbyterians?</hi> What strange Insinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations and imbittered Reflections does that Libel contain against the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the Classical Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians? and who can doubt of the mischievous design of all this malicious Clamor, when they know that the Papists and Jacobites raise the Hue and Cry on the one hand, and <hi>L.</hi> and <hi>F.</hi> with Sir <hi>R. L.</hi> raise it on the other? what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant game would it afford to the French King and the late King <hi>James</hi> to see the Church of <hi>England</hi> set on by this
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35602:6"/>
means to hunt down the Presbyterians? they are indeed the noblest Quarry, but if the wild Boar get once into the Forest, can the other Parties hope to escape? Yes, why not, <hi>L.</hi> would once more be of the Cabinet Council at <hi>Whitchal,</hi> and the Cardinal Protector of those of his Order.</p>
            <p>But I shall leave that honest Triumvirate to go on with their Consult in <hi>High-Holborn,</hi> and heartily wish that none of 'em may ever have occasion to go any higher. I return again to our Church of <hi>England</hi> Friends, it being high time to give one of 'em a <hi>Rowland</hi> for his <hi>Oliver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It seems, if Youngsters be once advanc'd to Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships in Colledges, and honour'd to wear Scarfs as Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men's domestick Chaplains, and to this have added the Title of Master of Arts, that they may then take the liberty to preach what they please, and to reflect upon those who have the Liberty of their Worship allowed them by Law as well as themselves; whether that be answerable to that deference to Magistrates, which Mr. <hi>Oliver</hi> preaches up so much in his Sermon, to throw such squint Reflections upon our Legislators, and to upbraid one of the greatest Magistrates of the Nation to his face for doing that which is allow'd both by the Laws of God and the Land, let him look to it. If his Heat had not been greater than his Judgment, he ought to have consider'd that one of the chief Arguments for Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies was, <hi>that being indifferent in themselves, yet when commanded by the Magistrate, they ought to be complied with</hi>; this he will find to have been the opinion of those great Bishops formerly mentioned in Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, as will appear by the Letters before quoted, Mr. <hi>Powel de adia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoris, Tilen's Parenaesis, Paybody's Apology,</hi> &amp;c. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seeing the Magistrate hath taken off those Laws that enjoin'd the practise of those indifferent Ceremonies, according to that Argument no man is now oblig'd to comply with them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:35602:6"/>Therefore as Mr. <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Reflections savour nothing of that Universal Charity he tells us our Blessed Redeemer came into the World to Teach; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Another thing he hath omitted in his Definition, is, that to VVorship God in Spirit, must necessarily infer the worshipping of him according to the Direction of his own Spirit in the Sacred Scriptures, without which, all those Impressions of his Majesty, Power, Rule, and Wisdom that he talks of, signifie nothing.

It's well he does but take it, but I think it's plain from what has been already said, he mistakes it; for all this while
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35602:9"/>
it's evident that <hi>Cato</hi> in his Distich before-named, had as true a Notion of Spiritual Worship as Mr. <hi>Oliver:</hi> And therefore I will make bold to tell him, that if he don't make haste to increase more in Spiritual Knowledge than hitherto he has done, it will be a great while before he deserve to be made a Spiritual Lord; but I am afraid he has already spoil'd his Lawn Sleeves during this Reign, whatever hopes he may have in another.</p>
            <p>I would fain know whether by part of his own defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Spiritual Worship, he hath not excluded himself from the number of Spiritual Worshippers, by failing in his <hi>Obedience to Authority,</hi> and in his Respect to those <hi>whom God has set over us,</hi> in railing thus against those whose Worship is establish'd by Law as well as his own: Does he think, that when the King and Parliament pass'd the Act for Liberty, they design'd that every little Prag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Priest should revile Magistrates to their faces, and reflect upon the whole Dissenting Party in such a manner as he has done, for non compliance to Humane Ceremonies in Divine Worship? If it were so, then the Nonconformists are only ty'd down to a Stake, to be baited by <hi>every dumb Dog, that cannot bark, except it be for gain from his Quarter:</hi> Such kind of <hi>Dogs</hi> as these the Apostle enjoyns us to beware of, as well as <hi>of the Conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion</hi> by which they made a Schism in the Church, and would have forc'd Circumcision and other Jewish Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies into the Christian VVorship, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.2. Just so our Author seems to be one of those that would tear the Flock, and return again to the old Vomit of Persecution; he and his Brother the Author of the <hi>Mystery of Phana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism,</hi> would make a delicate couple to be under the Conduct of some of Antichrist's Huntsmen, for they seem both of 'em to be deep-mouth'd, and so well vers'd in the Art already, that they understand all the Hunters Notes, from <hi>Tone,</hi> to <hi>Tontontontontavon.</hi>

               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:35602:10"/>We come next to hear him open upon full scent, for <hi>Page</hi> 11 and 12. with a Medley of a Charge he falls foul upon some of the Dissenters; saying, <hi>They are above Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances and all manner of Rule, guided by Fancy and a Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Zeal.</hi> I am afraid he has in those very words describ'd himself and the rest of his Kidney, who will force their own Impositions into the most Solemn Ordinances of the Gospel, and exclude those from the Church that won't comply with them; for if this be not to set themselves above all manner of Ordinances and Rule, when the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture expresly forbids any adding or diminishing to its self, as the Rule of our Faith and Manners, I cannot tell what is. However, I know that by this he means the Quakers and some others; but then in common Ingenuity he ought to have made a distinction, and not have added all Dissenters together, to inflame the Reckoning; and in the mean time let me tell him, that such as he set them a very bad Example, in going so far astray from the Rule, and making things they own to be indifferent, necessary terms of Communion.</p>
            <p>He falls next upon those <hi>that make use of his Text against all manner of Ceremonies</hi>: But who these are, I know not, nor never heard of, nor I believe no body else; had he said, significant Ceremonies, or a kind of <hi>Party-per-pale Sacraments, that must be outward and visible Signs of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and Spiritual Graces, such as the Sign of the <g ref="char:cross">✚</g>, is made to be our fighting under Christ's Banner, &amp;c.</hi> he had said somewhat; and then I should have made bold to tell him, tho' I incur the danger of an <hi>ipso facto</hi> Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication for it by the Canons of his Church, that such Ceremonies are <hi>ipso facto</hi> condemn'd by this Text, that teaches us we must worship God according to Truth, which is his Revealed will, and if he can find any thing there en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning those Ceremonies, I will yield him the Cause, and for his further Comfort, I will also tell him, that what <hi>the Scripture doth not Command in matters of Worship,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35602:10"/>
it forbids, and without the Law, and against the Law, as in Policy, so in Divinity, are both one according to</hi> Tertullian, <hi>in his</hi> Corona Militis; and I am of the mind he made a greater Figure in the Church than ever our Author will do so long as his Name is <hi>Oliver.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So little does this Zealous Ceremony-monger under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Controversie in which he is so fierce a Disputant, that he tells us, <hi>we our selves make use of Ceremonies</hi>; and what are they? Why, truly they are <hi>set Looks, a formal Voice, and forc'd Gestures</hi>; a wonderful Discovery! wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the <hi>Genius</hi> of that Noble Author, call'd, <hi>The Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Phanaticism</hi>: But does not this little <hi>Sprig,</hi> or <hi>Sucker</hi> of <hi>Divinity,</hi> know that these Things, if they must be Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, are not impos'd upon those of our Party as Terms of Communion? For our parts we are so little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd about such things, that we should not value it one rush if all the Youngsters of the Church wore their Shooes upon their Head, and their square Caps upon their Feet, as well as their Shirts on the outside of all their other Cloaths, if they would not thrust them down our Throats as Terms of Communion, and tell us we shall neither have the Priviledges of Men nor Christians, if we don't let them do so.</p>
            <p>But now he comes with the killing Stroke, that it's al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most time for the Huntsman to sound the Death of the Hart, with a <hi>Tone Tontontaven,</hi> &amp;c.
He tells us, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. and 15.

work'd up, by Heat and Passion, to say <hi>Amen</hi> to no better than Nonsense, sometimes, I fear, even Blasphemy it self—Strange is it, that Men otherwise sober, and that will not venture a Sermon, which they will not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress to the People, without Care and Accuracy of Word<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, should yet dare to entertain Commerce with God at all Adventures, buoy'd up with a little popular Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause and Self-Conceit! Most evident it is, that what they would make the World believe is immediately from Heav'n, is attainable by Memory, and a Volubility of Speech, and perfected by a great share of Confidence.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here, as elsewhere, this Novice hath entertain'd the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditory with Ignorance, Railing, and Falshoods. I could wish that his Tutor, when he returns to <hi>Cambridge</hi> again, would whip him a little for <hi>Ignoratio Elenchi.</hi> Is it not a horrid shame, that a Confident Prig should step up to the Pulpit of the Greatest Cathedral in <hi>England,</hi> pretending to preach upon Controversies, and not so much as under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the State of the Question he pretends to handle? Then let him know, that the Nonconformists don't deny the Lawfulness of set Forms, provided they be sound, and only made use of by those that can't do without them; for they are always so good natur'd, as to allow the Lame a Crutch: But the thing they deny, is this, <hi>that it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful for any Church or Society of Men upon Earth, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose stated Forms of other Mens composing to be used by Ministers in the whole Exercise of their Ministerial Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and no others</hi>: This being a Yoke that many of the Conformists themselves don't submit their Necks to, but use Forms of their own composing, or extemporary Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, many times before Sermon, at visiting the Sick, and otherwise. If our Author will read <hi>Didoclavius</hi> his <hi>Altare Damascenum,</hi> an ancient and learned Author, or Dr. <hi>Collins</hi> of <hi>Norwich,</hi> a Modern Author upon the Subject, he will find this to be, and to have been the Principle of the Non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conformists
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35602:11"/>
upon that Head; and the reason of it is this, that the Gift of Prayer, as well as of Preaching, is given by our Saviour to his Ambassadors, else how should they be the Mouth of the People to him, as well as the Deliverers of his Message to them? The stinting of Ministers to the Forms of others, is perfectly to make them guilty of the neglect of part of that Gift, which they receive at their Ordination by the hands of the Presbytery, against which the Apostle cautions <hi>Timothy,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is likewise plain by <hi>Acts</hi> 6.4. that it is the Duty of Ministers to give themselves to Prayer, as well as to Preaching; and seeing many of the Preachers, by giving themselves to it, (nay, most of those in other Countries) attain to a Faculty of delivering the Message of God in good Method and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage without Notes; for what Reason can our Author think it impracticable for them, if they likewise give them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to Prayer, to deliver their own, and their Peoples Desires, in the same manner to God without the help of a Form? I confess for such as he, who seems to be grosly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of the Office and Duty of a Minister, and is more like <hi>Jeroboam</hi>'s Priests of old, that by consecrating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with a Bullock and ten Rams, were fit to be Priests to them that were no Gods, a Form of Prayer may be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary; for by his ignorant Twattle, he seems to be such a Parson as the Story goes of, who could not tell what Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to read for a poor Man, that came to him when his House was on Fire; but at last bethought himself of that for Rain, which he wisely conceiv'd would extinguish the Flames: But when he came to mumble it over, it was only for moderate Showers; which the poor Man knowing not to be enough for his Necessity, made bold to mend the Form, and cried out for whole Buckets full.</p>
            <p>For his ignorant and irreligious Questions, <hi>Where the Assistance of the Spirit is promised, or upon what account in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed necessary,</hi> they smell so rank of the Libertine, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35602:12"/>
we may justly enter our Exceptions against his Evidence in matters of Religion, as an utter Enemy to it: But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him if possible, let him read his own Text once more, which is a Promise as well as a Prophecy, that the Spirit should assist the Saints under the Gospel in their Worship, of which Prayer is a very great part. Let him read <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.26, 27. and there he will find <hi>the assistance of the Spirit to be necessary to help our Infirmities; for we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit it self maketh Intercession for us with Groanings which cannot be uttered; and he that searcheth the Hearts, knoweth what is the Mind of the Spirit, because he maketh Intercession for the Saints, according to the Will of God.</hi> He may likewise read the Fifteenth Verse of that same Chapter, and there he will find that true Christians <hi>receive the Spirit of Adoption, by which they cry Abba Father,</hi> and are as naturally enabled thereby to pour out their Souls before God in Prayer for Spiritual Mercies, as we are by Nature prompted to request such things of our Earthly Parents as we stand in need of, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Set Form. Let him read <hi>John</hi> 14.26. and there he will find a Promise, <hi>That the Comforter, the holy Spirit, shall teach us all things</hi>; and if Prayer be a Christian Duty, it must certainly be included in the Bosom of this Promise. If he thinks to evade this by pretending that we alledg the very words of our Prayers are inspir'd, Let him quote any Dissenting Author, <hi>Quakers,</hi> or some such excepted, that have said so if he can.</p>
            <p>I conceive his profane Raillery, that we entertain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with God at all Adventures, is sufficiently censured already, when I have made it appear that we have the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Spirit to help our Infirmities: But I shall tell him further, that if ever he come to have any Experience of the Work of God upon his own Soul, to see the Sinfulness of his Nature, and that he is eternally undone without a Saviour, it will be no longer such a Mystery to him; and I
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:35602:12"/>
would fain know his reason why a Minister that is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the Condition of his People, as all of 'em ought to be, and is able to instruct them in their Duty, and to reprove them for their Sins without a Set Form, may not as well, and as easily represent their Desires to God in the same manner, pray for his Assistance against their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Temptations and Sins, beg for those Graces they want, offer up Praises for such Mercies as they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and turn his Instructions to them, into Petitions for them, without hazard of Blasphemy or Nonsence.</p>
            <p>Let him give us his reason why all Ministers and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians, must be tied up to the Forms of others, who have no more right to those Promises abovementioned than themselves, and as appears by the Event, have had a lesser share of them, than many others have had.</p>
            <p>Our Author before he had made so many ill grounded Objections and Charges against Extemporary Prayer, ought first to have taken the Beam out of the Eye of his own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, before he had offer'd to pull the Mote out of those of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. He cannot but know, or have heard, that the Book of Common Prayer is objected against, as being the Mass-Book, Romish Breviary, and Rituals, translated with some A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments, as K. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6<hi>th.</hi> own'd in his Proclamation to the <hi>Devonshire</hi> Rebels, that it is chargeable with vain Repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that it stints God to such a daily Measure of Prayers, hinders many necessary Petitions, and the enlarging on those that it has, according to the necessity of the Persons that join in it, and many other things that I shall not now touch upon.</p>
            <p>It ill became our Author to charge Dissenters with Blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy in their Prayers at random, meerly upon report or slander, when his Party oblige all their Clergy to assent and consent to all the Mis-translations of the <hi>Psalms,</hi> and other places of Scripture in their Common-Prayer-Book, when its evident that sometimes a whole Verse or more is left out;

<q>He goes on with his usual Assurance, and says, Our Saviour prov'd by a Form, that the World has been so sensible of the Necessity of one, that there is no Age or Church that has left themselves at liberty.</q>
Not one word of which he can prove. Our Saviour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath giv'n us that usually call'd the Lord's Prayer as a Rule, and which we own we may lawfully use as a Form, but not to exclude others of our own composure. The idle Pretence that our Saviour compos'd this out of the <hi>Jewish</hi> Form<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> then in Use, hath been long since exploded; or if it were so, is a strong presumption that 'twas only to be us'd as a Form during the <hi>Jewish</hi> Oeconomy: But it is so evident in the Scripture, that our Blessed Redeemer and his Apostles tied themselves to no certain Form of Prayers, that none who have ever read the Bible can be ignorant of it. Is it not strange, if they judg'd a set Form necessary, that they should not have compos'd one themselves, or have told us who they empower'd to do it? And is it not a reflection upon the Scriptures, that they which are able to make the Man of God wise unto Salvation, should not be thought sufficient to direct us how to pray without set Forms, as well as it is to make Men able Ministers of the New Testament without set Homilies? Would not Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind look upon it as an Imposition on humane Nature, if Forms should be impos'd upon them, in which, and no other, they should be obliged to sue for Relief to their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35602:13"/>
in all the Calamities that may befal them, when it is impossible to compose such as will answer all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances? And is it not equally, nay, more absurd to restrain Men to Forms compos'd by others, for addressing the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty in their various Exigencies, that none can know so well as themselves; and which tho' not expressed in such Terms as may please such envious Criticks as our Author, yet He that searcheth the Hearts, knows the Mind of the Spirit, as we have heard before.</p>
            <p>As to his Assertion, that no Age hath been without a Form, 'tis <hi>Gratis dictum,</hi> he has it only by Tradition, and that he says himself is but little to be credited; I think the known Passages of <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in their Apologys, are more than enough to answer such a pert Youngster. The Passages are to the following Import: <hi>Tertullian</hi> speaking of the Worship of the Christians, <hi>Illuc,</hi> (that is towards Heaven,) <hi>suspicientes Christiani manibus expansis quia Innocuis capite Nudo, quia non erubescimus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni<expan>

               </gap>. If this pert So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phister knows any thing, he knows that those pretended Liturgies of <hi>Peter, James, Matthew, Andrew,</hi> &amp;c. are spu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and therefore shall say no more on the Subject, but this, that <hi>Eusebius</hi> in his Epistles of the Churches of <hi>Smyrna, Vienna,</hi> and <hi>Lyons,</hi> is silent as to any Liturgy. The like si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence there is in the Epistles of <hi>Clemens, Ignatius,</hi> and the Writings of <hi>Justin Martyr, Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Origen.</hi> Nay, <hi>Baronius ad An.</hi> 58. <hi>Numb.</hi> 102. treating expresly of the Publick Prayers of the Church, keeps the same silence as to the use of Forms. Mr. <hi>Oliver</hi>'s other silly Reflections of want of due Reverence in Places of Worship, are so like him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, that they deserve no other Answer but Contempt: If others keep on their Hats there, let him make amends for it, if he pleases, by pulling off his Shoes; and while others sit, may

he be condemned always to stand; and while others take no notice of the Altar, may he bow to it till his Breeches burst behind: For my own part, I know no reason for being cover'd, or uncover'd at any Sermon, but as Convenience directs; for though the Text be divine, the Commentary is humane; and I thin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> his own Sermon is a convincing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, that every thing delivered to us from the Pulpit is not the Message of God: We must bring them to the Touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, as the <hi>Bereans</hi> did, to try whether they be so, or not, and I am certain his will never abide that Test.</p>
            <p>I shall conclude this extemporary Answer to a premedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Sermon against extemporary Prayer, with this one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, that the late Lord Mayor may well be abused in the street by Ballad-singers, Hawkers, and raskally Fellows, when he was first abus'd to his face in the Pulpit by a pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Parson. A Noble Example, and as bravely followed! but if the City of <hi>London</hi> suffer their Chief Magistrate, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>reatest of the Kind in the whole Nation, to be thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus'd for going to Meetings, which was neither contrary to the Laws of God nor Man, they don't acquit themselves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Character: It is utterly intolerable, that a Gentleman, who his very Enemies must own, has acted the part of a good Magistrate, should be so scandalously abus'd. If this be Mr. <hi>Oliver</hi>'s deference to Dignities, it's pity he should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver preach in any other Place but <hi>Bedlam,</hi> where his name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Porter us'd to rave. And thus I leave the Huntsmen, who sounded the seven strokes to the Field, to sound the stroke of nine to draw home the Company; for I believe their . . . . . will scarcely recover his Game, so that he may ev'n sit down contented with the Honour of being the Ring-leader of those who sing such goodly Ballads, as <hi>they were gathering Grigs about the streets one day,</hi> and cry Lampoons against Magistrates another.</p>
