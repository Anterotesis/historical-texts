            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>LEt thy Heart be fixed upon the Lord, and the Arm of his almighty ſtrength, in the ſupporting thee, and teaching thee: for it is Chriſt that openeth the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding to underſtand the Scriptures; and the great Myſtery of Salvation lieth trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured up in Chriſt. And if thou without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, in the cool of the day, doſt ſearch and commune with thy own Heart, and be ſtill, thou mayſt find the true Bread that came down from Heaven, that whoſoever eateth thereof, ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dye: and thou ſhalt plainly ſee all Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers unmasked, and their Deceipt plainly and nakedly laid open, with all Antichriſtian Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb facs="tcp:172640:3"/>
uſed to this day; and their Myſtery of Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity unfolded unto all thoſe that are not wilfully blind, and deſire to ſtupifie their ſences.</p>
            <p>But if thou wilt ſearch in thy heart, in meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for the Light Chriſt, thou ſhalt finde Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalve, the Balm of <hi>Gilead,</hi> the Blood of Chriſt that will cleanſe thee from all ſin: for it will, by thy Obedience, bring thee to <hi>Mount Sion, the City of the living God, the Mount that cannot be touched:</hi> for it is a ſpiritual Life that muſt be witneſſed: And Chriſt plainly ſheweth, that <hi>the Father ſeeketh ſuch to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him, as worſhip him in the Spirit and in Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore <hi>lend</hi> thy Heart, nay, <hi>give</hi> it up into God, that thou, in thy own Veſſel, mayeſt have the Bread of Life: for it muſt be the Oyl in a Mans own Lamp, that muſt convey him into the Bridegrooms Chamber, to receive that Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: <hi>Come you bleſſed of my Father,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>inherit the Kingdom prepared for you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Enter, thou good Servant, into the joy of thy Lord:</hi> He is that great Prophet that <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake of, that whoſoever would not

hear, ſhould <hi>be cut off from amongſt the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;</hi> who is <hi>JESUS, that ſaveth his people from their ſins:</hi> Whoſe great day of power hath appeared unto many, and is appearing unto all, and doth pull down their pride: for, <hi>The loftineſs of men muſt be brought low, and their haughtineſs muſt be humbled:</hi> for Chriſt teacheth all His to be <hi>meek and lowly, that they may finde Reſt unto their Souls:</hi> for, <hi>Bleſſed are the meek; they ſhall inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the earth:</hi> And by hiding the Word Chriſt in thy heart, thou ſhalt be kept, as <hi>David</hi> was, from ſinning againſt God: for thoſe that hear the Voyce of Chriſt, &amp; deſire to be taught by Him, as the truth is in Jeſus, they ſhall be guided by him to do the will of God in every thing, and be led by the Spirit of God, to do as they would be done unto; and to walk in all things as Chriſt hath walked: for they ſhall be filled with the Spirit of Righteouſneſs, that filleth all in all: and they ſhall not need that any man ſhall teach them, but as the Anointing which dwelleth in them, teacheth them all things: for they ſhall know their true Teacher. <hi>Know you not that Chriſt is in you, except you be Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates?</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:172640:4"/>
And ſo being taught by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> they ſhall taſte of his fulneſs, and the Arm of his ſtrength they ſhall all witneſs; that will make them walk from ſtrength to ſtrength, and Grace ſhall make them ſee God in <hi>Sion: for Holineſs becometh the Houſe of the Lord for ever:</hi> And by leading holy Lives, they find their works to be wrought in God, and themſelves Branches ſpringing from that Vine Chriſt; and they come in by that true Door, and they follow <hi>Chriſts</hi> Voice: for he is their Shepherd, and he leadeth them into pleaſant Paſtures, where their Souls are refreſhed with that which is ſweeter then <hi>the Honey, and the Honey-Comb,</hi> and is better then thouſands of Gold and Silver: for it is the enjoyment of the Lord, which is better then Life.</p>
            <p>And therefore as thou tendereſt thy ſalvation, be like the wiſe man that fore-ſaw the evil, and made his hiding place in his God: for aſſure your ſelvs, High and Low, Rich and Poor, Learned and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlearned, Prieſts and People, the great day of the Lords Wrath is near at Hand, wherein the ſtout Ones of the earth ſhall tremble:

            <p>This Treatiſe is for your inſtruction, to bring you to a ſight of all that is paſt, and preſent, and to come.

               <hi>Though we have know Chriſt after the fleſh,</hi> (in one ſingle body) <hi>yet now henceforth know we him no more ſo,</hi> but we look after that <hi>myſtery which hath been kept ſecret from ages and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations</hi> paſt, which is <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of glory:</hi> &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt tell you that yet live in dipping in water, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Goſpel-Ordinances as ye call them, forms and types, you live yet under the miniſtration of Jeſus Chriſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the fleſh, declaring the Lamb Chriſt to remain as yet in one ſingle perſon: but know you, that as the miniſtration of <hi>Moſes</hi> gave way to this; ſo this miniſtration is to give way to the inward teachings of Chriſt, and the ſpreading of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:172640:10"/>
the Spirit in ſons and daughters, which will more excellently declare the glory of the myſtery. The man Chriſt Jeſus told the woman of <hi>Samaria, Woman, the time is coming and now is, that neither in Jeruſalem nor in this mountain ſhall men worſhip the Father; but they that worſhip him, ſhall worſhip him in ſpirit &amp; in truth, for the Father ſeeks ſuch to worſhip him:</hi> by theſe words as alſo, <hi>Luk. 17. 21. Joh.</hi> 4. 45. the ſon of man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that both outward forms, cuſtoms, and types of <hi>Moſes</hi> worſhip under that miniſtration at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> likewiſe all forms, and cuſtoms, and types of this miniſtration of himſelf, as the Lamb held forth at a diſtance to be our Mediator, ſhould all ceaſe, and give way to the ſpiritual worſhip of the Father in the latter days, or to the ſpreading of the Divine power in men; the one Law of righteouſneſs being the Teacher of all: ſo that upon the riſing up of Chriſt in ſons and daughters, which is his ſecond coming, the miniſtration of Chriſt in one ſingle perſon is to be ſilent and draw back, and ſet the ſpreading power of righteouſneſs and wiſdom in the chair, <hi>of whoſe kingdom there ſhall be no end:</hi> ſo as all things were gone out from the Spirit, and were gone aſtray, and corrupted: the Spirit in this great myſtery of truth being manifeſted in the fleſh, burns up that droſs out of the Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and draws in all things again back into himſelf, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares himſelf to be the alone wiſdom and power of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, that rules, dwells, that governs and preſerves both in and over the whole Creation, 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 19. 1 Cor.</hi> 5. 24. and now the Son delivers up the Kingdom to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and he that is the ſpreading power, not one ſingle perſon, become all in all in every perſon, that is the one King of righteouſneſs in every one.</p>
            <p>Here is plainly ſeen what the <hi>dividing of time</hi> is, which is the laſt period in which the Beaſt is to reign: for now every miniſtration pleads his priviledge till the Law of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs drown up all in himſelf. <hi>Moſes</hi> yet pleads priviledge in the practice of the Jewes after the fleſh: the Son of man, Chriſt in one ſingle perſon, pleads a priviledg; and not onely the true miniſtration of the Son of man according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles declaration, but likewiſe many falſe forms, cuſtoms
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:172640:11"/>
and obſervations of worſhipping are raiſed up through a wrong underſtanding of thoſe Scriptures; all pleads their priviledge: and laſtly, the miniſtration of the Spirit, forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all forms and types, worſhipping the Father in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of truth, this now pleads his priviledge as his due right by courſe. So that you ſee here is the <hi>dividing of time.</hi> But this laſt miniſtration is the ſufferer for the preſent, as being denied his right by the former, that ought to give way: and as the worſhippers in <hi>Moſes</hi> miniſtration envied and killed thoſe as worſhipped the Son of man, the Lamb and his worſhippers; ſo now thoſe that worſhip Chriſt at a diſtance, in their ſeveral Congregations and Forms, and are moſt zealous therein, are in theſe dayes the moſt bittereſt enemies to the miniſtration of Chriſt in the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and in truth. But when this miniſtration of the Spirit ſpreads himſelf, he will make the greateſt ſeparation that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was: for though Iſraels ſeparation out of <hi>Egypt</hi> amazed the World, and the ſeparation of gathered Congregations out of Pariſh Churches (ſo called) did trouble the earth, though it is no more but going out of one form into another, and none into the unity of the one Spirit: yet this miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit now riſing up by right of inheritance, will take peace from the World much more; for he hath begun, and he will go on to gather the ſcattered of Iſrael together out of all Egyptian bondages and ſelf-ſeeking oppreſſing Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and out of all forms and cuſtoms of the Beaſt, to worſhip the Father in ſpirit in and truth, being made to be all of one heart and one mind: and this ſhall more and more appear, as the day approacheth, which hath already daw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
            <p>Therefore let me tell you, that all your enmity will not uphold your forms; your impriſoning, and reviling, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Laws to ſuppreſs ſuch as are contrary to you, will never work your will, but pull miſeries and ſhame upon your ſelves, as the zealous Scribes and Phariſees did, in killing <hi>the juſt one</hi> Chriſt the Son of man. Therefore be patient, look up to him for teaching, <hi>from whom every good and perfect gift cometh down,</hi> even <hi>the Father of lights, in whom there is no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riableneſs
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:172640:11"/>
nor ſhadow of turning,</hi> who <hi>stands at the door and knocks; and if any man will open, he will come in and ſup with him; and the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth to dwell in the contrite ones,</hi> that he may give life unto them: for when the Law of righteouſneſs ariſeth up, and maketh himſelf more manifeſt, he will reconcile all, and make every one to be of one heart and of one mind; and no other power muſt be the reſtorer, but this King of righteouſneſs and peace: for this is he that makes men do as they would be done unto, and then envy and bitterneſs dies: ſee <hi>Act. 4. 32. Iſa.</hi> 60. 16. Now when this King, Jeſus, <hi>Emanuel God with us,</hi> ariſeth up in ſons and daughters, whereby the Scriptures are proved true Propheſies, Promiſes, Viſions, and Revelations; the Teachers of this World deny the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, crying out, Viſions and revelations are ceaſed, becauſe they would have the people ever learning of them, and <hi>gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their money</hi> to them <hi>for that which is not bread,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiteth not: for they can teach no further then they have learned; and they have learned no further then the declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which the Scripture it ſelf ſaith is but a dead Letter: it is a myſtery, and Chriſt revealeth it by his Spirit; and it is the Spirit that maketh known the deep and hidden things of God. Now when any <hi>receiveth power from on high,</hi> by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in him, and he maketh ſuch to eat the good of the Land, and they are forced to bear their Teſtimony to wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto others, as <hi>David</hi> did; he had not hid his goodneſs within his breaſt, but ſhewed even in the great Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what the Lord had done for his ſoul: I ſay, When any thus moved ſpeaketh to the Prieſts of our days, although Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture warrants <hi>ſpeaking one by one, as it is made manifeſt to them by the Spirit, and the first is to hold his peace;</hi> yet they preſently cry out, A diſturbance in their Steeple-houſe, and hale them to priſons, where many times the juſt ones of the Lord Jehovah die in the outward man by their hardſhips, as in <hi>Colcheſter</hi> Gaol, and other places in the Nation, by the Prieſts means, who poſſeſs the people with conceits, and make them believe their lies, that theſe people are ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited, and it is Errour and Blaſphemy they hold: even juſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:172640:12"/>
like thoſe that when the Holy Ghoſt had filled the Apoſtles and all thoſe that were with them, they cried out &amp; mocked, ſaying, <hi>Theſe men are filled with new wine;</hi> becauſe they knew not the voice of the Spirit: for <hi>the natural man knoweth not the things of God; they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, he is at hand, and is a working; for <hi>he that keepeth Iſrael neither ſlumbereth nor ſleepeth;</hi> and he will diſcover your ſhame, and make your nakedneſs appear unto all men: for <hi>wickedneſs ſhall ſlay the wicked, though no mans hands be upon him.</hi> The tender Lambs of Chriſt by the Wolves in ſheeps clothing are deſtroyed; but yet let the wolves know for their eternal woes, that the Lambs are the bleſſed of the moſt high: for the King of righteouſneſs is in them, for they are the field wherein the treaſure hath lain hid all the dark and cloudy days of the Beaſts Reign, which is now almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired: they are <hi>Zion whom no man regards,</hi> out of whom Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation cometh: for <hi>Jacob</hi> is in them, who hath been long a ſervant to <hi>Eſau,</hi> and now is ſet free, and he will glorifie himſelf both in them and for them, to the ſhame of all wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh <hi>Eſaus</hi> that are of a deſtroying nature: and the whole earth ſhall be filled by theſe with the knowledge of the Lord, of whoſe Dominion and Power there ſhall be no end: for the conſolation of Iſrael doth draw neer to be made manifeſt to every ones particular; therefore let all wait with patience for it, on him that is almighty, able to ſave: for Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus is <hi>able to ſave to the utmoſt all thoſe that come unto God by him;</hi> and for ever bleſſed are ſuch, for the Lord is their por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for it is the Law and power of righteouſneſs which made <hi>Abraham</hi> forſake his <hi>Iſaac,</hi> his deareſt Relations ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the fleſh, rather then to refuſe the way of his God; and by this he found peace: ſo that this King of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Prince of peace, that governed <hi>Abraham,</hi> and is called <hi>bleſſed,</hi> the <hi>bleſſing of all Nations, for this ſhall ſave his people from their ſins:</hi> for he ſhall remove from the Curſe, and reſtore his from the bondage they groane under; for <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> ſprang from him, as a tree groweth from a ſeed that gave the tree its being: the Law of righteouſneſs and peace ruling and dwelling in any one, is the ſeed of <hi>Abraham;</hi> and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:172640:12"/>
the ſeveral branches of men and women in whom that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reſts, are children, and of the family of <hi>Abraham:</hi> for it was not the man of the fleſh that was called <hi>Abraham,</hi> but the Law of righteouſneſs, and truth, and peace, that did rule and govern in that body, he was the <hi>Abraham:</hi> for it is clear, that before this righteous power was manifeſt in it, it was <hi>Abram,</hi> as you may read <hi>Gen. 17. 1. And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the Lord appeared unto Abram, and ſaid unto him, I am the Almighty God: walk before me and be thou perfit, and I will make my Covenant between thee and me:</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>Neither ſhall thy name be called any more A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bram, but thy name ſhall be called Abraham: for a father of many Nations have I made thee;</hi> And in <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees and Sadduces come to <hi>Johns</hi> Baptiſm, as you may ſee <hi>ver. 7. And he ſaid unto them, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come? bring forth fruits meet for repentance: &amp; think not to ſay within your ſelves, We have Abraham for our father; for God is able of theſe ſtones to raiſe up children unto Abraham.</hi> So it is plain, that Jew or Gentile in whom the power of righteouſneſs break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth forth and ruleth, are the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> Act. 10. 34. <hi>Of a truth I perceive that God is no reſpecter of perſons; but in every nation he that feareth him and worketh righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is accepted with him.</hi> For as the viſible body of Chriſt was not the anointing, but the Spirit in that body was the Chriſt, the ſpreading power of righteouſneſs, which was to fill the earth with himſelf; and his body but a houſe or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for the preſent work, to redeem the loſt man according to the promiſe, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the ſerpents head,</hi> as alſo to throw down <hi>Moſes</hi> Law; and became the ſubſtance of his Lambs, and Types, and Sacrifice; for that body was the Lamb that did fulfil the righteous will, by his voluntary and free-will offering up of himſelf: therefore Chriſt is called the ſpreading power, becauſe he fills all with himſelf; and becauſe this power did appear firſt to <hi>Abraham</hi> as we read of, therefore is he called <hi>The father of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful:</hi> for it was an everlaſting Covenant that God made with him; therefore every one that follows after him, and treads
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:172640:13"/>
in his ſteps, being <hi>willing and obedient, they ſhall eat the good of the land,</hi> and they ſhall be called children of that ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> which ſeed is the bleſſing of all Nations, and is the reſtorer of all his from bondage: and although his juſt ones many times lie under oppreſſion and hardſhip by the ſeed of the fleſh, and they are deſpiſed ones by them; yet now the day is at hand, that their glory ſhall ariſe: and the reaſon is, for the Almighty <hi>God is in them of a truth,</hi> &amp; he will <hi>lead their captivity captive,</hi> and ſet them down in peace: for they are the City of the Lord, new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the place of his reſt, which ſhall be <hi>the praiſe of the whole earth:</hi> for the Almighty King of righteouſneſs is their Saviour, and there is no other name under heaven whereby men can be ſaved, but the name of Jeſus; and verily I bear my Teſtimony from him, that he will be exalted in this the great day of his power, for the Lord is a bringing mighty things to paſs in this the day of his appearance, and the hearts of his ſhall fear: for, <hi>to him</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>will I look, that trembleth at my word;</hi> and therefore let all his redeemed ones wait patiently for the conſolation of Iſrael; for their King is coming, and he will fill the earth with his glory, and turn ungodlineſs from <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob: then ſhall Jacob rejoyce, and Iſrael ſhall be glad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>without controverſie, great is the mystery of godlineſs: God was manifeſt in the fleſh, juſtified in the Spirit, ſeen of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved up into glory.</hi> And that his might not be deceived, he ſaith, In the latter times ſeducing ſpirits ſhall come, and ſo cunningly carry themſelves, that if poſſible the very elect ſhould be deceived: and <hi>Paul 1 Tim.</hi> 4. 1, 2, 3, 4. ſheweth ſome of the principles of their deceit: and thus he ſaith: <hi>Now the Spirit ſpeaketh expreſly, that in the latter times ſome ſhall depart from the faith, giving heed to the ſeducing ſpirits and doctrines of devils, ſpeaking lies in hypocriſie, having their conſciences ſeared with a hot-iron; forbidding to marry, and commanding to abſtain from meats, which God hath created to be received with thanksgiving of them which believe and know the truth:</hi> for <hi>every creature of God is good,</hi> and nothing to be refuſed, <hi>if it be received with thanksgiving;</hi> for <hi>it is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:172640:13"/>
by the Word of God and prayer.</hi> And this <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts thoſe that will manifeſt themſelves good Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, ſuch who are nouriſhed up in the words of Faith and good Doctrine, that they ſhould <hi>put the brethren in minde of theſe things,</hi> and exerciſe themſelves in godlineſs: by which it appears, that <hi>Paul</hi> reckoneth ſuch as are before ſpoken of, amongſt <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus, who concerning the truth have erred, ſaying, The Reſurrection is paſt already, and overthrow the faith of ſome; nevertheleſs, the Foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, The Lord knoweth them that are His: and let every one that nameth the name of Chriſt, depart from iniquity.</hi> So that it is plain, that every act of evil is a fruit of old <hi>Adam,</hi> the fleſh, which hath nothing but envie, luſt, pride, drunkenneſs, malice, and all uncharitableneſs, which the King of Righteouſneſs, Chriſt Jeſus, redeemeth his from, and alſo maketh his righteous, godly, full of faith, love, pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, meekneſs, being without ſpot, unrebukable: for they are <hi>born again, not of corruptible ſeed, but of incorruptible,</hi> by the word of God, <hi>which liveth and abideth for ever;</hi> which word is <hi>Chriſt in them the hope of glory:</hi> For <hi>Moſes</hi> truly ſaid unto the Fathers, <hi>A Prophet ſhall the Lord your God raiſe up unto you of your brethren, like unto me; Him ſhall ye hear in all things whatſoever he ſhall ſay unto you.</hi> So that it is plain, that the Lamb Chriſt Jeſus, was the ſubſtance of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and where the ſubſtance is, ſhadows and Types doth ceaſe: and this method of divine Diſcovery doth fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Myſtery; for the Lord doth take up all into Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for he is in all, and acts through all; and all that power of Righteouſneſs that appeareth in any, is ſtill but that pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Lord which he hath promiſed to pour forth in the laſt dayes, as you may ſee in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts, verſ. 17, 18. And it ſhall come to paſs in the laſt dayes, ſaith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all fleſh: and your ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhall propheſie, and your young men ſhall ſee viſions, and your old men ſhall dream Dreams; and on my ſervants, and on my hand-maids, will I pour out of my Spirit in thoſe dayes, and they ſhall propheſie.</hi> So that every Branch ſhall be a Joynt or Member of the Myſtical Body, or ſeveral ſpreadings

forth of the Vine, being filled with that one Spirit, Chriſt the anointing, who filleth all with himſelf, and ſo becomes the alone King of Righteouſneſs, that rules and governes all his ranſomed ones, <hi>Joh. 17. 23. I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one, that the world may know that thou haſt ſent me, and haſt loved them as thou haſt loved me: For I am the Lord, and beſide me there is no Saviour.</hi> He is in every one of his little ones that are born again; and how, is declared, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14. v. 15, 16, 17, 18. <hi>If you love me, keep my commandments: and I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; even the Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receive, becauſe it ſeeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him, for he dwelleth with you, and ſhall be in you: I will not leave you comfortleſs; I will come to you. Yet a little while, and the world ſeeth me no more, but ye ſee me: becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo. At that day ye ſhall know that I am in my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and you in me, and I in you. He that hath my command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me; and he that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth me, ſhall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and manifeſt my ſelf unto him: if a man love me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him; and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> And <hi>Rom. 8. 9. Now if any man hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his; for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are Sons of God,</hi> verſ. 14. Epheſ. 1. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaking to them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their <hi>faith in the Lord Jeſus,</hi> as he had heard, and their <hi>love unto all Saints;</hi> he <hi>ceaſed not to give thanks for them, making mention of them in his prayers; that the God of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of glory, may give unto them the Spirit of wiſdom and revelation in the knowledge of him; the eyes of their underſtandings being enlightned, that they may know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints, and what is the exceeding great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his power, to usward, who believe, according to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his mighty power, which he wrought in Chriſt, when he raiſed him from the dead, and ſet him at his own right hand, in the heavenly places, far above all principalities, and power, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:172640:14"/>
might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not onely in this world, but alſo in that which is to come; and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the Church, which is his Body, the fulneſs of him that filleth all in all.</hi> Which Myſtery was made known to <hi>Paul</hi> by Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; and he expreſly ſaith, That this Myſtery in Chriſt was not made known unto the ſons of men in other ages, as it is now revealed unto his Apoſtles and Prophets, which is made known by the Spirit; and that is, that the Gentiles ſhould be fellow-heirs, and of the ſame Body, and partakers of his promiſe in Chriſt: and to this end, he prayeth for them, that they may be ſtrengthened in the inner man, by the riches of his glory, with might, by his Spirit; that Chriſt may dwell in their hearts by Faith, that they may be filled with all the fulneſs of God, and may grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Chriſt Jeſus in them the hope of glory, which cleanſeth all his from all filthineſs, that they may perfect holineſs in his fear: for they that have learned Chriſt, and been taught by him, as the Truth is in Jeſus, they put off all uncleanneſs and laſciviouſneſs, they put off the old man, with his deeds, which is, lying, deceipt, luſt, evil ſpeaking; they muſt not be angry, neither give place to the devil, nor his Temptations; againſt which they muſt keep a continual watch, that they may not fall; they muſt let no rotten nor corrupt communication proceed out of their mouths, but that which is good to the uſe of edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it may miniſter grace to the hearers; and all bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, wrath, anger, and evil ſpeaking, and clamour, muſt be put away, with all malice, drunkenneſs and fornication, fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs and fooliſh jeſting. And that which maketh mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt ſin, is the light in every one; for all things are reproved and made manifeſt by the light; for whatſoever doth make manifeſt, is light: and therefore awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtand up from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light; and wait on the Lord, to be filled with his Spirit; for we are members of his Body, of his fleſh, and of his bones; that you may be ſtrong in the Lord, and the power of his might, that puting on the whole Armour of God, they may be able
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:172640:15"/>
to ſtand againſt the wiſes of Sathan; for they are not onely to wreſtle againſt fleſh and blood, but againſt principalities, and powers, againſt the Rulers of the darkneſs of this world, againſt ſpiritual wickedneſſes in high places; and therefore they muſt have their loins girt about with truth, and having on the breſt-plate of Righteouſneſs, the ſword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, that enlightneth every one that cometh into the world, Chriſt in you the hope of glory: for they that are Chriſts, crucifie the fleſh, with the affections, and luſts: and he maketh his walk as he hath walked, to be holy as he is holy, and pure as he is pure; to count all things but loſs and dung, that they may win Chriſt, for whom they ſuffer the loſs of all things, that they may know him, and the power of his Reſurrection, and the fellowſhip of his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, being made conformable to his death, that they may attain unto the Reſurrection of the dead; forgetting thoſe things that are behinde, and reaching after thoſe things that are before, that they may attain unto perfection; having their converſations in heaven, from whence they look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall change their vile bodies, that they may be faſhioned according to his glorious body, according to that working whereby he is able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due all things unto himſelf; and therefore they are careful for nothing, but in every thing, by prayer, and thankſgiving, and ſupplication, their Requeſts are made known unto God; and thoſe things that are true, juſt, pure, and of good report, peaceable, and lovely, bowels of compaſſion, kindneſs, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of minde, meekneſs, long-ſuffering, charity, that whatſoever they do, in word or deed, they may and ought to do all in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, giving thanks to God the Father by him: &amp; this is the fruits the Saints are clothed with, which doth demonſtrate their new birth, which gift is from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, from the Father of ſpirits, from whom they receive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to become the ſons of God, by believing in his Name. <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, the days come, ſaith the Lord, that I will raiſe unto David a righteous Branch; and a King ſhall reign and proſper, and ſhall execute judgement and juſtice in the earth: In his dayes Judah ſhall be ſaved, and Iſrael ſhall dwell ſafely; and this is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:172640:15"/>
his Name whereby he ſhall be called, THE LORD O<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>R RIGHTEO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SNESS:</hi> For he is that mighty King that ſhall be eſtabliſhed upon the holy Hill of <hi>Sion;</hi> that is, he ſhall be the onely King, unto whom every man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man muſt be ſubject; for He ſhall Reign for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>But here may an Objection ariſe: We ſee the power of darkneſs reigns in moſt men and women, and they are guided by the god of this world, who ruleth in the hearts of the children of diſobedience; for the Myſtery of Iniquity doth work in them, with all deceivableneſs in unrighteouſneſs, in them that periſh, to whom the Lord ſendeth ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould believe lies, that they all might be damned, that would not receive the truth in the love of it, but took pleaſure (mark this) in unrighteouſneſs; ſo it is ſin is the cauſe of all miſery.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, That all men by nature are children of wrath; but God, who is rich in mercie, giveth unto all a tender of grace, for he ſtands at the door, and knocketh; if any man open, he will come in, and ſup with him. Now there is a meaſure of the light of Chriſt in every one, which is given to profit withal: and when he cometh, he deſtroyeth ſin, or taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſin, for he came to deſtroy the works of the devil; and he will conſume and deſtroy all ſin, by the brightneſs of his power, for he is ſtronger then the ſtrong man, that divideth the ſpoils, and taketh from him whatſoever he truſteth in. So that whatſoever eſtate a ſon or daughter is in, it is ſtill but Chriſt combating with his Enemies, in that eſtate, drawing all into himſelf, and deſtroying all oppoſing powers, that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf may remain to be the one alone Almighty power, ſpread forth every where; and ſo doing the will of the Father, bruiſing the ſerpents head in them that believe, that he alone who is the Divine, may grow up, flouriſh and remain, and bring forth abundance of fruit in them, when their created fleſh is purged from bondage, and made ſubject unto him in all things; for they that are in Chriſt, ought ſo to walk as Chriſt hath walked, who did no evil, neither was there guile found in his mouth; ſo that every one ſpeaking the truth in

And the new heaven and the new earth, mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 5. 13. wherein he who is King of Righteouſneſs doth dwell and rule, and they that are his redeemed ones, ſhall ſee him in all his creatures, and they ſhall all rejoyce in each other, and all their joy in him ſhall be full. This great Myſtery, Chriſt, is begun to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and Chriſt is ariſing, and drawing all his into himſelf: and he that hath part in the firſt Reſurrection, over him the ſecond death ſhall have no power. <hi>For there is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked;</hi> there is no peace ſo long as deceipt lodgeth in the heart: <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, God will not hear me;</hi> there can be no quiet nor true peace in man, till the Kingdom of Darkneſs be conquered, and the ſerpent be caſt out, and all his works; and then ſuch a heart is made a fit Temple for the holy Ghoſt, to dwell bodily in: for all Chriſts enemies muſt to the fire, and when they are burnt up, then he reignes in the ſoul; for <hi>unto us a Child is born, and unto us a Son is given, and the Government ſhall be upon his ſhoulder; and his name ſhall be called, Wonderful, Counſellour, the mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace; of the increaſe of his Government and Peace, there ſhall be no end:</hi> and thoſe that wait or ſtay themſelves on the Lord, he keepeth ſuch in perfect Peace. For it is Righteouſneſs that delivereth from Death, even death eternal; and therefore it concerneth every man and woman to wait, that he may feel that power of righteouſneſs, the Lord ſubduing every luſt in them, bringing all into ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is contrary to him, that Chriſt alone may Rule. Open the gates, and ſtand open ye everlaſting doors, that the King of glory may enter in, which is Jeſus, who will caſt out all ſin, that he may preſent his without ſpot unto the Father: for the Lord hateth every hypocrite, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 9. 17. and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Wo unto you Scribes and Phariſees, hypocrites:</hi> for wickedneſs burneth as a fire, and through the wrath of the Lord of Hoſts is the Land darkned, and the people ſhall be as fewel of the

            </p>
            <p>And therefore all you ſtout-hearted Magiſtrates that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and deſtroy his holy ones in this the day of the Lords power, fear and tremble, for he is coming to puniſh the ſtout heart of the King, and all that do wickedly under him: and he pronounceth wo unto all them that make or decree un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous decrees, and that write grievouſneſs, and ſubſcribe it, to turn aſide the needy from judgement, and take away the right from the poor, that widows may be their prey, and that they may rob the fatherleſs: What will you do in this the day of the Lords viſitation, which will bring deſolation upon all oppreſſours? for they ſhall be troden down as dirt in the ſtreets, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 10. 6. And all thoſe that kill the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and ſtone the juſt ones that are ſent unto them, to turn them from the evil of their doings: Let them fear and tremble before him, for fear he require at the hands of them the bloud of all the Prophets ſlain from the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the World: for the wicked ſhall be turned into hell, and all people that forget God: for the Lord is known by the judgements which he executeth, in ſnaring the wicked in the works of his own hands: for the Lord will break in pieces all unjuſt oppreſſing Magiſtrates like a Potters veſſel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be wiſe now therefore O ye Kings, be learned ye Judges of the earth; ſerve the Lord in fear, and rejoyce in trembling; kiſs the Son, leſt he be angry, and ye periſh in the way; when his wrath ſhall ſuddenly burn, then bleſſed are all they that truſt in him.</hi> For nothing but truth in the inward parts can ſtand before him, and therefore every one wait till this King Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who is the Word, and was in the beginning; and all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made: for in him is life, and the life is the light of men, which is the true light that lightneth every man that cometh into the world: and to all thoſe that do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this light, in the love of it, to them he gives power to <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thou vain man, what can deceive Antichriſt? what can deceive a Drunkard, a Whoremonger, an unclean Swearer, Lyer, Covetous man, who is an Idolater? are not theſe led by the Prince of Darkneſs, that ruleth in the hearts of the children of diſobedience? Cannot all men ſee that they are in darkneſs? and can the light of the World, Chriſt Jeſus, can he delude them? theſe are plainly lulled aſleep by Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in a carnal ſecurity, and <hi>cry peace, peace, until ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction cometh upon them, as travail upon a woman with child, and they ſhall not eſcape it.</hi> Therefore let me adviſe ſuch to wait and repent, if poſſible, that this the ſin of the thoughts of their hearts may be forgiven them: for they are in the gall of bitterneſs, and the bond of iniquity. For I bear my teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from the everlaſting Spirit of the Lord Jeſus, that this which hath been declared, is the truth of God, and will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his povver unto Salvation unto every one that can lay hold upon him: for they ſhall put on the nevv man, vvhich after God is created in righteouſneſs and true holineſs, vvhoſe converſation is in heaven, from vvhence they look for the Saviour, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, vvho ſhall change their vile bodies, that they may be faſhioned like unto his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body, according to the vvorking vvhereby he is able to ſubdue all things unto himſelf: for Chriſt by his appearance vvith the Spirit of his mouth, vvill burn up all the curſed ſeed of bondage, under vvhich his redeemed ones groane; and vvhen that vvhich is the Serpents ſeed is caſt forth, then the heart is a fit Temple for the Father himſelf to dvvel in, a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den vvherein he vvill take delight: for the Lord vvill be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone exalted in this the great day of his povver, vvherein <hi>Judah</hi> ſhall be ſaved, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall dvvell ſafely: and <hi>this

            </p>
            <p>Now the Prieſts of this Generation delude the People, juſt like thoſe ſpoken of, <hi>Jer. 23. 14. I have ſeen in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of Jeruſalem an horrible thing, they commit adultery, and walk in lies; they ſtrengthen the hands of evil doers, that none doth return out of his wickedneſs:</hi> for the Lord feedeth them with Wormwood, and giveth them Gall to drink; for the Lord expreſly ſaith, <hi>They ſhall not profit his people;</hi> for they ſpeak a Divination of their own heart, and not out of the mouth of the Lord; and they tell the people, if they walk after the imaginations of their own hearts, no evil ſhall come upon them: <hi>I have not ſent theſe Prophets</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>yet they run; I have not ſpoken to them, yet they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied:</hi> but if they had ſtood in my counſel, and had cauſed my people to hear my words, then they ſhould have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings. Am I a God at hand, ſaith the Lord, and not a God afar off? can any hide himſelf in ſecret places, that I ſhall not ſee him, ſaith the Lord? do not I fill heaven and earth, ſaith the Lord? how long ſhall this be in the hearts of the Prophets that propheſie lies? yea, they are Prophets of the deceipt of their own hearts, which think to cauſe my people to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get my Name, by the dreams which they tell every man to his Neighbour, as their fathers have forgotten my Name for <hi>Baal.</hi> Therefore am I againſt the Prophets, ſaith the Lord, that ſteal my word every one from his Neighbour, therefore they ſhall not profit this people at all, ſaith the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now let the Prieſts be tried, do they know the voice of the Lord? do they not deny, and ſay, Revelation is ceaſed, and teach men cannot be freed from ſin while they live, and teach people to die in their ſin? and what will become of them then? for as the Tree falleth, ſo it lyeth; and there is no repentance in the grave. Well, look to it, woes will be your portion, <hi>Jer. 23. 40. The Lord will bring an everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reproach upon you, and a perpetual ſhame, which ſhall not be forgotten.</hi> And therefore let me ſeriouſly deſire every one to wait patiently upon the Lord, and to turn in to the light
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:172640:18"/>
of their mindes, that checketh for ſin and evil: for this is the true Teacher: for that which giveth power over one ſin, will give power over all ſin, if the watch be carefully kept; and ſtrength from on high will be manifeſted to give power againſt all ſin, if the minde be turned to the Lord, who will ſeek that which was loſt, and bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that which was broken, and they ſhall be ſafe: And thus ſhall they know that I the Lord their God am with them, and that they are my people, ſaith the Lord God: for they know the Word of the Lord for ever ſettled in heaven, and they make my Law their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, and will never forget my Precepts, but will meditate on my Law day and night: for Chriſt ſaveth his from their ſins. He it is that cometh out of <hi>Sion,</hi> to turn ungodlineſs from <hi>Jacob:</hi> and the time ſhall come, that the Kingdoms of this world ſhall become the Kingdoms of the Lord Chriſt, and he will lead the captivity captive, and let the Priſoners of hope go free; now they that hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs, ſhall be filled; and the poor receive the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel dayly: Chriſt is drawing all men after him; he is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in the Iſles and Nations of the world, to come to this great Battle: and bleſſed for ever are all thoſe that fighteth under him, and are his ſouldiers. <hi>I give thee thanks, O Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Lord of heaven and earth, becauſe thou haſt hidden theſe things from the wiſe and learned, and haſt revealed them unto Babes;</hi> for ſuch have the anointing from the Anointed, as you may ſee in 1 <hi>Joh. 2. 27. But that anointing which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of him, dwelleth in you; and you need not that any man teach you, but as the ſame anointing teacheth you of all things; and it is true, and is not lying, and as it taught you, ye ſhall a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in him: and now little children abide in him, if ye know that he is righteous, know ye that he that doth righteouſneſs is born of him:</hi> For he that findeth reſt and peace in this precious wiſdom and power of the Spirit, findeth it not by looking upon it at a diſtance, but by ſeeing and feeling that power, ruling in the Body of his fleſh; for that which makes true love flow forth to every creature, is Chriſt in you the hope of glory, who indeed is the Bleſſing of all nations, and the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:172640:18"/>
Joy of the whole earth; <hi>Therefore fear not, O Servant Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, neither be affraid, O Iſrael: for I will ſave thee, and thou ſhalt dwell ſafely;</hi> and ſhalt not follow me in Types and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, in a formal cuſtomary way of worſhip, which is zeal without knowledge; for he that hath the anointing within, ſeeth the Father in every thing.</p>
            <p>Now he that ſpeaketh from imagination or tradition, and not from experience of what he ſeeth, cannot tell another of his evil, but ſuch a one is a falſe Prophet, and runneth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is ſent, put forward by ſome ſecret luſt; and he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can bring to that which procureth peace, for he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it not; becauſe that which a man ſeeks for, whereby he might have peace, is within the heart, not without: The Word of life, Chriſt, the reſtoring Spirit, is to be found with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you, even in-your mouths, and in your hearts; the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven is within you. And therefore I muſt tell you the Prieſts of this generation, Read all the Books in your Univerſities, that tells you what hath been formerly; and though by your natural parts, with the help of ſuch Studies, you can make ſpeeches of a day long, yet you have no peace, but your hearts ſtill are as a barren wilderneſs, and increaſe in ſorrow, till your eyes return into your ſelves, and the Spirit come from on high to make you read in your own Book, your heart, wherein you ſhall find the Myſtery of Iniquity, the Man of Sin ſeated, which is the fruits of the firſt <hi>Adam:</hi> and till the Myſtery of Godlineſs, the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, be revealed in you, to deſtroy the works of the devil, and make you righteous, and reſtore you to life, there is not neither can there be peace: for <hi>there is no peace to the wicked, ſaith my God:</hi> and, <hi>if I regard iniquity in my heart, God will not hear me:</hi> and, <hi>he that liveth in ſin, the wrath of God abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth upon him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So it is clear, that the ſingle-hearted ones, who ſee the Myſtery of Righteouſneſs, and are acquainted every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his meaſure, with that Spirit of truth that is to be the Bleſſing of the whole earth, and that enlightens all that come into the world, although they are ſlightly regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and trodden under foot of men of the world, whom God
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:172640:19"/>
filleth with his hid treaſure, that have every worldly thing their hearts can wiſh for, that their eyes many times are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſtart out for fatneſs: yet let them know for their ſorrow and wo, that out of this <hi>Sion,</hi> which no man regards, ſhall the Deliverer come: for the light and life of Chriſt vvithin the heart, diſcovers all Darkneſs, and delivers Mankinde from Bondage; and beſide him there is no Saviour: and what vvill become of thoſe that are found fighters againſt God? for <hi>they that perſecute them, perſecute me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt. And therefore fear and tremble, vvhoever rhou art, for the wrath of the Lord ſmoaketh againſt thee, and his jealouſie burneth like fire: if thou art found in a perſecuting nature, thy ſin will bring deſtruction upon thee, and there ſhall be no reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Although judgement is not executed ſpeedily againſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil doers, which cauſeth their hearts to be ſet in them to do evil, yet the Lord will puniſh the hairy ſcalp of them that go on in their wickedneſs; and when their ſins are fully ripe, then judgement ſhall come upon them to the utmoſt, and there ſhall be no Remedy: and therefore, O Man, who ever thou art, great or ſmall, that fighteth or ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth againſt his little ones, fear and tremble, and ceaſe from ſinning any longer in that nature, for fear the Lord may be a heaping up thy iniquities, that he may bring wrath upon thee to the utmoſt, and then there ſhall be no remedy; for he repayeth them that hate him to their face, to deſtroy them, he will not be ſlack. <hi>Deut. 7. 10, 21. For the Lord thy God is amongſt you; a mighty God, and terrible;</hi> who is now ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in his might and power, to deſtroy the man of ſin, and is riſing like a mighty man, refreſhed after Wine, and the ſeed of wickedneſs ſhall be deſtroyed by the brightneſs and glory of his coming: for he alone that is the King of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs will be exalted amongſt you. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>let all fleſh ſtand ſtill, waiting in ſilence before him, that they may ſee the Salvation of GOD.</hi>

Hearken to the Word of the Lord, and your ſouls ſhall live: mind what power rules in you, whether it be a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, confining, ſelfiſh power, which is of the devil, or whether it be an univerſal, ſpreading power, that doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the liberty of the Son: for <hi>if the Son ſhall make you free, then are you free indeed.</hi> The ſelfiſh power vvhen it is croſſed or ſhamed, it grows diſtempered, bitter ſpirited, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times endeavouring to kill that bodie it dwels in, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſome other that angers it: but the power of Chriſt, who is the giver forth of the Law of Righteouſneſs, ruling within, is not moved to anger: charity, true love, thinketh not evil, but hopeth, and endureth all things, being meek and patient, loving and acting righteouſly, both to his own Body, and to others, though they be his Enemies, following the Rule of Jeſus Chriſt their King, Do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that deſpightfully uſe you, that you may be children of your Father which is in heaven.</p>
            <p>Let every man and woman know, that there is but two Spirits, a good and a bad; there is but two wayes, the ſtraight and the narrow, that leadeth to life eternal, and few find it; and the broad way, that leadeth to deſtruction, and many there be that go in that vvay: there is but God and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Heaven and hell; the way to happineſs, and the way to miſery; the way to life, and the way to death, even death

eternal. And the way to life, is believing in the light that doth enlighten every man that cometh into the world.</p>
            <p>And verily it doth concern every man to know in what ſtate he is, whether the ſpirit or the fleſh beareth ſway: for the two powers before ſpoken of, are the two <hi>Adams</hi> in mankinde; they are <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> ſon of the free-vvo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, or ſon of bondage: the firſt kills and crucifieth the Son of God; but the ſecond, the Lord from heaven, he maketh alive: for Chriſt the Spirit of Truth, doth ariſe above the power of evil; and he takes the body, and rules in it: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65. 17. he makes it a new heaven and a new earth, vvhere in dwells righteouſneſs. Now that vvhich ſeeks after the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of Creatures, to have peace in them, doth but ſeek the living among the dead: for all ſin makes but one perfect body of the power of darkneſs, the devil, vvhich doth raign in every man, till the man of righteouſneſs, Chriſt, the ſtronger then he, vvho is the Anointing, comes and throws down his ſtrong holds, and divides the ſpoil: and vvhen Chriſt this Word of life hath the poſſeſſion, that ſoul hath true peace in the ſalvation that cometh out of Sion: for peace is not to be found in any other: for he is the <hi>Prince of peace,</hi> and the <hi>Captain of our ſalvation,</hi> vvho hath perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted for ever all thoſe that are ſanctified by him; and he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver liveth to make interceſſion for them: for by his obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence many are made righteous. <hi>Every one ſhall be called by my name: for I created him for my glory, formed him and made him.

This people have I formed for my ſelf; they ſhall ſhew forth my praiſe.</hi> And all the ſeed of the Serpent ſhall be deſtroyed; and the power of darkneſs is that curſed ground that is for burning, vvhich the Lord of life and glory vvill trample upon; for he came into the world to deſtroy the works of the devil; and all things ſhall be ſubdued by his power, and he vvill put all things under his feet: and then when

all things are brought under by this Prince of peace, then the ſoul ſits down in peace in him who is the King of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, vvho will make all that living earth ſubject to himſelf, and fill all with holy breathings.

            <p>Therefore let not any one marvel to ſee the people turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from one way of Worſhip to another: for the Father is driving his people thorow all the Ways, and Forms, and Cuſtoms, and Reformations, and Governments of the Beaſt, to weary them out in all, that ſo they may not find reſt for the ſoles of their feet, in any outward form of Worſhip, nor in any thing until they come to lie down in him, forſaking all Forms to worſhip the Father in Spirit and in Truth; that is, to walk uprightly, being holy in all manner of Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; for it is written, <hi>Be ye holy, as I am holy; and paſs the time of your ſojourning here in his fear, knowing that ye were not redeemed with corruptible things, as ſilver and gold, from your vain converſations in time paſt, but with the pretious blood of Chriſt Jeſus, as a Lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world.</hi> And until Chriſt reigneth as Lord and King, the ſoul is reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, running from poſt to pillar, as I may ſo call it, from one Worſhip and Form to another, meeting nothing but confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and the curſe in every thing he doth; ſo poor creatures are in bondage within, for they know not what to do; the way to <hi>Sion</hi> is not yet clear, and they are filled with ſighings and ſecret mournings, to ſee themſelves in confuſion and loſs, to ſtick in the mire, but cannot get out: this is inward ſlavery which they groan under, being under the hand of the Tyrant fleſh that rules the Kingdom, and deviſes the ſeveral fleſhly Forms and Ways of Government, to which, if any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to conform, then he thinks fit to puniſh them with impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonment or ſhameful reproach, any way he can invent; ſo that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:172640:21"/>
many weak ſpirits are brought under, and are in awe, either by fear or ſhame; and thus <hi>Jacoh</hi> hath been kept very low, but he muſt ariſe. To ſee the Divine Power in Creature-Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects is ſweet, but to ſee him ruling in the heart, is ſweeter: for the Spouſe had ſeen Chriſt, or elſe ſhe could never have called him her Beloved, and mourned in his abſence. Now all things, yea all things, muſt be but loſs, dung, and Dogs meat, that we may be found in him, having the Law of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and Peace ruling and dwelling in our hearts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing refreſhed with thoſe ſweet ſmelling Spices, the diſcovery of the Fathers Love within, which is the Word of God. This is ſweeter then the Honey and the Honey-Comb; for this is to ſee him neer at hand, even within the heart, ruling and reſting there: This is the Kingdom of Heaven within you; this the City of Refuge that will not fail a man; this is the Rock of Defence and Offence: this is the Power that makes a man as bold as a Lyon, that in the greateſt ſtreights findeth peace and reſt: like <hi>Paul,</hi> can ſing at midnight, although in chains under the hardſhip of perſecution by Tyrants, for he felt peace, and was at reſt; yea, ſuch peace as the world knows not of: let come what will come, this man knows it is the will of his Father it ſhall be ſo, and he feels a quiet peace compaſs his heart, ſo that he ſeeth and feeleth peace within, and rejoyceth in the excellencie of it; he ſeeth love and patience within, and rejoyceth in that ſweet Oyntment that doth caſt a delightful ſavour all his ſoul over.

ſingle eye, and judge others righteouſly, and they ſhall not be judged of any man. And let the ignorant Profeſſors of the world be aſhamed, for condemnation will fall upon them, and fear ſhall ſurprize the hypocrites: for the righteous act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and patient ſilence of thoſe that are drawn up to wait on the Lord, ſhall be the great ſhame and confuſion of face up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; the wiſe fleſh, that would be an Angel of light, is full of words, but dead to the Law of Righteouſneſs: the Saints muſt dye to waſte words, but be made alive to righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, walking uprightly to all things, in all well-pleaſing, in the ſight of God their heavenly Father: for the man of the fleſh is altogether for preaching, praying, as he calls it, obſervations of Forms and Cuſtoms, and knows not how to worſhip, if theſe be taken away; he hath no peace if this be gone. But the man that is in his natural condition, that is not born again, this mans prayer ſhall turn into ſin, and all that ever he doth is an Abomination in the ſight of God, and he that hath his eyes in his head, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith the wiſeman hath, he beholds all theſe his performances to be out of the life and power of Chriſt, and death is in all that ever he doth: let his ſpecious fair pretences be what they will, if the inward Power be wanting, no Sacrifice can be accepted: therefore the clean heart God accepteth; therefore the juſt man is continually meditating, the Law of his God is in his heart, therefore his footſteps ſhall not ſlide. The godly man turns his eye inward to ſee the Law of Righteouſneſs guiding and ruling his body; and this is the excellent ſight, to ſee the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Power in ones ſelf, ruling, dwelling and living within; which if it doth, that Body wherein it dwells, ſhall be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject in all its actions to the Law of Righteouſneſs. They that know what the power of Love, and the Law of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs is, they know the truth of what is here verified: they that live in the light, they ſee the Lord abroad and at home; they ſee him in other creatures, and they ſee him in themſelves; patiently ſubmitting to his will in all things, that it may <hi>be done on earth, as it is in heaven;</hi> ſo that there is a ſweet compoſed agreement between the diſpoſing hand of God without, and his power within. He that thus ſeeth the Lord
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:172640:22"/>
the Antient of dayes, the one Almighty power, doth mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly honour him, when nothing can be done abroad, either in adverſity or in proſperity, but the divine power that rules in the heart, conſents, rejoyces, and doth not grudge: And now the Lord is one, and his Name one, and his power one, every where.</p>
            <p>The ſight of the King of Glory within, lies not in the ſtrength of Memory, calling to minde what a man hath read and heard, being able by a humane capacity to joyn things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into a method, and through the power of free utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to hold it forth to others, as the faſhion of Students in their Sermon-work is, which a plough-man that never was bred in the Univerſities, may do as much; nay, they do more, in ſome kind, as experience teaches. But the ſight of the King of glory within, lies in the beholding of light ariſing up from an inward power of feeling experience, filling the ſoul with the glory of the Law of Righteouſneſs, which doth not vaniſh like the taking in of words and comfort from the mouth of a hear-ſay-Prieſt, who doth ſpeak by the ſtrength of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; but it doth continue like the Sun in the Firmament, ſhining forth from that eſtabliſhed power of the Divine within; and the inlivened heart ſhall ſooner be ſeparated from glorying in the Law of Righteouſneſs that dwells in him, then the light and heat of the Sun, can be ſeparated from the Sun: and truly, let me tell you, that as a man finds abundance of ſweet peace in his heart, when he is made to live in the Kingdom of Heaven; ſo the words that this man ſpeaks from this power within, are very profitable to others, and is good ſeed, whereſoever it is ſown, that will ſpring up, and bring forth fruit: for vvords ſpoken from the light of experience, have a two-fold operation upon the hearts of the hearers: for firſt, if I lie under ſtraits and bondage in my ſpirit, by reaſon of ſome inward and outward troubles, by reaſon of the enthraldom to my ovvn luſts, that overpowers me, ſo that I cannot do what I would; then the words of experience from anothers mouth that hath been in the ſame condition, and is paſſed thorow it, ſounds liberty and life to my weary ſoul: I ſpeak what I have felt in this particular.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:172640:22"/>
Secondly, If I delight in any way of the fleſh, as to ſeek peace in Creatures abroad vvithout me, or to ſeek ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to my ſelf-vvill and luſt, in the midſt of this, I do (oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally) hear the vvords of experience from others, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſuch actions and motions to be the powers of the fleſh and devil, and not of the ſpirit of Righteouſneſs; preſently theſe vvords take peace from the earth, that is, from proud fleſh, and fills the vvhole ſoul vvith anger, diſtemper, gradg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and torment: and this is another operation that pure Language produceth, vvhich is, a launcing of the dead fleſh, that the diſeaſe may be cured; for this wounding is not to the ruine of the creature, but it is a Medicine ſent from the Lord to heal him, to take away the evil peace from the fleſh, that ſo the created part may lie down in reſt, and be at peace in Chriſt which cannot be moved: for every comfort that is of the fleſh, ſhall be ſhaken and removed; but Chriſt the one povver of Righteouſneſs and Peace, ſhall not be ſhaken nor moved, but ſtand firm for ever.</p>
            <p>Now by this may you ſee the Kingdom of the fleſh and devil, vvhich muſt be ſhaken to pieces, and fall, and the Kingdom of Heaven, or of God, that endures for ever, and is that Rock that cannot be removed.</p>
            <p>For every one that hath lain under the bondage of ſelfiſh power, and is delivered, he can from that experience, declare vvhat the power of darkneſs is, in vvhole mankind.</p>
            <p>Now ſome may ſay, <hi>What is it for a man to live in the Kingdom of Hell, Devil, or Darkneſs?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer: When a man takes delight in nothing but ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the luſts of his own heart; vvhen the vvay of the fleſh is pleaſing, and the vvay of the ſpirit of Righteouſneſs is a burden to him; vvhen he glories in himſelf, and feeds vvith delight upon his Covetouſneſs, Pride, Envie, Luſt, Self-vvill, and in all other Evil, that doth ſatisfie his devil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh appetite; and if he can but overcome that power that checketh his will, or croſſeth his carnal delights, then this man is in his Kingdom, he rejoyceth, and is well pleaſed. But yet know, thou vain Man, that this is yet but the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the fleſh, that muſt be ſhaken, and this earth muſt be
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:172640:23"/>
removed; for this is glorying in a mans ſhame.</p>
            <p>What is the Kingdom of Heaven, or of Chriſt?</p>
            <p>The Law of Righteouſneſs and Peace, ruling and dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in mankinde, is the Kingdom of Heaven; for this is the univerſal power bearing rule, and therefore treadeth the ſelfiſh power under his feet; for all his delight is in the Law of the Lord, and in that Law he doth exerciſe himſelf both day and night. Now vvhere the heart is thus eſtabliſhed vvith grace, there is perfect peace; and that which is perfect peace, is the Kingdom of Heaven within you: yea, it is the <hi>White ſtone, with the new name written in it, that none know it but them that have it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is it for a man to live in the Kingdom of Heaven within you?</p>
            <p>When a man is come to that condition by believing in the light, that he is brought over the works of darkneſs, and is made ſubject in every thing to the King of Righteouſneſs, Jeſus Chriſt, and all his delight is to walk according to his Law in every thing, his Crown and Glory being in that Law of Righteouſneſs which he findes ſeated in his heart, and findes content no where elſe; and when the Spirit is honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this man is in his Kingdom, he hath vvhat he would have: for vvhen a man is made to ſee and know the Law of Love and Righteouſneſs within him, and delights to act from that power of life and liberty which he ſeeth &amp; feeleth ſeated in him; now this man is carried on with much joy &amp; ſweet calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, meekneſs and moderation, and is full of glory: this is the excellencie of the work of Chriſt, not onely to make fleſh ſubject to Righteouſneſs, but to know himſelf made ſubject, and to rejoyce in the ſweet enjoyment of that Prince of peace: to make a man rejoyce, and to know the ground of it, that his joy is unmoveable.</p>
            <p>What do you mean by Divine Power?</p>
            <p>The Divine is the ſpreading power of righteouſneſs, which is Chriſt that <hi>filleth all in all</hi> with himſelf, &amp; he is called <hi>a Tree,</hi> or <hi>a Vine,</hi> becauſe he doth not lie in any ſingle perſon, but ſpreads himſelf in all mankind; &amp; every ſingle body in vvhom
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:172640:23"/>
he breathes, is but a bough or bud of the Vine: ſo that look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all together in whom Chriſt is ſpread, and they make up but one Vine, knit together by that one Spirit into one Body, vvhether they be poor or rich, learned or unlearned; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe rich men that deſpiſe the poor, and thoſe learned that deſpiſe the unlearned, as your Univerſity men and Prieſts of the Nation doth, for there is ſome Prieſts now in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that vvere not bred in the Univerſity: but know all of you that are deſpiſers of them that are good, and have them in contempt for their poverty, and becauſe they are unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in your Logick and Tongues, as men are; vvhy I muſt tell you, you are all but pricks of the Thorn-buſh, not Branches of the Vine, and you are the curſe that is now ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry neer unto burning.</p>
            <p>And every ſingle one alone in vvhom Chriſt breaths, is but a parcel of the Vine in vvhom the Divine Power dwells and reſts, even as every Branch of an Appletree is filled vvith the ſap, vvhich is the life of the vvhole Tree. Chriſt is the Divine, becauſe he grovvs and flouriſhes in the time of light; he is the Son himſelf, he is a Vine or Tree that grows by day in the heat of light, and ſo brings forth abundance of fruit to the glory of the Father. Trees that grow in the heat of the Sun, they bring forth pleaſant fruit: ſo thoſe that are Branches of this Vine, that grows in the heat and life of the one Spirit, the King of Righteouſneſs, they bring forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of the fruits of Righteouſneſs, according to the nature of the Vine they grow from: therefore the Saints are called, <hi>Children of the day,</hi> not of the night; for they ſpeak vvhat they know experimentally, and vvhat they have received feelingly from the Lord: <hi>As we have taſted, as we have felt, as we have handled, ſo we deliver unto you:</hi> and their actions and words are not ſpent at random; for they act righteouſly in the creation, among all they have to do vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and they do it from the Law of Reaſon and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which they feel ſeated vvithin them.</p>
            <p>For every one that doth ſpeak or act from the light or power of the Divine within himſelf, can give an accompt of his Words and Actions; but this is the glorying that the fleſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:172640:24"/>
part hides himſelf from: for the Law of Righteouſneſs, fleſhly <hi>Iſrael,</hi> could not behold the new Covenant, which the men of the long Robe, the Clergy-men, ſo called, are unacquainted with.</p>
            <p>For oppoſite to this Divine Chriſt, there is a night-Vine, which is the power of ſelfiſhneſs, which is a fruit of the bottomleſs pit; and it is ſpread abroad in mankinde, and every man and woman that is guided by this ſelfiſh power of darkneſs, are but Branches of the night-Vine; and this night-Vine which is fleſhly man, hath from the beginning of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, filled the whole earth vvith darkneſs, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Learning, and fleſhly Forms of Government, and ſo is become a ſpread Tree: but he is called by the Spirit of Righteouſneſs, the Thorn; the Fruit he brings forth, is ſower and bitter, and good for nothing but the dunghil; for Trees that grow alwayes in the ſhade or place of darkneſs, where the light and heat of the Sun doth not co-operate, brings forth unpleaſant fruit. Now this night-Vine, or rather Thorn-buſh, is the branchings forth of the wiſdom and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of ſelfiſh fleſh; every bud from it, is a ſharp prickle: Treacherous and covetous <hi>Judas</hi> was one Branch from that Root, and he hath riſen ſin up to a mighty great Tree: for every treacherous and covetous heart is but the buddings forth of <hi>Judas:</hi> ſo the envious Scribes and Phariſees are other Branches from the ſame Root, and theſe have riſen up into mighty ſpreading Trees; for every one that is zealous without knowledge, making a profeſſion of the ſpirit of Righteouſneſs, and yet grudging and hating the vvay of the ſpirit, are but the buddings forth of the Scribes and Phariſees that killed the juſt One, the Lord of life and glory, and wrote Hebrew, Greek and Latin over his head, to blind the world, that their learning taught them to do that act of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: and although they have now killed Chriſt after the fleſh, and by that have ſpread in every Land and Family, to hinder Chriſt from riſing, or elſe to ſuppreſs and kill him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain after he is riſen, if they could, in Sons and Daughters, whom he hath, by the manifeſtation of his light, made him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf known unto them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:172640:24"/>
So covetous <hi>Demas,</hi> proud <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> froward and churliſh <hi>Nabal,</hi> unrighteous <hi>Elymas,</hi> and ſuch like, are all the budoings forth of the Thorn-buſh, and have covered the earth with their Branches, to keep it in darkneſs, and to hide the Son of Righteouſneſs from it; and all theſe are cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred in the Clergy of this nation, or the Prieſts, which is moſt ſuitable to their taking of Tythes, which is the great ſin of Oppreſſion that many people for conſcience ſake, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, are undone in their outward Eſtates; and ſome through hard impriſonment, have loſt their bodily lives: and this great and ſad grievance is upheld by theſe mens pride, covetouſneſs, idleneſs, bitterneſs of ſpirit, deſpiſing and treading all under foot in whom the ſpirit of the Lamb ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears; which all thoſe that are born again do ſee and know this to be true, and that theſe are the ſtanding Enemies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt; their Churches, as they call them, are the Succeſſors of the Jews Synagogues, and are houſes of bon-dage. And though they have prevailed with the Magiſtrates for their Tythes, to ſettle them, yet they ſhall finde the laſt end of them will be ſad; for they are but hear-ſay Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Goſpel, they cannot ſay any thing from any Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of light they have within themſelves, but from the Writings they have from the Apoſtles, which they profeſs great love to, &amp; keep charily for their Tythes ſake: and by the one, they deceive the people of their Souls, for they preach the letter for the ſpirit; and by the other, they pick their Purſes.</p>
            <p>And this is very manifeſt by their carriage: for though thoſe Writings which they live by, were not Writings that proceeded from any Scholars according unto humane Art, but from Fiſher-men, Shepherds, Husbandmen, who ſpake and writ as the Spirit gave them utterance, from an inward Teſtimony of life; Yet now theſe learned Scholars, having got the Writings of theſe inferiour men of the world, ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by ſome, they now ſlight, and deſpiſe, and trample under their feet, men guided by the Spirit of the Lord, preſſing upon the powers of the earth, to make Laws to hold them under bondage, and that Lay-people, Tradeſmen, and ſuch
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:172640:25"/>
as are not bred in Schools, may have no liberty to ſpeak or write of the Spirit. And why ſo? Becauſe out of theſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed ones of the world, doth the Spirit riſe up more and more to clearer light, making them to ſpeak from experience, and every freſh diſcovery of the Father ſhines more glorious then the old, till at laſt the creature is made to ſee the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther face to face in his own light.</p>
            <p>But now the Scholars that come to ſpeak from the ſtrength of what they have ſtole from others, being not filled with the Holy Ghoſt, which maketh Miniſters, they have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Teſtimony of their own to uphold their Trade, but by a cuſtomary practiſe, they uphold their Trade thus, by hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding faſt the old letter, getting their livings by telling the people the meanings of thoſe Tradeſmens Words and Writings. But alas! they mightily deceive them, and corrupt their Meanings, by their multitudes of falſe Expoſitions and Interpretations: for no man knows the meaning of the Spirit of GOD, but he that hath the Spirit: and if the Father ſends forth any of theſe Tradeſmen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their Teſtimony which is in them, as in theſe dayes he ſends forth many, and theſe true labourers ſhall increaſe, maugre the Malice of Men &amp; Devils, and all thoſe falſe aſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions caſt upon them, calling them new Lights, Factious, er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronious Blaſphemers, and the like, ſhall not hurt them: for it is but that <hi>the Scriptures may be fulfilled; they ſhall ſay or ſpeak all manner of evil, falſly, against them for my ſake; and they that kill them ſhall think they do God good ſervice</hi> in it, even as thoſe that killed the <hi>Juſt One,</hi> crying, <hi>Crucifie him, crucifie Him:</hi> but all will be to no purpoſe, for the work is of the Lord, and it ſhall ſtand: The counſels of the Lord ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth place in every age, and his <hi>word is ſtabliſhed in Heaven;</hi> and when all things elſe ſhall come to nothing, then <hi>not one jot or tittle of this ſhall fail.</hi> Wicked men and Deceivers had beſt give over, for it is hard for them to <hi>kick againſt the pricks,</hi> or ſtrive againſt the ſtream: <hi>For the Lord Jehovah, at whoſe voice the mountains quake, the hills tremble; that telleth all the Stars, and calleth them all by their names; and ſaith to the proud waves of the Seas, Thus far ſhall ye go, and no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:172640:25"/>
that keepeth the devils in chains, againſt that great and terrible day, when all men ſhall be judged for the things done in their fleſh; that divided the ſeas for his children to paſs over, and drowned his enemies in the ſame waters;</hi> I ſay, this God is too great for Man to conteſt with.</p>
            <p>But what is the reaſon that the Preachers of this world, ſo called by many, are ſo bitter againſt truth in the inward parts? in words they ſpeak much for it.</p>
            <p>Becauſe the light of truth that ſprings up out of this earth, which the Scholars tread under feet, will ſhine ſo clear, as it will put out the candle of theſe wicked learned Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. Now the people are not to look for any teaching, but from the great Prophet Jeſus Chriſt, and are not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any other Ruler, but ſuch as are guided by him, this King of peace, who plants the Law of Righteouſneſs in the hearts. The hear-ſay Teachers would have the people look up to them for teaching: and verily I muſt bear my Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, that the more I look'd upon any man for teaching, the more I was wrapt into bondage and confuſion; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all the upſhot and end of the Prieſts is onely to hinder Chriſt from riſing, and to keep <hi>Jacob</hi> under, that he may be a ſervant unto the man of fleſh.</p>
            <p>So it is plain, that all that is done in the world about hear-ſay Prieſts, and their ſettled Forms of Worſhip, is no other but the ſpreadings forth of the Thorn-buſh, the fleſhly man, to hinder the worſhip of the Father in ſpirit and in truth; and all theſe ſtrict and zealous Preachers, ſo called, and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors of other mens Words and writings, and Upholders of Forms and Cuſtoms, are no other but the Scribes, Phariſees, and <hi>Judas,</hi> that ſtill purſues Chriſt in enmity. And this is the reaſon why many are ſo ignorant and cold ſpirited in the acknowledgement of the Father, becauſe the night-Vine or Branches of the Thorn-buſh are ſo mighty great and thick, that they hide the light and heat of the Sun of Righteouſneſs from it; this is the man of ſin, the Myſtery of Iniquity, that lets, and muſt let, till he be taken out of the Way. Indeed, this Thorn-buſh doth ſo prick, that none dare meddle with it, but thoſe that are well clothed with Chriſt, ſuch as have <hi>put
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:172640:26"/>
on the whole Armour of God.</hi> This Thorn-buſh or night-Vine, grows in the cold time of the night, while the Sun of Righteouſneſs is under the clouds; and the fruit it brings forth is unpleaſant, as pride, covetouſneſs, envy, ſelf-love, hypocriſie, confuſion, bondage, and all miſery, under the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of darkneſs: and all that oppreſs the holy juſt Ones, they act from this night-Vine, and are children of the night and of darkneſs.</p>
            <p>Now from hence it doth appear what proud men the Clergy are, that call themſelves Divines, when their light is but a candle, ſtolen from the Apoſtles and Prophets writings; it is not their own Light, it is but hear-ſay in them, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in their own particulars witneſs the things they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare or hold forth unto others; and therefore their pride, and covetouſneſs, doth plainly declare them to be falſe Chriſts, and falſe Prophets, and that they are but Branches of the Thorn-buſh that are full of ſharp pricks, in regard they endeavour to uphold a forced maintenance from the people, whether they will or no, and force the people to be ſilent, to hear them preach hear-ſay, what <hi>Auſtin, Gregory,</hi> and the Fathers have ſaid; and none muſt gainſay what they affirm, although never ſo falſe, upon pain of 5 <hi>l.</hi> or lye in the common Goal, and be bound to their good Behaviour; and are like to be cruſhed in their Eſtates, by the power of many wicked Magiſtrates, if they oppoſe theſe hear-ſay Prieſts that ſay and unſay; for they know not what they ſay, but ſay to darken peoples knowledge more and more! O ſad Anti-chriſtian Laws, againſt the plain Scripture, which alloweth propheſying, or ſpeaking one by one, as the Spirit giveth or maketh manifeſt, and the firſt ſhall hold his peace: doth not the ſhame of thoſe Laws and their Makers almoſt appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all men? If it do not, it will do very ſuddenly: aſſure your ſelves, you Prieſts, you muſt fall and be turned out, as <hi>Judas, Simon Magus,</hi> and the Scribes and Phariſees, that are the greateſt Enemies to Chriſt, the ſpreading power of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs: for the Lord doth not ſend hear-ſay men to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in his Vineyard, but ſuch as he firſt fills with his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine power, and then ſends them to work in his Vineyard:
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:172640:26"/>
ſo that ſtill it is but Chriſt in them, that is the One, that is ſent of the Father: for the Father ſends none but his only beloved Son in whom he is well pleaſed, who is the Law of Righteouſneſs and Peace, the ſpreading power that fills all in all. And you ſhall finde, you Prieſts that are ſo puft up, and filled with pride, and are cloathed with covetouſneſs, that ere it be long theſe poor deſpiſed ones of the world that have this Law written in their hearts, are the true Labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers that are ſent forth into the Vineyard; and you that call your ſelves Divines, and Labourers, you are but Traitors to Chriſt, and Enemies to his Spirit: you have had warnings from time to time; <hi>Many Prophets hath the Lord ſent unto you, and righteous men; but you have ſtopped your ears, and hardned your hearts at the voice of the Charmer, charm he never ſo wiſely:</hi> but the greater will be your woes and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; for you are left without excuſe; you are the men that muſt have your mouths ſtopped, not by a humane tyrannical hand of power, as you have ſtopped the mouths of Gods ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and juſt Ones, for that they abhor; for the Lord himſelf, whom you diſhonour by your hypocriſie, will ſtop your mouths with ſhame and ſorrow, when he makes you to ſee your ſelves in the ſtate of Devils, Deceivers, Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>Simon Magus, Demas</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> that are Traitors to the ſpirit and power of Righteouſneſs which is in the Saints. But if you ſay you do not aſſume the names of Divines as you write your ſelves, under which deſcription you are as bad as Diviners, Sorcerers or Deceivers, as <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am</hi> was, and as the maid that got her Maſter gain by Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, in <hi>Act.</hi> 16. 16. you hold forth letter for ſpirit, make people believe your words of hear-ſay, that it is the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and experience of the ſpirit within you; and you pick their Purſes extreamly by this Sorcery and Divination.</p>
            <p>So it appears plain that the word you call <hi>Divinity,</hi> darkens knowledge: you talk much of the Body of Divinity, and of Anatomizing Divinity: O fine Language! but when it comes to trial, it is but a husk: <hi>All is not Gold that gliſters;</hi> there is no Kernel; the words ye ſay are without life; the ſpirit that gave forth the Scripture, ye are ſtrangers unto: <hi>the

natural man underſtands not the things of God; they are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually diſcern'd:</hi> the Spirit hath filled the hearts of thoſe you deſpiſe. You go on, ſelling words for mony to the blinde people, whom you have deceived; and the Spirit is not at all in your ſervice, and your ſervice ſtinks before the Lord: your preachings, prayings, and all your Will-worſhips, with all the people joyning with you, is but an abomination in the ſight of the Lord; for you are the people that <hi>draw nigh to God with your lips, but your hearts are far from him;</hi> and are removed afar off Love; Juſtice, righteous actings, doing injury to no man, is not to be found among you, neither clean hands and a pure heart: for the alone peace of the heart lieth in ſeeing and feeling Chriſt the Divine power to riſe up and rule within; and every ſoul is in confuſion, bon-dage and ſorrrow, until he have true light and feeling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of in himſelf, as I have ſhewed and found by experience. And ſurely this may command all mouths to be ſilent, that ſpeak from hear-ſay, and yet ſaith, <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord:</hi> he lies, &amp; he diſhonoureth the Lord, whoever he is, that ſpeaketh before the Lord hath revealed himſelf in him, &amp; ſpoke to him, and put words into his mouth; &amp; he doth exceedingly wrong the ſouls of his hearers, by deceiving them; and ſo their lives, their whole actions, and their converſations are unprofitable to all men, becauſe they make them believe a Divination are Words of Knowledge ſpoke from a pure Teſtimony.</p>
            <p>Surely if the Lord had not become the Teacher of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed Ones, they had been over-ſpread with <hi>Egyptian</hi> bon-dage and darkneſs, as the Prieſts are, by whom the earth is corrupted, and over ſpread with thick darkneſs: Well, you have Prophecies and Promiſes in the Writings of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles, wait upon the Lord till you ſee the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of them within your ſelves: and leave off your much talk about words and ſyllables; for by this multitude of waſte diſcourſe people are blinded, that they neither minde the Ptophecies of Scriptures, nor wait for the fulfilling of them in themſelves: for <hi>whatſoever is written, is written for our inſtruction, upon whom the ends of the world ſhall fall.</hi>

            <p>And verily, I can truly ſay; That ſo long as I was a blinde

Profeſſor, a ſtrict goer to Church, as they call it, and a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Sermons, and never queſtioned what the Prieſt ſaid, but believed as the learned Clergy, the Church, ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved; and ſtill forgot all I heard: though I muſt ſay, The words they ſaid were like a pleaſant ſong in my ears, whilſt I heard them. And this I know is the beſt condition of all your zealous Profeſſors, this is all they can get from you; for you are in bondage and confuſion; and Ignorance is the Mother of your Devotion: for your lives are in the fleſh, you do not ſavour the things that are of the Spirit, and ſo you are not of God. Whilſt I was ſuch a Profeſſor, I was counted by ſome Prieſts and others, a good Chriſtian, and a godly Man, though all that was in me, was but zealous Ignorance, and led me on in the heighth of the deceitful Nature. But ſince it hath pleaſed the Father to reveal his Son in me, and hath cauſed me to ſpeak what I know from an inward princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of light and power of life within; Now the ſame Prieſts, and Profeſſors whom they have deceived, my former Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, begin to be affraid of me, and call me an erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Man, a dangerous man; and look upon me as upon a man of another world; and in that, they are not miſtaken: for <hi>our Converſation is in heaven; and our delight on earth is in the Saints, and in thoſe excellent Ones,</hi> that excels in vertue. For my part, I can truly ſay, from the goodneſs of the Lord, who is worthy of everlaſting praiſes, to be acknowledged from me, that am as a brand ſnatch'd out of the fire, and kept from burning, by the goodneſs and loving kindneſs of the Lord, That <hi>my portion is fallen to me in a goodly heritage; the Lord is my portion; I have the Lord, I have enough.</hi> I look upon them with the eye of pity and love, ſeeing them as yet to live under the ſpirit of Deluſion, and power of Darkneſs; the god of this world having blinded their eyes, that they cannot ſee the way to the Kingdom: and therefore I think it my Duty to wait upon the great Reſtorer of all things, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til he manifeſt or raiſe in them the manifeſtation of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of that light that he hath placed in their ſouls, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them to profit withal, and then that ruling in them, will makes us become one again, and then we ſhall not be divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

Chriſt, which is given them to profit withal; and if they fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that light, it will bring them out of every evil way: for it is that pure thing in man, that never did conſent to ſin, nor never will, but doth check and reprove for evil thoughts, and vain luſts and deſires, which this light judgeth down; for Chriſt hath thus enlightned every man that cometh into the world: now till the meaſure of this light is manifeſted in you, ſo as totally to deſtroy the works of the Devil, for to that end Chriſt came, even to deſtroy ſin; I bear my Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from the Lords Spirit, You are ſtrangers from the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and Aliens from the Commonwealth of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and are <hi>without God in the world:</hi> and how are you fit to teach another, that know not your own Guide, that is, the Lord from heaven? for know you not that the Kingdom of heaven is within you? you Diſciples, you little Ones, that are born again, <hi>not of corruptible ſeed, but of incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the word that abideth for ever, Chriſt in you, the hope of glory: for know you not that Chriſt is in you, except ye be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probates?</hi> ſo your deceipt is to drive a Trade in the world, to deceive ſouls, to keep people from knowing the true Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher: for if they ſhould once know one within them, to lead them whither they in their corrrupt wills would not go, and ſhould give way to obey that holy Voice, for it is the Voice of Chriſt, then they would not give their money for that which profiteth not, and that which is not bread; for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that eateth the bread that I ſhall give him, ſhall live for ever: for my fleſh is meat indeed:</hi> and, <hi>he that believeth in me, out of his belly ſhall flow rivers of living water:</hi> Now you do eſteem men contrary minded, as Hereticks; the Juſt One, Chriſt, was accuſed for a perverter of the people, by the Jews, <hi>Luk. 23. 14.

            <p>Now is the day of the Lords mighty power appearing, and his people need not go to the Prieſts for help, Jer. 31. 34. <hi>After thoſe days, ſaith the Lord God, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts, and will be their God, and they ſhall be my people; and they ſhall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord: for they ſhall all know me, from the leaſt of them to the greateſt of them; for I will forgive their iniquities ſaith the Lord, and remember their ſins no more. Thus ſaith the Lord which giveth the Sun for a light by day, and the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Moon and Stars for a light by night, which divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth the ſea, when the waves thereof roar, the Lord of Hosts is his name.</hi> Now is it fit to hearken to your preaching, as you call it, by Arguments and expoſitions, putting a meaning up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on other mens words, as you Prieſts do, telling ſtories by hear-ſay of what you have read out of the works of thoſe, it is like, as much out of the power and life of God as your

            <p>Well, you muſt all be ſlighted; your preaching ſtinks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Father, and he will draw his people out of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and leave you naked and bare, and your ſhame ſhall be made manifeſt to all men. For indeed, I bear my Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony from the Lord, That you are a moſt wicked Generation of men: for you are teaching people, buſying their heads what hath been done in the time of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Prophets and Apoſtles times, and in the Son of Mans time in the fleſh, Jeſus, the Anointed; but you do not, nor cannot teach them, becauſe you are ſtrangers to it, to wait upon the Lord, to find light from the ſpirit of Righteouſneſs, which is to ariſe from the meaſure of the light of Chriſt in every one, and his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in and upon the heart. Now all the Learning and Arts in the world, is but to ſpeak methodically of what hath been, what is, and conjecture what ſhall be: all which is uncertain. Now he that ſpeaks within, <hi>as we have felt, as we have taſted, as we have handled, ſo we deliver unto you;</hi> I ſay, theſe muſt know what they ſay, and know who they worſhip: and whereas ſome of you call ſilent meetings a dumb Idol, when the people of the Lord are waiting on him, for the fulfilling of thoſe Prophecies promiſed unto them; You ſhew your blindneſs: for it is and ſhall be the portion of the ſons and daughters of the Lord to wait in ſilence with their eyes look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upwards, waiting to be taught onely by Chriſt, the great Prophet, before whom all fleſh ſhall be made ſilent.</p>
            <p>And therefore ceaſe your teachings, and your prayers, as you call them: for they are an abomination to the Lord, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til you finde this true Teacher Chriſt in you, opening your hearts to hear his voice: for whoever doth ſpeak, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:172640:32"/>
the Lord in a pure Language, that is, from himſelf, ſhall bear his ſhame, whoever he be.</p>
            <p>For the time is come that none ſhall need anything to teach him the way to <hi>Sion,</hi> but an humble quiet heart, to wait on the Lord, till he manifeſt himſelf unto them: for the Lord is a great King, and worthy to be waited upon; and his Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny within, fills the ſoul with joy and ſinging; ſuch joy as the world knoweth not of, and ſuch joy as men and devils cannot take from them, by which his holy Ones have experience of his goodneſs, that he is the <hi>Roſe of Sharon, the choiceſt among the ſons, altogether lovely;</hi> whoſe love is better then wine, his fruits are ſweet unto the taſte; whoſe voyce is ſweet, and his countenance altogether comely; and the ſouls of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved ones delighteth in him: and by this experience of him, he gives power unto them to ſpeak forth thoſe experiences unto others, and then they ſpeak to the rejoycing of one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and to the praiſe of Him that declares Himſelf in them.</p>
            <p>And therefore thou, whoever thou art, that ſpeakeſt thy ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations, ſtudies of thy own brain, thoughts, and makes thy ſelf a Teacher of others, and the voice of the Lord hath not appeared to thee, and the anointing from the holy Spirit hath not come down upon thee, thou ſhalt be judged for thy unrighteouſneſs, becauſe thou ſeekeſt to honor fleſh, for thou doſt not honour the Lord: for the anointing that cometh to teach all things, creates new heaven, and new earth, wherein dwelleth Righteouſneſs; for they ſhall be filled with the fulneſs of Chriſt, who is the ſpreading power that filleth all in all; every Member of his Body, being a ſtar ſhining forth of him; or rather, a body in and out of whom he ſhines; for he is the power that fills all, <hi>Rom. 8. 23. We that have the firſt fruits of the Spirit, even we, groan within our ſelves, waiting for the adoption, to wit, the redemption of our bodies; and the Spirit it ſelf maketh interceſſion for us, with groanings which cannot be uttered: and he that ſearcheth the heart, knoweth what the minde of the Spirit is; becauſe he maketh interceſſion for the Saints, according to the will of God:</hi> For he makes all new by himſelf and for himſelf; and this is called the holy

But Iſrael which followed after the Law of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, hath not attained to the Law of Righteouſneſs; for they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the works of the Law;</hi> the reaſon they ſtumbled at that ſtumbling Stone which the Builders refuſed, but now is become the corner-Stone, the Rock of Ages: as it is written, <hi>Behold, I lay in Sion a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling ſtone, and a Rock of offence, and whoſoever believeth on him ſhall not be aſhamed: The Word is nigh thee, even in thy heart and in thy mouth, that is, the word of faith which we preach,</hi> Rom. 10. 8.

            </argument>
            <p>
               <hi>THere is no man</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that putteth his hand to the Plough, and looketh back, that is apt for the kingdom of God.</hi> Now doth not moſt Profeſſors look back? do they do the works God, or are they not doing the works of the devil? is not wrath, anger, backbiting, whiſpering, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving, over-reaching in their bargains, killing, is not theſe fruits to be found amongſt all Profeſſors? and therefore it is high time for them to repent, that they may do their firſt works: for the time once was, that they had Zeal, and Love, and Gentleneſs and Temperance, and were in the Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a little kept: but now they are come into the perſecuting
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:172640:34"/>
nature, into the deſtroying nature, the devouring nature, the dogs nature; and are out of the Lambs nature: for the fruits of Faith, are Love, Goodneſs, Gentleneſs, Meekneſs, Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, Brotherly kindneſs, Charity, Bowels of compaſſion, Holineſs and Righteouſneſs; <hi>Againſt ſuch</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) there is no Law: For they that are Chriſts, have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now amongſt thoſe tender Lambs of Chriſt, thoſe Babes that are born again, thoſe Plants of the Lords right Hand, Trees of his own planting that are full of ſap, the Cedars of Lebanon; I mean thoſe that are by the wicked of the earth, the men of this world, in ſcorn called <hi>Quakers,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe is crept in wicked Deceivers, ungodly men, and ungodly Women, even as <hi>Judas</hi> crept in amongſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, ſuch who think that gain is godlineſs, ſuch who follow Chriſt for the Loaves, ſuch as think they can ſerve two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, God and Mammon, Chriſt and Riches, Chriſt and Luſts, Chriſt and the World, Chriſt and Antichriſt; ſuch who teach that Doctrine of Devils, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of, denying to marry, and to abſtain from meats, ſuch who turn the Grace of God in them into wantonneſs, Truce breakers, Breakers of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venants, pretending they were married in their carnal eſtate; and they were never moved of the Lord, and therefore they may leave their husbands, and leave their wives; and that ſpirit theſe are guided by, is of Satan, and ſo will lead them to take others, as their blind <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> leads them: for by nothing but Imagination, Luſt and Fancie, are ſuch led. And ſuch leads away ſilly women, that are captivated by Satan, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with divers luſts and pleaſures, that are alwayes learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers are led to neglect their Families and Relations, to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their Children; contrary to that Doctrine of <hi>Paul,</hi> that ſaith, <hi>A man is worſe then an Infidel that doth not provide for his Family,</hi> meaning his outward Family: For, let every man wait on his calling; and God hath appointed that the creation ſhall be managed, that man may be Lord of all the creatures: and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It is a more happier thing to give then to receive:</hi> and the Apoſtle commandeth to <hi>lay up, that
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:172640:34"/>
there may be a distribution amongſt the Saints:</hi> and how can he lay up that is idle, and runs to and fro, waſting his time in idleneſs, and conſuming his pretious time, whilſt his wife and children wants at home? and ſo this ſpirit rents and tears the affections of men from their wives, and women from their husbands, and children from their parents; and this that brings into a diſ-uniting, is not the Spirit of the Lord: for the Spirit of the Lord brings into Union: for it ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the whole world at laſt, that they ſhall be all of one heart, and of one ſpirit; and the one alone ſpirit of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs ſhall fill all in all: And this cannot be that ſpirit that rents and makes diviſions; but this ſpirit of Righteouſneſs teacheth the man to know his own wife, and love her, as Chriſt did the Church; and it teacheth the woman to know and love her own husband; and the man and woman ſo taught, live like Turtle Doves. And ſo the unbelieving woman cometh to be ſanctified by the believing man; &amp; the unbelieving man by the believing woman; and here the good vertuous Wife cometh to be found, that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaketh of, whoſe <hi>price is above pearls, and ſhe doth him good and not evil all his days:</hi> and is not as the wicked woman, that is termed by him, <hi>a whoriſh woman, that is rottenneſs to her husbands bones.</hi> And Others there are, that are very looſe in their carriage, and deny the Reſurrection of the Body, contrary to the Doctrine of the Apoſtle, ſaying, The Reſurrection is paſt already, and ſuch was in his time, that had overthrown the faith of ſome: now theſe people are in diſtraction, and the Spirit of the Lord leades into Unity, Love, and Peace, and out of all diſturbance; and the Lord is the portion of his people for ever, and they that ſtay themſelves upon God, are kept in perfect peace: and the Spirit of God is infallible: they that are guided by that, cannot erre; and theſe do erre, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Scriptures, and ſo are led into the diſtraction which cauſeth diſturbance; and this is, by the cunningneſs of <hi>Satan,</hi> who lieth in wait to deceive, and this ſimple people are led captive by him, to do his will at his pleaſure.</p>
            <p>And therefore dear Friends, take heed how you hear, and whom you hear; and be not blinded by thoſe that lie cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly in wait, to deceive you: for all that is to be known
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:172640:35"/>
of God, is made manifeſt in man: and this is all the Lord thy God requireth of thee, To do juſtly, love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God: for Holineſs becometh the Houſe of the Lord for ever. And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>He that hath my commandments and keepeth them, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> And therefore do not think the Name or the Profeſſion of a thing will ſerve the turn; it is coming into the Life and Power of the thing that is expected from the Lord: they that cry in that day, We have eat and drunk in thy preſence, and thou haſt taught in our ſtreets; all that will not do: <hi>Depart from me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: the reaſon why, is ſhewed by him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were <hi>Workers of iniquity.</hi> So there is no privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge for a people, be they never ſo high in Gods favour, yet if they ſin againſt him, they muſt know, the wrath of God is againſt them: for if a righteous man turn from his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and do that which is evil, he ſhall die for the evil, and <hi>I will remember his righteouſneſs</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>no more.</hi> The people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were a peculiar people, the Lord had mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted his love in abundance to them, he fed them with An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels food, and led them in the Wilderneſs, that their cloaths waxed not old; and he made the rock guſh out waters, and gave them Quails, the luſts of their own hearts. But they died in judgement; whilſt the meat was in their mouthes, the wrath of God came down upon them, and Gods Soul came to be angry with them, even ſo much that the Lord ſaid, <hi>My ſoul ſhall be avenged on this Generation. David,</hi> a man after Gods own heart, yet for ſinning, was forc'd to go with broken bones, and his Ioines were filled with a ſore Diſeaſe, and he went groaning all the day long. <hi>Moſes</hi> for ſtriking the Rock twice, did not enter the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not thou think, whoever thou art, and let thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion be what it will: for if thou ſinneſt againſt God, thou muſt be puniſhed by him. And know this, That the end of all teaching, and ſpeaking, and writing, is to be brought to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The end of all, ſaith <hi>Solomon,</hi> is to fear God, and keep his Commandments: This is the whole Duty of Man.</p>
            <p>And therefore be as thou ſeemeſt to be, or ſeem to be as thou art: For it is onely the pure in heart ſhall ſee God; and the meek ſhall inherit the earth, and dwell therein for ever.</p>

God, as ſin is made known unto thee, by the light of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Spirit of Righteouſneſs which is in thee, and there is placed, to make known ſin and evil unto thee, and is there placed in thy heart, to raiſe thy immortal ſoul, by the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſeed of the word, which is, Chriſt in thee, that thou mayſt live unto him that hath called thee out of Darkneſs into his marvelous light, that we might not henceforth live unto our ſelves, but unto him; and therefore living unto him, is to be holy as he was holy, and pure as he was pure: and ſo the Life of the Saints is to be a Life of purity, and it is the pure in heart that ſee him; and ſo it is not as <hi>Roger Crabb</hi> ſurmiſeth, and <hi>William Smith,</hi> and <hi>John Dunck,</hi> and others, in wearing hair or not hair: for if they will believe the Hiſtory of <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus,</hi> they may finde that Chriſt wore his Hair very long, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving about his Shoulders; and the Scriptures of Truth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention, that he wore it according to the manner of the Nazarites, who had no Razor come upon their heads: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it in dirty hands &amp; faces, as they fondly do ſurmiſe; but it lieth in the hidden man of the heart, in a meek and quiet ſpirit, which is a thing of God, much ſet by: neither is it in ſtraw Hats, or ſuch fond conceits; for they cannot be made without hands, no more then woollen ones. But the Reader may take notice, that this people being departed from the living preſence of the Lord God, where Life, and Peace, and Reſt is to be dwelt in; they wander up and down, ſeeking Reſt, and finde none: for the Peace is not in eating or drinking, but in Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt. It is not then in denying the lawful uſe of the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Whatſoever is ſold in the ſhambles, that eat, making no ſcruple for conſcience-ſake.</hi> So then it is clear, that men may lawfully eat all creatures, as well as herbs, or what groweth naturally: <hi>And every creature of God is good</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) and nothing ought to be refuſed, if it be received with praiſe and thanks giving:</hi> and, <hi>it is not that</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that goeth into the man, that doth defile the man; but that which cometh out: For out of the heart</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>proceedeth adultery, fornication, murder, and the like:</hi> So it is the evil heart being corrupted, that is the cauſe of the man
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:172640:36"/>
being defiled, and it is not the denying of meats wherein Religion ſtands: for they may ſee that Chriſt fed five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men with five Loaves and two Fiſhes, and commanded the Fragments to be taken up, that nothing might be left; and he turned water into wine: if he had not allowed the uſe of it, he would not have made it; but it was to be drunk. And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>If any of you have a ſon ſhall ask bread, will he give him a ſtone? or if he ſhall ask a fiſh, will he give him a ſerpent?</hi> ſo he clearly owneth the eating of thoſe creatures. And if they, or any led by their fond deceitful ſpirit, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Reſurrection of the Body of Chriſt out of the grave, let them read <hi>Luk.</hi> 26. verſ. 37. and ſo forward: <hi>But they were terrified and affrighted, and ſuppoſed that they had ſeen a ſpirit: and he ſaid unto them, Why are you troubled, and why do thoughts ariſe in your hearts? Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I my ſelf; handle me, and ſee: for a Spirit hath not fleſh and bones, as you ſee me have. And when he had thus ſpoken, he ſhewed them his hands and his feet. And while they yet believed not, for joy, and wondered, he ſaid unto them, Have ye here any meat? and they gave him a piece of broyled fiſh, and a honey-comb; and he took it, and did eat before them: and he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, Theſe are the words which I ſpake unto you, while I was yet with you, that all things muſt be fulfilled which were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Law of Moſes, and in the Prophets, and in the Pſalmes, concerning me. Then opened he their underſtandings, that they might underſtand the Scriptures.</hi> Act. 1. verſ. 9. and ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: <hi>And when he had ſpoken theſe things, while they beheld, he was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their ſight; and while they looked ſtedfaſtly towards heaven, as he went up, behold, two men ſtood by them in white apparel, which ſaid, Ye men of Galilee, why ſtand ye gazing up into heaven? this ſame Jeſus which is taken up from you into heaven, ſhall ſo come in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as you have ſeen him go into heaven.</hi>

Nevertheleſs, if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous ſin not, and he doth not ſin, he ſhall ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly live: the ſoul that ſinneth ſhall die: but if a man be juſt, and do that which is lawful and right, and hath not eaten up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the mountains, neither hath lift up his eyes to the idols of the houſe of Iſrael, neither hath defiled his neighbours wife, neither hath come neer to menſtruous women, and hath not oppreſſed any, but hath reſtored to the debtor his pledge; hath ſpoiled none by violence, hath given his bread to the hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, and hath covered the naked with a garment; he that hath not given forth upon uſury, neither hath taken any increaſe, that hath with-drawn his hand from iniquity, hath executed true judgement between man and man; hath walked in my ſtatutes, and kept my judgements, to deal truly; he is juſt, he ſhall ſurely live, ſaith the Lord God. And they that be wiſe ſhall ſhine as the ſtars in the firmament, for ever and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver: and they that turn many to righteouſneſs, as the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the firmament. And in that day will I make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant for them with the beaſts of the field, &amp; with the fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground; and I will break the bow, and the ſword, and the battel out of the earth, and will make them dwell ſafely; and I will betroth thee unto my ſelf in righteouſneſs for ever; yea, I will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth thee unto my ſelf in righteouſneſs, and in judgement, and in loving kindneſs, and in mercy: I will betroth thee unto my ſelf in faithfulneſs; and thou ſhalt know the Lord. The Lord alſo ſhall roar out of Sion, and utter his voice from Jeruſalem: and the heavens and the earth ſhall ſhake: but the Lord will be the hope of his people, &amp; the ſtrength of the children of Iſrael. Then ſhall Jeruſalem be holy, and there ſhall no ſtranger paſs through her any more: For thus ſaith the Lord unto the houſe of Iſrael, Seek ye me, and ye ſhall live. But upon mount Sion ſhall be deliverance, and there ſhall be holineſs; and the houſe of Jacob ſhall poſſeſs their poſſeſſions. They that obſerve lying vanities, forſake their own mercy. But I will ſacrifice to thee with the voice of thankſgiving; I will pay that that I have vowed: ſalvation is of
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:172640:40"/>
the Lord. Thus ſaith the Lord, concerning the prophets that make my people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry peace; and he that putteth not into their mouths, they ever prepare war againſt him. <hi>But truly, I am full of power, by the Spirit of the Lord, and of judgement, and of might, to</hi> declare unto Jacob his tranſgreſſions, and to Iſrael his ſin. Hear this, ye heads of the houſe of Jacob, and princes of the houſe of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, that abhor all judgement, and pervert all equity; they build up Sion with blood, and Jeruſalem with iniquity; the heads thereof judge for reward, and the prieſts thereof teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet will they lean upon the Lord, and ſay, Is not the Lord amongſt us? no evil can come upon us. Therefore ſhall Zion for your ſakes be plowed as a Field, and Jeruſalem ſhall become heaps, and the Mountains of the houſe as the high places of the Foreſts. The Lord is of purer eyes then to behold evil, and cannot behold iniquity.</p>
            <p>When the Lords appearance cometh upon the ſoul, then he cuts away all Idols, and they ſhall be no more remembred: the appearance of the Lord giveth ſight to the blind: Chriſt Jeſus enlightneth every man that cometh into the world; and that is Chriſt the Son of the moſt High, that checketh for evil in every one, and that is the true Teacher. Follow that: it will bring thee out of all evil; for it leadeth unto perfect peace. Ye ſhall not ſay, <hi>Lo here is Chriſt, or lo he is there: but the Word is nigh thee, even in thy heart, and in thy mouth:</hi> and this true Teacher, will keep thee from the very appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of evil. The Lord Jeſus promiſed the Comforter ſhould come after his departure; and <hi>Peter</hi> received it: for he being full of the Holy Ghoſt, there was three thouſand added by his Miniſtry at once: and the Apoſtles, when-they had prayed, the place was ſhaken where they were aſſembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Ghoſt, and they ſpake the Word of God with boldneſs. Now Chriſt is the Bread of Life: <hi>And he that eateth the bread that I ſhall give him,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ſhall never hunger: and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth in me,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>hath everlaſting life: and he that
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:172640:40"/>
eateth the bread that I ſhall give him, ſhall live for ever. And thoſe that are riſen with Chriſt, ſet their affections on the things above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God; and they do not minde earthly things: for as they have born the Image of the earthly Adam, which is ſin unto death; ſo they muſt bear the Image of the heavenly, which is obedience unto righteouſneſs: the end</hi> whereof, through his mercy that enableth them to bear it, <hi>is everlaſting life and ſalvation:</hi> and, <hi>he that is born of God, ſinneth not, becauſe he is born of God;</hi> neither can he ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is born of God: <hi>for he that committeth ſin, is of the devil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now conſider theſe ſayings, and ponder them in your minds; for where the Lord cometh, his preſence is very dreadful and terrible; and he deſtroyeth all Graven Images, and grindeth them to duſt; he maketh that heart deny him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and take up his Croſs dayly, and follow him. When a ſtronger then the ſtrong man armed cometh, he deſtroyeth his ſtrong holds, and divideth the ſpoils, and maketh the heart clean: <hi>A new heart,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>will I give thee, and a new ſpirit will I put into thee, and I will lead thee, and be thy ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting reward and ſtrength to ſupport thee: for I dwell in the humble, and delight to give life to my contrite ones: for with the holy, wilt thou be holy; and with the contrite and pure, will I be pure, ſaith the Lord. Now by thy words, thou ſhalt be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; and by thy words condemned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this is from the true Lover of all your ſouls, the ſeed of God in you, that groaneth after the deliverance of it, may come forth from the ſtate of bondage, and corruption, and thraldom, where it is kept, that it may come to the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liberty of the Sons of God Almighty, the moſt high, who with continual praiſes with one heart, and in oneneſs of ſpirit ſing continual Praiſes and Hallelujahs to Him that liveth for ever and ever, who alone is worthy of all everlaſting praiſes from his own, henceforth and for ever.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall ſhew the ſigns, marks and characters of good Magiſtrates, as the Lord giveth of them, as I find in Scripture: and by the manifeſtation of his Spirit within me, I know it is the Lords deſire, that Judges and all Magiſtrates ſhould be
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:172640:41"/>
ſuch as feareth the Lord and hateth covetouſneſs, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Righteouſneſs, that judgement and juſtice may run down like a mighty ſtream, and Rivers of waters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Moſes</hi> was a good Magiſtrate: he executed the Law with Juſtice upon all, without reſpect of perſons, or gifts, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, according to the command of the Lord, who was the Lawgiver: <hi>For the Law came by Moſes, but Grace by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Deborah</hi> was a good Magiſtrate, and the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came up to her for judgement; and ſhe judged <hi>Iſrael</hi> at that time, and the Lord was with her, and made her lead away the Captives, and lead them into Captivity that oppreſſed his people: for ſhe was juſt before him; and the Stars from Heaven fought in their courſes for her, againſt the enemies of truth, and the river <hi>Kiſhon</hi> ſwept them away: and the Land had reſt forty years: and the Lord cauſed the Mighty and the Nobles to be in ſubjection unto her, and the Lord went before her, and the earth trembled, and the heavens dropped, the clouds dropped water.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gideon</hi> was a good Magiſtrate, and the Angel of the Lord appeared unto him, and ſaid, <hi>The Lord is with thee, thou migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty man of valour; go in this thy might, and thou ſhalt ſave Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael.</hi> And the Lord ſaid unto him, <hi>I will be with thee.</hi> And the Lord ſaid unto him, <hi>Peace be unto thee; thou ſhalt not dye: and the Spirit of the Lord came upon Gideon; and Gideon did as the Lord had commanded him. And Gideon ſaid, That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I nor my Son ſhall rule over you. And the Land had reſt forty years in the days of Gideon</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Solomon</hi> was a good Magiſtrate, and God ſaid unto him, <hi>Becauſe thou askedſt this thing, and haſt not asked the life of thy enemies, nor long life for thy ſelf, neither riches for thy ſelf, but haſt asked for thy ſelf underſtanding to diſcern Judgement; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I have done according to thy words: lo, I have given thee a wiſe and an underſtanding heart, ſo that there was none like thee before thee, neither after thee ſhall ariſe any like unto thee; and I have given thee that which thou haſt not asked, both riches and honour; ſo that there ſhall not be any like unto thee, amongſt the kings all thy dayes.</hi> And <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaid, His meditation was
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:172640:41"/>
ſtayed on the Lord all the day long, and his meditation was of his goodneſs, kept in the Lords fear: <hi>And Solomonraigned over all Iſrael forty years.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Aſa</hi> was a good Magiſtrate: he was perfect before the Lord, although the high places were not taken away in his time: he reigned one and forty years, and the people had much comfort by him, &amp; made ſore lamentation for his death: for they, by his appointment, entered into a ſolemn League and Covenant, <hi>That whoſoever would not ſeek the Lord God of Iſrael, ſhould be put to death, whether ſmall or great, whether man or woman: and all Judah rejoyced at the oath: for they had ſworn with all their hearts, and ſought him with their whole deſires, and he was found of them; and the Lord gave them reſt round about:</hi> And <hi>Aſa</hi> reigned in peace ſeven and thirty years.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was a good Magiſtrate; and he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, according to all that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> his father had done, and wrought that which was right and truth in the ſight of the Lord, according to all that <hi>David</hi> his father had done; and wrought that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, and he did it with all his heart, in ſeeking the Commandments of his God, and proſpered in the work.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Joſiah</hi> was a good Magiſtrate; and he did that which was right in the ſight of the Lord, and walked in the wayes of <hi>David</hi> his father, and did not decline from the right hand, nor the left: and the people ſorely lamented his death: for all <hi>Judah</hi> mourned for him, and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his death: and he reigned one and thirty years.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of a good Biſhop, that <hi>he muſt be no ſtriker, blameleſs, the ſteward of the Lord, not ſoon angry, not given to filthy lucre, nor wine, but a lover of hoſpitality, a lover of good men, ſober, juſt, holy, temperate, holding faſt the faithful word:</hi> and he ſheweth the reaſon, <hi>That he may be able by ſound do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine to convince gain-ſayers:</hi> he exhorts that prayers and ſupplications may be made for kings, and all in authority; to what end, he ſheweth; to this end, That we may live peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able lives in all godlineſs and honeſty: for this is good and acceptable in God our Saviour: and he ſaith, <hi>The Magiſtrate
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:172640:42"/>
beareth not the ſword ſor nought; It is for the puniſhment of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that Magiſtrate whoſe heart is not touched with the true fear of the Lord, and that ſeed of true faith that is as ſmall as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, hath got the pre-eminence, and is chief in his ſoul, and Chriſt Jeſus is ſet up in his ſoul, in him on the throne, that he hath the whole heart, and the whole man is in his dominion, that can truly ſay, by bearing Teſtimony to the witneſs of God in him, <hi>That to him to live is Christ, and to die is gain;</hi> unleſs the Magiſtrate be ſuch, he is not Chriſts Magiſtrate: for thoſe that are Chriſts, have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the fleſh, with the affections and luſts; and no drunkard, whoremaſter, ſwearer, proud, ambitious, ſelf-ſeeker, lover of pleaſures more then lover of God, having a form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but denying the power thereof, no ſuch can be ſaid to be of God, and ſo are not to have that double honour which is due to Magiſtrates that do truly rule in his fear. And this diſcovers plainly how ſhort thoſe Judges and Juſtices come of being godly Magiſtrates, that ſuffer and conſent to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoning of juſt and righteous ones, whom the Lord eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth as the Apple of his eye; and thoſe that touch them to their hurt, will one day find it, that the Lord eſteemeth them as his Jewels: and yet how is the Goals filled with them through the Nation? and ſome have periſhed to death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they cannot conſent, for conſcience-ſake, to pay Tythes, ſeeing them to be a great and abominable Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>I could wiſh that Judges and all Magiſtrates would regard their Oathes, to do equal Adminiſtration of Juſtice to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man alike, to have no mans Cauſe in reſpect of perſon, but rightly to judge for the Poor as well as the Rich, and let the merits of the Cauſe carry it; minding the words of <hi>Jehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat:</hi> for he ſaid to the Judges, <hi>Take heed what you do: for ye judge not for man, but for the Lord: wherefore let the fear of the Lord be upon you: for there is no iniquity with the Lord our God, nor taking of Gifts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let them that are contrary minded, remember the ends of <hi>Empſon</hi> and <hi>Dudly,</hi> and mind the proceedings of <hi>Henry</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:172640:42"/>
the Third, in the five and thirtieth year of his reigne, againſt <hi>Henry de Bath,</hi> one of the Judges then. And the ſixteenth year of <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, there being a great complaint of the ill Adminiſtration of Juſtice by the Judges; whereupon the then Parliament, upon due examination, and proofs of their Bribery and Extortion, together with their injuſtice done to the people, were fined to pay to the King, as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth: <hi>Ralph Hengham,</hi> chief Juſtice of the Upper Bench, 7000 Marks; <hi>John Lineton,</hi> chief Juſtice of the Lower Bench, 3000 Marks; <hi>William Brompton</hi> Juſtice, 6000 Marks; <hi>Solomon Rocheſter,</hi> 4000 Marks; <hi>Thomas Lodington,</hi> 2000 Marks; <hi>Walter Hopton,</hi> 2000 Marks; <hi>Richard Boyland,</hi> 4000 Marks; <hi>William Sham,</hi> 3000 Marks; <hi>Robert Litbury,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Rolls, 1000 Marks; <hi>Roger Lieſter,</hi> 1000 Marks; <hi>Henry Bray,</hi> Eſcheter, and Judge for the Jews, 1000 Marks; <hi>Adam Streton,</hi> chief Baron of the Exchequer, was fined 34000 Marks; and <hi>Thomas Wayland,</hi> being found the greateſt Delinquent, for Bribery and Extortion, and being of the greateſt ſubſtance had all his Eſtate, real and perſonal, taken from him to the Kings uſe: and this great Act of Juſtice was highly pleaſing to the people, and brough<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> much honour to the King, as well as Treaſure into his Coffers: And one <hi>Bell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knap</hi> and <hi>Triſillian,</hi> being both chief Juſtices, were executed for injuſtice. In the year forty one, Articles were exhibited againſt <hi>John Bramſton</hi> chief Juſtice, <hi>Robert Barkly, Francis Crawly, Humphry Davenport, Richard Weston, Thomas Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor,</hi> being Juſtices of both the Benches, and Barons of the Exchequer; and as I take it, they were degraded for injuſtice done the people. It is ſaid of that great Tyrant <hi>Nero,</hi> That he could not indure an unjuſt Judge: for one being convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before him for injuſtice, he cauſed him to be flea'd alive, and his skin to be nailed to the Judgement-Seat, that whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver came on that Seat, might have that act of Juſtice freſh in his memory.</p>
            <p>Thou art inexcuſable, O man, whoever thou art, that judgeſt another: for wherein thou judgeſt another, thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demneſt thy ſelf, if thou doſt the ſame things: and thinkeſt thou to eſcape the judgement of Cod?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:172640:43"/>
Now it were a good thing for the people of <hi>England,</hi> that the chief Magiſtrates with their Council, would erect a Court of Juſtice, where every man, by their Proclamation, might once every quarter of a year, appeal to the ſaid Court, for relief againſt any injury done them by Judges, Juſtices, or any Officers of the Commonwealth in private or in publick, done to their detriment. This would be a high Act of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice from the Counſellors, Magiſtrates or Rulers, who ſhould preſerve Juſtice in the Land: and it would be very ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to all the people; and this would make men follow the Command of Chriſt in time, <hi>To do unto all men, as they would have all men do unto them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all theſe Texts of Scripture before-rehearſed, it is plainly ſhewed by the holy Ghoſt, the marks of true Teachers and falſe; the marks of hireling ſhepherds, and ſuch as fleece the Flock; and ſuch as are of Chriſt, and are truly Miniſters of Chriſt, and have the Spirit of Chriſt, God having revealed himſelf in them, they do miniſter food in due ſeaſon; and they do feed the Flock of Chriſt, over which the holy Ghoſt hath made them Overſeers; and they do turn people unto God, unto the light that is ſingle, that knoweth the deep and hidden things of God: for the Father that dwelleth in them, ſheweth them all things; and they have the firſt Fruits of the Spirit, and God is in them of a truth, and they and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are one; and they do abide in the Vine, and in him they bring forth much Fruit, to the glory of God the Father: and theſe Fruits of the holy Ghoſt are to be found dwelling in them, as Love, Joy, Meekneſs, Patience, Temperance, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Kindneſs, Bowels of Mercy, Humbleneſs of Minde, Holineſs and Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>And the falſe Teachers appear plainly by their Fruits, to be the Prieſts that do receive Tythes: for they ſeek gain from their Quarters; they fleece the Flock, and do not feed them; they ſpeak a Divination of their own brain; they are in the number of thoſe that ſteal the word from their neighbour, and cry, <hi>The Lord ſaith,</hi> when the Lord never ſpake unto them: they do not at all profit the people: for they that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean, are unclean; they that were filthy, are filthy ſtill; and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:172640:43"/>
Drunkards are Drunkards ſtill: they are not ſent of God; for if they were, they would have turned people from the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of their doings, and they ſhould have learned to do well. <hi>By their fruits</hi> (Chriſt ſaith) <hi>they ſhall be known: for men do not gather figs of thorns, nor grapes of thistles: but every good tree bringeth forth good fruit:</hi> and by their covetous fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy lives they deſtroy the hearty profeſſions of their hearers, who are much led by example and practice of their Teachers; and herein they are partakers of other mens ſins, and ſo muſt partake with them of their plagues; and the blind doth lead the blind, and they muſt fall into the ditch: for they that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not witneſs in their own particulars, that the Spirit of the Lord in them, is raiſed, and hath the whole ſeat of the ſoul in his dominion and power, and the ſeed of God is raiſed in him, and there is a continual watch kept to deſtroy ſin in its firſt motion, and ſo it is not yeilded to, but is laid all upon the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter: unleſs a man be brought to this, he is not a fit perſon to teach others: for Chriſt commandeth his Diſciples to be <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as their Father which is in heaven is perfect; and to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in all manner of converſation: for without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord:</hi> and, <hi>he that is in Chriſt, ought ſo to walk as Chriſt hath walked, who did no ſin, neither was there guile found in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am ſure the Prieſts dare not ſay they are in Chriſt, or that he hath revealed himſelf in them, or that the holy Ghoſt is come down upon them: if theſe effects were wrought in them they durſt not ſue the juſt and righteous for treble Damages, and make ſuch ſpoil and havock of their Eſtates, as they do, throughout the Nation; taking from ſome eight times as much as is the Due, according to their own Demands. O ſad Generation of men! that dare ſay the Lords Prayer, as they ſay, <hi>Forgive us our Treſpaſſes, as we forgive them that treſpaſs againſt us;</hi> and yet it is like, the next day ſueth for treble Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage for a pretended Treſpaſs, done before he ſaith the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition. Do they think the Lord God, who hath an all-ſeeing eye, doth not know their hypocriſie, and will repay their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit upon their own heads? yea, be aſſured all of you, he will. Do you follow the Rule that Chriſt commandeth, <hi>To do unto
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:172640:44"/>
all men, as you would that all men ſhould do unto you?</hi> Do you expect a day wherein God ſhall judge the ſecrets of all men, by Jeſus Chriſt, and when every man ſhall give an accompt for the things done in his bodie? And do ye think that theſe actions before-rehearſed, will ſtand and bear weight in that day? O fear and tremble: for whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he aſſuredly reap; he that ſoweth to his fleſh, ſhall of that, reap corruption; but he that ſoweth to the ſpirit, ſhall of that, reap life everlaſting: for they that are led by the Spirit of God, they are the ſons of God; and they that are led by their wills and luſts, whoſe ſervants are they? the Apoſtle tells you, That <hi>of whomſoever a man is overcome, his ſervant he is; whether it be of ſin unto death, or of obedience unto righteouſneſs. And therefore awake thou that ſleepeſt, and ſtand up from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light: and be not drunk with wine wherein is exceſs; but be ye filled with the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> and look to ſee that Scripture fulfilled in you, that ye are covetors of ſpiritual things, and all other Scriptures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: for they are written for our Inſtruction, upon whom the ends of the world ſhall fall; and leave off the woolviſh nature, the dogs nature, the lyons nature, and the deſtroying nature; and put on the Lambs nature, be tender hearted one to another; and if any man have a quarrel againſt another, forgive it, even as God for Chriſts ſake, forgiveth thee: if thou unfainedly repent, and turn from the evil of thy doings, then the Lord will blot out all thy tranſgreſſions, and he will remember thy ſins no more. <hi>O turn ye, turn ye: for why will ye die, ye houſe of Iſrael?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore let all now take up the ſore lamentation, and teturn unto him, that they may be ſaved: for Jeſus is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſave to the utmoſt all thoſe that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them: and they that do forſake lying vanities, and cleave unto him, bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, yea, for ever bleſſed are they; for they that have part in this firſt Reſurrection, from the death of ſin unto the life of Grace, over ſuch the ſecond death ſhall have no power; but they ſhall reign as Lords and kings, for ever and ever; and the high praiſes of God ſhall be found in their mouthes, and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:172640:44"/>
they ſhall be all cloathed with white, the white Robes of his Righteouſneſs; and follow the Lamb whitherſoever he go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; and he will lead them unto the lively Fountains, and wipe away all tears from their eyes; and they ſhall ſing prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and hallelujahs unto him, for ever and ever: for he hath found them worthy, and hath given them to be with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they may behold his glory, and ſee him as he is: for none of Chriſts prayers ſhall fail: He ſaith, <hi>Father, I will that thoſe whom thou hast given me may be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory; that as thou, O Father, art in me, and I in thee; ſo that they may be made one in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s,</hi> Joh. 17. 23, 24. And they have all this benefit here, that if they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide in Chriſt, and his Word abide in them, let them ask what they will, and it ſhall be done unto them. <hi>And herein is my Father glorified</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that you bear much fruit,</hi> Joh. 15. 7, 8. <hi>Theſe things have I ſpoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full,</hi> ſaith Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now as for all others, let them be in what form of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſoever, if they be out of the Life and Power of Chriſt, as is before ſhewed, who are in the life, which are onely ſuch that have the ſeed of God raiſed in their own particulars, and alwayes obey it in the power thereof; ſuch are not under the power of the Law, but under Grace: and the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus which dwelleth in them, hath made them free from the Law of ſin and of death; and they, and they onely are Chriſts, becauſe they are led by the Spirit of Chriſt: and all others, let their forms be Epiſcopal, Presbytery, Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, Anabaptiſts, or whatever; all their Worſhip is but will-Worſhip; and their eatings and drinkings, and waſhings, and preachings, and ſingings, and hearings, are all but the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Fools, being all will Worſhip, the inventions of mens hands, out of the life and power of the truth, as it is in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; and therefore is before the Lord, but as the cutting off a dogs neck, being a blind zeal without knowledge: for I know upon what ground they all ſtand, having run through all theſe Forms, and could never finde reſt for the ſole of my feet, in them; neither can any find true peace, until they come to lie down in the Father, worſhipping him in Spirit
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:172640:45"/>
and in Truth, being holy in all manner of converſation: for unto ſuch it is become natural to do the will of their Father on Earth, as it is done in Heaven.</p>
            <p>And therefore I do dearly exhort you all, men and women, to whom this ſhall come, to keep cloſe to the pure ſeed of God in you: for that is your true Teacher; and follow it, and it will ſhew you the Father and the Son: and if you o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey this Doctrine, you ſhall know that it is of God: and lend not your ears at any time or place unto the Tempter, but cruſh the Serpent in the firſt motions of ſin; and then they turn upon his own accompt, and not upon thine: for it is no ſin to be tempted, but the ſin is to yeild: for when luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſin and ſin when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth death. Therefore break the Cocka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trice Egg, before it be hatched, that it may never come to be a Serpent: and <hi>reſist the devil, and he will flee from you;</hi> and turn in the minde to the pure light, and wait in it, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved you may all be out of that ſin and evil that would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file you: for this pure Principle of God in you, will not conſent at any time to ſin, but will check and reprove for it; and if its motions be obeyed, it will keep you all ſingle and unſpotted of the world; and ſo you ſhall be found worthy to follow the Lamb in this the day of his power, wherein he is riſen to make War with the Beaſt and falſe Prophet. And therefore it doth concern every one continually to watch, and to have their loines girt about with the preparation of the Goſpel of Truth, that is, with Jeſus, the Word, by whom all things were made, who is in all his Babes and Children that are born again; and thoſe that have his commandments and keepeth them, dwelleth in him, and he in them: and this Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſins of the world, ſhall have the Victory: and bleſſed and thrice happy are all they that can come to witneſs, ſenſibly, in their own particular, him riſing in them, that are truly fighting under his Bann<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin, the world, and the devil; and feel a dayly conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of ſin; <hi>that die dayly</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith) <hi>unto ſin, that they may be made alive unto God;</hi> and (as <hi>David</hi> ſaith) <hi>that hateth the very appearance of evil.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:172640:45"/>
And the onely way to this, is to keep low in ones ſelf, and to wait in the cool of the day, turning in to the light, and in it wait; and put on the whole Armour of God, that you may be preſerved at all times out of the ſnares of Satan: for this will let you ſee ſenſibly, the Tree that bringeth forth corrupt fruit to be cut down in you, and a new plant raiſed, which will bring forth its fruit in due ſeaſon, to the glory of the Lord, who alone is worthy of all glory and honour, and everlaſting praiſes, for ever and for ever.</p>
            <p>And therefore all Friends, keep in the pure fear and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the Lord, that at all times you may be ordered by it, to do all things to his glory, at all times, and in all places; that you may be a good ſavour unto all men you have to do withal; and let your ſouls truly pant and thirſt after the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, as the hart panteth after the water-brooks: for your Redeemer is neer you, if you refuſe him not: <hi>the Word is nigh thee, even in thy heart and in thy mouth:</hi> and, <hi>the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven is within you,</hi> as is plainly ſhewed in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: and if Satan be in his firſt motions reſiſted, you ſhall plainly ſee him paſs away, as the ſhadows paſs away, and the dew, when the Sun ariſeth.</p>
            <p>And therefore keep in the pure fear and wiſdom of God, that with it you may be ordered and guided in all things, to do them to his glory; and ſo you ſhall ſenſibly witneſs the ſeed of God in you all to reign, that will trample Satan un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der feet: and then ſhall the ſaints rejoyce, and they ſhall wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs pure and holy rejoycings, with ſongs of Triumph and Praiſes, with Glory, Glory, Glory, and everlaſting Praiſes to their Father, which is in heaven, who is worthy.</p>
            <p>We have had great ſtirs in the Nation, of late years, by Souldiers, and great Words, and good Language have they ſpoken, that they would do much for Chriſt, and the ſetling of his Kingdom, which they do not know; and the protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his people, whoſe Life is in it, being in Righteouſneſs, Peace, and Joy in the holy Ghoſt; which is a hard thing for a Souldier that kills men for mony, houſes, lands and goods, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to witneſs, until with <hi>Zacheus,</hi> he reſtore to him that he hath robbed by forged cavilation, and to the debtor his pledge.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:172640:46"/>
But the whole Nation is ſenſible, if they be not wilfully blind, of the backſliding and Apoſtatizing of the Army, and how in all changes they have ſought themſelves, and not the things of God: it is like they have forgot that Text, <hi>Joh. 18. 16. My kingdom</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>is not of this world:</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Rom. 14. 17. The kingdom of God is not meat and drink,</hi> nor yet Arms and Armies, but <hi>righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> which Souldiers and Armies uſually deſtroy and confound: and therefore Chriſts Souldiers muſt have onely the ſword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, which leadeth them into all the truth and peace, and condemneth the very practices of this Army, that hath ſo often changed and ſworn, and engaged, with hands lifted up to heaven, and yet broke all as faſt as made them, to the ſadding of the hearts of all their faithful friends, to the ſtrengthning of the hands of their enemies; and if they do not ſpeedily repent, they muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the great God will pay their hypocriſie and deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dealings, with indignation and wrath upon the heads of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them that doth, or hath done evil: and when the meaſure of their iniquities are full, they muſt expect wrath from heaven to be poured down upon them, and there ſhall be no Remedy: For they may read that <hi>David,</hi> although a man after Gods own heart, yet becauſe his hands were dipt in bloud, the Lord would not let him build an houſe unto his Name. <hi>Zach. 4. 6. Not by power, but by my Spirit, ſaith the Lord of hosts, is this work to be done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We read that Souldiers have been great enemies to Chriſt and his Kingdom, <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 23, 24, 32, 34. the Souldiers armed with ſwords, ſtaves, and ſpears, were imployed to take Chriſt, and apprehend him, to bring him to <hi>Pilate;</hi> they ſtripped him of his Garments and Robes, and crowned him with Thorns; they ſpit in his Face, they buffeted him, they gave him vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar to drink, they crucified him, and caſt lots for his garments; they thruſt a ſpear through his ſide, they watched the Sepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, for fear he ſhould be taken away; and after he was riſen, the chief Prieſts gave large money to the Souldiers to broach their lies, that his Diſciples came by night, and ſtole him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way while they ſlept: The Souldiers ſtretched forth their
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:172640:46"/>
hands to vex certain of the Church; they killed <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle with the ſword; they apprehended <hi>Peter,</hi> and put him in priſon, where he was guarded day and night with four Quaternions of Souldiers, to prevent an eſcape.</p>
            <p>The Lord hath reſolved that men of blood, as is before ſhewed, ſhall not build his houſe: Chriſt is the King and Prince of Peace, and his Subjects are the Subjects of Peace; Chriſts Goſpel is the Goſpel of Peace, his Apoſtles and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters the Embaſſadors of Peace, and his Kingdom conſiſts in Righteouſneſs and Peace. Now nothing is more directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite, inconſiſtent and deſtructive to this Peace, to the King, Prince, Goſpel, Embaſſadors, and Kingdom of Peace, then Armies, Wars, Souldiers and Arms are: and therefore you may read, that when Chriſt ſent forth his Diſciples to preach his Goſpel, and ſet up his Kingdom, he did not chuſe Captains of thouſands and hundreds, nor yet Souldiers and armed men, but Fiſher-men and others, altogether averſe from war; and commanded them in expreſs terms, not to take <hi>gold, ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, nor braſs in their purſes, nor ſcrip, nor two coats, nor yet ſtaves;</hi> much leſs Piſtols, Muſquets, Pikes, Carbines, Swords: for Chriſt expreſly meaneth that his Miniſters muſt be no figh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, no ſtrikers, ſtrivers, much leſs profeſſed Warriers; and their weapons muſt be the Spirit, and their mouth, the Word of God; and they muſt fight onely againſt mens luſts and ſins, not againſt their perſons.</p>
            <p>It is propheſied by the holy men of old, That <hi>men ſhall learn war no more, but his people ſhall break their ſpears into pruning books, and their ſwords into plough-ſhares: for Nation ſhall not riſe againſt Nation, nor lift up the ſword any more; neither ſhall they learn war any more, but live in peace.</hi> And theſe things ſhall be fulfilled, when Chriſts Kingdom cometh to be ſet up; <hi>and they ſhall keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore let me admoniſh you all, to leave off your diſſembling, &amp; tell people in plain terms, you fight to get great Eſtates, and kill men for mony: and ſad and miſerable will be the end of you, unleſs you repent, and perform all thoſe Ingagements, Vows and Promiſes made at <hi>Triplo-</hi>Heath,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:172640:47"/>
               <hi>New-Market,</hi> and other places; where, by your large De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, Remonſtrances, profeſſed by you, that you aimed at nothing but the publick good, you cauſed many honeſt hearts to joyn with you, to the ſhedding of Blood. And therefore ſpeedily repent, and turn to the Lord, with faſting, weeping and mourning, and ſet your ſelves to do Juſtice in the earth, for fear it ſpeedily open her mouth, and ſwallow you up, as it did <hi>Corah, Dathan</hi> and <hi>Abiram:</hi> for aſſure your ſelves, the Lord is coming againſt you in Judgement, and he will be avenged on every one of you, great and ſmall.</p>
            <p>And therefore, if you expect to reign with Chriſt, I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you once more, Speedily repent, and put away the evil of your doings, and go way, and ſin no more, by your deceitful wicked practices, leſt a worſe thing come unto you.</p>
            <p>And conſider how often you have declared to put your helping hand and utmoſt endeavours to regulate the Laws, that are ſo exceeding chargeable and burdenſome to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Nation, that I have heard it credibly reported, That according to calculation, caſt up by good Arithmeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, that ſay, There is neer ſeven millions of mony ſpent yearly, by the people of the Nation, in Law and Equity; and above one hundred thouſand a year, it cannot be leſs, amongſt Serjeants, Bayliffs, and ſuch kind of needleſs Officers, beſides many perſons murdered every year, in and about Arreſts, and eſcaping from Serjeants, that no Nation but <hi>England</hi> can parallel the like practices: which is a ſhame to all that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the knowledge of the Lord, and makes the very Turks ſay in their common ſpeech, as I have been credibly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when any doth them ſome great injury, <hi>I think you will uſe me like a Chriſtian:</hi> O abominable ſhame! that Turks muſt riſe in Judgement, and condemn the great Talkers of Religion in <hi>England:</hi> and this heightens the ſpirits of Judges, and makes them proud, and not like their Predeceſſors, that rode to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> upon Aſſes to ſhew their humility, from Serjeants Inne, and back again to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and did not vaunt and lord it over the people as ſome have done of late years, and gained great riches for themſelves and their Favourites and Creatures; it is to be feared not juſtly, but
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:172640:47"/>
evilly: juſt like the Papiſt Prieſts in former times, when moſt of thoſe Laws now in being were made, who gained in their times moſt part of the great ſituations, and beſt Lands in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by Combination, Craft and Subtilty; by lulling the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple aſleep in ignorance and blindneſs, in their vain ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, pronouncing hell and damnation, with bell, book and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, to all that did not obſerve the ſame; and thereby brought the people into a fond belief of them: for ſince that fall, thoſe, that is to ſay, the Judges and their favorites, have far out-run thoſe Prieſts, in gaining riches in an exceſſive manner, by gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping very many men.</p>
            <p>And it is to be obſerved, that many of them have come of poor and indigent Parentage, yet have they climed up, and leaped into moſt of the Lordly Titles and gainful places and Offices in the Nation, and therein and thereby have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neered and tyrannized over, and oppreſſed the honeſt people, and gained the favour of fawning, flattering, and laſcivious Courtiers, by Rewards which they have uſually given at their enterance, which they have made up again out of others, to their ſorrows; contrary to the practice of the Judges in old time, in this Nation; and the Lawyers formerly were milde to their Clyents, and honeſt, (as I muſt confeſs, ſome I have had trial of, hath been to me, as Serjeant <hi>Twiſden, William Wilde, Shelton,</hi> and a few others) and uſed them very kindly, and had great care of their buſineſs; ſeldom any Lawyer ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king above one Fee in one Cauſe in a Term; and they did not let their Clyents ſtandCap in hand, and make them ſcrape legs, and beſeech them to take their mony, and take large exceſſive Fees, as ſome will, and have done, and pretend they are afraid one of another: as Serjeant <hi>Conyers</hi> took a Fee of me to move in Chancery, and kept it four ſeveral dayes; and Serjeant <hi>Maynard,</hi> and <hi>Chal. Chute</hi> was fee'd to defend the motion; and that Cauſe was in an Order poſitive, That unleſs cauſe was ſhewed that day, I was in a manner undone, in a buſineſs of almoſt all my Eſtate: and by the Rules of the Court, I was to ſtand committed, if I ſpake up my ſelf; and I could get no other, the time being ſo ſhort; yet this Serje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, juſt as he came to the Bar, gave me my Fee, and run into
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:172640:48"/>
the Court, and told me the Atturney-General was againſt me, and he durſt not nor would not meddle in the Caſe: So I was forced to move the Commiſſioners my ſelf, and run the hazard of committing to the <hi>Fleet,</hi> or elſe I had been ruined. Now let all men judge, if ſuch Lawyers ought not to be puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed: for by Law they ought to be for ever put by pleading in that Court, or any other, and ſuffer impriſonment, during the pleaſure of the King or chief Magiſtrate, as you may read by the Statute of 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. chap. 29. The Life of the Law is execution of it. And ſome, nay, too many, have taken large Fees to ſpeak in Cauſes, to my knowledge, and have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver come to the Bar at all; and the Party hath gone and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his money again of them, and they have denyed to give it again; and told their Clyents it was enough for them that they were not againſt them. Is not this a grand Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? and doth not this cry for Vengeance againſt ſuch a Generation as this is, that the Poor, the Fatherleſs, the Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, hath little or no right done him? for if a poor man have never ſo much right to an Eſtate, he cannot get it but by ſuing under <hi>forma pauperis;</hi> and if he be caſt, as many, nay moſt times he is, let his Cauſe be never ſo good or juſt, by the reaſon of a corrupt Judge, and the weight of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries Purſe, which makes moſt Cauſes, according to the late practiſes and proceedings, then the poor man muſt be whipt at the Carts Tayl, ſaith our Laws: and if any man lends the poor man money to ſue for his Eſtate, then it is Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty and Maintenance, ſaith the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratry: and the man that doth it, muſt be fined all his Eſtate, and be puniſhed with impriſonment, and pilloried, or what pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment a corrupt Judge pleaſeth to put upon him. And now, Souldiers, will you tell us you have regulated our Laws? I ſay unto you, Up and be doing, and act like men of courage, and do ſome great things for us, according to all your Oaths, Declarations, Remonſtrances and Engagements; or aſſure your ſelves, the proudeſt of you ſhall be daſhed and broken to pieces, like a Potters Veſſel, and none ſhall be able to deliver you: for the Lord is riſen, and will ſtand by his redeemed ones, whom you are now helping to eat up, as men eat bread,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:172640:48"/>
and ſtand them in no ſtead at all: and your gilded Promiſes and ſpecious pretences will not hold out without doing; it is he that doth good, and he that keepeth promiſe, ſhall come into the holy Hill; they that break it ſhall be ſure to be caſt forth for ever: your Form of Godlineſs, without the Power, is known, and is diſcerned by all men, who have their eyes in their heads.</p>
            <p>Now having done with the Deceipt of theſe men, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, I muſt ſpeak a few words, in the vindication of a Party, who hath ſome calumnies caſt upon her, by the ſcandalous Pen of a lying Prieſt, one <hi>Tho. Danſon</hi> at <hi>Sandwich</hi> in <hi>Kent;</hi> it is on the behalf of one he calleth Mrs. <hi>Dorothy Gudderſon,</hi> in his Book called <hi>The Quakers folly opened, by him,</hi> as he alledgeth, upon his Diſpute at <hi>Sandwich,</hi> with three Quakers, on the 12, 13, 14. dayes of the month he calleth <hi>April,</hi> in the year 1659. wherein he ſtiles himſelf, <hi>Fellow of Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Colledge in Oxon:</hi> where he might, if he had made good uſe of his time, have learned more manners then to traduce a perſon ſo much above him by Birth and Parentage, as ſhe is; which thing he highly eſteemeth and prizeth, although ſhe denieth it; having ſo learned Chriſt, as to count all things but droſs and dung, that ſhe may be found in him, not having her own Righteouſneſs, which is by the Law, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Righteouſneſs which is by Chriſt, through faith in his blood, and ſo expecting Juſtification by the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jeſus Chriſt within her. And this I know is her whole deſire, panting and breathing after holineſs; as the hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo longeth or breatheth her ſoul after the living God.</p>
            <p>And thus <hi>Tho. Danſon</hi> beginneth his Diſcourſe of her: <hi>I will tell thee a true ſtory, which may perhaps move thy laughter.</hi> Juſt like a Jeſter in a Play, more like then a ſtaid Fellow of a Colledge; wherein he condemneth her for denying to kiſs a Gentleman, and is aſhamed to tell it was himſelf: for I being preſent the ſame time, perceived by his countenance, as far as one may judge or diſcover by outward appearance of another, that he was much diſturbed that ſhe refuſed him to ſalute her:
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:172640:49"/>
and the paſſage was thus: He coming to ſalute her, ſhe put forth her hand to him, and ſaid, <hi>That ſo far as God had made manifeſt to her any ſin, or vain cuſtome of the world, ſhe ſhould and had denied her ſelf in it: and that ſhe did believe to be one.</hi> And verily he might have been ſo far judicious, after ſo many high complements uſed to her, and his wife inviting her to his houſe, as to have forborn the putting her in print, juſt in the end of his Book, as much as in him lay, to make her ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous to her Friends, Kindred and Acquaintance; when ſhe ſaid ſhe believed it, and he may know, that what is not of faith, is ſin.</p>
            <p>But all men may ſee what ſpirit he is guided by, even a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit. He may be aſhamed of what he held forth at the Meeting, at <hi>Sandwich;</hi> as alſo his traducing of <hi>Samuel Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> charging him with many lies, to my knowledge, in his Book, I being preſent at the Meeting, and alſo knowing <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Fiſher</hi> very well, being confident he is a precious child of the living God, one that is born again, and is a Babe in Chriſt, and his vvhole deſire is to do the vvill of his Father, vvhich his ſoul continually breathes after, vvhich is, the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God that made heaven and earth; and it is his meat and drink to do his vvill on earth; and I am ſure this is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of his ſoul: and that he is a true Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, I do bear Teſtimony unto it, the witneſs of God in me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing raiſed by his Miniſtry: and for thoſe falſe aſperſions caſt upon him, of his receiving a Penſion from the Pope, I know his ſoul abhorreth any ſuch thing; and that he is as great a hater of the Pope, and his vvayes, as any man in <hi>England</hi> is; and I knovv he hath no ſuch need, nor ever vvill have: <hi>For they that ſeek the Kingdom of God, and the Righteouſneſs thereof, all other things ſhall he administred unto them:</hi> and I do verily think, that there is not a man in <hi>England</hi> more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to confute Errour and Hereſie, then <hi>Samuel Fiſher</hi> is.</p>
            <p>And verily, <hi>Tho. Danſon</hi> did exceedingly vvreſt the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, giving his dark and blinde meanings of them, at that Meeting in <hi>Sandwich:</hi> for he ſaid, <hi>We were not juſtified by that Chriſt that was in us;</hi> he ſaid, <hi>No, no,</hi> twice to it: for he owned two Chriſts, one vvithout the Saints, and another
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:172640:49"/>
within them. But this he became aſhamed of, and diſowned in the Meeting: and then he owned but one Chriſt in the Saints and in Heaven, as there is but one God; though he be in heaven, yet is he with him that is poor, and of a contrite heart, and trembleth at his word. Yet ſtill he could not clear himſelf from his former aſſertion, in his denying Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt within: for he might as well have ſaid, That Chriſt and his Righteouſneſs was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; inaſmuch as he owned Chriſt in the Saints, but not his Righteouſneſs, which juſtified: and all his Diſcourſe and Drift was, to have men juſtified in their ſins, and to be ſinners all their lives, as one that juſtifieth the wicked, <hi>Prov. 7. 15. Iſa. 26. 12. God hath wrought all our works in us,</hi> ſaith the Prophet: <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 5, 9. ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Abrahams faith was counted to him for Righteouſneſs:</hi> and this Prieſt is a bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterer of men up in their ſins, and ſows pillows under their arms, as I may ſo ſay, in compariſon: for he calleth them worthy that are his hearers, that loveth flattering and fained Titles, and the fawnings of men, which is deceipt; when none ought to have the Title of Worthy, but thoſe that truly ſet their faces toward <hi>Sion,</hi> and ſeek it with their whole hearts, and deſire to have the King of Righteouſneſs and Prince of Peace, to guide them and rule them in all their actions and works, that they may witneſs them to be all wrought in GOD.</p>
            <p>Now this perſon, <hi>Tho. Danſon,</hi> all his teachings tendeth to a Juſtification of Chriſt without us, and not to a Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wrought by Chriſt within us; and ſo his hearers can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attain to that perfect peace that the Scripture ſpeaks of, which is thus written, That <hi>he that ſtayes himſelf upon the Lord, he keepeth ſuch in perfect peace;</hi> and there is no peace to be found out of a man: the peace is within the Heart; the Goſpel, Chriſt Jeſus, the enlivening Word is within the ſoul; and he is the pure Word, Power and Wiſdom of the Father, who is the onely Reconciler unto God, who is made manifeſt for the ſame purpoſe, to break down the partition-vvall which ſeparates the ſoul from God, &amp; to bring the ſoul into its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place &amp; centre, into Unity &amp; Fellowſhip withGod, who is
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:172640:50"/>
Light, in whom there is no Darkneſs; and ſo by abiding in this living Word Chriſt, and he abiding in you, the creatures are brought to ſerve the ever living God in newneſs of life, and in the Spirit; and ſo Chriſt will and doth work their work in them and for them, to their everlaſting ſalvation: and ſo the firſt fruits of the Spirit, maketh them alive unto God; and according to Chriſts words, <hi>He that believeth in him hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlasting life, and he ſhall never come into condemnation, but ſhall paſs from death unto life: for Chriſt alone is the onely Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and there is no name under heaven given unto men, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they can be ſaved, but by the Name of Jeſus.</hi> And this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel Chriſt, is a free gift of God: it is not to be bought for mony, as <hi>Tho. Danſon</hi> falſly ſurmiſeth: for he muſt know, that there is a neceſſity laid upon thoſe that are the true Teachers of the Goſpel, and woes is to be upon them, if they do not teach freely, and be inſtant in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon: for Chriſt ſaith to them, <hi>As ye have freely received, ſo freely give:</hi> and ſo having received from the Lord that which they do deliver unto the Saints, they ſpeak from a pure Principle of Life and Power, that reacheth the witneſs of God in their Hearers, and they live themſelves in the Life and Power of what they ſpeak, and ſo by their good examples are a good ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour unto all men that they have to do withal; and ſo they bring people into the pure and perfect image of Chriſt, and the unity of Faith, which brings them to the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure and the ſtature and the fulneſs of Chriſt; and they ſay, We that are dead unto ſin, how can we live any longer therein? and ſuch are in the number of ſuch as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>We preach wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom amongſt thoſe that be perfect; not the wiſdom of the world, but the wiſdom and power of God, which is pure and peaceable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it is good and righteous to let the people know the falſe Teachers, and thoſe that call themſelves Miniſters of Chriſt, and are not, but are of the Synagogues of Satan. And the true Prophets of the Lord, alwayes did ſtir the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples memory up with theſe Deceivers: <hi>Iſaiah</hi> cried againſt ſuch Hirelings as ſeeked gain from their Quarters, <hi>Iſa. 56. Jeremiah</hi> cried againſt ſuch as taught for hire, and divined for

Chriſt himſelf cried againſt ſuch as were called of men, Maſter, ſtood praying in the Synagogues, and had the chiefeſt places in the Aſſemblies, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> declared againſt ſuch as went in the way of <hi>Cain,</hi> in envie; and ſuch as went after the ways of <hi>Balaam,</hi> for gifts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>Jud. 11. Peter</hi> declared againſt ſuch as through fained words and covetouſneſs made Merchandize of the people, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 5. theſe and ſuch-like practices mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts the falſe Teachers: for they that have not the Spirit of the Lord Jeſus dwelling bodily in them, leading them into all the fruits of Holineſs and Righteouſneſs, making them perfect in Chriſt; unleſs they be ſuch, they are no Miniſters of Chriſt, let their pretences be what they will: <hi>For they that are Chriſts have crucified the fleſh, with the affections and luſts thereof;</hi> and, <hi>they that live in the Spirit, ſhall not fulfill the luſts of the fleſh;</hi> and <hi>they that are riſen with Chriſt, ſeek the things that are above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of the Throne of God, and they do not mind earthly things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore all dear Friends, mind the pure love of the eternal God, the loving Father unto you all, to manifeſt his living pure way of Truth, Life and Salvation unto you, which is treaſured up in Chriſt, who is in you that believe, <hi>the hope of glory:</hi> and therefore lay hold upon him, and highly prize this the day of your viſitation, which the Father hath given you all in tender love to your ſouls, which the Lord deſires the ſalvation of: for the Lord ſaith, <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, I deſire not the death of a ſinner, but that he may turn from his wickedneſs, and live:</hi> and, <hi>God would have none to periſh, but that all might come to the knowledge of the truth, that they might be ſaved.</hi> And what is the Reaſon when men have the meaſure of the manifeſtation of the true light of Chriſt in them, which is given them to profit withal, that they are not ſaved? The Reaſon is, Becauſe they will not part with their Luſts, their darling ſins: for they love Darkneſs more then Light, becauſe their Deeds are evil; and they will not come unto the light, that they may have their deeds made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt: and, <hi>Thy condemnation is of thy ſelf, O Iſrael:</hi> and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I ſtand at the door and knock: if any man will
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:172640:51"/>
open, I will come in, and ſup with him, and he with me. O Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, Jeruſalem, that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt thoſe that are ſent unto thee, how often would I have gathered thee together as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings! and ye would not.</hi> So thy rebellious ſinful nature leadeth thee to thy everlaſting deſtruction, becauſe thou takeſt pleaſure in unrighteouſneſs and ſin, and thou ſlighteſt the pure wayes of the living God, and counteſt the blood of the Covenant an unholy thing, and thou doſt deſpite unto the Spirit of Grace.</p>
            <p>And therefore now ſearch and try your wayes, and turn to the Lord, and put away the evil of your doings, and learn to do well; and the Lord will heal all your back-ſlidings, and will love you freely, and remember your ſins paſt no more, if you from this day go away and ſin no more. But if you go on in ſin, know, That although judgement is not ſpeedily exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted againſt evil doers, yet the Lord will puniſh aſſuredly the hairy ſcalp of him that goeth on in his ſins and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes; and when the meaſure of thy iniquities are fully ripe, then Judgement ſhall come upon thee to the utmoſt, and there ſhall be no Remedy, and none ſhall be able to deliver thee, in the day of the Lords wrath. And therefore ſtand in aw, and ſin not, leſt a worſe thing come upon thee, then yet hath done. And therefore confeſs thy ſins unto the Lord, and he is faithful and juſt to forgive thee thy ſins. But woe be unto him that covereth his ſin, and hideth his Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: for he ſhall not proſper.</p>
            <p>Therefore high and low, rich and poor, learned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned, turn unto the Lord, and harden not your hearts: and let the great ones know, That the Almighty God is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt them, and he will plead with them, by fire and by the ſword; and the ungodly ſhall be as chaff before the wind, as ſtubble before the fire: for the day of the Lord ſhall burn as an Oven, and the day ſhall burn up all that do wickedly: for the Lord God will not be mocked, but he will be avenged on his enemies; and all the unbelieving and unrighteous ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of men, both Prieſts and People, ſhall feel the ſtroke of his almighty Arm of Power, if they do not ſpeedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:172640:51"/>
and turn unto him, and leave off their wicked deceitful wayes, and their doings that are not good: for they are wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing in their own wayes, and their hearts are running a whoring after their own inventions. And therefore return unto the Lord, and learn Righteouſneſs now at the laſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you die: for as the Tree falleth, ſo it lieth, and there is no Repentance in the grave whither thou goeſt; and as death leaveth, Judgement findeth: for this I ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> doth, <hi>That according to the way that most men call hereſie, ſo worſhip I the God of my Fathers; believing all things which are written in the Law and the Prophets, and that there ſhall be a reſurrection both of the juſt, and the unjuſt, a reſurrection of the dead: and herein do I exerciſe my ſelf, to have alwayes a conſcience void of offence, towards God and towards man.</hi> Act. 1. 10, 11. <hi>And while they looked ſtedfaſtly towards heaven, as he went up; behold, two men ſtood by them in white apparel, which alſo ſaid, Ye men of Galilee, why ſtand yee gazing up into heaven? this ſame Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, which is taken up from you into heaven, ſhall ſo come in like manner, as ye have ſeen him go into heaven.</hi> Act. 2. 20. <hi>The Sun ſhall be turned into darkneſs, and the Moon into blood, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that great and notable day of the Lord come,</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 15, 16, 17. <hi>For this we ſay unto you by the word of the Lord, That we which are alive, and remain unto the coming of the Lord, ſhall not prevent them that are aſleep: for the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the Arch-Angel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt: then we which are alive and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air; and ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord.</hi> 1 Theſ. 5. <hi>But ye, brethren, are not in darkneſs, that that day ſhould overtake you as a thief,</hi> 2 Theſ. 7, 8. <hi>And to you which are troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven with his mighty Angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power, when he ſhall come to be glorified in his Saints, and to be admired in all them that believe.</hi> As <hi>Paul</hi> reaſoned with <hi>Felix,</hi> (Act. 24. 25.)
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:172640:52"/>
of Judgement, <hi>Felix trembled, and ſaid, Go thy way, I will call for thee, when I have a convenient ſeaſon.</hi> 1 Cor. 15. <hi>If after the manner of men</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) I have fought with beaſts at Epheſus, what advantageth it me, if the dead riſe not?</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 43. It is raiſed in power, by the mighty power of him that is Almighty, that ſaid, Let there be light, and it was ſo; and laid the Foundations of the earth, by the word of his power, &amp; can deſtroy it in the very twinkling of an eye, by the word of his power, 1 <hi>Cor. 15. 52. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the trumpet ſhall ſound, and the dead ſhall be raiſed incorruptible, and we ſhall be changed.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 10. <hi>For we must all appear before the Judgement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his Body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 7. <hi>But the heavens and the earth which are now, by the ſame word, are kept in store, reſerved unto fire, againſt the day of Judgement, and perdition of ungodly men.</hi> Verſ. 10. <hi>But the day of the Lord ſhall come as a thief in the night, in the which the heavens ſhall paſs away with a great noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat; and the earth, with the works that therein are, ſhall be burnt up.</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>Looking for, and haſting to the coming of the day of God, wherein the heavens being on fire, ſhall be diſſolved, and the Elements ſhall melt with fervent heat.</hi> Mal. 4. 1. <hi>For behold, the day cometh, that ſhall burn as an Oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly ſhall be ſtubble; and the day that cometh ſhall burn them up, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, and ſhall leave them neither root nor branch.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could inſtance many more places to clear it, and to ſhew the Lords purpoſe in it, to make his mighty power to appear, and to ſhew to all that ever was, his Juſtice in fulfilling his promiſe to his redeemed Ones, and to lay all their ſins upon the Prince of Darkneſs, the Devil, for tempting the new-born Babes of Chriſt; and he not prevailing over them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe greater is he that is in them, then he that is in the world; and ſin muſt not go unpuniſhed: therefore Satan tempting, and they not yeilding, it is all treaſured upon his accompt, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that terrible day: and if it were not for that day, he ſhould ſtill remain, and be a Deceiver of the Brethren, and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:172640:52"/>
ſtill range up and down the earth, and do wickedneſs. But his day of wrath is approaching, and that day is it, as you may ſee plainly, in that Epiſtle of <hi>Jude,</hi> verſ. 6. <hi>And the Angels, which kept not their firſt estate, but left their own habitation, he hath reſerved in everlaſting chains under darkneſs, unto the judgement of the great day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When this day is, none knoweth but the Father, who keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it to himſelf: but thy particular, and the men of this Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations day of Judgement is at hand; and therefore it is good to live in judgement at all times: for bleſſed is the man that feareth alwayes. And verily it is a bleſſed ſtate for a man to wait on the Lord at all times: for bleſſed is he that wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth on him: and, ſalvation is of the Lord, and his bleſſing is upon his people. And when the minde is ſtayed upon God, then the heart judgeth down ſin in the firſt riſe of it, and ſo it is blaſted and laid upon the devils accompt, that is the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter: and the mind that is always ſtaid upon the Lord, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon that pure ſeed of God in him, judgeth down ſin at all times, and ſin hath no entrance in that heart, but it is, by the power of Chriſt in him, kept pure, and clean, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corrupt, and holy as God is holy, in all manner of converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as it is written, <hi>Be ye holy, as I am holy; and be ye per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, as your Father which is in heaven is perfect.</hi> Now all thoſe that allow themſelves in any ſin or luſt of the fleſh, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of God, neither can any ſacrifice that man or woman doth, be accepted. <hi>If I regard iniquity in my heart, God will not hear my prayer:</hi> and, <hi>the ſacrifice of the wicked is an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination in the ſight of the Lord God:</hi> and, <hi>the prayers of the wicked ſhall turn into ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore cleanſe your hands, you ſinners, and purifie your hearts, ye double-minded; that when that day cometh, you may be found in the number of thoſe that ſhall have the Sun of Righteouſneſs ariſe upon them, with healing under his wings; and they ſhall grow up as fat Calves: for their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption draweth near. And as for the wicked, wo to them, it ſhall go ill with them: for the wicked ſhall be turned into Hell, and all people that forget God: For the Lord is known by the Judgements which he executeth, when he ſnareth the wicked in the works of his own hands.</p>

ſuch he doth make to excel in Vertue: and the Lord will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verturn all falſe deceitful Powers, that are not of his plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and he will root them up, and leave them neither Root nor Branch, and they ſhall feel the ſtroke of his Almighty Arm, in this the day of his fierce wrath: for it is coming up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Hypocrites in <hi>Sion;</hi> for the Marriage of the Lamb is come: now is he coming in power and great glory, and none but the pure in heart ſhall ſee him; and they ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him as he is: for the Lord is the God of Truth, and an everlaſting King: at his anger the earth ſhall tremble, and the nations cannot abide his wrath: for he hath made the earth by his power, and eſtabliſhed the world by his wiſdom, and hath ſtretched out the heavens by his diſcretion; he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the clouds to aſcend unto the ends from the earth.</p>

Then opened he their understandings, that they might underſtand the Scriptures:</hi> the onely vvay to obtain this favour from the Lord, is to love the pure ſeed of God, in the vvhich is Gods vvitneſs in thy Conſcience, and is his written VVord in thy heart, vvhich vvas that VVord to <hi>David,</hi> that he had ſuch a love unto, that by loving of it, God made him vviſer then his Teachers, and it vvas ſweeter then the honey and the honey comb, and it vvas better then thouſands of Gold and Silver: and <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith of this vviſdome, <hi>The merchandiſe is better then the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe of ſilver, and the gain thereof is better then gold:</hi> And this is the Pearl of great price, that the man ſold all to buy it:

therefore my deſire, nay, the deſires of my ſoul, thirſteth after the Salvation of all men. And therefore, dear Friends and People, all be kept lovv in the fear of <hi>God</hi> at all times, and learn of Chriſt to be meek and lovvly, that you may find reſt unto your ſouls; and conſider, that the onely thing is to fear <hi>God,</hi> and keep his Commandments; for they that hath the Commandments, and keepeth them, dvvelleth in Chriſt, and Chriſt in them: and much reading is a vvearineſs to the fleſh: here the end of all is, To fear God, and keep his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; this is the vvhole duty of man: for he that mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts his faith by being obedient, he ſhall live for ever: for the Kingdome of God conſiſteth not in vvords, but in life and povver, vvhich is righteouſneſs; and that procureth true peace, ſuch peace as men and Devils can never take from you: and ſo vvalking in this peace, the God of love and peace vvill be vvith you to the end.

               <p>To <hi>Richard Allen,</hi> a Prieſt in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh of <hi>Crundal</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and alſo to be communicated to the reſt of his Brethren the Prieſts, to ſhew them the unlawfulneſs &amp; wicked Practice of receiving of Tythes, contrary to the Practice of Chriſt and his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; and yet call themſelves, A Goſpel-Miniſtry: But they muſt know, The terrible day of the Lords Wrath is at hand, and this their Act of Oppreſsion muſt come to Judgement.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>WHat haſt thou to do to take the Name of the Lord in thy mouth, ſeeing thou hateſt to be reformed? for, Let him that calleth on the Name of the Lord, depart from iniquity: and, He that ſaith he is in Chriſt, ought ſo to walk as Chriſt hath walked: and, He that hath Faith, it purifieth the heart, and he purifieth himſelf as Chriſt is pure. Now he that liveth in any known ſin, is a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſor of the Law: and, He that keepeth the vvhole Law,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:172640:56"/>
and yet offendeth in one point, is guilty of all: and, He that breaketh one of theſe leaſt Commandments, and teacheth men ſo, ſhall be called the leaſt in the Kingdome of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>Now I do charge thee with the deſiring of thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Goods, which thou haſt no juſt right to, neither by the Law of God, nor juſt Law of Man: but the Reaſon is, there is Laws in being for thy wicked luſt, becauſe all things are out of Gods order: for our Judges are not as they were at firſt, nor our Counſellours as at the beginning; if they were, they might tell the people of the Law, what it is: for the power of the Nation of <hi>England</hi> hath had their Laws inveſted and enacted by Parliaments, and they choſen by the people. Now it vvas never conceived that a people ſhould be ſo void of reaſon, as to give a company of perſons a power to deſtroy their Birth-Right, the property of their Eſtates: for they are called to provide for the ſafety and weal of a people, not for their hurt or damage: and all Laws are grounded upon Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or ought to be; and where Reaſon ceaſeth, there the Law ceaſeth.</p>
            <p>Now thou art ſo ingenuous to confeſs that Tythes came firſt into <hi>England</hi> by the appointment and command of the Pope, and Popiſh Laws: and is it reaſonable that thoſe Laws ſhould binde us, that vvere firſt made by them; vvhen vve are ſo diſtinct from them, that vve now, in our times, have had Laws made amongſt us, for the ſelling and ſequeſtring of their Eſtates, <hi>quatenus</hi> as Papiſts? and that an Act of Parliament made againſt common Right, as Tythes is, common Equity and common Reaſon, is therefore null and void in it ſelf in Law, and ought not to be executed, as appears by theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Laws: See the firſt part of Doctor <hi>Bonham</hi>'s Caſe, fol. 118. and the eighth of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, fol. 3, 30, 33. <hi>E. Caſſanet,</hi> 32. and the 27 <hi>H.</hi> Annuity 41. and the 1 of <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 113. and firſt part of <hi>Cook</hi>'s <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> Lib. 2. Chap. 11.

Yea, (ſaith that Learned Oracle of the Law of <hi>England, Edward Cook,</hi> in the fourth part of
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:172640:57"/>
his <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> fol. 330.) where Reaſon ceaſeth, there the Law ceaſeth: for ſeeing Reaſon is the very Life and Spirit of the Lavv it ſelf, the Law is not to be eſteemed to reſpect that vvhich hath no Reaſon, although the generality of the words at the firſt Inſtitution, or after the Letter, ſeem otherwiſe. And (ſaith the Learned Author, in his firſt part of <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> fol. 140.) all Cuſtoms and Preſcriptions, Acts of Parliament, Lavvs and Judgements that be againſt Reaſon, are void and null in themſelves.</p>
            <p>And ſaith the Armies Atturny <hi>John Cooke,</hi> in the late Kings Caſe ſtated, page the 23. That by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> any Act or Agreement againſt the Laws of God and Nature, as I ſhall prove Tythes are againſt both, is a meer nullity, ſaith he: for as a man hath no hand in making the Laws of God and Nature, no more hath he power to mar or alter them: and he cites the Earl of <hi>Leiceſters</hi> adjudged Caſe for a proof: and all the Judges in <hi>England</hi> cannot make one Caſe to be Law, that is not Reaſon, no more then they can make one Hair white that is naturally black: for Law muſt be Reaſon ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged; and every Law of man muſt be conſonant to the Law of God, otherwiſe they are not Righteous nor Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</p>
            <p>Now what reaſon is there that a poor man taking a Frame at a rack rent, and peradventure hiring money at uſe, and ſpending all his time and pains for a whole year to maintain his charge, which is his duty, being up early, and down late, eating the bread of ſorrow, plowing and ſowing, and buying ſeed himſelf, running the hazard of the loſs of all his Cattle; and for want of a good ſeaſon, peradventure may hardly have the ſeed he caſt into the ground; and after he hath reaped it at his own charge, then for a lazy Prieſt, a Non-Reſident, a Drunkard, a Whoremaſter, a covetous Perſon, ambitious, arrogant, proud, vain, laſcivious, ſwaggering, ſwearing, fighting, lying, unconfcionable, antichriſtian, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Prieſt, as many are ſuch; and ſome are filled with all Unrighteouſneſs, being Enemies to Chriſt, and his choſen Ones, perſecuting the righteous Seed; for ſuch a one to come and take the Tenth of the poor mans Corn: let any man
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:172640:57"/>
judge whether this be reaſon; when the poor man neither imploies him, nor dare not hear him; for fear, if he ſhould come to hear his Will-vvorſhip in his Idol-Temple, he may juſtly fall into the condemnation of the Devil.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayeſt, That <hi>Abraham</hi> paid Tythes to <hi>Melchiſedec.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I anſwer: That was before the Levitical Prieſthood: and Chriſt Jeſus is made <hi>a Prieſt for ever, after the Order of Melchiſedec;</hi> which was thus: <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> met <hi>Abraham</hi> returning from the ſlaughter of the Kings, who brought him Bread and Wine; and <hi>Abraham</hi> gave him the Tenth of the ſpoil: what was this to the paying of Tythes yearly out of his own Eſtate? Canſt thou prove that <hi>Abraham</hi> did pay Tythes out of that?</p>
            <p>And now the Levitical Prieſthood is changed by Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and therefore there is a change of the Law: and now the Prieſthood is not committed to the natural Off-ſpring of <hi>Levi,</hi> or any other Tribe, but to Chriſt Jeſus, the unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Prieſthood, whoſe Kingdom ſtands not in Figures and carnal Ordinances, but in the ſubſtance: <hi>For the time is come,</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>that ye ſhall not worſhip the Father at Jeruſalem, nor in this mountain; but the true worſhippers ſhall worſhip the Father in ſpirit and in truth: for he ſeeketh ſuch to worſhip him.</hi> Now ſince the deſtruction of the Temple at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> thou canſt not read that ever God commanded another houſe to be built.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayeſt that Chriſt Jeſus ſaid, <hi>Ye tythe Mint and Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min; theſe things ye ought not to leave undone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſt Jeſus ſpake then to the Jews, in the time when the Levitical Prieſthood was not ended, who were bound by the Law. But when Chriſt was offered up, he ſaid, <hi>It is finiſhed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now do thou remember, that he that addeth or diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from the words of the Prophecies of this book, his name ſhall be blotted out of the Book of Life: and peruſe thy Letter, and ſee if thou haſt not added.</p>
            <p>Thou haſt thoſe Texts quoted, <hi>No man muzleth the mouth of the Ox, that treadeth out the corn:</hi> and, <hi>No man goeth a warfare at his own charge:</hi> and, <hi>He that plants a Vineyard eats the fruit thereof:</hi> And herein it is agreed, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:172640:58"/>
of Chriſt Jeſus, who are effectually called to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and labour in the Word and Doctrine, ought to be comfortably provided for, that they go not a warfare at their own charge: but this doth not require the world, which lies waſte as a wilderneſs, and is not of the Vineyard, ſhould contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute: for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Father, I pray not for the world, but for thoſe that thou haſt given me out of the world, that they may be one, as thou, O Father, art in me, &amp; I in thee, ſo that they may be made one in us:</hi> therefore no reaſon that they that are of the world ſhould be compelled to give of the ſubſtance of their labours to Chriſts Miniſters: for every man is ſole owner of his own; and he that violently or fraudulently diſpoſſeſſeth him of any, is a Thief and a Robber in the ſight of God and good Men: God abhorreth the ſacrifice of the wicked, and hath no need of his ſubſtance: for <hi>the earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof;</hi> and he will never forſake thoſe that put their truſt in him: and, <hi>The just man ſhall live by his own faith:</hi> and, <hi>If any man with-draw himſelf, ſaith the Lord, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him:</hi> and ſuch as Chriſt ſent forth, he alwayes took care that they never wanted, but they were always kept without being chargeable to any, and they eat the fruits of their own Vineyards which they had planted, not which other men had planted: and by the Churches who were gathered out of the world, were they maintained, to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel to the world, who lay in wickedneſs, unto whom they would not make the Goſpel chargeable or burdenſome; which was their glory, and their crown: and this Example of the Apoſtles, leaves every one free to give him that teacheth, not binding any to the maintenance of thoſe that have leſs need then the Giver.</p>
            <p>And this diſcovers the hireling ſhepherds, that teach for filthy lucre, that fleece the Flock, and not feed them; that have a form of Godlineſs, but deny the power thereof; from ſuch there is an expreſs command to turn away, who make merchandize of the Scriptures: for the Lord ſaith, <hi>They ſhall not profit my people: for they are ever learning, and never able to bring to the knowledge of the truth:</hi> for he that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etn not the life of Faith, to witneſs it in his own particular, how can he teach another?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:172640:58"/>
Thou ſayeſt, That <hi>Peter</hi> converted three thouſand ſouls at one Sermon, and thereby it did appear he was a Miniſter of Chriſt, the Lord effectually working with his Miniſtry, upon the hearts of his hearers.</p>
            <p>Now thou haſt been a Teacher to the People of <hi>Crundal</hi> many years, and name me but one man or woman that hath been converted by thy Miniſtry; and if they can demonſtrate unto me the work of Regeneration, wrought upon them by thy Teaching, then I will pay thee thy Demands. And how canſt thou plead thy ſelf a Miniſter of the Goſpel, and ſue for treble Damages? for learned Judge <hi>Rolle</hi> ſaid in Court, That <hi>Tythes were not due and payable by the Law of the Land:</hi> in a Caſe of Tythes, on the Bench, when he was chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: and when they were paid in the old Law, the Levites, the Fatherleſs, the Widdows, the Strangers, were all to be provided for out of them; and the Prieſts of <hi>England</hi> hath no ſuch cuſtome, but conſume them on their pride and luſts, and wicked covetouſneſs: and the Diſciples of Chriſt were commanded to go into all the world, to preach the Goſpel to every creature; they were not to ſtay in a place: and the ſignes that followed them that believed in their Doctrine, in his Name they ſhould caſt out devils, they ſhall ſpeak with new tongues, they ſhall take up ſerpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it ſhall not hurt them; they ſhall lay hands on the ſick, and they ſhall recover.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayeſt, That Believers ſold their poſſeſſions, and laid them dovvn at the Apoſtles feet.</p>
            <p>But they did diſtribute them as every man had need, they did not purchaſe Lands, and let the money to Uſury and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion, as the Prieſts of this Generation do.</p>
            <p>Thou ſayeſt that <hi>Paul</hi> informs of the qualities of a good Biſhop, to be a man blameleſs, not given to filthy lucre: and Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Go not to Law with any man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now learn thou theſe Leſſons, and follow Righteouſneſs, Faith, Love, Peace, with them that call on the Lord, out of a pure heart.</p>
            <p>Thou directeſt me to that Text, in <hi>Heb. 7. 8. And here

men that die receive Tythes:</hi> read the 11 verſe of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: <hi>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical Prieſthood, for under it the people received the Law, what further need was there that another Prieſt ſhould ariſe after the Order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec? for Chriſt came of another Tribe: he ſprang out of Judah, who was not made after the law of a carnal command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but after the power of an endleſslife:</hi> and verſ. 25. <hi>Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is able alſo to ſave to the utmoſt them that come unto God by him, ſeeing he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them. And it ſhall come to paſsin the laſt dayes,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>I will pour out of my Spirit upon all fleſh, and your ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſhall propheſie; and your young men ſhall ſee viſions, and your old men ſhall dream dreams; and on my ſervants, and on my hand-maids I will pour out of my Spirit in thoſe dayes, and they ſhall propheſie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And verily, I do bear my Teſtimony, that I do witneſs ſuch a people now upon the earth, whom the Lord hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed his ſecrets unto, and doth powerfully work upon the hearts of thouſands, to the turning them from darkneſs unto light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they do receive remiſſion of ſins: and this I do witneſs in my own particular, in great meaſure; bleſſed, yea, for ever bleſſed be his holy and dreadful Name: for he alone is worthy of everlaſting Praiſes from his Own, both now, henceforth, and for ever. And woes, everlaſting woes will be the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all thoſe that oppreſs his righteous Ones.</p>
            <p>Now I finde that all men that will attain unto ſalvation, muſt hear the Son of GOD: for, <hi>A Prophet</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) will the Lord your God raiſe up unto you, in all things like unto me, and him ſhall you hear: and it ſhall come to paſs, that whoſoever ſhall not hear him, ſhall be cut off from amongſt the people.</hi> Now neither the Son of God, nor none of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples nor Apoſtles did ever take Tythes, or ever command the paying of them: and they were not perſons ordained by the will of man, but were anointed with the holy anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and were, by that Spirit that did anoint them, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to feed the Flock of Chriſt, over which the holy
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:172640:59"/>
Ghoſt had made them Overſeers. And Chriſt himſelf ſaith, That <hi>unleſs a man be born again, he cannot enter into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven.</hi> And this new Birth is a Death unto all ſin, and a Life unto all Righteouſneſs: and this every man muſt feel, That it is as natural for him to ſerve the Law of God, as it was formerly to ſerve the Law of ſin. And he is the true Teacher that is able by his own Experience to tell ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther how he hath paſſed from Death to Life: for no unclean thing can enter the Kingdom: for without are Covetous, Lyers, Adulterers, Drunkards, Extortioners, and all evil Doers.</p>
            <p>Now a true Teacher muſt hate the very appearance of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil; he muſt hate vain thoughts, and every falſe way. We ſhall finde in Scripture, that all the Teachers of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs were ſuch as were filled with the Spirit of the Lord, and did not preach for filthy lucre or gain, but of a ready minde, and were not as the Prieſts of theſe times are, that lie as Thieves and Robbers, to murder in the way, and ſue for tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Damages, and perſecute the Son of God in all thoſe that deſire to live godly in him: which they will feel one day, that thoſe that perſecute them, they perſecute him: and it were better that a milſtone were hanged about his neck, and he thrown into the ſea, then that he ſhould offend one of thoſe little Ones that put their truſt in me, ſaith Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now I finde that in the year 600. or ſoon after, <hi>Gregory</hi> the Firſt, then Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſent over <hi>Auguſtine</hi> the Monk into <hi>England;</hi> by vvhom <hi>Ethelbert</hi> King of <hi>Kent</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted: This <hi>Auguſtine</hi> vvas a C<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>In the year 786. two Legats were ſent over from Pope <hi>Hadrian</hi> the Firſt, to <hi>Offa</hi> King of <hi>Mercland, Alwolf</hi> King of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> vvho made a Decree, That the people of thoſe two Kingdoms ſhould pay Tythes: King <hi>Athelſtone</hi> about the year 930.

King <hi>Knute</hi> about the year 1020. <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, and others of the Saxon Kings, by Order from the Pope, made Laws for Tythes. The Normans afterwards entering this Kingdome, <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour, <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, King <hi>Stephen,</hi> and other Kings, by the like Order from the Pope, confirmed the ſaid Laws for Tythes: and yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvithſtanding all theſe Laws, yet vvas it left to the Ovvner to confer it vvhere he pleaſed; vvhich vvas the cauſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo many rich Abbies and Monaſteries in <hi>England:</hi> and until the year 1200. or thereabouts, every one gave their Tythes as they pleaſed; vvhich made Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, ſend his Decretal Epiſtle the Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> commanding him to injoyn every man to pay his Tythes to thoſe that miniſtred ſpiritual things to them; which vvas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by Sentence of the Eccleſiaſtical Courts.

doth lie upon them, and woes will be upon them if they do it not, if they do the work of the Lord negligently: and they are ready to ſacrifice their lives, and to ſeal the truth of their Miniſtry with their blood, that they may finiſh their work with Joy and inward Conſolation, which is full of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and great glory; and their Converſations are without Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs, they ſeek not their ovvn, but the things of Jeſus, the ſalvation of all men, that they may live the life of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; as they have been ſervants unto ſin, ſo, that they may novv come to be <hi>made free from ſin, and have their lives in holineſs and righteouſneſs, the end whereof, is everlasting life:</hi> for the gift of grace is free; <hi>and ſo many as receive him, to them he gives power to become the Sons of God, even to all thoſe that do believe in his name:</hi> and their converſations are in heaven; and they do not minde earthly things; and they do the works of the Spirit, vvhich doth make them alive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God: for <hi>as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God;</hi> and they are as Lights in the midſt of a perverſe and crooked Generation: and they are holy, harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, vvithout ſpot and blemiſh, vvaiting vvith Oyl in their own Lamps, for the coming of the Lord, that they may enter into his Joy, and receive the end of their faith, which is, the ſalvation of their ſouls.</p>
            <p>The true Miniſters of Chriſt, they were filled with the Holy Ghoſt, before they went forth; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, when Chriſt had revealed himſelf in him, then he ſpake the word with boldneſs: and many of the Prieſts ſay, That <hi>Judas</hi> had a Commiſſion, as well as the reſt of the Apoſtles, becauſe <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſent them forth, and ſaid, <hi>As you go, preach; and ſay, The Kingdom of God is at hand;</hi> vvhich Kingdom was the pouring down of the Spirit of Righteouſneſs, vvhich he promiſed that the holy Ghoſt ſhould come down, and abide with them for ever, and lead them into all truth. But there is not one Text that ever I could find, that they did go forth until the lot fell upon <hi>Matthias</hi> in the room of <hi>Judas,</hi> and he was numbered amongſt the twelve. It is ſaid, That <hi>the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty returned, and ſaid, Behold, Lord, the devils are ſubject
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:172640:61"/>
unto us.</hi> So at the beſt, thoſe Prieſts that pleads for <hi>Judas,</hi> doth but derive their Office from him: for he was a Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at the beſt: and ſo are all they that have not received the holy Ghoſt: for the Apoſtles were to feed the Flock of Chriſt, over which the holy Ghoſt hath made them Overſeers, and the Prieſts of this Generation, are they not proud, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, arrogant, ambitious, ſelf-lovers, lovers of pleaſures more then lovers of God, having a form of Godlineſs, but denying the power thereof?</p>
            <p>Where is the man or the woman that hath been at any time ſnatcht out of the paws of Satan, and out of the ſnares of hell, by their Miniſtry, as it is called? Where is the fruits of the holy Ghoſt to be found amongſt their hearers, which is, Love, Joy, Meekneſs, Temperance, Brothetly kindeneſs, Bowels of Compaſſion, enduring all things, Temperance, Righteouſneſs, and holy in all manner of converſation? Is not the fruits of their hearers clean contrary? are they not wrath, anger, malice, murder, robbery, plunder, a neater word for Thieves, Swearing, Adultery, Fornication, and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſs, ſcoffing, deſpiſing thoſe that are good, heady, high-minded, diſobedient to parents, unnatural, truce-break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Covenant-breakers?</p>
            <p>And by this it appears, that they neither have the call of Chriſts Miniſters: for if the Lord had ſent them, they ſhould have turned people from the evil of their doings, and they ſhould have learned to do well: neither have they the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of Chriſts Miniſters, nor the fruits of Chriſts Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: for Chriſts Miniſters, they were commanded to take nothing with them, neither money, nor ſtaff, nor ſcrip; and they were to enquire who was worthy, and there enter, and there eat ſuch things as was ſet before them, and that was their maintenance: not to force people, and take away their Goods, three times as much as was or could be demanded. And the fruits of Chriſts Miniſters: <hi>Peter</hi> converted three thouſand at once; and many thouſands now, bleſſed be the holy Name of the ever-living GOD, are eſcaped out of the ſnare of the hunter, by the ſounding forth of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Goſpel of ſalvation from his true Miniſters, who are

deſpiſed, and ſcornfully called, by the ſeed of evil doers, <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers:</hi> whoſe Doctrine is, To turn people to the light within them, which doth bring them out of Rebellion, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient nature, which the light doth reprove and condemn; and they that do draw from the teachings of Chriſt within, ſuch the Light Chriſt doth ſhew to be ſeducers, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. 26, 27. and this light doth bring into the holy life, and into the pure worſhip of God in the Spirit.</p>
            <p>And therefore I do dearly exhort you from the Lord, to come out of all your falſe Churches, your falſe ways, and from your proud deceitful Prieſts; and come to Chriſt the true Paſtor and Biſhop of your ſouls; and ſo you ſhall come to the Church that is in God, 1 <hi>Theſ. 1. 1. Heb.</hi> 12. 22, 23. whoſe Overſeers are made by the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>And ſo dear Friends I do dearly exhort you to take heed to that which is pure of God in your conſciences, and obey it, and make that your Teacher: for that calls for a pure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 13, 14, 15, 16. and let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works: and ſo you ſhall all come to be baptized into Chriſt, and ſo put him on, by one Spirit, and come to be buried with him in the true Baptiſm, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1, 2. and ſo a fellowſhip into the new life cometh to be witneſſed, where there is one Faith, one Lord, and one Baptiſm; and ſo one God and Father of them all: and ſo they are kept in that Church which is the pillar and ground of Truth, <hi>Epheſ. 4. 4, 5, 6, 7. 2 Tim. 2. 19. 1 Tim. 3. 15. Mat.</hi> 11. 28. Chriſt calleth all that are weary and heavy laden, to come unto him, and he will give: them reſt.</p>
            <p>And therefore obey the light, and come out from your ſins, take up the croſs, and deny your wills, and forſake your ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, and touch not the unclean thing, and he will receive you; and take heed you do not reject the counſel of the Lord God, who deſires to bring you to ſalvation: for, <hi>the viſion is but for an appointed time:</hi> and, <hi>the Lords Spirit ſhall not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes ſtrive with man.</hi>

               <p>To all Drunkards, Swearers, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurers, Extortioners, Adulterers, and all unclean Perſons, ſhewing the heavy Wrath of the living God burneth like fire againſt ſuch evil Perſons, and the terrible day of Vengeance is at hand: And theſe are to warn them, that they ſpeedily repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their hearts come to be ript up, and laid naked before the mighty and terrible GOD, who doth regard no mans Perſon in Judgement, but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one ſhall receive according to the things done in his Body, whether they be good or evil.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Light that diſcovers ſin, is Chriſt; and when any evil is committed, Gods witneſs in the conſcience is diſturbed, the juſt ſeed lyeth oppreſſed, and then the ſoul lieth under the wrath of God: and who can dwell in his Diſpleaſure?</p>

And the many ſad Judgements that have befallen perſons in that condition of drunkenneſs, I think, ſhould deter per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from that accurſed beaſtly ſin, which maketh men, that they are like unto the ſwine, as you may ſee in 2 <hi>Sam. 13. 28.

            <p>Another preſident you may ſee in 1 <hi>King. 16. 8, 9, 10. In the ſix and twentieth year of Aſa king of Judah, began Elah the ſon of Baaſha to reign over Iſrael in Tirzah, and reigned two years. And his ſervant Zimri (captain of half his chariots) conſpired againſt him as he was in Tirzah, drinking till he was drunk in the houſe of Arza, ſteward of his houſe in Tirzah. And Zimri came and ſmote him, and killed him in the twenty and ſeventh year of Aſa king of Judah, and reigned in his ſtead.</hi>

               <hi>David</hi> made <hi>

            <p>We ought not to keep company with Drunkards, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23. 20, 21. The wo of the Lord of hoſts, the God of Iſrael, is pronounced againſt Drunkards, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5. 11. VVo vnto them that riſe up early, to follow Drunkenneſs, and to them that continue until night, till the wine doth inflame them: for they regard not the work of the Lord, neither conſider the works of his hands.</p>
            <p>Many more Texts of Scripture might be quoted, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Examples of Gods Judgements againſt ſuch ſinners to my own knowledge: as, ſome that have fallen into wells, and been drowned; ſome into the <hi>Thames;</hi> ſome have broke their Necks off their horſes; ſome their Legs, their Arms;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:172640:63"/>
ſides waſting their pretious time, that God hath put into their hands to get wiſdom, and alſo ruining their wives and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in waſting and conſuming their Eſtates: for a Drunken man is fit to do any wickedneſs, &amp; to act any ungodlineſs: and this ſad ſin is many times committed by peoples drinking of Healths: the Devil ſtealeth upon them, and if he can get them to drink Healths, he hath them ſafe enough: for of whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever a man is overcome, his ſervant he is, to whom he is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome; whether it be of ſin unto death, or of obedience unto Righteouſneſs: ſo he that is overcome by ſin, is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils ſlave.</p>
            <p>And verily, my ſoul doth mourn in ſecret, and my heart doth bleed within me, and ſorrow doth over-whelm me, for ſome of my dearly beloved Friends, that are overtaken by Satans ſnares in this way of ſinning: and therefore my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is to them from the Lord, that they would mind the light of Chriſt in their Conſciences, which is, Gods witneſs for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and it will either excuſe or accuſe, acquit or condemne: and this being ſilently and patiently waited in, will teach the denying the drinking of healths; and will be a means to keep out of this beaſtly ſin, that makes perſons like Beaſts, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces the Image of God, and defiles his Temple; and ſuch, if they do not ſpeedily repent, the Lord will deſtroy them: for he that defiles the Temple of God, him will God deſtroy. And your Bodies are the Temples of the holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p>And next to this is Swearers: for becauſe of Oaths the Land mourneth: and, The curſe ſhall enter into the houſe of the Swearer, and conſume it, even with the beams and tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thereof. And what a company of ſad creatures there is, that will ſwear any thing for advantage, in buying and ſelling in their ordinary courſe of trading in the world, between man and man! how for ſix pence, many times, they will ſell their Faith! O let ſuch fear, and tremble, and repent: for without heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> are all ſwearers, drunkards, and all Lyers, who have their portion in the lake that burneth with fire and Brimſtone.</p>
            <p>And the ſin of accuſtoming a mans ſelf to ſwearing, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved,

               <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 23. 9. to 24. &amp; 17. 14. and Chriſt Jeſus gave this command to all that then were and ſhould be, <hi>Swear not at all,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: and all Controverſies may be ended without ſwearing, if the Magiſtrates would come to the line of true judgement, and be guided by the witneſs of God in them.</p>
            <p>And therefore dear Friends, leave off this wicked cuſtome of vain ſwearing: for it neither profiteth the ſpeaker nor hearer; but ſerveth the Devil, and bringeth everlaſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to the ſoul.</p>
            <p>And there is a great and moſt abominable ſin committed in and by many, that they eat up Gods people like bread, they devour them by Extortion and Uſury: but ſuch muſt not come to the holy Hill of <hi>Sion.</hi> VVo to them that get fields and houſes by violence and oppreſſion, and devour the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs and the widdow: They are far from the commands of Chriſt, which ſaith, <hi>Lend, looking for nothing again:</hi> it is a ſin forbidden amongſt the Jews, <hi>Exod. 20. 17. &amp; 22. 25.

            <p>And therefore my deſire, yea, my ſouls deſire unto all is, That they would keep their mindes out of fading, viſible, periſhing things: for none but ſuch have their hearts upon the inviſible God, who is a Spirit; and none but ſpiritual worſhippers do ſerve him, or honour him; even ſuch the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeeketh to worſhip him, that worſhip him in the Spirit and in Truth; and ſuch feel their lives to be in God, and they live by Faith, which Faith is the Faith of Gods Elect: for

they that ſo come to live, dayly do they feel the flowings in of comfort, from the well-ſpring of Life; and they grow like Trees that are planted by the Rivers of VVaters, that do bring forth Fruit in due ſeaſon, whoſe Leaf ſhall not fade, and whatſoever they do, it ſhall proſper; and the Lord refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth their ſouls with fatneſs, and giveth them the bread of life, that they eat, and live for ever; and they drink of that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that they never thirſt: and they taſte of that heavenly Rock, which is Chriſt: and they are the tender Lambs of Chriſt: and the Lord God doth eſteem of them as his Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els; and they that touch them, touch the Apple of Gods Eye: <hi>For they are they that do overcome the world, and they ſhall be cloathed in white, and they ſhall follow the Lamb whitherſoever he goeth, and ſing ſongs of Triumph; Glory, Glory, everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory and Hallelujahs be given to him that is Lord of lords, and King of kings, that is the God that giveth his people light, and in his light they ſee the everlasting Light, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth them live for evermore in his preſence, where there is the fulneſs of joy, and at whoſe right hand are pleaſures for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.</hi>

            </argument>
            <p>DEar Hearts, my dearly beloved in the light and love of God, for whom my ſoul travelleth in birth, that I might ſee Chriſt formed in you, that you might <hi>walk worthy of the Lord, unto all well-pleaſing; being fruitful in every good work, and increaſing in the knowledge of God, ſtrengthned with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience, and long-ſuffering, with joyfulneſs; giving thanks to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light; who hath delivered us from the power of darkneſs, and hath tranſlated us into the Kingdom of his dear Son; in whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveneſs of ſins: who is the image of the inviſible God, the firſt born of every creature: for it pleaſed the Father, that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo dear Hearts, as you wait in him out of all viſible things, wherein your life hath formerly been nouriſhed and upheld, you ſhall (by Chriſt) witneſs a new birth, and a new nature; and the life of God will be felt and witneſſed, which doth redeem the ſoul out of ſin, and of inquity, and doth reach the ſeed of God, which is pure, and of his fulneſs, of whom we receive grace for grace: and ſo the pure innocent ſeed of the Lord ſpringeth up in you, that you become fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Branches, and bring forth much fruit unto the Lord; and ſo every one in their ſeveral meaſure, anſwer the Lords ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation: who is this day ſeeking for fruits amongſt his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and all dead fruitleſs Trees muſt have the Ax laid to the

            <p>And therefore, dear Hearts, be diligent and watchful, that in the ſtrength of God, you may be continually armed againſt the old devouring Enemy, Satan; who goeth about like a roaring Lyon: and all his War is againſt the tender Lambs of Chriſts fold; that he may make Rents and Diviſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them: but you are commanded to reſiſt him, being ſtedfaſt in the Faith, &amp; always to let your works and labour to abound in the Lord, for as much as you knovv your labour is not in vain in the Lord: and this know, that Satan will do what he may or poſſibly can againſt you: he had ſought to winnow <hi>Peter</hi> as Wheat was winnowed in a ſieve: he tempted Chriſt, but there was no ground for him to enter in him. And thoſe that are renewed in the ſpirit of their mindes in Chriſt, they pluck up and plow up the fallow ground of their hearts, they pluck up ſin by the roots; they remove the ground, that there is no room to receive the devils temptations, although he ſtrives to the utmoſt of his power to keep the ſeed of God in bondage; which ſeed is Gods Elect and Precious, and he will redeem it out of captivity and thraldome: for it is the Reſurrection, and the holy Birth, the Beloved, the incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, that deſtroyes Satans kingdom: and therefore love it, and nouriſh it, and cheriſh it, and let it have the whole domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in you, and it will totally put out Satan, and you ſhall tread him under your feet: for where the ſeed of God doth reign, there Satan is ſubjected: and ſo in the light of God you will finde ſtrength, and power, and dominion over the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie, and over all his ſleights and deceits.</p>
            <p>As you ſtand in the light, which is the power of God, the Enemy will find no place to enter, and his ſtrength will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated and decreaſed, and then you will, by degrees, find your bodies fit Temples for the holy Ghoſt to dwell in, and the ſtrength of the Lord God of Life and Glory will dayly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed unto you; and in his ſtrength you ſhall walk, until you appear before him in <hi>Sion:</hi> and you ſhall obtain victory over
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:172640:66"/>
the Enemy of your ſouls, and know the glorious liberty of the Sons of God, and ſo come to have a portion and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance with the Babes of Chriſt, even an <hi>everlaſting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance reſerved in heaven for you,</hi> in that Kingdom which hath no end; and even ſuch glory as no eye hath ſeen, nor ear hath heard, nor tongue is able to expreſs, which God hath laid up for them that love him: What hath not eye ſeen? what hath not ear heard? and the heart is able to conceive more then all, yea, it is able to conceive and entertain into the imagination any thing; yet all this is nothing to thoſe everlaſting joyes, and comforts, and conſolations, which the Saints ſhall enjoy in the preſence of the Lord for evermore. And therefore faint not at your fiery trials, which cometh, or is admitted, or ſuffered in the Wiſdom that is Infinite, to try you, as if ſome ſtrange thing were come unto you, as you may ſee in 1 <hi>Pet. 4. 12, 13. But rejoyce, in as much as you are partakers of Chriſts ſufferings, that when his glory ſhall be revealed, you may be glad alſo, with exceeding joy: if you be reproached for the Name of Chriſt, happy are you: for the Spirit of God and of glory reſteth upon you: on their parts he is evil ſpoken of, but on your parts he is glorified: for the time is come, that judgement must begin at the houſe of God: and if it firſt begin at us, what ſhall the end be of them that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey not the Goſpel of God? and if the righteous ſcarcely be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, where ſhall the ungodly and the ſinner appear?

            </p>
            <p>And ſo dear hearts, look not out at things paſt, preſent, or to come, or at others, but ſtand in the light, and in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of the Lord, and freely give up to his will, as <hi>Job</hi> did: <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he kill me,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>yet will I truſt in him.</hi> And in the Lords due time, there ſhall be deliverance out of all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and he will work your peace, even peace that men and devils ſhall not take from you: <hi>for he that keepeth Iſrael, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſlumbereth nor ſleepeth:</hi> and although <hi>many are the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of the Righteous,</hi> yet <hi>the Lord will deliver them out of them all.</hi> And therefore caſt your whole care upon the Lord, and

truſt in him, and he ſhall bring it to paſs: he ſhall bring forth your Righteouſneſs as clear as the light, and your juſt deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as the noon day: and ſo the power of the Lord will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs you about, and his Angels ſhall have charge concerning you, to keep you in all his ways: for they that ſtay themſelves upon the arm of the Lord, have perfect peace; and their ſtrength ſhall be renewed day by day in him, who is made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and is become the Author of eternal ſalvation to all them that obey him; which is <hi>Jeſus, that ſaveth to the utmoſt all that come to God by him: for he ever liveth to make interceſſion for them.</hi> And ſo believe in him, and you ſhall be ſaved: <hi>For Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs, to every one that believeth: For Moſes deſcribeth the righteouſneſs which is of the Law, that the man which doth them, ſhall live by them: but the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which is of faith ſpeaketh on this wiſe, Say not in thy heart, Who ſhall aſcend into heaven? that is, to bring Christ down from above; or who ſhall aſcend into the deep? that is, to bring Chriſt back again from the dead. But what ſaith it? The Word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and in thy heart; that is, the Word of Faith which we preach; which teacheth to deny all ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and worldly luſt, and to live godly, ſoberly, and righteouſly in this preſent evil world; and to do injury to no man, but to do unto all men, as you would have all men do unto you: even this the Lord thy God doth require of thee, O man, To do juſtly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God.</hi> And this walking with God, is that way that <hi>Enoch</hi> vvalked in, &amp; all the holy men of God that brought their ſouls to the true centre of Reſt, even Reſt everlaſting, where there is the innumerable company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and the firſt-born, whoſe names are written in heaven, in the book of Life. And ſo dear hearts, indure, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did, all things patiently, as ſeeing him that is inviſible: for the patient abiding of the Meek ſhall not be forgotten: and the Lord bottles up all the tears of his redeemed ones: and ſo every one come with patience to do the will of God, that when you have done it, you may receive the Reward: and ſo every one come to feel Chriſt Jeſus, in you that believe, the hope of glory; and feed upon the living Goſpel, which is the bread of life, that whoſoever eateth, hungreth no more:
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:172640:67"/>
for every one muſt come to poſſeſs Chriſt in their own hearts: for it is the Oyl in a mans own Lamp, that muſt convey him into the Bridegrooms Chamber, where the fulneſs of life and joy is to be found, poſſeſſed, and enjoyed: for unto ſuch, who ordereth their converſations aright, will Chriſt ſay at laſt, <hi>Come you bleſſed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundations of the world:</hi> for thoſe that be guided by Chriſt, are ſuch as hear his voice, and do deſire to be taught by him, as the truth is in Jeſus; and they ſhall be guided by him to do the will of God in every thing, and ſo they ſhall come to be filled with his Righteouſneſs, and ſo his Righteouſneſs filleth them with everlaſting glory: and the pure broken heart that is contrite, the Lord doth accept.</p>
            <p>And ſo let all Rulers and Magiſtrates ceaſe the naming of God, until they part from evil: and let them ceaſe their medling with ſetling the things of Gods Kingdom; for I have ſeen they have all been broken to pieces as ſoon as they go about that work: for the Lord will do his work him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: by his Spirit and by his power it ſhall be accompliſhed; and it ſhall not be in the power of man to hinder: but he will break the great Potſherds of the earth to pieces, if they meddle with thoſe things that concern the ſetling of his Kingdom. And therefore in render love to their ſouls, I dearly exhort them to ſettle their own Governments, and their own Kingdoms, which are of this world; and let Chriſt alone with the ſetling of his Kingdom, which is not of this world: for a Spirit of Righteouſneſs ſhall rule and reign in the earth, as the ſpirit of wickedneſs hath done: and although the devil doth roar, yet the time is at hamd when this ſhall be: and it ſhall not be in the power of man to hinder it.</p>
            <p>And therefore give over ſtriving againſt the ſtream, you mighty Potentates of the world: for <hi>it is hard for you to kick againſt the pricks: For the great day of the Lord is at hand, and all mens works ſhall be tryed with fire: and in that day, the great and mighty men ſhall cry to the mountains and the hills, to fall upon them, and hide them from his preſence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore all lend their ear to this call to Repentance, while the day of their ſalvation laſteth; and whilſt the Lord
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:172640:67"/>
ſtandeth at the door of your hearts, knocking, let him in: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member what Chriſt ſaid to <hi>Jeruſalem: Jeruſalem, O Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, thou that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them that are ſent unto thee! how often would I have gathered you as a hen ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth her chickens under her wings! and ye would not.</hi> But her calamity came of a ſudden: and ſo let her be an Example for you, ſpeedily to repent, and put away the evil of your do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well; for fear the wrath of the Lord deſtroy you: for the time was, when all the Kings of the earth would not have believed that the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary ſhould have entered the gates of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and all the inhabitants of the world would not have believed that the Enemy ſhould have entered the gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for the ſins of her Prophets and of her Prieſts; which were full of iniquity, as the Prieſts of <hi>England</hi> are, who have ſhed the blood of the Juſt in the midſt of her. And therefore wo, wo to thee, O <hi>England,</hi> if thou doſt not ſpeedily repent, and put away the evil of thy doings: for <hi>the Lord deſireth not the death of a ſinner, but that he may live.</hi> Therefore <hi>turn ye, turn ye: for why will you die, O houſe of Iſrael?</hi> And come to be within the promiſe of the Elect of God: for the Lord lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his ſaints, and he preſerveth the faithful, and mercy ſhall embrace them on every ſide: <hi>For he is nigh to them that are of a broken heart, and he ſaveth them that are of a contrite ſpirit:</hi> therefore <hi>bleſſed are the people whoſe God is the Lord, the people who he hath choſen for his own inheritance: for the eye of the Lord is over them, to preſerve them, and to keep them in all their wayes, and to preſerve them in famine; and thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands ſhall fall before them, and the plague ſhall not come neer them: for the deſtroying Angels ſhall paſs over their heads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore all dear hearts fear the living GOD, who is a God of power, and he is dreadful to all the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; but a God of love, and joy, and conſolation to all thoſe that fear him, and that delight in his Commandments, to do them. Therefore fear the living God, and wait upon him, that you may finde pure wiſdom flow in upon you, from on high: <hi>For every good and perfect gift cometh down from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, from the Father of lights,</hi> who doth powerfully mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:172640:68"/>
himſelf unto his Babes and Children, and doth flow from heaven with freſh diſcoveries of his love unto his bel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ved Ones, that they can ſay feelingly, <hi>Their beloved is their and they are his:</hi> and he draws them by the cords of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing love, that they are refreſhed at the well-ſpring of life.</p>
            <p>And therefore return, return: forſake your idol-ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds, and embrace Chriſt, which is the Light: for he is the true Shepherd and Biſhop of your ſouls, in whom the ſure mercies of <hi>David</hi> are enjoyed, and the glory of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is witneſſed; even the free Covenant of light, in which the true Prophets did ſtand, who is the Rock of Ages, and is the Light of the World, and is perfect Righteouſneſs; and they that are in him, are righte us by his Righteouſneſs: for he hath for ever perfected all thoſe that are ſanctified: and he commandeth his to be holy as he is holy, and pure as he is pure: and, <hi>Be ye perfect</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>as your Father which is in heaven is perfect:</hi> and the Croſs of Chriſt is the mighty power of God unto ſalvation, unto every one that believeth: <hi>And by this</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>ſhall you appear to be my Diſciples, by taking up the croſs dayly, and following me:</hi> and Gods wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in every man will ſhew him the Croſs of Chriſt, what it is: for that will ſhew all thoſe that are faithful to it, what is the will of God in every thing: for it is that pure Thing of God in man, that never did conſent to ſin, nor never will, but ſhews man all that ever he did: and ſo we may ſay, with the woman, <hi>Come, ſee a man that hath told me all that ever I have done: Is not this the Chriſt?</hi> ſaid ſhe.</p>
            <p>And ſo, dear Hearts, this is your true Teacher, <hi>Emmanuel, God with us:</hi> and the Lord is a ſtrong Towet, the Righteous fly unto it, and are ſafe: and they are hid in that inviſible life which is in God: and they know the life of God: and they walk in his dayly preſence, and the arm of his ſtrength is revealed dayly unto them, which bringeth ſalvation.</p>
            <p>And therefore come off from all your Idol ſhepherds, and from all your falſe Forms of worſhip unto the Lord, who is bringing his people off from the barren Mountains, where they have fed upon husks and chaff: and he is become their <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>cher himſelf, and he will feed them with the fineſt of the
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:172640:68"/>
Wheat, and they ſhall drink of the well-ſpring of Life, and never thirſt again: and they ſhall finde, that one day in his Courts, is better then a thouſand elſewhere.</p>
            <p>Now the Prieſts muſt know, That an old Maſs-houſe is not the Courts of God: for the Church of Chriſt is the Pillar and Ground of Truth: and as many as were baptized, were baptized into Chriſt: and, <hi>They that are in Chriſt, are new creatures: old things are paſſed away; all things are become new:</hi> and, <hi>Your Bodies are the Temples of the holy Ghoſt: and him that defiles the Temple of God, him will God deſtroy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo dear Friends, and Brethren, and Siſters, and Fathers, and all You that do fear the Lord, Take heed <hi>how</hi> you hear, and take heed <hi>whom</hi> you hear: for I do ſee dangerous ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and deceivers abroad in the world, beſides the Prieſts; even ſuch as the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaketh of, that even would beguile the ſaints out of their ſimplicity, if they could, even as the ſerpent beguiled <hi>Eve;</hi> ſuch as have <hi>eyes full of adultery, beguiling unſtable ſouls, hearts exerciſed with covetous practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; having forſaken the right way, and gone aſtray, following the way of Balaam the ſon of Boſor, which loved the wages of unrighteouſneſs: theſe are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a tempeſt; to whom the miſt of darkneſs is reſerved for ever:</hi> For when they ſpeak great ſwelling words, in the Name of the Lord, they allure through the luſts of the fleſh, through much wantonneſs, thoſe who were clean eſcaped from them who live in Errour: while they promiſe them Liberty, <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 span">
