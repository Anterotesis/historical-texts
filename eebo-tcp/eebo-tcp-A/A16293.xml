         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe the ſame is paſſed longe tyme, it is lykewyſe true that the daye of the lorde approcheth, that the Empyre is come to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Almains.

By this it is euident and clere, that the victories come of God, and that the Romayne Monarchye ſhalbe the laſte, and ſhall not be vanquyſſhed, deſtroyed, nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſed, then only of God, and by the Roialme of Ieſus Chriſt. Dyuers haue attempted to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerte the ſame, pryncypallye the Turkes, the whiche (albeit they haue obteyned certayne vycto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryes agaynſte Themperoure) yet ſhall not this laſt Monarchi be put in ſubiection, nor broken, as by longe experyence it hath ben hytherto approued: but it

Fyrſte we wyll ſet forth the wordes of Elie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Iewes confounde them ſelues, which haue ſet fourth (as they ſaye) howe the worlde ſhall endure ſyxe thouſande yeares, that is to ſaye, two thouſande yeares without lawe, two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſande
<pb facs="tcp:21320:22"/>
yeares with the lawe, and two thouſande yeares after the dayes of Chriſte. To theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des it ſemeth Saynt Peter con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fyrmeth in his ſeconde epiſtle in the thyrd chapitre, ſayinge that one daye to the Lorde is as a M, yeres, and a thouſand yeres as one day. Of the lyke that fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth, that as the Lorde in ſyx dayes created al, and the vij. day he repoſed him ſelf, lykewiſe ſixe m. yeres he gouerned this worl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, ſubiect to generations &amp; cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, &amp; in the. vii, M. he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne repoſe perpetual, &amp; as the ſyxt day was not in all permyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to worke and trauayle, but that a good part of the ſame day drawynge towardes euenynge was laide to the ſaboth, likewiſe the ſixte thouſande ſhall not be holye ſuffred nor graunted as it is wrytten in other paſſage that
<pb facs="tcp:21320:22"/>
the Lorde ſhall abrydge y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dayes for the choſen, as the ſixe firſt ge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nerations, that is to ſay, of Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, Seth, Iared, Cainan, Malaleel &amp; Iared, be treſpaſſed or depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the ſeuenth whiche is of Enoch, is immortall, Lykewyſe ſixe thouſande yeares ſhall rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate death, &amp; in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſeuenth ſhall haue the fortunate immortalitie, his vigour. Item in S. Math .xxiiij. S. Marke .xiij. ſayth the Lord, of this daye and houre no creature knoweth, nor yet thau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelles of heauen, but my father onlye.

By theſe wordes it ſemeth Ieſus Chryſt to haue taken not onlye the ſimilitude of the qualitie, but alſo of the quantitye of thynges, I call qualities manners of this corrupted worlde, wherof there is no doubte, for S.

The ſentence is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more obſcure, but Saynt Mathewe declareth it, when he ſayth: Lykewiſe as the dayes of Noe were, ſo ſhalbe the cominge of the ſonne of man. And Saynt Paule to the Romaynes in the v. Chapter, affyrmeth how Ada<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> was the fourme and figure of the commynge of Ieſu Chriſt.

                  <pb facs="tcp:21320:24"/>There is other that ſaye how the yeares of the Lord ought to be accompted, not from his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyuytye: but from his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on, Aſcencion, or ſendynge of his holye ſpyryte, whyche ſhoulde make greate variation and mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacion of the yeares.
