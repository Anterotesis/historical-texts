            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

ESME STUART,
Earl of March, and Darneley, Lord Leighton &amp;c.
Son and Heir to the Illustrious
JAMES
Duke of Richmond and Lennox.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Onsulting with my self about a <hi>Patron</hi> for
this <hi>Book,</hi> I concluded to make choice of
such a Person as should be both of most
noble extraction, and of spotless innocency:
So that in this captious Age, none should presume to charge
him with the least offence in <hi>thought, word, or deed.</hi> For
justly fearing too many faults might be found in the book
it self, I desired to make some amends by dedicating it
to One free from all exception.</p>
            <p>Your Honour is the first in our Nobility, whom I
finde qualified according to my desire; descended from the
<pb facs="tcp:48509:4"/>
best Houses in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> And
as it happeneth in a <hi>Constellation,</hi> that the <hi>Lustre</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
amounting from many Stars together, darkeneth the <hi>light</hi>
of those particulars, which produced it: So in your <hi>Honours</hi>
Pedegree, the <hi>collective splendour</hi> obscureth the <hi>distinct
brightness</hi> of those <hi>severall families</hi> whence the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulteth.</p>
            <p>Now that your Honour cannot be taxed with any actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
offence, your tender Moneths not as yet compleating a
Year; do sufficiently evidence. Whose innocence is the most
entire Relique of our Primitive integrity; and most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
pattern of our future felicity. Yea some admiring
what motives to mirth Infants meet with in their silent
and solitary smiles, have resolved (how truely I know not)
that then they converse with <hi>Angels,</hi> as indeed such cannot
amongst mortals finde any fitter Companions.</p>
            <p>One, or more of these three main Ends are aimed at by
Authors in all ingenuous dedications; Hope to receive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection;
Desire to derive instruction; and Zeal to express
affection.</p>
            <p>For the first, though you cannot by your <hi>Power,</hi> yet you may
by your <hi>Innocence</hi> be an excellent <hi>Patron</hi> to protect our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing
Work. In these civill wars, some have saved themselves
from the sword, with no other shield then bearing a <hi>Babe</hi> in
their armes, which rebated their enemies fury into compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.
So, when some shall be ready to wound our Book with
their censuring Darts, they will be mollified into mercy finding
your innocent Name prefixed in the Front thereof.</p>
            <p>As for <hi>deriving instruction,</hi> I confess your Honour as yet
incapable thereof. But seeing Infants clothes are providently
<pb facs="tcp:48509:4"/>
made with the biggest, to which they will grow up in process of
time; why may not books (the clothes of the minde) be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
above their present capacity, in hope they will seaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably
shoot up to the understanding thereof? And untill such
time as your Lordships judgment can reap profit from our <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scriptions</hi>
herein, may your eyes but take pleasure in the <hi>Maps</hi>
which here are presented unto you.</p>
            <p>But the last, not least consideration in my choice of your
Honour, is my ambition to tender my humble service thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;

               </note> your auspicious Name
promiseth, in my apprehension, some good success, now at the
<hi>third return,</hi> as long since at the <hi>first imposing</hi> thereof on
your <hi>Ancestour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Esme</hi> Lord Aulbigney (a place of great priviledges in
the Province of <hi>Berry,</hi> first by the King of <hi>France</hi> bestowed
on [and still possessed by] your Family, in reward of their signal
service to that Crown) about two hundred years since proved
the happy reviver of your family almost extinguished for want
of a Heir, and by his virtuous demeanour added much honour
thereunto.</p>
            <p>The same Name now returns on your Lordship, who found
your Fathers house in point of posterity in as low a Condition.
Indeed your Grandfather left a numerous off-spring, whom I
may fitly compare to the <hi>many strings</hi> of some <hi>musicall</hi> Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
But amongst his male-issue (for the rest I pass by as <hi>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent strings,</hi> sending no <hi>sounds</hi> to posterity, but losing their own
<hi>Surnames</hi> in their matches) One was soon <hi>fretted</hi> in pieces with
sickness; Three more, <hi>cut off</hi> in these wars; One absent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the Seas, and not easily to be <hi>tuned</hi> to a married estate; and
the other <hi>single string</hi> remaining [<hi>His Grace</hi> your Father] left
<pb facs="tcp:48509:5"/>
altogether issueless untill your Lordships welcome Nativity.</p>
            <p>But O! what melody can Heavens hand make on a <hi>Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chord?</hi>
which since hath sent your Lordship on a good message I
hope, to the <hi>Honest house of</hi> LENNOX.</p>
            <p>But I grow tedious in a long Letter to a little Lord, and
therefore turn my Pen into Prayers, that Christ would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
to take you <hi>up into his Armes,</hi> (whose embraces are the best
swadling-clothes, as to streighten, so to strengthen you in the

<hi>Laban</hi> the Custome of the Countrey, that it is not fashionable <hi>to<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 19. 26.</note> give the younger

of more ancient date, ought to precede the other, yet this, like <hi>Labans</hi> answer, will

               </gap>, then solid satisfaction.</p>
            <p>But, Reader, let me plead in my just defence, that if you be pleased to peruse my
<note n="b" place="margin">In my Epistle to the Reader before the <hi>Holy State.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>promise,</hi> you will finde the same conditionall, and not obligatory, except (besides
other requisites there expressed) Peace be first setled amongst us. And indeed the
subject challengeth the same, seeing <hi>Truth</hi> cannot be matched to <hi>Safety</hi> in such Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
till <hi>Peace</hi> shall first contract them.</p>
            <p>Now herein I make my severest <hi>Creditour</hi> my sole <hi>Iudge,</hi> appealing to him whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Premises be performed. True it is we have no <hi>Wars</hi> at this instant, yet we
have <hi>Rumours of wars;</hi> and though the former onely doth <hi>destroy,</hi> the latter also
doth <hi>distract.</hi> Are these <hi>gloomy dayes already disclouded?</hi>(to use my own expression
in my<note n="c" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> Promise) or rather is it not true in the Scripture phrase, that the<note n="d" place="margin">Eccles. 12. 2.</note> 
               <hi>clouds return
after rain?</hi> Indeed I am sorry that I can say so much in my own defence, and should
account my self happy, if all other <hi>Breaches</hi> were made up, and I onely to be punished
for my <hi>breach of Promise.</hi> Which, notwithstanding all the difficulties of the subject,
and distractions of our days, I hope in God, in competent time to effect, might but
my endevours meet with a quiet residence, and proportionable incouragement for
such undertakings.</p>
            <p>Mean time accept of these my Labours, which by Gods blessing, and the bounty
of my friends are brought into the light: Usefull I hope for the understanding of the
Scriptures. What I have herein performed, I had rather the Reader should tell me
at the end, then I tell him at the beginning of the Book. For the manifold faults
herein, I doubt not but the ingenuous Reader (finding in <hi>Palestinee</hi> 
               <hi>six Cities of
Refuge,</hi> by Gods own appointment, for the safeguard of such as slew one unawares

pleasing considerations, and delightfull motives, to adventure
on this work, three Giantlike objections, which must be encountred, do
in a manner dishearten me from further proceeding. For some will
lay to my charge, that the description of this Countrey

                     <item>2 Cannot perfectly be done by any.</item>

to enter the lists against them all. For the first: Whereas it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
that many formerly have performed the same; this cavill is not
planted particularly against my inde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>vours, but is levelled against the

                  <hi>Solomon</hi> saith, <hi>there is no
new thing under the Sunne.</hi> Except therefore men were Gods to create
new subjects to write upon, groundlesse is the first exception against us.
It never disheartened S. <hi>Luke</hi> to write his Gospell, <hi>for as much as many had
taken in hand to set it forth before.</hi> Yea the former endevours of many in
the same matter, argue the merit of the work to be great. For sure
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48509:14"/>
there is some extraordinary worth in that face, which hath had so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Suitors. Wherefore although we cannot with <hi>Columbus,</hi> finde out
another world, and bring the first tydings of an unknown Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
or Island, by us discovered, yet our labours ought not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
as unprofitable, if setting forth an old subject in a new edition
enlarged and amended. This I dare say, though many have written
discourses without Mappes, and more Mappes without discourses, and
<note n="c" place="margin">Adricom. <hi>puts</hi> Zabulun Issachar <hi>&amp;</hi> Manasses <hi>in one Mappe,</hi> Ephraim, Dan <hi>&amp;</hi> Benjamin <hi>in another.</hi>
                  </note> some both, (yet so that three tribes are joined in one Mappe) none have
formerly in any tongue (much lesse in English) presented us with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct
Mappes and descriptions together.</p>
               <p>§ 3. But in the second place it is objected,<note place="margin">2. Object.</note> that certainty in this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is unattainable;<note place="margin">Certainty here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</note> so that the most studious therein, after they have
travelled the whole day, through many tedious difficultie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, must bee
fain to take their hard lodging at night on a bare uncertainty. The
bowels of the best Mappes are puffed up with the humours of fancy,
and a scepticall windinesse, so that a conjecturall Earthquake shakes the
foundations of the strongest mountains, in the point of their exact si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.
Such are the irreconcileable differences betwixt Geographers
in their descriptions.</p>
               <p>§ 4. For answer:<note place="margin">2. Answ.</note>
I could wish that this objection also, lay onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst
the work in hand,<note place="margin">This should not quench but quicken our in<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dustry.</note> and might not [almost] equally be enforced
against other liberall undertakings: for he that holds a reed in one hand
to mete the Topography, and an houre-glasse in the other to measure
the Chronology of the Scripture, shall meet with as many, if not more
uncertainties, in the latter as the former. And yet the learned pains
of such-as labour therein, justly merit commendation. If all conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
results should be cast out for weeds, few hearbs would be left in
the Gardens of most Arts and Sciences. Saint <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <note n="d" place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 9.</note> hath a passage, <hi>We
know in part, and prophecy in part;</hi> which is a good curb for our curiosity:
And the same Apostle hath a precept,<note n="e" place="margin">1 Thes. 5. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Prove all things, hold fast that which
is good;</hi> which is as good a spurre for our diligence. As for the differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
betwixt Geographers, they ought not to make us carelesse to follow
any, but carefull to choose the best; except with the fluggards drowzie
fancy, we tune the Alarums to our industry, to be Lullabies to our
lazinesse.</p>
               <p>§ 5. In the last place it is objected,<note place="margin">2. Object.</note> that the designe, if exactly finished,
amounts but to a difficult trifle,<note place="margin">It is a difficult trifle.</note> hard to doe, uselesse when done. And
who will pity the aking of his teeth, who hath wilfully hurt them,
with cracking that shell, wherein he knew was no kernell? It
matters not to any mans salvation, to know the accurate distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Iericho</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and he that hath climbed to the top of mount
<hi>Libanus,</hi> is not in respect of his soul, a haires breadth nearer to heaven.
Besides, some conceive they heare <hi>Palestine</hi> saying unto them, as <hi>Samuel</hi>

                  <hi>Why hast thou disquieted

me to bring me up?</hi> Describing this Countrey is but disturbing it, it being
better to let it sleep quietly, intombed in its owne ashes. The rather,
because the<note n="g" place="margin">Revel. 21. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>New Ierusalem</hi> is now daily expected to come down, and

much to the true understanding of the History of the Bible. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
is that passage of the Apostle, <hi>Acts 17. 26. And hath made of

               </p>
               <p>Our work in hand is a parcell of Geography touching a particular
description of <hi>Iudea;</hi> without some competent skill wherein, as the blind
<hi>Syrians</hi>
                  <note n="h" place="margin">2 King. 6. 19.</note> intending to goe to <hi>Dothan,</hi> went to <hi>Samaria;</hi> so ignorant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
discoursing of the Scripture, must needs make many absurd, and
dangerous mistakes. Nor can knowledge herein, be more speedily and
truly attained, then by particular description of the tribes, where the
eye will learn more in an hour from a Mappe, then the eare can learn
in a day from discourse.</p>
               <p>§ 7. But this last objection being forked,<note place="margin">No danger of superstition in this subject.</note> hath the sharper point there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
still behinde, challenging this our subject to be guilty of superstition.
A sinne always detestable to God, but now adayes grown odious to
man. And well it were if the edge of their Zeal were equally whetted
against Profanenesse. Sure if this our work were faulty in this kind, I
my self would send it the same way with the <hi>Ephesian<note n="l" place="margin">Acts 19. 19.</note> conjuring bookes.</hi>
Not all the water of <hi>Kishon,</hi> of <hi>Iordan,</hi> of the <hi>Red,</hi> of the <hi>Dead,</hi> of the <hi>Middle-Land
Sea,</hi> described in these Maps, should serve to quench the fire,
but all should be burnt to ashes. But no such haste I hope, to condemn
this innocent book, wherein studiously we have abstained from all
such pictures as come within the bounds of danger, yea borders of
offence, and have onely made choice of those, which the most precise
approve usefull for the illustration of Scripture.</p>

               <p>HAving done with the description of the commodities of this
Countrey, we come now to the serverall divisions thereof; which
thing seriously considered conduceth much to the right understanding
of the Scripture. In severall ages the land fell under different divisions.</p>

2 Afterwards the same was subdivided into one and thirty petty
Kingdomes.</item>
                  <item>3 By <hi>Ioshua</hi> it was parcelled into twelve portions, betwixt so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
tribes.</item>
                  <item>4 In <hi>Rehoboams</hi> reigne it was rent into two kingdomes, <hi>Iudah</hi> and
<hi>Israel.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5 After the Captivity it was divided into three Provinces, <hi>Iudea,
Samaria,</hi> and <hi>Galile.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>6 In Christs and his Apostles time it was carved into four Tetrar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies,
and some other appendent dominions.</item>
               </list>
               <p>We will first survey it in the originall condition thereof, as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
of a Heptarchy, or seven ruling nations of <hi>Canaan,</hi> whose number,
names, extraction, and severall habitations require much care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to rank and order them aright.</p>
               <p>The first difficulty we meet with, is in the number of these nations, so
variously reckoned up. They are counted up thus: two, <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. 7.
three, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23. 28. five, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13. 5. sixe, <hi>Exod.</hi> 3. 8. 17. seven, <hi>Iosh.</hi> 3. 10.
ten, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 19. eleven, <hi>Gen.</hi> 10. 15. &amp; 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. 13. and seventeen,
if a collective number of them all be cast up. Now how come they to
be so differently computed where one and the same Spirit is the Auditour
to state their account? It is answered, that seven was the compleat and
solemne number, whereon God himself emphatically insists when re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
his favours to the <hi>Iews,<note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 7. 1.</note> Seven nations greater and mighter then thou.</hi>
And perchance the beast in the Revelation<note n="b" place="margin">Revel. 13. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>with seven heads,</hi> beareth
some allusion thereunto. Wherefore when these seven nations are
summed up defectively, under that number, we must conceive such of
them as are omitted to be implyed under the <hi>Genericall name</hi> of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites.</hi>
But on the other side, when above seven are brought, then the
inhabitants of the larger <hi>Canaan,</hi> are cast into the account: whose coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
was promised too, but never peaceably possessed by the <hi>Israelites,</hi> as
we observed before. We finde three severall Editions (as I may call
them) of the nations of <hi>Canaan,</hi> whereof the most authentick and

titles, then large treasure. And these <hi>Royolets</hi> contented themselves, that
their crowns (though not so big) were as bright, their scepters

               <p>It will be objected, that though age and accidents may alter the old,

in the description of Countreys, where the same chanels of sea, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses
of rivers, falls of vales, flats of plains, ridges of hills, must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main.
As for mountains, time, for want of carriage, must be forced

water-marks, must always continue, without any considerable altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

are moveable with time and casualty, inundations, tempests, and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes;
in the last (being the earths violent cough) sometimes she spits up
her own lungs, casting up great hills where never were any before. What

Tribes away captive, and in exchange, brought in his own colonies to
possess their conquered Countrey. However, although the main body
of the ten Tribes were thus transplanted, without any hope to return to
their native soil, yet some competent representation of every Tribe, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained

the contrary. For there was no inducting them into their former
inheritances, because no vacancy or avoidance therein; <hi>terra plena,</hi> the
land was still full with the plantation of <hi>Medes</hi> and others brought in by
<hi>Shalmaneser.</hi> So that this remnant of the ten Tribes, were (for the main)
fain promiscuously to make their habitations where they might, whilst
<hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> were restored to their ancient, intire, and distinct
possessions. Yet there is some probability, that some of <hi>Zebulun</hi> and

of<note n="i" place="margin">2 Chr. 11. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>Israel</hi> resorted to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> For, the by-ditches of <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi>
did not so drain the peoples devotion, but that much thereof ran in the
right chanel to the Temple; and no doubt, many violently kept at home,
had their hearts at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and their bodies in <hi>Israel,</hi> to which king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
all the rest of the Tribes did belong.</p>
               <p>§ 4. Here it will be richly worth our pains, to enter on a compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
estimate of these two Kingdomes, which of them exceeded in puis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sance:
Herein we shall carry an impartiall hand; and indeed, though
the controversie be betwixt two Kings, there is nothing to be got by
flattering of either.</p>
               <p>§ 5. We will compare them first in that, wherein <hi>Solomon</hi> placeth

               </p>
               <p>§ 6. Secondly, if the extent of their dominions be surveyed, and our
eye in the Map made umpirer therein, the case is clear in view without
measuring, that <hi>Israel</hi> was the greatest.</p>
               <p>§ 7. Thirdly, if their Cities be numbred, the result will be this, <hi>Iudah</hi>
had the Sun, <hi>Ierusalem; Israel</hi> had the Moon, <hi>Samaria,</hi> and most Starres
of the first magnitude, <hi>Ieri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>§ 8. Fourthly, if their ports, and naval power be considered, neither
will be found very active that way, contentedly yeelding their sea-tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to the <hi>Phenicians.</hi> Yet <hi>Israel</hi> had the advantage of havens, and marine
accommodations, bordering most on the Mediterranean; <hi>Iudah</hi> also (to
hold the scales even) had <hi>Ezion-Gaber,</hi> a considerable port on the Red-sea,
as may appear by <hi>Ahaziahs</hi> request to <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi>
                  <note n="l" place="margin">1 King. 22. 49.</note> 
                  <hi>Let my servants goe with
thy servants in the ships;</hi> plainly importing, that the men of <hi>Iudah</hi> were the
Cape-merchants and prime mariners in those seas, by whose courtesie
the subjects of the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> were admitted to trafique there. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<hi>Ezion-Gaber</hi> on the Red-sea was but a key to the back-door (little
of the East-Indies being then known, and less traded to) whereas the
havens on the Midland-sea opened the broad gates of commerce to the
most and best frequented parts of the world.</p>
               <p>§ 9. Fifthly, if the absoluteness of their Kings power be stated in
their respective dominions, here in the opinions of some the upper hand
must be adjudged to <hi>Iudah.</hi> The Kings whereof in administration of
justice (or rather revenge) often exercised arbitrary power, making
use of their prerogative above law. As appears by <hi>Solomons</hi> proceedings
against the lives of <hi>Shimei, Ioab,</hi> and <hi>Adoniah;</hi> and more plainly in <hi>Ieho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram's</hi>
                  <note n="m" place="margin">1 King. 21. 13.</note> executing his own brethren, by his peremptory pleasure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
legall conviction of them. Whereas no monument is extant, of
such arbitrary proceedings in the kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> more confining them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
to legall courses. Yea, the very murder of <hi>Naboth</hi> carried the face
of a judiciall process, wherein legall <hi rend="sup">n</hi> formalities of witnesses, though
suborned, were observed in a solemn Session. The reason why the Kings
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48509:29"/>
of <hi>Iudah</hi> were more unlimited in their power, was, say they, because
they derived their title immediately from the God of heaven, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in <hi>Davids</hi> familie by severall descents. But the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Creatures of their own subjects, made by popular election, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
to remit their taxes and burdens, (and seldome above three of the
same stock in a direct succession) were fain to ingratiate themselves,
with remitting much of that royall rigour used by the Kings of <hi>Iudah.</hi>
And this is assigned by a judicious<note n="o" place="margin">Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh</hi> Hist. World 1 part. 2600. cap. 19.
Sect. 6.</note> Author as a principall cause why
<hi>Israel</hi> never returned to their former subjection to <hi>Davids</hi> family, because
the scepter of <hi>Iudah</hi> was too heavy for them, and they lived under more
liberty in their own kingdome.</p>
               <p>§ 10. Sixtly, if their forain impressions, made by them on neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Princes be considered, the balance is so even, it is hard to say,
on which side the beam breaketh. For, as memorable were the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of the Kings of <hi>Israel</hi> against the <hi>Syrians,</hi> so no lesse fortunate the
fights of some Kings<note n="p" place="margin">Asa, 2 Chron. 14. 13. &amp; Ichosaphat, 2 Chron. 20. 23</note> of <hi>Iudah</hi> against the <hi>Ethiopians,</hi> and other enemies.
And as the kingdome of <hi>Moab,</hi> till the death of <hi>Ahab,</hi> was<note n="q" place="margin">2 King. 3. 5.</note> tributary to
<hi>Israel:</hi> so <hi>Edom,</hi> untill the end of the reign<note n="r" place="margin">2 Chr. 21. 8.</note> of <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi> was in subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to the crown of <hi>Iudah.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 11. Seventhly, if their home-achievements each against other, be
recounted, (the truest touch-stone of their severall strengths) God often
made them alternately hold up one another, whilst he whipt them both
for their sinnes. But although <hi>Abijah</hi> once got a remarkable<note n="s" place="margin">2 Chr. 13. 19.</note> conquest
of <hi>Ieroboam,</hi> yet generally <hi>Israel</hi> worsted <hi>Iudah,</hi> overpowering them with
multitude of men. Thus <hi>Baasha</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">2 Chron. 16. 1.</note> cooped up <hi>Asa</hi> in his own land; <hi>Ioash</hi>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">2 Chr. 25. 23.</note> overcame <hi>Amaziah,</hi> and took <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> and <hi>Pekah</hi> almost utterly<note n="w" place="margin">2 Chr 28. 6.</note> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed
<hi>Ahaz,</hi> and his kingdome.</p>
               <p>§ 12. To conclude, if their lasting and continuance be measured,
herein <hi>Iudah</hi> clearly carrieth away the preheminence. Grant, <hi>Israel</hi> beat
<hi>Iudah</hi> at hand, yet <hi>Iudah</hi> beat <hi>Israel</hi> at length, even out of distance. For,
whilst the <hi>Babylonish</hi> captivity did onely snuffe <hi>Iudah,</hi> for seventy years,
(blazing the brighter when they returned from banishment) the <hi>Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>
conquest utterly extinguished <hi>Israel,</hi> from ever appearing again, in a

draught of a Countrey is no regulated Map, but a paper
full of names of places. However, vast is the difference betwixt the miles
in severall Countreys. An <hi>Italian</hi> mile containeth seven, an <hi>English</hi>
eight furlongs. A <hi>French</hi> is equall to two, a <hi>vulgar Dutch</hi> to three <hi>English</hi>
miles, the <hi>large Dutch</hi> to four, the miles in <hi>Swizerland</hi> to five, not to say six
of our <hi>English</hi> computation: so that, in that mountainous countrey, tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
have a double disheartning, the worst of ways, and longest of
miles. Yea upon the Alpes in the juncture of <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> in the
self same mountain, on the north side the miles are the longest, on the
south side the shortest in Christendome.</p>
               <p>§ 2. Come over into <hi>England,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">And betwixt miles of the same countrey.</note> and what difference is there betwixt a
<hi>Middlesex</hi> and a <hi>Yorkshire</hi> mile? The former the shortest, because (as some
will have it) every London-Lady when weary with walking, concludes
the space though never so short to be a mile: whilest the well moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>Rank-riders</hi> in the northern countrey, insensible of the length of the
way, because of the swiftness of their horses, make miles of the largest
proportion. Our scale of miles presented in all these Maps, is according
to the <hi>English</hi> mile containing eight furlongs; to which we have redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
(a task rather troublesome then difficult) the measures of other
authours, giving allowance according to the standards of the severall
countreys whereof they were.</p>
               <p>§ 3. Here (if my complaint might finde any pity, and that pity give me
any ease) I would complain of the irreconcileable difference betwixt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
(proceeding on one and the same scale of miles) in making their
distances betwixt their severall places. We read of <hi>Saul</hi> that he so scatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
the army of the <hi>Ammonites</hi> so that<note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 11. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>two of them were not lest together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi>
Such a dispersion we finde in the judgment of learned men, not two of
them generally concurring in the measuring of miles betwixt eminent
places.</p>
               <p>§ 4. Now as Jurie-men, when severall witnesses swear point-blank
one against another, make bold to beleeve his testimony who appears
most credible unto them, such power we have assumed to our selves in
these differences, to follow those, who we conceive have the best autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Herein having a speciall regard to those that lived upon the place,
and preferring their judgments above others, though otherwise of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
learning, because in <hi>matters of fact</hi> done in his presence, the eyes of a
child are to be beleeved before the eares of a man.</p>
               <p>§ 5. Where both authours appear of equall authority in themselves,
and number of followers, we have umpired the difference by pitching
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:48509:36"/>
on a middle number betwixt both. For instance,<note n="b" place="margin">Patest. Seig. f. 19.</note> 
                  <hi>Seiglerus</hi> makes it
fourteen thousand paces or fourteen miles betwixt <hi>Zidon</hi> and <hi>Tyre</hi> (emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Marts, and therefore the distance betwixt them might be notorious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
known) whilst<note n="c" place="margin">Vadian. Phax. f. 271.</note> 
                  <hi>Vadianus</hi> makes it two hundred furlongs, or twenty
miles. Here to part the difference equall, we have insisted on 17 miles.</p>
               <p>§ 6. However when this, and much more caution is used by us,
our Scale of miles is so farre from pretending to the exactness of
those left-handed <hi>Gibeonites<note n="d" place="margin">Jud. 20. 16.</note> to hit the mark at an haires-breadth and not misse,</hi>
that a large and charitable latitude must still be allowed us in a subject so
hard and full of uncertainty. Yea the holy Spirit it self speaks not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitively
of distances of places, but with words of qualification.<note n="e" place="margin">Luke 24. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>About
threescore furlongs from Ierusalem to Emmaus;<note n="f" place="margin">John 6. 19.</note> About five and twenty or thirty fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
they had rowed on the Sea;</hi> as if five in thirty made no considerable
difference. If the same favour may be but allowed our scale of miles,
I doubt not but it will acquit it self against all just exception.</p>
               <p>§ 7. Now for the further managing of our <hi>Scale of miles</hi> we request
the Reader not to extend it, therewith to measure all the properties, or
History-pictures in our Map (for then some men would appear Giants,
yea monsters, many miles long) expecting him rather to carry a scale in
his own eyes, for surveying such portraitures. Yea in generall I undertake
nothing in defence or excuse of those pictures, to be done according to
the rule of Art, as none of my work, ornamentall, not essentiall to the
Maps: onely this I will say, that eminency in English Gravers, is not to
be expected till their Art be more countenanced and encouraged. Nor
would I have the Scale applied to Cities drawn in Prospective, as to
<hi>Rabbah</hi> in the Tribe of <hi>Gad</hi> &amp;c. which then will fall out bigger then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
they were; desiring the Reader onely to understand them to be

the same places presented in severall Maps, (some such will escape in
defiance of all diligence) we hope the same will appear inconsiderable, &amp;
such moats (not being before the sight, but in the corner of the eye) will lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
if at all, hinder the light of a Geographical truth. Surely as in the strictest
laws of Horse-racers, some <hi>wast of weight</hi> is allowed to the Riders: so me
thinks some favour ought to be afforded an Author, in measuring and
making many Maps, were it but for the shaking of his weary hand in
so tedious a work. But if such differences appear somewhat great, let

those be relied on as the truest, where such places are set down <hi>datâ

concerning <hi>Government</hi> and
<hi>Nobility,</hi> whence each of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
their originall.</p>
               <p>For the first, I finde it as ancient
as <hi>Man,</hi> and extracted from <hi>God</hi>
himself. Who because he was a <hi>Spirit,</hi> (and therefore invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible)
the better to try what Tribute of obedience, Men out of

as his own visible Image (in the infancy of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind)
on the <hi>Father of the family,</hi> that so honour and duty
might be given to <hi>God</hi> in yeelding subjection to him who
represented him. These first <hi>Governours</hi> were termed <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arches,</hi>
that is, <hi>Father-Princes,</hi> their compounded name,
speaking their mixt authority. And<note n="a" place="margin">Ant. Iud. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">

                  <hi>Josephus</hi> writing of the

                  </gap>, <hi>He left,</hi> or
<hi>passed over his principality to</hi> Lamech <hi>his son;</hi> and this
<hi>Prince-ship</hi> continued in the <hi>Primogeniture</hi> for many Ages,
till the method thereof was discomposed, partly by the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosity
of mankinde, partly by their far dispersed habitations.</p>
               <p>Thus was <hi>Government</hi> the <hi>Mistresse,</hi> first born in the
world, whilest <hi>Nobility</hi> her <hi>Maide</hi> came in not long after to
attend her. For such <hi>Persons,</hi> whose vertuous dispositions
commended them to the speciall favour of <hi>Princes in Power,</hi>
had in reward of their worth; <hi>markes of Honour</hi> fixed upon
them: which afterward by succession descended unto their
posterity.</p>
               <p>Of these, some imitating their <hi>Ancestours</hi> goodness, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
in the splendor of their <hi>Nobility,</hi> whilest others degene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
by their vicious courses, invited neglect and contempt
upon themselves. Insomuch that in some the <hi>valour</hi> and <hi>spirit</hi> of
their <hi>Progenitors</hi> (which advanced them by the <hi>sword</hi> in time
of <hi>war</hi>) evaporated all into empty aire; turning into a <hi>wild</hi> and
<hi>riotous animosity;</hi> And in others, the gravity and wisdome
of their Grandfathers (which promoted them by the <hi>Gown</hi>
in the days of <hi>Peace</hi>) settleth into feculent earth, leaving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but a <hi>tame and unactive stupidity</hi> behinde it.</p>
               <p>Herethe <hi>Nobility</hi> of such had expired, save that some of them
seasonably perceiving the desperate <hi>Consumption</hi> thereof
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48509:38"/>
did follow the prescription of <hi>Physick,</hi> and returned into the
<hi>Native aire</hi> which first gave Honour her birth and being;
and did so repair their lost reputation by practising the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
vertues of <hi>Piety, Courtesie, Hospitality; Valour,
Wisdome,</hi> and <hi>Learning;</hi> thus going home to the <hi>Climate</hi>
wherein Nobility was first conceived.</p>
               <p>But thanks be to God, your Lordship is none of those
personally guilty of any decay of dignity; whose vertues pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
your Honour in the perfect health and strength thereof,
which hath been the main motive to make me so desirous to
present my book to your Honour, as a proper Patron, even to the
height, for all purposes and intents. Whose Iudgment can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the whole, Clemency Pardon what is amiss, and Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
Protect the rest in defiance of opposition.</p>
               <p>Indeed Sir, besides desire to shelter my self under your Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage,
gratitude obligeth me to tender my service to your
Honour. For all my Books, being my <hi>nether and upper

not a Letter from your <hi>Lady-mother</hi> preserved the greatest

§ 3. This Countrey had <hi>Iordan</hi> on the west, (dividing it from <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi>
and <hi>Benjamin</hi>) the River <hi>Arnon</hi> on the east and south (parting it from

for grazing, not as if defective in corn and wine, wherein it shared with

them accordingly. Now though herein we have given the <hi>Levites</hi> lands
the largest and most favourable bounds (seeing I am unable to endow

their <hi>ranking</hi> for the best behoof of the people, for whose instruction
they were intended. They were the <hi>Salt of the earth,</hi> and therefore God
sprinkled them here and there, the more conveniently to season the
whole nation. Insomuch that some English Parishes are more remote
from their Mother-church, then most places in <hi>Canaan</hi> were distant
from the Cities of the <hi>Levites.</hi> We must not forget that in <hi>Ieroboams</hi> aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie,
the religious <hi>Levites</hi> forsook their Cities and<note n="r" place="margin">2 Chr. 11. 14.</note> fled to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
voluntary exile before wealthy homes, on the condition of an
Idolatrous compliance. It appears not in Scripture, how these Cities
and lands thus left were disposed of. Whether <hi>Ieroboam</hi> himself seised
on them, converting them into demeans of his Crown, or whether he
suffered them to revert to those respective Tribes, from whom they were
taken: so fastning his subjects affections unto him with nailes of gold of
their own profit. Either course may be conceived a cause to hasten the
captivity of the people; it being just that those, who swallow Gods
morsels, should be spewed out of their own possessions.</p>

<hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Arnon</hi> they had forty severall stations, and then entred into the
<hi>Promised land.</hi> In comemoration whereof, probably God did order,
that an offender should receive but <hi>forty stripes</hi> (what Judge soever
counts them too few, would think thirty too many, if he felt them him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self)
and then be freed from further punishment. Coming into <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi>

the countrey, made them an entertainment, which could not be court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like

beholding the <hi>Midianitish</hi> women, first liking their faces, then tasting
their feasts, stepped from their <hi>Boards</hi> to their <hi>Beds,</hi> thence to their Altars,
adding spirituall to corporall fornication. This was done by the<note n="e" place="margin">Numb. 31. 16.</note> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of <hi>Balaam,</hi> whose counsell did more hurt then his curse. All his
charmes could have done them no harm, had he not raised these female

               <p>§ 20. Let us now request the Reader, to climbe up the hills of <hi>Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim,
Nebo,</hi> and <hi>Pisgah.</hi> These are a ledge of mountains rising by degrees
from east to west. So that some have compared <hi>Abarim</hi> to the Chancell,
<hi>Nebo</hi> to the Church, and <hi>Pisgah</hi> to the steeple. In mount <hi>Nebo</hi> the Authour
of the<note n="g" place="margin">2 Macc. 2. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Maccabees,</hi> speaks of a Cave, wherein <hi>Ieremy laid the Tabernacle,

Authour in the conclusion of his book confesseth, that his work is like
<note n="h" place="margin">2 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>wine tempered with water:</hi> and we take this story to be no genuine juice
of the grape, and value it accordingly. On <hi>Pisgah, Moses</hi> surveyed the
whole land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and although he was advantaged by the height of
the place, and clearness of his eyes (no whit abated in their sight at an
<note n="i" place="margin">Deut. 34. 7.</note> hundred and twenty years of age) yet much of miracle must needs be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted,
in so plain and far discovery. Here <hi>Moses</hi> was buried, being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledged
above other servants of God (whose souls Angels convey to
heaven) that an Angel was his Sexton, to cover his body in earth. Here
he concealed <hi>Moses</hi> his grave, lest the <hi>Israelites</hi> should goe a whoring af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it. Destroying Idolatry is a pious, but preventing it a more provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Act, crushing it in the occasions thereof. Let none condemn this
for a needless caution, as if no fear that they who sometimes would
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48509:46"/>
stone <hi>Moses</hi> while living, should adore him when dead. For the crooked
nature of the <hi>Iews</hi> was bowed to <hi>Extremes,</hi> and had no mean betwixt
<hi>hating,</hi> and <hi>adoring.</hi> Besides, when the memories of eminent men, hated
or envied when living, have passed the purgation of death, it is usuall
for their former enemies to fall in love with them.</p>

Not to repeat the places of the west, because mentioned before, looking

worshipped. We read indeed how<note n="k" place="margin">Num. 22. 38.</note> 
                  <hi>Reuben</hi> changed the names of the
Cities of <hi>Nebo,</hi> and <hi>Baalmeon</hi> (because their old names taken from false
Gods resented of Idolatry.) But so hard it is to unhabit mens mouths
from old ill customes, that it seems their ancient names still prevailed
in common discourse.<note n="l" place="margin">Voss. de origi. &amp; progres. Idol. lib. 2. pa. 346.</note> Criticks start many controversies concerning

Secondly, whether under it the Moon (as the Sun under <hi>Bell</hi>) was not
mystically adored. Thirdly, whether the same with <hi>Chemosh</hi> and <hi>Baal-Peor</hi>
(which is the opinion of Saint <hi>Ierome</hi>) and if not, wherein lay the
difference? But it shall never trouble me, whether the fictitious Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
of <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iambres</hi> the <hi>Egyptian</hi> enchanters, were made alike, or
did differ in some particulars, seeing the reall serpents of <hi>Moses</hi>
                  <note n="n" place="margin">Exod. 7. 12.</note> devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them all up. And seeing long since the service of the true God hath
confuted and confounded all worship of false Idols, I list not to trade in
the curiosities of distinctions betwixt them.</p>

battell was fought and won at once, by <hi>Ioab</hi> against the <hi>Aramites,</hi> and
<hi>Abishai</hi> against the <hi>Ammonites.</hi> And it seems that the latter of these had at
this time the City in their possession, whither they retreated after their
overthrow. For what else doe those words import; <hi>The children of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon

without making of two Cities of the same name (such multiplication
unwarrantable, save where absolute necessity enforceth it) I finde no fitter
expedient, then by setting <hi>Heshbon</hi> so equally between these two Tribes, as
partially in both, and totally in neither. Thus <hi>Bristoll</hi> is situated betwixt

King of the Amorites</hi> (but then possest by <hi>Reuben</hi>) in his circuit whence no
doubt plenty of good fare out of this Pasture-countrey so abounding in
cattell, was brought to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Now we have placed the name of
<hi>Amorites</hi> on the sinister front of this our description, because they were
the old inhabitants of this Countrey: our constant custome through this
Book in the adverse page opposite to the <hi>Tribes</hi> name to insert one of
the seven Nations of <hi>Canaan,</hi> (former owners of that land) conceiving
it to conduce much to the illustration of Scripture.</p>
               <p>§ 29. Modern Heralds, by Commission authorized from the
Jewish <hi>Rabbines,</hi> assign to <hi>Reuben</hi> for armes, <hi>Argent, three Bars waveè
azure,</hi> in allusion to <hi>Iacobs</hi> Legacy,<note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 49. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Unstable as water, thou shalt not excell.</hi>
For as water cannot hold it self, but as it is held in a vessell, so <hi>Reuben</hi>
could not contain himself within the bounds of chastity, till shame and
sorrow did reclaim him. Besides, as water once shed, is never to be
gathered up again; so <hi>Reuben</hi> could never after recollect his lost credit,
to recover the full favour of his Father. Though once he endevoured
to gather up some spilt drops of his reputation by projecting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance
of<note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 37. 21.</note> 
                  <hi>Ioseph</hi> from his brethren: but his design miscarried.</p>
               <p>§ 30. For mine own part, I cannot concur with the common opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
that these three <hi>Bars waveè</hi> were the Armes of <hi>Reuben;</hi> princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
because Armes are honorary ensignes, assign'd, or assum'd for
the greater grace of the bearer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Improbable therefore, that this Tribe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuate
the infamy of their ancestour would always have water running
in their shield, as if <hi>Reubens</hi> crime were the <hi>Reubenites</hi> credit; like such
whom the<note n="k" place="margin">Philip. 3. 19.</note> Apostle reproves, <hi>that glory in their shame.</hi> Rather let us
hearken to <hi>Aben Ezra,</hi> who allots to the banner of <hi>Reuben</hi> a man or
male child (others a mandrake, others put mandrakes in his hand) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to <hi>Leahs</hi> words at his birth, calling him <hi>Reuben,</hi> that is,<note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 29. 32.</note> 
                  <hi>See a Son,</hi>
causing her <hi>to forget her pain, for joy that a man child was borne into the world.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 31. The proper place for the standard of this Tribe was to be the<note n="m" place="margin">Num. 2. 10.</note> first
of the three Tribes which pitched on the south of the Tabernacle. Thus
though <hi>Reuben</hi> lost the Primacy of power over all, he still kept the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency
of place before one quarter of his brethren. Whence parents
may be taught, that though on just ground they disinherit, yet not so
wholly to dishearten their eldest sons, but still suffer some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrances
of a birthright ever to remain unto them.</p>

               <p>§ 2. The land of this Tribe was of a double nature. For what lay
north of the river <hi>Iabbok</hi> was anciently the possession of <hi>Og King of Basan.</hi>
But what lay south of the river, had its property more intricate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbred

               <p>Behold we here what the Psalmist<note n="g" place="margin">Psal. 80. 9.</note> saith, <hi>Thou hast brought a Vine out of
Egypt, thou preparest room before it;</hi> the method and manner of which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
is most remarkable. First, God in his providence foresaw
that the Countrey of the <hi>Canaanites</hi> was without other addition too nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
to receive the numerous people of <hi>Israel.</hi> Secondly, God in his
goodness resolved out of love to righteous <hi>Lot,</hi> that his posterity should
not totally lose their possession, nor would he suffer the <hi>Israelites</hi> their
kinsmen to deprive them of any parcell thereof; giving them a flat
command to the contrary.<note n="h" place="margin">Deut. 2. 9. 19.</note> Lastly, God in his justice permitted <hi>Sihon
King of the Amorites</hi> should win part of the Countrey from <hi>Moab</hi> and
<hi>Ammon;</hi> and suddenly sends the <hi>Israelites</hi> to conquer the conquerour;
and now lawfully to inherit, what the other had wrongfully taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way:
And thus <hi>he prepared room for his Vine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>§ 3. By this time we plainly perceive, that in the <hi>Ammonites</hi> demand
to <hi>Iephtha,</hi> there was some truth blinded with more falshood, that the
countenance of the former might pass the latter unsuspected.<note n="i" place="margin">Iudg. 11. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>Israel took
away</hi> (saith the King) <hi>my Land when they came out of Egypt from Arnon even
unto Iabbok, and unto Iordan; now therefore restore these Lands again peaceably.</hi>
True it was, that this Land was once theirs (and so it is plainly called
<hi>Ioshua</hi> 13. 25.) but most false, that ever the <hi>Israelites</hi> took Inch of ground
from them, save onely mediately and at the second hand, taking it
from <hi>Sihon,</hi> who took it from the <hi>Ammonites.</hi> We report the rest to <hi>Ieph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha's</hi>
answer (who first with a fair ambassie, and then with a famous
victory confuted the <hi>Ammonites</hi> antiquated title to this territory) plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
that the <hi>Israelites</hi> had three<note n="k" place="margin">Iudg. 11. 26.</note> hundred years peaceably possessed the
same. Now, if upon a strict account, some years fall short of that sum,
the matter is not much, because souldiers love to fill their mouths with
a round number, and too hundred fifty and odde with a good sword
may well be counted three hundred years currant, though not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate.</p>
               <p>§ 4. The Tribe of <hi>Gad</hi> had the kingdome of <hi>Ammon</hi> on the east, the
half Tribe of <hi>Manasseh</hi> on the north, <hi>Reuben</hi> on the south, and the river
<hi>Iordan</hi> on the west. The length thereof from <hi>Aroer</hi> to <hi>Iordan</hi> may be
computed thirty five miles: and the breadth thereof from <hi>Mahanaim</hi> to
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48509:50"/>
                  <hi>Dibon,</hi> falls out a little less. A Tribe inferiour to none for fair rivers, fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
Pastures, shady woods: superiour to most for populous Cities, and
memorable actions atchieved therein. As for <hi>Balme</hi> or <hi>Balsame,</hi> it was
a peculiar commodity of this Countrey. Thus the Prophet betwixt
grief, anger, and pity demands, <hi>Is<note n="l" place="margin">Ier. 8. 22.</note> there no balme in Gilead?</hi> and again, <hi>Goe
up into Gilead, and take<note n="m" place="margin">Ier. 46. 11.</note> balm O virgin.</hi> In describing this Countrey we
will follow the streams of <hi>Arnon, Iabbok,</hi> and <hi>Iordan,</hi> which (with some
little help lent us besides) will afford us the conveniency to behold all
remarkable mounts in this Countrey.</p>
               <p>§ 5. In the eastern part of this Tribe the rivers of <hi>Arnon</hi> and <hi>Iabbok</hi>
(though running contrary ways) arise not far asunder: according to

                  <hi>Iosephus,</hi> who saith that the land of <hi>Sihon King
of the Amorites, lay in nature and fashion like an Island,</hi> betwixt the three rivers
of <hi>Iordan, Arnon,</hi> and <hi>Iabbok,</hi> so near are the fountains of the latter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
The heads of their springs are found in a mountainous and rocky
soil, affording great plenty of <hi>Iackalls;</hi> mungrell creatures of equivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
extraction, deriving cruelty from the Wolves their sires and craft
from the Foxes their dams. These <hi>Iackalls</hi> are meant by our translatours
<hi>Psalm 63. 10. Let them fall by the edge of the sword, that they may be a portion
for Foxes:</hi> not for ordinary Foxes, which indeed are so dainty mouthed,
that they will not feed on any carkasse, but what they kill themselves:
but for these <hi>Iackalls</hi> (which may pass for Foxes, because so by the surer
side) so ravenous, that they will not onely feed on carion above ground,
but even dig holes into the earth, fetch forth, and feed on dead bodies of
men, if not deeply interred.</p>

                  <hi>Aroer,</hi> a fair City
whereof frequent mention in Scripture, but in no other notion, but
onely as the eastern boundary of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Here <hi>Arnon</hi> entertaineth a
river from the west, called the river of<note n="o" place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>Gad,</hi> because rising, running, and
falling within the compass of this Tribe.</p>
               <p>§ 7. This river of <hi>Gad</hi> had formerly received into it another stream
called the waters of <hi>Nimrim,</hi> threatned by the<note n="p" place="margin">Isa. 156. Ier. 48. 34.</note> Prophets to be dried up: on
the banks whereof <hi>Bethnimrah</hi> a City was seated. At the conflux of these
two, the <hi>Sea of Iazer</hi> is found, being no other then a Lake (about our <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlesey

                  <hi>Aroer:</hi> a clear evidence both
of their distinction and vicinity. Hereabouts <hi>Ioab</hi>
                  <note n="x" place="margin">2 Sam. 24. 5.</note> pitched his tent,
when sent to number the people. Wonder not that having the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
of three Cities so near to receive him, he preferred rather to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side
in a tent during that imployment. For (besides that such movable
habitations comply best with military men) it was fittest for the work
in hand; where the people to be reckoned might have full and free ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse
in open aire; both wholsomer for the persons, and speedyer in dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch,
then when pent within the streets and walls of a City. Nothing
else memorable remains in the southeast corner of this Tribe, save <hi>Dibon,</hi>
a City sometimes assigned to<note n="y" place="margin">Iosh. 13. 17.</note> 
                  <hi>Reuben,</hi> and sometimes to<note n="z" place="margin">Num. 32. 34.</note> 
                  <hi>Gad.</hi> To
reconcile this, some make them different and distant Cities; which in
my apprehension is rather to set up two marks then to hit the right one.
For seeing these two Tribes confine together, and both lay claim to
<hi>Dibon</hi> (like the two mothers challenging the living childe) we have
onely, in stead of a sword, made use of pricks, setting it equally in the
bounds of both. Here we advise the Reader (not out of distrust of his
skill, but desire of his good) to beware, neither to confound this <hi>Dibon
in Gad,</hi> with<note n="a" place="margin">Num. 33. 45.</note>

our discourse of this river, and to attend that worthy Patriarch in
his travels through this Tribe, which in form of a Belt crossed <hi>Gad</hi>
athwart from northeast to southwest. <hi>Iacob</hi> first entring into this Tribe
came to <hi>Nahanaim,</hi> that is, <hi>the two campes,</hi> because there the<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 32. 2.</note> Angels di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested

admonition to <hi>Iacob,</hi> that he overcame not with his own striving, but
his opposites yeelding, gave him a gentle touch, being pleased, where he

him. And now seeing the way which we have come is both plain
and pleasant, let me request the Reader not to begrutch his pains to goe
some part of it back again, onely exchanging the company of plain

§ 12. <hi>Gideon</hi> pursuing the flying <hi>Midianites</hi> with his souldiers, as faint

               </p>
               <p>§ 13. The mention of <hi>those that dwell in tents,</hi> puts me in mind, that it
is as much my duty here to tender my conjecture to the Reader, as it is
his liberty to receive or reject it. There was a Countrey, undoubtedly in
this Tribe, called the<note n="x" place="margin">2 Sam. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Ioab</hi> made his second station, when sent to number the people. Now
may not this in probability be the very place, where the <hi>Israelites</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dwelled in tents, and in <hi>Davids</hi> victorious reign were reduced to more
stability, and incouraged to turn their tents into houses, more certain
and solid habitations?</p>
               <p>§ 14. To return now to the river <hi>Iabbok,</hi> half impatient for our long

because there<note n="y" place="margin">Iudg. 12. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>Iephtha</hi> defeated the <hi>Ephraimites</hi> for their insolent mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny

not that sticks had a mouth more voracious then steel, understand it that
some were devoured by beasts, others famished as lost in the labyrinths
of the forest, and some staked on sharp piles in the fierceness of their
flight. Well might such sad fate befall the common souldiers, which
happened to <hi>Absalom</hi> himself. This was he that boasted how upright he
would be when made a<note n="a" place="margin">2 Sam. 15. 4.</note> Judge, whereas now, if the length of his hair
conduced any thing to his execution, it was the best, yea onely piece of
justice performed by him. Yet more probable it is, that running in hast
(not so minding which way to goe, as to be gone) he was snatched up
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48509:52"/>
by the neck in a forked<note n="b" place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 9.</note> bough: How did the officious Oake act three
parts, being the Gallows, Halter, and Hangman for a traitour?
But this accident rather occasioned then caused his death: the Oake
was rather his Gaolor then his Executioner. It was <hi>Ioab</hi> that dispatched
him with three darts through his<note n="c" place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>heart.</hi> Wherein through a treble

there lie hard and heavy on his Corpes, and withall (if possible) sink
down his rebellious example for ever having a resurrection. No me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicall
monument but this hurdle of stones was fittest for such a
causer of confusion. Indeed in his life time he had erected a stately<note n="f" place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 18.</note>
Pillar near <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> intending it no doubt for the place of his buriall.
But just it was that his dead carkass should be deprived of his own

Countrey, two severall ways led hence to the City of <hi>Mahanaim.</hi> The

                  <hi>by the way of the plain,</hi> which the furthest about was the nearest

messenger <hi>volunteer,</hi> would confess to <hi>David</hi> no more news then what
he knew would be welcome, whilest <hi>Cushi</hi> a prest Post must relate the

to run slowly, as attending in suspence the issue of the Battell, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified
of the success thereof hastens with all possible speed to fall into the
river <hi>Iordan.</hi>

this river kept his ready course, preserving his stream intire from incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating

                  <item>3 They kept Swine to truck and barter with other nations.

               <p>But when those Hogs were sunk in the sea, a greater herd of them
remained in the City: swinish people, who preferred to wallow on
the dunghill of their own wealth, rather then to possess the pearl of
Christs presence, whom they requested to depart out of their coasts. So
much of the <hi>Gadarens,</hi> and their neighbours the <hi>Gergasens,</hi> onely let me
adde, that from the affinity of sound some have collected, the <hi>Girgashites</hi>
anciently to have inhabited this countrey, (as we have formerly obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved)

Souldiers stark blind in effect. For whereas the <hi>Iews</hi> were wont to wear
in war broad shields on their left arme, which as it sheltered their body,
so it hindred their sight on that side) when their right eye was put out
by their enemies sword, and the left blinded by their own shield, they
were, during the fight, deprived of the best fence of their body. But
<note n="q" place="margin">2 Sam. 11. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>Saul</hi> saved all this harm by a speedy march, suddenly surprizing the

the Corselet, but also the putting on thereof must be <hi>of proof</hi> to fence
death out, which otherwise will creep in at a small cranny. Yet <hi>Ahab</hi> was
staid up in his chariot til even, &amp; then the Sun &amp; his life set together. Some
years after King <hi>Iehoram Ahabs son</hi> at the same place received<note n="k" place="margin">2 King. 2. 14, 15.</note> wounds of
more honour and less danger, when forcibly he recovered this <hi>Ramoth-Gilead</hi>
from the Kings of <hi>Syria.</hi> But of all <hi>Iehorams</hi> hurts here received,
none went so near his heart, as that in this<note n="l" place="margin">2 King. 9. 1.</note> City, <hi>a son of the Prophets</hi> sent by

It seems it was parcell of the demeans of the Crown in the days of King

land in <hi>Sharon</hi> (and elsewhere) where his cattell was grased,<note n="*" place="margin">1. Chron. 27. 25, 26. &amp;c.</note> seeing
being <hi>Iesse's</hi> youngest Son, little land was left him from his Father, and

pent and populous a countrey, scarce a foot thereof, but related to some
owner not having power to alienate it from his heires, to whom at the
farthest it was to revert at the <hi>year of Iubilee</hi> when all dead possessions had
a resurrection to their proper owners. We conceive <hi>David</hi> held this land
by one of the following Titles.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1 <hi>By the fundamentall establishment of the Crown.</hi> For sure when that
Kings were made, publick provision was made for their Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

in their own dominions.</item>
                  <item>2 <hi>By improvement of wast grounds,</hi> which fell to the King as <hi>Lord of the
Soile.</hi> Yea seeing God made provisionary Laws for the Kings
behaviour, (<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 17. 15, 16.</note> four hundred years before any King was in <hi>Israel</hi>)
why might not a <hi>reserve of land</hi> be also left, at the partition of the
countrey by lot, for their Kings future maintenance?</item>
                  <item>3 <hi>By mutuall compact:</hi> some subjects on valuable consideration, (as
perchance the relaxing the tribute due from every person to his
Prince)<note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 17. 25.</note> might part (not with the propriety, but) present pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit
of their land for the Kings conveniency.</item>

was undoubted in it self, free from the least suspicion of injustice, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his own counsell:<note n="*" place="margin">Psal. 65. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>Trust not in oppression, become not vain in robbery.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The generall character given of these places consisteth principally in
these particulars.</p>

                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>From which last clause we collect that these Cities must be placed
somewhat near together, otherwise, how could an army probably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
to dispatch them all in one day? And though the Pagans might
mingle much pride with their malice in projecting things high and hard
to effect, yet surely they mixed some policy with their pride, not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound
to themselves meer impossibilities. But the seasonable coming of
<hi>Iudas Maccabeus</hi> with his host frustrated all the Pagans designes.</p>
               <p>§ 32. But the City of <hi>Ephron</hi> deserves serious consideration, for the sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
situation thereof. For in <hi>Maccabeus</hi> his return from <hi>Carnaim</hi> this
strong City stood so in his way, that <hi>he could not turn from it either to the right
hand or to the left,</hi>
                  <note n="t" place="margin">1 Mac. 5. 46.</note> but must needs pass through the midst of it. A place in
so tyrannicall a position may seem an affront to mans naturall liberty.
Yet such was the situation thereof near the<note n="u" place="margin">Vide tabulas Adrichomii.</note> confluence of <hi>Iabbok</hi> and <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan</hi>
(where perchance the way railed with <hi>Morasses</hi> on either side) and
being a pass of importance, <hi>Maccabeus</hi> was onely free to go this or no way.

Surely if a flying enemy deserve <hi>a bridge of gold to be given him,</hi> a potent
foe seriously proffering peaceably to depart, may merit a bridg of silver to
be lent him. But <hi>Maccabeus</hi> being denyed forced his way through the city
<note n="w" place="margin">1 Mac. 5. 51.</note> 
                  <hi>over them that were slain.</hi>

               <p>By <hi>Mahanaim</hi> here I understand not onely the <hi>Levites</hi> City so named,
(poor purveying for victualls within the walls of that alone)
but a large Territory of the same name round about it. And although
to us it is unknown how far the bounds thereof extended, yet they must
be concluded either very large or extraordinary fruitfull, acquitting it
self as a twelfth part of the Kingdome, and affording Court fare for one
moneth of the year. In the passage to this <hi>Mahanaim</hi> on the south (to

               </p>
               <p>§ 34. It will here be demanded, that seeing the land was by Gods
own appointment formerly divided into twelve parts, (the twelve
Tribes) adequate to the twelve moneths of the year, why did not <hi>Solomon</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:48509:56"/>
rather make use of this partition, which was <hi>jure divino,</hi> then make a new
modell out of his own fancy. It is answered, this later division of the
land, was found most convenient for house-keeping, and so more sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient
to this particular end for which it was ordained.</p>
               <p>If that any urge me to give a reason why in this division into <hi>Purveyer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships
Ramoth-Gilead</hi> distanced some miles off, was added to the jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Son of <hi>Geber,</hi> who was overseer in <hi>Manasseh,</hi> thereby mangling
and mutilating the intireness of the Countrey; let such first satisfie me,
why so many shreds and parcells of land (especially in <hi>Worcester</hi>

rather then lose a rightfull possession, and a good cause when plainly

judge thereof.</p>
                  <p>§ 2. We are now onely to describe that part of <hi>Manasseh</hi> which was
east of <hi>Iordan.</hi> Some will say, was it not pity the possessions of this
Tribe should be thus dismembred? Was it not enough that <hi>Ioseph was
<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 49. 26.</note> separated from his brethren,</hi> but <hi>Manasseh</hi> his Son must also be parted from
himself? How came that wisdome who pronounceth it<note n="g" place="margin">Psal. 133. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>good and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant
for brethren to live together in unity,</hi> to cleave this Tribe asunder? But let
such know, that unity in affection may consist with locall separation.
Besides, divine Providence might seem to have a designe herein, that
this Tribe of <hi>Manasseh</hi> having a joint interest on both sides of <hi>Iordan,</hi>
might claspe these Countries together: and the <hi>Manassites</hi> being (as I may
say) <hi>Amphibii,</hi> on both sides of the River, might by visits amongst their
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48509:59"/>
kindred, continue a correspondency and civill communion one with
another.</p>
                  <p>§ 3. <hi>Manasseh</hi> had mount <hi>Hermon</hi> and <hi>Gilead</hi> on the east, parting it
from the <hi>Ammonites,</hi> and <hi>Ismaelites, Iordan</hi> on the west, <hi>Gad</hi> on the south,
<hi>Syria,</hi> and particularly the kingdomes of <hi>Geshur</hi> and <hi>Maachah</hi> on the
north. In which compass of ground,<note n="h" place="margin">Deut. 3. 4, 5. &amp; Iosh. 13. 30. &amp; 1 King. 4. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>threescore Cities with high walls,
gates and bars, besides unwalled towns, were contained.</hi> Many will be amazed at
this number, &amp; the wonder will seem the greater when they shall reckon
but<note n="i" place="margin">Iosh. 19.</note> two and twenty Cities in <hi>Asher,</hi> nineteen in <hi>Naphtali,</hi> seventeen in
<hi>Simeon,</hi> sixteen in <hi>Issachar,</hi> &amp; but twelve in <hi>Zebulun:</hi> unproportionable that
half a Tribe should have treble the number of Cities to those that were
bigger. All we can say herein is this, that being a frontier Countrey,
and being exposed on the north and east to heathen enemies, it must
have more fenced Cities, then the Tribes on the other side <hi>Iordan,</hi> which
were better secured by their situation. Thus the hem is turned in, and
sowed double, to prevent the ravelling out thereof. And if I reck on right,
there be more Castles in our marches betwixt <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Wales,</hi> then in
all <hi>England</hi> besides. However, our eye shall not be evill at <hi>Manasseh</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
Gods was good unto it, who are so far from repining at, that we
rejoyce for the plenty of strong places therein; onely grieving that we
cannot give the Reader an exact account of their names, though we
will endevour our best in the following description.</p>
                  <p>§ 4. Mount <hi>Hermon</hi> is the north-east bound of this Tribe, called by
the <hi>Sidonians<note n="k" place="margin">Deut. 3. 9.</note> Syrion,</hi> by the <hi>Amorites Shenir,</hi> by humane<note n="l" place="margin">Prolemee <hi>&amp;</hi> Strabo.</note> writers <hi>Hippus,</hi>
and <hi>Trachones,</hi> being a branch of <hi>Lebanon</hi> bended south-ward. A stately
strong mountain fixed on firm foundations, and yet the <hi>voice of the Lord</hi>
(understand the thunder with an earthquake) maketh<note n="m" place="margin">Psal. 29. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Syrion to skip as
an Unicorne;</hi> and well may mountains dance when God himself shall
pipe unto them. The<note n="n" place="margin">Psal. 133. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>dew of Hermon</hi> is highly commended by <hi>David,</hi>
and brotherly love is compared thereunto, because (whilest heat of
hatred like a drought parcheth all to nothing) fraternall kindness dew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
gives refreshment and increase. But how this <hi>dew of Hermon fell upon
the hill of Sion</hi> (mountains an hundred miles asunder) so troubled Saint
<hi>Augustine,</hi> that at last leaving the literall sense, he is fain to fly to a mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
meaning. Others interpret that the <hi>dew of Hermon fell upon the hill of
Sion,</hi> because the fruitfull flocks fatted on that mountain came after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
to be sacrificed at <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> which is but a harsh construction;
as if one should say, <hi>The fruitfulness of Linconcolne-shire which falls on London,</hi>
because the fatted cattel thereof are sold and eaten in the City. But whilest
sundry Interpreters have severall wit-engines to draw these two moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
together, our last translation saves their needless paines, rendring it,
<hi>As the dew of Hermon, &amp; as</hi> as the dew <hi>that descended upon the mountains of Zion.</hi>
Indeed it is the same specificall, though not individuall dew which
lighteth on both mountains, flowing from heaven the same fountain,
though falling on earth in severall channels.</p>

                  <p>§ 6. South of <hi>Hermon</hi> lay mount <hi>Gilead,</hi> famous for the interview of
<hi>Laban</hi> and <hi>Iacob:</hi> the former keen with anger (save that God in a<note n="r" place="margin">Gen. 31. 24.</note> vision
took off his edge) overtaking <hi>Iacob</hi> charged him with a double action
of felony, for stealing himself, and his Gods away without his privity.
The first, <hi>Iacob</hi> confessed, yet pleaded not guilty to the second, but traver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
his innocency. <hi>Hue and Cry</hi> is made in vain after the thief and felons
goods, (or Gods if you please) for she, whose conscience would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
her to carry away, cunning did perswade her to conceal them. <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>
thus cleared (as it were by Proclamation) of Defendant turns Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffe,
accusing the Accuser for his false accusation. At last all winds off
in a good agreement, and an Instrument is drawn up betwixt them,
not in paper but in stone, interchangeably sealed with solemn oaths.
The Condition whereof, was to this effect; <hi>That if either of them should
passe that place to doe any act of hostility to other, he should forfeit his fidelity, and
be liable to divine justice for his perjury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 7. This Pillar and heap of stones had a threefold name imposed
on it, called

                        <item>1 By <hi>Laban,<note n="s" place="margin">Gen. 31. 47.</note> Iegar Sahadutha,</hi> that is in the <hi>Aramite</hi> tongue, <hi>A heap of

                        <item>3 By both <hi>Mizpah;</hi> that is, a <hi>Watch-tower, Iacob</hi> giving the name,

                  </p>
                  <p>Here was abundant caution, three names and two languages, and yet
nothing too much. For <hi>Iacob</hi> having formerly been sensible of <hi>Labans</hi>
notorious shuffling with him, knew the best way to finde sure was to
binde sure; and <hi>Laban</hi> being guilty, and therefore jealous, thought no
security sufficient. And therefore in their mutuall suspicions a Tripli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
was used in naming the places, that a threefold cable might not
be broken.</p>
                  <p>§ 8. <hi>Gilead</hi> was at first onely appropriated to that heap and pillar,
whence the name may seem to be translated to the adjacent mountains,
and thence transmitted to the valley in the east of those mountains, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48509:60"/>
thence imparted to some eminent persons born in that valley. For as

Thus as the<note n="y" place="margin">Psal. 49. 11.</note> Psalmist observes <hi>some called their lands after their own names,</hi>
and some it seems were called after the name of their lands.</p>
                  <p>§ 9. A fruitfull Countrey <hi>Gilead</hi> was, till the people thereof were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected

<hi>Their<note n="z" place="margin">Hos. 12. 11.</note> Altars were as heaps in the furrows of the field.</hi> Thus falling

being now<note n="e" place="margin">2 Sam. 19. 35.</note> fourscore years of age: having first bequeathed
his Court-pleasures to <hi>Chimham</hi> his Son (neither covetous to keep them

                  <p>We finde among these thirty cities, but one of them named, which is

                     <hi>Camon,</hi> wherein the body of <hi>Iair</hi> was buried. And it is probable, that

                  <p>§ 15. More south lay <hi>Ashteroth-karnaim,</hi> or in English, the <hi>two horned
Ashteroth,</hi> either so named from some forked building, or street therein;
<hi>(Horn-church</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> and <hi>Horn-castle</hi> in <hi>Lincolne-shire</hi> so called on the

her waxing or waning, was worshipped therein; or lastly because a
fair and gallant City, and all strength, mirth, and jollity are called <hi>horns</hi>
in the Hebrew. Yet may we say to the men of <hi>Ashteroth</hi> in the words of
the<note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 75. 5.</note> Psalmist, <hi>Set not up your horns so high, neither speak presumptuous words.</hi>

and neer which he bid battell to the children of <hi>Israel</hi> when he with all
his Giant-like race, which peopled this place, was extinguished. For

                     <hi>Land of Giants</hi> is a
Scripture-truth. However, no eye can now distinguish betwixt the ashes
of Giants, and dust of dwarfs, death having long since levelled all alike
in the grave.</p>
                  <p>§ 16. Such remarkable places as remain in this Tribe, will easily
be found out, if we follow the stream of <hi>Iordan,</hi> and such rivolets as pay
tribute thereunto. <hi>Iordan</hi> having newly recovered himself out of the

(whence the neighbouring countrey in <hi>Iosephus</hi> called <hi>Gaulonitis</hi>) and
after <hi>Iordan</hi> falleth betwixt <hi>Capernaum</hi> and <hi>Chorazin</hi> into <hi>the sea of Galilee.</hi>
This <hi>Chorazin</hi> was the place where Christs miracles and preaching were
sowen so thick; and where the peoples thankfulness for the one, and
practise of the other, came up so thin, that it caused that curse,<note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 11. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>Woe be to

silence in Scripture, as frequent mention in <hi>Iosephus,</hi> it is enough to
name them. In the last of these<note n="q" place="margin">Iud Ant. lib. 18. cap. 1.</note>

but a wall behind to support him, and <hi>his boughs</hi> (may Heralds
word it in their own language) <hi>grew over the wall.</hi> Partly foretelling the
fruitfulness of <hi>Iosephs</hi> posterity, and partly pointing at the particular posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion

of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> properly so called; and the children of <hi>Ioseph</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their root planted, and main body growing on the other side of
the river, spread their branches over this wall, half <hi>Manasseh</hi> having his

their Countrey in some sort may seem accessary to their felonies (the
Receiver is bad as a thief) which, as the foresaid Author observes, in

from justice proceeding against them. Insomuch that the <hi>Romans</hi> were

people therein were commixed with heathens, and (being far from
<hi>Ierusalem</hi>) were more drossie <hi>Iews</hi> then the rest. Which is a most errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

his Disciples to preach gave them instructions,<note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 10. 5.</note>

for the place of his principall and constant residence? Far more true is it
that it was called <hi>Galilaea Gentium,</hi> that is, <hi>Galilee</hi> the populous, because of
the multitudes of people, especially near the sea, wherein was <hi>Decapolis</hi>
(a member of <hi>Galilee.</hi>) And there one city, for want of room, may seem

strength, or greatness, as not so note-worthy in themselves as in
their situation. Because (though perchance otherwise poor villages)
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48509:66"/>
they stood in the borders of this Tribe. Thus low shrubs growing on
high hills, or crooked thorn-trees set by the high-way side, are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicuous

mountains of <hi>Libanus,</hi> we meet with one of eminent note, not onely
having a name peculiar to it self, but which from it hath also denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
the adjacent Countrey. This is mount <hi>Paneas,</hi> wherein there is a
deep hole or cave. And though places of this kind commonly have
more horrour then pleasure in them, this, besides its naturall beauty,
was adorned with artificiall structures in, and about it. Herein also was
an unsoundable spring of water, conceived by some to be the primitive
fountain of <hi>Iordan.</hi> Yet<note n="o" place="margin">Ios. de bell. Iuda. li. 3. <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Iosephus</hi> tells us of <hi>Phiala,</hi> a spring above two

was rendred up again in the streame of <hi>Iordan.</hi> Whence he concluded,
that this river entertained an underground intelligence with that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.
But we are not to take notice where rivers are secretly conceived,
but where they are visibly born: and therefore date the originall thereof
from the apparent heads of <hi>Ior</hi> and <hi>Dan:</hi> which keeping themselves sole
and single for a short time, are soon wedded together. And from the
confluence of their names and streams, <hi>Iordan</hi> is begotten.</p>

The erection of these Calves was pretended for the ease of the
people of <hi>Israel,</hi> to spare their tedious travell thrice a year to <hi>Ierusalem;</hi>
but in effect occasioned that they were sent a longer journey on a worse
errant, even into irrecoverable captivity. Thus to spare a step in the path

                  <p>§ 34. Others reade the resemblance in <hi>Barak,</hi> because Hindelike he was
so fearful to come out to war. But surely these blessings were give<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical
<hi>Iacob</hi> to his children as future badges of their honour, not brands
of their infamy, and therefore the similitude is to be sought not in the
disgracefull but commendable qualities of a Hinde, and more probably
to be fetch'd not from their fear but fleetness in severall performances.
Besides some conceive it too restrictive an interpretation of <hi>Iacobs</hi> bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
to confine it to any particular (though eminent) person, which
speakes rather the generall disposition of the whole Tribe, and may thus
more largely be expounded <hi>Naphtali is a Hinde.</hi> No ravenous or beast of

These caves (being only a cellar by nature) were by Art contrived into
severall rooms, and by industry fortified even unto admiration. So well
man'd, they could not be stormed, well victualled, they could not be

they could not be burned, so thick, they could not be battered, so high,
they could not be scaled, and so low, they could not be undermined.

                  <p>§ 8. But of all these Cities, <hi>Aphek</hi> was most remarkable, whose King
<note n="x" place="margin">Iosh. 12. 18.</note> was killed by <hi>Ioshua,</hi> and neer whereunto <hi>Benhadad</hi> (lately beaten by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hab</hi>
on the Mountains of <hi>Samaria</hi>) with his new model'd Army in a new
place hoped for new successe. For in stead of the thirty two<note n="y" place="margin">1 King. 20. 1.</note> Kings, of
more pomp then puissance to his Army, he placed so many Captaines,
seeing it is not the shining of the hilt, but the sharpnesse of the edge of
the sword must do the the deed. And resolved to fight in the Plain, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the Gods of the <hi>Israelites</hi> (though by <hi>Benhadads</hi> swelling words &amp;
lofty<note n="z" place="margin">1 King. 20. 10</note> language one might rather have collected the <hi>Syrian</hi> Gods to have
been) <hi>the Gods of the Mou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tains.</hi> Then appeared he with a mighty Host, against
whom the <hi>Israelites</hi> marched forth like <hi>two little flocks of</hi>

a wonder, the Kids kill the Wolves, and a hundred thousand <hi>Syrian</hi> foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
were kill'd in one day. From the field they flie into the City of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phek.</hi>
What, was it to try whether the God of <hi>Israel</hi> (concluded now God
of the Countrey, be it hilly or plain) were God of the City also? They
found it so by sad experience, when the wall of the City fell on twenty
and seven<note n="b" place="margin">1 King. 20 30.</note> thousand of them that were left, which wall if cruell to kill,
was charitable to bury them.</p>
                  <p>§ 9. Yet <hi>Ahab</hi> afterwards lost the advantage of this victory, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to Gods flat command, on <hi>Benhadads</hi> feigned submission he indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
life unto him, which caused his own death<note n="*" place="margin">1 King. 22. 31.</note> and destruction not long
after. Thus foolish pity, in stead of breaking, whets the knife for it's
own throat: and they who onely take out the teeth and sting of such ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents
which they should kill outright, shall finde the very stumps and
tail remaining enough to bite and sting them to death.</p>

them with the richest cost, and then either sell them to others to their
great profit, or weare them with as much pride themselves. They were

then ever, during the <hi>Persian</hi> Monarchy, about two hundred six years; till
<hi>Alexander</hi> the great made her change her tune, alter her notes, and turn

of that place, <hi>Alexander</hi> not so superstitious as ambitious, with vast pains
and expence (as one whom no perill could affright, nor labour weary)
sacked the City, putting such to the sword as resisted, and causing two
thousand moe to be hung up in rank on the sea shore. At which time
he built a Castle of his own name (now corruptly called <hi>Sandalium</hi>)

                     <hi>Elon</hi> a peaceable Judge, and <hi>Ionah</hi> an
eminent Prophet. But what shall we say? <hi>A greater then Ionah was here,</hi>
even Christ himself, the honour and dishonour (though not of the tribe)
of the land of <hi>Zebulun:</hi> honor, because here miraculously conceived, poorly
&amp; painfully bread &amp; brought up, here frequent in preaching &amp; working
of miracles: dishonour, because carelesly neglected and scornfully

                  <p>§ 2. <hi>Zebulun</hi> had <hi>Asher</hi> on the north-west,<note place="margin">The situation and sea conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences thereof.</note> 
                     <hi>Naphtali</hi> on the north-east,
<hi>Issachar</hi> on the south, the Mediterranean on the west, and <hi>Galilean</hi> sea on
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48509:83"/>
the east thereof. This maritime position of this Tribe <hi>Iacob</hi> foresaw in his
Prophecy,<note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 49. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the Sea, and he shall be for an
haven of ships, and his border shall be unto Zidon.</hi> Which Charter of sea con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies
is renewed, and enlarged by <hi>Moses</hi> in his blessing, <hi>Rejoyce
<note n="h" place="margin">Deut. 33. 18, 19.</note> Zebulun in thy going out, and Issachar in thy tents. They shall call the people unto
the mountains, and there shall they offer Sacrifices of righteousness, for they shall
suck of the abundance of the Seas, and treasures hid in the sand.</hi> Where though
these two Tribes be made Partners, and joint sharers in marine interests,
and are promised equall profit thereby, yet <hi>Issachar</hi> it seems loved land
and an home life best, imploying his canvase rather for <hi>Tents,</hi> then <hi>Sails,</hi>
whilest the sea and <hi>going out</hi> in long voiages was rather <hi>Zebuluns</hi> delight.
So have I seen chickens and ducklings hatched under the same hen,
no sooner unhoused out of their shels, but presently the one falls a pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

                  <p>§ 3. Nor let any be staggered at the close of <hi>Iacobs</hi> Prophecy,<note place="margin">Zebulun <hi>how bordering on</hi> Sidon.</note> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

fall many miles short and south of that place. For <hi>Sidon</hi> is not there to
be taken for the City but Countrey<note n="k" place="margin">Bochar. Geog. Sacr. par. pri. pag. 342.</note> so named. And the land of the
<hi>Sidonians</hi> or <hi>Phenicians,</hi> extended to <hi>Accho</hi> or <hi>Ptolemais</hi> a city thereof, on
which the north bound of <hi>Zebulun</hi> did confine. Greater will be the
difficulty to assigne a cleare reason, why in the <hi>first book of Chronicles,</hi>
where the Pedegrees of all the other Tribes are reckoned up; <hi>Zebulun</hi>
and <hi>Dan</hi> (as considerable and deserving as the rest) is omitted. The
best is, places not persons concern our present subject, and I hope I shall
not betray such indiscretion to leave the plain and ready Rode of my
work in hand, to enter into the wood (not to say the bog) of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent

                  <p>And here, amongst the many voyages of our Saviour (who often
crossed the length and breadth of this sea-lake) let us take account of
some most remarkable. And first in generall we may observe, that after
the working of some extraordinary miracle, (which might have great
influence on peoples affections) as the feeding of so many thousands,
Christ presently put to sea (clouding himself in obscurity) and shun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
popularity so far, that it should venture a drowning, if offering to
follow after him.</p>
                  <p>§ 6. The first voyage we will insist on,<note place="margin">Christs first voyage.</note> was when our Saviour sailed
in <hi>Simons</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Luke 5. 7.</note> ship, who formerly had fished all night, getting nothing
save a drowzie head and empty hands, untill casting his net at Christs
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48509:84"/>
command, he caught such store of fish, both his and his partners ship
began to sink. O when will any earthly thing fall out even to our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires!
We always finde fish, either none at all, or too many; and a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit
of wealth is as dangerous as a famine thereof. The fish were now
ready to return into the water from whence they came, and not by their
wit, but weight had caught their fishermen, had not Christ by miracle
brought all safe to shore.</p>
                  <p>§ 7. A second when the Disciples put to sea at the command,<note place="margin">The second voyage saves <hi>Peter.</hi>
                     </note> but
without the person of their Master. Tossed they were on the waves,
rowing with great pains to little purpose, <hi>for the wind was contrary,</hi> till
looking at last<note n="b" place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>t. 14. 24.</note> they see <hi>Iesus</hi> walking on the water; Then were the
words of the Psalmist literally true,<note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 77. 19.</note> 
                     <hi>Thy way is in the Sea, and thy path in the
great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.</hi> The Disciples unable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
such a mystery conclude it was a Ghost. It is not worth our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
what Ghost, or whence, good or evill, of man or devill, this wild
guess being the effect of their fright, then which no more professed foe to
a cleare judgment. Christ quickly discovering himself, <hi>Peter</hi> requests a
commission to meet him: which granted, he walks for a while on the
water, till his Faith first, then feet failing him, he began to answer the
name of <hi>Cephas,</hi> proving himself a <hi>stone,</hi> not by the stability, but the
heaviness thereof, <hi>and began to sink,</hi> till Christ saved him. Nor was
Christ sooner in the ship, but the ship was<note n="d" place="margin">Iohn 6. 21.</note> at the land. Thus those
many strokes at the oares which the Disciples had taken before, were
not meerly lost, but onely laid up, and now restored them in their speedy
arrivall. Yea the sails of the ship were not now on the mast, but in
the keel thereof, Christs person did the deed. Thus projects driven on
without Gods gracious presence are but driven on, whilest such designes
fly to their wished end, which take God along with them.</p>
                  <p>§ 8. The third and last voyage we will insist on,<note place="margin">The third voyage when Christ was fast a sleep.</note> was when the ship
was not upon but under the sea,<note n="e" place="margin">Mat. 8. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>covered with the waves.</hi> Yea, <hi>it was now
full of<note n="f" place="margin">Mark. 4. 3. 7.</note> water,</hi> and the Disciples of fear, whilest Christ him self was fast a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sleep,
having a pillow under his head, and a softer under his heart, a clear
conscience. See we here our Saviour a perfect, because an imperfect
Man, his infirmities speake the reality of his humanity. Working had
made him weary, weariness had caused him to sleep much out of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
to be refreshed, more out of a designe to be awaked. Here all cry out,
<hi>Master save us, we perish.</hi> Danger will make the profane to pray, the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full-dumbe
to speak, who will finde a tongue, rather then lose a life.
No doubt <hi>Iudas</hi> himselfe, who afterwards sold him, was now
as clamorous as any to be saved by him. Christ awakes, and rebukes
first the Disciples<note n="g" place="margin">Mar. 4. 39, 40.</note> for being too fearfull, and despairing, then the winds
and waves, for being too bold and presumptuous. Both obey, owning
their Creatours voice; as well may his words, who made them at first,
make them now to be quiet.</p>

when after the feeding of so many thousands, they had but <hi>one<note n="h" place="margin">Mar. 8. 14.</note> loafe in
the ship,</hi> and on our Saviours caveat of the leaven of the Pharisees, their
jealousies grew solicitous for food. Had they not besides that one loafe
in their Cup-board, twelve moe in their memory (five at one batch,
and seven at another) on the recollection whereof their mindes might
feed, to depend on providence, especially whilest the founder of the
feast was in their company. But we who condemne them, are too likely
to commit the like distrust, if left to our selves, upon less occasion. To
return to our Saviour, it is observable that after his resurrection, we
read not that he sailed any more upon the Seas. For such a fluctuating
and turbulent condition, which necessarily attends sea-voyages, was
utterly inconsistent with the constancy, stability, and perpetuity of
Christs estate when risen from the grave. The firme land therefore
better agreeing with his fixed and immoveable happiness, thereon he
stood, and onely gave the word of command to his disciples at Sea, on
which side they should cast forth their net, when they caught so<note n="i" place="margin">Iohn 21 4.</note> many
fishes. And so much for the <hi>Sea of Tiberias,</hi> hoping that if the weakly
reader be sea-sick by staying so long on the water, he will instantly be
well upon our arrivall on the main land, to which now we proceed.</p>

We will follow the chanells of those rivers, which will direct
us to the most considerable places in <hi>Zebulun;</hi> beginning with <hi>little

he sucked his first breath in <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where his mother lived till
very near the time of her delivery. Also here he afterwards had his
poor and painfull education, working on his Fathers trade (as it is
probable from the words of the Evangelist,<note n="*" place="margin">Mar. 6. 3.</note>

of their<note n="s" place="margin">Numb 6. 2.</note> vow were tied to many ceremonious observances. Whereas

<list>
                        <item>1 <hi>He closed his book.</hi> Not in any vaine ostentation of his memory;
but because either his Auditours were so well versed in the
letter of the Scripture, that they could tell by heart any
quotation he should cite therein: or rather, because out
of his fulness of divine knowledge and wisedome, himself had
no more need of it; and he would thereby fasten the more
their eares, and his tongue to that one text which was of so maine
concernment and importance unto them.</item>
                        <item>2 <hi>And he gave it againe to the Minister.</hi> Of him he received, to him he
restored it, and coming in <hi>Reader</hi> by his leave, he would not
undermine the <hi>Incumbent,</hi> of the place, but honoured him in the

But thus fixing their eyes to help their attention, and express their longing
desire to know how he would interpret that famous place of Scripture;
as also for the fame that they had heard of him, who without study and
ordinary meanes became so incomparable a Teacher<note n="*" place="margin">John 7. 15.</note>. And yet curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>osity
as much as true devotion may seem to cause this their attention;
seeing they who out of novelty were ready to eate his words, soon after
out of cruelty were more ready to devoure the speaker, contemning
him for the poverty of his parentage, person and kindred, and hating
him for the truth he delivered, <hi>that a Prophet is not without honour but in his
own Countrey.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 15. How this comes to pass,<note place="margin">Why Prophets without ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour in their own countrey.</note> let others largely dispute. We may in
briefe conclude, it is partly because their cradles can be remembred,
and those swadling-cloathes, once used about them, to strengthen them
whilest infants, are afterwards abused against them, to disgrace them
when men, and all the passages of their childhood repeated to their
disparagement. Partly because all the faults of their family (which
must be many in a numerous alliance) are charged on the Prophets
account. Wherefore that Prophet who comes at the first in full growth
from a far forein place (not improving himselfe amongst them
from a small spark, to a fire, to a flame; but sunlike arising in perfect
lustre) gaines the greatest reputation amongst people: Because in some
respect he is like <hi>Melchisedek,<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 7. 3.</note> without Father, without Mother, without de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scent,</hi>
whilst the admiring vulgar, transported with his preaching, and
ignorant of his extraction on earth, will charitably presume his Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
from heaven, and his breeding, as calling, to be divine.</p>

he penetrated contrary to the nature of a body, thorow the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
breasts of the people, but that either he smote them with blindness,
that they did not see, or else struck them with fear, that they dared not
to stay him, the power of his Person wedge-like cleaving its way, and
forcing a lane for his passage in the midst of the people.</p>

his history with improbable tales of <hi>Moses</hi> loving the Lady <hi>Tarbith &amp;c.</hi>
and some mistakes contradictory to holy writ. When we meet with
any such in him relating to this present work, we have made bold (the
Sun is not to be set by dials, but dials by the Sun) to alter and rectifie his
extravagancies according to Scripture. Notwithstanding all these faults,
the main bulk of his book deserves commendation, if not admiration;
no doubt at the first compiled, and since preserved by the speciall provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of God, to reflect much light and lustre upon the Scriptures. His
last book <hi>De bello Iudaico</hi> is the best Comment on that part of the twenty
fourth Chapter of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> which concerns the destruction of the
City and Temple. As for the censure of <hi>Baronius,</hi> it is too harsh and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable,
charging him with<note n="w" place="margin">In Apparatu, numero 84.</note>

be a <hi>City of refuge</hi> to such Authors, who rather unhappy, then unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,

                     </note> none more eminent
then the streets built therein by the King of <hi>Syria.</hi> A thing scarce to be
paralleled, that a forein King should be permitted to erect streets in the
Metropolitan City of another Kingdome. If any alledge that <hi>Peter Earl
of Savoy</hi> built his palace in the Strand (known by the name of <hi>Savoy</hi> at
this day) and that there is a street betwixt <hi>Aldersgate</hi> and <hi>Smithfield</hi> called
<hi>Britons street,</hi> from the ancient lodgings of the <hi>Duke of Britain</hi> therein;
neither of the instances amount to the matter in hand. The former pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
being erected, as I take it, for the Earles abode here when in banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
And as for the latter, it appears not that the <hi>Dukes of Britain</hi> were
at any cost in building it: whereas the Kings of <hi>Syria</hi> founded the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brickes
of those streets in the city of <hi>Samaria,</hi> and never inhabited therein.
It seems when <hi>Omri</hi> began the new building of <hi>Samaria,</hi> either he request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the assistance of the King of <hi>Syria</hi> (as a neighbouring Prince in amity
with him) to help him in the work; (no shame to beg the first clouts of
friends, for an infant-city) or else the <hi>Syrian</hi> Kings civilly tendered their
service, to give it as good handsell to so good a work, or as a <hi>Royall Largess</hi>
amongst the inferiour builders thereof. For mine own part I conceive
that the Kings of <hi>Damascus,</hi> got some conquest of <hi>Samaria</hi> not mentioned
in Scripture, and then built these streets, as a monument of their victory
and bridle to over-awe the city. The rather because <hi>Benhadad</hi> being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
overcome by <hi>Ahab</hi> profered the like favour and freedome unto
him, if it pleased him to accept thereof,<note n="y" place="margin">1 Kin. 20. 34.</note>

                  <p>§ 27. We meet in Scripture with three famous sieges of <hi>Samaria.</hi>

Once when <hi>Benhadad</hi> not content with <hi>Ahabs</hi> submission, (profering
to hold all he had by homage from him) would have all the wealth of
the city <hi>in specie</hi> surrendered unto him, vainly vaunting that<note n="z" place="margin">1 King. 20. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>the dust of

the Scavengers were very diligent in sweeping so populous a place, or
else it was a most hyperbolicall expression. But grant <hi>Samaria</hi> could not
yeeld dust enough to fill the hands, the mountains near unto it could
afford dirt enough to stop the mouths of most of his army, who few
days after were thereon miraculously<note n="a" place="margin">1 King. 20. 21.</note> defeated.</p>

fewell, and surely not to drain peter to make powder thence, an inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
unknown in that age. Nor was the sudden plenty, occasioned by
the <hi>Syrians</hi> flight, less admirable, all provision being brought down in
an instant to a very unexpected low price. So that he that here knew
beforehand what would be cheap or dear, needed but a few minutes to
make him a rich Merchant. But this showre of plenty caused a floud of
people to flock to the gates of <hi>Samaria,</hi> where that infidell Prince, who
despaired of Gods power and <hi>Elisha's</hi> prophecy, was<note n="b" place="margin">2 King. 7. 17.</note> overwhelmed in
the multitude; living so long to have his eyes confute his tongue, but
not to have his taste confirme his eyes; beholding, but not partaking of
the plenty.</p>

                  <p>The difficulty is this; the dogs licked the bloud of <hi>Ahab at Samaria</hi>

                     <hi>Iezreel,</hi> twenty miles and more north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
To reconcile which difference, <hi>Rabbi Salomon</hi> conceives that
though <hi>Ahabs</hi> chariot was washed at <hi>Samaria,</hi> his armour was washed
at <hi>Iezreel,</hi> where (saith he) the royall armory was kept. Others fancy
an out-let of the poole of <hi>Samaria</hi> in the river <hi>Kison,</hi> which many miles
off glided by the vineyard of <hi>Naboth,</hi> so that his bloud might be carried
thither down the stream. Lastly, it is generally answered, that those
words, <hi>In the place,</hi> are not to be taken restrictively for the same numeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
spot of ground, but extensively for the same Land, countrey, and
kingdome, which then was fulfilled according to the Prophets predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Not to say, that some understand, <hi>In the place where the dogs licked,</hi> that
is, <hi>pro eo quod, in stead, in lieu,</hi> or <hi>in requitall</hi> of thy cruelty, <hi>dogs shall lick thy

that the very make, and fashion of these mountains (pick'd out by
Gods providence for that purpose) might advantage much the articulate

Besides, the people knew before hand, the very numericall words, both
of the blessings, and cursings, which the Levites were to pronounce, and
this rendred their voice intelligible at the greater distance. For, our eares
and eyes quickly own those objects far off, with which formerly they
have been familiarly acquainted. Lastly, the Levites uttered no long
continued orations, but short speeches severally distinguished, with the
full periods of the peoples <hi>Amen,</hi> which gave fair notice to their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours

called his money <hi>his sword and his bow.</hi> And indeed

                        <item>2 That thereby he meant his prayers (the Armes of the
Patriarchs and Primitive Christians) whereby he
obtained of God, that his posterity being now in
his loins, in due time should by their martiall atchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
conquer the countrey; and speakes of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest
as already made, because of the undoubted assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance

industry and endevours. Thus the Latine phrase, <hi>Fecit
proprio marte,</hi> carrieth a warlike sound, but a peaceable
sense, when one acquires a thing, though in a legall way
<hi>with his own might,</hi> without the assistance of others, as

                  <p>§ 52. This <hi>Dothan</hi> I take to be the very place,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Dothan</hi> where <hi>Ioseph</hi> was sold by his brethren</note> where <hi>Ioseph</hi> found his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
and there was put into the pit, and sold to the Merchants. For being
sent by his Father to<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 37. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Shechem,</hi> he was by a man directed to <hi>Dothan,</hi> whither
his brethren had removed their flocks, and which probably was not
far off, but some few miles from the former place. Wherefore, when for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
in the description of <hi>Zebulun,</hi> we placed <hi>Dothan</hi> in the northern
parts of that Tribe, threescore miles from <hi>Shechem,</hi> therein we were carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
away with the common current of other mens judgements, and now
have watched our advantage to swim back again, and shew our private
opinion in the position thereof. And besides the aforesaid text, setling
<hi>Dothan</hi> near <hi>Shechem</hi> in this Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> it is proportionable to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
providence, that the place whereon <hi>Ioseph</hi> was betrayed, and pit
wherein he was put, should in after ages fall to the possession of the sons
of <hi>Ephraim</hi> descended from him.</p>
                  <p>§ 53. But here a materiall Question will be started,<note place="margin">How this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey was called the land of the Hebrews.</note> how <hi>Ioseph</hi> could
properly say, that <hi>he was stolen away out of the<note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 40. 15.</note> land of the Hebrews;</hi> when
the Hebrews at that time, <hi>had none inheritance in it, no not so<note n="g" place="margin">Act. 7. 5.</note> much as to set
their foot on?</hi> Say not that <hi>Ioseph</hi> being a child when taken away might be
allowed to speak incongruously; for we behold his words as uttered
by him when a man. And surely he, who then could expound dreames,
could express himself in proper language. Some conceive it was termed
<hi>the Land of the Hebrews,</hi>
                     <list>
                        <item>1 From those few Hebrews, the family of <hi>Iacob,</hi> living there, though

                        <item>2 It was the <hi>Land of the Hebrews</hi> by promise, and in due time should
be theirs by possession.</item>
                        <item>3 <hi>The Land of the Hebrews,</hi> though not in linage, in language; the
<hi>Canaanites</hi> speaking the same tongue with <hi>Iacobs</hi> family.</item>
                        <item>4 Some conceive this land anciently belonged to <hi>Heber,</hi> (as all <hi>Asia</hi>

time encroached on that Countrey.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>To strengthen this last conjecture, we must remember that <hi>Melchise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dech
King of Salem,</hi> who generally is conceived to be <hi>Shem,</hi> the ancestour
of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> still retained his<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 14. 18.</note> kingdome in the land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> And
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48509:113"/>
it might be that the other Hebrews were ejected by the <hi>Canaanites.</hi> If so,
the <hi>Israelites</hi> afterwards got the land under <hi>Ioshua</hi> by a double Right, of
Conquest, and Recovery.</p>

                  <p>§ 4. This Countrey was bounded with <hi>Ephraim</hi> on the north, <hi>Iudah</hi>
on the east, <hi>Simeon</hi> on the south, and the <hi>Mid-land-sea</hi> on the west. From
above <hi>Lydda</hi> to the brook <hi>Soreck,</hi> some thirty miles; and litle less east and
west, from the sea to the edge of <hi>Iudah.</hi> A land at the best, but half <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah's</hi>
leavings, and that not entirely possessed of the <hi>Danites.</hi> For herein
the <hi>Amorites</hi> did both cut and chuse for themselves, reserving the fat
and flesh thereof, (all the fruitfull<note n="g" place="margin">Iudg 1. 34.</note> valley) for their own use, whilest
the <hi>Danites</hi> were glad to pick the bones, crowded up into the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.
Besides, three of the <hi>Satrapies</hi> of the <hi>Philistines,</hi> are found in this
Tribe; A puissant nation, and at deadly fewd with the people of <hi>Israel.</hi>
This put the <hi>Danites</hi> on the necessity (men over-pent will some way
vent themselves) of seeking new Quarters,<note place="margin">Iosh. 19. 47.</note> in that their memorable expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,

<hi>Leshemites,</hi> pursie with long peace, then to undertake those two
warlike nations, well breathed daily in military Discipline: And
<note n="*" place="margin">Gen 49. 17. Deut. 33. 22.</note> sudden surprisals were foretold in this Tribe.</p>
                  <p>§ 5. But grant the measure in this Tribe but short, the ware
thereof was very fine, the Countrey being passing fruitfull in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities.
Herein grew that <hi>bunch of Grapes</hi> of prodigious greatness,
in gathering whereof, by the hand of the spies sent to search the
Land, the <hi>Israelites</hi> took Livery and Seisin of the fruits of the
Countrey. Besides, this Tribe did drive some <hi>sea-trade (Deborah</hi>
complains, <hi>Why did Dan<note n="h" place="margin">Iud. 5. 17.</note> remain in ships?</hi>) though the <hi>Iews</hi> gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
were mean Mariners and Merchants. Partly because the fat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of their soile so stuck by their sides, it unactived them for
forein adventures: and natures bounty unto them gave their indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry
a <hi>Writ of ease</hi> to sit at home. And partly because, being divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
(as an Island from the Continent of the World) in Religion
from other Countries, it cut off their comfortable commerce with
other nations: though since their wofull Posterity have proved the
Capemerchants of the world.</p>

Where though the <hi>Amorites</hi> dwelt in despight of the <hi>Danites,</hi> yet the
Tribe of <hi>Ephraim</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">Iudg. 1. 35.</note> made them tributaries. A little further, this high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
takes its farewell of the Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> but with full intent
shortly to visite it again. For having passed over a corner of
<hi>Ephraim,</hi> which baggeth into the south, it returns into <hi>Dan,</hi>
and goes forward by <hi>Modin,</hi> the City of <hi>Mattathias</hi> and his sons,
where the seven<note n="b" place="margin">1 Macc. 13. 27, 28, 29.</note> sepulchers of the <hi>Maccabees</hi> (each a high Pyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mid

conspicuous sea-mark to the Mariners many miles distant. Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
monuments, which being erected for the honour of the
dead, are imployed for the safety of the living! Few miles
hence this high-way finally leaves this Tribe. And therefore
we leave it, onely wishing the passengers therein a prosperous
journey to <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> That such as goe thither about business may
dispatch the same to their own contentment; such as travell
out of curiosity may have their expectation so satisfied, as to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervaile
all their paines and charges: and such as goe thither out
of <hi>superstitious opinion to merit,</hi> may have their erroneous judgements
better rectified and informed.</p>
                  <p>§ 10. Nor doth ought else observable offer it self in this corner
of the Tribe, save<note n="*" place="margin">Iosh. 21. 24. Iosh. 10. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Aijalon,</hi> (where <hi>Ioshua's</hi>

of the<note n="c" place="margin">Iud. 1. 34.</note> Scripture, <hi>And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the
mountaines: for they would not suffer them to come down into the valley, but
the Amorites would dwell in mount Herez, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim.</hi>
The genuine sense is, that though the <hi>Amorites</hi> generally pent the
<hi>Danites</hi> up in the mountains; yet in these three places (though
mountainous in their situation) they crossed their common custome;
not out of necessity, but designe, as sensible of their own profit
that these transcended the vallies in fertility, and therefore placed
themselves therein. Let others dispute, how it came to pass, that
the <hi>Priests,</hi> whom God intended <hi>men of peace,</hi> by their profession,
had a controversiall City appointed them, incumbred with enemies
so that they must win it before they could wear it. As also how
the <hi>Levites</hi> could live, when the Land allotted them, was seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred
in the hand of a forein foe. It will be for enough us to observe, that
in all ages the <hi>Church</hi> being imbarked in the same bottome with the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:48509:121"/>
                     <hi>State</hi> ran an equall hazard therein, according to her proportion. And
when the whole Tribe of <hi>Dan,</hi> like the <hi>Parish in generall,</hi> was strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in its processions, well might the <hi>Priests</hi> maintenance be abated
accordingly.</p>
                  <p>§ 11. We goe back now to <hi>Ioppa,</hi> where standing on the rocks,
an indifferent fight may easily discern those ships, into which the
heathen people of <hi>Ioppa,</hi> with much courtesie, but more craft,
invited the <hi>Iews</hi> with their wives and their children to goe aboard:
for they made them pay their lives the fraight for their voyage, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully

two hundred and fourty furlongs off, as far as <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> A thing
not incredible, that fire it self should be seen so far, by the light
whereof other things in darkness are discovered, especially when
mounted high on its throne, with the advantage of pitch, cordage,

Except any will say, they did not so much fear the depth of
the river, as the height of the banks of the other side, to wit, the

Great is the difference betwixt the same sea, at <hi>high and low water
mark:</hi> and so this Countrey must needs be much disproportioned to it
self, when extended in a <hi>full tyde,</hi> and when contracted in a <hi>low

                  <p>§ 15. In this Countrey of <hi>Makats Bethshemesh</hi> was a principall
City, belonging to the <hi>Levites,</hi> and reputed part of <hi>Iudah,</hi> but (except
some Labell of land tacked to <hi>Iudah</hi>) surrounded about with the
Tribe of <hi>Dan.</hi> A case obvious in the dividing of Countreys. Who knows
not how <hi>Worcester-shire</hi> hath speckled all the adjacent Counties with

For as their chiefe Cities had Kings over them, which seem abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute

the fertility of their soil. Some of these Giants had their hands branching

some but a forced interpretation. For what unlikelyhood was it, that

if there were such, to be attendants about his body? Not to instance in
the <hi>French Kings</hi> double gard of <hi>Scots,</hi> and <hi>Switzars,</hi> as improper to this

It would incline me to the more charitable side, that he had
good warrant for what he did, because at the same time (understand it

his soul not out of tune solemnly to serve God. But <hi>David</hi> went to <hi>Achish</hi>
a second time, with sixe hundred men; (it seems upon better assurance
before-hand, then formerly) and was with great kindness entertained
by him, dwelt with him in <hi>Gath,</hi> and after obtained <hi>Ziklag</hi> from him;
and by <hi>Achish</hi> his minde should have been the<note n="*" place="margin">1 Sam. 27. 2, 3 5, 6. &amp; 2. 82.</note> keeper of his head. <hi>Achish</hi>
the son of <hi>Maachah</hi> (tributary no doubt to <hi>Solomon</hi>) was King of <hi>Gath.</hi> For

of his valour (Love and Loyalty never give scant measure)
that he<note n="c" place="margin">1 Sam. 18. 27.</note> doubled the number. And what injustice was it that he that

had an undoubted right derived unto him by Gods grant, not onely to

whence the men of <hi>Iudah</hi> brought him down, bound with two cords,
and delivered him to the <hi>Philistines:</hi> but he presently found his spirits,
and in that place the jaw-bone of an Asse. Bad weapons are better
then none; and it matters not what they be, so that they be
weilded by <hi>Samsons</hi> arme, that, guided by Gods hand. This jaw-bone
which used to feed on grass, here eat up a<note n="w" place="margin">Iudg. 15. 15.</note> thousand men. Hereupon
the place was called <hi>Rama-Lehi, the lifting up of a jawbone.</hi>

brag of <hi>Hippocrene,</hi> a fountain from a horses hoof; most true it is that a

(which indeed is most probable) not to take <hi>Lehi</hi> in Hebrew for the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall

must have some Preachers to instruct them, and afford those Preachers
maintenance for their instruction. At <hi>Gerar,</hi> the brook <hi>Bezor</hi> receives

from the south a Tributary rivolet, fetching its fountain out of the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness

Modern traveller, to shew how the Countrey hereabouts, even at this

this day through the most pregnant and pleasant valley, that ever eye beheld. On the

the Mediterranean Sea bordered with continued hills, beset with variety of fruits.
The Champion between about twenty miles over, full of flowry hills ascending leasure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and not much surmounting their ranker vallies, with groves of Olives and other

considerable time in these parts, seeing trees grow not up as <hi>Ionas his

But what was piety in <hi>Abraham</hi> in planting this grove, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faneness
in his posterity to imitate. For after that God had made choice
of a fixed place (Tabernacle, or Temple) <hi>to put his name there,</hi> such as
elsewhere sacrificed unto him were not onely guilty of Schisme (sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
themselves from the publick worship) but flat Idolatry, serving
the true God in a false manner, namely, in a place prohibited. And
now it is seasonably remembred, that many ages after, <hi>Beersheba</hi> was an

It being probable that as the<note n="u" place="margin">2 King. 18. 4.</note> brazen serpent set up by <hi>Moses,</hi> was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
abused to Idolatry, so this grove of <hi>Abrahams</hi> planting near

§ 14. But the City of <hi>Beersheba</hi> it self stood hard by on the brook
<hi>Bezor.</hi> The name imports, <hi>The well of an oath.</hi> First so called from<note n="w" place="margin">Gen. 21. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams,</hi>
then from<note n="x" place="margin">Gen. 26. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>Isaac's</hi> ceremonious swearing and covenanting with
<hi>Abimelech</hi> in that place. Now if Scarlet keep colour because twice died,
and therefore called <hi>Dibaphon,</hi> well might <hi>Beersheba</hi> retain her
name, twice on the same occasion imposed upon it.<note n="y" place="margin">Gen. 46. 4.</note> Here God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted
<hi>Iacob</hi> in his journey down into <hi>Egypt,</hi> promising him safety and
sight of his son <hi>Ioseph.</hi> Many hundred years after, <hi>Samuel</hi> at<note n="z" place="margin">1 Sam. 8. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Beersheba</hi>
set up his Sons for Judges, who degenerated from their Fathers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity.
In the division of the land into two kingdomes, <hi>Beersheba</hi>
belonged to <hi>Iudah,</hi> where<note n="a" place="margin">2 Chr. 19. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Iehoshaphat</hi> set up Judges, and whither
<note n="b" place="margin">1 King. 19. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Eliah</hi> persecuted by <hi>Iezebel</hi> fled for succour. Hence he fled into the
wilderness, leaving his servant at <hi>Beersheba.</hi> Not that he carelesly cast
him off, but as the case stood with <hi>Eliah,</hi> life was to be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
attendance, and one alone might shift with more secrecy then two
together. Besides, by the avoidance of this servant (probably no person
of extraordinary performance) divine providence made a way for <hi>Elisha</hi>
(one of more desert) in this vacancy to be inducted into <hi>Eliah's</hi> service.</p>
                  <p>§ 15. Coming still west-ward on the bank of <hi>Bezor,</hi> we finde
the place where two hundred of <hi>Davids</hi> foot being faint stayed with
the<note n="c" place="margin">1 Sam. 30. 10.</note> baggage, whilest the rest of their brethren pursued and conquered
the <hi>Amalekites.</hi> But these at their return denyed the two hundred stay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
by the brook, any part of their spoile, till <hi>David</hi> ordered it as
<hi>a leading case,</hi> that these which attended the baggage should be equall
sharers with such who fought in the battell. And very good reason:
<list>
                        <item>1 It was not laziness, but weariness kept them behinde. A stout
heart sometimes cannot help a fainting body. Wherefore to
punish sickness in them for a sin, had been height of tyranny.</item>
                        <item>2 Grant their tired bodies could not keep pace with their souls, yet
no doubt in desire they marched along with their brethren, and
perchance by their prayers facilitated their victory.</item>
                        <item>3 During their staying behind, their imployment was as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary,
though not so honourable. The stuffe could not secure it
self, and the keeping of it in the others absence was a good piece
of defensive service.</item>
                     </list>
Now from hence it appears, that in cases not provided for in the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall
Law, the Princes of <hi>Israel</hi> were intrusted with power to enact
Statutes, in a prudentiall proportion to Gods word, binding all in
their dominions to the observation of them. This ordinance of <hi>David</hi>
may from the place be termed the <hi>Statute of Bezor.</hi> Nor is it any news
for Laws to be made in open fields by rivers sides, our <hi>English</hi> Laws
having had their birth in so plain a place in <hi>Ronny-mede</hi> near the river
of Thames, where King <hi>Iohn</hi> and his <hi>Barons</hi> first drew them up together.
Yea, no fitter place for such solmn acts then a rivers side, where the sight
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:48509:131"/>
thereof may be the remembrancer, <hi>that</hi>
                     <note n="d" place="margin">Amos 5. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Iudgement may run down as waters,
and righteousness as a mighty stream.</hi> Hence <hi>Bezor</hi> glideth into the Land of the
<hi>Philistines,</hi> whither in due time we will follow it.</p>
                  <p>§ 16. South of this brook lay the wilderness of <hi>Beersheba,</hi> often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in Scripture. Herein <hi>Hagar</hi> and<note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 21. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>Ishmael</hi> wandred when the bottle
of water was spent, the last Legacy which <hi>Abraham</hi> bequeathed him. Oh
how she weeps, as if intending to refill the same from her eyes! but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lass, that moisture so brackish would rather increase then allay any thirst.
And now what should she do? It was death to her to see her son die, and
yet that pity which would not suffer her to tarry by him, would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
her to depart from him. In this <hi>Dilemma</hi> of affection she resolves on
the distance of a bow-shoot,<note n="r" place="margin">Gen. 21. 16.</note> as a competent mean betwixt presence and
absence, and disposeth her self under one shrub, her son under another.
Here <hi>Ishmael</hi> cryes and God heareth. The very worst in extreme want are
the object of pity, and though <hi>Ishmael</hi> had mockes for <hi>Isaac,</hi> heaven had
mercy for <hi>Ishmael.</hi> An Angel sent shews <hi>Haga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> a fountain, not now new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
created, but newly discovered to her sight. The object was there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
but the Organ not rightly disposed to behold it. How near may
men be to their own happiness and miss it; touching it, yet not seeing it,
till God open their eyes! More south in this wilderness was the <hi>Iuniper-tree</hi>
under which<note n="g" place="margin">1 King. 19. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Elisha</hi> sate so highly discontented. Coales of Juniper
we know are extremely hot, but is there any secret quality in the shade
of that tree, to put <hi>Eliah,</hi> sitting under, into such passions, as that nothing
but death would please him for the present? Sorrow bought him asleep,
and afterwards awaking, being refreshed with a cake of bread, cruse of
water, and comfort of an Angel he undertook his journey to <hi>Horeb.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 17. Not far off betwixt <hi>Kadesh</hi> and <hi>Bered</hi> is <hi>Beer-laha-roi,</hi> that is, <hi>the
well of him that liveth and seeth:</hi> so<note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 16. 14.</note> named by <hi>Hagar,</hi> because there an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel
catechised, comforted, and counselled her to return and humble her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to <hi>Sarah</hi> her mistress. By this well <hi>Isaac</hi> was walking and meditating,<note n="i" place="margin">Gen. 24. 62.</note>
when <hi>Rebekah</hi> brought from her Fathers house first met him, in her
most modest behaviour. For at the sight of him, though at some di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,
she<note n="k" place="margin">Gen. 24. 64.</note> lighted from her Camel, counting it ill manners to ride, when
her husband and master went a foot: as also to give an earnest of her fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
good housewifery, that she would prefer industry before ease, honest
pain before pleasure. The she<note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 24. 65.</note> vailed her self, partly to shew that the beams
of her beauty were hereafter to be appropriated to <hi>Isaac</hi> alone, &amp; partly in
confession of subjection, being now under covert-baron, the command
and protection of a husband. Well, I dare compare, yea prefer this vailed
wives chastity, before the virginity of many vailed votaries.</p>
                  <p>§ 18. More south is <hi>the river of Egypt</hi> the utmost limit, not onely of this
Tribe, but of all <hi>Israel.</hi> Indeed by <hi>the river of Egypt</hi>

in <hi>Exodus</hi>) onely <hi>Nilus</hi> is intended. But this stream (which
some conceive is particularly called <hi>Shichos</hi>) is termed the <hi>River of Egypt,</hi>
                     <pb n="234" facs="tcp:48509:132"/>
not because it is in, but is in the high way to <hi>Egypt.</hi> Otherwise, the travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
who sits down on the banks thereof, shall never come thither. In the
<hi>Septuagint, Rhinocolura</hi> is put for this river of <hi>Egypt,</hi> being a long named
city of short note, seated on the influxe thereof into the sea. Only this <hi>Rhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocolura</hi>
is famous in heathen History, because hither (as into an Hospi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall)
all those malefactors were sent, whose noses were cut off for their
offences: a punishment inflicted on the <hi>Egyptians</hi> by an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> King
who conquered them Hence had it the name of<note n="*" place="margin">Strabo Geog. lib. 16. p. 759.</note> 
                     <hi>Rhinocolura,</hi> or the place
of <hi>nose-maimed</hi> people. But ô how great must that city be which in our
age should contain all those, whose faces are nose-less, not by others cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty,
but their own luxury!</p>
                  <p>§ 19. As for other cities in this Tribe of <hi>Simeon</hi> they were many, but
obscure. It is observable that most of them are written with an <hi>Aliàs</hi>
first, as they are named <hi>Iosh.</hi> 19. secondly, as they are called <hi>1 Chron. 2.</hi>
None need to wonder at their different denominations. Here I interpose
nothing of the severall writing of the same places
<list>
                        <item>1 According to exact Criticks in spelling them.</item>
                        <item>2 According to vulgar tongues in pronouncing them.</item>
                     </list>
Onely we commend to the Readers notice, that the book of <hi>Chronicles</hi>
was written after the return from<note n="m" place="margin">1 Chr. 3. 19.</note> Captivity; and about eighteen gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
after the days of <hi>Ioshua.</hi> And therefore some difference of letters

name. And yet great places longest retain their names unaltered, (as
<hi>London</hi> from <hi>Taeitus</hi> to our times) whereas small cities like these in <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meon</hi>
are as often alterable, as passed into the possession of severall ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.

the main reason of the alteration was, because <hi>Iacob</hi> could not call his
son, but must recall his lost wife to his mind, so that his very name con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
carried a coffin in the mention thereof. Highly he was beloved
of his Father; and good reason; First, because begot in his old age. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
because the youngest: and affection, which always descends,
when it can goe no lower, settles it self. Thirdly, because he was mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.
Lastly, because brotherless, <hi>Ioseph</hi> being conceived dead, and so the
portion of affection due to him, fell to <hi>Benjamin</hi> as the right heir there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</p>

Strange, that strangers, being<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 50. 7.</note> the Elders of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court and
kingdome, should so affectionately bemoan the death of a man no whit
related unto them. Surely the <hi>Egyptians</hi> did not <hi>weep-Irish</hi> with faigned
and mercenary teares, much less was their passion onely State-sympathy
and politick compliance, sighing and smiling with the sighs and smi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
of <hi>Ioseph.</hi> Rather it was because the endearing disposition, and
obliging goodness of old <hi>Iacob,</hi> living fifteen years with them in <hi>Egypt,</hi>
had gained the generall love of the land. Besides, they lamented his
loss as the death of their own grand-father, because he was Father to
<hi>Ioseph,</hi> the Father, founder and preserver of them and theirs in the time
of famin. If any demand why the <hi>Egyptians</hi> mourned for <hi>Iacob</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">Gen. 50. 3.</note> three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score
and ten days, whilst <hi>Ioseph</hi> made a mourning for him but for<note n="c" place="margin">Gen. 50. 10.</note>
seven days? I can tell the common answer, that the former ignorant of
heavenly happiness lamented him totally lost, whilst <hi>Ioseph</hi> not<note n="d" place="margin">1 Thes. 4. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
without hope</hi> was more moderate in his lamentation. But whether
this solution be sound in it self, or the question exactly conformable to
the text, we remit it to the examination of others. I would rather know
the reason why this solemnity of sorrow, was performed in this place,
rather then at the cave of <hi>Machpelah</hi> forty miles hence, where the corps
were interred; surely the <hi>Master of the Ceremonies</hi> in those days could give
an account thereof.</p>
                  <p>§ 16. But here it will be objected, that <hi>Ioseph</hi> coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
had a nearer way by many miles to carry <hi>Iacobs</hi> corps to <hi>Hebron,</hi> then
by going over <hi>Iordan.</hi> It is confessed, but this fetching a compass was
conceived more for the state of the funerall. Unfitting it was, that the
body of that worthy Patriarch (to whom all the land belonged by
promise) should steale into that Countrey in a clandestine way, and
privately enter in at the postern door, rather let it solemnly surround the
Countrey, and be brought in at the broad gates. Thus the corps of
men of quality, though the Chancell-door be nearer, are borne
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48509:139"/>
through the porch and middle-alley to the place of their interment.</p>

the destruction of his Altar, which presently clave asunder,
according to his prediction? An Altar, which (were it of brass or

thereupon. Indeed he conceived, that his kingdome must have Idolatry
for the pillars, which had Rebellion for the foundation thereof: and
though <hi>Baalisme</hi> began and ended with the family of <hi>Ahab, Calfe-worship</hi>
was rivetted into the Crown of <hi>Israel.</hi> As for the Prophet that foretold
the future ruine of this place, a Lion<note n="s" place="margin">1 Kin. 13. 24.</note> slew him in his return, because he
credited a pretended <hi>Revelation Parole</hi> unto another man, before a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission

                     </note> a small City, but great
enough to give a check to the full speed of <hi>Israels</hi> victories. Their losse
here was inconsiderable<note n="h" place="margin">Iosh. 7. 5.</note> in it self (no more then thirty six men) but
dangerous in the consequence thereof. Such a flaw in their orient suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess,
made them cheap in the worlds valuation; and the <hi>Canaanites</hi>
(who hitherto had charactred them invincible in their apprehension)
began hence to collect, and conclude a possibility of conquering them.
Yet not valour too little, in such as fought, but sin too much in some
who staid at home, caused this defeat. <hi>Achan</hi> was the man, who in fine
proved no whit richer for the gold, or warmer for the garment he had
stolen. Detected by lot, accused by his conscience, convicted by his
own confession, condemned by <hi>Ioshua</hi> he (with his<note n="i" place="margin">Iosh. 7. 24.</note> children and cattle)
is stoned by the <hi>Israelites.</hi> The place of his execution was called, the <hi>vale
of Achor, or the vale of trouble,</hi> both because <hi>Achan</hi> actively had troubled
<hi>Israel</hi> with his sin, and because here he was justly troubled by them in
his punishment. As for the promise of the Prophet in after ages, that the

                     <hi>vale of Achor should be a door of hope,</hi> understand it mystically, that the
most deplorable, and seemingly desperate estate of the Church, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of comfort, and may in Gods due time be changed into a prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
condition. <hi>Achan</hi> thus punished, how active are the Armes of the
<hi>Israelites,</hi> when freed from the fetters of Sacriledge! <hi>Ai</hi> is quickly conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
the inhabitants thereof being trained by a dissembled flight of their
foes, into their own destruction. Now although such ambushes are
now adays unambushed, by the generall suspicion all have of them, yet
in the infancy of the world, when battells were meerly managed by
main might, and downright blowes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (men bringing all their forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove

Idolatry committed therein. Neer this place<note n="o" place="margin">1 Sam. 14. 23.</note> was the wood, wherein
when it rained honey from heaven, the <hi>Israelites</hi> being in pursuit of the
<hi>Philistines,</hi> wanted hands to receive it, having them bound up by <hi>Sauls</hi>
adjuration, not to eat before night. I see neither piety, nor policy, but
humour and headiness in <hi>Sauls</hi> resolution, the way to encrease their
<hi>stomach,</hi> and not their <hi>valour.</hi> Might not a cursory meal been allowed
them, in a running march, a snatch and away? Here <hi>Ionathans</hi> eyes were
opened with tasting a little honey, and presently his eyes were opened
again in a sadder sense, seeing himself liable to death for breaking his
Fathers command. Nor was it his own innocence, and <hi>invincible ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi>
of the law, but the peoples<note n="p" place="margin">1 Sam. 14. 45.</note> interposing, which preserved him

Now, as in the body of a man, if an inspection might be made into it
whilest he is alive, every nerve, and artery therein (then flushed up with

invisible, past discovering: so each small angle, and turning of <hi>Iudah's</hi>

adays (the land long since, being in a manner dead, and desolate) are

principally seated therein; and therefore to prevent scarcity
of victualls in so populous a place, the Court-purveyours
went further off, that the City might be better provided;
or, because <hi>Solomon</hi> did ease, and favour that Tribe, whence
he himself was extracted.</item>

to Scripture alone in our following description.</p>
                  <p>§ 2. We begin with the <hi>Brook of Kidron:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The brook <hi>Kidron.</hi>
                     </note> which we may call the <hi>Brook
of Reformation;</hi> for often the current thereof carried away the Reliques
of Idolatry; once when the Idol of his grandmother <hi>Maachah</hi> was by
King <hi>Asa</hi>

people (no doubt by his command) threw the Idolatrous Altars there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.
Thirdly, when the dust of the <hi>Altars</hi> erected by King <hi>Manasses,</hi> was
by <hi>Iosiah, cast into the channel of</hi>

                     <hi>Kidron.</hi> I dare boldly say that the water
of this brook, was no whit the less the sweet in taste, or clear in colour
for washing away these monuments of superstition. However this
<hi>Kidron</hi> may be ranked amongst those Rivolets whereof<note n="f" place="margin">Job 6. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>Iob</hi> speaks, <hi>My

not that the water onely slideth away, other succeeding in the room
thereof (which is common to the greatest channels) but this very <hi>Brook</hi>
it self slides away in the Summer and is dryed up, as having no fountain
to feed it, but the waters running down from <hi>Mount Olivet;</hi> Thus <hi>Kidron</hi>
is the too lively emblem of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

of goodness in themselves, flow no longer then they are watered from

                  <p>§ 3. This Brook runs through the <hi>Valley of Iehosaphat,</hi>

                     </note> being a hollow
dale interposed betwixt <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and <hi>Mount Olivet,</hi> but why so named I
finde no satisfactory reason alledged; for I cannot agree to what gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally

of the text, that battell appears fought far off in the wilderness of <hi>Tekoah.</hi>
Many are of opinion, that as <hi>Mount Olivet</hi> shall be the Tribunall, erected

all offenders at the last day shall be arraigned, founding their conceit
partly on the words of the Prophet<note n="h" place="margin">Ioel 3. 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <hi>Ioel, I will also gather all Nations, and
bring them down into the valley of Iehosaphat, and will plead with them there for my
people;</hi> partly on the expression of the Angels to the Disciples after <hi>Christs</hi>
ascension,<note n="i" place="margin">Act. 1. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>that in the same manner he should return again.</hi> But these are too

it being improbable he would appoint the certain particular
<hi>place,</hi> who in his wisdome hath caused the <hi>time</hi> to be concealed; yea
if one day be as a thousand years with God, why may not, according to
the same proportion, the whole earth be meant by the <hi>Valley of Iehosaphat?</hi>
Wherefore waving curious inquiries about the circumstances belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
onely to the Judge to assigne, let us carefully provide our selves for
those Assises, the proper work for us to performe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

have conveyed them to the <hi>Cave of Macpelah</hi> the solemn sepulcher of his
family. She was buried by the high way, the ancient custome both of
<hi>Iews,</hi> and Heathen, partly to minde passengers of their mortality, and
partly to preserve the memory of the dead the longer, by so making their
monument the more publick and visible. Heathen used in like manner
to interre their dead in high-ways: yea their sepulchers served to measure
the distances of places.

A tree which may pass for the emblem of prudence, slow in
consultation, swift in execution; for it putteth forth its leaves the last of
all trees, but then (as it is said) all in one night, as if sensible of, and
ashamed for its former neglect, she endevours to overtake other trees
with her double diligence. Men feed on the fruit, Silkworms on the
leaves thereof: Creatures contemptible in themselves, admirable in
their qualities, appearing <hi>Proteus</hi>-like in sundry shapes in the same year,
eggs, wormes, flies, finishing for the most part yearly their life and work
together. But we leave these mysteries to be discussed by Naturalists,
and will onely adde, that if the originall of silke were well considered,
Gallants had small cause to be proud of gay clothes, for from wormes
it came, and to wormes shall the wearers therof return.</p>

allured many (youth especially) to the reading thereof, the

Give me leave therefore my Lord, humbly to commend to
your Honour, the constant reading of that, which eminently
is termed <hi>The Scripture</hi> and the <hi>Bible</hi> or <hi>Book,</hi> all other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

contain what will make you <hi>wise unto salvation;</hi> and the
study thereof will render your Lordship more truely honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

honour done to your Ancestors by our English Kings, above

ornaments) out of their own <hi>Armes,</hi> therewith to deck and
adorn those of your <hi>family.</hi>

probably first founder thereof. Then it was but a small place,
(the greatest <hi>Giant</hi> had once the cradle of his infancy) when

                        <item>2 <hi>Iebus.</hi> A name either of the whole or principall part thereof; so
we read of the <hi>Levite</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="margin">Judg. 19. 10.</note> that he <hi>came over against Iebus, which is Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem.</hi>

<pb n="314" facs="tcp:48509:172"/>
changed into <hi>R,</hi> which notwithstanding the propriety of the

their own Tribe, so they) exchanged letters of the same Linage,
(same <hi>Instrument) Labials</hi> for <hi>Labials, Gutturals</hi> for <hi>Gutturals,</hi> whereas
betwixt <hi>Beth,</hi> &amp; <hi>Resh</hi> in Hebrew no such affinity. Besides the turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a tender melting <hi>B.</hi> into a surly rigid <hi>R.</hi> is not to levigate
or mollifie, but to make the name the harder in pronun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation.
This drives others to seek out the Etymology thereof,
as signifying in Hebrew, <hi>The vision of peace.</hi> But seeing <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>

                  <p>§ 2. Concerning the generall situation of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> three things here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
are remarkable: first it was placed, as<note n="p" place="margin">De bell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Iosephus</hi> reports, in the very mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
of <hi>Iudea.</hi> But herein criticall exactness is not to be observed, (the
heart it self is not so unpartially in the midst of the body, but that if not
in position, yet in motion it propends to the left side) for <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines
more to the south of the Countrey. As <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was the navell of
<hi>Iudea,</hi> so the Fathers make <hi>Iudea</hi> the middest of the world, whereunto
they bring (not to say, bow) those places of Scripture, <hi>Thou hast wrought
salvation in the midst of the earth.</hi> Indeed seeing the whole world is a <hi>round
Table,</hi> and the Gospell the <hi>food</hi> for mens souls, it was fitting that this
<hi>great dish</hi> should be set in the midst of the <hi>Board</hi> that all the guests round
about might equally reach unto it; and <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was the <hi>Center</hi> whence the
<hi>lines of salvation</hi> went out into all lands. Yea <hi>Ptolemy</hi> dividing the (then-known)
world into seven Climats, placed <hi>Ierusalem</hi> as the <hi>Sun,</hi> in the fourth
Climat, proportionably to what is said in the<note n="q" place="margin">Ezek. 5. 5.</note> Prophe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>§ 3. Secondly, it had high<note n="r" place="margin">

                     </note> mountains under it, and lower about it,
which as dutifull servants at distance seemed to attend it. <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had
a mountain for her footstool, and her floor was higher then the roof of
other Cities: no doubt the Emblem of the strength, stateliness, and
stability of Gods Church in glory. High and hard climbing thither, but
plain and pleasant dwelling there.</p>
                  <p>§ 4. Lastly, it was distanced from the sea welnigh forty miles, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
no navigable River near unto it. For God intended not <hi>Ierusalem</hi>
for a staple of trade, but for a <hi>ROYALL EXCHANGE OF RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIGION,</hi>

to the northern part of the City. Where, first, we finde the <hi>Corner-gate,</hi>
whose angular position speaks it to participate of two points, being seated

to wearing out: so (walls being the cloaths of Cities, without

and wall bending thereabout, should have most cost and care ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended

                  <p>§ 11. No mention of the repairing of this gate in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>

<list>
                        <item>1 Either that it was then dammed up. <hi>Ierusalem</hi> after the captivity
being large in extent, and thin in people, (many uninhabited
places being left therein) probably in policy they contracted
the number of their gates, the multiplying whereof did require
more money and men to guard them. Or<note n="c" place="margin">For this gate is mentioned Zech. 14. 10.</note> rather,</item>
                        <item>2 Being so lately built by <hi>Uzziah,</hi> it might notneed much mending,

                        </item>
                     </list>
For, in the sacking of a City it often fareth with the gates as with the
men thereof, it is hard if some doe not escape, and survive the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Yea, sometimes conquerours are pleased to spare some parcell of
walls, out of pity (not to the place but) to themselves, finding the
structure thereof of so firme constitution, that it requires more pains
then it will return profit in the levelling thereof.</p>

the stones of this tower fell not more heavy on their bodies, then the
censure of uncharitable <hi>Iews</hi> did on their memories, condemning them
for the greatest sinners in all <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> as whose offences were mounted
so high, that nothing less or lower then the fall of a tower, could depress
their Persons, and impieties to the pit of perdition. False position to
maintain, that those have wrought the most sin, who are brought to
most shame, and confuted by our Saviour, assuring the <hi>Iews,</hi> if they did
not repent, <hi>they should likewise perish: likewise; certitudine, non similitudine poenae.</hi>
Yea, in a mysticall meaning, those incredulous <hi>Iews</hi> who rejected our

his predecessours did, and he might justly receive. In this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect,
one may truly say, that each gate, tower, and piece of wall
in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was in part repaired with <hi>Nehemiah's</hi> money, because

his remitting unto them, the taxe due to him as Governour.</item>

a large proportion in the work. He kept a daily Ordinary (thanks

many attendants then dined on the reversion, at the waiters ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?

thereof.</p>

                        <item>2 The vast circuit of the City, put them to hard duty to guard it.</item>
                        <item>3 Trading was dead therein, and little wealth to be gotten at the

However in after ages, <hi>Ierusalem</hi> grew exceeding populous, and had all

<hi>He must run, before he could goe,</hi> for seeing <hi>the first commer was only served,</hi> he

                  <head>CHAP. VII. Of Davids Palace, the High-priests houses, the Coenaculum, and other
memorable places in mount Sion.</head>
                  <p>§ 1. WE begin with mount <hi>Sion,</hi> making that first which God
most favoured,<note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 87. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>who loved the Gates of Sion, more then all the
tabernacles of Iacob.</hi> Here first our eyes are entertained with the stately
Palace of <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">2 Sam. 5. 11. &amp; 1 Chr. 1 4. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Hiram</hi> King of <hi>Tyre</hi> sending him timber and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
for the building thereof. Flat was the roof of this palace, whereon
<hi>David</hi> sate, and from whence he beheld <hi>Bathsheba</hi> (hard by is her house)
bathing her self. I cannot excuse her action herein. If policy be jealous,
that hedges may have eares, modesty may suspect lest the motes in the
aire have eyes. But see here divine justice. As this roof was the place
whereon <hi>Davids</hi> lust did burn first; so thereon <hi>Absaloms</hi> incest did blaze
farthest, lying here with his Fathers Concubines. This he easily did at
the perswasion of <hi>Achitophel;</hi> those spurres needing no rowels, which are
to prick forward graceless youth into wantonness. But that hellish Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litician
did this to set such a distance betwixt Sire and Son, that the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of the one might never meet with the submission of the other,
the breach hereafter being made so deep and wide, that no bridge of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation
might be built betwixt them.</p>
                  <p>§ 2. Under the <hi>Romans</hi> this Palace was turned into a<note n="c" place="margin">Act. 21. 37.</note> Castle, where a
Garrison was kept to over-awe the City. Once the honour, now the
terrour; once the beauty, now the bridle of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> Upon<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 21. 40.</note> the fair
stairs leading thereto, stood Saint <hi>Paul</hi> when he made his speech to the
people, hearing him with great silence, because he spake <hi>in</hi>
                     <note n="e" place="margin">Act. 22. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>the Hebrew
tongue;</hi> untill he came to that passage of <hi>preaching to the Gentiles</hi> (which
though spoken in Hebrew was no good Hebrew to his auditours, but
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:48509:182"/>
false construction, &amp; breach of Jewish priviledg) when they turned their
attentive eares into railing tongues, <hi>away with such a fellow from off the earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 3. And now to shew the frailty of humane happiness, pass we from
the palace of these Kings to their burying place, seeing <hi>Sion</hi> in a double
respect may be called the <hi>Westminster</hi> of <hi>Ierusalem;</hi> because the Kings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
resided there while living, and rested when dead. The reader shall pay
nothing but his pains in following me, whilest I shew him these royall
remains. We may observe four gradations of honour in these interments.

cast into a wood, will finde out the way; thrown into a dungeon,

the Temples of the holy Ghost, the <hi>Iews</hi> justly began, and <hi>Christians</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendably
continue the custome of their solemn interment.</p>
                  <p>§ 6. Farther off from the palace, we finde <hi>the house of the mighty;</hi> where
<hi>Davids worthies</hi> lived in a Colledge under <hi>Ioab</hi> their President, next the
Kings<note n="w" place="margin">Zach. 14. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>wine-press</hi> and his<note n="x" place="margin">Neh. 7. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>fish-ponds.</hi> Think not that the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi>
had onely Crowns, Thrones, and Scepters, the Ensignes of Soveraignty,
for besides these to maintain their state, they had places of profit, so thrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
as to make their own wine at the best hand.</p>
                  <p>§ 7. Next we take notice of the houses of <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas</hi> both a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
<note n="y" place="margin">Joh. 8. 13. &amp; 24.</note> at once, and termed the high-Priests at the same time; one by
courtesie, because lately he had been: the other by right, because at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent
possessed of the high-Priesthood. Thus that function, which ought
to have been during life by Gods institution, was made alternately annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
by mans innovation. Was not the shining of two Suns together in the
Jewish Church sadly ominous? And was it not high time for God to take
away the office, when men began wantonly to play at <hi>in and out,</hi> with that
holy profession? But besides these two high-Priests, there was a third that
had more right then either to the place, our Saviour himself, at the present
brought a prisoner before them. In the house of <hi>Annas</hi> an officer wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<note n="z" place="margin">Joh. 18. 22.</note> struck him with the palme of his hand, and in the house of <hi>Caiaphas</hi>
he was thrice denyed by<note n="a" place="margin">Joh. 18. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>Peter,</hi> adjured by the high-Priest, adjudged to
death, spit upon, blinded, buffeted, with other insolencies offered unto
him. The houses of the high-Priests were far asunder, all which distance
Christ traced on foot; and it is observable, that being posted back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and forwards, from <hi>Annas</hi> to <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> from <hi>Caiaphas</hi> to <hi>Pilate,</hi>
from <hi>Pilate</hi> to <hi>Herod,</hi> from <hi>Herod</hi> to <hi>Pilate,</hi> from <hi>Gabbatha</hi> to <hi>Golgotha,</hi> he
traversed all the length and breadth, and most of the considerable places
in the City: Partly to render his passion more publick, <hi>being made a
spectacle to men and Angels,</hi> partly that his <hi>beautifull feet might bring the Gospell
of peace</hi> into every principall street in <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
                  </p>

Strange musick to be heard in the midst of a populous place; and very
pleasant, that such a woody retiredness should be afforded in the heart of a
City. Yet <hi>Solomons</hi> minde, when mounted on these seeming felicities, was
as far from reaching true contentment, as the tired traveller, when on the

Courts (wherein the greatest capacity thereof did consist:) whereas no

his grandchild <hi>Herod Antipas</hi> Tetrarch of <hi>Galilee</hi> kept his passeover, when

<hi>Herod</hi> take this for a sign that <hi>Christ</hi> was the <hi>Son of God,</hi> because he would
shew no sign for the will of man. However the silent shew of our

I question whether <hi>Herod</hi> who condemned him, slept half so
soundly. He must be smote before he could be waked, and his shackles
fell off easier then his sleep. The <hi>Rhemish</hi> note tells us, that the chains
wherewith he was bound are still preserved at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Church of
<hi>Petri ad vincula.</hi> But if those there be the true chains, I dare boldly say,

these Princely Palaces were not extant in this City at the same time, but

                  <head>CHAP. XII. The mysteries of mount Calvary.</head>
                  <p>§ 1. SUburbs in Cities are like <hi>Suckers</hi> in trees,<note place="margin">The dolorous way.</note> which make them
bigger, but not better; so that much of the strength of the City
leaks out in such Excresences. <hi>Ierusalem</hi> therefore had no suburbs at all,
but many pleasant mountains and gardens about it. We will begin
with mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> and the passage thereunto, commonly called <hi>the
dolorous way,</hi> (though thence came all our comfort) traced with the
blessed feet of our Saviour, <hi>who suffered without the gate.</hi> This we are now
to describe, and ô that our patience and practise might goe along with
our pen! to observe our Saviours motion, according to the counsell of
the Apostle,<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 13. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Let us goe forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing his
reproach.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 2. This <hi>dolorous way</hi> began at <hi>Gabbatha</hi> or the <hi>Pavement:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The wild justice of <hi>Pilate.</hi>
                     </note> wherein
we may take notice of a wild piece of justice in <hi>Pilate,</hi> first scourging,
then crucifying Christ. If his offence was but criminall to deserve
scourging, why was he crucified? If so capitall as to deserve crucifying,
why scourged? Perhaps <hi>Pilate</hi> hoped by his scourging to satisfie the
malice of the <hi>Iews,</hi> but in vain. For it was not the back-bloud, but the
heart-bloud of Christ must satisfie their thirst. So that what might be
pity in the intent of <hi>Pilate,</hi> proved cruelty in the event to Christ; whose
bitter cup hereby was twice filled. Thus we commit double-folded,
twisted, and complicated sins, which our Saviour expiated with dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
suffering, first scourged, then crucified.</p>
                  <p>§ 3. Hence being condemned he<note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 19. 16.</note> bare his own Cross part of the
way,<note place="margin">Reasons of Christs fain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting under the Cross.</note> towards the place of execution, according to the custome of male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factours
(and we know what <hi>Furcifer</hi> inports in the naturall significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
thereof) untill, it seems, at last he fainted under the burden thereof;
whereof severall reasons are assigned.
<list>
                        <item>1 Probably the <hi>Iews</hi> malice provided him a Cross of extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
greatness, proportionable to the reputed offendour Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount.</item>
                        <item>2 He was much debilitated with his long watching and sweating
the night before.</item>
                        <item>3 The edges of the Cross grating his late whip-furrowed back,
might occasion the new bleeding of his wounds, and his weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
thereby.</item>
                        <item>4 He bare withall the invisible weight of the sins of mankind, and
Gods anger for the same.</item>
                     </list>
Hereupon a substitute or surrogate was provided for him to bear his
Cross, not out of any mercy, but the deeper malice of his enemies; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:48509:187"/>
thereby to reprieve him to a more publick death; not willing he
should die under, to cover him from shame, but upon the Cross, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
him to the greater ignominy: partly, because they were loath he
should goe away so easily as in a fainting fit, and therefore their cruell
kindness reserved him for a more painfull death.</p>
                  <p>§ 4. <hi>Simon of Cyrene</hi> is the person by them compelled to bear his Cross.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> bearing Christs Cross.</note>
Had it been foretold that one <hi>Simon</hi> should have carried Christs Cross,
and had one heard <hi>Simon Peter</hi> so lately, so solemnly promising,<note n="c" place="margin">Mat. 26. 35.</note> 
                     <hi>though I
should die with thee, yet will I not deny thee,</hi> he would hence have certainly
concluded him the party for that service. But it fell out far otherwise;
whilest that <hi>Simon</hi> had forsaken his Master (and now was bewailing
his fault) another of that name is found out, coming out of the field,
to carry the Cross before him. Let Heraulds then boast of mens <hi>bearing,</hi>
and their <hi>blazing</hi> of armes, (empty huskes where the kernell of vertue is
wanting) behold here a rich bearing indeed; <hi>A Cross proper</hi> carried by
<hi>Simon</hi> for our Saviour. We must buckle our selves in like manner for
the same burden, patiently to undergoe afflictions. The best is, our
Crosses are made hollow, being greater in bulk then in burden; seeing
the Cross of our Crosses, eternall damnation, is taken off by the suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our Saviour.</p>
                  <p>§ 5. And now Christ comes to the place of execution,<note place="margin">Mount <hi>Calvary</hi> why so called.</note> called <hi>Golgotha</hi>
or mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> that is, <hi>a place of a skull.</hi> Either from the fashion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
because that hill was rounded up in the form of a mans head, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
mens bones were scattered thereabouts. <hi>Tremellius</hi> with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability

                     <hi>Gareb</hi> in <hi>Ieremy,</hi> being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed
<hi>to lie near the valley of the dead bodies.</hi> Here our blessed Saviour in a
publick place, with infamous company, (who lived amongst <hi>Publicanes,</hi>

In whose sufferings we may observe</p>
                  <p>§ 6. The <hi>length thereof,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The length of Christs passion.</note> lasting six tedious houres, exposed all that time

both being still<note n="e" place="margin">Joh. 19. 32.</note> alive when Christ expired: but they endured but per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall

what his Passion lacked in the length, it had in</p>
                  <p>§ 7. The <hi>breadth</hi> thereof:<note place="margin">The breadth thereof.</note> extended over all the parts and powers

the rapin and violence of our hands, the swiftness of our
feet in the way of wickedness, with the manifold sins, which
that sense in us committeth.</item>
                     </list>
What shall I speak of his <hi>head pierced with Thornes,</hi> so to make satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for the profane plots and projects, the wicked machinations of
our brains? And it is worth our observing, that though the <hi>Scarlet
Robe</hi> (put on him to act in that Princely Pageant) was taken from
him, (as of some value, no pain, and too good to be spoiled) yet the
<hi>Crown of Thornes,</hi> painfull to him, and profitable to no other, was, (for
ought we finde) continued on his head, all the time of his passion. In a
word, it is hard to say, whether his pain was more shamefull, or his
shame more painfull unto him: the exquisiteness of his bodily temper,
increasing the exquisiteness of his torment, and the ingenuity of his
Soul, adding to his sensibleness of the indignities, and affronts offered
unto him.</p>
                  <p>§ 8. Thirdly,<note place="margin">The depth thereof.</note> 
                     <hi>depth.</hi> His passion was as deep as Hell it self, induring
tortures in his wounded Conscience to the apprehension of a desertion;
witness his Exclamation, <hi>My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me!</hi> not
that really he was forsaken, or totally conceived so, shewing his faith in
the deepest of his distress. For as when twins in the womb of <hi>Tamar</hi>

the Primogeniture unto him that first put forth his hand, as a champion

wherin Faith and Fear did contest for the priority, Faith must be esteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the heir and eldest, first putting forth his hand, <hi>My God;</hi> yea both his
hands, <hi>My God, my God,</hi> claiming by that gemination a double interest in
Gods fatherly affection.</p>

building of the Temple.</head>
                  <p>§ 1. NOw <hi>Solomon</hi> his son being a peaceable Prince,<note place="margin">The Halcyon days of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
                     </note> as his name
imports, in his quiet reign began the building of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
Thus as Cryers make an <hi>Oyes</hi> to silence all noise, that
men may the better attend to the Judge when beginning his Charge; so
by a generall peace, <hi>the rage of all people was stilled,</hi> before God in the Oracle
did begin his familiar discourse with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> or the foundation of
the Temple taken in hand. Then <hi>Solomon</hi> enters on the work, employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in mount <hi>Lebanon,</hi> a vast army of workmen, in their severall distan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to advance this Fabrick.</p>
                  <p>§ 2. Namely,<note place="margin">The multitude of workmen.</note> for servile work, an<note n="a" place="margin">1 Kin. 5. 15. &amp; 2 Chr. 2. 18.</note> hundred and fifty thousand
bearers of burdens, and hewers of stone and wood. All these were
strangers, <hi>Solomon</hi> reserving his native subjects for their purses to pay
taxes, not persons to bear burdens. Secondly, for plain work; in which
thirty thousand <hi>Israelites</hi> were imployed, yet with such<note n="b" place="margin">1 King. 5. 14.</note> alternation, that,
divided in three parts, they stayed one moneth in mount <hi>Lebanon,</hi> and
the other two at home. Thirdly, for carved-works; herein the <hi>Sidonians</hi>
onely were used, whose exact number is not specified: But they must
needs be numerous, if we may guess the men by their mouthes, and
their mouthes by the<note n="c" place="margin">2 Chr 2. 10.</note> proportion of victualls allowed them. Lastly,
above all for direction three thousand three hundred were appointed
(surely so many officers would suffer no drones to be in the whole
hive) to oversee the rest.</p>
                  <p>§ 3. Such,<note place="margin">Two invincible gulfes to swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low mens la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</note> who admire how so many could so long be busied in
such a building, would haply have wondred more, how so few in so
short a time could have finished the same, had they beheld the magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficence
thereof. Two great gulfes there were, which insensibly swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
up the labours of many thousands of men. First, the want of
horses in <hi>Iudea</hi> (plenty whereof were brought out of <hi>Egypt</hi> towards the
latter end of King <hi>Solomons</hi> reign) whereupon massie timber in those
mountainous countreys, were managed by the main strength of men.
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:48509:195"/>
The second was a religious Criticisme peculiar to this structure, all
things being beforehand so framed and fitted in mount <hi>Lebanon,</hi> that
<hi>not so much as the sound of an Axe, or Hammer was heard in Ierusalem, when it
came to be erected.</hi> Which exactness must needs occasion many charge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
essayes and samples, before it could be attained. Nor wanted there
a mystery therein, because as the moving Tabernacle typified the <hi>Church
Militant;</hi> so the Temple resembled the <hi>Triumphant,</hi> where those who
shall be thought worthy to be admitted into glory, shall have nothing
to doe, but to be admitted into glory.</p>
                  <p>§ 4. Some will say with<note n="d" place="margin">Ioh. 3. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Nicodemus,<note place="margin">Objection a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possibility thereof.</note> How could these things be,</hi> that no
noise should be made at the erecting thereof? suppose but a bedstead
having head, sides, feet, posts, tester, cords, and curtains fitted before, it
cannot be set up without some necessary noise. Yea grant their ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers
or mallets cased with some soft matter, to bribe them to silence,
yet they could not be made so mute, but that the very contusion and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement
of the aire, would unavoidably advance some sound. Nor
were the beams of the Temple so far in love with their mortises, as to
run into them, or the mortises so fond of the beams, as to embrace them
of their own accord.</p>

will account it improbable in it self, and unproportionable to Scripture.
Others distinguish on the degrees of the noise; small in comparison of
so great a work, and not obstreperous to a publick disturbance. But the
best interpret it, that no laborious sound was heard from the hewing or
squaring of timber, or stone, but onely a more cheerfull, yea melodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
harmony, from the happy conjunction, and compacting of parts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
now easily matched, which had been contracted before. This I am
sure, that what tongue-tied tools soever, were used at the erecting of the
Temple, too clamorous instruments were imployed at the destruction
therof, <hi>when they brake down the<note n="e" place="margin">Psal. 74. 6.</note> curved work thereof at once with axes and hammers.</hi>

<hi>Solomon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> would not burden himself with superfluous numbers, yet in this
Fabrick, wherein he did personate and represent the great God of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
he consulted more with his magnificence, then his frugality, not
minding so much how many the building in bare necessity did require,
but how many the builders with full authority could command.</p>
                  <p>§ 7. Notwithstanding so many labourers entertained in the work,<note place="margin">Seven years spent in buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</note>
seven years was this Temple in building. Here some will behold the
sanctity and perfection of the <hi>septenary number,</hi>
                     <note n="f" place="margin">1 King. 6. 38.</note> so often occuring in
Scripture, whilest we conceive this the best reason, why just seven years
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:48509:196"/>
were spent in the building thereof, because it could not be ended in six,
nor accomplished within a shorter compass of time. Indeed almost
twice as much time (thirteen years) did <hi>Solomon</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 King. 7. 1.</note> spend in building his
own house: whereof this fair and ingenuous reason is rendered by
<note n="h" place="margin">Ant. Iud. li. 8. cap. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Iosephus; because he was not so intent and earnest therein, as in the structure of
the Temple.</hi> It is in another case reported to the praise of <hi>Boaz,</hi>

                     <hi>the man
will not be at rest, untill he have finished the thing;</hi> so <hi>Solomon,</hi> during those seven
years of the Temples building, did not sleep in a cessation from, nor
slumber in an interruption of that work, which was intended for the
honour of God. Though in erecting his own Palace, as he made it for
his pleasure, so he did it at his leasure; as conveniencies would permit.</p>

clearly within the house, besides the breadth of the wal without) yet some
wil say it answered not expectation, and the stately character given therof

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:48509:197"/>
principally consist not so much in the greatness, as exquisite symmetry
thereof, and costly furniture therein. 2. It was abundantly big enough
for the use for which it was intended, namely to contain the holy ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sells
(with sufficient, yea with large space betwixt them) and to receive
such Priests as did officiate therein. For the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> was accessible
to the high-Priest alone, and that but once a year, and into the <hi>Holy</hi> or <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
house</hi> came not all the many thousands of <hi>Levites,</hi> but onely such
Priests (to light lampes, set shew-bread, offer incense) as by <hi>Lot</hi> and
<hi>course</hi> were called thereunto, as appeareth by <hi>Zacharies</hi> sole staying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,

                     <hi>multitude of the people were praying without.</hi> Indeed no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of drudgery was done in the Temple, or what must require many
men to manage it, it being neither handsome nor healthfull to croud
much company into a covered room in that hot Countrey. Lastly, the
great latitude and capacity of the Temple consisted in the outward
Courts, unseparable parts thereof of such receipt, as to entertain multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of men <hi>sub dio,</hi> in the open aire, as compleating a square of five
hundred cubits, and in the amplitude, largeness and magnificence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
equalling, yea exceeding the greatest buildings in the world, if report
be but reduced to the standard of truth, and travellers not permitted to
<hi>slip their thumb</hi> in their measuring of yards, overlashing in their relations.</p>

covered part thereof. It was more then twice as great as the Tabernacle
made by <hi>Moses,</hi> which (as<note n="k" place="margin">De templi fabrica. l. 1. c. 7.</note>

<hi>Exod.</hi> 26.) was but thirty Cubits in length, ten in breadth, and as
many in height. Yea, well might the Temple exceed the Tabernacle in
dimensions, if we consider; First, the <hi>Tabernacle</hi> was erected by exiles
wandering in a barren wilderness; the <hi>Temple</hi> by a potent Prince, and
his populous subjects in their own peaceable countrey. Secondly, the
<hi>Tabernacle</hi> was in a manner fitted for its foundation, to the backs and
shoulders of the <hi>Levites,</hi> which were to carry it, and therefore might
not exceed a portable proportion. Thirdly, the <hi>Temple</hi> mystically ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified
the Church Triumphant, and therefore in strength, state, grace,

heaven, must peruse, and compare all expresses dispatched thence. Yea, in

                     <hi>what purpose was this wast?</hi>
seeing the inside thereof was but an useless vacuity, not having any bells
therein (trumpets being the onely bells of the Hebrews to summon
their assemblies) and that otherwise it was for no service. But know,
that is not empty, which is full of ornament; nor idle, which stands
both for strength, and state. If an elegant <hi>exordium</hi> be so usefull in an
oration, to gain the ears of the Auditors; no less gracefull a fair front
in a building, to win the eyes of the beholders. Nor was <hi>Solomon</hi> minded
like many in after-ages, who cut down all top-masts from the ship of
Christs Church (politickly pretending a tempest, and that all is done
for her safety) and make her close notted to the very keel; but, his large
hart and hand, cared not what he expended on the magnificence of Gods
House.</p>

and cary on the aforesaid height, of an hundred and twenty Cubits
(appropriated in the text to the porch alone) even to the whole fabrick
of the Temple, making the entire body thereof of an uniform height,
equall with the porch. Where, to excuse them from inconveniences,
they make the lower Temple to reach to the first loft, roof, or seeling of
Cedar, over which they fancy an upper house of equall propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the roof whereof ranged even with the porch in height; so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
a <hi>Duplicate,</hi> or all the rooms of the Temple to be double, one on
the floor, the other in the upper story. Indeed we read in <hi>Solomons</hi> song
of a sort of sheep<note n="f" place="margin">Cant. 4. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>whereof every one bare twins,</hi> but that such gemination
was here in the Temple, is altogether improbable, Scripture being silent
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:48509:198"/>
of that second, or upper story, nor mentioning any use, for which it
was intended, and confining the height of the Temple to just thirty
<note n="g" place="margin">1 King 6. 2.</note> Cubits. Well therefore may we suspect some flaw, or crack in those
spectacles, which represent the Temple thus double, against the simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city

next in position to the porch) rather to reach over in their relation, to
other more inward parts of the Temple, conceiving it too vast and
needless an expence, to overlay a tower six score Cubits high within
with gold. But, ill fare <hi>covetous Commentatours</hi> on a <hi>liberall text.
Solomon</hi> will give them small thanks for their great thrift; to spare his
cost, and at once to spoile both the letter of the text, and the lustre of his
Temple. We conclude it overlaid with pure gold, that is, gilded all over,
but being silver within; so reconciling it to another place, where <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>
is said to have provided<note n="l" place="margin">1 Chr. 29. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay
the walls of the houses withall.</hi> Thus it took the denomination of gold, from
that metall which was most precious, and most visible on the surface
thereof.</p>
                  <p>§ 6. Let none here condemn me, for grudging the Temple her glory,
thus debasing the gold thereof into silver-gilt. For mine own part, as
<hi>Moses</hi> wished <hi>all Gods people<note n="m" place="margin">Num. 11. 29.</note> Prophets;</hi> it would not offend me, if all
Gods House were <hi>pearles,</hi> mine eyes are not so bleared with envy, as to
smart at the shining of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple. But a due decorum must be
observed in this edifice, and one place of Scripture must not be advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
to depress another. And, seeing there were degrees in holiness,
why not also gradations in gallantry, between the severall rooms of the
Temple? So that all three might be overlaid with <hi>pure gold;</hi> the <hi>porch</hi>
with leafe, the <hi>inward house</hi> with plate, the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> with the most
refined gold of <hi>Parvaim.</hi>

that these windows, made as much to let in aire, as light, and (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance)
more to let out smoak then either (caused by the constant lamps
and perfumes) were open without any shutting at all, I see no coercive
argument, to enforce his beliefe to the contrary, can be taken out of
Scripture. Now because the Temple was compassed about with three
stories of chambers, each of them, five, and all three, fifteen Cubits high,
these windows in the Temple must be made above the roof of those
chambers, where their high standing afforded a double benefit, both of
clearer light, and greater privacy.</p>

of the extraordinary softness, and pliableness thereof? It is answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
either they were rivetted into holes fore-prepared of purpose, or
else they were stifned with some mixture of silver, or copper, not for
cheapness, but the greater usefulness thereof. Be it here once for all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that, where the Utensils of the Temple, are termed of pure gold,
understand it so pure, as the end, for which they were intended, would
permit. Otherwise some necessary allay of baser metall made them not
onely serviceable for, but more durable in that purpose, for which they
were imployed.</p>

that vaile of like<note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 26. 31.</note> workmanship, which <hi>Moses</hi> had made by Gods di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,
then put himself to the pain, and expence of a new one? Let
them know, that the former vaile fitted for the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum</hi> in the
Tabernacle, was too short and narrow, yea, half in half too little for this
purpose. Therefore, it not being princely to piece, patch, or eek the
same, another was contrived, as indeed nothing at the second hand was
suitable to so stately a fabrick, wherein (as the Apostle in another case)

onely a pure Hebraism, &amp; that <hi>in the midst</hi> signifieth the same with <hi>within,</hi>

                  <p>§ 3. It is not expressed in Scripture,<note place="margin">The vessels of the Tabernacle kept in these chambers.</note> for what use these chambers were
principally intended. Some conceive them designed for galleries, or
walking-places; which to me seems too much presumption, for any to
take their pleasure so near the holy place. Others will have them used
for Dormitories, for such Priests to lodge in, who were in ordinary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
about the Temple. For my own part, I conceive them imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for Repositories, wherein the holy vestments, and vessels were safely
laid up, together with those of the Tabernacle, which (though not used)
were here carefully preserved. For, first, the vessels of <hi>Moses</hi> his making
were not aliened, or diverted to any profane service; such sacriledge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unsupposable in that age. Secondly, they were not altered, or melted
by <hi>Solomon</hi> (of moe and lesser, so to make fewer, and greater Utensils for
the Temple) because, the making, as well as the matter; the shape, as
well as the substance of all the Tabernacle-vessels were of <hi>livine institution.</hi>
Thirdly, they were not imployed in Gods service, because (some few
excepted, whereof hereafter) being calculated for the <hi>Meridian</hi> of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle
a less fabrick, thus fel out to be too short, and smal in proportion
to the Temple, as in the Vail was formerly observed. Seeing therfore they
were neither aliened, altered, nor used, it remaineth they were carefully
kept in these chambers, intimated in the text,<note n="q" place="margin">2 Chr. 5. 5.</note> where after the finishing
of the Temple, the <hi>Levites</hi> are said to bring up into it, <hi>all the vessels of the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle.</hi>
Thus graces acquired or infused into a Christian in this life, are
not lost, forfeited, or cast away after death; but, preserved<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> perfected, and

In a word, for matter of numbers, fancy is never at a loss, like a
begger never out of his way, but hath some haunts where to repose it
self. But, such as in expounding of Scripture reap more then God did
sow there, never eat what they reap thence, because such grainless huskes,
when seriously threshed out, vanish all into chaffe.</p>

                     <hi>the covered Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi>
come we now to the Ring wherein it was
set, the Courts which encompassed it. Herein
we meet with much difficulty, arising partly
from Gods silence, (speaking little in Scripture of
the present subject) partly from mansloquacity,
whose fancies without warrant from the word,
are as copious as different in describing the Courts of this Temple. But,
that which makes the matter in hand more intricate is, because learned
men confound <hi>Temples</hi> and <hi>Times,</hi> ascribing those Courts to <hi>Solomons,</hi>
which onely belonged to the second Temple, at, and after the time of
our Saviour. Thus, as countrey painters make the <hi>nine Worthies</hi> (not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the garb of those ancient ages wherein they lived) with bands
and cuffs according to our modern fashion; so some Jewish writers
<hi>(Iosephus</hi> himself being not wholly free from this fault) shape the Courts
of <hi>Solomons</hi> Temple, not after their true form in the old Testament; but
as the second Temple adorned by <hi>Herod,</hi> stood modelled in their own
days.</p>

from the flocks of <hi>Laban</hi> his father-in-law, so sufficiently to distinguish
their severall stocks from making quarrels by meeting together. A
greater distance divides the two Temples, there being no less then seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
years, betwixt the destruction of the one, and erection of the other.
Enough in probability to prevent all mistakes, which might arise from

Priests,</hi> he is said to have made <hi>the great Court, and doors for the Court, and
overlaid the doors of them with brass.</hi> This Court in Hebrew is called <hi>Aza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah</hi>

there answered his peoples prayer by his <hi>gracious assistance</hi> afforded unto
them.</p>
                  <p>§ 2. Well might this be termed the <hi>great Court,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Certainly large, how large un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain.</note> seeing large (though

the least. But what was this to contain all <hi>Israel</hi> therein? <hi>Philip</hi> speaking

                     <hi>hundred penny worth of bread</hi> (saith he) <hi>is
not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little.</hi> But, grant this Court two
hundred Cubits square (more then the place will allow) this would
afford but few inches for a mans body to stand in, except the ground
was here (as the loaves) miraculously multiplyed. We therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
that the people of the land were successively admitted to this place,
otherwise impossible to contain them. Ascents, or staires did also lead
into this Court, but how many is not known; surely they were low
and little, short and easie, to be climbed up, otherwise the cattell brought
thither to be sacrificed, could not conveniently clamber over them.</p>
                  <p>§ 3. This Court was by successive Kings (especially <hi>Hezekiah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">This Court bettered by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Kings.</note> who

had in the days of <hi>Solomon.</hi> Some will say, this was a disparagement to

therein, to be amended by others. Were not his structures, as his disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,

                     <hi>Who is he that will come after the King in things?</hi> It
is answered, the outward Temple was, in the appendent Courts thereof,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:48509:206"/>
capable of more cost and expence, to make them both bigger, and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver;
though the covered Temple was <hi>semel &amp; semper, at once and for ever
perfected,</hi> afterwards admitting of no new addition, when <hi>Solomon</hi> had

to ingross all honour to himself, so that no reserve was left for posterity,
no bottome for their bounty to build on, in after ages, to testifie their
gratitude to Gods goodness. Some accessions therefore might be made
(though not to the vitall parts, as I may say) to the out-lims of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
It is the priviledge not of the house of God, but of God himself,

him to overlay those pillars with silver, which <hi>Solomons</hi> wisdome, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing

that he swerveth not at all from the proportion of the Copy, who onely
gilds, or colours the letters therein. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> for the main kept himself
to the former fabrick, not altering, but adorning the same. The worst
was, that afterwards he<note n="q" place="margin">2 King. 18. 16.</note> cut off the silver again to purchase the favour
of <hi>Sennacherib.</hi> Better had those pillars been left naked, then thus to be
clothed, and then to be stript of their costly coats. For, though (as some
scornfully may scoff) there was no danger of their catching cold when
thus disrobed; yet the beauty of those pillars were thereby much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
looking ruggedly when again uncased, besides the inexcusable
sacriledge therein committed, whereof hereafter.</p>

Kings Palace, through which the Kings of <hi>Iudah</hi> had at pleasure a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

and Piety; as also that Princes (besides their set, solemn, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
addresses to God by prayer) must have their secret recourses unto
him, in their occasionall devotions. It was first made by King <hi>Solomon,</hi>

of his Palace to the Temple, and utterly renouncing all relation to true

                     <hi>Parbar</hi> seated on the west must not be

a gate therein, because two porters daily attended it. Say not, it was
suspicious, that so small a Court would run out at so many gates, which
surely were no more, then just proportion, and uniformity did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
                  <p>§ 2. The principall office of Porters was to secure the gates,<note place="margin">The number and office of the Porters.</note> provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for the peace and purity of the Temple and service therein. These
in all were<note n="m" place="margin">1 Chr. 23. 5.</note> four thousand, thus daily disposed of; Eastward, six; North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
four; Southward, four; at <hi>Asuppim-gate,</hi> two; and two, West<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
at the Causway, four; at <hi>Parbar-gate,</hi> two; four and twenty in
all. An eminent number in Temple-service (so many the singers<note n="n" place="margin">1 Chr. 25. 32.</note>, and
the severall<note n="o" place="margin">1 Chr. 24. 18.</note> courses of the Priests) to which the four and twenty Elders
in the<note n="p" place="margin">Revel. 4. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Revelation</hi> have some allusion. Their service was, as well
nocturnall, as by day:<note n="q" place="margin">Psal. 134. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>which by night stand in the house of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 3. Here let others dispute,<note place="margin">A treble quere concerning the Porters places.</note> whether the Porters places were meerly
ministeriall, (or servile rather) or also partly judiciall, with some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missive,
and exclusive power to take cognizance of the cleanness of
such persons as did approach to the Temple. Otherwise, they were
easily qualified for their office, rather bigness then brains commending
men generally to such imployments. Secondly, if they were intrusted
with any such authority, let others enquire, by what means they made
discoveries of peoples uncleanness, finding no oath <hi>Ex officio</hi> they ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
to any to betray themselves, though otherwise some secret polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
might be concealed, the parties themselves being onely privy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
Lastly, let them discuss, whether these Porters were afterward
advanced to higher places, or onely (as the doors whereon they atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
turned round on their hinges) moved alternately in their own
sphere, without possibility of any farther preferment. If the latter, it is
strange that the worthy parts of <hi>Zachariah his son Porter Northward,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
in Scripture to be a<note n="r" place="margin">1 Chr. 26. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>wise counsellour,</hi> should be imprisoned in so
narrow a profession. And yet his employment (though the meanest
about the Temple) was honourable in it self, if well executed: witness
holy <hi>David</hi> his choice, <hi>I had rather be<note n="s" place="margin">Psal. 84. 10.</note> a door-keeper in the house of my God, then
to dwell in the tabernacles of wickedness.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 4. Now notwithstanding all the care of the Porters to the contrary;
some (not going through the gates,<note place="margin">Intruders into the Temple without the Porters leave.</note> but over the walls) made bold to
lodge and live with their whole families within the verge of the
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:48509:207"/>
Temple. <hi>Yea, the sparrow<note n="t" place="margin">Psal. 84. 3.</note> hath found an house, and the swallow a nest for her self,
where she may lay her young, even thine Altars, O Lord of hosts, my King, and my
God.</hi> By Altars understand the Courts and buildings about it, otherwise
the Altar it self (fitter for Salamanders then Sparrows) was too hot a
climate for their habitation. Birds, we see, may prescribe an ancient
title to build in our steeples, having time out of minde taken the same
priviledge in the Tabernacle, and Temple. Yea <hi>David</hi> in exile debarred
access to Gods publick service, doth pity his own, and prefer the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
of these fowls before him. And, although no devotion (whereof
they were uncapable) but the bare delight in fair fabricks, brought them
hither; yet, we may presume (according to their kind) they served
God better then many men in that place, chirping forth Morning and
Even-praises to the honour of their maker. To take our farewell of these
Porters, wicked <hi>Ahaz</hi> gave them a <hi>Supersedeas.</hi> from their office, in that
long <hi>Vacation</hi> wherein he<note n="u" place="margin">2 Chr. 28. 24.</note> shut up the doors of the house of the Lord,
so obstructing Gods mercy against himself.</p>

other parts, untill the people every day bringing earth thither, at last made it plain and
large enough.</hi> Insomuch that the Temple extant in the days of <hi>Iosephus<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> had
a threefold wall about it, and other courts built on that forced ground,
which industry had added thereunto. See here the small compass of the
Temples floor at the first founding thereof. So that those who in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
time make moe Courts about it, must build them in the aire, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the earth (such then the scantness and steepness thereof) afforded
no bottome for the building of such imaginary fabricks.</p>
                  <p>§ 2. But shrewd objections<note place="margin">Object.</note> are brought to the contrary,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>David</hi> at least prescribed three Courts.</note> by such who,

                     <hi>all the Courts of the house of the Lord, which he meant to make.</hi>
These therefore at the least must needs be three, seeing <hi>All</hi> (as<note n="g" place="margin">Lib. 1. de Caelo. cap. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Aristotle</hi>
observes) can not in proper language, be predicated of a lower number.</p>
                  <p>§ 3. Answ. I confess the words so read in the vulgar Latine, <hi>&amp; omnium
quae cogitaverat atriorum,</hi> though no such thing appears in our translation
founded on the originall, where <hi>David</hi> is said to deliver to <hi>Solomon</hi> the

                     <hi>pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, of the house of the Lord, of all the chambers

west of the Temple,<note place="margin">Court on the west.</note> or else (which is altogether improbable) the <hi>Holy
of Holies</hi> lay open, unfenced, and common to the City.</p>
                  <p>§ 5. Answ. The same was sufficiently fenced, and severed from the
City with the precipice of the place, barring all access, and the Temple
on that side surrounded with ambient aire in the concavity of the vally.
If besides this, any artificiall wall encompassed the Temple on the west,
the distance between it and the Temple may be counted a passage, but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted

sexes in severall Courts in the <hi>first Temple</hi> hath no foundation in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,

However it may be that there was anciently a partition of the <hi>outward

he was no eye-witness of the first and old Temple (being born five
hundred years and more, after the dissolution thereof) and onely spake
of it, either by tradition, or conjecture, and therefore his authority of no
such strength, as to command our beliefe. Besides, he seems to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
what formerly we cited out of him, for the narrowness of the
place, not admitting moe Courts in <hi>Solomons</hi> time. However, his eyes
were so dazeled with long looking on the second Temple extant in his
age, that he conformeth thereto, and confoundeth therewith <hi>Solomons</hi>
Temple, if making any moe Courts then two therein.</p>

death of <hi>Solomon,</hi> might by succeeding Kings, have another Court added
thereunto; namely, when by art, industry, and great expense they had
raised up the valley, and gained more ground to <hi>the mountain of the house,</hi>
which was so small at the first. Hereof we finde a double insinuation
in Scripture:

                        <item>1 One, when <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> is said to stand <hi>in the house of the Lord before

Wherefore, as the sons of <hi>Barzillai,</hi> though Priests, yet because they found
not their genealogy reckoned in the<note n="r" place="margin">Ezra 2. 62.</note> Register, were therefore removed
from the priesthood, till one with <hi>Urim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> should arise to

essentiall parts of the world, did afterwards furnish them

eares to hear, and hearts to understand it.</p>
                  <p>§ 2. We begin with the Porch,<note place="margin">The different dimensions of the Pillars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conclled.</note> where the two great brazen pillars
were set up, each of them<note n="b" place="margin">1 King. 7. 15.</note> twelve Cubits in compass, (bearing a little
more then four Cubits in Diameter) four<note n="c" place="margin">Ier. 52. 21.</note> fingers thick of solid me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall,
and the rest hollow within, some difference appearing in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of their height, variously presented unto us;
<q>
                        <bibl>1 KING. 7. 15.</bibl> 
                        <p>And he cast two Pillars of brass of eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen

                     <q>
                        <bibl>2 CHRON. 3. 15.</bibl> 
                        <p>Also he made before the house two Pillars
of thirty and five Cubits high.</p>
                     </q>
                     <list>
                        <item>1 To reconcile these, some have recourse to severall Cubits, <hi>common,</hi>
or <hi>great; of the first measure</hi> conceiving the former mentioned in
<hi>Kings;</hi> the latter (which were twice as big) intended in <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>2 Others understand the bare shaft of the Pillars to be eighteen
Cubits high, besides the Chapiters above, and Basis beneath
them: the former being<note n="d" place="margin">1 King. 7. 16.</note> five Cubits, and the latter so many as
made the totall number thirty and five.</item>

height of both Pillars are counted together.</item>
                     </list>
Where if any object, that eighteen and egihteen Cubits make thirty six,
one more then the number in <hi>Chronicles; Ribera</hi> conceives that so much
onely as appeared of these pillars are summed up, each of them having
half a Cub it of their shaft lost in their height, as running in, and hid in
his Chapiter grafted upon it.</p>

§ 3. The chapiters of these pillars were curiously adorned with <hi>net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work,
<note place="margin">Their chapiters how adorned.</note> chain-work,</hi> and <hi>rowes of pomegranats.</hi> These were but apples of brass,
whilest <hi>words spoken in due season</hi> are far more precious, being like those <hi>of
gold in pictures<note n="f" place="margin">Prov. 25. 11.</note> of silver.</hi> Lillies<note n="g" place="margin">1 King. 1. 19.</note> also were made on the top of these Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piters,
wherein though <hi>Hiram</hi> might imitate the fashion of those
flowers, no art could counterfeit their colours, seeing he who set him on
work, even<note n="h" place="margin">Luk. 12. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>Solomon himself in all his glory was not arayed like one of these.</hi>
These pillars set in the porch did not like those two in <hi>Dagons</hi>

support the main fabrick thereof, nor was any burden born by them,
but were onely (like brazen Andirons in great mens chimnies) for
ornament. Let none say unto them as the master to the men in the
market place,<note n="k" place="margin">Mat. 20. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Why stand yee here all the day idle?</hi> seeing they were usefull in
their kind, and contributed much to the beauty of the Temple.</p>
                  <p>§ 4. Others will say, these pillars were ill placed, because obscured
in the porch, where few did behold them. His kindred said to our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<note n="l" place="margin">Iohn 7. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>There is no man that doth any thing in secret, and he himself seek<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

openly.</hi> Had <hi>Solomon</hi> for his credit intended to make the Temple appear glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
he should not so privately have concealed these pillars in the Porch.
<q>—Occultae non gratia magna columnae.</q>
Better had they been set like the <hi>Colossus</hi> at <hi>Rhodes,</hi> or the two Columns
before Saint <hi>Markes</hi> in <hi>Venice, sub dio,</hi> in the open aire. But here we must
know, first, that <hi>Solomon</hi> intended his Temple, not so much to be seen, as
to be glorious. Secondly, the door leading into the Porch, being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
broad, and high, these pillars were not wholly concealed, but a
great part, if not all of them, was exposed to publick view through the
door of the Porch.</p>
                  <p>§ 5. The Pillar<note place="margin">The meaning of the Pillars names.</note> standing on the right hand in the<note n="m" place="margin">1 Kin. 7. 21.</note> Porch was called
<hi>Iachin,</hi> that is, <hi>he will stablish;</hi> and the other on the left side <hi>Boaz,</hi> that is,
<hi>in him is strength.</hi> Pity without power will be but lame to help us;
Power without pity will be but deaf to hear us; whilest both together
make a comfortable composition. Both these pillars we finde in a
manner erected in the expression of the leper<note n="n" place="margin">Mat. 8. z.</note> to our Saviour:
<q>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Iachin,</hi> but doubtfully and conditionally, <hi>Lord if thou wilt.</hi>
                        </l>
                        <l>
                           <hi>Boaz,</hi> positively and absolutely, <hi>Thou canst make me clean.</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
Both these pillars there set up, signified Gods protection of the place, and
<hi>the gates of hell</hi> could not prevail against that Temple, which had these
pillars in the Porch thereof.</p>

and the light therein enables us, the better to behold all
the rest. The Tabernacle had but<note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 37. 17.</note> one, the Temple ten<note n="b" place="margin">1 King. 7. 49.</note> Candlesticks
of pure gold, (this exceeding that <hi>ten to one</hi> in lustre) <hi>five on the right side,
and five on the left,</hi> each of them no doubt fashioned like that which <hi>Moses</hi>
made, seven fold with a great shaft for the body in the midst, and three
stems on each side branching out thereof. In some resemblance of the
seven <hi>Planets,</hi> amongst which the <hi>Sun,</hi> the stock of light, stands in the
midst, and three other on each side, above, and beneath it. Here we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but minde the reader of a foul mistake in<note n="c" place="margin">Anti. lib. 8. c. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Iosephus,</hi> who beholding
these Candlesticks through a multiplying glass, in stead of <hi>ten</hi> reads <hi>ten
thousand</hi> that <hi>Solomon</hi> made in his Temple. Yet we deny not, that besides
these ten standing Candlesticks of gold, there were many moe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oveable
ones, but all those made of<note n="d" place="margin">1 Chr. 28. 15.</note> silver, which the Priests in the night might
carry about with them. By these Candlesticks also, having lights always
in them, Gods Ministers in generall were represented. For, to say, that by
these seven lamps in the ten Candlesticks (threescore and ten in all) the
<note n="e" place="margin">Luk. 10. 1.</note> seventy Disciples were designed, would savour of too much curiosity.</p>
                  <p>§ 2. Next we take notice of the <hi>Table of<note n="f" place="margin">1 King. 7. 48.</note> shew-bread,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Table of Shew-bread.</note> which <hi>Solomon</hi>
made of that gold, which his Father <hi>David</hi> had peculiarly prepared for
that<note n="g" place="margin">1 Chr. 28. 16.</note> purpose. The particular dimensions, and fashion thereof,
is not mentioned in Scripture. Probably of the, like form with
that which <hi>Moses</hi> made in the Tabernacle, though of a far greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion.
On this loaves were daily presented to God; Who, not out of
any necessity (<hi>If I be hungry, I will not tell thee, for the<note n="h" place="margin">Psal. 50. 12.</note> world is mine, and the
fulness thereof</hi>) but free will, was pleased to accept thereof: otherwise no
more needing this <hi>bread</hi> to <hi>feed,</hi> then the <hi>light of the lampes</hi> to <hi>guide</hi> him. The
bread on this Table was tendered to God, partly as a <hi>Quit-rent,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession
that the <hi>Iews held</hi> all their food from his providence; and partly
as a <hi>Type of Christ, The<note n="i" place="margin">Ioh. 6. 41.</note> bread which came down from heaven.</hi> And, as <hi>serving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi>
feed on the reversions which their <hi>Masters</hi> leave, so the Priests
(when new was substituted in the room of the formet) eate those loaves
which were taken away. Not pretending with<note n="k" place="margin">Hist. Bel. v. 7.</note>

made by <hi>Moses</hi> in the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> two<note n="l" place="margin">Exod. 30. 2.</note> cubits high, and four square:
namely, with a cubit in the length, and another in the breadth thereof.
Proportionable enough for that purpose, no sacrifices of bulk being to be
offered thereon, but onely sweet odours (much whereof might lie in
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:48509:211"/>
little space) and <hi>spirituall spices</hi> (as I may term them) which took up but

                     <hi>refined gold</hi> for this Altar
of incense. And no doubt, <hi>Solomon,</hi> the Executour of his Will, performed it
accordingly. For, when it is said, that he<note n="n" place="margin">1 King. 6. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>covered the Altar with Cedar,</hi> and

<hi>Solomon</hi> made the <hi>Holy</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi> far larger then that in the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi>
and when every implement therein (to make the furniture proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable

then he cased the old <hi>Altar of incense</hi> with Cedar, and overlaid the
same with gold, to be but the <hi>Basis</hi> and <hi>Pedestall</hi> of a greater Altar, which
for the same purpose he advanced thereupon.</p>
                  <p>§ 4. As for the position of this <hi>Altar,</hi> that it was not set in the <hi>Oracle</hi>

                  <head>CHAP. IX. Of the vessels in the Priests Court.</head>
                  <p>§ 1. SO much for the Utensils in the covered Temple.<note place="margin">One onely Altar.</note> Proceed we
now into the Priests Court, and there first finde the brazen <hi>Altar,</hi>
having twenty<note n="a" place="margin">2 Chr. 4. 1.</note> cubits in length, as much in breadth, and ten in the
height thereof. Now, although <hi>Solomon</hi> made ten <hi>candlesticks,</hi> ten <hi>lavers,</hi>
ten &amp;c. yet he confined himself to one <hi>Altar of incense,</hi> one <hi>Altar of sacrifice,</hi>
(multiplying of <hi>Altars</hi> hearing ill in Scripture, as suspicious of Idolatry)
but whether therein pointing at Christ our <hi>onely Mediatour,</hi> or at the unity
of the Church, let others dispute.</p>
                  <p>§ 2. Now seriously considering this <hi>Altar,</hi> we meet with many
wonders therein. First, that being set <hi>sub dio,</hi> in the open aire, it is
strange that rain (presumed sometimes to fall in great plenty, with
great violence) did not extinguish the fire thereof. Secondly, seeing
continuall fire was kept there, it is wonder, that the whole Court (as the
Chimney-generall thereof) was not turned <hi>Tawny-More,</hi> if not <hi>Black-More</hi>
with the constant soot, smuttiness, and smoking thereof. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
it is strange, that in so short time, so many sacrifices could be
consumed, within the compass of so small a place; especially at the
dedication of the Temple, when,<note n="b" place="margin">1 King. 8. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>sacrificing Sheep and Oxen that
could not be told, nor numbred for multitude.</hi> Lastly, it is admirable, that
in a Climate so hot, and place so populous, no putrefaction did arise
from the bloud, fat, offall, and ordure of so many beasts slain there,
to the infecting of the Priests, and people thereabouts. We know
how noisome, and offensive slaughter-houses in Sommer, are in
great Cities; insomuch that <hi>Tertio Richardi secundi</hi> a motion was made,

or some such distant place from the walls of the City.</p>
                  <p>§ 3. But under favour I conceive,<note place="margin">Unwondred if the nature of the fire be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</note> the true satisfying of these dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties
depends on the right understanding of the nature, or rather
the supernaturall qualities of the fire on the Altar. It was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
or culinary fire, but such as<note n="d" place="margin">2 Chr. 7. 1.</note> came down from heaven: which
(amongst other peculiar properties where with it was endowed) was
so far from being quenched by rain, or water, that it would quickly
lick it up, though<note n="e" place="margin">1 King 18. 38.</note> a <hi>trench,</hi> containing <hi>twelve barrels,</hi> were filled there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with:
as in the sacrifice of <hi>Elijah</hi> (fetching fire from the same originall)
it came to pass. Secondly, such celestiall flame, being of a more clarified,
and refined substance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> left not any suffocating smoke, or sooty feculency
behind it. Thirdly, being sent from heaven not to dally, but dispatch the
work (God employs no slugs on his errands) it made speedy riddance of
the matter in hand, and consumed the sacrifice of a sudden. We know
how quickly <hi>lightning</hi> (though not the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

the Altar) will turn any thing that resists it, into ashes. Hereupon,
some conceive, that by <hi>Ariel,</hi> that is, <hi>Gods Lion,</hi> in the<note n="f" place="margin">Isa. 29. 1.</note> Prophet,
the <hi>Altar in the Temple</hi> is meant. A voracious Lion indeed, which
with <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> lean kine, devoured many thousands of cattell, and was
no whit the fatter for the same. Lastly, such heavenly fire was a great
preservative against infection, and the purgative nature thereof, swept
away much putrefaction, which otherwise would have proved very
noisome.</p>
                  <p>§ 4. Pass we now from the <hi>fire,</hi> to the <hi>Water:</hi> from the <hi>Altar,</hi> to the <hi>Molten
sea.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The brazen Sea.</note> A worthy vessell this was, of solid brass; five cubits high, and ten
over from side to side, <hi>being</hi>

his thirst, out of the <hi>jawbone of an Ass.</hi> And it seems, the <hi>Ghost</hi> of this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
did <hi>walk</hi> in the brains of the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> when first they invented this
tradition. But, this <hi>Etam,</hi> being full forty miles from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was
likely to afford them little water, for the replenishing of this <hi>Molten sea.</hi>
Rather we beleeve, that the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> or <hi>Nethinims,</hi> whose office it was
to be<note n="m" place="margin">Icsh. 9. 27.</note> drawers of water for the Congregation, out of the fountain of
<hi>Siloam,</hi> or <hi>Pool of Bethesda</hi> hard by, filled this <hi>Sea,</hi> and furnished
all other Lavatories, and Offices about the Temple, with that necessary
element. Yea, probably there were some wells within the verge of the
Temple, seeing <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is charactred by <hi>Strabo,</hi> an Heathen writer, to

wanted the conveniency thereof. And, which is the main, in <hi>Ezekiels</hi>
description of the Temple, which one may term <hi>A visionarie varnish on an

finde, the waters<note n="n" place="margin">Ezek. 47. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward,</hi> which
swelled to a miraculous proportion. Now, though the increase, and
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:48509:213"/>
overflowing of such streams, was extraordinary, and propheticall; yet
surely the fountain thereof was reall, and naturall, importing some
springs in the Temple, whence the <hi>Nethinims</hi> did fill this <hi>Molten sea,</hi> and
all other vessels with water, designed for the Priests to<note n="o" place="margin">2 Chr. 4. 6.</note> wash themselves
therein.</p>

But, we must know, it stood without shelter, high on a mount,

(gray hairs are multiplyed on men, more by afflictions, then old age)

forward fifteen degrees. Some conceive this Dial, not drawn on
the outside of any wall, or house, but contrived within a winding
stair-case, so that every step thereof bare proportion to the distance
of an houre: but whether this fancy may be reconciled to art, be
it referred to the judicious in dialling. However it was made, we
shall scarce meet with a Dial more ancient in any authour, which
many years after retained the name of <hi>Ahaz</hi> the erectour thereof.
But for all this Dial, <hi>Ahaz</hi> was one of those who could not <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern

§ 7. Now besides the originall Utensils of the Temple,<note place="margin">Two eminent supplies of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly instruments.</note> of the
same foundation with the Temple it self, there were severall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits
(not of different, but the same fashion with the former)
which succeeding Kings made in stead of those instruments, which
constant use and age had empaired. For, we must not think, that
the Ash-pans, Fire-pans, Snuffers, Caldrons, and Flesh-hooks of
the Temple, were like the bush appearing to<note n="p" place="margin">Exod. 3. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>Moses,</hi> always
burning, yet never consumed: or, that the knives used about the
sacrifices, were like the<note n="q" place="margin">Deut. 29. 5.</note> clothes of the children of <hi>Israel</hi> in the
wilderness, never a whit the worse for wearing, but they did
daily decay, and were duly repaired, especially in the reign of King

                     <hi>Iehoash.</hi> Thus when the soul of a Christian is by faith made the

and Ornaments.</head>
                  <p>§ 1. THe first Temple of God at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi>

<hi>to fall<note n="u" place="margin">Luk. 10. 30.</note> amongst theeves,</hi> or rather for theeves to fall into it.
Twice was it pillaged by forein foes, and four times by her own friends
before the finall destruction thereof. First, when <hi>Shishak</hi> King of <hi>Egypt</hi>
in the reign of <hi>Rehoboam, took<note n="w" place="margin">1 Kin. 14. 26.</note> away the treasures of the house of the Lord,</hi>
This wound, whence so much precious wealth did bleed forth, first
shewed, the Temple with the riches therein to be mortall. <hi>Shishak</hi>
did then but brush the house of God, whilest he swept the house of
the King, whence <hi>he even took away</hi>
                     <note n="x" place="margin">Ibidem.</note> 
                     <hi>all.</hi> Afterwards <hi>Ioash</hi> King of <hi>Israel</hi>
in the reign of King <hi>Amaziah,</hi> having stormed <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> took<note n="y" place="margin">2 Chr. 25. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>All the
gold and silver, and the vessels that were found in the house of God with Obed-Edom,
and returned to Samaria. That were found,</hi> for, such no doubt was the
providence of the Priests to conceal some wealth from his sight. A
thing not impossible for them to doe, having formerly hid a young
King, and his nurse six<note n="z" place="margin">2 Chr. 22. 12.</note> years invisible, from the jealous eyes of <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah.</hi>
                     <pb n="402" facs="tcp:48509:218"/>
And now, seeing idolatrous <hi>Ioash</hi> carried away this holy treasure
to <hi>Samaria,</hi> let none hereafter conclude the best cause from the best
success, finding the Cherubims of <hi>Solomons</hi> setting up, worsted by the

                  <p>§ 2. By the way, it is very remarkable, that the Tabernacle,<note place="margin">The Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle never plu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>red, and why?</note> which
lasted four hundred and thirty years before the Temple was begun,
was never plundered, or robbed, or spoiled of its goods. Yet the <hi>Iews</hi>
in that age were as sinfull, and their enemies as spightfull, <hi>Moabites, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dianites,
Ammonites, &amp;c.</hi> who in the interim betwixt the Judges, oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the people of <hi>Israel,</hi> though we finde none of them offering any af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front,
or violence to the Utensils of the Tabernacle. As for the <hi>Philistims,</hi>
though they took the Ark by conquest in the field, we know they were
forced with a witness to bring it back again. Whereas the Temple within
less space was by forein Princes often pilled and polled of the ornaments
belonging thereunto. Enquiring into the reason hereof, we meet with
none more probable, then because Divine providence delighteth in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting
what is weakest in it self. And seeing the Tabernacle was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
undefensible, and able to make no resistance, consisting onely of thin
boards, slight skins, &amp; slender curtains, God more immediately walled it
about with an awefull respect, which the very enemies thereof bare unto
it. Whereas the Temple, being a strong structure of stone, in a stronger
City, with walls, gates, and bars, visibly intitled it self to fortification,
and therefore God left it to the arme of flesh to defend it, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
failed therein, as nothing can be safe, which hath onely <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

frequently spoiling the wealth thereof, insomuch, that in all desperate

In vain doth <hi>what may be</hi> dispute, when <hi>what must be</hi> sits Doctour
of the Chaire. It is not onely lawfull, but needfull, to shave the haire,
thereby to save the head. The parting with the fruit, kept the tree alive;
otherwise, if not pacified with such a present, the idolatrous enemies
would undoubtedly have demolished the Temple, and totally rooted
out Gods service therein.</p>
                  <p>§ 5. But what ever politick palliations may be pleaded for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,<note place="margin">Such argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts answered.</note>
such sacriledge was unavouchable in it self, and those pretended
extremities to justifie it, were onely created; either by mens infidelity,
not beleeving Gods power; or their impatience, not atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
Gods pleasure, to defend his own glory, in his own due time,
by his own means. Yea, Heaven by the finall success protested against
such proceedings, and the treasure taken out of the Temple, and given to
Pagans, rather presently declined, then finally diverted the imminent
danger. Thus <hi>Ahaz<note n="f" place="margin">2 Chr. 28. 21.</note> took away a portion out of the house of the Lord, and gave
it to the King of Assyria, but he helped him not.</hi> Likewise when<note n="g" place="margin">2 King. 18. 15, 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Hezekiah</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented
<hi>Sennacherib</hi> with the wealth of the Temple to buy his favour, his
bribes proved ineffectull, who having received the present, was not
pleased to understand the language thereof, but nevertheless in the next
<note n="h" place="margin">Ibid. ver. 17.</note> verse invaded <hi>Iudah.</hi> As for the instance of <hi>Asa,</hi> God directly by the
mouth of his Prophet reproved him for his fact, in relying rather on the
King of <hi>Syria,</hi> then divine assistance. In a word, though some were
good men that did it, they were no whit the better for the doing it.
For, though it be Christian policy, and Christs<note n="i" place="margin">Luk. 16. 9.</note> precept, <hi>that men make to
themselves friends of the Mammon of unrighteousness;</hi> yet, goods rightly conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
to the righteous God, come not under that appellation: and such
holy things are unjustly <hi>degraded,</hi> which having once been advanced
to the dignity of a <hi>free-will-offering</hi> to God, are afterward set back, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a <hi>peace-offering</hi> to man.</p>
                  <p>§ 6. Indeed some hold,<note place="margin">No sacriledge, say some, under the Gospell.</note> that under the Gospell the sin of sacriledge
cannot be committed. If so, it is either because nothing under the
Gospell hath been given to Gods service; or, because God hath solemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
disclaimed the acceptance of any such donations; which, when and
where it was done, will be hardly produced. If this their position be true,
we have cause, first, to rejoyce in regard that God and his members are
now adays growen so rich, that they need not addition of humane gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuities
to be bestowed upon them. Secondly, we may congratulate the
felicity of ours above former ages, being not in a capacity of committing
the sin of sacriledge, to which those were subject, who lived before the
time of our Saviour. Lastly, we may silently smile, to see how Satan is

men now adays being secured from this sin, and put past a possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to be guilty thereof. But, before we goe thus far, let us first be sure,
we goe on a good ground, otherwise it is the highest sacriledge, to steal
away sacriledge it self, and to deny that (which formerly was a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous)
in our days to be any transgression.</p>

magnificence of the other in their memories.</p>
                  <p>§ 2. But here we meet with (almost) an inextricable difficulty.<note place="margin">Objection to the contrary.</note>
For, notwithstanding the premises so plain to the contrary, the dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions
of <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Temple appear larger then those of <hi>Solomons,</hi> if the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing

Behold here, how <hi>Cyrus</hi> his Temple was <hi>thirty Cubits</hi> higher (just as

although the length of this second Temple is not expressed, yet an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

thereof must needs be much greater, to manage such a breadth in any

of <hi>Manasses</hi> and <hi>Ammon,</hi> instituted any such yearly solemnity in

not onely a suspension, and interdiction of the Temple from pious uses,
but a totall alienation thereof from piety, and diversion to profaneness:

and by <hi>Maccabeus</hi> the old Altar was not (as by <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> and <hi>Iosiah</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to Gods service, but a<note n="s" place="margin">Ibid. ver. 47.</note> new one erected (hence perchance the

better to preserve Gods favours in the memories of others.</p>
                  <p>§ 8. Just (no doubt) were the considerations moving <hi>Maccabeus</hi> to
make this annuall festivall,<note place="margin">Christ at this Feast of Dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</note> seeing our Saviour in the Gospell<note n="t" place="margin">Ioh. 10. 22.</note> graced

Scripture, that Christ went up purposely to <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for the observation
thereof (as he did to the Passeover, which was of divine appointment)
but there might be a casuall coincidence of this feast, and his presence at

weakness beneath, and no more in one place, then another. And

the beams were not broken with the sudden subsidency of the

                        <item>2 Such a sinking fabrick would have frighted the Priests from offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating

was just twenty cubits high. If so, then by the sinking of this
fabrick, it was wholly swallowed in the earth, turned into a cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,

were<note n="i" place="margin">Act. 2. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>devout men,</hi> blindly pious (like Saint <hi>Paul</hi> before his conversion)
but desirous of information; zeal not being to be wrought, but
regulated, not to be new gotten, but right guided in them. Last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and chiefly, the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> invisibly wrought on their souls. Thus

We have insisted the longer on Saint <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon, because it is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of Ecclesiasticall History after Christs ascension, which, in Gods
due time, we are in some hope to finish by his assistance. And that the
foresaid Sermon was made in the Temple, appears by the passage of
their<note n="s" place="margin">Act. 2. 46.</note>

the question is,<note place="margin">Seated on the east side.</note> on which side thereof <hi>Solomons Porch</hi> was placed. Here
we had been utterly at a loss, but for the seasonable help of<note n="c" place="margin">Lib. Anti. 20. cap. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Iosephus;
The people</hi> (saith he) <hi>perswaded the King [Agrippa</hi> the younger] <hi>to repair the
east Porch or Cloister: Now this Cloister was of the outward Temple, standing
over an exceeding deep valley, raised upon a wall of four hundred cubits, which was
made of square white stones of twenty cubits long, and six cubits high a piece, the
work of King Solomon, who first built the Temple.</hi> Whereby it appears, that
this Porch respected the east, and was on each side of the entrance into
the Temple.</p>

§ 10. But the greatest difficulty remains.<note place="margin">Quest. Why called <hi>Solomons</hi> porch?</note> How came it to be called

his souldiers, the floor whereof had formerly felt no other feet, but those
of the high Priests, and those but once a year. Here he saw mysterious
ornaments, understanding (not the meaning but) the matter thereof to
be pure gold; a shroud bait to tempt his hungry souldiers to sacriledge,
besides two thousand talents of silver in the treasury of the Temple. On
all which he onely feasted his, and his officers eies, whilest their hands
did fast, not diminishing the least mite thereof, in veneration of that deity
to whom they did belong; Onely he took on him to restore <hi>Hircanus</hi> to
be high Priest, a presage that the Jewish Priesthood would shortly fall
down, which already did so shake, that the high Priest needed to take a

covet ousness of <hi>Crassus,</hi> and like a break-fast did inable him to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a dinner with a greater appetite; so that, notwithstanding his oath
to the contrary, he added sacriledge to his perjury. But seeing theeves give
whatever they take not away, we have rather cause to comend his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
that the golden table, candlesticks, and other ornaments escaped his
fingers; except, they were either hid from him by the carefull providence
of others, or left by him out of his own politick covetousnes, like nest-egs
to encourage others again to lay up more wealth in the same place. And
no doubt he hoped, though now he had mowed down the Temples trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
to the bare roots, shortly, when grown up again, to return to the

whilest he that <hi>swore by the<note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 23. 16.</note> gold of the Temple,</hi> was bound up and
concluded in conscience to the performance of his oath. Whereas our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
demonstrateth, that <hi>the Temple was greater then the gold,</hi> as the
<hi>sanctifier</hi> thereof. Besides, in common sense, he should seem faster tyed,
whose faith by oath was staked down to the Temple, as to a fixt, firme,
stable structure, then he whose truth was tyed onely to the gold thereof,
a more fading, flitting, moveable matter, as appears by <hi>Crassus</hi> and others
carying so much of it away with him into forein countreys. But indeed
(as our Saviour teacheth) the main obliging power of those oaths, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted
in the presence of God, before whom they were made, who alone
is immoveable and immutable, whereas in process of time, the Temple

               <p>Now, my <hi>Lord,</hi> upon a review of this your pedegree, I will
not be so Pedantick to minde you of a Grammar-instance,
to make it true construction in your Honours practise, <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norum

I request you to<note n="g" place="margin">Isa. 51. 1.</note> 
                  <hi>Look to the rock whence you are

               <p>To conclude then with <hi>Theophilus,</hi> with whom I began.
It is observable of him, that though styled <hi>most excellent</hi> by
Saint <hi>Luke</hi> in his Gospell, yet in the <hi>Book</hi> of the Acts (which

                  <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi>
without any honourable addition. What? Had Saint
<hi>Luke</hi> in process of time less civility, or <hi>Theophilus</hi> (with
more age) less Nobility? Surely neither, but Saint <hi>Luke</hi>
may be presumed, purposely to wave his titles, out of compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to the temper of <hi>Theophilus,</hi> who in his reduced age

grew weary of worldly pompe, more pleased to have the truth

Thus, the longer your Lordship shall live, the less you will

§ 2. For the present we are to describe mount <hi>Libanus</hi> or <hi>Lebanon</hi>
with the parts of <hi>Syria</hi> confining thereunto. A mountain which some
will have so named from Frankincense, (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in Greek) whereof
great plenty groweth there. Yet seeing it is usuall for Parents to give
names to their children, not children to their Parents, more probable
it is that Frankincense is called <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> from this mountain, breeding
store thereof, then that the mountain should be named <hi>Libanus</hi> from
Frankincense growing therein.</p>
                  <p>§ 3. But whilst humane writers are best pleased with this Greek
extraction of <hi>Libanus,</hi> more conformable to Scripture is the Hebrew
Etymology thereof from <hi>Whiteness:</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">In Hebrew White.</note> because the faithfull snow forsakes
not the top of this mountain (no not when persecuted by the Sun in the
dog-days) but remains there all the year long. A pleasant sight, at the
same time to have Winter on the top, and Sommer at the bottome of
one and the same mountain. Excellent the use of this snow in these hot
climats the Prophet<note n="b" place="margin">Ier. 18. 14.</note> mentioning it, as most welcome and precious,
<hi>Will a man leave the snow in Lebanon,</hi> wherewith the <hi>Tyrians</hi> and neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nations used to allay and mixe their wines: so making the Torrid
and Frozen <hi>Zone</hi> to meet in the Temperate, more healthfull for their
Constitutions.</p>
                  <p>§ 4. <hi>Lebanon</hi> was a place so pleasant, that an Epicure therein might feed
all his senses to a surfeit.</p>

spread hides on the ground,<note n="f" place="margin">De alimentis facult. lib. 3. cap. 38.</note> and from the boughs of trees shook

                     <pb n="3" facs="tcp:48509:241"/>
No wonder then that <hi>Moses</hi> made it his earnest request to take this
place in his way, to heaven: I<note n="g" place="margin">Deut. 3. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>pray thee let me goe over and see the good land,

conveniently might <hi>take his rise</hi> from the top thereof to eternall blisse,
and be the better provided to entertain endless happiness, when first he
had sipt some drops of the same in delightfull <hi>Lebanon,</hi> the temporall type
thereof.</p>
                  <p>§ 5. It will perchance be objected against the fertility of this place,
that the Prophet<note n="h" place="margin">Isa. 29. 17.</note> foretelleth, <hi>Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be
turned into a fruitfull field?</hi> Where its future conversion into fruitfulness
seemingly implies the present barrenness thereof. But here we must
distinguish betwixt <hi>field</hi> and <hi>forest</hi> fruitfulness. The former is compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
of the concurrence of art and industry with nature; the latter onely
takes what nature tenders, without any toile to improve the same,
wherein <hi>Libanus</hi> already did exceed. But now the Prophet foretells (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
this wild and native) an elaborate and artificiall fertility likely to
befall this mountain, namely in the speedy and universall alteration of
things in <hi>Israel,</hi> when champian fields for fear should be forsaken, and
husbandmen for their security retire with their tillage to mount <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banon.</hi>
Thus much for this fair and fruitfull place full of goodly trees,
wild and tame beasts in abundance; and yet when measured by an
infinite majesty,<note n="i" place="margin">Isa. 40. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Lebanon is not sufficient for him to burn, nor all the beasts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
of sufficient for a burnt offering.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 6. Having largely praised this place (enough to set all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
Princes at variance about the propriety thereof) it is
now high time to inquire to whom the right thereof did belong. Here
we finde an undoubted evidence, that the same by a double title per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined
to the land and people of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1 As a fence to the vineyard. 2 As a Common to a City.
As a fence to a vineyard. So the Prophet in his Parable<note n="k" place="margin">Is<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>And be
fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof.</hi> Now although this fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
principally refers to Gods protection over the <hi>Iews,</hi> yet is it not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appliable
to the naturall posture of their countrey, hem'd in with mount
<hi>Libanus</hi> on the north. Secondly, if we conceive all <hi>Iudea</hi> under the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

LEBANON towards the Sunrising.</hi> And though probably the neighbouring
Tribes <hi>Asher, Naphtali,</hi> and <hi>Dan</hi> did reap the most benefit thereby, yet all
the rest are presumed to have a right both in the herbage for their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,

                  <p>§ 7. Forget we not that humane writers make a division of the
mountain, calling the northern ledge thereof <hi>Libanus,</hi> the southern <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Libanus</hi>
whereas the Scriptures taking no notice of this distinction, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press
both under the generall name of <hi>Libanus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 8. And now to climbe this mountain, behold it every where scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
with <hi>Solomons</hi> workmen, some bearing of burdens, (Better to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

pieces for the tower of <hi>Babel</hi>) some hewing of stones, all busied,
either with their hands as labourers, or eyes as overseers. No hole left
for idleness to peep in at, but presently she was perceived and punished.
I hope without offence, one may wish them <hi>God speed,</hi> the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<note n="n" place="margin">Psal. 74. 6, 7.</note> he <hi>that hewed timber afore out of the thick trees, was known to bring it to
an excellent work, but now they break down all the work thereof with axes and
hammers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 9. It is now high time that leaving the generall description of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus</hi>
we come to survay the severall places on, or near thereunto. In the
southwest side thereof near <hi>Zidon,</hi> and the sea, lay the land of <hi>Cabul,</hi>
which <hi>Solomon</hi> gave to <hi>Hiram King of Tyre</hi> for the cost and charge he was
at in building the Temple. Hereby it appears that this territory (though
lying in<note n="o" place="margin">1 King. 9. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Galilee</hi> was no part of the <hi>Land of Canaan,</hi> it being above the
power of the Kings of <hi>Israel,</hi> to alienate any parcell thereof. But though
it was unlawfull <hi>to take the childrens bread, and cast it unto dogs,</hi> yet the crust
and parings thereof might be given them: to which this Land of <hi>Cabul</hi>
may well be compared, being so course and base a Countrey, that it little
contented King <hi>Hiram,</hi> who therefore called it<note n="p" place="margin">1 King. 9. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>Cabul,</hi> that is <hi>dirty,</hi> or <hi>displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing.</hi>
It may seem strange that <hi>Solomon,</hi> who in other things consulted
with his honour and magnificence and <hi>to whom God gave a large heart,</hi>
should herein have so narrow a hand, as not to give <hi>Hiram</hi> a friend and
forein Prince full consideration, who so freely had furnished him
with all necessaries for his building. But
<list>
                        <item>1 Haply <hi>Solomon</hi> beheld <hi>Hiram</hi> as a Homager unto him, holding
the kingdome of <hi>Tyre</hi> from the Crown of <hi>Israel.</hi> And if so, then
all he did was but his duty, and fully rewarded in <hi>Solomons</hi> favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
acceptance thereof.</item>
                        <item>2 <hi>Solomon</hi> might conceive <hi>Hirams</hi> expences sufficiently satisfied in
allowing his men such a vast<note n="q" place="margin">1 King. 5. 11. 2 Chron. 2. 10.</note> proportion of yearly provision:
so these cities were given him not in compensation of the charge,
but as an overplus and meer gratuity. For which <hi>Hiram</hi> ought
to be thankfull because so good, not displeased because no better.</item>
                        <item>
                           <pb n="5" facs="tcp:48509:242"/>
3 Most probable it is, that absolute need, and no other reason,
made <hi>Solomon</hi> fall short, in satisfying <hi>Hirams</hi> expectation. His
treasure being much exhausted (excess will begger wealth it self)
by his sumptuous structures. The same necessitous principles,
which caused his intolerable taxes on his own people, might
also make him (against his own will, and generous disposition)
faile in rewarding the full deserts of <hi>Hiram.</hi>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is some contentment unto us, that though we know not the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
names, yet the<note n="r" place="margin">1 King. 9. 11.</note> Scripture acquaints us with the exact number of the
cities in <hi>Cabul-land:</hi> being twenty in all, as in our Map, we have recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
them accordingly.</p>
                  <p>§ 10. But here some will be very much startled, that this land of
<hi>Cabul</hi> should so lately receive this denomination from <hi>Hirams</hi> displea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
whereas we finde it so called four hundred years before in the book
of <hi>Ioshua,</hi> where the borders of the Tribe of <hi>Asher,</hi> are thus assigned:
they <hi>goe out to<note n="s" place="margin">Iosh. 19. 27.</note> Cabul on the left hand.</hi> To satisfie which seeming difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
we must know, that though the book of <hi>Ioshua</hi> contains matter of
far more ancient date,<note n="t" place="margin">Josh. 10. 13.</note> yet it was written by <hi>holy-men of God</hi> after the days
of <hi>David,</hi> and probably in the reign of <hi>Solomon.</hi> This appears because in
<hi>Ioshua</hi> mention is made of the book of <hi>Iasher,</hi> wherein the standing still
of the Sun and Moon was recorded, and that book of <hi>Iasher</hi> was pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
after <hi>Davids</hi> reign, because therein <hi>Davids</hi>
                     <note n="u" place="margin">2 Sam. 1. 18.</note> acts were also Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicled.</p>
                  <p>§ 11. Mount <hi>Libanus</hi> is overspread with the<note n="a" place="margin">1 King. 9. 19. &amp; 2 Chr. 8. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>buildings of Solomon,</hi>
whereof some may be conceived the fragments made out of the Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
and Reversions of the stone and timber left of what was provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
for the Temple. Yea probably some were platformes and modells
to heighten and improve the skill and knowledge of his builders. True
it is, in the making of the Tabernacle, every <hi>Tenon, board, hook</hi> and <hi>socket</hi>
were <hi>Iure Divino,</hi> both by precept and precedent, according to the<note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 8. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
in the Mount:</hi> but it was not so in the building of the Temple. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
God gave <hi>Solomon</hi> a <hi>large heart,</hi> and furnished him with <hi>Hiram</hi> a
skilfull workman: but as for all particular proportions, they were left
at large for their wisdomes to contrive. It may therefore with much
likelyhood be conceived, that to better their knowledge in Architecture
for the Temple some slight buildings in <hi>Libanon</hi> were erected, which
afterwards might serve <hi>Solomon</hi> for privacy, and pleasure, retirement, and
recreation. And seeing <hi>Solomon</hi> took his naturall history <hi>from the Cedar
that growes in Lebanon, to the Moss on the wall,</hi> haply he might study in some
of these buildings, where <hi>Cedars,</hi> and other simples were presented unto
him, being best able to comment on Natures works when he saw the
text before his eyes. Of these buildings in <hi>Libanus</hi> that tower <hi>which<note n="c" place="margin">Cant. 7. 4.</note>
looks towards Damascus</hi> was the principal, to which the Nose of the Spouse
in the <hi>Canticles</hi> is compared, for the whiteness, uniformity, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:48509:243"/>
largeness thereof, whereby the generousness and animosity
of the Church is intimated. The<note n="d" place="margin">Arist. in libro physiognomico.</note> 
                     <hi>Philosopher</hi> telleth us that a tower-fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned

watered with the rivers of <hi>Abanah</hi> and <hi>Pharphar.</hi> This <hi>Abanah</hi> in humane
writers is called <hi>Chrysoroas</hi> or <hi>golden-streame</hi> from the yellowness of his
banks and water. Otherwise, as little gold is to be found in his chanell,
as at the <hi>golden grove</hi> in <hi>Caermarthen-shire,</hi> or at the <hi>golden-vale</hi> in <hi>Hereford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire.</hi>
However <hi>Abanah</hi> and <hi>Pharphar</hi> were highly beholden to<note n="u" place="margin">2 King. 5. 12.</note>

<hi>Paul</hi> was cast down to the ground, as he went with a Commission

against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities:</hi> and it is reason enough
for the actions of blind zeale, that they are the actions of blind zeale.
Besides, it seems the high Priests at <hi>Ierusalem</hi> had a kind of Ecclesiasticall
jurisdiction over the <hi>Iews</hi> in all places. Some seeming contradiction,
but on serious thoughts easily reconciled, appears in the history of Saint
<hi>Pauls</hi> travells.

                  <p>§ 21. <hi>Aram-Zobah</hi> lay north-east of <hi>Aram-Damascus. Hadadezar</hi> or
<hi>Hadarezar</hi> was King thereof, so glorious a Prince, that his servants wore
shields of gold in war, as if they intended to dazle their enemies eyes
with the splendor of their armes; but all in vain. For the best swords
of steel will command the bravest shield of gold: and <hi>David</hi> at <hi>Elam,</hi>
got an absolute conquest of him, killing<note n="o" place="margin">2 Sam. 10. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Shobach</hi> his Captain, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48509:245"/>
he had<note n="p" place="margin">2 Sam. 8. 4.</note> defeated him and stript him of much rich spoile. As for
those golden shields, they fell not to the shares of any private persons,
but were treasured up by <hi>David</hi> for the building of the Temple, where
this glorious Plate shined in its proper sphear; and where Riot, and
Luxury abused by man, was converted into well grounded bounty,
as bestowed on Gods service. Here <hi>David</hi> houghed the horses of <hi>Hada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezar,</hi>
and onely reserved an hundred<note n="q" place="margin">2 Sam. 8. 4.</note> chariots of them as a Trophee
of triumph to be used for state at publick solemnities.</p>
                  <p>§ 22. Some will censure this as an improvident and unpolitick act,
and character <hi>David</hi> as more happy to get, then able to use a victory;
not casually letting slip, but wilfully casting <hi>such a power of horse</hi> out of
his hand, which managed with a proportionable infantry, might have
given Law to all the east Countrey. Surely it was not done out of a
cowardly suspicion, lest the <hi>Syrians</hi> should recover those horses again;
much less out of consciousness of want of horsemanship in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
to set riders upon them: Rather it was, that <hi>David</hi> being privy to the
deceitfulness of mans heart (how hard it was to have much humane
strength, and not to have confidence in it) did it to wean his subjects
from <hi>the arme of flesh,</hi> that they might more rely on divine protection.
And he did it, to encourage in them, what properly is called <hi>Manhood:</hi>
that they might not expect victories of equivocall generation begotten
betwixt men and horses, but such atchieved onely by mans prowess,
instrumentall to get, and Gods providence, the principall to give them.
Yea <hi>David</hi> might seem to have houghed all the horses in the world, with
that his short, but sharp sentence, <hi>A<note n="r" place="margin">Psal. 33. 17.</note> horse is but a vaine thing to save a
man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 23. It will further be objected, that grant these horses not to be
used in the wars of <hi>Israel,</hi> yet what needs this wast to spoile Gods good
creatures? Might they not have been sold for many talents and given to
the poor? It is answered, that <hi>David</hi> did it in an holy <hi>Brave,</hi> to shew
that the Pagans pride, was <hi>Israels</hi> scorn, and that he as much disdained to
gain wealth by the sale, as to get strength by the service of those horses.
Besides, <hi>David</hi> herein did follow the precept given to, and pressed and
practised by<note n="s" place="margin">Iosh. 11. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Ioshua</hi> in the like case. And indeed multiplying of horses
was<note n="t" place="margin">Deut. 17. 19.</note> forbidden the Kings of <hi>Israel.</hi> But after <hi>Davids</hi> days the Militia
was much altered and managed by horse; by the way, <hi>Absalom</hi> was the
first <hi>Israelite,</hi> whom we finde riding in a chariot, and how he was blest
is not unknown: Afterwards <hi>Solomon</hi> brought many horses out of
<hi>Egypt,</hi> and an Egyptian wife on the back of them, who certainly hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
more, then the other helped him; and generally the <hi>Israelites</hi> were
more prosperous before their use of horses, then ever after; Their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess
was mounted when they fought on foot, but scarce went on foot
when their armies were mounted on horseback.</p>

wish it of such extent as might represent to the Reader <hi>Aram-Naharam</hi>

to congratulate his victory. Long after <hi>Salmaneser</hi> subdued this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey
and extinguished the royall race; witness that brag: <hi>Where is the
King of Hamath<note n="d" place="margin">Esa. 37. 13.</note> and of Arpad?</hi> Though that proud question admits of
an answer; namely, <hi>they were even there, where their sins set them:</hi> seeing it was
not so much the <hi>Assyrian</hi> valour, as the <hi>Syrian</hi> wickedness which cast these
Kings out of their countrey. <hi>Riblah</hi> was a prime city in this land,
where <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> caused the eyes of<note n="*" place="margin">2 Kin. 25. 6, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>Zedekiah</hi> to be bored out.
Some conceive this done in the land of <hi>Nephtali,</hi> others with more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood
in this place, and we (see Reader our carefulness to please all
if possible in this captious age) mention it in both. Yet because this
<hi>Riblah</hi> was many miles nearer to <hi>Babylon,</hi> and further from <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> it
is more probable to be the place, as more for <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi> ease and
<hi>Zedekiahs</hi> anguish: it adding to the conquerours state to fetch the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
furthest from his own countrey.</p>
                  <p>§ 27. <hi>Hamah</hi> the city which gave the name to this countrey, was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
called <hi>Antiochia.</hi> Seven and twenty cities are said to be of the
same name. For severall <hi>Antiochuses</hi> being successively Kings of <hi>Syria,</hi>
stocked their dominions with many cities after their names, as being
either built, beautified, strengthened or enlarged by them, or their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorites.
But it matters not how many younger brethren there be of the
same family, as long as our <hi>Antioch</hi> is the heire, and though not in age, in
honour to be preferred before all the rest. Here the professor of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell
formerly termed <hi>Beleevers</hi> for their faith, sometimes <hi>Brethren</hi> for
their love, <hi>Saints</hi> for their <hi>holinesse, Disciples</hi> for their knowledg, were for
all these first called<note n="e" place="margin">Act. 11. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>Christians.</hi> Probably when many of all nations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved,
the name <hi>Christian</hi> was given them, to bury the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> (thus <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> happily joined in <hi>great
Britain</hi>) which two names though remaining afterwards, were used
as terms of civill difference, not odious distinction. Had this happened
at <hi>Rome,</hi> how would the Tide of <hi>Tiber</hi> have swoln above all his bounds
and banks at the conceit that in her city Religion it self was christened?
But this <hi>Antioch</hi> hath still more to brag of: The <hi>Chair of Saint Peter,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he sate Patriarch many years before his removeall to <hi>Rome:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no wonder if <hi>Antioch</hi> grudge to give <hi>Rome</hi> the superiority. Why
should not that place be the prime, which was the first? Besides, Saint
<hi>Peter</hi> was honoured at <hi>Antioch,</hi> murdered at <hi>Rome.</hi> And why should
that City receive most credit by him, which used most cruelty unto him?
But let Ecclesiasticall Heralds deduce the pedegree, and martiall the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedency
of these Churches, we will onely adde, that this Pharisaicall
<hi>taking of the upper-hand,</hi> hath in all ages hindered the <hi>giving of the right hand
of Christian fellowship.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 28. Now surely no malignant quality in this place, but a principle
of perversness in mens hearts was the cause, that so many famous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
happened in this city of <hi>Antioch.</hi> Here it was, that some <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48509:246"/>
down from Iudea,</hi> maintained the necessity of<note n="f" place="margin">Act. 15. 1.</note> circumcision, and the
legall ceremonies, endevouring to set up a religion (like those monsters
in <hi>Africa,</hi> begotten betwixt severall kindes, partaking of both, perfect in

Judaisme and Christianity. This occasioned the calling of the first
great Councell in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which in fine concluded that this legall Yoke
was not to be laid on the neck of Christians. Here <hi>Peter</hi> being guilty
(it is the expression of<note n="g" place="margin">In his Epistle to the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of <hi>Loraine</hi> prefixed before his translation of Chrysostome on the Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</note>

                     <hi>Barnabas</hi> into the same fault: for which Saint <hi>Paul</hi> presently and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
reproved him. But we will not widen the wounds in good

                  <p>§ 29. But the greatest contention happening here, was that <hi>Paroxysme</hi>
betwixt <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> the one as earnestly refusing, as the other
desiring the company of <hi>Iohn Mark</hi> to goe along with them. In which
contest, <hi>Paul</hi> is generally conceived to have most reason, <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        <item>1 He saw clearly without carnall relation, whilest <hi>Barnabas</hi> beheld
<hi>Mark</hi> his<note n="i" place="margin">Colos. 4. 10.</note> sisters son through the spectacles of naturall affection.</item>
                        <item>2 A reason is rendred by <hi>Paul</hi> why <hi>Markes</hi> company should be
declined, namely, because he<note n="k" place="margin">Act. 15. 58.</note> departed from them at <hi>Pamphilia</hi>
and deserted the work, none alledged by <hi>Barnabas</hi> why the same
should be accepted.</item>
                        <item>3 <hi>Paul</hi> immediately departing after this contention is said to<note n="l" place="margin">Act. 15. 46.</note> 
                           <hi>be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
by the brethren to the grace of God,</hi> which seems to amount
to a generall approbation of his carriage herein. No such pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage
appears of <hi>Barnabas.</hi>
                        </item>
                        <item>4 After this time Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and his acts are celebrated in every

mentioned no more in the history of the Scripture.</item>

                  </p>
                  <p>But we must admire Gods wisdome in mans weakness, sanctifying
this discord to his glory. For whilest <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were newly
converted, and their company needfull for mutuall assistance each to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
their persons and affections were united together: but now
grown strong in grace, and able singly to subsist, God suffered this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
difference to sever them. Whereby the <hi>Gospell</hi> encreased, the one
sailing to <hi>Cyprus,</hi> the other staying in <hi>Syria.</hi> So whereas formerly one
place at the same time did jointly enjoy them; now there became two
Flockes, two shepheards, two vines, two vinedressers, and the division
of Preachers proved the multiplication of preaching.</p>

                     <hi>Nicolas</hi> is reported to have had a beautifull woman

his innocence, he prostituted her to the embraces of any that would
lie with her; with some other strange opinions he maintained. Those
therefore who so undiscreetly express their detestation of one sin, that
they fall foul on the committing of the contrary, may by a spirituall
proportion be accounted mysticall <hi>Nicolaitans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 31. There was also belonging to <hi>Antioch</hi> (pardon a little digressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on)
a delicious suburb called <hi>Daphne,</hi> where <hi>Apollo Daphneus</hi> was adored.
Now (some three hundred sixty years after Christ) <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apostate, the
professed enemy to piety, sacrificed hereto this <hi>Devill-God,</hi> who used to be
very talkative in giving of Oracles, but lately was grown very mute. And
being demanded the reason of his suddain silence answered (forsooth)
it was because the body of <hi>Babylas</hi> (martyred under <hi>Decius</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour)
was buried near his Temple, the vertue whereof stopped his
wind-pipe. Hereupon a conceit was taken that other Martyrs bones
might be found upon triall as terrible to the devill, which gave the<note n="o" place="margin">See M. Meade in his Aposta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieof the latter times. pag. 122.</note>
first occasion to the enshrining, worshipping, and circumgestation of
the Reliques of Saints. See how <hi>Satan</hi> (much delighted in his apish
Parallels of divine service) was ambitious, that a dominative point
of Antichristianisme should have its originall in the same place where
the name of Christianity first began. But long since <hi>Antioch</hi> hath smarted
for this superstition and her other sins; reduced at this day to a petty
village, (standing in the rode betwixt <hi>Scanderoon</hi> and <hi>Aleppo</hi>) and <hi>Orontes</hi>

<hi>Antioch</hi>) much obstructed with sand, and more profitable for good <hi>Eeles</hi>

miserably ruinous. But seeing silkes, though ragged, may be worn

MIDIAN, MOAB, AMMON,
EDOM. CHAP. 2.</head>
                  <p>§ 1. <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore we come to the particular description of
the Countreys, something for satisfaction; why
<hi>Midian</hi> first, and why <hi>Midian</hi> and <hi>Moab</hi> together.
In giving <hi>Midian</hi> the Precedency, we observe se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niority,
he being extracted from <hi>Abraham</hi> the
uncle, by <hi>Keturah</hi> his wife, whilest <hi>Moab</hi> came
from <hi>Lot</hi> the nephew, by his own daughter. As for putting them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we are loath to confess our poverty, that lack of larger instructions
to furnish forth severall Maps, was any cause of our conjoining them
together. The main motive is not onely the vicinity of their habitation,
but also correspondency of severall atchievements betwixt them, which
makes them often coupled together in Scripture. Thus<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 35. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>Hadad King
of Edom smote Midian in the field of Moab.</hi> The Elders of <hi>Moab</hi> and<note n="b" place="margin">Numb. 22. 7.</note> the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of <hi>Midian</hi> were jointly imployed to fetch <hi>Balaam.</hi> The<note n="c" place="margin">Compare Numb. 25. 2. with Num. 25. 18.</note> daughters
of <hi>Moab</hi> and the daughters of <hi>Midian</hi> enticed the <hi>Israelites</hi> to whoredome
and Idolatry.</p>
                  <p>§ 2. <hi>Midian</hi> consisted of two families: one seated southward near the
<hi>Red-sea,</hi> serving the true God, (not so purely but with the mixture of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions)
where <hi>Iethro Moses</hi> his father-in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>law lived, of whom (God
willing) hereafter. The other Idolaters, planted more eastward; the
subject of our present discourse. This distance of place and difference of
Religions gave probability to their opinions, who fancy them two
distinct nations, which is seemingly confirmed, because the former is
called <hi>Madian</hi> in the<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 7. 29.</note> new Testament. But though in some cases we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess
that the difference of a letter, may make more then a literall diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence,
yet here it is not enough to make a reall distinction: seeing He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew
words made Greek often suffer greatermutations then of a vowell,
<hi>Midian</hi> into <hi>Madian.</hi> Others are startled, because the <hi>Midianites</hi> are<note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 37. 25. 27, 28. 39. Iudg. 8. 22. 24. 26.</note> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
termed <hi>Ishmaelites,</hi> whereas the latter come from <hi>Hagar,</hi> the former
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48509:252"/>
from <hi>Keturah.</hi> But it is probable (surely such as reject our conjecture
will substitute a better in the room thereof) that because <hi>Ishmael</hi> was
the eldest son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> chief of the house, all those eastern people de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended
from <hi>Abraham</hi> were denominated by the genericall name of
<hi>Ishmaelites.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>§ 3. It is as difficult precisely to define the bounds, as impossible
compleatly to describe the Countrey of <hi>Midian.</hi> For besides the mixture
and conjunction (not to say confusion) of these eastern people, interfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
amongst themselves in their habitations, the <hi>Midianites</hi> especially led
erraticall lives, and therefore had uncertain limits. They dwelt most in
tents, which we may call <hi>moving towns,</hi> and <hi>extempore cities,</hi> set up in a
few houres, and in fewer taken down and dissolved. Next morning
oft times found them many miles off, from the place where last night
left them. And if we wonder at the wildness of their wandring, and
rudeness of their roving abroad, they will admire as much at the stilness
of our station, and dulness of our constant dwelling in one place. And
no doubt they observed a method in their removalls, as there is a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
as well in the motion of the Planets, as of the fixed Stars.</p>
                  <p>§ 4. For the generall we dare avouch they had <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>Gad</hi> on the
west, <hi>Moab</hi> on the south, <hi>Ammon</hi> on the north, the <hi>Ishmaelites</hi> or <hi>Hagarens</hi> on the east.<note n="f" place="margin">Adrichom. de Te<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. Sanct. in tab. Reub.</note> Some place them more south, hard by the <hi>Dead-sea,</hi> but

                     <hi>Gideon</hi> had the <hi>Midianites</hi> in chace
out of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> they betook not themselves southward (and
surely such Foxes when hunted would hast home to their own kennels)
but ran through the Tribe of <hi>Gad</hi> full east, to their proper habitations.
But now what a slender account shall we make of the towns and places
in <hi>Midian?</hi> But I conceive it better to present the Reader with a map
without cities, or those cities without names, then those names without
truth, or at least wise that truth without certainty, and a fair blank is to
be preferred before a full paper blurred over with falshoods.</p>
                  <p>§ 5. But first we doe behold those castles; and cities of <hi>Midian</hi> all on a
bright fire,<note n="h" place="margin">Num. 31. 10.</note> burnt by <hi>Eleazer</hi> and the twelve thousand <hi>Israelites</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
no<note n="i" place="margin">Num. 31. 49.</note> one man slain in the action) wherein they killed all the males of
that countrey and females which had known man. What time also
they did execution on five Kings of <hi>Midian,</hi> and <hi>Balaam</hi> the false Prophet
their chaplain, who fell by the sword of<note n="k" place="margin">Num. 31. 8.</note> man, though he had escaped
that of the<note n="l" place="margin">Num. 22. 31.</note> Angell. Some may think strange, that the <hi>Israelites</hi> having
conquered this countrey possessed not themselves and their heirs thereof.
Let such know, first, that this sandy land was barren it self, whose best
fruitfulness consisted onely in the largeness thereof: Secondly, God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
an entire territory to his own people, whereas this stragling
Countrey was hardly kept, though easily conquered: Thirdly, the
<hi>Midianites</hi> were of the halfe bloud with the <hi>Israelites,</hi> descended from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
and therefore God would not have them disinherit their kinsmen
of their possessions.</p>

§6. If we goe out of their cities to take free aire in their countrey, see
how thick their tents are spread over the face of the earth. Whereof,
though their coverings might seem course, their courtains (mentioned
by the Prophet<note n="m" place="margin">Habak. 3. 7.</note>) being both the side walls, and roof of their inward
rooms, were most costly and curious. As the <hi>Midianites</hi> were called <hi>the
children of the east,</hi> so none more orient in their apparell, and gorgeous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements.
For if their Camels wore<note n="n" place="margin">Iudg. 8. 26.</note> Collers of gold about their
necks, how rich may their riders be presumed to be in pearles, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
stone?</p>
                  <p>§ 7. Another great part of their wealth consisted in their cattell, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst
which we must take speciall notice of their<note n="o" place="margin">Esa. 60. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Dromedaries,</hi> seeing
the most or best of this kind were bredhereabouts. A <hi>Dromedary</hi> is a dwarf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camell,
nature recompensing his smalness in his swiftness, so that he will
travellan hundred miles a day, and continue at that rate with sparing diet

more) the naturall saddle for his Rider to mount upon, generally more
used for travell then bearing of burdens, and of as much more refined
service above Camells, as Hacknies are above Packhorses. In a word,
as in one respect this beast is the commendable character of perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
not fleet by fits, at the first; but holding out a constant and equall
tenour in travelling: so in another regard, it may pass for the emblem of

<hi>been emptied from their vessell, to<note n="n" place="margin">Ier. 48. 38.</note> break them</hi> in their vessell, and foretelleth
that <hi>Moab should be made<note n="o" place="margin">Ier. 48. 26.</note> drunk</hi> (haply alluding to his geniture seeing he
was begotten in a fit of drunkenness) <hi>and wallow</hi> in his vomit; and

in youth, is a certain prognostick of finall confusion in old age.
So much for <hi>Moab,</hi> leaving it to learned men to dispute, what is intended

                  <p>§ 26. <hi>Rabbah</hi> was the Metropolis of <hi>Ammon,</hi> called in Scripture the
<hi>tity of waters,</hi>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 27.</note> because low and plashy in its situation, conducing much
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48509:256"/>
to the strength thereof, rendering all undermining of it uneffectuall. But
perchance it is so termed from the extraordinary populousness thereof,
<hi>Waters</hi> being often used for <hi>People</hi> in Scripture phrase, both being at all
times unstable and unconstant, and when they get a head implacable,
neither speaking nor hearing reason; both usefull servants, but intolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Masters. Here the <hi>Iron-bed</hi> of <hi>Og</hi> was preserved for a Relick, being
<note n="b" place="margin">Deut. 3. 11.</note> nine cubits high and four broad. Now though <hi>Alexanders</hi> souldiers
are said to have left shields in <hi>India,</hi> far greater then those which they
did or could weare in war, onely to possess posterity with a false opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
that his men were mightier then they were, yet we may presume
this bed of <hi>Og</hi> was not unproportionably greater then he necessarily
used for his ordinary repose. No doubt <hi>Og</hi> confident of his own strength
certainly concluded, that as he did often lie in health upon that bed, so
he should quietly die on the same, whereas contrary to his expectation
he was slain in the field, and now his bed served him for a <hi>Cenotaph</hi> or
empty monument.</p>
                  <p>§ 27. This <hi>Rabbah</hi> was besieged by <hi>Ioab,</hi> to revenge <hi>Hanun</hi> King of
the <hi>Ammonites</hi> his despitefull usage of <hi>Davids</hi> Ambassadours. Here <hi>Uriah</hi>
engaged in battell was killed, though not conquered, by the treacherous
retreat of<note n="*" place="margin">2 Sam. 11. 15.</note> his own countreymen. What a deal of doe was here to bring
one innocent man to his grave? <hi>Davids</hi> wicked designe, <hi>Ioabs</hi> unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
compliance, <hi>Ammons</hi> open force, <hi>Israels</hi> secret fraud, and yet all too
little, had not <hi>Uriah's</hi> own credulous simplicity, unspotted loyalty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunted
courage rather to die then to fly, concurred to hasten his own
destruction. Afterwards <hi>Ioab</hi> having brought the city to terms of yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
politickly sends for <hi>David</hi> solemnly to take his place, to decline all
envy from himself, and invest all honour on his Soveraign. Here the
glorious Crown of this kingdome was taken, and set on <hi>Davids</hi>
                     <note n="c" place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 1.</note> head:

                     <note n="*" place="margin">2 Sam. 10. 4.</note> Ambassadours, should by

wheat winnowed, cleansed, and dressed after the fine and curious

Coming one day hungry from hunting he sold his birthright to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

his profaneness did deliberately confirme, and by that his neglect and
contempt, <hi>he acknowledged a Fine,</hi> cutting off his heires from any recovery
thereof. Indeed afterwards <hi>Esau</hi> made it a main matter of<note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 27. 36.</note> quarrell with

the conditions of <hi>Isaacs</hi> children, giving <hi>plain-dealing Iacob</hi> a more low

high-swelling and ambitious mountains, though he who was nearest

who plow with an Oxe and an Asse, contrary to Gods flat<note n="q" place="margin">Deut. 22. 10.</note> command.
Afterwards, wicked King <hi>Ahaziah</hi> requested again of <hi>Iehosaphat,</hi>

                     <hi>Let my
servants goe with thy servants in the ships,</hi> but the other refused, having foundas
bad success with the son at sea, as lately he had had on land with <hi>Ahab</hi> his
Father. Besides, <hi>Iehosaphat</hi> being sensible how his infant-designe was
strangled in the wombe, and his ships broken at <hi>Ezion gaber</hi> in the very
haven, would not renew his voyage, it being a bold defying of divine
power, to water that project from earth, which one plainly sees blasted
from heaven.</p>
                  <p>§ 36. Other remarkable places in <hi>Edom</hi> were, first Mount <hi>Hor</hi> (hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

put off his clothes the covering of his body, and his<note n="s" place="margin">Num. 20. 28.</note> body the clothes

continued and increased to the last. Witness, <hi>their standing in the cross

Heroes, that mens laziness takes a more compendious way, in stead
of imitating their virtues, practise to abolish their persons. And
yet what clearer demonstration can there be of the historicall truth of
<hi>Iob,</hi> then that his own name, the name of the place of his dwelling
are set down, with the names of his foes, friends, and daughters; and
the whole History as largely recorded in the <hi>old,</hi> as briefly repeated

                     <hi>Testament?</hi> On the other side we listen as little to those
who lessen <hi>Iobs</hi> sufferings, because he lost nothing with in doors, his
Coin, Jewels, Plate, and houshold-stuffe (presumed in a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
equipage to the rest of his substance) remained entire for any
thing we finde to the contrary. But the wealth of that age chiefly
consisted in their stock, so that one may call their cattell their coin,
(Grammarians derive <hi>Pecunia à pecudibus</hi>) bargains in those days not
being driven with money <hi>in specie,</hi> but by bartering of commodities.</p>

for then he should have had twice as much restored: onely the same
number of children were given him, seven sons and three daughters,
because his former children, <hi>non amissi, sed praemissi,</hi> were not foregone,
but gone before. Parents may account on their pious children depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,

                  <p>§ 41. Here I omit the Countrey of <hi>Temah</hi> with some other petty ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories,
all parcels of <hi>Arabia deserta.</hi> Yea the Reader may stand on the
edge of this Map, and there smell the fragrancies of <hi>Arabia the happy,</hi> so
called on good reason. <hi>Misers</hi> measure Paradise by their profit, <hi>Epicures</hi>
by their pleasure: both met here. And it is hard to say whether the
<hi>spices</hi> or the <hi>gold</hi> of the countrey are more renowned. But if heaven
should commence an action against <hi>Arabia the happy</hi> for usurping his
priviledge, <hi>Arabia</hi> would <hi>non-sute</hi> it self, and confess her unhappiness in
the midst of all her felicity. For in default of other fuell they are fain
to burn and dress their meat with Aromaticall wood, which so stupefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
the senses of the people, that they are forced with<note n="r" place="margin">Plim. lib. 12. cap. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>Bitumen</hi> and the

to qualifie their suffocating sweetness. Thus no heaven out of heaven,
and no earthly felicity will fall out even measure to content us, but either
too much or too little.</p>
                  <p>§ 42. It remaineth now that we observe the severall stations of the
children of <hi>Israel</hi> coming out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which cross this map in fashion
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:48509:260"/>
of a Belt. We begin at mount <hi>Hor</hi> their thirty fourth stage in the edge of
the land of <hi>Edom.</hi> Hence <hi>Moses</hi> sent messengers to request a peaceable
passage through the kingdome of <hi>Edom,</hi> but could not obtain it. No
doubt they were jealous of <hi>Israels</hi> greatness, and being carnally suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of them (because Power generally performeth promises, no further
then it complies with its profit) conceived it easier to keep, then cast
them out of their countrey. If<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 32. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Iacob</hi> was frighted with <hi>Esau's</hi> coming
to meet him with four hundred men, <hi>Esau</hi> was now no less afraid of
<hi>Iacob</hi> accosting him with six hundred thousand men.</p>
                  <p>§ 43. However, God commanded his people not to force this, but
finde another passage. It was well more ways then one led to <hi>Canaan,</hi>
else <hi>Israel</hi> had been at a losse. But wicked men may for a time retard, not
finally obstruct our access to happiness. It is but fetching a compass,
making two steps for one; a little more pains and patience will doe the
deed. <hi>Israel</hi> surrounds the land of <hi>Edom,</hi> and next sets down at <hi>Zal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona.</hi>

was, that therein God and the <hi>Israelites</hi> might for forty years mutually
prove one another. And upon triall, they appeared a peevish, froward,

surely, any man would have concluded them not well in their wits,
untill satisfied in the true cause thereof; namely, that God in this their

their clothes, and consumed their flesh; their shooes<note n="y" place="margin">Deut. 29. 5.</note> waxed
not old, but their feet did; their cases were spared, and persons spilled,
because God therein met with so much resistance against his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.
Thus the stock of that generation being wholly wasted, no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit,
or decaied; no impotent, or infirme person entered the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed

back again into Egypt.</hi> And therefore God in his justice, would vex their

God would have them take a second view of that sea, that so their

their memories? Thus scholars who have once <hi>con'd</hi> their <hi>lesson</hi> by heart,
are set again at the weeks end to <hi>get</hi> it for their <hi>part.</hi> Whatsoever was
the cause, sure I am, they were now no nearer to the end of their race,

towards the account of their journey. Wonder I no longer at

Both bad masters, but then their good servants. This latter (though
little observed) was one cause of the long lingering of the <hi>Israelites</hi> in the
wilderness: the pillar conducting them such by-ways, in levels or declivity
of vales in that mountainous countrey, where the water had a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency
to be derived after them. How many miles doth the artificiall
<hi>new river</hi> make, betwixt <hi>Ware</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> finding out flats to expedite

<hi>Israelites;</hi> (though the one was but <hi>beside,</hi> the other quite <hi>against</hi> nature) but

the <hi>Altar</hi> for sacrifices (though plated over with <hi>brass</hi> on each side) was
never fired with the continuall flames thereupon. Some know to their
sorrow how soon such <hi>rafters</hi> or <hi>joices</hi> are set on fire, which by the ill

for the maintenance thereof, and the service therein, men were

son of Noah: as also it was termed <hi>Hammois</hi> (a
name also generall to <hi>Libya,</hi> yea to all <hi>Africk</hi>) being in the same sound
and sense styled the <hi>Land<note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 105. 23.</note> of Ham</hi> by the Psalmist. It had the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean
sea on the north, <hi>Cyrene</hi> on the west, <hi>Ethiopia</hi> (the countrey of Queen
<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 8. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>Candace</hi>) on the south, the Red-sea on the east, with a smal <hi>Isthmus</hi> of land
(not past seventy miles over) betwixt it and the Mediterranean. Many
Princes with as great expence as small success, have oft attempted with
their Pioneers to pierce through this slender neck of ground, so to join the
two seas together, for the greater conveniency of traffick. It seems hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
blasted their designes, as an incroachment on the divine Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
it being onely placed in Gods power to give the <hi>Word of Command</hi> to
the Ocean, <hi>Hither shalt thou<note n="e" place="margin">Iob 38. 11.</note> come, but no farther.</hi> And if it be dishonesty to

alter so ancient and solemn water-bounds of Gods own appointing?</p>

bodies, swarthy and tawny complexions. Hereupon <hi>Abraham</hi> coming
into <hi>Egypt</hi> said to <hi>Sarah</hi> his wife, <hi>Behold NOW, I know that thou art<note n="g" place="margin">Gen. 12. 11.</note> a fair

but (as Stars shine brightest in the night) so her fairness was <hi>now</hi> more
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48509:281"/>
conspicuous amongst the black faces of the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> Their wits anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
were very subtile and searching, esteemed the first inventers of
Arithmetick, Musick, and by reason of the perpetuall serenity of the
aire, they found out the course of the Sun and Stars, first dividing Time
into Moneths, and Years. <hi>The wisdome of the<note n="h" place="margin">1 King. 4. 20. &amp; Act. 7. 22.</note> Egyptians,</hi> is eminent in
Scripture, much given to Magick, and Divination, yea<note n="i" place="margin">2 Tim. 3. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Iannes</hi> and <hi>Iam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres</hi>
the Inchanters have even to this day some in <hi>Egypt,</hi> heires to their
mysterious impieties. As for the wandering Gypsies, which now a
days pretend to the telling of Fortunes, their best cunning generally is the
credulity of others, oft-times not seeing how near their own feet are to
the stocks, and backs to the whipping-post. Yea commonly they are
counterfeites, coming no more from <hi>Egypt,</hi> then the dissembling <hi>Gibeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nites</hi>
did from a far<note n="k" place="margin">Iosh. 9. 6.</note> Countrey, and perchance are next neighbours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

                  <p>§ 3. A most pleasant Countrey <hi>Egypt</hi> was,<note place="margin">The pleasure and profit of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                     </note> and is. For when the holy
Spirit intended to commend the sweet situation of the <hi>plain of Iordan</hi> (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it was turned for the sins of the people into a stinking lake) he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribeth
it to be <hi>well watered every where, even as the Garden of the Lord, like
the<note n="l" place="margin">Gen. 13. 10.</note> land of Egypt.</hi> Nor was the profit less then the pleasure thereof, affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
plenty of the best Wheat, Barly, Rice, and all other grain; insomuch
that this Land was generally <hi>horreum Romani imperii,</hi> the Barn or Granary
of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire. Indeed I finde the same title given also to the
Island of <hi>Sicily.</hi> And no wonder; for the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire being so vast
and expensive an housekeeper, might wel make use of two Barnes for her
provision. However I dare boldly say, that though <hi>Sicily</hi> was the nearer,
<hi>Egypt</hi> was the bigger and better Barn, and yeelded greatest store of corn
in time of scarcity.</p>
                  <p>§ 4. Flax also was a stable commodity of <hi>Egypt,</hi>

day is imported and used in <hi>England.</hi> Of this the finest linen in the
world was woven. The Harlot could tell the silly young man, she
sought to inveigle, <hi>I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved
works, and fine<note n="m" place="margin">Prov. 7. 10.</note> linen of Egypt,</hi> as commonly the worst of women, get the
best of wares, to please their luxury. As for the making of this linen
cloth, it will hardly be beleeved, what <hi>Pomponius Mela</hi> hath reported, that
the ancient <hi>Egyptians</hi> used to have their men keep home and spin, while
their women managed their greater businesses abroad. But surely where
the man puts his hand to the spindle, and the woman to the plough, there
the whole family will be ill clad, and worse fed.</p>
                  <p>§ 5. Horses of the best kind were very plentifull in <hi>Egypt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Egyptian</hi> horses excellent.</note> Those
were a prohibited commodity, forbidden by Gods law to be brought

                     <hi>Not to multiply

they went thither to course horses, they should change religions, and
fall into love with <hi>Egyptian</hi> Idolatry; partly, lest they should place too

much confidence in the legs of horses; or arme of flesh, whom God
would have immediately to depend on his own protection.</p>

This various reckoning, exceeding seven, ariseth, because anciently, some
onely counted the grand and solemn <hi>ostiaries</hi> of <hi>Nilus</hi> (and these, which
they be at this day, let such enquire which are of the <hi>Commission of Sewers</hi>
amongst the <hi>Egyptians</hi>) whiles others cast all his <hi>chanelets</hi> (rather <hi>cuts</hi>
then <hi>courses</hi>) into the number. Since, they fall short, either choaked
up, or commixed, yet still maintain in mens talk the reputation of <hi>seven.</hi>
For, when a naturall, or noted number is once up in the market, small
occasionall variations thereof, more or less, can never beat it down in
common discourse. Thus, <hi>Thomas</hi> is termed <hi>one of the<note n="n" place="margin">Iohn 20. 24<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        </note> twelve,</hi> when
there were but eleven, after the self-execution of <hi>Iudas,</hi> and before the
election of <hi>Matthias.</hi> In a word, the chanels of <hi>Nilus,</hi> daily decreased in
number, because (as pinked or slashed clothes have the fewer holes
the longer they are worn) so his streams fret one into another;
especially, the ground being so soft and tender which lyeth betwixt
them.</p>

                     </gap>ounders, that they are
forgotten. Indeed, in the Criticisme of credit, the Artisans cunning
might cry halfes in honour, with the Kings cost in this structure; but,
both the one and the other, are equally buried in silence, so that the most
skilfull <hi>Egyptian</hi> Antiquary cannot out of these Hieroglyphicks of
pompe and pride, read the name of either. Whilest the poor midwives,
who contrary to <hi>Pharaohs</hi> command preserved the Hebrews children,
are to this day remembred by their names, <hi>Shiphrah</hi>
                     <note n="y" place="margin">Exod. 1. 15.</note> and <hi>Puah.</hi> Thus
memories founded on the rock of vertue, stand firme, and fast; when
they quickly fall, built on the foundered bottome of affected magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence.
Indeed, these Pyramides are of stupendious vastness, and may
be termed <hi>Arts mountains,</hi> though mole-hills, yea, but warts, if compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to those which Nature hath produced. So ridiculous is the unequall
contest in point of bulk, betwixt their severall workmanships, that
Natures pismires may be said to exceed Arts elephants.</p>
                  <p>§ 16. Some to excuse the pride of these builders,<note place="margin">Intended for Sepulchers.</note> resolve their design
on a point of policy, onely to busie their people, to prevent in them
laziness and luxury, (the mother of mutinies) knowing, so rich a soile
would invite them to riot, if out of employment. But (whatever was
their principall project) their secundary end intended such structures
for sepulchers, where the builders bodies lay, not interred, but immured,
with all imaginable cost bestowed upon them. For, the <hi>Egyptians</hi> fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conceived (Reader, pity them, and praise God that thou are better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed)
that the soul even after death, like a gratefull guest, dwelt in the
body so long, as the same was kept swept and garnished, but finally for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sook
it, and sought out a new body, if once the corpse were either care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly
neglected, or dispightfully abused; and therefore to wooe the soul
to constant residence in their bodies (at least wise to give it no wilfull
distaste, or cause of alienation) they were so prodigiously expensive, both
in imbalming their dead, and erecting stately places for their monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>§ 17. The long lasting of these Pyramids,<note place="margin">Their long lasting.</note> is not the least of admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
belonging unto them. They were born the first, and doe live the
last, of all the <hi>seven wonders in the world.</hi> Strange, that in three thousand
years and upwards, no avaritious Prince was found to destroy them,
to make profit of their Marble, and rich materials; no humorous, or
spightfull Prince offered to overthrow them, meerly to get a greater
name for his peevishness in confounding, then their pride in first
founding them; No Zelote-reformer (whilest <hi>Egypt</hi> was Christian)
demolished them under the notion of Pagan monuments. But, survi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
such casualties, strange, that after so long continuance, they have
not fallen like Copy-holds, into the hand of the Grand Signeur (as
Lord of the Manor) for want of repairing. Yea, at the present, they are
rather ancient, then ruinous; and, though weather-beaten in their tops,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48509:284"/>
have lively looks under a gray head, likely to abide these many years in

<hi>Egyptian Babylon,</hi> be here meant by the Apostle? But Popish writers are so
fond to have Saint <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> that here they will have <hi>Rome</hi> mystically
to be termed <hi>Babylon. Good luck have she with her honour;</hi> always provided,

endevour to cut off the entail, that the latter may not descend upon her.</p>

                        <hi>How can I understand without an interpreter?</hi> So here
without the same help, who can attain to the meaning thereof?</p>
                     <p>§ 3. In the first place we may conceive many of these ornaments
were onely temporary,<note place="margin">Many of these ornaments temporary for that age.</note> as used by the <hi>Fashionists</hi> of that age, which
afterwards disused, both name and thing came to be abolished. Which
frequently comes to pass in all kinde of apparell, whose very names by
degrees grow old, wax thread-bare, turne to rents, to rags, to nothing.
For instance, it would pose a good <hi>Antiquary,</hi> to describe the exact
fashion of<note n="e" place="margin">

Conjuration in the mention of them. Yet all these were kindes of gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
commonly used in <hi>England</hi> some four hundred years agoe. Yea,
pride playing in all ages upon conceited opinions of decency, hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
varied the fashion of all apparell, customes of our Ancestours
appearing as antick to us, as our fashions (perchance) will seem in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible

others modest, as <hi>Vailes;</hi> moe (though costly) comely, as <hi>ear-rings,</hi> and
<hi>bracelets;</hi> (which<note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 24. 30.</note>

most of them (some few excepted) though magnificent, lawfull, if not
exceeding the wearers estate. Some therefore will demand why the
Prophet reproved them, and why God was offended therewith? But,
we must know, the things were not so faulty in their own nature,

at a loss how they were fastned. Surely, the <hi>Iewish</hi> women were not

bored through to hang jewels therein. For, although some may plead,
<hi>Pride never feels pain;</hi> as also, that the absurdest fashions, when made
common, seem comely; yet such holes in their noses (moe nostrils
then ever nature made) must of necessity hinder, both their speech,
and plainer pronunciation: except, (as some conceive) they were
fastned with gold, or silver-hoops about thier noses. For mine own
part, I suppose these <hi>nose-jewels</hi> the same with <hi>frontlets,</hi> frequent among
the <hi>Iews,</hi> or else some pendants fastened thereunto:
<list>
                           <item>1 First, because <hi>frontlets</hi> (otherwise ordinary ornaments) are

However, 'tis probable these <hi>nose-jewels</hi> were <hi>frontlets</hi> of a larger size, more

&amp;c. stepping thence to the adoration of <hi>things hurtfull, Dragons, Serpents,

So that one may justly admire that their superstition did not
starve them. For this being granted, that they would not eat what they
did adore, (which is laid to the charge of the Papists, how truly I have

food to satisfie their hunger, besides the objects of their Idolatry.</p>

Being. And therefore to contract the species of their devotion, they
fixed it in a materiall object, lest otherwise with them their God should
be <hi>out of sight, out of minde.</hi> Saint <hi>Lewes</hi> of <hi>France</hi> loved much to hear Sermons,
whilest our King <hi>Henry</hi> the third his contemporary, was more for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at Mass, saying <hi>he had rather see his God then hear another speake eloquently
of him.</hi> This humour of seeing a Deity (though venting it self other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways)
possessed the hearts of people in all ages, who being unable to
raise up their minds to conceive God every where, loved to look on him
bodily represented in some materiall Image.</p>
                  <p>§ 9. Infidelity thus premised as the main cause, two other occasions,<note place="margin">Two occasions thereof.</note>
no ways given by God, but ignorantly taken by men, much advanced
such visible representations: First, Gods frequent appearing to the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs

occasionall, and for the present purpose, was misinterpreted by men
for naturall, necessary, constant, and an essentiall part of his Being: and
thence they concluded him a corporeall substance.</p>
                  <p>§ 10. Secondly,<note place="margin">Second occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of making images.</note> Image-making was much advantaged by some ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions
in Scripture, that God used <hi>after the manner of men,</hi> allaying the
purity of his nature, with humane Phrases, so to work himself the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
down to our capacities. Should God speake of himself as he is, his
expressions would be as incomprehensible as his Essence. Hereupon,

God under the Image, so onely faulty in <hi>symbolicall Idolatry,</hi> and
breach of the second Commandement, serving the true Deity in a false

were directly guilty of dull downright Idolatry, breaking both first and

people, though projecting perchance a longer journey to themselves
to worship God in the Image, tired in their travell, and taking up a
nearer lodging, terminated their worship in that visible object presented
unto them. Thus Gods Spirit, though allowing liberty to the <hi>Potter</hi> of

               </p>
               <p>I know it will be objected, that your Lordship is <hi>infraannu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated</hi>
to be the <hi>Patron</hi> of a Book in the strist acception thereof:
For a <hi>Patron</hi> properly is appealed to as <hi>Judge of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi>
of a Treatise. Yea <hi>Authors</hi> anciently-craved their
<hi>Patrons</hi> consent (as dutifull children their <hi>Parents</hi> leave)
whether that he thought it fit their work should be matched

               <p>In answer hereunto, first I am assured, none of those who

               </p>
               <p>But generally I plead in my own defence, that <hi>Custome

Custome</hi> hath much mitigated the rigor of the word <hi>Patron,</hi>
which is not currant in common discourse, at so high a rate

is denied to many <hi>Patrons</hi> now adays, and they generally used
not for <hi>Censurers,</hi> but <hi>Countenancers</hi> of books dedicated
unto them, in which notion I humbly request your Lordships
patronage of our present endevour.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>London</hi> Gardiners doe not sow or set all their seeds
(though of the same kinde) at the same time, but so that they
may ripen successively, to last the longer in <hi>season.</hi> Such is
my design, planting a Nursery of <hi>Patrons,</hi> all Noble, but of

versed in Philosophy; and demanded of him the
reason of his receipts, how the medicine was proper
for his malady, <hi>why this, why thus, why now, why thus
much, why no more</hi> was prescribed unto him. In like manner it seemeth
unreasonable for Map-makers, here to plant a wood, there mount a hill,
here to sink a valley, there to run a river in their draughts; and then
magisterially obtrude all these on the beliefe of an ingenuous Reader,
without giving a particular account how the same are conformable to
Nature and true Geography: especially seeing it is vehemently suspected,
that many maps are full of affected extravagancies. And must their
fancies draw up the forms for other mens judgments to subscribe?</p>
                  <p>But on the other side it seems not onely an ungentile harshness, but
an unconscionable injustice, strictly to exact a reason for every <hi>Puntillo</hi>
in a Map. Gally-slaves would be in a more freer condition then Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers,
if thus dealt with. As the Poets feign <hi>Atlas</hi> was wearied by
bearing the weight of heaven, <hi>Mercator</hi> would be more tired by bearing
the burden of his own <hi>Atlas,</hi> if questioned for the crookedness or straight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
of every line in so vast a volume. A lawfull latitude herein hath
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48509:314"/>
been ever allowed. For instance, it is generally agreed that <hi>Meander,</hi> a
River in <hi>Phrygia,</hi> runs wonderfully winding; but it breaks not the head
of Truth in a Map, if a curle of that River be made more or less, or be
put out of its proper place. Let the Stewards of Lords Courts, or rather
Bailifes of Gentlemens Manors know each nook of a wood, corner of a
field, reach of a River within so small a compass; such as describe a
Countrey in generall, if truly presenting the most materiall things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
without visible disproportion, doe what their diligence can exactly
perform, and what the Readers discretion can rationally expect.</p>
                  <p>Desiring therefore to acquit my self in the best manner to all ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
capacities, I have here exposed my self to the strongest objection<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

And left scattering of them before in the respective Tribes

far in respect of so many furlongs. Attend I pray you the main scope of

failed in view of the <hi>Israelites.</hi> Which must be acknowledged within the
discovery of their sight; otherwise the land-mark more obscure, then
the staying of the waters that were dated from it. Where therefore the

day teacheth another.</hi> To live, and not to learn, is to loiter, and not to live.
Confessions of our former mistakes, are the honourable Trophies of our
conquest over our own ignorance. The main reason, why <hi>Iabesh-Gilead</hi>
could not be so far north, is this, because <hi>Saul</hi> marched from <hi>Bezek</hi> in the
Tribe of <hi>Ephraim,</hi> with an army of foot, in an afternoon and a night, over
<hi>Iordan,</hi> unto this City, and came hither in the<note n="h" place="margin">1 Sam. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and did <hi>horse</hi> those <hi>foot</hi> in point of speed, yet they almost needed wings,
in so short a time to goe so long a journey (fifty miles at least besides the
crossing of two great rivers, <hi>Iordan,</hi> and <hi>Iabbok</hi>) and to come thither so
early. Wherefore with master <hi>More</hi> we have placed <hi>Iabesh-Gilead</hi> south

other Authors for the position thereof.</p>

little ease thereby was given to the northern Tribes, and their journey

that <hi>Dan</hi> had a parcell of his portion acquired by conquest, near the
fountains of <hi>Iordan,</hi> where <hi>Leshem, Laish,</hi> or <hi>Dan</hi> was placed, which
small territory lay above an hundred miles from the main body of that
Tribe, surrounded about with the Tribe of <hi>Naphtali,</hi> as appeareth in
our<note n="t" place="margin">See our Map of <hi>Dan,</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription. §. 9.</note> description thereof. Now I suppose <hi>Hiram</hi> (whose paternall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction
from <hi>Tyre</hi> is confessed on all hands) was descended a <hi>Danite</hi> by
his mother, and called a <hi>Naphtalite</hi> also by his mothers side, because of
her habitation (though in <hi>Dans</hi> small Countrey aforesaid) lying in the
land allotted to <hi>Naphtali.</hi>

down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire. Then went I out to the
gate of the fountain and to the Kings pool, but there was no place for the beast
that was under me to pass. Then went I up in the night by the brook, and
viewed the wall, and turned back and entred by the gate of the valley, and so

must the arches therein be, to stride over so vast a concavity? What need
of so expensive a structure, seeing an ordinary plank would serve for

Here under favour, I conceive, these severall Scriptures intend one, and

                           <item>3. This slaughter fell on the <hi>Edomites,</hi> who are called <hi>Syrians,</hi> not by

of many nations) but <hi>cause,</hi> and <hi>confederacy,</hi> as ingaging

ranged about with the wals rather for strength, then beauty, being on
the East and South suburbless, and without such correspondency, either
in the number, or position of the gates thereof. In a word, that so exact
structure in the Prophet, never sprang by art out of earth, but was let

both because they being meerly mysticall are alien from our subject, and

                     <hi>My kingdome is not

                  <p>§ 1. POlitick was the practice of the Kings of <hi>Assyria,</hi>

a Countrey, neither to kill the natives thereof, nor to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
them any longer in their own land, but to transport them into a
far distant Countrey, and in exchange planting other colonies in their
room. For, first to kill them (besides the cruelty thereof in cold bloud)
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48509:338"/>
had been an improvident act, men amongst them being precious to
people their vast dominions, which otherwise, if empty, had been more
exposed to the invasion of enemies. To continue them in their own
land had not been safe; who, best knowing the advantages thereof,
would on all occasions practice the recovery of their lost liberty; and
therefore to prevent farther disputes, the <hi>subject of the question was taken
away,</hi> and they advisedly disposed of in far distant places. Lastly, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving
them into other parts, and substituting others in their land,
taught both these plantations an immediate dependence on their Prince,
(having no other plea but his bare pleasure for their present possessions)
which made them, (like the Turkish <hi>Timario<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and daring abroad in their undertakings.</p>
                  <p>§ 2. These reasons moved the Kings of <hi>Assyria</hi> to transport the <hi>Isra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi>
from their native soil. Indeed they, if any people, might term the

so that the same derivative may seem to spring from two <hi>roots,</hi> and be <hi>son</hi> (as
<hi>directly</hi> to his <hi>Father,</hi> so) <hi>collaterally</hi> to his <hi>Vncle,</hi> I mean to words <hi>akin,</hi> and <hi>alluding,</hi>
whence the same in probability may be deduced; and this subjecteth it to much
variety of interpretation. In this diversity we have wholly followed <hi>Gregorius Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorii</hi>
in his <hi>Lexicon Sacrum</hi> (as a work meerly expository of proper nams) though
some perchance will say, that what is the credit of the good wife<note n="a" place="margin">Prov. 31. 14.</note> 
               <hi>she bringeth her
food from far,</hi> is sometimes his discredit in his over strained, and far fet derivations.</p>
            <p>Expect not here from me, after the meaning of the name, a reason of the meaning,
how conformable to the nature of the place. Many Townes were called so, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
they were called so, <hi>ad placitum</hi> of the first imposer. Other places, when first
denominated, had just reason of the same, but this <hi>kernell</hi> long since hath been eaten
up by all-devouring time, leaving nothing thereof but the <hi>huske</hi> of the empty name
to posterity. Now to fix the Hebrew names the better in our memory, we have
here, and there (as the propriety of our language, and commodities of our Countrey
will admit) inserted some English Townes, as <hi>Synonyma's,</hi> and parallel to the Hebrew
in signification.</p>
            <p>The fourth Column is reserved for those texts of Scripture, wherein is made,
either the <hi>first,</hi> or <hi>most important</hi> mention of those plces. As the fifth exhibits the
Map wherein the same are to be found.</p>
            <p>The sixth tenders to the Reader the <hi>Longitudes</hi> of most places, and the rest may
be supplied by proportion. But oh, the difference of best Authors herein! As in
populous Cities an <hi>houre</hi> is lost in measuring of time, the <hi>lag clock</hi> about noon
striking <hi>the most,</hi> when the <hi>forwardest</hi> strikes <hi>the fewest:</hi> so a whole degree of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude</hi>
is swallowed up betwixt the difference of Geographers. Yea, so great is the
uncertainty therein, that in most Maps <hi>lines of Longitudes</hi> (as onely for generall di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rection,
<hi>ne toto coelo errent</hi>) serve to <hi>lace</hi> their Maps that they grow not without
<hi>forme,</hi> or <hi>fashion;</hi> but are not reducible to an exact agreement.</p>
            <p>More is the certainty of <hi>Latitudes</hi> the work of the next Column, as greater their
concernment in our Description, because effectuall in the length of the days, and

computation.</p>
            <p>As for the climate of <hi>Palestine,</hi> in summer time it must needs be hot, lying not

            <p>The last Column containes the Book, Page, and Paragraph (save that the fifth
book is divided onely into Chapters) where any memorable mention is made of such places in our Description. Places out of the Apocrypha, and humane writers
we have omitted, which by their own<note n="f" place="margin">See our first Book. chap. 15.</note> markes will soon insinuate themselves into
the Readers acquaintance, without any farther indication.</p>

            <p>REader, be pleased to take notice, that limitary places, and all other mentioned in
Scripture, which we could not confidently refer to another <hi>Letter,</hi> are by us (though
no <hi>Townes</hi>) consigned to T. which as an <hi>Hospitall,</hi> of no less charity, then capacity, gives
them all entertainment. And thus by Gods assistance we have finished our Table. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous
almost was the execution done by <hi>David</hi> on the <hi>Amalekites,</hi> who <hi>saved neither
man</hi>
               <note n="a" place="margin">1 Sam. 27. 9.</note> 
               <hi>nor woman alive to bring tidings to Gath.</hi> I cannot promise such exactness in our
Index, that no one Name hath escaped our enquiry: some few, perchance, hardly slip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
by, may <hi>tell tales</hi> against us. This I profess I have not (in the language of some
modern <hi>Quarter-Masters</hi>) wilfully <hi>burnt any Towns,</hi> and purposely omitted them; and
hope, that such as have escaped our discovery, will upon examination appear; either,
not generally agreed on by Authors for <hi>Proper Names,</hi> or else, by proportion falling
without the bounds of <hi>Palestine.</hi>
