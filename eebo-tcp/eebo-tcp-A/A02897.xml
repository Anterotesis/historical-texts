            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But on the ſhoare euery place was full of men, ſome quite deade, ſome halfe dead, ſome whoſe bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies yet panted, &amp; plainely declared that there had benne a battell fought of late. But there coulde be ſéene no ſignes or tokens of any iuſt quarell, but there ſéemed to be an ill and vnluckie banket, and thoſe that remained, obtained ſuch ende. For the tables were furniſhed with delicate diſhes, ſome whereof laie in the handes of thoſe that were ſlaine, beinge in ſtéede of weapons to ſome of them in the battaile, ſo ſuddenly begunne. Other coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſuche as crope vnder them to hide them ſelues, as they thought. Beſides the cuppes were ouerthrowen and fell out of the handes, either of them that dranke, or thoſe, who had in ſteade of ſtones vſed them. For that ſuddaine miſchiefe wrought newe deuiſes, and taught
<pb facs="tcp:6393:6"/>
them in ſteade of weapons, to vſe there pottes. Of thoſe who lay there, one was wounded with an Axe, an other was hurte with the ſhelles of Fiſhes, whereof on the ſhoore there was great ple<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tie: another was all to cruſhed with a leuer, many burnte with fire, and the reſte by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe other meanes, but moſt of all were ſlaine with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes. To be briefe, God ſhewed, a wonderfull ſight in ſo ſhorte time, bruynge bloud with wine, ioyninge bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayle with banketting, minglinge indifferently ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters with drinkinges, and killing with quaffinges, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uidinge ſuche a ſight for the Théeues of <hi>Egypte</hi> to pauſe at. For they when they had geuen theſe thinges the loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge on a good while from the Hill, coulde not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtande what that ſight meante, for aſmuch as they ſawe ſome ſlaine there, but the Conquerours coulde they ſée no where, a manifeſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ictorie but no ſpoiles taken away a ſhippe without Mariners onely, but as concerninge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thinges vntouched, as if ſhée had bene kepte with a garde of many men, and laie at roade in a ſaulfe Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure. But for all that they knewe not what that thing meante, yet they had reſpecte to their Lucre and gaine. When therefore they had determined that them ſelues were the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ictors, they drewe neare vnto the ſame: and not beynge now farre from the ſhippe, &amp; thoſe that were ſlaine, they ſawe a ſight more perplexed then the reſte a greate deale. A maide endued with excellent beawtie, whiche alſo might be ſuppoſed a Goddeſſe, ſatte vpon a Rocke, who ſéemed not a littell to be gréeued with that preſent miſchance, but for all that of excellent courage: ſhe had a garlande of Lawrell on her head, a Quiuer on her backe, and in her lefte hande a Bowe, leaninge vpon her Thighe with her other hande, and lookinge downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, without mouinge of her head, beholdinge a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine yonge Man a good waie of, the whiche was ſore wounded, and ſéemed to lifte vp him ſelfe, as if he had be wakened out of a deade ſléepe almoſte of deathe it ſelfe?
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:6393:6"/>
yet was he in this caſe of Singuler beawtie, and for all that his chéekes were be ſprinkled with bloud, his white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes did appeare ſo muche the more. He was conſtrained for gréefe to wéepe, yet cauſed he the maide to looke ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtly vpon him, and theſe thinges muſte they néedes ſée becauſe they ſawe her. But as ſoone as he came to him ſelfe a littel, he vttered theſe woordes very faintly. And arte thou ſafe in déede my ſwéete harte, ꝙ he? or els haſte thou with thy death by any miſchaunce augmented this ſlaughter? thou canſt not, no not by deathe be ſeperated from me. But of the fruition of thy ſighte and thy life, dothe al mine eſtate depende. Yea in you (anſweared the Maide) doth my whole Fortune conſiſte, whether I ſhall liue or die, and for this cauſe, you ſée (ſhewinge a knife in her hande) this was hitherto ready. But onely for your recouering was reſtrained, and as ſoone as ſhe had ſaide thus, ſhée lepte from the ſtoane, &amp; they who weare on the Hill, as well for wonder, as alſo for the feare they had, as if they had benne ſtriken with lightninge, ranne euery man to hide them in the buſſhes there beſide. For ſhe ſéemed to them a thinge of greater price, and more heauenly, when ſhée ſtoode vprighte, and her Arrowes with the ſudden mouinge of her bodie, gaue a claſhe on her ſhoulders, her apparell wrought with Goulde gliſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſte the Sunne, and her heare vnder her Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lande, blowen aboute with the winde, couered a greate parte of her backe. The Théeues were greatly afraide of theſe thinges, the rather for that they vnderſtoode not what that ſhould meane which they ſawe. Some of them ſaide in déede that it was a Goddeſſe and <hi>Diana,</hi> other ſaide it was <hi>Iſis,</hi> whiche was honored there: but ſome of them ſaide it was ſome Prieſte of the Goddes, that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with diuine furie had made the greate ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whiche there appeared, and thus euery man gaue his verdite, becauſe they knew not the trothe. But ſhée ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtely runninge to the yonge man, embraced him, wepte
<pb facs="tcp:6393:7"/>
for ſorrowe, kiſſed him, and made pitifull moane, beinge very carefull for his ſauftie, whiche thinge when the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> had ſéene, they turned there opinions: And are theſe, ſaide they, the woorkes of a Goddeſſe? woulde a Goddeſſe kiſſe a dead man with ſuche compaſſion? they determined therefore with them ſelues, that it was beſt to take harte of grace, and goe knowe what the matter was in déede. When they had therefore encouraged eche other a little, they ranne downe, and founde the Mayde buſie in dreſſinge the younge mannes woundes, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge behinde her ſodainely ſtoode ſtill, and durſte nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſpeake nor doo any thing more for there liues. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſhée harde the ſounde of ſomewhat aboute her, and their ſhadowes before her eies, ſhée lifted her ſelfe vp a litle, and looked backe, but ſtouped againe ſtraight, no whitte abaſhed to ſée the Théeues in harnes, but applied her ſelfe onely to binde vp his woundes that lay before her. Sutche is the force of earneſt deſire and true loue, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſeth all outwarde chaunces, be thei pleaſant or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, onely beholdinge that whiche it loueth, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aboute beſtoweth all diligence and trauell. But when the Théeues paſſed by, and ſtoode before her, and ſéemed that they would enterpriſe ſomewhat, ſhée lifted her ſelf vp againe, and beholdinge them blacke coloured, &amp; euell fauoured, ſaid, if (ꝙ ſhée) you be the Spirites of thoſe who are ſlaine here, you trouble vs wrongfully, for moſte of you were ſlaine with yo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Thus did ſhée ſorrowfully lamente, but they not vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge what ſhée ſaide, leafte them there, accountinge their owne inu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rmitie, a ſufficient garde to kéepe them,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:6393:7"/>
and haſted to the Shippe, and brought out that whiche was in the ſame: euery man bearinge out as muche as he could of Gould, Siluer, Precious ſtoanes, and Silke, not regarding other thinges whereof therein was great ſtoare. And when they thought, they had enough, and there was ſuche plentye as mighte ſéeme to ſatiſfie the Théeues deſire, layinge their praye on the ſhoare, fell to diuiſion of the ſame, not accordinge to the woorthe and value of that they had, but contented them ſelues with equalitie of waight. As for the yonge Man &amp; the Mayde, thei would take order for them afterward. In the meane time an other companie of Théeues, wherof twoo Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were Captaines, came towarde them: whiche thing as ſoone as thoſe ſawe that had benne there before, not of courage to ſturre againſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ranne away as faſt as thei could, without taking with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any parte of the Praye, that they might geue their enemie no occaſion to purſue them. For they were in number but tenne, and thoſe who came vppon them, were thrée times as many. And nowe was the Mayde a priſoner againe, but yet, not in durance at all. The Robbers, although they haſted to the ſpoyle: yet partely, bicauſe they knewe not what thoſe thinges ſignified whiche they ſawe, and partely alſo for feare ſtaied them ſelues a while, thinkinge that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſlaughter had benne made, by the Théeues that had benne there before. But when they behelde the Mayde, though ſtraungly, yet ſéemely apparailled, whiche deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed thoſe daungers that hanged ouer her head, as though they had benne none, and altogeather imployed her tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, to eaſe the yonge Mans woundes, &amp; tooke his gréefe as heauily as her owne ſorowe, they were not onely ſtroken with her beawtie and hawtines of minde, but wonderfully moued with the cumlines of the wounded Mans perſon. Suche was the ſéemelines of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, and taleneſſe of his ſtature, euen as he laye along afore them. For by this time was he a little amended,
<pb facs="tcp:6393:8"/>
and his perſonage had recouered his olde handſomeneſſe againe. At length after they had behelde them a good while, and he drewe neare who was theire Maiſter, he laide hande on the Mayde, and bad her ariſe and folowe him. Shée, although ſhée vnderſtoode not what he ſaide, yet coniecturinge what he willed her to doo, drewe the yonge Man with her, otherwiſe ſhée woulde not onely not departe from him, but pointinge with a knife to her harte, threatned that ſhée woulde kill her ſelfe, if they carried them not bothe togeathers. Which thinge, when the Maiſter partly by her talke, but more plainely by her geſture, vnderſtoode, hoping alſo to vſe his further helpe in great affaires if he might recouer his health againe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted himſelf from his Horſe, &amp; co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maunded his hraneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer likewiſe ſo to doo, &amp; ſette his priſoners on them, Commaundinge the reſt when they had gathered vp the praye to folowe them, him ſelfe like a lackie ranne by theire ſide and ſtaied them vpright, if by meanes of their infirmitie they were in daunger to fal. Surely this déede was not without muche glorie, for he, who was their Maiſter, waited vppon them, and he who tooke them pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, was contente to ſerue them. Suche is the appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of very Nobilitie, and the force of cumlines, which canne ſubdue the diſpoſition of Théeues, and bringe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the wilde and ſauage. When they had gone aboute a ſixtene furlonges, by the Sea ſide, they turned downe ſtraight to the foote of the Hill, and left the Sea, on their right hande. And hauing gone ouer the toppe of the ſaid Hill, they haſted to a Poole that laye on the other ſide thereof, the maner whereof was thus. The whole place is called the Paſture of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> about the whiche is a lowe Valeye, which receiueth certaine exundations of <hi>Nylus,</hi> by meanes whereof it becommeth a Poole, and is in the midſte very deape, aboute the brimmes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are mariſhes, or ſennes. For looke, as the ſhoare is to the Sea, ſuche is the fennes to euery greate Poole. In
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:6393:8"/>
that place haue the Théeues of Egypte, howe many ſo euer they bée, their common Wealthe. And for as much as there is but a litle land without the water, ſome liue in ſmal Cotages, other in Boates, that they vſe as wel for theire houſe, as alſo for paſſage ouer the Poole. In theſe doo theire women ſerue them, and if néede require, be alſo brought to bedde. When a Childe is borne firſte, they let him ſucke his mothers milke awhyle: but after thei féede him with Fiſhes taken in the Lake, and roſted in the hoate Sunne. And when they perceiue that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnes to goe, they tie a corde about his legges, and ſu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>him but onely to goe aboute the Boate, teachinge him euen at the firſt after a new faſhion to goe by a haulter. And thus what rudeſbie ſo euer is borne and bred in the Poole, accounteth the ſame his countrie, and a ſufficient defence, for the ſaftie of Théeues. And for that cauſe all ſuche people come thether very faſte, for they all doo vſe the water in ſtéede of a wall. Moreouer the great plenty of Réede that groweth there in the moorie grounde, is in manner as good as a Bulwarke vnto them. For by deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge many crooked: &amp; comberous waies, thorough which the paſſages to them by ofte vſe are very eaſy, but to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers harde, they haue made it a ſure defence, that by no ſodeine inuaſion they maye be endamaged. And thus muche as touchinge the Lake, and thoſe Roges that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habite the ſame. About the ſunne ſetting commeth home theire Captaine with all his retinew. Then tooke they the yonge couple fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their Horſes, and laide their praye aboorde. Certaine Boates, and the reſte of the Robbers that taried at home whiche was a greate ſorte, ranne to méete the Captaine from out euery parte of the Fenne, and welcomed him as if he had benne theire Kinge. But when they conſidered the multitude of the ſpoyles that they had wonne, and ſawe the beawtie of the Mayde to be ſo heauenly a thinge, they geaſſed that their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions had robbed ſome Churche, &amp; that they had brought
<pb facs="tcp:6393:9"/>
awaie the Prieſte of the Goddes, or rather the liuely pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Goddeſſe her ſelfe. And this they coniectured to the Mayde, bicauſe they knewe not what had benne donne. And therefore they gratulated theire Captaine in hartie wiſe, for his valiante exploite, and ſo brought him into his owne houſe, whiche was an Ilande, farre from the reſte, ſeparated to his onely vſe, and a fewe other, who moſte commonly vſed to kéepe him company. Whither after he was broughte, he commaunded the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to departe euery man to his owne houſe, charginge them the nexte daie all to wayte vppon him. Him ſelfe with a fewe other that taried with him, after they had made a ſhorte ſupper, deliuered the yonge folkes to the cuſtodie, of a <hi>Grecian</hi> (whome he had taken a fewe daies before, that he might be their Interpreter) lettinge them haue a corner of his owne houſe, not farre from his lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginge, with commaundemente, as wel diligently to ſée the wounded yonge Man, as curiouſly to looke to the Mayde, that ſhée by no meanes ſhoulde be anoyed. But he, what with his former trauel the daie before, and alſo with care of his preſent affaires, fell a fléepe. And when al was whiſt in the mariſhe, and euery man at reſte, the Maide tooke that occaſion, and abſence of men, to be a fyt time, to lament and waile, and the rather for that in the night, ſhée coulde neither ſée or heare any thinge, that might comforte her, but contrariewiſe moue her to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe: when therefore with her ſelfe ſecretely ſhée had wailed alone (for ſhée was by the Captaines commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement ſeparated from companie, and layde in a ſimple bedde,) and wept very bitterly. <hi>Apollo</hi> (ſaide ſhée) howe much more gréeuous puniſhement doeſt thou take of vs then wée haue deſerued. Haſt thou not benne ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reuenged on vs, with that, that is paſte? For as much as wée are farre from our friendes and kinſfolkes, and that we were taken by <hi>Pyrates,</hi> and ſubiecte to ſixe hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred daungers more by Sea, but that nowe againe we

muſte on the lande fall into the handes of Théeues and Robbers? beſide who knoweth wither any thinge worſe is like to light vppon vs? when wilt thou make an ende? if in deathe, that ſhalbe voide of Iniurie. Oh that deathe woulde like me well: but rather then any man ſhoulde filthely knowe me, whiche <hi>Theagenes</hi> neuer did, truely with halter I woulde ende my life, referringe my ſelfe pure and chaſte (as hitherto I haue donne) euen vnto deathe, and thereby gaine a bewtifull <hi>Epitaphe</hi> for my ſinguler Virginitie, and no Iudge ſhalbe ſo cruell as thou. While ſhée ſpake thus, <hi>Theagenes</hi> willed her to be contente, and ſaide: Mine owne deare harte and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ioye <hi>Eariclea,</hi> ſeaſe youre mourninge, I knowe you haue iuſte cauſe to complaine, but in youre thus dooinge, you diſpleaſe God a greate deale more then you thinke, neither haue wée néede to prouoke God to wrathe, but rather to praye for that whiche is mightier, muſte with Praiers, and not with accuſacion be appeaſed. You geue me in déede good Counſell (ꝙ ſhée) but I praye thée tell me howe you fare: Better (ſaide he) then I did yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, ſince this yonge man trimmed my wou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>des, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the burninge heate of them is wel cooled. Yea (ꝙ he who had the charge to looke to them) in the morning you ſhal ſée they ſhalbe in better caſe, for I wil prouide ſuche an hearbe for you, that within thrée dreſſinges ſhal heale vp your wounde. And this I haue proued trewe by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, for if any that were vnder this Capitaine ſince I was taken priſoner, in any conflict happened to be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he neuer néeded many daies to be cured. For that I am greatly moued with your eſtate, you néede not mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell at al, for you ſéeme to be in as ill caſe as I, &amp; I haue the more compaſſion on you for that you be <hi>Grecians,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe alſo I my ſelfe am a <hi>Grecian</hi> borne.

Neither at this time woulde I gladly encreaſe your ſorrowes, with repeting mine, beſides that, the night is ſo farre ſpent, that the reſte would not ſerue to tell you the ſame, and wée haue greate néede to take reſte, and ſléepe after our greate trauel. But when they would not ceaſe, but were ſtil very inſtant to haue me tel the ſame, accompting it a greate comforte, to heare any man haue as ill lucke as they had them ſelues, <hi>Cnemon</hi> beganne in this ſorte. My Fathers name was <hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> he was borne in<note place="margin">Cnemon his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent tale.</note> 
                  <hi>Athens,</hi> one of the vpper Senate, as riche as any Como<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the Cittie, he, after the deceaſe of my Mother ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied his minde to Marrie againe, thinkinge it an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable thinge for me, his onely Sonnes ſake, ſtill to be of an vncertaine and doubtful minde. He dothe ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bringe home a little woman ſomewhat fine, but paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge malicious, named <hi>Demeneta,</hi> as ſoone as ſhée was Maried, ſhée reclaimed my Father al to her owne lure, &amp; made him doo what ſhée liſte, entiſing the olde Man with her bewtie, &amp; was very curiouſe in many other pointes, for if any woman euer knew how to make a man madde of her, ſhée was better ſkilled in that Arte, then any man woulde thinke, but eſpecially when my Father wente foorthe, ſhée would be ſorrowfull, and renne to him when he came home, and blame him mutche for his longe tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riynge, and not ſticke to tell him, that ſhée woulde haue died, if he had taried neuer ſo little longer: At euery woorde woulde ſhée imbrace him, and moiſte her kiſſes with teares, with whiche meanes my Father was ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched, that he neuer was well, but when he either had her in his Armes, or els looked vppon her: aboue all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhée woulde haue mée in her ſighte, as if I hadde

benne her owne Sonne, by this meanes alſo makinge <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> to loue her the better. Sometimes would ſhée kiſſe me, oftentimes woulde ſhée wiſhe, that ſhée might paſtime her ſelfe with me, whereof I was well content,<note place="margin">His honeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> miſtruſtinge nothinge leſſe, then that ſhée wente about, maruelinge alſo that ſhée bare ſutche a Motherly affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction towarde me. But when ſhée came to me more wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly, and that her kiſſes were more hote then beſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med an honeſt woman, and her countenance paſſed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtie, then many thinges cauſed me to ſuſpecte her, therefore I conueyed my ſelfe awaie, &amp; woulde nothinge regarde her faire woordes. I will lette other thinges paſſe, whiche would be to longe to tell, by what meanes ſhée wente aboute to winne me, what profers ſhée made, howe ſometime ſhee would call me her <hi>Prety boye,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time her <hi>Sweete harte,</hi> then her <hi>Heyre,</hi> after, her <hi>owne Life,</hi> laſte of all to theſe her faire names, would ſhée adde many intiſementes with eſpeciall conſideration what I liked beſte: ſo that in graue affaires ſhée woulde behaue her ſelfe like my Mother, but if ſhée liſte to dally, then would ſhée manifeſtly declare her loue. At lengthe ſuche a chance befell, when <hi>Pallas</hi> highe feaſte called <hi>Quinqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tria</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The Athenians feaſte called Quinquatria.</note> was celebrated, on whiche the <hi>Athenians</hi> were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to conſecrate a ſhippe by lande, and I (for I was not then ſixtene yéeres olde) had Songe the vſuall <hi>Hymne</hi> of her praiſe, and donne other Ceremonies, and Kites due to the ſame, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as I was attyred in my robes. &amp; my Crowne on my head, I came home, ſhée, as ſoone as ſhée eſpied me, was by and by diſtraught of her wittes, and not able with pollicie to couer her loue any lenger, but for very deſire ranne to me, and tooke me in her Armes, and ſaide, Oh my younge <hi>Hippolitus,</hi> and my deare <hi>Theſeus?</hi> In what caſe was I then thinke you, who euen nowe am a ſhamed to tell you the ſame. That nighte my Father ſupped in the Caſtell, and as it often

Notwithſtandinge you ought to be in good comforte, that the people will conſente eaſily to your returne, and that your Father ſhortely will come to ſéeke you, and fetche you home againe.

As ſoone, as the daie appeared, he commaunded the chiefe of thoſe, who were vnder his iuriſdiction, to come vnto him, &amp; charged them to bringe foorthe theire Praie, whiche by a grauer name, he termed their ſpoiles: and callinge for <hi>Cnemon,</hi> willed him alſo to bringe thoſe with him, who were committed to his cuſtodie, as they were thus carried, oh (ſaide they) what ſhall become of vs? and therewith they deſired <hi>Cnemon,</hi> if by any meanes he mighte, that he woulde healpe them. He promiſed ſo to doo, and badde them be of good cheare, affirminge that theire Captaine was not altogether barbarouſly diſpoſed, but had in him ſome Gentlenes, and Courteſie, as one that was come of a noble ſtocke, but by neceſſitie compelled to followe ſuche trade of life.

Wherefore, I craue this good tourne at youre handes, not for nought, but rewardinge you againe in ſuche ſorte, that of all the other bootie, I will haue no parte at all, for ſéeinge the Prophetical ſorte of men, deſpiſeth the common ſorte of wemen, I haue decreed to make her my companion, not for pleaſure ſo muche, as to haue iſſue by her: and therefore am contente to rehearſe to you the cauſes that moue me thus to doo.

eſpecially aboue all that is ſpoken, to be conſidered, ſhée ſéemeth to be the Prieſt of ſomme <hi>Goddeſſe.</hi> For euen in her aduerſitie, ſhée accompteth it an intollerable, and heynous offence, to leaue of her ſacred ſtoole, and Lawrel garlande. Can there be therefore any Marriage (oh you that be preſente) more méete, then that a man beinge a Prophete ſhoulde Martie one conſecrated to ſomme God? All they that were preſente approued his ſaie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inges, and praied the Goddes to géeue him ioye of his Marriage.

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:6393:18"/>
becauſe that which hath benne ſpoken, moſt touched me, I am conſtrained to paſſe theſe bondes: I preſcribed my ſelfe, to anſweare to the Victors queſtion in ſo greate an aſſembly of men. We were borne in <hi>Ionia,</hi> and are come of a Noble houſe of <hi>Epheſus.</hi> When wée came to the age of fouretiene yéeres, by the Lawe (whiche calleth ſuche to the office of Prieſthoode) I was made Prieſte, to <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> &amp; this my brother to <hi>Apollo.</hi> But for aſmuche as this honour laſted but for a yéere, and oure time was expired, we prepared to goo to <hi>Deles</hi> with our ſacred attyre, and there to make certaine Plaies, and to géeue ouer our Prieſthoode, according to the manner of our Aunceſters. And for this cauſe was our Shippe loden with Golde, Siluer, goodly Apparel, and other neceſſaries, aſmuch as were ſufficient for the expences of the ſame, and to make the people a publike feaſte: &amp; thus we loſed out of the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, but our Parentes for that they were olde, and fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the daungerouſnes of the viage, taried at home: but many of the other <hi>Citezens</hi> ſome in our ſhippe, ſomme o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in ſhippes of theire owne, came to accompanie vs. After we had ended the greateſt parte of our viage, a tempeſt ſuddainely aroſe, and a vehement winde, with feareful blaſtes, mouing great waues of the Sea, cauſed vs to leaue our determined Iourney, and the gouernour ouercomen with the greatnes of the daunger, gaue ouer the gouernement, &amp; within a while after, comminge out of the Hulke, committed the rule thereof to <hi>Fortune.</hi> Then were wée driuen with the winde ſeuen daies, and ſeuen nightes, at laſte, wée were caſte vpon the ſhoore, where in you founde vs, and ſawe the greate ſlaughter in which place the Marriners, as wée were bankettinge, for ioye vnlooked, for deliuery, aſſaulted vs, and for our ritches ſought to deſtroie vs, but they were all ſlaine, not without the deſtruction of oure Fréendes, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintaunce, and wée onely miſerable Creatures (which woulde God had not happened) obtained the Victorie.
<pb facs="tcp:6393:19"/>
But ſéeinge it is thus, we haue good cauſe in this pointe, to accompte our ſelues happy, bicauſe ſomme God hathe brought vs into your handes, where thoſe who feared deathe, haue nowe ſpace to thinke on Marriage. Whiche ſurely I wil not refuſe. For, that the Captaine ſhould be<note place="margin">Cariclia ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth to conſent, but taketh a delaie finely.</note> iudged woorthy the Victors bedde, doothe not onely paſſe all other felicitie, but that a Priſtes Sonne ſhal marrie a woman co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated to the Goddes, ſéemeth not to be done without the ſingular forefight, and prouidence of God. I therefore craue but one thing onely, at thy hand <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi> ſuffer me firſte, as ſoone as I ſhal come to my Cittie, or any place where is an Altare, or Church ſacred to <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi> to ſurrendre mine office, and the tokens thereof. This might be donne very commodiouſly at <hi>Memphis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Shee appointeth the place of her Marriage.</note> when you haue recouered y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> honour of your Prieſthoode, for by that meanes it ſhould come to paſſe, that Marriage ioined with Victorie, &amp; after good lucke celebrated, ſhalbe muche more merie. But whither this muſte be donne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or after, I leaue it to your diſcretion: onely my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt is, that I may fulfil the Rites of my Countrie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I knowe that you wil hereunto agrée, who haue ben brought vp from your childehoode, aboute holy Offices, &amp; thinke alſo very well, &amp; reuerently of the Goddes. With this ſhée made an ende of ſpeaking, and beganne bitterly to wéepe. All they, who were preſente, praiſed her, and willed, that it ſhould be donne euen ſo, &amp; for their partes, they promiſed theire ready aide, to doo what ſo euer he woulde. <hi>Thyamis</hi> alſo partely willinge, partely againſt<note place="margin">Thyamis is ſcante contente to driue of the mater ſo longe.</note> his will, conſented thereunto. For the more deſire that he had towarde <hi>Cariclia,</hi> he accompted that ſame houre wherein theſe thinges were a dooinge, to be an infinite time. Againe he was pleaſed with her Oration, as it had benne with ſomme <hi>Meremaydes</hi> ſonge, and was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to conſente to her, and therewithall he thought vpon his dreame, ſuppoſing that he ſhould be Married at <hi>Memphis.</hi> This donne, hauing firſt deuided their bootie,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:6393:19"/>
and takinge ſomme of the beſte Iuelles, whiche of theire owne accorde they gaue him, he ſuffered euery man to departe, with further commaundemente to be ready the tenth daie after, to goe towarde <hi>Memphis.</hi> He let the <hi>Greekes</hi> haue the Tabernacle that they had before: And with them was <hi>Cnemon,</hi> not as a Kéeper nowe, but as a companion, and <hi>Thyamis</hi> furniſhed them with as good victuall, as there might be gotten. Whereof alſo <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> for his ſiſters ſake, had part. He determined not to<note place="margin">Sight often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times moueth a man to doo ſommewhat contrarie to good te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>perance, and therefore Thyamis ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned this ſight.</note> looke vpon <hi>Cariclia</hi> very ofte, that her bewtie mighte not moue his hotte deſire, to doo ſomewhat contrarie to that, which by common counſell was Decreed, as was before rehearſed. And for theſe cauſes, <hi>Thyamis</hi> would not looke vpon the Mayde, thinkinge it an vnpoſſible thinge, that a man ſhoulde bothe looke vpon a faire Mayde, and kéepe him ſelf within the bondes of temperance. But <hi>Cnemon</hi> after euery man was quickly diſpatched, and were crept into theire corners, which they had in the Mariſhe, went to ſéeke the Herbe, whiche the daie before he promiſed <hi>Theagenes.</hi> At this time <hi>Theagenes</hi> hauinge gotten fit oportunitie, weapt &amp; cried out, ſpeakinge neuer a woorde<note place="margin">Theagenes is offended with Cariclias Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> to <hi>Cariclia,</hi> but without ſeaſing called vpon the Goddes. And when ſhée aſked him whither after his accuſtomed manner he deplored the common miſhappe, or had any newe gréefe befallen him: what (ꝙ he) can be more newe, or contrarie to equitie, then to breake an othe, and finall agréemente? <hi>Cariclia</hi> hathe forgotten me, and is content to marrie another man. God defende, ſaide the Mayde: I<note place="margin">Her wittie an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare to him.</note> praie you be not more gréeuous vnto me, then the miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries I haue already, neither miſdéeme any thinge, by my talke applied to the time, and perhappes to ſomme pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſeinge you haue before by many argumentes, tried howe I am affected towarde you.

<pb facs="tcp:6393:20"/>
all theiſe calamities, but that I ſhall not liue chaſtely, and temperatly, there ſhalbe no torment, that maie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine me. In one thinge onely I know, I haue not ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led my ſelf, that is, in the loue that I haue borne to you, from the beginninge, but notwithſtandinge it is bothe lawfull, and honeſte: for I like not your Louer, but at the firſte concludinge marriage with you, haue commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my ſelfe to you, and haue liued chaſtely without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation hitherto, not without refuſinge you often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, proferinge me ſuch thinges, and haue waited for occaſion to be married, if any where it might lawfully be donne, whiche thinge, at the firſte, was decreed bitwéene vs, and aboue al thinges, by othe eſtabliſhed. Beſide this, conſider how vaine you are, if you ſuppoſe, that I eſtéeme more of a Barbarous fellowe, then a <hi>Grecian</hi> of a théefe, then of him, whome with my harte I loue. What did thoſe thinges then meane, ſaid <hi>Theagenes,</hi> which in that goodly companie were of you openly rehearſed? For in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> you fained me to be your Brother, it was a very wiſe diuiſe, whiche cauſed <hi>Thyamis</hi> to be farre from the Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie of our loue, and made vs to be togeather ſafely. I perceiued alſo to what ende that tended, whiche you ſaide of <hi>Ionia,</hi> and of wandringe aboute <hi>Delos.</hi> For they were ſhadowes which might eaſily couer the truth, and deceiue in déede the Auditours. But ſo readily to<note place="margin">Theagenes is not al ſatisfied with the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare.</note> approue the marriage, and openly to conclude the ſame, and to appointe the time, therefore what that ſhoulde ſignifie, neither coulde I gheſſe, neither woulde I.

For hereby you declare, that you quayle not

But knowe for a truthe <hi>Theagenes,</hi> that at this time wée had not talked togeather, If I had not made him ſuch a promiſe. For drawinge backe with labouringe a contrarie waie, doothe muche kindell the force of vehemente deſire: Whereas in yéeldinge talke,<note place="margin">The propertie of a gentle an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare, in yeeldinge talke.</note> and applieinge the ſame to the mouinge of his wil, hathe quieted his burning loue, &amp; with the pleaſantneſſe of my promiſe, hathe broughte on ſléepe to his haſtie appetite.

Wée muſte therefore (ſwéete loue) vſe this policie wiſely, and kéepe it ſecretely, not onely from all other, but alſo from <hi>Cnemon</hi> too. For although he ſéeme to fauoure oure eſtate, and is a <hi>Grecian,</hi> yet beinge at this time a priſoner, will perhappes, if occaſion ſerue, be ready to doo the Captaine a good turne. For neither this time of friendeſhippe, neither Countriemanſhippe, is a ſufficiente pledge to vs of his fidelitie, and truthe: Wherefore if at any time by ſuſpicion, he geather any thinge touchinge oure eſtate, at the firſte wée muſte denie it.

But he, after he came out, and had ſhut the doore, and caſte a little grauell thereon, with teares, ſaide, theſe eſpouſalles haſt thou at my hande: and comminge to his Boates, founde a greate many ready to runne theire waie, as ſoone as they laide eies on theire Enimies, &amp; <hi>Thermites</hi> alſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge to doo ſacrifice, chidinge him ſharpely, for that he had offered the moſte acceptable offeringe already, went with him into a Boate, and had an other to rowe them, for the Boates that they vſe in the pooles, will carrie no more, beinge but rudely hewed out of the whole Trée. <hi>Theagenes</hi> alſo, &amp; <hi>Cnemon</hi> tooke an other Boate, ſo did all the reſte.

And fought againſte them ſtoutely, and to ſée howe he wounded ſomme, and killed other ſomme, it was a woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſighte. For of ſo greate a number there was none, that either drewe his ſwoorde againſte him, or elles caſte any darte, but euery man laboured to take him aliue, he fought againſte them a greate while, but at length, he loſte his ſpeare, by reaſon that many fell on him at ones, he loſte alſo his Harneſbearer, who had donne him very good ſeruice, for he beinge deadly wounded (as might be gheaſſed) deſpairinge of his ſafetie, lepte into the poole, and with muche adoo did ſwimme to lande, in as muche as no man remembred to purſue him. And now had they taken <hi>Thyamis,</hi> and with him thought, that they had gotten the whole victorie: and although they had loſte ſo many of theire companions, yet in aſmuche as they had him in theire handes (by whome they were ſlaine) they had a greater ioye thereby, then ſorrowe for all theire<note place="margin">The nature of a Theefe.</note> deade Frendes, and Kinſfolkes.

am in greate maruill. As for the reſte (ſaide <hi>Cnemon</hi>) I cannot tell.

In which place, as ſhée at the firſt was lefte, partly for feare of the preſent perilles, partly for that ſhée knew not the waies<note place="margin">Thyamis killed her in ſteede of Cariclia.</note> that wente into the bottome of the Caue. <hi>Thyamis</hi> fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding her in ſtéede of <hi>Cariclia,</hi> ſlewe her.

out of the inner partes of the Caue, a certaine noyſe, and ſounde, (for <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and <hi>Cnemon</hi> were yet in talke) he ſtraight déemed that they had ſlaine her, was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore much troubled in his mind, &amp; could not wel tel what to doo: For the Barbarous angre, and fearceneſſe whiche is naturally grafted in Théeues, kindled the more, for that he was nowe beguiled of his loue, moued him to ſet vpon them whome he déemed to be, the Authours of that murther, but for that he neither had armour nor weapo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he was conſtrained whither he would, or no, to be quiet: he thought it good therfore, not to come vpon them, as an enimie at the firſte, but if he could get any Armour, then to ſet on them after. When he had thus determined, he came to <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and loked about with eies frowning, and terribly bent, ſo that with his contenance he plaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bewraied the inwarde cogitation of his minde. They ſéeinge a man comme in vppon them ſuddainely, ſoare wounded, naked, and with a blouddy face, behaued not them ſelues all alike, but <hi>Cariclia</hi> ranne into a corner of the Caue, fearinge perhappes, to looke vpon a man ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, and naked. <hi>Cnemon</hi> ſéeinge <hi>Thermutes</hi> contrary to his expectation, and knowinge him well, miſtruſtinge that he woulde enterpriſe ſommewhat, helde his peace, and ſtepped backe. But that ſight did not ſo muche feare <hi>Theagenes,</hi> as moue him to wrath, who drewe his ſword, and made as though he woulde ſtrike him, if he ſturred, and bad him ſtande, or els (ꝙ he) thou ſhalte knowe the price of thy comminge, and the cauſe is, for that I knowe thée not, nor why thou commeſt. <hi>Thermutis</hi> came neare him, and ſpake him faire, hauinge rather reſpecte to the preſente time, then for that he was accuſtomed ſo to doo, and deſired <hi>Cnemon</hi> to be his friende, and ſayde, that he had deſerued to be holpen at his hande, bicauſe he neuer had donne him wronge, and had ben his companion the daie before, and that he came to them as to his friendes. <hi>Cnemon</hi> was moued with his woordes, and comming to

the reaſonable parte of the minde, ſo that they looked one vpon an other, and euery one looked what his fellowe woulde ſaie, as touchinge their preſent ſtate, after this, their hope faylinge them, they woulde caſte their eies to the grounde, and with ſorrowfull ſighes, and gréeuous mourninges lift them vp againe, at length <hi>Cnemon</hi> lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſelfe on the grounde, <hi>Theagenes</hi> ſatte downe on a ſtoane, and <hi>Cariclia</hi> leaned on him, and ſtriued a great while to ouercomme fléepe, for deſire to conſider ſomme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of theire preſente affaires, but they with ſorrowe and labour much abated, although againſt their willes, were conſtrained to obey nature, and out of their greate heauineſſe they fell into a pleaſant ſléepe. Thus was the reaſonable parte of the minde, of force conſtrained, to agrée with the affection of the body. But after they had ſlumbred a while, ſo that their eies were yet ſcante ſhut, <hi>Cariclia,</hi> who laie there with them, had a marueilous dreame, &amp; this it was ſhée thought.

But ſhe put her hande to her face, and felte euery where for that eye, which was loſte, and as ſoone as ſhe knewe it was a dreame, it is a dreame <hi>Theagenes,</hi> ſaide ſhée, I haue mine eie, come hither and feare not: <hi>Theagenes</hi> was herewith well pleaſed, and as méete is, (ꝙ he) you haue your eyes as bright as Sunne beames: But what ailed you, or why were you ſo afraide?

Wée are in daunger therfore if we tarrie here longe, either to periſh for foode, or with the returne of our enimies, or of thoſe who haue benne of this felowſhip, if they come to fetche this monie, whereof they all knowe.

But for all that, we will goo, and counterfeite our ſelues to be beggers, &amp; ſuche as goo aboute with certaine Iuglinge caſtes to gette our liuinge.

Hereat they ſmy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a little, ſo that their laughter moued but there lippes onely. When therefore with Othe they had confirmed that, which was determined, and had taken the Goddes
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:6393:32"/>
to witneſſe, that they woulde neuer by their willes for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake one an other, they wente eche of them aboute their decreed buſines. <hi>Cnemon</hi> therefore, and <hi>Thermutis,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge in the morninge early paſſed ouer the lake, tooke their iournie through a thicke woodde, wherein it was harde to finde any waie. <hi>Thermutis</hi> wente before, for ſo <hi>Cnemon</hi> woulde haue it, pretendinge the cunninge he had in that harde paſſage, and willinge him to leade the waie: but in déede rather prouiding for his owne ſafetie, and preparing a iuſt opportunitie to geue him the ſlippe. After they had gonne a good waie, they eſpied a flocke of ſhéepe, and after thoſe, who kepte them were fledde, and crepte into the thicke woodde harde by, they killed one of the fayreſt Rames, that wente before the flocke, and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinge him at a fire, which the Shepherdes had made, did eate of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fleaſh without tarying, before it was thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly roſte, becauſe their bellies were maruelouſly pinched with hunger. Like Woulues therefore, or Cormorantes they deuoured euery parte, though it were but a litle baked againſte the fire, ſo that while they did eate it, the bloude ranne aboute their téeth. But after they had fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their bellies, and quenched their thirſte with Milke, they wente forwarde, and now was it time for <hi>Cnemon</hi> to put his deuiſe in practiſe. When they had therefore gone vp a little Hill (vnder which, <hi>Thermutis</hi> ſaide, was the Village, and in it <hi>Thyamis,</hi> beinge taken in the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile, was either kepte Priſoner, or ſlaine, as he coniectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) <hi>Cnemon</hi> made an excuſe that his bellie was trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with too much meate, and by reaſon of the Milke, he had a painefull laſke, therefore he deſired <hi>Thermutis</hi> to goo ſoftely afore, and he woulde by and by ouertake him. Thus did he ones or twiſe, or thrée times, ſo that nowe he ſéemed to deale truely, affirminge that he had muche adoo to ouertake him, after he had thus acquainted the <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> at laſte, without his knowlege, he taried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde, and as faſte as he coulde canne downe the hill, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

a very thicke woodde. But he when he came to the toppe of the hill, ſatte him downe on a ſtoane to reſte him, tarriynge till night came, in whiche they appointed to goo into the village, to heare in what ſtate <hi>Thyamis</hi> was, and therewithall he looked aboute for <hi>Cnemon,</hi> to whom if he came after him, he deuiſed to doo ſome harme. For he had not yet lefte his conceiued opinion, that he ſlewe <hi>Thisbe,</hi> and therefore he bethought him ſelfe, how he might kill him againe, and afterwarde he was with a certaine madneſſe moued to ſet vpon <hi>Theagenes.</hi> But when <hi>Cnemon</hi> appeared not, and it was nowe farre on the night, he fell a ſléepe, and with the biting of an Aſpe, hauinge gotten like deathe to all his paſſed life, by the Ladies of deſtinies pleaſure perhappes, he ſlepte his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and laſte ſléepe. But <hi>Cnemon</hi> after he had forſaken<note place="margin">Thermutis is ſlaine.</note> 
                  <hi>Thermutis,</hi> lefte not runninge, till darke night reſtrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his violente courſe, ſo that in that place where the night ouertooke him, he hidde him ſelfe, and laide as many leaues as he coulde vpon him. Vnder whiche he liynge, was muche troubled, and ſlepte but little, ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge euery noyſe, and blaſte of winde, and wagginge of eche leafe to be <hi>Thermutis,</hi> and if at any time ſléepe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came him, he thought that he fledde, and looked backe for him, that purſued him not. And when he had luſte to ſléepe, he woulde refraine, for that he woulde not ſléepe longer, then néede required. Laſte of all, he ſéemed to be angry with the night, and thought that it was longer then any other was. As ſoone as with greate deſire he ſawe the daie, firſte he cut of ſo muche of his heare, as he had let growe, that he might be like vnto the Théeues, to<note place="margin">Why the Theeues lette their heare growe.

whiche are in Loue, but Théeues more terrible. When therefore <hi>Cnemon</hi> had cutte of ſo muche of his heare, as woulde make him ſéeme the more trimme, and not be thought one of the Théeues, he made haſte to goo to <hi>Chemmis,</hi> where he appointed to méete with <hi>Theagenes.</hi> And beinge now come to <hi>Nylus,</hi> and ready to paſſe ouer, he ſpied an Olde man walkinge on the banke, vp and downe, who ſéemed to communicate ſomme of his cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations with the fludde, he had longe heare after a holy facio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but a very white, &amp; roughe bearde ſomewhat lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge, his Cloke and other Apparell like a <hi>Grecian.

A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Thrace,</hi> of ripe yéeres, and except <hi>Cariclia</hi> the fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in worlde, whoſe name was <hi>Rhodopis,</hi> I knowe not whence, nor how by the ill lucke of her Louers, leauinge her Countrie, trauailed ouer all <hi>Aegypte,</hi> and came in very wanton wiſe, to <hi>Memphis,</hi> with a greate ſorte of
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:6393:36"/>
Maydes, and Seruantes waytinge on her, very perfitly inſtructed in all <hi>venerious</hi> entiſementes, and wanton behauiour, ſo that it was poſſible for none that looked on her, not to be entangled with her loue, of ſuche an vna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoidable force, was the Whooriſhe allurement, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>céeded from her eies. Shée entred into <hi>Iſis</hi> Temple ofte, whoſe Prieſt I was, and woorſhipped the Goddes daily, and offered diuers Sacrifices, and giftes, whiche coſte many Talentes, (I am aſhamed to tell it; yet I wil) with<note place="margin">Calaſiris falleth in loue with Rhodopis.</note> often beholdinge her, ſhée ouercame me, and that tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance alſo, whiche in al my life, with greate ſtudie I had conſerued. A great while, I withſtoode the eies of my bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> inwarde eyes of my minde, yet at laſte, ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with this affection of loue, as thoſe who are heauy loden, I was conſtrained to yéelde. When therefore I vnderſtoode that a woman ſhoulde be the beginninge of all the ill lucke, whiche the Goddes had appointed me, of whiche I was not ignorant before, and perceiued that by Fatall deſtinie, it was ſo decreed, &amp; that the God, whoſe turne was then to rule, woulde plaie that parte: I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined not to diſhoneſt the Prieſtehoode, in whiche from my youthe I had benne brought vp, neither to defile the Churches, and ſecrete places of the Temples of the Goddes, and to auoide that, whiche was by deſtinie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, not for dooinge the déede (whiche God forebid) but to pouniſhe my deſire with conuenient pouniſhment, as in my minde I determined, whiche by reaſon rulinge in that Iudgemente, I banniſhed my ſelfe, and vnhappy<note place="margin">Calaſiris banni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed him ſelfe.</note> name foreſooke my Countrie, as well to yéelde to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie of the Ladies of deſtinie, &amp; geue them leaue to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine of vs what they would, as alſo to leaue the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Rhodopis.</hi> For I was afraide, my geſt, leſte if he, who then had Dominon, ſhould violently enter into the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, &amp; I ſhould be forced to doo ſome viler thinge. But the chiefe cauſe, aboue all other, that banniſhed me, were my Sonnes, for the ſecrete wiſedome, that I had of the
<pb facs="tcp:6393:37"/>
Goddes, foreſhewed to me, that they ſhoulde fighte a blouddy battaile bitwéene them ſelues, that I might therefore remoue ſuche a cruell ſpectacle from mine eyes (which I thinke the Sonne him ſelfe would not beholde) and to acquite theſe fatherly eyes, of the ſighte of my Sonnes death, I went my way to preuent theſe thinges, pretendinge as though I woulde goe to greate <hi>Thebes,</hi> to ſée my elder Sonne, who was then with his Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father, his name was <hi>Thyamis. Cnemon</hi> ſtarted when he hearde the name of <hi>Thymis,</hi> yet he kepte his counſell, as well as he coulde, the better to heare that whiche fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: but he tolde on, as foloweth. I omitte that whiche happened to me by the waie (yonge man) for it nothinge apperteineth to that, you aſke for. But when I hearde that there was a certaine Cittie of <hi>Greece</hi> Sacred to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo,</hi> whiche was a Temple of the Goddes, &amp; a Colledge of Wiſe, and farre from the troublous reſort of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people, I wente thither, thinking that Cittie which was dedicated to Holineſſe, &amp; Ceremonies, to be a méete place for a man beinge a Prophete to reſorte vnto. So<note place="margin">Calafiris iour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to Delphi.</note> when I had ſailed by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> coaſte of <hi>Creſsye,</hi> &amp; was arriued at <hi>Cirrhus,</hi> I went in haſte out of my ſhippe to the Towne, whither after I was comme, I felt a certaine Diuine O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore bréeth vpon me. So that for many cauſes I accou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that Cittie a méete place for me to abide in, the leſte wherof was not the natural ſighte of the ſame.

For the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the people, that ſaide, the Prophetes would geue anſweare, preſently moued me ſo to doo, as ſoone as I had gonne into the Churche, and ſaide my praiers, and made<note place="margin">Apolloes an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweare to Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiris.</note> a certaine ſecrete requeſt to the God, <hi>Pythias</hi> anſweared me thus.</p>

               <p>As ſoone as the Oracle had geuen me this anſweare, I tell grouelinge on the Aultar, &amp; deſired him in al thinges to be my good God.

I tolde them what I knewe, and was written in the Holy Bookes, and was lawful onely for the Prieſtes to knowe. Howe that the heade thereof was in the hieſt partes of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and formoſte boundes of all <hi>Libia,</hi> at the ende of the Eaſte Clime, and beginninge of the South.

Wherefore it mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreth ſweete waters to drinke, as is like, for that they come from Heauen, &amp; is pleaſant to be touched, not now ſo hoate, as at the firſte, yet is it luke warme, as one that ſpringeth in ſuch a place.

A longe time after I was maried,<note place="margin">Caricles telleth Calaſiris al his estate.</note> I had no Children: yet at lengthe, when I was olde, and had made earneſte Praiers to God, I had a Daughter, the whiche, God foreſhewed me, ſhoulde be borne in an il time. For al that, ſhée became mariageable, and I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided her a Huſbande of one of her Suiters (for ſhée had many) whiche in my iudgemente, was the moſte hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteſt<note place="margin">He was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of Themi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtocles opinion, who rather choſe for his Daughter, a man without Monie, then Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie without a man.</note> man. The firſte nighte that ſhee, vnhappy wenche, laie with her Huſbande, died, either with a Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolte, or els, for that by negligent handelinge, her bedde was ſet on fire. And thus the Marriage Songe, not yet ended, was tourned to mourninge: and ſhée was carried out of her Bridebedde, into her Graue: and the Tapers that gaue her lighte at her Wedding, did nowe ſerue to kindle her Funeral Fire. Biſide this vnhappy fortune, God gaue me an other Tragicall miſſehappe, in that he tooke the Mother from me, beinge too ſorrowful for the Deathe of her Daughter.

After I had trauailed ouer many Countries, at length I came into your <hi>Aegypte,</hi> and into the Cittie <hi>Catadupi,</hi> to ſée the Sluces of <hi>Nilus.</hi> And thus,<note place="margin">Catadupi a Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Aegypte.</note> my frende, I haue tolde you the manner of my trauaile into thoſe places. But I deſire, that you ſhoulde knowe the principal cauſe, why I tel you this tale. As I walked aboute in the Cittie, as my leaſure ſerued, and did buie ſutche thinges, as are very ſcarce in <hi>Greece</hi> (for newe by continuance of time, hauinge wel digeſted my ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, I haſted to returne into my Countrie) there came a ſobre man to me, and ſutche a one, as by countenance, appeared to be wiſe, that had lately paſſed his youtheful yéeres, of coloure blacke, and ſaluted me, and ſaide, that he woulde talke with me aboute a certaine matter (not ſpeakinge <hi>Greeke</hi> very wel). And when he ſawe, that I was willinge to goe with him, he brought me into a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Temple, and by and by, ſaide, I ſawe you buie cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Hearbes, and Rootes that growe in <hi>India,</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia.</hi> If you wil buie ſuch thinges of me, in good faith, &amp; without guile, I wil ſhewe you them with al my harte.

Theſe were like the Sea banke, that lieth vnder a harde rocke, which maketh all that is vnderneath to be like Purple coloure. At fewe woordes, their mingled, and diuers ſhining colour, delighted and pleaſed the eies wonderfully, whiche as ſoone as I ſawe. You muſt ſéeke

other Chapmen (ꝙ I) good Sir, for I, &amp; al my ritches are ſcant able to buie one of the ſtoones that I ſée. Why ſaide he, if you be not able to buie the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet are you able to take them, if they be géeuen you. I am able, ſaide I, to receiue them in déede, but I knowe not what you meane ſo to mocke me. I mocke you not, ꝙ he, but meane good faithe, &amp; I ſweare by the God of this Churche, that I will geue you al theſe thinges, if you wil take them, beſide an other gifte, whiche farre excelleth them all. I laughed when I heard this, he aſked me why I laughed. Becauſe, ꝙ I, it is a thinge to be laughed at: ſéeinge you promiſe me thinges of ſo greate price, and yet aſſure me to géeue me more. Truſte me, ſaide he: but ſweare that you will vſe this gifte well, and as I ſhall teache you. I maruailed what he meante, and ſtayed a while, yet in hope of thoſe greater rewardes, I tooke an Othe. After I had ſworne, as he willed me, he brought me to his Lodginge, and ſhewed me a Mayde of excellente bewtie, which he ſaide, was but ſeuen yéere Olde, me thought ſhée was almoſte Marriageable, ſuche grace dothe excellente bewtie geue<note place="margin">What excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t bewtie with taleneſſe of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, maketh a woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſeemely.</note> to the taleneſſe of Stature. I ſtoode in a maſe, aſwell for that I knewe not what he meante, as alſo for the vnſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable deſire I had to looke vpon her. Then ſpake he thus to me. Sir, the Mother of this Mayde, whiche you ſée, for a certaine cauſe, that you ſhal knowe hereafter, laide her foorthe, wrapped in ſuche Apparell as is commonly vſed<note place="margin">Cariclia layde foorthe, and committed to Fortune. That it is not lawfull to lette one die with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuccoure, is a precepte of the Gymnoſophiſis.</note> for ſuche pourpoſes, committinge her to the doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Fortune. And I by channce findinge her, tooke her vp, for it is not lawful to deſpiſe and neglecte a ſoule in daunger, after it hath once entered into an Humayne bodie. For this is one of the <hi>VViſe mens</hi> preceptes, that are with vs, to be, whoſe Scholer my ſelfe was once iudged woorthy. Beſides that euen in the Infantes eies there appeared ſome wonderfull thinge, ſhée behelde me with ſuche a ſteadie, and amiable countenaunce, as I loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked vpon her. With her was alſo founde this bagge of

precious ſtoanes whiche I ſhewed you of late, and a Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken clothe wrought with letters in her Mother tongue, wherein was her whole eſtate contained, her Mother as<note place="margin">Cariclias estate written in her Faſcia.

Whiche after I had redde, I knew whence, and what ſhée was, and ſo I carried her into the Countrie farre from the Cittie, and deliuered her to certaine Shepeheardes to be broughte vp, with charge that they ſhould tel no man. As for thoſe thinges that were founde with her, I detained with my ſelfe, leaſte for them, the Maide ſhoulde be brought into any daunger. And thus at the firſte this matter was concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: But after, in proceſſe of time, the Mayde growinge on, and becominge more fayre, then other wemen were (for bewtie in mine opinion cannot be concealed, though<note place="margin">Bewtie cannot be hidde.</note> it were vnder the grounde, but woulde thence alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare) fearinge leaſte her eſtate ſhould be knowen, and ſo ſhée killed, and I brought in trouble therefore, I ſewed, that I might be ſente in Ambaſſadge, to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of <hi>Aegypte,</hi> and obtained, wherefore I come, and bringe her with me, deſirous to ſette her buſines in good order. And now muſte I vtter to him the cauſe of mine Ambaſſadge, for he hath appointed this daie for the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringe<note place="margin">Cariclia deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Caricles.</note> of me. As touching the Mayde, I commende her to you, and the Goddes, who haue hitherto conſerued her, vpon ſuch conditions, as you are bounde by Othe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourme. That is, that you wil vſe her as a Frée woman, and marrye her to a Frée man, as you receiue her at my hande, or rather of her Mother, who hathe ſo leafte her. I hope that you wil perfourme al thinges whereof we haue commoned, aſwel by credite of your othe, as alſo by truſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> I haue in your maners, whiche I haue by many daies experienced to be very <hi>Greekiſhe</hi> in déede. Thus much I had to ſay to you, before I executed my co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>miſſion, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerninge mine Ambaſſadge: as for other ſecreſies belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to the maide, I wil tel you them to morow in more ample wiſe, if you wil mete with me about Iſis temple. I

did as he requeſted, and caried the maide muffled to mine owne houſe, and vſed her very honorably that daie, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortinge her with many faire meanes, &amp; gaue God greate<note place="margin">Caricles calleth Cariclia his owne Daughter ofte, and named her after his owne name.</note> thankes for her, from that time hitherto, accoumpting, &amp; meaning her my daughter. The next daie, I went to Iſis Temple, as I had appointed with the ſtranger, and after I had walked there a greate while alone, and ſawe him not, I wente to the Deputies houſe, &amp; inquired whether any man ſawe the Legate of <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> The one tolde me, that he was gonne, or rather dryuen homeward, the laſt day before Sunne ſette, for that the Deputie thretned to<note place="margin">Siſimithers his Ambaſſadge.</note> kyll hym, if preſently he departed not. I aſked him the cauſe, for that, quoth he, by his Ambaſſadge he willed him not to meddle with y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> mines, out of which, the Sma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radges were digged, as thoſe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> appertained to <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> I came home againe, much greued, like one that had had ſome greate miſhap, becauſe I coulde not knowe any thynge as touchynge the mayde, neither whence ſhée was, or who were her Parentes. Maruaile not thereat, ſaide <hi>Cnemon,</hi> interpretinge him, for I my ſelfe take it heauily, that I cannot knowe it nowe: yet perhaps I ſhal knowe it hereafter. You ſhal in déede, ſaide <hi>Calaſiris.</hi> But nowe wil I telle you, what <hi>Caricles</hi> ſaide more. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I came into my houſe (quoth he) the maide came foorth to méete me, but ſaide nothinge, bicauſe ſhée coulde not yet ſpeake <hi>Greeke:</hi> yet ſhée tooke me by the hande, and made me good chéere with her countenance. I marueiled, that euen as good Grayehoundes doo fawne vpon euery one, though they haue but litle acquaintance with them, ſo ſhée quickly perceiued my good wil towarde her, and did imbrace me, as if I had benne her Father. I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined therefore, not to tarry longer in <hi>Catadupi,</hi> leſte ſome ſpite of the Goddes ſhoulde depriue me of my other Daughter too, and ſo comminge by Boate dawne alonge <hi>Nilus,</hi> to the Sea, I gotte a Shippe, &amp; ſailed home, &amp; now in this my Daughter with me, this Daughter, I ſaie,

The whole nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of theſe youthes was fiftie, whiche was deuided into twiſe fiue &amp; twentie, in a manner garded their Captaine, who rode in the middeſt of them. Their Bootes wrought with Purple Lether,<note place="margin">The Aenians apparell.</note> were foulded finely alitle aboue their ancles. Their clokes were buttened with Buttons of Golde before their breaſtes, and were laide on with rownde blewe Buttons, downe vnto the nethermoſte hemme. Their Horſes came all out of <hi>Theſſalia,</hi> whiche alſo ſhewed by their pleaſaunt countenaunces, the good Paſturage of their Countrie.

But, <hi>Cnemon,</hi> thoſe who were preſent, did ſo deſpiſe, and paſſe theſe menne thus apparailed, and looke on the Captaine <hi>Theagenes</hi> (on whom was my care) that all, whiche ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed<note place="margin">Theagenes his cloke with what was wrought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> before very bright, was nowe darkened, as it had benne with ſome paſſinge lightninge. Suche brightneſſe did his ſight bringe vnto vs, in as muche as he was on Horſebacke alſo, with a Speare of Aſhe, pointed with
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:6393:44"/>
ſtéele in his hande, he had no Helmet on: but was bare headed. His cloke was of Purple wrought with Golde, wherein was the battaile of the <hi>Centaures, and Lapithes:</hi> on the Button of his cloke, was <hi>Pallas</hi> pictured, bearing a Shilde before her breaſte wherein was <hi>Gorgons</hi> head. The comelineſſe, and commendation of that which was donne, was ſommewhat increaſed by the eaſy blowinge of the winde. Whiche moued his heare about his necke, parting it before his forehead, and made his cloke waue, and the nether partes thereof to couer the backe, &amp; but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tockes of his Horſe. You woulde haue ſaide, that his<note place="margin">Theagenes his Horſe.</note> Horſe did knowe the bewtie of his Maiſter, and that he beinge very faire him ſelfe, did beare a paſſinge ſéemely man, he rained ſo, and with priked vp eares, he toſſed his heade, and rowled his eies fiercely, and praunſed, &amp; leapte in ſo fine ſorte. When he had the raines a litle at will, he woulde ſet forewarde couragiouſly, and turne a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout on bothe ſides, &amp; beate the grounde with the tippes of his houfes lightly, and moderate his fierceneſſe, with the pleaſantneſſe of his Pace. Eche man was amazed thereat, and gaue the yonge man the principal praiſe, as wel for his courage, as alſo for bewtie, and comelineſſe of perſonage. At a woorde the common ſorte of women,<note place="margin">VVhat the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſorte of weemen did to Theagenes, and their opinion of him.</note> and ſuche as coulde not moderate theire affections, caſte Apples, &amp; Floures vpon him, by that meanes, as might be geaſſed, ſéekinge to get his fauoure. For they were al of this opinion, that there could be no humaine ſhape, whiche coulde ſurmounte the ſéemelineſſe of <hi>Theagenes.</hi> But after that <hi>Aurora,</hi> with roſiall fingers, as ſaithe <hi>Homer,</hi> appeared, and the bewtifull, and wiſe <hi>Cariclia,</hi> came out of <hi>Dianas</hi> Temple. Then I perceiued that<note place="margin">Theagenes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to loue Cariclia.</note> 
                  <hi>Theagenes</hi> coulde be conquered, but ſo farre conquered, as the natural ſéemelineſſe of womans bewtie hath the more, and greater force at firſt to bringe vnder. For ſhée was carried in a Chariot, drawen with a yoke of white<note place="margin">Howe Cariclia was attyred.</note> Oxen, ſhée had on a purple Gowne downe to her foote,
<pb facs="tcp:6393:45"/>
ſpangled with Golde. Shée was girded with a girdel, in making wherof, the woorkeman beſtowed al his craft, in y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> he neuer made the like before, nor hable to frame ſuch<note place="margin">Cariclias Gir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell.</note> an other after. For he tied twoo <hi>Dragons</hi> tayles behinde her backe, bitwéene her ſhoulders, bringing further their contrarie neckes vnder her pappes, with an artificiall knotte, ſufferinge bothe theire heades to hange downe after it was faſtened aboute her. You woulde haue ſaide that the Serpentes, did not ſéeme to créepe, but crepte in déede. They were not feareful with their terrible lookes, but ſéemed as though they had ben wantonly a ſléepe. As touchinge their matter, they were Golde, but in colour blewe. For the Golde by arte, was made blacke, that blacke, and blewe, might in déede repreſente the ſharpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, and diuerſitie of ſcales, and ſuche was the Maides Girdel. Her heare was neither al bounde vp, nor al looſe: but the moſte parte thereof that grewe behinde, hanged ouer her ſhoulders, that whiche grewe from the crowne of her head downewarde to her forehead, being yealowe coloured, was crowned with a Garlande of yonge Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, whiche did not ſuffer the whole to be blowen more then was ſéemely with the vehemencie of the winde. In her leafte hande ſhee bare a gilted Bowe, and a quiuer of Arowes hanged on her right ſhoulder, and in her other hande ſhée bare a Taper burning, and although ſhe were ſo attyred, yet there came greater lighte from her eies, then from the Taper. Thoſe ſame are <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and <hi>Cariclia</hi> in déede, ſaide <hi>Cnemon. Calaſiris</hi> thinkinge that he had ſpied them ſomewhere, aſked him, and where be they? ſhewe me them for Goddes ſake.

So faire and ſo happie, were they as menne had felicitie yenough, if they were like

him, and wéemen if they were like her. For they coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it an immortal thinge to be ſuche a couple. Although the people of that Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie rather praiſed the yong man, and the <hi>Theſſalians,</hi> the Maide, bothe praiſing that won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully whiche they neuer ſawe before. For a newe countenance, and ſeldome ſéene doothe more moue the minde, then that wherewith wée are dayly acquainted. But oh delectable deceite, O acceptable opinion, howe dideſt thou comfort me, <hi>Cnemon,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I hoped that thou haddeſt ſéene my deare Childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; wouldeſt haue ſhewed me them?

Be contente, quothe he, and feare not, for they wil come without doubt. Perhaps there is ſome let, that they come not ſo ſoone as was appointed betwixte vs, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, If they were here, I woulde not ſhewe you the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, before I had the whole Hier that you promiſed me. Wherefore, if you deſire to ſée them in haſte, perfourme that you promiſed, and make an ende of your vnperfite tale. I, quoth he, am very vnwillinge to doo that whiche bringeth me in minde of that whiche gréeueth me much, and I ſuppoſed that you had benne weary of this my ſo longe pratlinge. But ſéeinge you be ſo deſirous to heare, and can neuer be wearied with a good tale, goe too, let vs procéede where wée lefte. Yet firſte let vs light a Candel,<note place="margin">Calaſiris was very ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious.</note> and doo Sacrifice to the Gods, that gouerne in the night, that hauing perfourmed the accuſtomable Ceremonies, wée maie lie quietly, and tel forewarde our tale. He ſaide thus, and foorthwith a Mayde brought in a Candel ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and he finiſhed his Sacrifice, and called vpon diuers of the Goddes, but eſpecially vpon <hi>Mercurie,</hi> and deſired to haue ſome happy dreame that night, &amp; that his derely beloued children, mighte appeare vnto him in his ſléepe,

he praied humbly, when he had thus donne, he ſaide, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that the yonge menne had gonne thrée times aboute <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> his Sepulture, in their brauerie on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>backe, the Wéemen cried out pitiouſly, and the Menne made a ſtrange noyſe. Therewithall ſuddainely all the Oxen, Rammes, and Goates, were killed, as if they had benne ſlaine at one ſtroke: laſte of all, when the Aultare beinge of wonderful greatneſſe had ſixe hundred clouen logges laide vpon it, &amp; all manner of lawful offeringes were added thereunto, they made requeſt, that <hi>Apolloes</hi> Prieſte might beginne the Sacrifice. <hi>Caricles</hi> ſaide, that<note place="margin">The manner of the Sacrifice with the ductie of the Prieſte of Apollo, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Surely, <hi>Cnemon,</hi> that the minde is a heauenly thinge, and of grete affinitie with the ſuperiour nature, wée maie knowe by the déedes, and woorkes thereof. For they looked one vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> an other, as though the minde knew firſte that, whiche was like to it ſelfe, and did approche neare to that, whiche bothe in excellencie, and Dignitie was of affinitie to it. At the firſte therefore they ſtoode ſtill ſuddainely, as though they had benne amazed. And ſhée deliuered her Taper with a conſtant countenaunce, and he likewiſe receiued it, and viewed one an other<note place="margin">The ſundrie countenaunces, and behauiours of Louers.</note> with ſo ſtedie eyes, as if either had ſéene, and knowen other before, and nowe coulde not call to remembraunce where.

Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwarde as though they were aſhamed of that they did, they bluſhed: within a while after, when this affection, as I thinke, had griped theire hartes, they became pale. At a woorde, ſixe hundred countenaunces appeared in theire faces in ſhorte time, and the changinge of all kinde of coloure, and the rowlinge of their eies, plainely

betokened the troubles in theire minde. The people y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> were preſente, as maie be gheaſſed, perceiued not this, bicauſe euery one thoughte of diuerſe matters, neither <hi>Caricles,</hi> who at that time, repeted the vſuall Prayer. Onely I did nothinge, but marke the yonge Couple, after that the Oracle ſpake of <hi>Theagenes,</hi> dooinge Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in the Temple, and by coniecture of their names, was moued to ſuſpecte that, whiche after ſhoulde come to paſſe, yet I knewe nothinge exquiſitly, of that whiche was ſignified in the later parte of the anſweare. But after that at length, and as it were by force, <hi>Theagenes</hi> was withdrawen from the Mayde, and with his Taper ſet fire on the Aultare, the Pompe was broken vp, and the <hi>Theſſalians</hi> wente to bankettinge, &amp; al the other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wente euery man to his owne houſe. <hi>Cariclia</hi> alſo puttinge on a white cloke, with a fewe of her familiars, wente into her owne Chamber, whiche was within the compaſſe of the Temple. For ſhée dwelled not with her ſuppoſed Father, but altogeather ſeparated her ſelfe from him, that ſhée might not be diſſuaded from her pourpoſe. I beinge nowe made more curious, by reaſon of that I had harde, and ſéene, came to méete <hi>Caricles</hi> of ſet pourpoſe. Who aſked me, ſawe you <hi>Cariclia,</hi> my ioye, and the honoure of the people of <hi>Delphos?</hi> This was not the firſte time (quoth I) but I ſawe her before, as ofte as the people reſorted to the Temple, not as one that ſtoode a farre of, as the Prouerbe is, but ſhée hath donne Sacrifice togeather with me, and if ſhée doubted of any pointe, either of Diuine, or humaine matters, ſhée woulde aſke me, and I tolde her. Howe liked you her at this time, quoth he? Did ſhée ſet foorthe this braue ſight any whitte? Mary Sir <hi>Caricles</hi> (quoth I) you ſéeme to aſke me, whether the Moone doo excéede any whitte the the leſſer Starres.

But in déede they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleged

your Danghter to be the principall ſhewe, yea and the very eye of the Pompe. <hi>Caricles</hi> was well pleaſed with this (and I beganne nowe to drawe to the pourpoſe, eſpecially deſiringe that he woulde be of good harte, and doubte nothinge) who ſmilinge alitle ſayde, I goe to her nowe, and if it pleaſe you, goe with me, and let vs ſée, whether this greate companie hathe benne any thinge noyſome vnto her. I was very glad of this requeſte, yet I made as though, I had other bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe to doo: but was contente to leaue that, and goe with him. After wée came where ſhée was, and had gonne into her chamber, wée founde her ſicke on her bedde, and coulde take no reſte, and all her eyes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dewed<note place="margin">Cariclia in Loue.</note> with lowe droppes. After her Father was come in, and ſhée (as was her manner) had imbraced him, he aſked her what ſhée ayled. Sée made him anſweare, that her heade did ake, and that ſhée woulde fayne ſléepe if ſhée might. <hi>Caricles</hi> mutche gréeued with this, wente out of her chamber with me, and commaunded the Maydes, to make as litle noyſe as mighte be, and after he came before his owne houſe, he ſayde. What ſhoulde this meane good <hi>Calaſiris?</hi> What diſeaſe hathe my deare Daughter? Maruell not, quoth I, if ſhée hauinge ſhewed her ſelfe in ſutche a companie, hathe benne ſpied by ſomme ſpitefull eye. He ſmiled at this, and ſayde in ieſtinge wiſe, you then doo beléeue, as menne commonly doo, that there is Witchcrafte. Yée mary, quoth I, and verily, as I thinke there is any thinge true, and that for this cauſe.

And perhaps you haue hearde how the Serpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Baſiliſcus</hi> with his onely breathe and looke, dothe drie vp and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupte, all that it paſſeth by: and it is no maruell if ſome doo bewitche, ſuche as they holde moſte déere, and wiſhe beſte vnto, for ſeinge they be enuious by nature, thei doo not what they woulde, but what by nature they are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. After he had ſtaied a little at this, he ſaide, you haue diſcuſſed this doubte right wiſely, and with very probable argumentes. I woulde to God that ſhée might once féele what affection and loue meaneth: Then would
<pb facs="tcp:6393:48"/>
I not thinke that ſhée were ſicke, but in moſte perfite healthe, and you knowe that I haue craued your healpe to bringe this aboute. But now nothinge leſſe then this is to be feared, to haue happened to her, who hateth her bedde, and will be wonne with no Loue, but ſhée ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſemeth to be bewitched in déede: and I doubte not, but you will vndoo this witchcrafte, for the friendſhippe whiche is betwixte vs, and to ſhewe vs ſome pointe of your ſingular wiſedome, I promiſed him if I coulde per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue her gréefe, to healpe her what I coulde. And while wée yet talked of their matters, one came to vs in haſt, and ſaide: Good ſirs, you make ſuche tariance, as if you ſhould come to a battaile, or ſkyrmiſhe, and not to a ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket: The maker whereof, is the excellent <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and great <hi>Neoptolemus</hi> the preſident at the ſame. Come the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, neither let the Banket through your defaulte, be continewed till nighte, ſeinge none, but you, are awaie. This felowe (ꝙ <hi>Caricles</hi> to me in mine eare) biddeth vs with a cudgil in his hand. O what a lofty felow <hi>Bacchus</hi> is, if he be well waſhed. But let vs goo, for it is to be doubted, leaſt if wée tarrie, he wil driue vs forward. You ieſt, ſaide I, yet I am pleaſed, let vs goo in déede. When wée came, <hi>Theagenes</hi> placed <hi>Caricles</hi> beſide him ſelfe, and honoured me alſo ſomewhat for his ſake. Why doo I trouble you nowe, with tellinge how the Maydes daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and what inſtrumentes were there, and howe the yonge youthes daunced the daunce called <hi>Pyrricha</hi> in armoure, &amp; others, whiche <hi>Theagenes</hi> had mingled with fine and delicate meates, orderinge his banket, as if it had benne but a Drinkinge, but that whiche is néedefull for you to heare, and pleaſaunt for one to tel, was thus, <hi>Theagenes</hi> ſette a mery countenance on the matter, and ſtrained him ſelfe wonderfully that he might intertaine<note place="margin">Calaſiris eſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes was in Loue.</note> his gheaſtes courteouſly, &amp; make them good chéere. But I perceiued whereto his minde was bente, by the row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge of his eyes, and ſuddaine ſighinge without cauſe.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:6393:48"/>
Sometimes he was ſadde, and in a muſe, ſtreightway, as though he knewe his owne faulte, and woulde correcte him ſelfe, he would be merie: to be ſhorte, he changed his countenaunce a thouſande waies. For the minde as wel<note place="margin">Dronken men and Louers in a maner like.</note> of a louer, as of a dronken man is flexible, and can tarie in no certaine ſtate, as though they bothe ſwimmed in a moiſte affection. And for that cauſe a Louer wil ſoone be dronke, and a dronken man ſoone in Loue. Afterward by his ſorowfull gapinge, and careful countenance, al thoſe who were there, ſawe that he was not well. So <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles</hi> alſo perceiuinge that, ſaide to me ſoftely. What meaneth this varietie? Some enuious eie hath looked vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him alſo. Me thinketh that <hi>Cariclia,</hi> and he, haue one diſeaſe: They haue one, &amp; the ſame in déede, by <hi>Iſis</hi> ſaid I, and not without cauſe, in as muche as in this royaltie nexte to her, he was the fayreſt perſon. Thus talked we. But after the cuppes ſhould goo about, <hi>Theagenes</hi> dranke to euery man, although againſte his will, for courteſies ſake. When he came to me, I ſaide, that I thanked him for his gentel proferre, but dranke not. Thinkinge that I had deſpiſed him, he looked vpon me angerly, and with burninge eies. Whiche aſſoone as <hi>Caricles</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, he ſaide, this man drinketh no wine, nor eateth of the fleaſhe of any liuinge thinge. He aſked, why? He is,<note place="margin">Iſis Prieſles drinke no wine, neither eate they the fleaſhe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny liuing thing.</note> ꝙ he, an <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> borne at <hi>Memphis,</hi> and <hi>Iſis</hi> Prieſte. When <hi>Theagenes</hi> perceiued that I was an <hi>Aegyptian,</hi> and a Prieſte, he conceiued a woonderfull pleaſure, and ſtretched him ſelfe for ioye, as thoſe, who haue founde ſome greate treaſure, and called for water, and after he had dronke a good draught, he ſaide, Right wiſe man, I haue dronke to you of that whiche you like beſte, and I praie you, let this table make a laſting league of Amitie betwéene vs. Let it doo ſo woorthy <hi>Theageanes,</hi> ꝙ I, for I haue a good while deſired the ſame, and ſo receiuinge it at his hande, did drinke, and with ſuche talke wée made an ende of the banquet, and went euery one to his owne

lodgynge. But Theagenes imbraced me very louingly, and with diuerſe kiſſes, bothe oftener, and more fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarely then our former acquaintance ſuffered. After I came home, I ſleapte not the firſte parte of the nighte, thinkinge diuerſly of the yonge couple, and diligently ſtudied, what the later ende of the Oracle ſhould meane.<note place="margin">Apollo and Diana, ſente to deliuer Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclia, to Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiris in his dreame.</note> When it was midnight, I ſawe <hi>Apollo,</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> as I thought (if I thought, and it was not rather ſo in déede) and he deliuered <hi>Theagenes</hi> to me, and ſhée <hi>Cariclia,</hi> and callinge me by my name, it is time, ſaide they, that you retourne into your Countrie, for ſo the Ladies of deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, commaunde you. Goo therefore hence thy ſelfe, and take theſe with thée, and loue them as thine owne Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and bringe them out of <hi>Egypte,</hi> whether, and howe it ſhall pleaſe the Goddes. When they had ſaide thus, they wente away, and gaue a token, that it was not a dreame whiche I ſawe, but a thinge donne in déede. I vnderſtoode all the reſte as I had ſéene it, but into what Countrie, or to what people thei ſhould be caried, I could not tell. You wil tell me hereafter Father (ꝙ <hi>Cnemon</hi>) if you know your ſelfe, but howe ſaide you, the Goddes were ſhewed to you, not in your ſleape, but manifeſtly appeared?

So although the rude, and prophane people knowe them not, yet can they not eſcape a wiſe man, but he will know them, either by their eies, in that they looke ſtedfaſtly, and neuer ſhutte their eie liddes, but beſte by their gate, in that they moue not their feete, neither ſette one foote before an other, but are caried with violence of the ayre, rather ſlidinge through, then ſtridinge ouer the windes. Wherefore<note place="margin">Howe the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians make the images of their Goddes.</note> the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> make the Images of the Goddes, with their féete ioyned togeather and not ſeperable aſonder.

And of <hi>Neptune</hi> thus:

As though he ſwimmed in his gate, for thus muſte you take it, by goinge eaſily, not as ſome beinge deceiued, haue thought eaſily I knewe.

<pb facs="tcp:6393:52"/>
Mercury as is falſely fained. His Father was ſuppoſed to be a Prieſte, becauſe as he celebrated certaine Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices in the Temple with his wife, who by chaunce ſlepte there, the God laie with her, and ingendred Homer, who had aboute him a token of vnlawfull generation, for on bothe his thighes there grewe from his byrthe a greate deale of heare. Wherof as he traueled, as wel in Greece, as in other Countries, and made his Poeme, he gained his name. He him ſelfe neither woulde tell his name, nor his Countrie, nor kinred: therefore thoſe, who knewe that qualitie of his bodie, gaue him a name thereof. To what ende, Father ſaide Cnemon, would he not tell his<note place="margin">VVhy Homer concealed his Countrie.</note> Countrie? Either (ꝙ he) becauſe he was aſhamed of his baniſhmente, for he was driuen out of his Countrie by his Father, at what time, hauinge paſſed the age of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tene yéeres, he ſhould haue ben numbred amonge thoſe, that were conſecrated, for that by the marke on his body, he was knowen to be a baſtarde, or els for policie, that while he concealed his owne Countrie, he might lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaie, that he was borne euery where. You ſéeme to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſe theſe thinges very well and wiſely, ſaide Cnemon, gatheringe your coniecture of his Verſe, whiche is ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with all pleaſure, and delectation, righte Egypt like, whiche no doubte ſhoulde not ſo farre haue paſſed all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, if he had not had ſome heauenly foundation. But after (as Homer did) you perceiued that thei were Gods, tel me, Calafiris, what folowed. Surely, Cnemon, ſuche thinges as wente before, I ſlepte little, deuiſed muche, and fell into ſuche cogitations, as liketh the night well. I was very gladde in hope to finde ſuche thinges as I thought vpon, and alſo looked for returne into my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie. Yet was I ſorowfull that Caricles ſhoulde looſe his Daughter. I bethought me, howe I mighte carrie the yonge folkes with me, and ſome meanes was to be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed howe to gette awaie. Then was I troubled as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinge our flight, howe wée might doo that priuely, and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:6393:52"/>
whether wée ſhould directe it, whither by Sea, or Lande. While I laie thus, a thouſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d thoughts aroſe in my head, and I ſlepte no more that night. And it was ſcante daie, when one knocked at my doore, and I hearde a boye call, my man aſked who called, and what he woulde haue? who anſweared, that Theagenes y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Theſſalian was there. I was gladde of thoſe tidinges, and badde him be called in, thinkinge that this beginninge did profer it ſelfe, that I might learne, how to bringe to paſſe, that whiche I was aboute.

Nowe, hauing gotten good occaſion, I began to playe my Pagent, as if I had benne on a ſtage, and burned Frankenſenſe, &amp; mumbled with my lippes, and layde Lawrell on her, from toppe to toe, &amp; at length when I had drowſily, or olde wiſelike gaped, and plaide the foole a greate while with my ſelfe, and the Mayde, I made an ende. Shée, while I was thus dooinge, wagged her heade ofte, and ſmiled, and tolde me, that I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, and knew not her gréefe.

Then <hi>Caricles</hi> mette me, and haue you any good newes to tell me, quoth he? All ſhalbe wel, ſaide I, for to morow ſhée ſhalbe healed of her infirmitie. When I had ſayde thus, I made haſte to be gonne, that he might aſke me no moe queſtions. After I was gonne a litle from the houſe, I ſpyed <hi>Theagenes</hi> walkinge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Church, and the Cloyſters, reaſoning with him ſelfe, as though he had yenough, if he ſawe but <hi>Cariclias</hi>

He ſawe me, &amp; ſayde, God ſpéede you, &amp; tarrie I praie you, for I waited for you. I turned ſuddainly aboute, &amp; ſayd, is this bewtiful <hi>Theagenes,</hi> ſurely, I ſawe him not. How is he bewtifull, ſaide he, that doothe not pleaſe Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclia?
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:6393:55"/>
I ſette a face on it, as if I had benne angrie, and ſaide, will not you leaue to ſpeake euill of me and my ſkill, by whiche ſhée is intrapped and conſtrained to loue you, and dothe deſire to ſée you, as one that is better then her ſelfe. What ſaie you Father, ſaide he? Dothe <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclia</hi> deſire to ſée me? why doo you not then carrie me to her? and therewith he ranne foorth. But I caught him by the clocke, and ſaide, ſtande ſtill here, although you be very light footed, for you muſte not handle this matter as if it were a praye, or eaſie for euery man that liſte to gette the ſame? But it muſt be donne with great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and performed with no ſmall prouiſion.

Wée ſhall not preuaile, ſaide I, not becauſe he can finde any faulte in you, but for that he hath promiſed her, in Mariage to his Siſters Sonne. He ſhall repent it, ſaide he, who ſo euer he be, for while I liue, there ſhall no other wedde <hi>Cariclia,</hi> this hande of mine is not yet ſo benummed, neither my ſwoorde ſo blunte. Be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente, ſaide I, wée ſhall haue no néede of any of theſe thinges, be onely ruled by me, and doo as I commaunde you, for this time departe, and take héede you be not ſpied to talke with me ofte, but when you come, come priuely, and alone: He wente his waie very ſadde. <hi>Caricles</hi> mette me the nexte daie, and aſſoone as he ſawe me, he ranne to me and kiſſed my head oftentimes, continually criynge of ſuche force is your wiſedome, ſuche is our Fréendſhip. Thou haſte brought a great buſineſſe to paſſe, ſhée is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken now, that was harde to be wonne, and ſhée that was before inuincible is nowe ſubdued: <hi>Cariclia</hi> is in Loue.

But tel me, <hi>Caricles,</hi> how you perceiued that ſhée was in loue? When I had gotten very truſty Phiſitions, as you gaue<note place="margin">Howe Caricles perceiued. that Cariclia was in loue.</note> me Counſell, I brought them to her, and promiſed them all the ritches I had, if they coulde cure her.

You muſt, <hi>Caricles,</hi> if it be poſſible, finde her out a man: and when he had ſaide thus, he departed. I come in haſte to you my Sauiour and God, whom both I and ſhée doo acknowledge, to be onely hable to doo vs a good turne. For when I deſired her ofte, and diuerſe waies beſought her, to tell me what ſhée ailed, ſhée made me this anſweare, that ſhée knewe not what diſeaſe ſhée had, mary ſhée knew that none could healpe her, but <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſiris,</hi> and therefore, ſhée deſired me to call you to her. Whereby I chiefely gheaſſed, that your wiſedome had brought her vnder: Can you (ſaide I to him) tell as well whome ſhée loueth, as that ſhée is in Loue? No by <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> ſaide he. For how, or by what meanes ſhould I know that. Mary I woulde aboue all thinges, that ſhée loued <hi>Alcamenes,</hi> my Siſters Sonne, whom, as muche as lieth in me, I haue appointed to be her Huſbande. You maie (ſaide I) trie and bring him in, and ſhewe him to her. He liked my Counſell well, and wente his waie.

Wée wente from her in leſſe while then ſhée ſpake the woordes, for what ſhoulde wée doo, ſeinge ſo fearefull a ſighte?

<pb facs="tcp:6393:57"/>
O <hi>Caricles,</hi> ſaide I, you ſaide truely that your Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was madde: for ſhée is moued with the multitude, that I haue burdened her with, whiche are not of the leaſt, but ſuche as ſhould force her to doo, that whiche ſhée abhorred, as well by nature, as determination of minde. But I ſuppoſe that ſome God taketh an him to hinder this buſineſſe, and to ſtriue with my miniſters. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is time that you ſhewe me her ſafetie, whiche you ſaide, was founde with her, with the other Iewels. I am afraide, leaſte that be inchanted, and wrought with ſuch thinges, as doo nowe exaſperate her minde, by reaſon, that ſomme Enimie had ordeined this for her as ſoone as ſhée was borne, that ſhée ſhoulde be eſtraunged from all loue, and die without Iſſue. He allowed, that I ſaide, &amp; within a while after, he brought me the ſame, wherein were <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Letters, not common, but ſuche as the Princes vſe, whiche are like the Letters that the <hi>Aegy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians</hi> vſe in theire Holy affaires, as I readde it ouer, I founde ſuche thinges written therein. <hi>Perſina,</hi> Quéene<note place="margin">The contentes of Cariclias faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, whiche de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth who are her Parentes, and the cauſe of her expoſition.</note> of the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> to her Daughter onely, in ſorrowe, by what name ſo euer ſhée ſhalbe called, doothe write in haſte this Lamentation conteined herein, as her laſte gifte. I was aſtonied, <hi>Cnemon,</hi> when I hearde <hi>Perſinas</hi> name: yet I readde that whiche folowed, whiche was thus: My Daughter, the Sunne beinge Authoure of our ſtocke, is witneſſe, that for no miſdéede, I haue caſte thée foorthe, and concealed thée from thy Father <hi>Hydaſpes</hi> ſighte: yet my Daughter, I would haue my ſelfe excuſed to thée, if thou happen to liue, and to him, who ſhal finde thée, if God procure any, and to al menne, and therefore I declare the cauſe of thy Expoſition.

And tellinge my Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band that thou werte ſtraight dead, I haue priuely laide thée forthe, with the greateſt Kitches that I had, for a rewarde to him that ſhall finde thée, and take thée vp. And beſides that, I haue furniſhed thée with other thinges, I haue wrapped thée in this blankette, wherein is conteined the ſumme of bothe our Eſtates, whiche I haue written with teares, and bloude that I haue ſhedde for thée, by reaſon that I bare thée, and fell into muche ſorrowe for thée, at one and the ſame time.

Theſe thinges haue I ſaide to thée, inuentinge my writinge to this vſe, ſithe that God had taken from me the Habilitie to tell thée them to thy face, whiche as they maie be voide of no effecte with litle laboure, ſo may they be profitable hereafter.

After I had redde this, <hi>Cnemon,</hi> I knewe what ſhée was, and marueiled greatly at the gouernance of the Goddes, and was full of pleaſure and ſorrowe, and altogeather newely affected, wéepinge and laughinge at ones, my minde nowe became gladde for the knowinge of that whereof I was ignorant before, and for remembringe that whiche was anſweared by the Oracle, but very muche troubled for that which was to come, and had greate pitie and compaſſion of the life<note place="margin">Mans Life vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable.</note> of man, as a thinge very vnſtable and weake, and ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge euery waie, whiche I knewe them firſte by the happe of <hi>Cariclia.</hi> For I thought of many thinges, of what Parentes ſhée was come, whoſe Childe ſhée was thought to be, howe farre ſhée was from her Countrie, and was now called Daughter by a falſe name, whereas ſhée had loſte her naturall Countrie ſoyle, and royall bloude of <hi>Aethiopia.</hi> To make fewe woordes, I was a greate while in ſtudie, for that I had good cauſe to haue pitie, and bewaile her ſtate paſſed, and yet durſt not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mende
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:6393:58"/>
that whiche was to come, vntill pluckinge vp my harte, I concluded, that nowe it was not good to delaie the matter, but with ſpéede to execute that I had begone. And when I came to <hi>Cariclia,</hi> I founde her alone, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geather weried with loue, and ſtriuinge to withſtande her fancie. Mary her body was muche afflicted, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that it yéelded to her infirmitie, and ſhée was not hable with any force to withſtande the violence thereof. After I had then farre put them awaie, who were with her, and gaue them charge that they ſhoulde make no noyſe, in maner as if I had made ſome Prayers and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocations aboute the Mayde, I ſaide to her. Now is the time come <hi>Cariclia,</hi> (for ſo you promiſed yeſterdaie) to tell me your griefe, &amp; not to conceale it any longer from a man that loueth you hartely, and alſo can knowe it though you holde your tongue: ſhée tooke me by the hand and kiſſed it, and therewithal ſhée wepte.

With that I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted her, and ſaide.

After I had ſaide thus, <hi>Cnemon,</hi> ſhée was in a great ſwelte, and it was euident that ſhée was gladde of that ſhée hearde, and greately in feare, and muche troubled for that ſhée hoped: at length ſhée waxed redde, to thinke in what ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſhée was taken. After ſhée had ſtayed a while: Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſaide ſhée, you doo tell me of Mariage, and bidde me imbrace that, as thought it were plaine that either my Father woulde be contente therewith, or mine enemy, ſéeke that. As for the yonge man, ſaide I, it is out of doubte. For he is more in Loue then you, beinge moued with like meanes ſo to doo, by reaſon that bothe your mindes (as is like) at the firſte ſight knewe others excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencie, and fell into like affection, and I my ſelfe haue made his Loue the more, to doo you a pleaſure. But he that is ſuppoſed to be your Father, prouideth you an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Huſbande, <hi>Alcamenes</hi> whome you knowe well ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Lette him (ꝙ ſhée) rather ſéeke to late him in his graue, then Marry him to me. Either <hi>Theagenes</hi> ſhall<note place="margin">Cariclia wil haue Theagenes or none.</note> haue me, or that whiche is deſtinied to all men ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue me. But I prayeyou, tell me how you knowe that <hi>Caricles</hi> is not my Father in déede, but ſuppoſed ſo to be. By this faſcia (ſaide I) and therewithal I ſhewed it her: Where had you that, or howe came you by it, ſaide ſhée? for after he had receiued me in <hi>Egypte,</hi> of him who brought me vp, he brought me hither I knowe not, how, and tooke that from me, and keapte it in a Cheſte, that by

continuance of time it might not be ſpoyled. Howe I came by it (ſaide I) you ſhall heare afterwarde. But tell me preſently, if you can tel, what is contayned therein: when ſhée tolde me that ſhée coulde not tell, it declareth (ſaide I) your Parentes, your Countrie, and all your Fortune. At laſte for that ſhée requeſted, that I woulde tell her what I knewe, I tolde her al, readinge it woorde by woorde, and interpretinge it to her. After ſhée knewe her ſelfe, and had taken ſtomake vnto her, ſhée drewe more neare her owne Petigrée, and ſaide, what muſte wée doo? Then beganne I to tell her plainely all our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, and made her priuie to euery pointe. I, my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter (ſaide I) haue gonne into <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> to learne ſome of theie wiſedome, and was well acquainted with <hi>Perſina.</hi>

After ſhée vnderſtoode that I woulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne into my Countrie, ſhée tolde me all your affayres, bindinge me by Othe firſte, to kéepe it ſecrete, and ſayde moreouer that ſhée durſte not tell it to the Wiſe men of that Countrie, and ſhée deſired me to aſke the Goddes, firſte whether after your expoſition, you liued: then in what Countrie you were. For ſhée coulde heare of none ſuche in <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> although ſhée had made thereof dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent inquirie.

Shée made promiſe ſo to doo: and I wente my waie, and leafte her wéepinge. I ſcantly was gone out of her Chamber, but I ſawe <hi>Caricles,</hi> very ſadde, and ful of ſorrowe. Ah good Sir (ſaide I) when you ſhoulde folowe me, and reioice, and doo Sacrifice of thankeſge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing to the Goddes, for that you haue gotten, that which before you deſired, <hi>Cariclia,</hi> at length by muche ſkil, and manifolde wiſedome, made content to take a Huſbande, then are you ſadde, and heauie, and can ſcante refraine from teares, but I knowe not why. Why ſhoulde I not (ſaide he)? ſéeinge it ſhal come to paſſe, that the thinges, whiche I holde deareſt in my life, ſhal be carried into ſomme other Countrie, if we maie geue credite, as wel to the Dreame that I had this nighte, as to others, wherein, me thought, that an Egle, let flie out of <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loes</hi>

Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Caricles,</hi> let vs be mery, and addicte our ſelues to the wil of the Goddes, labouringe euery waie the better to perſuade the Maide. He aſked me what was beſte to be donne, that the Maide mighte be more obediente. If (ꝙ I) you haue any pretious thinge in ſtoare, or apparell wrought with Golde, or any Iewel of price, bringe them to her, as Tokens from her Spouſe, &amp; appeaſe her with giftes: For Gold, &amp; Pretious Stoanes are woonderfully eſtéemed with woomen.

After <hi>Caricles</hi> had ſaide, thinke that I wil omit nothinge whiche I can doo, he wente home, and for ioie, as ſoone as I had leafte talkinge with him, he made haſte<note place="margin">Caricles geueth Cariclia al the Iewelles that her Mother gaue her at the time of her Expoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> ſo to doo. And he did in déede, as I perceiued afterward, that whiche I commaunded him, without delaie, in brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginge, as wel the coſtly Garmente, as alſo the Iewesl of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> which <hi>Perſina</hi> laide foorthe with <hi>Cariclia,</hi> that ſhée mighte knowe what ſhée was, as thoughe they had benne Tokens from <hi>Alcamenes.</hi> Then mette I with <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and aſked him where thoſe were, who were the Dooers of the Roialtie aforſaide. The Maides (quoth he) are gonne awaie before, that thei maie take the eaſier iournies: and the yonge menne wil tarry no longer, but make much adoo, and greate prouiſion to returne to their Conntrie. When I knewe this, I tolde him what he ſhould both ſaie to them, and doo him ſelfe, and gaue him charge, that he ſhould waite vntil I gaue him a Token, what he ſhoulde doo. And ſo I leafte him, and wente to the Temple of <hi>Apollo,</hi> to praie the God, that he woulde inſtructe me as concerninge my flighte with the yonge<note place="margin">God is ready to helpe thoſe that woorke by his will.</note> couple. But the God was quicker then any man would thinke, who helpeth thoſe that doo their buſineſſe, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to his wil, although he be not called vpon, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:6393:61"/>
preuentinge theire praiers with the readineſſe of his good wil: as euen then it happened, that he preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my queſtion with the anſweare, and did in déede de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his helpe, and pleaſure. For as much as a certaine voice ſtaied me as I wente by, to a Propheteſſe, and was very careful for the perfourmance of that I determined: whiche ſaide, you maie make haſte when the ſtrangers calle you, who at that time, with the noyſe of Shames, made a Banquette in the honoure of <hi>Hercules.</hi> I wente not ſo faſte after I hearde this, for I might not goe paſte when God had called me. After I had with Franken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence perfumed, &amp; offered water, they ſéemed to woonder at the coſte of my Oblations: yet for al that, they deſired me to take parte of theire Banquette. I did ſo, &amp; after I ſate downe on a Benche whiche they had ſtrewed with <hi>Myrte,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lawrel</hi> for ſtrangers, and had eaten ſuch meate as I was accuſtomed to doo, I ſaid vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, good felowes, I thanke you for my goo chéere. But I am vtterly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rante of your Demeanour: wherefore it is time that ye tel me, what ye are, and whence ye comme. For it is an vnſéemely, and very rude thinge, that thoſe, who haue donne Sacrifice, and Banquetted togeather, and made holy meate at the beginninge of their friendeſhip, ſhould departe without either knowinge others affaires. Then they tolde me, that they were Merchauntes of <hi>Tyros</hi> in <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> and that they ſailed to <hi>Carthage</hi> in <hi>Aphrique,</hi> with a Shippe fraughted with Merchandyſe of <hi>India, Aethiopia,</hi> and <hi>Phoenicia:</hi> At this time we make a Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quette<note place="margin">The Tyrians do Sacrifice to Hercules, for a victory that one of their compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions had.</note> to <hi>Hercules</hi> of <hi>Tyros,</hi> for a Victorie which we haue gotten, in as muche as this yonge man, pointing to him that ſate before me, gotte the beſte game at Wraſtlinge: whereby he hathe proued, that a <hi>Tyrian</hi> maie gette the Victorie in the middeſt of the <hi>Greekes.</hi> For he, after wée had ſayled paſte <hi>Malea,</hi> and by force of Tempeſte were conſtrained to lande at the Ilande of the people of <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalem,</hi> ſware vnto vs by this our Countrie God, that

For wée commonly ſayle by night, for that the windes that come then from the earthe, doo calmely fill our ſayles. I made bargayne that I woulde doo ſo, bindinge them firſte by Othe, that they ſhould not departe before their promiſed time was expired. And ſo I lefte them there, yet pipinge and dauncinge, after the manner of the <hi>Aſſyrans,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time leapinge alofte, ſometime bendinge their bodyes downewarde, and like ſuche as were inſpired with ſome God, writhinge them ſelues. Then wente I to <hi>Cariclia,</hi> and founde her holdinge in her lappe the Iewels whiche <hi>Caricles</hi> gaue her, and earneſtly vewed them.

men came to the houſe of <hi>Cariclia,</hi> the Captayne of this amorous warre was <hi>Theagenes,</hi> who taught his youthes after their braue Pompe to plaie the Souldiers. They ſuddainely made thoſe afrayde, which perceiued a little, with their greate clamour &amp; claſſhynge of their armour, ſo that with greate lighte they brake into her houſe, lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge the doore aſide eaſily, for that it was prouided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it ſhoulde not be very harde barred, and tooke her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie wel prepared, for that ſhée knew hereof before, and with good will ſuffered this aſſaulte, and caried a greate deale of ſtuffe ſuche as the Mayde commaunded them, away alſo. After they came out of the houſe, they ſoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded a warlike crie, and made a terrible noyſe with their Harneſſe, and ſo paſſed through the Cittie, and caſte the Inhabitantes thereof into a woonderful feare, by reaſon that they had choſen the night for none other pourpoſe, but that they might be the more feared. So that <hi>Pernaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> gaue an <hi>Eccho</hi> backe to their noyſe. After they were gone out of the Cittie, as faſte as they coulde, they hied them on Horſebacke into the Mountaines of <hi>Locrus</hi> and <hi>Oeta.</hi> But <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Cariclia,</hi> as was before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, foreſooke the <hi>Theſſalians,</hi> and came to me priuily, and fell bothe in greate feare at my féete, and ſtill cried, ſaue vs Father. <hi>Cariclia</hi> ſaide no more, but helde downe her heade, as though ſhée were aſhamed of that ſhée had donne. But <hi>Theagenes</hi> ſaide more. <hi>Calaſiris</hi> ſaue vs beinge Strangers, and banniſhed our Countries, depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of all our Friendes, that amonge them all wée might winne our ſelues.

I was moued herewith, and after I had wepte, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with my harte, then mine eies, ſo that the yonge folkes perceiued it not, yet it eaſed my griefe, I comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and imboldened them. At a woorde I badde them
<pb facs="tcp:6393:63"/>
hope for a luckie ende, in that this matter was begonne by the will and Counſell of the Goddes. As for me (ꝙ I) I will goo and diſpatche the reſte of our buſineſſe. But tarry you me in this place, and take diligent héede that no man eſpie you. When I had ſaide thus, I went backe, but <hi>Cariclia</hi> caught me by the coate, and helde me faſte,<note place="margin">An example of paſsinge Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitie.</note> and ſayde: What Father, this beginninge is vniuſte or rather Trayterous, if you will departe, and leaue me alone with <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and will not conſider howe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>méete a man, a Louer is to be a kéeper, if that be in his power to enioye whiche he loueth, and wante ſuche as may make him aſhamed thereof. For, I thinke, that he is rather incenſed, when he ſeeth, that which he deſireth, without any defenſe before his face. Wherefore I will not let you departe before, as well for the time preſent, but rather for that whiche is to come: I maie be ſure by <hi>Theagenes</hi> Othe, that he ſhall not fleaſhly haue to doo with me, vntill I haue recouered my Countrie, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentes, or if the Goddes be not content herewith, at leaſt vntill I by mine owne frée will be content he ſhall Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie me. Otherwiſe neuer. After I harde what ſhée had ſaide, I woondered and was determined it ſhould be ſo, and made a little fire vpon an Aultare, and burned In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe. <hi>Theagenes</hi> ſware, ſayinge that he had wronge, for that the faithe which he had determined in his minde to kéepe, was taken away by reaſon of an Othe, and that he coulde not prayſe that will, whiche was forced by a<note place="margin">Theagenes thinketh paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence par force, ſcant woorthy prayſe.</note> greater power, yet for all that he tooke his Othe, by <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi> of <hi>Delphos,</hi> and <hi>Diana,</hi> by <hi>Venus</hi> her ſelfe, and all Lawes, that he woulde doo all thinges in ſuche ſorte, as <hi>Cariclia</hi> would haue him. This and many other thinges they concluded betwéene them ſelues, callinge the Gods witneſſes thereto. I comminge as faſte as I could to <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles,</hi> founde all his houſe on a hurlyburly, and ſory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Miniſters were now come to him, and had tolde him of the takinge awaie of the Mayde, and the Citizens

came by heapes &amp; ſtoode rounde about him, while he ſoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed, at a woorde, what for ignorance of that was done, &amp; wante of counſell for that was to come, they were at their wittes endes. There beganne I with my bigge voyce to thunder, and ſaye: Yée vnhappy people, howe<note place="margin">Calaſiris diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled Oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> longe will ye ſitte ſtill, dombe like ſtockes, as though your courage were alſo taken awaie with ill Fortune? Why doo you not in Armoure purſue your enemies? wil you not take, and puniſhe them, who haue donne you this wronge? It is in vaine perhappes (ſayde <hi>Caricles</hi>) to ſtriue any longer with this preſent Fortune. For I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande perfitely, that I am thus puniſhed for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Goddes, whiche was foreſhewed me, ſince I wente in an vnlucky time, into the priuie Chappell, and ſawe there that whiche was not lawfull to be ſéene, that therefore I ſhould loſe, that I ſette moſte ſtoare by. But there is no impediment (as the Prouerbe is) that ſhoulde let vs to fight with the Goddes, if wée knewe whom to purſue, or him, who hath donne vs this miſchiefe. That is (ſayde I) <hi>Theagenes</hi> the <hi>Theſſalian,</hi> &amp; the yonge men, whiche were with him, whom you prayſed ſo muche, and made my friende. And ſo you maie yet finde ſome man in the Cittie, who hath till this time ſtayed here: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ariſe, &amp; call the people to Councell: ſo was it donne. The Captaines appointed a méetinge, by Trumpet pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clayminge the ſame in the Cittie, the people ſtraight came together, the Theater was made a Courte by night. <hi>Caricles</hi> came foorth, and fallinge ſuddainely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wéepinge, beganne to ſaie thus: Perhappes ye (menne<note place="margin">Caricles piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Oration, aboute the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge away of Cariclia.</note> of <hi>Delphi</hi>) ſuppoſe, conſideringe the greatneſſe of my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries, that I come hither, and haue gathered this multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of people, to vtter mine owne miſhappes vnto you. But it is not ſo: For although I ſuffer ofte ſuch thinges as may be compared with deathe it ſelfe, and at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time my houſe is deſolate, and deſtroyed by the Goddes, ſolitary, and robbed of thoſe that I helde moſte

Excepte theſe <hi>Theſſalian</hi> youthes haue taken awaie our loftie courages, and iuſte wrathe whiche wée ſhoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue for our Countrie, and Countrie Goddes. For, that whiche is moſte intollerable, a fewe dauncinge Boyes, ſente about a Sacred meſſage, doo depart after they haue waſted the moſt Noble Cittie of <hi>Greece,</hi> and haue taken out of <hi>Apolloes</hi> Churche, the moſte Pretious Iewell thereof, <hi>Cariclia,</hi> which alſo was my Life. O implacable and too obſtinate anger of God, towarde vs: Firſte (as you al knowe) it killed my natural Daughter at the daie of her Marriage, and her Mother alſo with the griefe that ſhée tooke for her Deathe, and banniſhed me from my Natiue Countrie. But all this was tollerable after I had founde <hi>Cariclia: Cariclia</hi> was my life, my hope, and ſtaie of my ſtocke: <hi>Cariclia</hi> onely was my comforte, and, as I maie terme her, mine increaſe: whiche alſo this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerie (what ſo euer it be, that nowe came vpon me) hathe taken from me.

But <hi>Cnemon</hi> was muche abaſhed whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he hearde <hi>Thisbes</hi> name, and turned al his cogitations to the time paſte, with muche and continual ſorrowe tormentinge him ſelfe all the reſte of the night, ſo that <hi>Calaſiris</hi> though he were faſte a ſléepe, perceiued it, who ſittinge vp a little, and leaninge on his elbowe, aſked what he lacked, and why he was ſo diſquieted, as if he were almoſte madde. Haue I not good cauſe (ſayde <hi>Cnemon</hi> to him) to be madde, ſeinge I heare that <hi>Thisbe</hi> is aliue. What is this <hi>Thisbe</hi> (ꝙ <hi>Calaſiris</hi>) or how doo you know her, by hearinge her name, and are ſo gréeued that ſhée is aliue? You ſhal heare the reſte (ꝙ <hi>Cnemon</hi>) when I tell you mine eſtate. But her I ſawe ſlaine with theſe eies, and with mine owne handes, I buried her with the Heardmen. Sléepe, ſayde <hi>Calaſiris,</hi> and wée ſhall knowe how this goeth ere longe. I maye not (ꝙ he) but lie you ſtill and ſturre not: For my parte I know not whether I can liue, excepte I goo for the ſecretely, and make dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent inquirie, how <hi>Nauſicles</hi> is deceiued, and howe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> ſuche as were deade, reuiue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. <hi>Calaſiris</hi> ſmiled a little at this, and ſo fell a ſléepe. <hi>Cnemon</hi> wente out of the chamber, and reſtrained him ſelfe muche, as is like one would doo that is in the darke, and in an vnacquainted houſe: but he tooke all in good parte, for feare of <hi>Thisbe,</hi> being deſirous in haſte to ridde him ſelfe out of this doubte: till at lengthe with muche adoo, after he had gonne vp and downe oft in one place, as if he had benne in diuerſe, he hearde a woman like a Nightingale in the Springe, dolefully lamentinge, and with ſorrowfull tunes, ſo that by her mourninge (as if one had taken him by the hande) he was brought to her chamber, and layinge his eare to the doore, hearde her yet

complayninge in this ſorte.

But nowe the God who hath had charge of our buſineſſe from the beginninge, and hath graunted vs but ſmall pleaſure, not yet ſatiſfied, hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued vs againe. I thought that I had eſcaped bondage, but now I ſerue againe, and am kepte in pryſon: I was in an Iland and darke place before, this preſent ſtate is like too it, or rather, to ſaye the trothe, woorſe, becauſe he, who bothe coulde and woulde by comforte abate theſe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, is violently ſeperated &amp; taken from me. A denne of Théeues the daye before was mine Inne, and what was that habitation, but a very Hel, or woorſe place? yet my déere Louer beinge with me, made it eaſie to be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered. There he lamented me aliue, and ſhedde teares for me, beinge (as he thought) dead, and bewayled me as if I had benne ſlaine, nowe am I depriued of all this: he is gonne, who was partaker of my calamities, and who would haue deuided them, as though it had benne a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. And I alone am forſaken, a pryſoner, and by many waies to be lamented, am obiected to the arbiterment of cruell Fortune. And doo reteyne my life onely, for that I hope my moſte déere friende is aliue. But <hi>ô</hi> my harte, where art thou? or what Fortune haſte thou? arte thou alſo alas bounde, whiche haſte a frée minde, not able to abide any ſeruage, but of Loue? well, doo nothinge but ſaue thy life, to the intent thou mayſt once beholde thy <hi>Thisbe</hi> againe: for ſo ſhalte thou call me, whether thou wilt or not. <hi>Cnemon</hi> coulde abide no longer, after he hearde this, too heare the reſte: though he gheaſſed by the beginninge ſomewhat els, yet by that he hearde in the

ende, concludinge that it was <hi>Thisbe,</hi> wanted but litle<note place="margin">The name of Thiſbe, troubleth Cnemon ſore.</note> that he ſounded not at the gate. But after he had ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commed that paſſion with muche adoo, for feare leaſt he ſhould be ſpied of any man (for nowe the Cockes crewe the ſeconde time) he ranne backe ſlumblinge, ſometime hurtinge his toes againſt the ſelles, ſometimes hittinge his head againſt the walles and doore poſtes. When he came to his lodginge after muche trauell, he fell into the bedde, and all his body trembled, and his téeth chattered ſore: and he had perhappes benne in extreame perill, if <hi>Calaſiris,</hi> had not perceiued it, and comforted him, and brought him to him ſelfe againe. After he was reuiued a little, he aſked of him the matter. I am vndonne (ꝙ he) for that moſt wicked <hi>Thisbe</hi> is aliue in déede: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withall he ſounded againe: and <hi>Calaſiris</hi> had much adoo to call him agayne, and comforte him. Surely ſome God plainely ſcorned <hi>Cnemon,</hi> becauſe (as otherwiſe, for the moſt parte it maketh a ieſte, or toie of humaine affayres: ſo nowe it woulde not ſuffer him peaceably without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietneſſe, to enioye that whiche was moſt pleaſant and welcome to him, but that whiche ſhortely after woulde make him very ioyfull, was nowe turned into ſorrowe) either for that it ſhewed then the nature, and cuſtome of it ſelfe, or els becauſe the Nature of man can not take true ioye as ſhould be. Wherefore <hi>Cnemon</hi> ſtedde from that, whiche he then ſhould moſte haue deſired, &amp; ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that to be fearefull, whiche was moſte delectable to him. For the woman that wepte was not <hi>Thisbe,</hi> but <hi>Cariclia.</hi> For thus it was: after <hi>Thiamis</hi> came into his Enimies hande aliue, and was kepte Pryſoner, the Ilande was ſette on fire, and the Heardemen, who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited it, were fledde, <hi>Cnemon,</hi> and <hi>Thermutis, Thia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> Shielde Bearer, in the morninge rewed ouer the Lake, to ſpie in what caſe theire Captaine was with their Enimies: the manner of their iourney was ſuch as is declared before. Then were <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and <hi>Cariclia</hi>
                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:6393:67"/>
leafte in the Denne alone, who accoumpted the prolon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginge of their calamities a ſingulare benefite, that was the firſte time that euer they were by them ſelues, and deliuered from al that mighte trouble them. Wherefore they conſidered of theire eſtate, not forgettinge to kiſſe and imbrace eche other, ſo that they foregat all that they had to doo, &amp; ſtoode either in others armes a greate while, as if they had benne made one Body, contente yet to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfie them ſelues with Chaſte Loue, temperatinge their affection with teares, and clenly kiſſes. For <hi>Cariclia,</hi> if at any time ſhée perceiued <hi>Theagenes</hi> to paſſe the boundes of ſéemelineſſe, and deale with her ouer want only, would rebuke him by tellinge him of his Othe: and he woulde ſuffer him ſelfe to be refourmed with litle laboure, and brought againe to temperateneſſe, in as much as he was<note place="margin">Cariclia more in Loue, then Theagenes.</note> in Loue inferiour to her, but in pleaſure he far ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But at length, though it were longe firſte, thei re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred what they had to doo, and by force were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to contente them ſelues, and then <hi>Theagenes</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to ſpeake thus: That we, <hi>Cariclia,</hi> maie enioie one an other, and attaine vnto that, whiche we haue prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red before al other thinges, and for whiche we haue ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined al our troubles, bothe wée doo wiſhe, &amp; the Goddes of <hi>Greece</hi> graunte.

                  <pb facs="tcp:6393:68"/>
praiſed his diuiſe, and they agreed, if they were ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that <hi>Theagenes</hi> ſhoulde write, <hi>Pithicus: Cariclia, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies</hi> vpon al famous Churches, Pictures, Monumentes, and greate Stoanes in Croſſe waies, whether they were gonne the right hande waie, or the lefte: to what Cittie, Village, or Countrie: and laſtely, that thei ſhould declare the very daie, and houre. And if they might, it ſhoulde be ſufficiente one to ſée the other. For they thoughte no time ſhoulde be hable to put out of theire mindes ſuche Loue: yet for the better aſſurance, <hi>Cariclia</hi> woulde ſhewe her Fathers Kinge, whiche was laide out with her, and <hi>Theagenes</hi> a Scarre in his Thighe, that a wilde Bore gaue him. It was further concluded betwéene them, that in ſtéede of woordes, ſhée ſhoulde beare a Taper, and he a Branche of Palme. To confirme this, they imbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced eche other, and wepte, powringe out their teares in ſtéede of Sacrifice (as I gheaſſe), and for an Othe, they vſed many kiſſes. After theſe thinges were thus orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, they came out af the Caue, without touching any of the Treaſures whiche were laied vp there. For they coumpted thoſe goodes vncleane, whiche were gotten by Robberies: but that which they brought with them from <hi>Delphi,</hi> and that the Théeues had taken from them, that they gathered togeather, and carried with them: And <hi>Cariclia</hi> chaunged her Apparaile, and put it into a litle Packe with the Coppie of their Vowe, and her Garland, and Sacred Garmente: and that it might be more priuie, they laied the reſte of their woorſte ſtuffe vpon it. As for her Bowe, and Quiuer, ſhée gaue them to <hi>Theagenes</hi> to beare, whiche was a paſſinge pleaſante burthen to him, ſéeinge they were the proper Weapons of the God, who had the power ouer him. As ſoone as they came neare to the Lake, and were aboute to take Boate, they ſpied a bande of Armed men rowinge ouer to the Ilande. They<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abaſſhed at that terrible ſighte, ſtoode a great while aſtonied, as though with the greatneſſe of their ſorrowe

But <hi>Theagenes</hi> cauſed her to abide, and ſaide how longe ſhal wée flée the fate that foloweth vs euery where? Let vs yéelde to Fortune, and withſtande no longer the viole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce which is ready to aſſaulte vs, for what els ſhal we gaine, but fruiteleſſe trauell, and a baniſhed life, and from time to time, be ſcorned of the Goddes? Doo you not ſee howe they ioine the Robberies of the Pyrates to our baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and goe aboute with greate diligence and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell to bringe vs into greater daungers, by Lande, then earſt wée haue founde by Sea? not longe agoo they made afraie aboute vs: within a little after, they broughte Théeues vnto vs, ere while thei made vs priſoners, then lefte they vs alone, but at libertie, and made vs beléeue wée might goo whither wée woulde, then ſtreight haue they brought vs into the handes of ſuche as ſhall kill vs. This warre for their diſporte haue thei made againſt vs, making as it were, a Comedie of our affayres. Why then doo not wée breake of this Tragical Poeme of theirs, and yéelde vs to thoſe that wil kill vs? leaſt perhappes if they meane to make an intollerable ende of our Tragedy, we be forced to kill our ſelues. <hi>Cariclia</hi> allowed not al that he ſaide, mary ſhée thought that he iuſtly accuſed For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, but not that it was any pointe of wiſedome, to yéelde them ſelues willingly into their enimies handes, for they were not ſure that they would kil them as ſoone as they had them, neither had they to doo with ſo gentle and friendly a God, that woulde make a quicke ende of their miſeries, but woulde perhappes reſerue them to a further bondage. Which thinge, then what death ſhould it not be more gréeuous? If wée geue our ſelues to the

After <hi>Theagenes</hi> had ſaide, Let vs doo as you wil: ſhée wente before, and he fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her, as if he had benne tied to her. Yet for al their haſte, they came not to the Denne before their Enimies: but while they looked on them that wente before them, they wiſte not that with an other bande whiche came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ilande at an other place, they were compaſſed, and encloſed.

One of thoſe, who were landed, wente aboute to ſhoote at them, but after the yonge folkes had looked vpon them, theire hartes failed, &amp; their righte handes quaked. For the very<note place="margin">The propertie of bewtifull perſonages.</note> barbarous handes (as may appeare) doo feare the bewtiful perſonages, and a right cruell eye will be made gentell with a lowly looke. As ſoone as thei had taken them. they carried them to the Captayne, greatly deſiringe to carry the fayreſt of the ſpoiles to him at the firſt: &amp; thei brought nothinge els, for although they had compaſſed the Iland with their Armoure, as with a nette rounde aboute, and had ſearched it from one parte to another, yet could they finde nothinge, for all that was in the Ilande, was bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the former ſkirmiſhe, ſauinge the Denne onely whiche no man knewe.

But <hi>Cariclia</hi> wente with <hi>Nauſicles</hi> Daughter, and other woomen whiche comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her diuerſly, but had muche adoo to perſwade her to goe with them: and I know not, whether euer ſhée would haue ben perſwaded, if vnder pretence of the Sacrifice, ſhée had not determined to praie for <hi>Theagenes.</hi> After they came to <hi>Mercuries</hi> Temple (for <hi>Nauſicles</hi> made his<note place="margin">Mercurie the God of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntes.</note> Sacrifice to him, as the God that had moſte care of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntes, and honoured him more then the reſte) and the Offeringe was begonne, <hi>Calaſiris</hi> looked a litle vpon the Intrailes, and by the diuerſe chaunges of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, declared the pleaſure, and paines of that whiche was to comme.

And therewith he deliuered him a Princely Ringe, a paſſinge Heauenly thinge: as touchinge the Hoope, it was of Iuory, wherein was ſet a bright <hi>Amethyſt of Aethiopia,</hi> as greate as a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:6393:71"/>
Maydens eie, in bewtte farre better, then thoſe of Iberia, or <hi>Britayne.</hi> For thoſe haue but an ill colour, which ſhine not at all, but are like to the Roſe budde at the firſte, whiche after with the heate of the Sunne waxe perfite redde. But the <hi>Ethiopian Amethyſt,</hi> hath a perfect Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent colour, &amp; ſhineth through out, and if you turne him aboute, as you holde him, he caſteth foorthe a Golden beame, whiche dothe not hurte or dimme the ſighte, but maketh it muche better and clearer, and he hath a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vertue, more then the Weſterne ſtoanes: for it hath not his name without effecte, but will not lette him be dronke in déede, that weareth him, but kepeth him fober at all feaſtes: and of this qualitie is euery <hi>Amethyſt,</hi> of <hi>India,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia.</hi> But that ſtoane whiche <hi>Calaſiris</hi> gaue <hi>Nauſicles,</hi> did paſſe theſe farre: For there was a Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture grauen in it, repreſentinge certaine beaſtes, which was donne in this ſorte. A boye ſittinge not vpon a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hie Hill to looke aboute him, kepte Shéepe, appointing his flocke their ſeuerall paſtures with his pipe, they ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to be ruled, and tarry at their féedinge, accordingly as he ſounded his inſtrument. A man would haue ſaide that thei had Golden fléeſes, not by reaſon of the woorke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, but for that the <hi>Amethyſt</hi> ſhyninge with his redneſſe vpon their backes, made them ſhewe ſo fayre. There were grauen yonge Lambes leapinge vp and downe, and ſome by heapes wente vp the Rocke, other ſome daunced rounde aboute the Shéepherde, ſo that the toppe of the Rocke was made a Shepeherdes diſporte. Other ſkipped in the flame of the <hi>Amethyſt,</hi> as if thei had benne in the Sunne, who with the tippes of their féete, ſcraped the ſtoane. Many of the yonger forte beinge of greater courage, ſéemed as though they woulde goe out of the compaſſe, but were letted by the woorkemanſhip, whiche ſet a pale of Golde in manner of a wall, aboute the Rocke and them, and it was a Rocke in déede and not a counterfeite, for when the woorkeman had wrought
<pb facs="tcp:6393:72"/>
the Golde aboute the outer parte of the Stoane for that pourpoſe, he ſhewed that very liuely whiche he deſired, thinkinge it to no pourpoſe, to counterfeite one Stoane in an other. Suche a one was the Ringe. <hi>Nauſicles,</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the ſtraungeneſſe of the thinge, but more with the value thereof: eſtéeminge the Ringe of more price, then al the goodes he had beſide, ſpake thus: Good <hi>Calaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> I did but ieſte: and where I aſked ſomewhat for the Ranſome of your Daughter, it was but woordes: for I determined to let you haue her for nothinge. But for<note place="margin">The giftes of the Goddes ought not to be refuſed.</note> as muche as the giftes of the Goddes are not to be refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (as you ſaie), I take this Stoane ſente from Heauen, perſwadinge my ſelfe, that this was ſente from the God that is moſte beneficial to me, according as he is woonte, and hathe geuen this to you, through fire, as maie yet be ſéene by the flaminge thereof. Otherwiſe I déeme that<note place="margin">VVhat gaine is beſte.</note> vantage to be beſte, which without damage of the geuer, doothe enriche him that receiueth it. After he had ſaide this, and made an ende of the Offeringe, he wente to méete with the reſte, placing the woomen by them ſelues in an inner parte of the Temple, and the menne in the porche. After they had eaten yenough, and the Cuppes were ſette on the Table, the menne called vpon <hi>Bacchus</hi> with an offeringe, and ſonge the Songe accuſtomably v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, when menne goe aborde their ſhippes, and the wée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men daunced after a ditty made in the honour of <hi>Ceres.</hi> But now when the banquette waxed ſomewhat warme, and eche man after his ſorte ſolaced him ſelfe, <hi>Nauſicles</hi> holdinge in his hande a glaſſe of cleare water, ſaide: I drinke to you in water, good <hi>Calaſiris,</hi> and if it wil pleaſe you, to beginne to vs the tale whiche wée ſore deſire to heare, it ſhalbe more pleaſant to vs, then all the Cuppes on this borde. For you heare howe the woomen nowe be at leaſure, and haue well banqueted them ſelues, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginne to Daunce: but your trauell, if it pleaſe you to make reporte of it to vs, ſhall ſhorten woonderfully well
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:6393:72"/>
our feaſte, and be more pleaſant to vs, then any daunce or inſtrument. The tellinge whereof, for as muche as you haue (as you knowe differed diuerſly, for that your miſchaunces ouerwhelmed you) you can reſerue to no better time then this, becauſe your Daughter, one of your Children is well, and your Sonne by the Goddes helpe ſhalbe recouered by and by, if you anger me not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, by driuinge it of any longer. Gods bleſſinge on your harte (ꝙ <hi>Cnemon</hi> to <hi>Nauſicles</hi>) catchinge holde of his talke, who for all that you haue brought to this feaſt, all manner of Muſicall inſtrumentes, doo ſette light by them, and geue the ruder ſorte leaue to heare them, but you your ſelfe are deſirous to heare ſecrete affayres, and ſuche as are ſeaſoned with ſingular mirthe, and me thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth you well vnderſtande the Nature of the Goddes, who ioyne <hi>Mercury,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus</hi> togeather, and adde pleaſauntneſſe of ſpeache to the fineſſe of your banquet. Wherefore although I haue for iuſte cauſe marueiled at the other ſumptuouſneſſe of the Sacrifice, yet I knowe not whether a man maye by any meane pleaſe <hi>Mercury</hi> better, then to talke at his feaſtes, whiche thinge is his Badge aboue all other. <hi>Calaſiris</hi> was content, as well to doo <hi>Cnemon</hi> a pleaſure, as alſo for that he would curry fauour with <hi>Nauſicles,</hi> for that whiche ſhould enſewe, he tolde them all, briefely repetinge the principall pointes of that whiche he had tolde <hi>Cnemon</hi> before, and of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe paſſinge ouer with ſilence, that whiche he thought was to little purpoſe for <hi>Nauſicles</hi> to knowe, but that whiche had not yet benne tolde, and did depende vpon that whiche wente before, he tolde in this ſorte. After they were aborde in the ſhippe of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> and were gonne from <hi>Delphi,</hi> they ſayled as they would wiſhe at the firſte, &amp; had very proſperous winde. But when they came into the <hi>Calidonian</hi> Sea, they were greatly trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, becauſe thei had happened into a Sea, whiche of his<note place="margin">The Calidonian Sea is very trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſome.</note> owne nature, was very diſquiet &amp; troubleſome. <hi>Cnemon</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:6393:73"/>
deſired him that he would not paſſe ouer this, but tell it, if he knew any reaſon of the ragynge of the ſame, in that place. The <hi>Ionian</hi> Sea (ꝙ he) beinge reſtrayned of his<note place="margin">VVhy the Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian Sea, is ſo troubleſome.</note> great breadth, and in a manner brought into ſtraightes, fallinge into the coaſte of <hi>Criſa,</hi> and haſtinge to come in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea called <hi>Egeum,</hi> is ſtopped by <hi>Iſthmus</hi> in <hi>Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponneſus,</hi> ſo perhappes by the prouidence of God is the Hill placed there, leaſt by the violence of the water, it ſhould ouerflowe the lande on the contrary coaſte. And for as muche as from hence the water beaten backe (as may be by reaſon) is reſtrained of his courſe, rather a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Sea, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in any other parte, becauſe that which yet floweth, falleth into that, whiche nowe by <hi>Iſthmus</hi> was made to returne, ſo that the water is much troubled &amp; very boiſterous, by reaſon of the continuall concourſe of the waues, in all the Ebbes and Floudes: whiche opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his, after all theſe who were preſent prayſed, and affirmed to be trewe. <hi>Calaſiris</hi> tolde on his tale, ſaying: After wée had paſſed the Sea, and had loſte the ſight of the <hi>Acute</hi> Ilandes, wée thought that wée diſcouered a Mountaine of <hi>Zacynthus,</hi> in manner of a darke cloude before our eyes, and therewith the Maiſter badde ſtrike ſome of the Sailes, and when we aſked him why, he aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, and wente more eaſily, ſeinge that the ſhippe had a very good gale of winde, becauſe (ſaide he) if we wente with full ſaile aboute the firſte watche wée ſhould ariue at the Ilande, and ſo were it to be doubted, leaſte in the darke, wée runne vpon ſome Rockes whereof are there greate ſtoore, and thoſe very hie. It is therefore wiſedome to lie all night in the Sea, and take the winde in ſuche proportion, as ſhal ſerue to bringe vs thither to lande in the morninge. Thus ſaide the Maiſter, Mary wée did not ſo <hi>Nauſicles,</hi> but euen with the riſinge of the Sunne, wée caſt Ancore. The inhabitauntes of the ſame Iland, whiche dwelt aboute the Hauen, whiche was not farre from the Cittie, came by heapes to looke vpon vs (as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:6393:73"/>
if it had benne ſome ſtraunge ſighte) in greate woonder (as might ſéeme) to ſée the handſomneſſe of that greate Shippe, whiche was builte very faire, accordinge to her height, and ſaide that the induſtry, and excellent woorke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip of the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> might be knowen by that, and that wée had woonderfull good lucke, that made ſo good a viage in the winter, aboute the time the <hi>Pleiades</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pleiades, vuluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie Starres to Marriners.</note> were reddy to ſette. All our company, ere the tacklinges and ſayles were in good order, lefte the Shippe, &amp; wente aboute their Merchandiſe, to the Citty <hi>Zacynthus.</hi> But I (becauſe I hearde by chaunce, of the Maiſter, that they would winter there) wente to ſéeke me ſome Inne about the ſhore, eſche wing the Shippe, for that it was vnméete by reaſon of the rudeneſſe of the Marriners, and the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, for that it was not conuenient for the flight of the yonge couple. After I had gonne a little way, I ſawe an Olde man which was a Fiſher, that ſatte mendinge his broken nettes, before his doore. I came to him, and ſaide good man God ſaue you, and tell me I pray, where a man may gette lodginge? He anſweared me: It was rente a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute a promontory hereby, beinge lette ſlippe vpon a rocke, whiche they ſawe not. I aſke not that ꝙ I, but you ſhal ſhewe vs great curteſie, if either you your ſelfe wilbe our Hoſte, or elles ſhewe vs ſome other Inne. He anſweared, not I, for I was not aborde with them: God defende that <hi>Tyrrhenus</hi> ſhoulde doo ſo muche amiſſe, or haue ſuche a ſpite though he be Olde, but it was my Sonnes defaulte, who knowinge nothinge of the rockes here in the Sea, caſte their nettes where thei ſhould not. At length when with muche adoo, I perceiued that he was ſomewhat harde of hearinge, I ſpake alowde to him and ſaide: God ſpéede you Sir, and I praye you, tell vs where wée may haue an Inne, you are welcome ſaide he againe, and if it pleaſe you abide with me, except you be any of thoſe, that ſéeke for the houſes wherein are many beddes, and haue ſome greate trayne after you. I haue
<pb facs="tcp:6393:74"/>
(ꝙ I) but two children, and I am the thirde my ſelfe, you are a good company (ꝙ he) you ſhall finde one more of vs, for I haue twoo Sonnes that dwell with me (for mine eldeſt Sonnes are Married, and kéepe houſes them ſelues) &amp; the fourth is a Nurſe for my children, becauſe their Mother died but a while agoe, wherefore good man come on and doubte not, but wée will be gladde of you, who are a man which ſéeme to be ſome Gentleman euen by your talke. I did ſo, and ſhortly after I came with<note place="margin">Calaſiris with his children lodge with Tyrrhenus.</note> 
                  <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Cariclia,</hi> and <hi>Tyrrhenus</hi> intertained vs gladly, and lette vs haue the warmer parte of the houſe. Truely we were very wel at the firſte, and had good lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to conferre whole dayes togeather, and when wée ſhould ſléepe, <hi>Cariclia</hi> wente to bedde with the Nurſe, in one place by her ſelfe, and I with <hi>Theagenes</hi> laye in another. <hi>Tyrrhenus</hi> and his Children in a parlour alſo alone tooke their reſte. Wée did eate at one Table all, and ſuche thinges as were néedefull, wée prouided of our owne coſte, beſide Fiſhe whiche <hi>Tyrrhenus</hi> tooke in the Sea, as he woulde ſommetime fiſhe alone: ſommetime wée woulde helpe him at leaſure. For he had all manner of waies to fiſhe, and for all ſeaſons, and the place was well ſtoared, and very conueniente to caſte Nettes: ſo that many woulde aſcribe that gayne whiche they got by their Arte to the benefite of Fortune. But there was<note place="margin">Once vnhappy, and euer vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py. The Merchaunt with whome Calaſiris ſayled falleth in Loue with Cariclia. That is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mm practiſe whiche Louers vſe.</note> none other remedie, but as the Prouerbe is, once vnhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, and euer vnhappy. <hi>Cariclias</hi> bewtie, euen in this ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary place, was not without great broyle: for that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunte of <hi>Tyre,</hi> which was denounced Victor at <hi>Delphi</hi> in the games of <hi>Apollo,</hi> called <hi>Pithia,</hi> with whom wée ſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, came to me alone, and was very importunate, and gréeuous vnto me: beſéechinge me, as if I had benne her Father, that I woulde geue her him to wife. He talked much of him ſelfe, partely by telling of his Noble ſtocke, partely by ſhewinge vs of his riches, and that the Hulke wherein wée ſailed, was his owne, and that the greater
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:6393:74"/>
parte of the Merchandiſe therein, as Golde, Pretious Stoanes of great valewe, and Sylke was his aboue the reſte: and he added alſo his late obteined Victorie, as no ſmall increaſe of his honoure and name, and a thouſande thinges beſide theſe. But I alleged for my ſelfe, our preſente pouertie, and that I woulde neuer marrye my Daughter to one that dwelte in a ſtraunge Countrie, ſo farre from <hi>Egypte.</hi> Leaue this talke, Father (ꝙ he) for I will accoumpte the Mayde a Dowrie woorthe many Talentes, and all the ritches in the worlde. As for my Countrie I will chaunge it for yours, and wil turne my pourpoſed viage to <hi>Carthage,</hi> and goe with you whither ſo euer you will. When I ſawe that the <hi>Phoenician</hi> woulde not geue ouer his determination, and pourpoſe, I determined with faire woordes to driue of the matter, leaſte he ſhoulde attempte any thinge forceibly againſte vs, and promiſed that I woulde fulfill al his deſire when I came into <hi>Egypte.</hi> When I had by this meanes paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him, God laied one miſchiefe vpon an other, as the Prouerbe is. For <hi>Tyrrhenus</hi> not many daies after, when he had carried me into a ſecrete place, on a croked ſhore, ſaide thus to me: <hi>Calaſiris,</hi> I ſweare by <hi>Neptune,</hi> and all other Goddes of the Sea, that I haue loued you, as if you had benne mine owne Brother, and youre children, as if they had benne mine alſo. I will tell you a thinge whiche is woorkinge againſte you, very grée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, and painefull to you: but ſuche as is not lawful for me to conceale, for that wée dwel bothe in one houſe, and it apperteineth altogeather for you to knowe it. There is a Pyrate which waiteth vpon the Hulke of <hi>Phoenicia,</hi> whiche lieth ſecrete vnder the ſide of this Promontory, and ſendeth out Spies daily to enquire when this Ship will goe foorthe.: wherefore looke to your ſelfe, and take héede what you doo, for as muche as this ſhamefuul facte, vſuall to them, is enterpriſed for you, or rather for your Daughter. The Goddes (ꝙ I to him) geue you ſuche
<pb facs="tcp:6393:75"/>
thankes for theſe tidinges, as you deſerue. But <hi>Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhenus,</hi> howe vnderſtoode you theſe thinges? By reaſon of my Crafte I am acquainted with them (ſaide he): and when I bring them victualles, I haue more of them then any men els. Therefore when I drewe my Pottes about the falle of yonder Hill, the Maiſter Pyrate came to me, and aſked, whither I hearde when the <hi>Phoenitians</hi> would leaue their harboure. When I perceiued the ſuttleneſſe of his talke, In faithe <hi>Trachynus</hi> (ꝙ I) I can tell you no certaintie: but I ſuppoſe that at the beginninge of the nexte Spring, they wil ſaile. Wil the Mayde then ſaile with them (ꝙ he) whiche lieth at your houſe? I cannot tell (ꝙ I). But why doo you aſke that? Becauſe (ꝙ he) I loue her in ſuche ſorte, that I am ſcante in my wittes, yet I neuer ſawe her but ones, and I knowe not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I euer ſawe ſo faire a wooman before: yet I haue ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken many priſoners, and ſomme of them very bewtifull. That I mighte the better cauſe him to tell me all his counſell priuely, I ſaide vnto him: What néede you to fighte with the <hi>Phoenicians,</hi> &amp; not rather without Bloud fetche her out of my houſe before they goe aborde. He anſweared me, that Théeues did vſe gentleneſſe, and<note place="margin">Theeues vſe courteſie to their acquaintaunce.</note> courtefie to ſuche as they were acquainted with. I leaue that therefore for your ſake, leaſte my ſo dooinge ſhoulde bringe you into trouble: in as much as the geaſtes which you interteined, would be required againe at your hand. Alſo I deſire to haue twoo thinges at ones: the Riches in the Shippe, and the Marriage of the Mayde: one whereof I muſte néedes lacke, if I attempte this by Lande, and beſide it were very dangerous, if any ſuch thing ſhould be enterpriſed ſo neare the Cittie, leaſte the Rape would be perceiued, and purſute made after. When I had muche commended him for his wiſedome, I leafte him there, and am come to tell you of the Waites which theſe paſtegraces haue laide for you, deſiringe you hartely to deuiſe diligently howe you maie ſaue you, and yours. I
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:6393:75"/>
wente from him very heauie after I hearde this, and thoughte vpon many thinges, vntill the Merchante by chaunce mette me: and fallinge in talke about theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, gaue me a prety beginninge of a wiſe deuiſe. For I concealinge what I liſte, of that <hi>Tyrrhenus</hi> had told me, opened vnto him onely this: That a man thereaboutes, whom he was not hable to withſtande, wente aboute vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olentely to take the Mayde from me. But I (ꝙ I) had rather marry her to you, both for that knowledge which I haue had of you, and alſo for your wealthe: but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for that you promiſed to dwel with vs in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, if you haue her. Wherefore if you deſire to haue her, let vs ſaile hence quickely, before wée be preuented, and haue had ſomme extremitie ſhewed vs. He was woonderfully gladde when he hearde this, and ſaide: Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, this is well deuiſed, and therewithall he came and kiſſed me, and aſked when I woulde commaunde him to departe. Although (ꝙ I) it be vnſeaſonable nowe, yet I would haue you to get you into ſomme other Porte, that wée maie auoide the guiles prepared againſte vs, and there abide for better time. Therefore (ꝙ I) if you will be ruled by me, at the beginninge of the nexte night wée woulde departe. And he, when he had promiſed ſo to doo, wente his waie. I came home, but tolde nothinge of this to <hi>Tyrrhenus:</hi> mary to my Children I ſaide it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoouefull for vs to goe aborde in the eueninge. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though thei marueiled at the ſuddaineneſſe thereof, &amp; aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the mater, yet I draue them of, ſaying, that I would tell them afterwarde, and that there was no remedie nowe, if wée woulde doo well. After wée had eaten a slender Supper, and were gonne to bedde, an Olde man<note place="margin">Vliſſes appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to Calaſiris and rebuketh him for not doo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge Sacrifice to him,</note> appeared to me in my ſléepe, whoſe Body was dried vp, yet he had a Diſſhe tied to his Girdle, who ſéemed in his youthe to haue benne a talle man: he had a Hatte on his heade, and ſéemed by his countenaunce, that he had bene a wiſe, and ſubtile man: mary he halted a litle, as if he
<pb facs="tcp:6393:76"/>
had gotten ſomme Wounde in his Thighe: who, after he came neare me, ſmiled a litle with an angry counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce, and ſaide: You good man, alone of all that haue ſailed by <hi>Cephalene,</hi> and looked vpon my houſe, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coumpted it a great matter to knowe my renoume, haue had no reſpecte to me, but haue ſette ſo lighte by me, that you woulde not ſpeake to me, whiche euery man doothe, for all I dwelt ſo neare you, but you ſhall ere longe be puniſhed for this, and ſhall haue like perilles as I had, &amp; fall into your enemies hande, as wel by Lande as Seas. As for the Mayde that thou carrieſt with thée, ſpeake to her, &amp; gréete her in my Wiues name, becauſe ſhée eſtée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth more of her Virginitie, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any thinge in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> world, wherfore ſhée ſhal haue a luckie ende. I ſtarted for feare of this Viſion, and when <hi>Theagenes</hi> aſked me what I ayled, wée had (ꝙ I) almoſte forgotten the goinge of the ſhippe out of the Hauen, for when I waked, I was ſore troubled with thinkinge thereof. Wherefore gather vp your ſtuffe, and I will call <hi>Cariclia,</hi> who as ſoone as I gaue her warninge came. When <hi>Tyrrhenus</hi> wiſt of this he aroſe alſo, and aſked what wée meant to doo. What ſo euer it be (ꝙ I) that wée doo at this time, it is by your ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe: wée goe aboute to eſcape from them, that awayte vs with miſchiefe, and the Goddes kéepe you in ſafety, who hath plaied the right honeſt man with vs. One good turne I praie doo vs at partinge, goe ouer into <hi>Ithaca,</hi> &amp; doo Sacrifice for vs to <hi>Vlyſſes,</hi> and praye him to appeaſe his wrathe towardes vs, for that as he hath tolde me to night in my ſléepe, he is greately offended, as if he had benne diſpiſed and ſet at naught. He promiſed he would ſo doo, and conducted vs to our ſhippe, and wepte woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully, and prayed to God that he would graunte vs a proſperous viage, accordinge to our hartes deſire. To be ſhorte, by daie wée were in the middeſt of the Sea, but the Marriners at the firſte were greatly againſte it, yet at length thei were perſwaded by the Merchant of <hi>Tyre,</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:6393:76"/>
becauſe he tolde them that they fledde certaine Pyrates that purſued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, of whiche he had warninge. He meante<note place="margin">Many times Ieſtes turned to good earneſt as did his now.</note> to tell them this for a tale, and knewe not that he ſayde truthe. But the windes and weather were ſore againſt vs, ſo that the Sea was very rough, and wée in a greate tempeſt, very neare to be caſt awaie, yet at length when wée had loſte halfe our rudder, and broken the moſt parte of our ſayle yardes, wée arriued in a certaine Harboure of <hi>Crete.</hi> We thought it good therefore to tarry there cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine daies, aſwell to repayre our ſhippe, as alſo to eaſe our ſelues. When theſe thinges were donne, it was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed that wée ſhoulde ſayle, the firſte Mondaie after the chaunge of the Moone, we were carried into the déepe Seas, with the Eaſterly winde, a daye and a night, and our Maiſter directed our Hulke to the coaſt of <hi>Aphrique.</hi> For he ſaide that if the winde blewe, and wée kepte a ſtraight courſe, wée might paſſe the mayne Sea, and he made all haſte poſſible to come to the mayne Lande, or into ſome Hauen, for the Barke whiche he ſawe out of the pupe was a Pyrate. For euer ſithence wée looſed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the promontory of <hi>Crete,</hi> he followeth vs, and neuer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clineth one iote from our courſe, but purſueth our ſhippe, as if it went our viage with vs: for I haue perceiued this diuerſe times, when I turned aboute of purpoſe our ſhip from his right courſe, that hath alſo turned. When he had ſaide this, ſome were moued, and exhorted the reſte to make them ready to defenſe, but ſome made lighte thereof. Sayinge that the ſhorter ſhippes might well o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uertake ſuche as are greater, for that thei know by more experience the certainety of theire waye. While theſe things were diſputed on, vpon bothe partes, it was that time of the daie, that the Huſbandman dothe vnyoke his Oxen from the ploughe, and the vehement winde began to waxe caulme, ſo that within a little while it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt downe, &amp; blewe ſoftly to no purpoſe on our ſailes, whereby it rather huffed them together, then made any
<pb facs="tcp:6393:77"/>
way for our ſhippe. At length it ceaſed quite, as if at the Sunne ſettinge it had appointed to leaue blowinge, or rather (that I may ſpeake more truely) to doo them which followed vs a good turne, for thei that were in the Barke as longe as wée had winde, were farre behind our ſhippe whiche was ful fraughted, as is good reaſon, for that our greater ſayles receiued more winde. But after the Seas were caulme, and wée of force conſtrained to rowe, the darke came vpon vs ſooner then a man would thinke, in as muche (as I thinke) euery one of them rowed, and ſo made the light barke whiche was more fitte for that purpoſe, goe the faſter. When they drewe ſomewhat néere, one of the menne of <hi>Zacynthus</hi> which came aborde with vs cried out. This is a Pyrates ſhippe, mates, I knowe <hi>Trachinus</hi> barke: al y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Hulke was moued at theſe newes, &amp; in a calme weather had it a great tempeſt, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry parte thereof was filled with great noiſe, lamenting, and runninge vp and downe, ſomme ranne into the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther partes of the Shippe: ſomme ſtoode vpon the Hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and exhorted one an other to fighte: ſomme were of opinion, that it was beſte to goe into the Cocke Boate, and be gonne. Vntill (before they determined any thing) the preſente ſkirmiſhe appeaſed their adoo, for that euery man muſt néedes by that time méete one in Harneis. I, &amp; <hi>Cariclia</hi> hung about <hi>Theagenes,</hi> who deſired ſore to fight, &amp; coulde ſcante make him geue ouer. Shée ſaide to him, that ſhée woulde not be parted from him by Deathe, but that ſhée would, with the ſame Swoorde, &amp; like wounde, abide ſuche happe, as he felte. But I, after I perceiued that it was <hi>Trachinus,</hi> whiche came on, thoughte vpon ſommewhat whiche mighte doo vs good afterwarde, whiche in déede tooke effecte: for as ſoone as the Pyrates were comme, they wente aboute vs, without caſtinge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Dartes at vs, ſo tryinge, if by any meanes they mighte take the Hulke without battaile: mary they ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed rounde aboute vs, and woulde ſuffer the Shippe to
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:6393:77"/>
goe no further. So that they were like, as if they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged vs, and deſired to take our Shippe vpon certaine Conditions, and ſaide: Why be you ſo madde (you vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy folkes) why attempte you to ſturre againſte ſuche inuincible ſtrengthe, and that whiche farre ſurmounteth yours: thereby to purchaſe youre certaine Deſtruction? Yet wée vſe you friendely, and geue you leaue to take your Cocke, and ſaue your liues, if you will. Theiſe Conditions they propounded. But they, who were in the Hulke, as longe as they were without daunger, and the Battaile was without bloude, were very ſtoute, and ſaide plainely, that they would not departe. But when one of the Pyrates bolder then the reſte, ſtepte aborde,<note place="margin">VVarres are made with ſlaughter and blondſhedde.</note> and with his ſwoorde flewe al them that he mette, and taughte them, that Warres were accuſtomably made with Slaughter, and Deathe. Then the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented them of theire ſo dooinge: and fallinge flatte on theire faces, praied them of mercie, for that they woulde doo what they would haue them. They, for al that they were nowe gredy to kill (for the ſighte of Bloude is a<note place="margin">The ſight of bloude, maketh menne egar to fighte.</note> greate mouing to the minde): yet by commaundement of <hi>Trachinus,</hi> contrary to al hope, they ſpared them. Surely their Conditions were hainous, &amp; for al the cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>terfeited name of Peace, it was cruell Warre in déede by reaſon of the Truce which was propounded to them, more tol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable then the Battaile it ſelfe. For ſtraighte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente was geuen, that euery man ſhoulde goe out of the Shippe with one ſute of Apparell onely, and that he ſhoulde die that brake the ſame. It ſéemeth, that<note place="margin">Men ſette more by their liues, then any thinge els.</note> men ſette more by theire liues, then any thinge els: for which alſo, the <hi>Phoenicians</hi> without al hope of the goodes in the Shippe, as if they had loſte nothinge, but rather made a good Market, got out of the Ship, euery man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiringe to ſaue him ſelfe firſte. After wée alſo were there ready to obey theire Decrée, <hi>Trachinus</hi> takinge vp <hi>Cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clia,</hi> ſaide vnto her: This Warre nothinge belongethe to

thée, my Déere, but hathe benne enterpriſed for thy ſake, and I haue folowed you euer ſince you ſayled from <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cynthus:</hi> onely for you haue I aduentured theſe perilles by Sea. Wherefore feare not, but be of good comforte, and knowe, that you ſhal be Ladye of al theſe with me. Thus he ſaide. But ſhée (for it is a pointe of wiſedome<note place="margin">It is wiſedome to haue reſpect of time.</note> to haue reſpecte to time, and to turne al to the beſte (very diſcretely, beinge greatly chéered with mine aduice, and what I had tolde her, as touchinge theſe preſente miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes, with a countenance ſo ſéemely, as woulde haue allured any man, ſaide, I geue the Goddes thankes, who haue geuen you a harte to deale more gently with vs, then the reſte. But if you will haue me to be bolde in déede, and to tarrye, ſhewe me this for a token of youre good wil: ſaue this my Brother, and my Father, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunde them not out of the Shippe alſo: for if theſe be from me, there is no waie to ſaue me aliue. And when ſhée had ſaide thus, ſhée felle at his knées, and helde him faſte. <hi>Trachinus</hi> was wel pleaſed with her ſo holding, and deferred his promiſe of pourpoſe. At length moued with her teares to compaſſion, was by her countenance forced to fulfil her wil, after he had taken vp the Mayde, ſaide thus: I geue this your Brother to you with all my harte: for I ſée he is a yong man of ſtoute courage, which maie doo vs good ſeruice. As for the Olde man, whiche is but a chargeable burthen without profite, let him tarrye onely for your pleaſure. While theſe thinges were ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge, and dooinge, the Sunne came out of his courſe, to his ſettinge, and made that ſpace betwéene the daie, and the nighte darke: the Sea, either changinge by reaſon of the time, or els by the wil of Fortune, beganne to waxe roughe, and a man mighte heare a greate noyſe of the Windes ariſinge, whoſe greate and valiante Blaſtes ſuddainely muche abaſſhed the Pyrates, by reaſon that they al had lefte the Barke, and were buſie in the Hulke aboute ſpoylinge of the Merchandiſe therein, and knewe
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:6393:78"/>
not howe to vſe the greatneſſe of the ſame. Wherefore<note place="margin">A prety deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of a ſhippe in a tempeſt, in which are none but vnſkilfull Marriners.</note> euery parte was ordered of euery man vnaduiſedly, ſo that eche of them beganne to practiſe that, whiche he had neuer donne before: ſomme ſtroke the Sailes on heapes: other intangled the Ropes without ſkill: one ignorante felowe tooke the Rudder in hande: an other as wiſe as he was in the Foreſhip. The greateſt thinge that brought vs into perill, was not the Tempeſte, which was not yet very greate, but the vnſkilfulneſſe of the Maiſter, who as longe as he coulde ſée any lighte of the daie, ſtoode to it, but when it was darke gaue ouer his charge. When therefore they were in daunger of drowninge, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte ſunke, ſomme of the Pyrates woulde haue gonne into their owne Barke againe, but they helde the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues contente, beinge diſappointed of theire pourpoſe by the force of the Tempeſte: and <hi>Trachinus</hi> counſel, who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded them that they ſhoulde haue ſixe hundred ſuche litle Barkes, if they keapte the Hulke and the Kitches therein whole: and at laſte he cutte of the Rope whereby it was tied to the Hulke, ſaieinge, that it woulde bringe them into an other Tempeſte: wherefore it was beſte to woorke wiſely to be ſafe afterwarde, for it was a ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous<note place="margin">It is wiſedome to foreſee.</note> matter to ariue in any place with twoo Shippes, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge it muſte néedes comme to paſſe, that inquirye muſt be made of thoſe that ſailed in the one. And he ſéemed to ſpeake probably, and by dooinge that one thinge, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proue his deuiſe in twoo matters. They had but litle re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie when the Barke was gonne, neither were they out of peril, but toſſed with continual Waues without ceaſinge: ſo that they loſte many partes of their Shippe, vntil after that nighte aboute the Sunne ſettinge of the nexte daie, they landed by chaunce at a certaine Mouthe of a Hauen of <hi>Nilus,</hi> called <hi>Heracliote</hi> in <hi>Egypte</hi> againſte our willes, vnhappy creatures. Somme were gladde thereof, but wée wer very ſorrowful, and accoumpted the benefite of our health that wée had of the Sea, a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proche:
<pb facs="tcp:6393:79"/>
in as muche as it enuied vs a Deathe without<note place="margin">It is better to die with honour then liue with ſhame.</note> al iniurie, and committed vs to lande, whiche was more ſorrowful then it: in as much as nowe wée were ſubiecte vtterly to the Pyrates, that they might doo with vs their will, whiche mighte eaſily be gheaſſed by that whiche thoſe Villaines attempted before they came aſhore. For by reaſon that they ſaide they woulde doo Sacrifice to <hi>Neptune,</hi> to geue him thankes for theire ſafetie, they broughte alande Wine of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and many ſuche thinges els out of the Shippe, and ſente ſomme of their mates to the Borders adioining to buie cattel with a greate deale of Money, and gaue them charge to paie what ſo euer was aſked at the firſte woorde. After ſo dooinge, they ſtraight waie returned, and brought with them a whole Hearde of Swine and Shéepe, and they whiche tarried behinde, had made the fiers, and fleaed the beaſtes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poited for the Sacrifice: they wente to theire Feaſte, <hi>Trachinus</hi> tooke me aſide, ſo that none mighte heare, and ſaid to me: Father, I am determined to take thy Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter<note place="margin">Trachinus would Marrie Cariclia out of hande.</note> to wife, and marry her this daie, ſo that I pourpoſe to ioine this pleaſante Solemnitie with the Sacrifice of the Goddes. Wherefore leaſte you in the Feaſte (if you hearde not of this before) ſhould be any thinge ſadde: but that you mighte tell youre Daughter hereof, and cauſe her to be of a chéereful courage, I thoughte it good to tell you my minde, not for that I néede your conſente, for I haue Abſolute power to doo what I liſte. But bicauſe I accoumpte it more luckie, and ſéemely alſo, if the Bride<note place="margin">It is a good ſight at a Brydale, to ſee the Bride mery.</note> more chéerefully prepare her ſelfe, beinge admoniſhed thereof firſte by her Father. I praiſed his opinion, and made as though I had benne gladde, and gaue thankes to the Goddes that they had appointed my Maiſter to be my Daughters Huſbande. And when I was gonne, I beganne to thinke on that whiche was to comme, and came to him againe, and beſought him, that that whiche was newe begonne, mighte be donne more ſolemnely,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:6393:79"/>
and that he would appointe the Hulke to be the Maydes Bedchamber, and geue commaundemente that no man might goe in and trouble her, that ſhée migt prouide that whiche was méete to furniſhe, and ſette foorthe a Bride by leaſure. For it were il ordered, if ſhée, whiche is of a good ſtocke, and very ritche, and (that whiche is greateſt) ſhalbe <hi>Trachinus</hi> wife, ſhoulde not be made ſo handſome as ſhée might be, althoughe time and place wil not geue her leaue to be very trimme. <hi>Trachinus</hi> was very glad of this, and promiſed it ſhoulde be ſo with all his harte: and therewith he gaue charge, that all ſuche thinges as they ſhoulde haue néede of, ſhoulde be carried out, and that after none ſhoulde comme neare the Shippe. They did as he commaunded them: they brought out Tables, Cuppes, Carpettes, Cloathes of <hi>Arrace,</hi> Woorkes of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and <hi>Tyre,</hi> &amp; other ſuche thinges, as were expediente to the furniture of a feaſt: eche one brought out of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Ship thinges vpon their ſhoulders, without reſpecte or order, ſuche as diuerſe men with greate trauel, and thryftie v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage had gathered togeather: but now Fortune had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared them to ſerue their Prodigal Banquette. But I tooke <hi>Theagenes</hi> with me, and when we came to <hi>Cariclia,</hi> and founde her wéepinge, ſaide, Daughter, this is no newes to you: marry I knowe not, whether it be for your olde il fortune, or any newe miſhhappe. For bothe (ꝙ ſhée), but aboue al thinges, for that which I am afraid of, which is the hated good wil of <hi>Trachinus,</hi> which time, as is like, procureth for ſuch ſucceſſe, as is not looked for,<note place="margin">Succeſſe not loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked for, dothe make menne doo otherwiſe often times then els they would doo.</note> is accuſtomed to moue menne to doo il. But <hi>Trachinus,</hi> and his Loue whiche I hate ſo muche, ſhal be ſorrowful, which I wil preuente with Deathe. And to thinke that I ſhoulde be deuided from you and <hi>Theagenes</hi> before the ende (if that came to paſſe) cauſed me to be thus heauie. You thinke (ꝙ I) in déede as it is: for <hi>Trachinus,</hi> after the Sacrifice, meaneth to chaunge the Banquette into his, and your Bridall, and made me (as I had bene your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther)
<pb facs="tcp:6393:80"/>
priuie thereto, who knewe before his vnreaſonable loue that he bare to you, by Communication that I had with <hi>Tyrrhenus</hi> in <hi>Zacynthus,</hi> but I did not tell you thereof, leaſte you ſhoulde haue benne diſcouraged for feare of thoſe miſhappes, ſeinge alſo that we might haue auoided his ſnares. But my Children, ſéeinge God wil not let this comme to paſſe, and that wée are nowe in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme perill, attempte ſomme woonderful, and courragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enterpriſe to withſtande this increaſinge euill, whereby wée ſhal liue fréely euer after, if wee haue good lucke: or els accoumpte it aduantage if wée ſaile, to die Chaſtely, and like menne. After they promiſed to doo what I woulde commaunde them, and I had taughte them what was beſte to doo, I leafte them makinge ſuch prouiſion as was requiſite, and came to that Pyrate, which was chiefe next <hi>Trachinus</hi> (whoſe name I thinke, was <hi>Pelorus</hi>) and ſaide, that I had a thinge to lel him for his profite. He was ready. And after I had broughte<note place="margin">The crafty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe of Calaſiris to hinder the Marriage of Trachinus and Cariclia, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates are ſlaine.</note> him where none mighte heare, I ſaide: Geue eare my Sonne ſhortely, for the ſhorteneſſe of the time will not ſuffer me to be very longe: my Daughter is in loue with thée, as ouercomme with the better man: marry ſhée ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecteth that the Archepyrate maketh this Banquette to marrye her, for he ſéemed to meane ſomme ſuche thinge, when he gaue her commaundemente to decke her ſelfe ſomewhat finely. Wherefore conſider howe you maie vndoo that, and haue her your ſelfe. For ſhée ſaithe, ſhée wil rather die, then marrye <hi>Trachinus.</hi> Then ſaide he, be of good chéere: for in as muche as I haue benne aſwell minded that waie, as the Mayde, I deſired to haue ſome occaſion, and meane profered to take that mater in hand a good while agoe. Wherefore <hi>Trachinus</hi> ſhal ſuffer me to marry her of his owne frée wil, or els he ſhal haue but a ſoary Marriage, by ſufferinge that at my hande, that he hathe wel deſerued. I haſted backe for feare of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when I hearde him ſaie thus, and comminge to my

Children comforted them, and tolde them howe my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe tooke good effect: Within a littell after we wente to Supper. Then I, when I ſawe them well whitled with wine, and wantonly bent, whiſpered <hi>Pelorus</hi> in the eare (for I ſatte nexte him of purpoſe) and ſayde, haue you ſéene howe the Mayde is dreſſed? He anſweared me no: But you may ꝙ I nowe, if you goe priuely to the ſhippe, for you knowe <hi>Trachinus</hi> hath geuen contrary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundement, you ſhal ſée <hi>Diana</hi> her ſelfe ſitte there: but ſo behaue your ſelfe, that you be not ouer bolde to behold her, leaſt you purchaſe deathe to you bothe. He tarried not, but as if he had ſome very earneſt buſineſſe, aroſe &amp; came priuily into the Hulke, and when he ſawe <hi>Cariclia</hi> were a Crowne of Lawrell on her head, and gliſter in her Garment garniſhed with Golde, (for ſhée had put on the holy apparell whiche ſhée brought from <hi>Delphi,</hi> to be a furniture either to her Victory, or els bewtie to her bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall) &amp; ſuche other thinges aboute her, as might beſéeme a Marriage well, was ſet on fire (as was like he woulde be) with that ſight, in as muche as deſire and emulation pricked him forwarde, and it was euident by his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce when he returned, that he intended to doo ſome miſchieuous thinge, for ere he was well ſette downe, he ſaide, why haue not I the rewarde dewe to him that firſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Then I wil haue ꝙ he, the Mayde which is taken pryſoner. But when <hi>Trachinus</hi> had ſaide, beſide her take what you will. <hi>Pelorus</hi> beganne to ſaie, then doo<note place="margin">A Lawe of the Pyrates.</note> you diſanull and abrogate the Lawe of Pyrates, whiche geueth him, which firſte entreth the enimies ſhippe, and hath for all his mates aduentured him ſelfe to the moſte daungerous parte of the ſkirmiſhe, leaue to choſe what liketh him beſte.

For my parte I loue the Mayde

woonderfully well, and meane to take her to my wife. And I ſaye plainely it is reaſon that I choſe before you, and if you doo not as the Lawe willes you, you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent it with a blowe of this potte. Then ſaide <hi>Pelorus</hi> to thoſe that were by, you ſée what is the rewarde of our trauell? ſo ſhall any of you hereafter be put beſide your due. What els might any man ſée there <hi>Nauſicles?</hi> you might haue compared thoſe men ſo ſuddainely, moued to the Sea: ſo blinde and fooliſhe a quarell drawe them to ſo greate a broyle, beinge with Wine and anger almoſte made ſtarke madde. Some tooke this mans parte, ſome his, one ſorte would haue the honour geuen to the Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, an other ſaide that the lawe and ordinance might not be broken.

But I wente a greate way of, and from the toppe of a little Hill looked vpon them out of all daunger.

Now could

For then he plucked vp his harte, whiche was ſore wounded before, and leapt neare <hi>Pelorus,</hi> and with his ſwoorde ſtroke a full blowe at his head, but miſſed thereof, for that he auoyded the blowe a little, but he cutte his arme from his ſhoulder, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he fledde, &amp; <hi>Theagenes</hi> purſued him, what followed I cannot tell but that he returned againe, and I ſawe him not, for that I tarried on the Hill, and durſte not be oner bolde to walke in the nighte in a place ſo full of eni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, but <hi>Cariclia</hi> eſpied him wel yenoughe, for I percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued when it was day, that he laie like a deade man, and ſhée ſate by him, and wepte, and declared that ſhée would kil her ſelfe, but ſhée helde her hande for a litle hope that ſhée had of his life. But I vnhappy man, could not ſpeake to them, nor know the trothe, nor comforte their calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie before that as greate miſhappes by Lande, as theſe were by Sea, happened to vs without any delaie. For as ſoone as I ſawe the daie appeare, and was comminge downe the Hill, I ſpied a companie of Théeues of <hi>Egypt,</hi> runne from a Mountaine whiche ſtretcheth that waye by ſéeminge, and by this time had taken the yonge cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and within a while after carried them awaie, and what ſo euer els they coulde out of the Shippe. I ſpake to no pourpoſe a farre of, and bewailed my Forture, and theirs in vaine, for that I coulde not defende them, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thought I it beſte to comme emong them, for that I would reſerue my ſelfe, in hope to helpe them afterward.
<pb facs="tcp:6393:82"/>
So I tarried behinde, for that by reaſon of mine age I was not ſo wel hable as the Théeues to runne downe<note place="margin">The firſte booke declareth howe they were han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled afterward the beginninge and proceſſe whereof, order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foloweth, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge of Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiris tale almost in the ende of the ſeconde Booke.

He was content, and they went together, <hi>Cariclia</hi> beſought them muche that ſhée might goe with them, but ſhée was forced to tarry behinde, becauſe <hi>Nauſicles</hi> tolde her, they neither woulde goe farre, and that they woulde ſafe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne againe, &amp; bringe <hi>Theagenes</hi> alſo. Thus they lefte her waueringe betwene ſorrowe for their departinge, and ioye for hope of that ſhée deſired. They were no ſooner out of the Village, and paſte the bankes of <hi>Nilus,</hi> but they ſawe a <hi>Crocodyle,</hi> which crept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the right ſide to the other, and diued vnder the water, as faſte as it coulde.

Therewith ſpake <hi>Calaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> after he ſawe <hi>Nauſicles</hi> laughe and ſaide, <hi>Cnemon,</hi> I thought that you had benne onely afraide by nighte, for the noiſe and darkeneſſe thereof, but you are ouer hardy euen by daie as maye appeare, that are not afraide of names alone, but of ſuche thinges alſo as are common, and euery man knoweth, and are not to be regarded.

What Goddes name, or heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ly Creature is it, that this good man cannot abide, ſaide <hi>Nauſicles?</hi> Nay, if it were a God, or any heauenly Creature, ſaide <hi>Calaſiris,</hi> then had I nothinge to ſaie, but it is an humaine name, and that whiche is more to be marueiled at, not any mans whiche hath benne famous for his renoumed Actes, but a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, and ſhée dead (as he ſaieth) if à man maye be bolde to ſpeake it. For yeſternight when you brought me home <hi>Cariclia</hi> ſafe from the Heardmen: he hearinge this name that I talke of, I knowe not why, nor wherefore, woulde not ſuffer me to ſléepe any whitte, beinge ready ſtill to die for feare, ſo that I had muche a doo to call him againe, and if I thought that I ſhoulde not gréeue him, nor make him afraide, I would name it nowe alſo, that you might laughe the more, and therewithall he named <hi>Thisbe.</hi> When <hi>Nauſicles</hi> hearde this, he laughed no more, but was very ſadde, and ſtoode in a ſtudy a greate while, muſinge in his minde what <hi>Cnemon</hi> had to doo with <hi>Thisbe,</hi> or how ſhée harmed him in any ſorte. Then beganne <hi>Cnemon</hi> to laughe woonderfully for ioye and ſaide: you ſée good <hi>Calaſiris,</hi> of what force this Name is, and that it dothe not onely abaſhe and feare me, but our good friende <hi>Nauſicles</hi> alſo: for it hath brought him to a woonderful change of his chéere. As for me now I laugh becauſe I knowe ſhée is not aliue, but luſty <hi>Nauſicles</hi> laughed other menne to ſcorne not longe agoe. Make an ende, <hi>Cnemon,</hi> ſaide <hi>Nauſicles,</hi> for you haue taken reue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge inough of me nowe. But I praie you tel me by the Gods of Hoſpitalitie and friendſhippe, and by the mirthe and chéere, whiche with eſpeciall good will (in mine opinion) you haue had in mine houſe, what meane you by <hi>Thisbes</hi> name, whether you knowe whence ſhée was in déede, or doo it to feare me, or els haue deuiſed it as a ieſte againſt me. Then ſpake <hi>Calaſiris,</hi> now it behooueth you to tell vs of your Fortune, <hi>Cnemon,</hi> whiche, for al that you of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes promiſed to communicate with me, you haue

But nowe you maye doo it very well, bothe to pleaſure <hi>Nauſicles,</hi> and alſo to take awaie with your talke the wearineſſe of our iourneye. <hi>Cnemon</hi> did ſo, and tolde them al briefly, which he before had tolde to <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Cariclia,</hi> that he was borne in Athens, and <hi>Ariſtippus</hi> was his Fathers name, and <hi>Demeneta</hi> was his Mother in lawe. He tolde them alſo of the wicked Loue whiche <hi>Demeneta</hi> bare to him, and how that when ſhée coulde not come to her purpoſe, ſhée awaited him with crafty ſleightes by meanes of <hi>Thisbe,</hi> who was ſuborned by her ſo to doo. He added the manner alſo, and then that he was baniſhed his Countrie by the people, ſo puniſhinge him, as if he had benne a Paricide, and that <hi>Charias</hi> firſte one of his companions tolde him lyinge in <hi>Egina,</hi> that <hi>Demeneta</hi> was dead, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of her death, being alſo beguiled by <hi>Thisbe</hi> her ſelfe. After this that <hi>Anticles</hi> tolde him, how his Father was brought into miſerie, by confiſcatinge of his goodes, for<note place="margin">Ariſtippus vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donne by meanes of his ſeconde wife.</note> that <hi>Demenetas</hi> kinſfolkes gathered them ſelues togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to condemne him, and brought the people in ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that he had donne that Murther. Then how <hi>Thisbe</hi> fledde from <hi>Athens</hi> with a Louer of hers, whiche was a Merchant of <hi>Naucratia.</hi> Laſte of al he reherſed, how that<note place="margin">Naucratia a Cittie in Egypt.</note> he with <hi>Anticles</hi> ſailed into <hi>Egypte</hi> to ſéeke <hi>Thisbe,</hi> that if by happe they coulde finde her, they woulde bringe her backe to <hi>Athens,</hi> and deliuer his Father from that ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and take reuenge of her, and after he had fallen into diuerſe miſhappes by the waie, at length he was taken by Pyrates, then after he had eſcaped by a meane, he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riued againe in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and was taken of the Heardmen, and there fell acquainted with <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Cariclia.</hi> And thereto he added <hi>Thisbes</hi> deathe, and other thinges in order, vntil he came to that whiche <hi>Calaſiris,</hi> and <hi>Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicles</hi> knewe well yenough. This tale ended, <hi>Nauſicles</hi> had ſixe hundred thoughtes in his minde, ſometime thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge to tell them of <hi>Thisbe</hi> and him ſelfe, and yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termininge

to deferre it a while. At laſt with muche adoo he helde his tongue, partly for that he thought it beſte ſo to doo, partely alſo for that an other chaunce ſtayed him. For after they had gonne about ſeuen miles and a halfe, &amp; were almoſte at the towne, where <hi>Mytranes</hi> dwelled, they mette one whom <hi>Nauſicles</hi> knewe well, and aſked him whither he we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ſo faſte.

When he had ſayde thus, he wente his waie, ſayinge I muſte in haſte to <hi>Iſias,</hi> who e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen nowe perhappes with her angry eies looketh aboute for me, leaſt this longe tariynge, be any impediment to me in my Loue: for ſhée is too politike to accuſe and finde faulte with me without cauſe. When they hearde this, they were amaſed, and ſtoode ſtill a great while without
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:6393:84"/>
ſaying any woorde, for that they were diſappointed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their exſpectation, vntill at length <hi>Nauſicles</hi> co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and chéered them, ſayinge that they ought not, for beinge a little diſappointed, whiche ſhall not be longe to diſpayre of al that they haue in hande. But now it is beſt to returne to <hi>Chemmis,</hi> and there to conſulte of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and goe to ſéeke <hi>Theagenes</hi> with better prouiſion, whether he be with the Heardmen or els whereſoeuer, and to haue good comforte to finde him euery where. For wée maie not thinke this is donne without the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, that wée mette with one of our acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who by that he tolde vs, hath ledde vs as it were by the hande thither, where wée maie ſéeke <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and hath taught vs the waie to the place where the Heardmen dwell, as to a certaine place of ſpéede. When he had ſaide this, he eaſily perſwaded the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for as I thinke they gathered a farther hope by that whiche was tolde them. And <hi>Cnemon</hi> alſo by him ſelfe comforted <hi>Calaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and badde him be of good chéere, for that <hi>Thiamis</hi> woulde vſe <hi>Theagenes</hi> well.

Without doubte (as I may gheaſſe) <hi>Theagenes</hi> is deade. Wherefore I pray you by al the Goddes, if you haue any thinge to ſaie tell me, and increaſe not my ſorrowe with prolonginge the reherſall thereof. Surely it is a pointe<note place="margin">It is a pointe of courteſie to tell a miſchaunce quickely.</note> of curteſie, to tell a miſhappe quickly, as that which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the minde to be ready to reſiſt the greatneſſe of the euill, and ſoone maketh it weary of the griefe. Then <hi>Cnemon</hi> with much adoo, breakinge of her ſorrow: ſaide, for ſhame <hi>Cariclia</hi> what faſcion is this? you are alwaies ready in a manner to iudge the woorſte, but that falſely, in whiche pointe you doo well. For <hi>Theagenes</hi> is, and by grace of the Goddes ſhall be well: and therewith he tolde
<pb facs="tcp:6393:85"/>
her briefly how, and with whome. To that ſayde <hi>Calaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> it ſéemeth by this that you haue ſaide, <hi>Cnemon,</hi> that you were neuer in Loue, for then ſhoulde you know for certaintie that thinges wherein is no daunger at all, are fearefull to Louers, and they truſte nothinge but theire<note place="margin">Louers truſte nothinge but their owne eyes.</note> owne cies, in that whiche they beſte like, and would fai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt haue, the abſence of whiche bréedeth feare and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nineſſe in the hartes, that be entangled with ſuch deſire. Another cauſe is that either moſte déere to other haue perſwaded them ſelues, that they will neuer be parted, except ſome great impediment procure their ſeperation. Wherefore <hi>Cnemon</hi> wée pardon <hi>Cariclia,</hi> who loueth perfectly in déede, and lette vs goe in and conſulte of that wée haue to doo.

And after they were well ſuffiſed with the feaſte as he thought, he ſpake thus to them: My gheaſtes (the Goddes are witneſſes of that I ſaie) your preſence is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry<note place="margin">Nauſicles Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion tendinge to this end, to haue Cnemon marrie his Daughter.</note> acceptable to me, if you would liue here alwaies, and take all that is mine (though I eſtéeme it neuer ſo well) for your owne. And for as muche as I accoumpt you no Straungers, but as my Louers and trewe Friendes, henceforwarde it ſhall be no burthen that I beſtowe vpon you: And alſo I will be ready as longe as I tarry with you, to craue of my friendes to doo for you, what ſo euer they can in all matters. But you your ſelues know, that my trade of life ſtandeth by Merchaundiſe, and this I vſe and practiſe as if it were a Farme.

After this <hi>Calaſiris</hi> pauſinge a while, ſaide: <hi>Nauſicles,</hi> God ſend you a good viage, and <hi>Mercury</hi> who geueth the gaine, &amp; <hi>Neptune</hi> geuinge quiet paſſage, beare you company, and be your Guides, and make euery Hauen a good Harbour to you, and euery Cittie eaſie for you to trade in, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of Merchauntes, becauſe you haue intertained vs ſo friendly while we haue benne with you, and now wée minde to departe, doo ſuffer vs to goe ſo gently, obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge in euery pointe the Lawes of Hoſpitalitie, and Friendſhippe. As for vs although it grieue vs greatly to departe from you and your houſe, whiche you haue cauſed vs to take for our owne, yet wée muſt néedes goe ſéeke thoſe whom wée holde moſte déere, and this is <hi>Cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clias</hi> determination and mine.

But thou ſéemeſt to take this

from me againe: whither ſhal I turne my ſelfe? or what ſhall I doo? ſhal I leaue <hi>Cariclia</hi> who hath not yet founde <hi>Theagenes?</hi> that is vntollerable and may not be donne: ſhal I goe with her to ſéeke him: if wée were ſure to finde<note place="margin">To what ende paines ſhoulde be taken.</note> him, it were well donne to take paynes in hope of a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ende, but if that whiche is to come be vncertaine, and wée happe to fall into greater ſorrowe, no man can tell where my trauell ſhall ende. But what if I craue par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of you and the Goddes of friendſhippe, and nowe at length make mention of returninge into my Countrie and Family?

And as ſhée had ſpoken thus, ſhée caſte her ſelfe grouelinge on her Bedde, and ſore ſighinge, and pitifully mourninge ſhée claſped her armes harde togeather, vntil a certaine amaſedneſſe, and dazeling, caſte as it were a miſte before her, vnderſtandinge parte of the minde, and brought her aſléepe, and helde her til it was lighte daie. Wherfore <hi>Calaſiris</hi> marueiled that he ſaw her not as he was woont to doo, in ſearchinge for her, came to her Chamber, where knockinge ſommewhat harde, and callinge alowde, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclia,</hi> waked her at lengthe. Shée was abaſſhed at that ſuddaine calle, and came as ſhée was attyred, and vnbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the doore to lette in the Olde man. Who ſéeinge her Heare diſordered, and her Garmentes cutte before her breaſte with her eies ful of water, vnderſtoode the cauſe: and when he had broughte her to her Bedde againe, and had cauſed her to attyre her ſelfe, &amp; caſt a Cloke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, he ſaide: for ſhame, <hi>Cariclia,</hi> what arraye is this? why doo you vexe your ſelfe ſo ſore without ceaſing? why yéelde you to all chaunces without reaſon? Surely nowe I knowe you not, whom till nowe I euer knewe to be of excellente courage, and very modeſt.

to doo this, but pure, aud chaſte Loue that I beare to a man (although he neuer touched me) &amp; y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is <hi>Theagenes,</hi> who maketh me thus ſadde becauſe he is not here with me, &amp; I am the more afraide alſo, for that I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not knowe whether he be aliue or not. As touchinge this matter ſaide <hi>Calaſiris,</hi> be of good chéere, and thinke that he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, and one whom the Goddes haue appointed to liue with you: if wée muſte geue any credite to that whiche the Oracle hath foreſhewed vs. Wée muſte alſo beléeue him, who tolde vs yeſterdaie that <hi>Thyamis</hi> tooke him pryſoner, as he was carried towarde <hi>Memphis,</hi> and if he be taken without doubte he is wel, for as muche as there hath benne acquaintaunce and familiaritie betwixte the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> before. Wherefore wée ought not to ſtaie but goe to <hi>Beſſa</hi> and ſéeke, you for <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and I for my Sonne, for you haue heard ere now that <hi>Thyamis</hi> is my Sonne.<note place="margin">Thyamis was Calaſiris Sonne.</note> Then was <hi>Cariclia</hi> in great thought, and ſaide: If <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amis</hi> be your Sonne in déede, then are wée in woorſe caſe then euer wée were. <hi>Calaſiris</hi> marueiled hereat, and aſked her why. You know (ꝙ ſhee) howe I became priſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to the Heardmen, where the vnhappy bewty with whiche I am indewed, forced <hi>Thyamis</hi> to Loue me: and it is to be feared leaſt if he finde vs, as we make inquiry, and ſée me, remembringe that I am ſhée who dalied and draue of with diuerſe diſceiptfull promiſes, the Mariage whiche he meante to make with me, that he wil take me, and by force compell me to finiſhe the ſame.

But for all that, why cannot you inuent ſome deuiſe to delude that whiche you ſtande ſo in doubte of? for you are very diligent, and crafty alſo to make ſhiftes and delaies againſt them, that ſéeke to haue you. <hi>Cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clia</hi> was ſommewhat mery with theſe woordes, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweared, whether you ſpeake this in earneſt or in ieſte

lette it paſſe for this time. But I will tell you the waye that <hi>Theagenes</hi> and I deuiſed, but Fortune woulde not let vs put it in practiſe becauſe it was very good. For when neceſſitie forced vs to leaue the Iland of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Heard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, it pleaſed vs to change our apparell, and wander aboute in the Villages, and good Townes ragged like beggers. Wherfore if it pleaſe you, lette vs counterfeite this habite and playe the beggers, ſo ſhall wée not be ſo<note place="margin">The commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of beggery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Pouertie is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pitied, then enuied.

For in ſuche a caſe by pouerty wée ſhalbe more ſafe: for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly it is rather pittied then enuied, and thus ſhal wée gette our dayly ſuſtenaunce more eaſily. For al thinges are more déerely ſolde to Straungers whiche haue néede to buie and knowe not the manner of the Country, but will be fréely geuen to ſuche as begge. <hi>Calaſiris</hi> praiſed her deuiſe, &amp; made haſte to be gonne: therefore the nexte day after they came to <hi>Nauſicles</hi> and <hi>Cnemon,</hi> and tolde them when thy were determined to departe, thei ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde (but tooke no Horſe with them, though one were profered them) nor ſuffered any man to beare them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, ſaue that <hi>Nauſicles</hi> and <hi>Cnemon,</hi> and the reſte of the houſe broughte them on theire waye. <hi>Nauſiclia</hi> alſo wente with them, crauinge ſo muche of her Father, for that the Loue ſhée bare to <hi>Cariclia,</hi> was more then her late Marriage permitted. And when they had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied them almoſt thrée quarters of a mile, eche one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordinge to their kinde, tooke theire laſte leaue and fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel and ſhooke handes, and after thei had ſhedde a great many of teares, and prayed that the partinge mighte be lucky to them, and <hi>Cnemon</hi> craued pardon, for that he wente not with them, by reaſon of his newe Mariage, and had tolde them that if he coulde gette occaſion he would followe them, they lefte either other, and theſe wente to <hi>Chemmis,</hi> but <hi>Calaſiris</hi> &amp; <hi>Cariclia,</hi> turned them ſelues into beggers habite, and put on ſuche ill fauoured clowtes as they had prouided before for that pourpoſe.
<pb facs="tcp:6393:89"/>
This donne, <hi>Cariclia</hi> defowled her face with durte, and ſoote, and tied a parte of her Faſcia that was foule about her heade, fufferinge it to hange ilfauouredly ouer her eies in ſtéede of a Bonnegrace: ſhée had moreouer a ſcrip vnder her arme, as though ſhée would put péeces of bread and broken meate therein, but in déede to carry the holy Veſture whiche ſhée brought from <hi>Delphi,</hi> her Crowne and the reſte of the remembraunces whiche her Mother layde foorthe with her. <hi>Calaſiris</hi> carried <hi>Cariclias</hi> quiuer wrapped in a torne and naughty péece of leather, the wronge ende downe warde on his ſhoulders, as if it had benne ſome other thinge, and he vſed her Bowe (whiche as ſoone as it was vnbent ſtoode very ſtraight) for a ſtaffe leaninge very heauily thereon: and if happily they mette any man, of pourpoſe he would make his backe more cro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked then his age required, and be lame of one legge, and ſometime be ledde of <hi>Cariclia</hi> by the hande. When they could play this parte well, and had ieſted one at another, and beſought the God that had their affaires in charge, that he would be content with that whiche was paſt, and ſuffer their euill lucke to procéede no farther, they went to Beſſa, where hopinge to finde <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Thya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis,</hi> they failed of theire pourpoſe: for comminge neare to Beſſa aboute the Sunne ſettinge, they behelde a great ſlaughter of men lately made, of whom the moſte were <hi>Perſians,</hi> which might eaſily be knowen by their armour, and a fewe of thoſe that dwelled there alſo: ſo that they might coniecture that there had benne a battaile, but thei knew not what y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> parties were that had foughten it: vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til at length by raunginge about the deade bodies, &amp; loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge if perhaps any of their friendes were there ſlaine:<note place="margin">Feare maketh menne iudge the worſte.</note> (for hartes whiche be in feare, and careful for that they loue beſte, oftentimes doo déeme the woorſte.) At laſte they ſawe an Olde wooman whiche laie vpon a deade body of one of thoſe Countrie men, and wayled woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully. They determined therefore if they mighte, to

enquire ſommewhat of her: and ſo comminge to her, at the firſte wente aboute to comforte her, and appeaſe her greate ſorrowe. Whiche when ſhée accepted, they aſked for whom ſhée lamented, and what Battaile had benne there: <hi>Calaſiris</hi> talkinge to her in the <hi>Egyptian</hi> tongue, ſhée tolde them al in fewe woordes, that ſhée ſorrowed for her Sonne, and came of pourpoſe to thoſe deade bodyes, that ſomme armed man mighte runne on her, and kill her, and in the meane time ſhée woulde doo ſuche Kites to her Sonne, as ſhée was hable with teares &amp; lame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. As touching the battaile ſhée told them thus: There was a ſtrange yonge man carried to <hi>Memphis,</hi> of goodly ſtature, and excellente bewtie to <hi>Oroondates</hi> the greate<note place="margin">A great bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taile aboute Theagenes to reſeue him fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Mytranes.</note> Kinges Deputie, he was ſente from <hi>Mytranes</hi> the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine of the Watches for a great Preſent, as they ſaide: him did our men that dwel in this Towne (ſhewing the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a Towne harde by) ſaie, was theirs: whether it were ſo in déede, or they made it a colour for them, I knowe not. When <hi>Mytranes</hi> hearde this, beinge angry (and good cauſe why) he conducted his Army hither twoo daies a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, and the people of this Towne are very warlike, and liue euer by ſpoylinge, and ſette not a ſtrawe by Deathe, and haue therefore taken from me, as wel as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther woomen at other times our Huſbandes and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

All the Cittie of <hi>Memphis</hi> was troubled with theſe woordes. When they knewe <hi>Thiamis,</hi> and the cauſe of his banniſhmente, whiche when he was banniſhed, none of them knewe, and denied al that he had ſaide to be trewe: but <hi>Arſace</hi> of al other was moſte troubled, ſo that a whole ſtorme of thoughtes in a manner ouerwhelmed her, for ſhée was ſoare incenſed againſte <hi>Petoſiris,</hi> and callinge to minde that whiche was paſte, deuiſed with her ſelfe howe ſhée mighte be reuenged.

nowe brought as well al the people of <hi>Beſſa,</hi> as alſo your<note place="margin">Arſace dothe anſweare This amis.</note> ſelues beinge youthfull yonge menne, and therewithall bewtifull, &amp; of good parentage (as may be gheaſſed) into apparent perill for the Théeues quarrell, in as muche as if wée woulde fight with you, you were not hable to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the firſte aſſaulte of our force. For the greate Kinges eſtate is not brought to ſo lowe an ebbe, but that you may be incloſed of the leauinges of the Army, which is behinde him in the Cittie (though the Deputie him ſelfe be away) but in mine opinion the whole powers on bothe ſides néede not to be troubled, and it is better, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge that the quarrell is priuate and not common, that it be priuately ended, and ſo be finiſhed as the Goddes ſhal appointe.

When <hi>Arſace</hi> had ſaide thus, al the <hi>Memphites</hi> ſhouted woonderſfirisly and praiſed her aduiſe, for that they beganne to ſuſpect the miſchieuous attempt of <hi>Petoſiris,</hi> and euery man was gladde to laie the imminent and preſent daunger, whiche was before their eies, on an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans backe. But the people of <hi>Beſſa</hi> were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with that order, neither woulde they venture their Captaine ſo daungerouſly, vntill <hi>Thyamis</hi> perſwaded them, telling them that <hi>Petoſiris</hi> was but féeble, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkilful to fight, and that he ſhoulde haue a greate aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the Battaile by reaſon of his practiſe. So thought <hi>Arſace</hi> alſo as may be déemed, and therfore ordained the battaile to be betwéene them twoo, that ſhée mighte haue her deſire without ſuſpicion, and be reuenged of <hi>Petoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> ſufficiently, if he fought with his Brother <hi>Thyamis,</hi> who was the better man a greate deale. There a man might ſée that donne, as ſoone as ſhée had commaunded it, and <hi>Thyamis</hi> with all his might haſted to doo what ſhée
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:6393:94"/>
had denounced, and tooke the reſte of his Armoure that he wanted, with a chéerefull countenaunce, and <hi>Theage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> comforted him diuerſly, and ſette on his head piece, wherein was a very fayre plume of feathers, gliſteringe by reaſon it was well gilted, and faſtened the reſt of his Armour ſurely about him. But <hi>Petoſiris</hi> was thruſt out of the gates by violence, to fulfill that whiche was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, though he vſed many prayers to intreate that he might not fight, and he tooke weapons in hande ſore againſt his will. When <hi>Thyamis</hi> ſawe him, he ſaide, doo you not ſée good <hi>Theagenes,</hi> how <hi>Petoſiris</hi> quaketh for feare? I ſee it well anſweared he: but how will you doo with this you haue taken in hande? for he is not a plaine enimy, but your naturall Brother, that you muſte fight with all.

He anſweared: there is no doubte of this battaile ſo that it maye be deſpiſed: yet for as muche as the varietie of humayne Fortune, bringeth many thinges to paſſe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trary to our exſpectation oftentimes, if I gette the victory you ſhal enter into the Cittie, and liue in equall authoritie with me, but if any thinge o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe then wée hope for, happen to me, then ſhal you be Captaine of theſe Robbers of <hi>Beſſa,</hi> who loue you well, and ſo liue vntill God haue appointed ſome better ende for your affayres.

But emonge al the reſte, <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Cariclia</hi> whiche plaied the Louers partes in this Comedie, were moſte talked of, and for that they had founde eche other, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to theire hope, made the Cittie to looke vpon them more then al other ſightes whiche were there to be ſéene: for great companies of euery age came out at the Gates into the open fieldes, &amp; ſuche as were youthful, &amp; newely comme to mannes eſtate, came to <hi>Theagenes:</hi> ſuche as were of riper yéeres, menne growen in déede, drewe to <hi>Thiamis,</hi> for that they alſo by reaſon of their age knewe him wel: but the Maydenly ſorte, who now thought vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Huſbandes, flocked aboute <hi>Cariclia:</hi> but the Old menne, and ſuche as were of the Holyer kinde, ſtoode aboute <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſiris:</hi> and thus was there made a ſuddaine Sacred Pompe and brauerye. After <hi>Thiamis</hi> had ſente backe the people of <hi>Beſſa,</hi> &amp; geuen them thankes for the paines they tooke in his quarrel, with promiſe that at the nexte full Moone he woulde ſende them a thouſande Oxen, a thouſande Shéepe, and tenne groates a péece in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, he ſuffered his Father as he went, for eaſe, to leane vpon his ſhoulders, who nowe for his ſuddaine ioie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganne to ware féeble, and very fainte. <hi>Petoſiris</hi> did the like on the other ſide: &amp; thus was the Olde man brought into <hi>Iſis</hi> Temple with Tapers lighted, and with greate ioie, and many Inſtrumentes of Muſike, ſo that the luſty youthes beganne alſo to daunce. Beſide theſe, <hi>Arſace</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo was not behinde, but with her traine folowed in braue wiſe, and offered greate giftes of Golde in <hi>Iſis</hi> Temple, vnder pretence to doo as other did in the Cittie, but in déede her eies were alwaies vpon <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and ſhée looked more on him then any other, and was not very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly minded towarde him. And when <hi>Theagenes</hi> ledde <hi>Cariclia</hi> by the hande, and put the thruſt aſide that ſhée might take no harme, <hi>Arſace</hi> conceiued a woonderful Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie. But <hi>Calaſiris</hi> after he came into the inner parte
<pb facs="tcp:6393:97"/>
of the Temple, fell vpon his face, and helde the féete of the Image faſt, and laie ſo, ſo longe that he was almoſte deade: ſo that he had muche adoo to riſe when they called vpon him, who ſtoode by. And when he had donne Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to the Goddes, and perfourmed his vowes, takinge the Crowne of the Prieſthoode from his owne heade, he Crowned therewith his Sonne <hi>Thiamis,</hi> tellinge the<note place="margin">Calaſiris ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth his Sonne Thiamis Prieſte.</note> people that he was Olde, and ſawe that he ſhoulde not liue longe, and that his eldeſt Sonne ought to ſuccéede him by the Lawe, and that he had all thinges requiſite, bothe to body and minde, ſufficient to vſe the ſame. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the people had by a greate ſhoute declared, that they approued y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> whiche he did, he wente him ſelf to a certaine parte of the Church, which is appointed for the Prieſtes, and remained there with his Sonnes, and <hi>Theagenes</hi> quickly.

Theſe woordes, and many moe like theſe, did this Olde queane ſpeake, vſinge diuers flatteringe faſſhions, more to make her confeſſe her paine, who after ſhée had ſtaied a while, ſaide thus: I am ſoarer wounded nowe Mother, then euer I was before, and for that I haue vſed your readye healpe many times in like caſes: yet I doubte whether nowe you ſhal haue ſuche like happy ſucceſſe. The Battaile whiche this daie was like to haue benne foughten before the Walles, to al other men was vnbloudy, &amp; concluded in peace: but to me it is the beginning of a woorſe warre, who haue a wounde, whereby I am like to looſe, no one Lymme, or Member, but my witte, and ſenſes, becauſe it ſhewed vnto me in an ill time the ſtraunge yonge man, who in the time that the twoo Brothers foughte, ranne by <hi>Thiamis.</hi> You knowe wel yenough Mother, of whom I ſpake.

put in practiſe all manner of meanes, all Olde woomens deuiſes, and flatteringes, if you wil haue your ſcholer to liue, for there is none other way to kéepe me aliue but to enioye him. I know the yonge man well, ſaide the olde<note place="margin">A deſcription of Theagenes.</note> wooman: he was broade breſted, and large betwéene the ſhoulders, ſtraight necked &amp; comely, taler then the reſte, and at a woorde to make an ende, he paſſed farre all other menne: his eies were a little fiery, ſo that he looked very louingly, and couragiouſly alſo, it was he whoſe heare was ſmothe commed, and had but a little yonge yellowe bearde: to whom a ſtraunge wooman, marry not fowle, but paſſinge impudent, as might be thought, ranne ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely and caſte her armes about him, &amp; helde him faſte and woulde not goe from him: Doo you not meane this man Miſtreſſe? Yes euen this, Mother anſweared ſhée, and you haue donne very well to bringe to my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance that impudent queane, who hath kepte her bewty ſecrete at home, &amp; painted her ſelfe, ſo that ſhée is prowde thereof, yet is ſhée but of the common ſorte, but ſure ſhée is muche more happy then I, that hath gotten ſuch a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. The Olde wooman ſmiled at this a litle, and ſaide: Miſtreſſe take a good harte, and be no longer ſorrowfull, the Stranger counteth her bewtiful but for this day, but if I can bringe it to paſſe that he haue the fruition of you and your bewtie, he will chaunge Golde for Braſſe, as the Prouerbe is, and ſette naught by the Harlotte which now maketh ſo muche of her ſelfe. If you doo this my déere <hi>Cibele</hi> (ꝙ ſhée) you ſhal heale twoo woundes in me at once, Ialouſie and Loue, deliueringe me of the one, and ſatiſfiynge me with the other.

ſmall cakes, and other thinges neceſſary to doo Sacrifice, and wente to Iſis Temple. When ſhée came to the doore, and ſaide that ſhée muſte doo Sacrifice for <hi>Arſace</hi> her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſe, who was troubled this nighte with certayne Dreames, and appeaſe the Goddes. One of the Sextens would not lette her in, but ſente her awaie, tellinge her that the Churche was full of ſorrowe: for that <hi>Calaſiris</hi> the Prieſte, after he came home from his longe iourney, made a ſumptuous feaſte, and endeuoured him ſelfe to be more merry and ioconde then euer he was, and after the feaſte Sacrificed, and made his earneſt prayers to the Goddes, and tolde his Sonnes that they had ſéene their Father till that time, and geuen them charge of twoo yange <hi>Greekes</hi> that came with him, that they ſhoulde doo what they were hable for them, wente to bedde.

And nowe haue wée ſente for the reſte of this Prieſtely crewe in the Cittie to doo his Deathe Rites accordinge to the Countrie manner. Wherefore you muſte nowe departe, for it is not lawful for any man to enter into the Temple, nor to kil any thinge theſe ſeuen daies, but for thoſe who are Prieſtes.

Wherefore tel them by <hi>Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amis</hi> Commaundemente that their Lodginge is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in our Palaice. The Sexten did ſo, ſuſpectinge no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſe, then that <hi>Cibele</hi> went aboute, but he thought that he ſhoulde doo the ſtraungers a greate pleaſure, if he by his meanes mighte procure theire Lodginge in the Princes Courte, and doo them, which requeſted the ſame, a good turne, without harme or peril to any. And when he came to <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Cariclia,</hi> who were very ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful, and wepte pitiefully, he ſaide: You doo not as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſéemeth you, nor as the Manners, and Ordinaunces of our Countrie beare, eſpecially ſéeinge you haue had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente that you ſhoulde not mourne.

But you deſerue pardon, who haue loſte, as you ſaie, a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a Patrone, and one, in whom was al your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte: yet ought you not altogeather deſpaire, for <hi>Thia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis</hi> (as is to be ſéene) hath ſuccéeded him, not onely in the Office of Prieſtehoode, but in good wil towarde you alſo, and hath geuen eſpecial charge for your welfare.

Therefore folowe this wooman (ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>winge them <hi>Cibele</hi>) and make accoumpte of her, as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to you bothe, and be contente with her entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente.<note place="margin">Theagenes and Cariclia, are conueyed into Arſaces houſe, by Cibeles craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty meanes.</note> Thus muche ſaide he: and <hi>Theagenes</hi> did ſo, either for that he was ouerwhelmed with the ſkorne of thoſe thinges, which happed to him contrary to his hope, or els for that in ſuche cauſe he was contente to take any lodginge in good parte. I thinke he would haue taken héede to him ſelfe, if he had ſuſpected what tragicall, and

intollerable thinges, that lodginge woulde haue procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them, to their great harme. But then the Fortune whiche gouerned their affayres, when it had refreſhed them well a fewe howers, and geuen them leaue to be merry one daie, ſuddainely ioyued thereto heauy and terrible thinges, and brought them into their enimies hande, in manner as if they ſhoulde haue yéelded them ſelues to be bounde. Makinge them pryſoners vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of courteous intertainement, without any know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that whiche ſhoulde happe to them afterwarde.

I know not the Father that begotte me: him, who made me his Childe by Adoption, alas I haue betraied. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer I haue loſte him, who tooke charge of me, and hathe ſaued, and nouriſhed me hitherto, and the crewe of Prieſtes wil not ſuffer me to wéepe ouer his deade Body as is accuſtomably donne in Burialles. But ſure my Nourſe and Sauiour, I wil alſo call thée Father, though God ſaie nay, yet will I as I maie, and where I maye offer to thée of my teares &amp; doo they deathe rightes with my lockes. And therewith ſhée pulled of a great handful of her heare, but <hi>Theagenes</hi> appeaſed her, and helde her handes ſoftely, yet ſhée lamented neuertheleſſe, ſayinge: To what ende ſhal wée liue any longer? after what hope ſhal wée looke? He that conducted vs through ſtraunge Landes, was the ſtaie of our errour, and our guide into our Countrie, the knowledge of our Parentes, our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte in aduerſities, the eaſe of our ill Fortune, the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>core of al our affaires, <hi>Calaſiris</hi> is dead, and hath lefte vs twoo, a miſerable payre in a ſtraunge Lande, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge what is beſte to doo. Hereafter euery Iorney by Lande, euery viage by water through ignorance is cutte of: a graue and courteous, an olde &amp; wiſe heade, in déede
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:6393:101"/>
and is gonne, who neuer made ende to doo for vs. As ſhée in this, or ſuche like ſorte lamented, and <hi>Theagenes</hi> concealed his own griefe, the rather thereby to cauſe <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclias</hi> ſorrowe to abate, came <hi>Achemenes,</hi> and findinge the Gate locked, aſked of the Porter what adoo is here? And when he knewe it was his Mothers déede, he came neare the doores, and conſideringe of the cauſe therof in his minde, he hearde <hi>Cariclia</hi> lamente: and bowinge down him ſelfe, looked in by certaine riftes in the iointes of the doore, &amp; ſawe al that was donne. And then he aſked her that kepte the doore againe, who were within? Shée anſweared, that ſhée knewe of no more but that there were twoo ſtraungers, belike a man, and a mayde which his Mother broughte in a while agoe. Then he knéeled downe againe, to ſée if he mighte more perfitely knowe them. Of <hi>Cariclia</hi> he was neuer the neare, yet he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled at her excellente bewtie, and conſidered what a manner a one ſhée would be, if ſhée were not in ſuche ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowe,<note place="margin">Achemenes, Sonne of Cibele, falleth in Loue with Cariclia.</note> and heauineſſe, and with this woonderinge he pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uely fel in loue with her: but he thought he ſhould know <hi>Theagenes,</hi> if he coulde calle him to minde. While <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chemenes</hi> was thinkinge hereupon, <hi>Cibele</hi> returned af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhée had tolde al howe ſhée had handled her ſelfe about the yonge folkes, and called her oft vnhappy for her good Fortune, who had brought ſo much to paſſe by chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, as by ſixe hundred deuiſes, one would ſcante haue thought, coulde be donne, that nowe ſhée mighte haue her Louer in the Houſe with her. And when ſhée had with many ſuche woordes ſette <hi>Arſace</hi> on fire, ſhée coulde ſcante rule her, ſhée was in ſuche haſte to ſée him: yet ſhée cauſed her to be contente, for that ſhée woulde not haue him ſée her while her eies were ſwolne for lacke of ſléepe, but a daye after, when ſhée had recouered her olde bewtie againe. Thus, when ſhée had made her merry, and ful of hope that ſhée ſhould haue her hartes deſire, and had taken or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with her what was beſte to doo, and howe ſhée ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:6393:102"/>
entertaine the ſtrau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers. As ſoone as ſhée came downe, ſhée ſaide to her Sonne, why be you ſo inquiſitiue: tel me what ſtraungers be thoſe within, and of what Countrie? It is not for you to know (ſaide <hi>Cibele</hi>): but conceale that whiche you knowe, and tel it to no man, neither be much emonge the ſtraungers, for ſo hathe our Miſtreſſe geuen charge. So he departed as his Mother badde him, and déemed that <hi>Theagenes</hi> was kept to ſerue <hi>Arſaces</hi> turne by nighte. And as he wente, he ſaide thus to him ſelfe: Is not this he, whom <hi>Mytranes</hi> Captaine of the Watch, deliuered to me, to be carried to <hi>Oroondates,</hi> and from him to be ſente to the greate Kinge, that the people of <hi>Beſſa</hi> tooke from me, at what time I was in daunger of my life, ſo that I almoſt alone of al that carried him, eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with my life? or doo mine eies beguile me. But I am wel yenoughe nowe, and ſée as I was woonte to doo. Moreouer I heare that <hi>Thiamis</hi> is comme a daie, or twoo agoe, and in a Combat with his Brother, recouered the Prieſtes Office againe. It is he, but I maie not ſaie ſo muche nowe, but wil marke howe our Miſtreſſe is affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted towarde theſe geaſtes. Thus he talked with him ſelfe: and <hi>Cibele</hi> wente in to them, and perceiued well what they had done, by reaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that their eies were yet ful of water, for al that they went aboute, when they heard the doore open, to trimme them ſelues, and counterfeited theire woonted guiſe. Wherfore ſhée cried out, and ſaide: My déere Children, why wéepe you out of ſeaſon, when ye ſhoulde reioice, and thanke your good Fortune, for that Arſace thinketh to doo al the good to you ſhée can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſe, and is contente, that to morrowe you ſhal comme into her preſence, and in the meane time ſhe weth you al manner of courteſie, and gentleneſſe. Wherefore you muſte leaue of theſe fooliſhe, and Childiſhe teares, and looke vp, and decke your ſelues, and in euery pointe doo as <hi>Arſace</hi> woulde haue you. The remembraunce of <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiris</hi> Deathe (ꝙ <hi>Theagenes</hi>) cauſed vs to wéepe, who haue

Within a while after came certaine <hi>Eunuches,</hi> whiche<note place="margin">Theagenes and Cariclia, were ſerued very cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſly at the firſte, but their ſweete meate had ſower ſauce in the ende.

They, leaſt they ſhoulde not doo their dutie, taſted a little of that which was ſette before them, and this was donne at night, &amp; ordinarily euery daie after. The nexte daie aboute one a clocke, the ſame <hi>Eunuches</hi> came to <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and ſaide: Right happy man, our Miſtreſſe hath ſente for you, and wée are commaunded to bringe you to her preſence: Wherefore goe and enioye that happineſſe, which ſhée voutchſaueth to very fewe, and at ſeldome times. He ſtaied a while, but at length as if he had bene violently drawen, he roſe againſt his wil, and ſaide vnto them: is her commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente that you bringe me alone, or that this my Siſter ſhal goe with me alſo? You muſt goe alone, ſaide they, &amp; ſhée ſhall goe alone alſo another time: Mary nowe there are certaine noble men of <hi>Perſia</hi> with her, and it is a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome to talke with men by them ſelues, &amp; with woomen

Shée anſweared him, that there was no gaineſayinge, but that he muſte goe and make ſuche countenaunce, as if he woulde doo all her will: This donne he followed them, and when they taught him howe he ſhould ſpeake to her, and that it was the cuſtome that ſuch as went in to her, ſhould fal downe and woorſhippe her, he gaue them no anſweare. When he came in and ſawe her ſittinge in her Chaire of Eſtate, clothed in Purple and clothe of Golde, glorious with iolly Iewelles, and her coſtly Bonnet, finely attired and decked, with her Garde aboute her, and the chiefe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates of the <hi>Perſians</hi> by her, he was not abaſhed a whit but rather the more incouraged againſt the <hi>Perſian</hi> bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie, as though he had quite forgotten that, whereof he talked with <hi>Cariclia</hi> as touchinge Reuerence, and woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippinge, ſo that he neither bowed knée, nor fell downe to her, but holdinge vp bis heade alofte, ſaide: <hi>Arſace</hi> of Royall bloude, God ſaue thée: whereat when thoſe who were preſente, were offended, and grudged againſt him as one raſhe and ouerbolde, in that he had not woorſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped her, <hi>Arſace</hi> ſmiled a little, and anſweared for him thus: pardon him as one ignorant of our cuſtomes, and a ſtraunger borne in <hi>Greece,</hi> who by reaſon of the ſoyle deſpiſeth our pompe: and therewithall ſhée put of her Bonnette, ſore againſte their willes that ſtoode by, for ſo doo the <hi>Perſians,</hi> to render Salute to thoſe who firſte ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted them. And when ſhée had bidden him to be of good chéere, by an interpreter (for although ſhée vnderſtoode, yet could ſhée not ſpeake the <hi>Greeke</hi> tongue) and willed him to ſpeake if he wanted any thinge, and he ſhoulde haue it. Shée ſent him backe againe, commaundinge her <hi>Eunuches,</hi> and Garde to wayte vpon him: there <hi>Ache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes</hi> ſeing him againe, called him better to his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braunce, for al that he iudged the cauſe of the ouer greate

Shée deſired <hi>Cibele</hi> hartely to make haſte and out of hande to doo what ſhée entended, becauſe ſhée coulde tarry no longer, who before lefte no waie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearched, but tried <hi>Theagenes</hi> minde by all manner of meanes: Marry ſhée did not tell him <hi>Arſaces</hi> minde plainely, but by diuerſe biewaies and circumſtaunces ſhée meante to make him vnderſtande the ſame, by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge him her Miſtreſſe good will to him, not onely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendinge her ſhape and bewty that all menne ſawe, but ſhée tolde him alſo of that whiche was vnder her Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, by certaine reaſonable occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, then praiſed ſhée her manners, for that thei were amiable, and nothing coye, &amp; that ſhée had greate delighte in fine, and hable yonge menne. The drifte of al her talke was to perceiue if he had any pleaſure in <hi>Venus</hi> diſportes. <hi>Theagenes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended her good will that ſhée bare to the <hi>Greekes,</hi> and her friendely faſhion, and els what ſo euer ſhée talked of, and further for the ſame gaue her hartie thankes: but he paſſed ouer that which conteined any diſhoneſt thing, as thoughe he vnderſtoode it not at the firſte. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Olde wooman was ſoare grieued, and nipped at the harte, for that ſhée thoughte he vnderſtoode what ſhée meante, but vtterly deſpiſed, and ſette at naughte al that ſhée did: ſhée knewe moreouer that <hi>Arſace</hi> woulde abide no longer, but beganne euen now to be angry, and tell her plainely ſhée coulde not rule her ſelfe: wherefore

For that pourpoſe ſhée ſent him coſtly Apparell, a Chaine and Bracelettes of Golde, and other ritche Iewelles: parte whereof willingely, parte againſte his will he putte on. And when <hi>Achemenes</hi> beganne to teache him howe he ſhoulde ſerue her the Cuppe, he ranne to a Table by, whereon ſtoode muche Plate, and takinge a Pretious Glaſſe in his hande, ſaide: I néede not to be taughte, but I wil of mine owne heade ſerue my Miſtres, without<note place="margin">Theagenes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth Acheme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes a cruell nippe.</note> ſuche curioſitie in theſe ſo eaſie matters.

On the other ſide <hi>Achemenes</hi> was offended too, &amp; moued, as wel with Anger, as Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſo that <hi>Arſace</hi> perceiued it, for that he ſo ſcorne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully looked vpon him, and whiſpered ſommewhat to thoſe whiche ſtoode by.

priuie then wée, who by too péeuiſhe reaſon doo kéepe his Counſell, and healpe him therein, but this ought by no meanes to be ſuffered, that he ſhoulde vſe vs, who are Seruitours, and his companions in the waie of honeſty in ſuch ſorte, without checke or taunte: but wée wil finde an other time to talke of theſe matters. Now Mother I would faine ſée my wife <hi>Cariclia,</hi> if by lookinge vpon her I maie ſomewhat abate this griefe of my minde.

For although we ſette more by her, then our owne eaſe, and preferred her deſire before our owne liues, in doinge all that wée coulde to pleaſure her.

Onely healpe me to prolonge the ſame for a while, and if any man aſke for me, ſaie I am ſore ſicke in the Countrie. And dothe this Gentleman cal his Siſter his wife? as though it might not be vnderſtoode, that he doothe it for none other pourpoſe, but to diſanull that whiche was graunted me by promiſe, as though it were not his Siſter but his wife, if he imbrace, colle, and kiſſe her as now he doothe, yea although he lie with her, I and

Wherefore <hi>Cibele</hi> now turne euery ſtoane, deuiſe al maner of meanes, ſeinge you know that wée are brought into extremitie. And thinke ſithe I deſpaire of my ſelfe, that I will ſpare no other: For thou ſhalt haue the firſte co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>moditie that ariſeth of thy Sonnes attemptes, wherof how thou ſhouldeſt be ignoraunt, I cannot ſurmiſe. <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bele</hi> anſweared: as touchinge my Sonne, and my fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to you Miſtreſſe, you ſhall know in the ende that you are deceiued.

as a Miſtreſſe, but flatter him like a Seruaunt, whiche perhappes was well donne at the firſt, when wée déemed him to be of a weake and youthfull courage.

Wherefore this alſo with paine will doo that whiche before he was gently handled, he woulde not.

Shée anſweared againe: You are too pitifull as though a little payne wil not make him better aduiſed, and you with his little griefe ſhall haue al your deſire. But you néede not with your eies ſée what ſhalbe donne to him, but deliuer him to <hi>Euphrates</hi> and commaund him to pouniſhe him as it were for ſomme other offence, ſo ſhall you not ſée that<note place="margin">VVhat the eye ſeeth not, the harte rueth not.</note> whiche will put you to paine (for it is nothinge ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous to heare of an ill chance as with eies to ſée the ſame) &amp; if wée perceiue that he relente and chaunge his minde, wée may deliuer him from his paine. <hi>Arſace</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tente to be perſwaded, and ſente for <hi>Euphrates</hi> the chiefe <hi>Eunuche,</hi> and commaunded him to doo as they had deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.

had brought him meate priuely, as if ſhe had benne ſoary for his miſhap by reaſon of the acquaintaunce which ſhée had with him, but in déede to ſée if he relented any whitte for theſe paines, &amp; howe he was preſently minded. But he plaied the man a greate deale more, &amp; withſtoode them moſte of al then, &amp; ſuffered his Body to be afflicted: but by reaſon of his Chaſtitie, he tooke a lofty ſtomake to him, &amp; reioiced, &amp; gloried in that Fortune, becauſe though his greateſt parte was tormented, yet his beſte, &amp; moſte no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble parte was wel pleaſed, &amp; for that he now had occaſion to declare what good wil he bare to <hi>Cariclia.</hi> He thought it we<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t very wel with him, if ſhée might but know therof, and ſtil would cal her his ioie, his harte, and life. Which when <hi>Cibele</hi> ſawe, althoughe ſhée, contrarye to <hi>Arſaces</hi> minde (which was, that he ſhould be but litle pouniſhed, vntil he relented, and not tormented to Deathe) had broughte <hi>Euphrates</hi> woorde to augmente his pouniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mente, and ſo coulde preuaile no whitte, but was quite without hope, and ſhée beganne nowe by experience to perceiue in what miſeries he was: sommetimes ſhée was afraide of <hi>Oroondates,</hi> if <hi>Achemenes</hi> tolde him hereof: ſommetime leaſte <hi>Arſace,</hi> if her loue were perceiued, woulde kil her ſelfe, ſhée determined to labour contrary to al that was like to fall vpon her, and with ſomme paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinge miſchiefe, either to execute <hi>Arſaces</hi> pleaſure, and ſo to auoide her preſente perill, or els to take aware all that mighte make oughte againſte her, by killinge of them all. And in that minde ſhée went in to <hi>Arſace,</hi> and ſaide: Miſtreſſe, wée looſe our labour. For that obſtinate felowe relenteth no whitte, but is more wilful, and hath <hi>Cariclia</hi> alwaies in his mouthe, and comforteth him ſelfe with her name, as if it were the deareſt thinge in the worlde to him. Wherefore if it pleaſe you, let vs as the Prouerbe ſaithe, caſte our laſte Ancore, and ſéeke ſomme meanes to take her awaye, whiche is ſo greate a lette to vs. For if he ſhal knowe that ſhée is deade, it is like that
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:6393:114"/>
he wil chaunge his minde, when he ſhal be out of al hope of her loue. <hi>Arſace</hi> was ready to beleue her, for that through her woordes, the Ialouſie that ſhée was in a good while before, was nowe by anger increaſed, and ſaide: You geue me good counſel, I wil take vpon me to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de this ſtop to be remoued. Who wil doo your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maundemente in this pointe (ꝙ <hi>Cibele</hi>)? For althoughe you haue al thinges in your handes, yet the Lawes will not let you kil one without the iudgemente of the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> Magiſtrates. You ſhall haue néede therefore to take greate héede howe you accuſe the Mayde, and then it is doubteful whether wée ſhall be hable to proue that which wée laie to her charge. But if you ſhal thinke it good (for I am ready to doo any thing for your ſake) I wil diſpatch<note place="margin">Cibele goeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute to poyſon. Cariclia.</note> this matter with poyſon, and by meanes of a ſubtile Cuppe, ridde our Aduerſary of her life. <hi>Arſace</hi> allowed her deuiſe, and badde her put it in practiſe, and ſhée went aboute it foorthe withal. And when ſhée founde <hi>Cariclia</hi> wéepinge, and makinge greate moane, and did nothinge but deuiſe many waies to die (for by this time ſhée per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in what caſe <hi>Theagenes</hi> was, althoughe <hi>Cibele</hi> at the firſt had by diuers ſubtill meanes deluded her, and made ſundrye excuſes, for that ſhée ſawe him not as ſhée was woont to doo), ſhe ſaide: vnhappy Creature wilt thou not yet leaue to pine thy ſelfe, and conſume awaie to no pourpoſe? Beholde, <hi>Theagenes</hi> ſhal be ſette at libertye this nighte, and comme to thée, for our Miſtreſſe, who for a certaine offence that he committed in ſeruing her, was angred, &amp; commaunded him to Warde, &amp; hathe promiſed this day (partely at my requeſt) to ſet him at libertie, &amp; to celebrate a ſumptuous Feaſte accordinge to the cuſtome of this Countrie. Wherefore ariſe, and be mercy, and at lengthe yet eate ſommewhat with vs. Howe ſhould I beleue you (ſaide <hi>Cariclia</hi>)? For your continual lieinge hathe ſo ofte beguiled me, that I cannot geue credite to any thinge that you ſaie. Then ſaide <hi>Cibele,</hi> I ſweare
<pb facs="tcp:6393:115"/>
vnto you by al the Goddes, that al your buſineſſe ſhal be diſpatched this daie in ſuche ſorte, that you ſhall neuer néede to take more care hereafter, if you kil not your ſelfe before, by refraininge thus many daies without meate. Wherefore eate ſomme bitte of that whiche is prouided at this time. <hi>Cariclia</hi> was contente with muche adoo, neuertheleſſe ſhée doubted that ſhée woulde decieue her as oft as ſhée had donne before, but becauſe of her Othe ſhée partely agreed, and was gladde to take holde of that whiche was promiſed: for the minde dothe quickly geue<note place="margin">VVee ſoone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leue what wee woulde haue come to paſſe.

And as Aura ſerued the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of drinke, <hi>Cibele</hi> becked to her that ſhée ſhoulde bringe firſte to <hi>Cariclia</hi> the poyſoned Cuppe, and after her ſhée dranke her ſelfe of an other Cuppe. Shée had ſcante dronke it of, but ſhée beganne to ſwell, and was cruelly tormented within: wherfore ſhée powred out that which was lefte, on the grounde, and looked cruelly vpon the Mayde. <hi>Cariclia</hi> was abaſſhed, and ſoare troubled with this, and beganne to ſtaie her vprighte. So were al the reſte that were there. For a Cuppe impoyſoned is ſwif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then any Arrowe, and is of force ſufficiente to kill one that is yonge and luſtie. But then when it was in an Olde, and drie Body, it creapte into the principall partes of her, ſooner then any man coulde tell the tale. Thus was the Olde wooman conſumed, and all her members were with the pinchinge of the Poyſon diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and quite without life, and all her Body was very blacke. But verily I thinke that her crafty minde was more miſcheiuous, then the Poyſon was, in as muche as <hi>Cibele</hi> now yéelding vp her Ghoſte, foregot not her ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till deuiſes, but partely by Signes, partely by vnperfite woordes, and dieinge ſpeache, ſhée ſignified that <hi>Cariclia</hi> was ſhée who had poyſoned her. So the Olde wooman died, and <hi>Cariclia</hi> was bounde, and broughte ſtraighte waie to Arſace, who aſked her, whether ſhée had prouided
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:6393:115"/>
that Poyſon, and threatened to tormente her on the Racke, if ſhée would not confeſſe the trothe. Nowe was <hi>Cariclia</hi> a ſtraunge ſight to thoſe that looked vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, for ſhée was not ſadde, nor bare any cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tenance that might argue a fainte harte, but came ſmilinge before her, and made an accompt of that ſhée had in hande, either for that ſhée paſſed not of that ſlaunder becauſe ſhée was giltleſſe, or els for that if <hi>Theagenes</hi> were not aliue, ſhée woulde alſo die, and eſtéemed it a vantage to take vpon her a déede whiche other menne had donne. And ſaide: Iolly Dame, if <hi>Theagenes</hi> be aliue, I ſaie that I am not guilty of this murther. But if he haue miſcarried through thy miſchieuous attemptes, thou ſhalte néede no tormentes to make me confeſſe the facte. I am ſhée who hath killed thy Nourſe, that hath brought thée vp ſo wel, and taught thée ſo muche good, kill me out of hande: for I coulde doo <hi>Theagenes</hi> no greater pleaſure, who by good right hath reſiſted thy wicked deuiſes. Theſe woordes made <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſace</hi> madde, and when ſhée had commaunded her to be beaten, ſhée ſaide carry this queane away bounde as ſhée is, &amp; ſhewe her to her goodly Louer, who is in like plite, and when you haue bounde her hande and foote, commit her to <hi>Euphrates</hi> alſo to be kepte vntill to morrowe, to be condemned to deathe by the <hi>Perſian</hi> Magiſtrates. As ſhée was ledde away, the Mayde who was <hi>Cibeles</hi> cuppe bearer (ſhée was one of the <hi>Ionians,</hi> whiche at the firſte was willed to waite vpon them) whither it were for good will whiche ſhée bare to <hi>Cariclia,</hi> by reaſon of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintaunce and familiarity whiche ſhée had with her, or moued by the wil of God, wepte and lamented pitifully, &amp; ſaide: <hi>ô</hi> vnhappy wooman whiche is without al faulte.

So ſhee was carried forthwith to <hi>Arſace,</hi> and was very gladde if <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclia</hi> mighte be excuſed of this facte, for euen the very Barbarous people haue pittie vpon a Gentle and Noble countenaunce. And although the Mayde ſaide the ſame to her, yet ſhée preuailed nothinge, but <hi>Arſace</hi> commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded her alſo, as helpinge and conſentinge thereto, to be put in priſon, and kepte to Iudgement. The <hi>Perſian</hi> Magiſtrates in whoſe handes it was to determine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſies, and puniſhe offences as touchinge the weale publike, were ſente for in haſte to ſitte in iudgement the nexte daie.

foorthe with her, whiche ſhée was euer accuſtomably wonte to beare priuily of pourpoſe, and tied them at that time about her in a bagge, to the intent that they ſhould furniſhe her Buriall, ſhée confeſſed euery accuſation that was laide againſte her, and refuſed no manner of death, and rehearſed her ſelfe many thinges alſo, whereof ſhée was not accuſed. Wherefore the Iudges made no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laie, but had almoſte adiudged her to a more cruell and Perſianlike deathe, yet becauſe they were moued with her countenaunce a little, and yonge ſurpaſſinge bewty,<note place="margin">Cariclia is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to the fire.</note> they condemned her to be burned with fire. Then was ſhée had awaie preſently with the Executioners, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried a little without the Cittie, al the while ſhée was lead foorthe, one made a crie, that ſhée ſhould die for poiſoning one, wherefore a great company more followed them out of the Cittie. Some whereof ſawe her as ſhée was lead, other hearde thereof by reporte, whiche quickely flewe ouer al the Cittie, and ſo haſted thereto. <hi>Arſace</hi> came alſo, and ſawe that whiche happened from the walle: for ſhée thought it a paine, if ſhée ſatiſfied not her ſelfe, with ſéeinge her die. When the Executioners had laide a greate deale of woode togeather, &amp; put fire thereto, that now it beganne to flame, <hi>Cariclia</hi> praied them who lead her, to geue her a little leaue, &amp; promiſed that ſhée would goe into the fire alone, whiche graunted, ſhée ſaide with a lowde voice: <hi>ô</hi> Sunne, and Earthe, and all you bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed<note place="margin">Cariclies prayer.</note> Creatures, that are aboue and vnder the Earthe, whiche ſée and take reuenge of all wicked woorkers.

And in all haſte take reuenge of this ſhameleſſe <hi>Arſace,</hi> who hath defiled her ſelfe with ſo many filthie factes, and is a Harlotte, and dothe all this to robbe me of my Huſbande.

to that ſhée had ſpoken: wherefore ſome woulde haue the Executio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſtaied til an other time of iudgement, and ſomme were ready to take her awaie: ſhée preuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinge them all, wente into the middeſt of the fire, and ſtoode there a good while without harme, &amp; the fire wente<note place="margin">The fire woulde not touche Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riclia.</note> euery waye aboute her, and woulde not approche néere her, ſo it hurte her not, but gaue place when ſhée came thereinto, by meanes whereof ſhée was with the lighte that was aboute her, made fayrer, and woondred at the more, by reaſon of her bewty, ſo that in a manner ſhée was married in a firy chamber. Shée wente ſometime into this ſide, ſometime into that, maruelinge what it meante, and haſted to be deade, but it preuailed not, for that the fire alwaie gaue place, and as it were fledde fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her: the Tormentours ceaſed not but layde on more woode and réede (<hi>Arſace</hi> with threatninge countenance charginge them ſo to doo) to make it burne more vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently: But it did no good, ſaue that it troubled the Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie more, whiche ſuppoſinge that ſhée had healpe from Heauen, cried out the wooman is cleane, the wooman is not guiltie, wherefore they came to the fire, and put aſide the Tormentours. The firſte that ſo did, was <hi>Thiamis</hi> (for by this time he was comme, beinge admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed of that whiche was donne, by the greate brute in the Cittie) and he encouraged the people to healpe her, and beinge in wil to deliuer her, they durſte not comme neare the fire, but willed her to comme foorthe. For ſhée that had benne in the fire without harme, if ſhée liſte to comme out thereof, néede feare nothinge.

Wherewith the people, what for ioie, and woonder gaue a greate ſhoute, and thanked the Goddes for the ſame. But <hi>Arſace</hi> not wel in her wittes, ſkipte from the walles, and came out at a Poſterne with

See<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge that in your ſo healpinge ſuche a wicked queane, you ſtriue againſte the Lawes of <hi>Perſia,</hi> and againſte the Kinge him ſelfe, his Deputies, Nobles, and Iudges al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Perhappes you be deceiued, for that ſhée burned not this daye, and therefore you aſcribe that hap to the Gods. Wil you not be wiſer, and vnderſtande that this is a greater proufe of her Witchcraft, who hathe ſuch ſloare of ſleightes, that ſhee can withſtande the ſtrengthe of the fire? Comme you to morrowe into the Councel houſe, if you wil, for it ſhalbe by al your conſentes: there ſhall you heare that ſhee will confeſſe the ſame, and ſhall be conuinced by ſuche of her felowes, as are priuie thereto, and I keepe in Priſon. And therewithal ſhée carried her awaie, holdinge her by the necke, and commaunded her Garde to make her roume. But ſomme of them were angry, and in minde to withſtande: other gaue ouer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were ſomewhat blinded with the tale of poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoninge, but moſte for feare of <hi>Arſace,</hi> and her authority. Then was <hi>Cariclia</hi> deliuered to <hi>Euphrates</hi> againe to be kepte to a newe Iudgemente, and had more yrons laide vpon her. The greateſt comforte that ſhée had in this aduerſitie, was that ſhée had time to telle <hi>Theagenes</hi> of her affayres, for this was <hi>Arſaces</hi> inuention too, to put them to the more paine, that the yonge Creatures beinge in one place priſoners, might behold either others<note place="margin">A Louer is more greeued at his friendes harme then his owne.</note> tormentes, and griefes, for ſhée knewe wel yenough that a Louer is more grieued at his friendes paine, then his owne diſeaſe. But they coumpted this a comforte, and to be pained alike they thoughte it a vauntage, and if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther had leſſe torme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes then the other, eche ſuppoſed him

For nowe was it lawful for them to be togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, &amp; encourage eche other to take in goodly wiſe what fortune ſo euer came, and refuſe no perill whiche ſhoulde enſue of their vnfained Chaſtitie, and ſtedfaſte Faithe. After they had continued their talke of ſuch matters, as is likely they woulde talke of (who neuer hoped to talke togeather againe) til it was night, and had ſatiſfied them ſelues as wel as they mighte: at laſte they fell into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Myracle which happened about the fire. <hi>Theagenes</hi> referred the benefite therof to Gods goodnes, who had ſaued her being guiltleſſe from <hi>Arſaces</hi> vniuſte ſclaunder. But <hi>Cariclia</hi> ſéemed to doubte thereof. For (ꝙ ſhée) this ſtraunge kinde of deliuery maie be thought in déede to procéede of God. But ſtill to be afflicted with ſuche miſeries, and tormentes without al meaſure, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a token of thoſe who are plagued by God, and are like to fall into greater ineonueniences: excepte there be ſome more hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> miſtery which caſteth into extreame pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril, &amp; when al hope is paſte, findeth a remedy. When ſhée had ſaide thus, &amp; <hi>Theagenes</hi> willed her to take all in good parte, and be of a godlier minde, ſhée cried out alowd, the Goddes be fauourable to vs. Nowe I remember what a Dreame, or Viſion I had this laſte nighte, but had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten it before, I know not howe.

me, whether it were <hi>Calaſiris,</hi> or any other of the Gods in <hi>Calaſiris</hi> fourme, who ſéemed to ſaie thus to me:</p>

               <p>As for me I can wel gheaſſe wherto this Oracle te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deth. The Lande of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> ſéemeth to be that which is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the grounde. With the Mayde, that is to dwel with <hi>Proſerpina.</hi> And the eſcapinge of <hi>Arſaces</hi> bande, to be a Departure of the Soule from the Body. But what ſhould your Verſe meane, wherin is ſo many contraries? For <hi>Pantarbe</hi> ſignifieth al feareful, and yet it woulde not haue you be afraide of the fire. Then ſaide <hi>Cariclia:</hi> My déere harte <hi>Theagenes,</hi> our continual calamttie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth you take al of the woorſte. For commonly menne applie theire minde to that whiche accuſtomably happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. But I thinke that this anſweare ſéemeth to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhewe better lucke then you ſuppoſe. So that I perhaps ſhal be the Mayde, with whom you haue a promiſe that you ſhal recouer my Countrie <hi>Aethiopia:</hi> when you ſhal be deliuered out of <hi>Arſaces</hi> bandes. But howe that ſame ſhal be donne, wée knowe not, neither is it incredible, but it is poſſible for the Goddes to doo it, and let them ſée thereto who geue vs theſe anſweares: for as touchinge that whiche was foreſhewed of me, it is fulfilled as you your ſelfe knowe, and I liue of whom there was no hope at all, and I, who then carried mine owne ſaftie aboute me, was ignorante thereof: but nowe me thinkes I vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtande it. For whereas at all times before, I carried with me the tokens that my Mother laide foorthe with me. At that time, aboue al other, when I looked for my laſte Iudgemente, I priuily tied them aboute me, that if I were ſaued, they might finde me ſuch thinges as were neceſſary for me to liue by: but if I miſcarried, that they ſhoulde be my laſte Ornamentes, and dewe Furniture

to my Burial. Emonge theſe, <hi>Theagenes,</hi> whiche are Iewels of a greate valewe, and very Pretious Stoanes of <hi>India,</hi> and <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> there is a Ringe whiche my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gaue vnto my Mother, when he was enſured to her, wherein is ſet a ſtoane called <hi>Pantarbe,</hi> and aboute it are certaine holy Letters written, to be ſhorte that Ringe hath ſomme heauenly vertue whiche withſtandeth fire, geuinge them grace that haue the ſame, neuer to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damaged with it, whiche alſo perhappes by the will of the Goddes hath preſerued me. Thus maie I thinke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Calaſiris</hi> told me the ſame was written in my Faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia, wherein at this time is the reſte of my ſtuffe wrap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. This is probable and like to be trewe (ꝙ <hi>Theagenes</hi>) becauſe of your deliuery. But what other Pantarbe ſhal wée haue to ayde vs out of the nexte daies daunger? for the moſte wicked <hi>Arſace</hi> dothe not promiſe immortality for auoydinge the fire (whiche I woulde to God mighte happen) but deuiſeth in the meane time ſome other newe and ſtraunge pouniſhment. And I would to God that ſhée woulde condemne vs bothe at once to one kinde of death, verily I would not call that death, but a reſt from al our troubles. Be of good comforte, ꝙ <hi>Cariclia,</hi> we haue another <hi>Pantarbe,</hi> this promiſe which was made vs this night paſte, and if wée truſt in God, either wée ſhal haue more pleaſure if wée be ſaued, or die with better mindes if neede require.

When <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> came neare, and ſette to his handes to take away the ſtockes, whereunto their bandes were tied. <hi>Theage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> cried out: <hi>ô</hi> goodly <hi>Arſace,</hi> ſhée thinketh to hide her<note place="margin">The eye of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice doth bringe to lighte euill deedes, be they neuer ſo cloſely donne.</note> miſchieuous déedes by night and darkeneſſe, but the eye of Iuſtice is quicke to reproue, and will bringe to lighte all wicked déedes, be they neuer ſo cloſely and priuily donne: but doo you as you are commaunded, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Fire, Water, or Swoorde, that is appointed for vs, lette vs bothe togeather, and at one time, haue one manner of deathe. <hi>Cariclia</hi> made the ſame peticion too.

For he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped that <hi>Oroondates</hi> woulde accepte well of his paines, (whiche was a harde matter) if he coulde keepe the yonge man well, whoſe comelineſſe woulde ſtaine al the other Courtiers: and the Mayde of ſuche ſingulare bewtie, to be his wife after <hi>Arſaces</hi> deathe. <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and <hi>Cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clia</hi> were very gladde theſe newes &amp; thanked the mighty Goddes, and Iuſtice therefore. For then they thoughte they ſhoulde haue no more paine, though they had neuer<note place="margin">VVhat ſome would doo to be reuenged of theire enimies.</note> ſo ill lucke, ſéeinge that their mortall enimie was deade. So great a pleaſure haue ſomme thought it were to die, ſo that they mighte die with theire enimies deſtruction. When it drewe towarde nighte, and the heate beganne to abate, ſo that it was better to trauaile in, they ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde, and roade al that euening, and the night, and the nexte morninge, makinge the more haſte to take <hi>Oroon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates</hi> at <hi>Thebes,</hi> if they might, but they loſte their lobour. For after that one of the Hoſte met him, &amp; tolde him that the Deputie was not at <hi>Thebes,</hi> but that he was ſente to take vp al y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Souldiers that were in wages, though they were any where in Garriſon, &amp; bring them to <hi>Siene,</hi> whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he willed them to goe: for all was in trouble, and hurly burly, and it was to be doubted that the Citie was taken, by reaſon that the Deputie came too late, and the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> Army vſed ſuche celeritie, that it was there<note place="margin">Celerity is a principall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in warre.</note> before any newes came, that it was comminge. <hi>Bagoas</hi> leafte his intended iourney to <hi>Thebes,</hi> and wente to <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ene.</hi> And beinge nowe almoſte there, he fell into the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopian</hi> Scoute, a valiaunte crewe of luſty Souldiers, that were ſent before to ſpie the Countrie, that the great Army haue ſafe paſſaſſe, who at that time, as wel becauſe of the nighte, as alſo for that they were not very ſkilfull of the Countrie (for ſo they had commiſſion to laie theire Ambuſhment where ſo euer they ſawe any commodious

place) hidde them ſelues vnder certaine Buſhes for their owne defenſe, and the better to grieue their enimies too, and ſlepte not. Early in the morning, when thei hearde <hi>Bagoas,</hi> and the other Horſemenne ride by, and ſawe that they were but a fewe, they ſuffered them to ride on, and when they knewe certainely that none folowed them, they brake out with a greate noyſe, and purſued them. <hi>Bagoas,</hi> and the other Horſemenne that were with him, beinge amazed, as wel with their ſuddaine crie, as alſo for that they knewe them to be <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> by their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, and them ſelues not hable to withſtande the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (for they were a thouſande ſente to ſcanne the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, in lighte Harneis) tarried not ſo muche, as to looke them in the faces, but fledde, not ſo faſte at the firſte, as they mighte, becauſe they woulde not haue their enimies thinke that they would flée in haſte. Theſe chaſed them, and ſente out aboute twoo hundred of the people called <hi>Trogloditae.</hi> The <hi>Trogloditae</hi> are a people of <hi>Aethiopia</hi>
                  <note place="margin">VVhat people the Trogloditae are, and the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ners of their Countrie.</note> that liue in Huſbandrie.

They neuer weare heauy Armoure, but vſe Slinges in battaile, and ſuddainely inuade their enimies, and ſo indamage them. If they perceiue that they be too weake, they flée: theire enimies neuer purſue them, for that they knowe they are ouer ſwifte, and will hide them ſelues in euery corner. Thus theſe ouertooke the Horſemenne, beinge them ſelues on foote, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded them in caſting out of their Slinges. But when thei returned vpon them, they would not abide by it, but fled backe by litle and litle to their felowes: whiche when the <hi>Perſians</hi> perceiued, they deſpiſed them becauſe they were no moe: wherefore thei chaſed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as faſte as they might, and when they had folowed them a litle, then roade they forewarde againe with as muche ſpéede as they coulde, and ſpurred their Horſes, and gaue them all the Raines at will. By whiche meanes ſomme eſcaped, and fledde
<pb facs="tcp:6393:122"/>
vnto a Hill that ſtandeth by <hi>Nylus,</hi> vnder the which they couered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues that their enimies might not ſée them: But <hi>Bagoas</hi> was taken becauſe his Horſe ſtumbled, and he fel, and hurte his legge that he coulde not ſturre it. <hi>Theagenes</hi> alſo, and <hi>Cariclia</hi> were taken priſoners, who<note place="margin">Theagenes, and Cariclia are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken priſoners of the Aethiopian foreriders.</note> thought it ſhame to foreſake <hi>Bagoas,</hi> whoſe good wil they had tried towarde them already, and hoped to finde more at his hande afterwarde, and therefore tarried by him, partely for that they coulde not flée, but eſpecially as I thinke, willinge to yéelde them ſelues to them. Then <hi>Theagenes</hi> ſaide to <hi>Cariclia,</hi> Thus is our Dreame comme to paſſe: theſe be the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> in whoſe Land it is our Deſtinie to comme. I am determined therefore to yéelde to them, and commit our ſelues rather to doubtful For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune with them, then to preſente peril with <hi>Oroondates. Cariclia</hi> vnderſtoode al the matter, which was now ledde thereto by Deſtinye, as if ſhée had benne taken by the hande, and conceiued better hope in her minde, ſuppoſing thoſe who tooke them, rather to be theire friendes, then enimies, yet ſhée tolde nothing to <hi>Theagenes</hi> of that ſhée thought, but ſaid: ſhée was wel content. When the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians</hi> were comme to them, they knewe <hi>Bagoas</hi> to be an <hi>Eunuche</hi> by his face, but made further inquiry what theſe ſhoulde be, becauſe they ſawe them bounde, and without Harneys, of an <hi>Egyptian</hi> of theire owne compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and an other who coulde ſpeake the <hi>Perſian</hi> languge, thinkinge that they ſhoulde vnderſtande either bothe, or one of them at the leaſte. For Eſpialles, and Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riders are taught of neceſſitie to haue ſuch with them as can ſpeake the language of the Inhatauntes, and theire enimies, that they maye the better vnderſtande that, whereaboute they are ſente. After <hi>Theagenes,</hi> who by continuance of time had learned the <hi>Egyptian</hi> tongue a litle, and coulde anſweare to a ſhorte queſtion, had told them that he was the chiefeſt ſeruaunte aboute the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Deputy, and them ſelues <hi>Greekes,</hi> taken priſoners
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:6393:122"/>
firſt by the <hi>Perſians,</hi> but now through better Fortune of the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> they determined to ſaue their liues, and take them priſoners, and make a preſente of theire firſte praye to theire Kinge, of the chiefeſt Iuell his <hi>Perſian</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimie had. For <hi>Eunuches</hi> are in the Courtes of <hi>Perſia</hi>

And ſaide: Loo at the firſt the Goddes deliuer our enimies to vs in bandes, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge that theſe be the firſte pryſoners, they ſhalbe kepte to the ende of the warre, to be Sacrificed at our Triu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>phe to the Goddes, accordinge to the olde cuſtome of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians.</hi> After he had rewarded his Spies, he ſente them and the priſoners to their impedimentes, and ſette a company to kéepe them, whiche could well ſpeake their language, and gaue them ſtreight commaundement to looke well vnto them, and let them fare of the beſte, and kéepe them from al manner of vncleanneſſe, as thinges appointed for Sacrifice ought to be kepte, and that their bandes ſhould be chaunged, and haue Chaines of Golde for them.

truely Fortune flattereth vs woonderfully, wée chaunge Iron for Golde, and in pryſon wée are enritched, ſo that wée be more woorthe in our Bandes. <hi>Cariclia</hi> ſmiled too, and woulde haue him of an other minde, and therefore brought him in remembrance of that whiche the Goddes had foreſhewed vnto them, and ſo put him into better hope. But <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> him ſelfe aſſaulted <hi>Siene,</hi> and where as he thought before, that with his greate Hoſte at the firſte approche he ſhould haue ouerthrowen the Towne, Walles &amp; all, he had almoſt benne then repulſed of them that kepte the ſame, who dallied not, but valiantly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode their enimies force, and railed on them ſpitefully, to anger them the more. He very wrothe that they were fully determined to indure to the ende, and had not ſtraighte yéelded them ſelues to him, thought it good not to trifle the time with his Army, and doo nothinge, nor to laie ſuche a ſiege whereby ſomme mighte eſcape, and ſomme be taken, but vtterly in ſhorte ſpace to ſpoyle the Towne. Wherefore he diuiſed ſuche a piece of woorke, he parted the compaſſe aboute the walles emonge his Souldiers, and to euery tenne men he appointed tenne yardes, the length, and bredth thereof was very greate, and commaunded them to make a Ditche: ſome digged, other carried the grytte away, and ſomme therewith did raiſe vp a Counter wall againſte that whiche was beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged. No man durſte comme out of the Towne, becauſe of the greate Army, to hinder, or let the woorke that it mighte not be made rounde about the Towne, and their Slinges, and other Engins ſerued to no pourpoſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſawe that the ſpace betwéene the twoo walles was ſo greate, that they who made the Ditche, were without their daunger. When they had ſoone diſpatched this, by reaſon of the greate number of the labourers, he beganne ſuch an other thinge. He lefte betwixte the twoo endes of the Ditche, the breadthe of one hundred foote whiche he ditched euen vnto <hi>Nylus,</hi> bringinge the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:6393:124"/>
ſtill from the lower grounde to that whiche was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and more harde. A man mighte haue likened that woorke to a longe wall, becauſe it kepte equally an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred foote in breadthe, and was ſo longe as the grounde whiche is betwéene <hi>Nylus</hi> and <hi>Siene.</hi> When he had brought this to the bankes of <hi>Nylus,</hi> he turned the water into his Riuer, which in falling from a higher place into that whiche is lower, and out of the woonderful breadth of <hi>Nylus</hi> into a narrowe Riuer wrought by hande, made a greate noyſe; as wel at the entry thereinto, as alſo in the Ditche when it was in, ſo that they mighte heare it, that were a greate waie of. Whiche when they who were in <hi>Siene</hi> ſawe, and vnderſtoode into what daunger they were broughte, becauſe he meante by ſo compaſſing them aboute, to drowne theire Towne, ſo that none of them mighte flée, for that they were ſo incloſed with the Walles as wel by Lande, as Water, and that they could not be aſſured: thoughe they aboade within they made a good ſhifte, as the time would ſuffer to ſaue them ſelues. Firſte, when the gates, and the boorde woorke aboute them failed, they laied vpon it Plaiſter, and Pitche to make it the ſurer, and they vnderpropped their walles that they might ſtande the ſtronger. Somme brought earth thereto, and ſome ſtoanes, many brought olde tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and euery man that whiche was next hande: no man was vnoccupied, but woomen and children, yea and Olde men too laboured harde. For daunger of deathe refuſed the ayde neither of any age, nor kinde. The ſturdier yonge menne, and thoſe that were in wages, were ſette to make a little Countermine that ſhoulde ſtretche to theire enimies Fortreſſe, the manner whereof was thus: They digged a Pitte almoſte fiue yardes righte downe harde by the wall, and there laied a ſure Foundation. Then digged they forewarde ſtraighte to their enemies Bulwarkes by Torche lighte, and thoſe that came after in order, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ueied the grytte from thoſe that went before,
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:6393:124"/>
and carried it into a certaine parte of the Cittie, where their Gardeins were. And this did they for this pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that if the water came into that place whiche was without earthe, it mighte haue a waie to breake out, and fall awaie. But this calamitie preuented the readineſſe of the Cittizens. For <hi>Nylus</hi> hauinge nowe paſſed the longe Ditche fell very faſte into the rounde Riuer, and flowinge euery where ouer the Bankes, drowned al the ſpace betwéene the twoo walles, and made it like a ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge Poole. And thus was <hi>Siene</hi> made an Ilande, and a Cittie whiche ſtandeth in the middeſt of a Countrie was compaſſed about with water, and beaten vpon ſoare with the waues of <hi>Nylus.</hi> The wall of the Towne with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoode the force of the water but one daie. But as ſoone as the water increaſed, and waxed hie, ſo that it ſonke into the grounde, by reaſon that it was blacke, and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and wéeted ſommewhat deepe, and tooke the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the wall, ſo that the weighte aboue beganne to ſhake, and doo as thoughe it woulde fall in euery place, where the ſoftneſſe of the earthe cauſed it to ſhrinke, in ſuche ſorte that al their prouiſion trembled, and the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders vpon the wall were afraide of drowninge, and by that time that it was nighte, a parte of the wall where the Towers ſtoode, fell downe, not ſo that the fall was leſſe then the water, nor hable to receiue the ſame, but that it was fiue yardes higher, ſo that almoſt it put them all in feare of drowninge. Wherefore there aroſe a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful crie of al manner of folkes that were in the Cittie,<note place="margin">Siene a paterne of a miſerable beſieged Cittie.</note> ſo that their enimies mighte heare it, who lifte vp theire handes to Heauen, and called to the Goddes for healpe, whiche was all theire hope that was leafte, and humbly beſoughte <hi>Oroondates</hi> to ſende Meſſengers to <hi>Hydaſpes</hi> to intreate of Peace. He was content, now beinge made the ſeruaunte of Fortune, were he neuer ſo loathe. But howe he ſhoulde ſende to his enimies, becauſe the waters wente rounde aboute him, he coulde not tell, but as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
<pb facs="tcp:6393:125"/>
taughte him. For when he had written what he woulde, and tied it to a ſtoane, with Slinge he caſte the ſame in ſtéede of a Meſſenger to his enimies, by that meanes ſente his humble praiers ouer the Sea. But he loſte his labour, for that the ſtrength of the Slinge could not ouerreach the lengthe of that ſpace, but fell into the water before it came to them. He caſte againe in like ſorte, and was deceiued: ſo did al the Archers, like ſuch as contended to ſhoote at ſomme marke, &amp; laboured to ſhoote beyonde the drowned grounde. Laſte of al they helde vp theire handes to their enimies that ſtoode on their For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, who had good game at their miſcries, and declared by ſignes as well as they coulde, what thoſe throwes meante: ſommetime they helde vp theire handes before them, like ſuch as craued mercy: ſommetime would they holde them behinde their backes, in token that they were ready to receiue Bandes, and becomme theire bondmen. <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> perceiued that they deſired healthe, and was ready to graunte it them. For the enimie that yéeldeth, dothe make, and in a manner force a Noble man to be gentle. But becauſe he had no ready waie thereto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, he determined to trie them better. There were certaine Boates whiche he ſuffered to comme out of <hi>Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> into his Ditche, &amp; there he withhelde them. When he had choſen tenne of the neweſt of them, and furniſhed them with Archers, and other armed Souldiers, &amp; tolde them what they ſhould ſaie, he ſent them to the <hi>Perſians.</hi> They rowed ouer in good order, that if theire enimies would doo any thinge that they looked not for, they might be ready to fighte. Truely this was a ſtraunge ſighte, that a Ship ſhoulde ſayle from wall to wall, and a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner ſhoulde practiſe his ſkill in the middeſt of the drye lande, &amp; a Beate be rowed where the Plowe was woont to woorke. And although the toile of warre euer deuiſeth<note place="margin">In warre be newe diuiſes alwaies.</note> newe thinges, yet then inuented it the ſtraungeſt thing, when it made thoſe that were in Shippes fighte with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:6393:125"/>
that ſtoode vpon the walles, and ioined twoo Armes by Sea, and Lande togeather. Thoſe that were vpon the walles ſéeinge the Boates ful of armed men driue neare to that parte where the wall was fallen downe, beinge men amazed, and ful of feare for their preſent daungers, ſuſpected them who came for theire ſafetie (becauſe in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremitie,<note place="margin">In extremitie euery thinge is fearefull.</note> all that happeneth is feared, and ſuſpected) and ſo caſte ſtoanes, and ſhotte toward the Shippes. In ſuch ſorte deale men that are in a deſperate caſe, accoumpting euery ſmall protractinge of their life, a vauntage. Mary in their caſtinge they ſo directed theire handes that they woulde not hurte them, but forebidde them the Lande. The <hi>Aethiopians</hi> alſo ſhot, but more certainely, and as men that vnderſtoode not the <hi>Perſians</hi> minde, and killed them by twoo or thrée at ones, ſo that ſomme of them ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely wounded, fel ouer the walles headlonge into the water. And the ſkirmiſhe had ben woorſe while the one ſpared, and did but defende them from land, and the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians</hi> foughte very angerly, if a certaine Olde Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of <hi>Siene</hi> had not comme and ſpoken thus to them on the walles: O madde men, and too much amazed with<note place="margin">A wiſe Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilman of Siene.</note> youre miſeries, doo wée nowe kéepe them of, whom wée humbly praied to helpe vs before, ſéeinge that they come to vs contrary to all hope? who if they come friendely, and bringe vs Peace, they ſhalbe our ſauiours: but if thei meane to deale like enimies, they may with litle labour be ſlaine when they be landed: but what ſhall we be the better when wée haue ſlaine theſe, ſéeinge that ſo blacke a clowde hangeth ouer our heades bothe by Water, and Lande? why doo wée not rather let them comme in, that we may vnderſtand what they haue to ſay?

With this anſweare the Legates departed, and tooke the twoo <hi>Perſians</hi> with them, &amp; recoumpted to <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> howe they had ſaide. Who after he had ſmiled a litle, &amp; much blamed <hi>Oroondates</hi> for his great fooliſhneſſe, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge a man not in his owne power, but in an other mans either to liue or die, would argue of any conditions, ſaid: It were very fondly donne, to deſtroye ſuche a number for one mannes madneſſe, and ſo he let thoſe departe to <hi>Eliphantina</hi> that <hi>Oroondates</hi> ſente, as thoughe he cared not if they made what prouiſion they could to withſtand him. But of his owne men he appointed ſome to make a Damme at the entrance of <hi>Nylus,</hi> into his Ditche, and other ſome to turne the water an other waie, that ſo the water (if there came no more in) mighte be the ſooner a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoided out of the ſpace betwéene <hi>Siene,</hi> and them, and the harder to trauell in. They beganne the woorke a litle as they were commaunded, and woulde haue procéeded the nexte daie, but then they could doo no more becauſe of the nighte that came vpon them. Moreouer they that were in the Cittie ſoughte al meanes they coulde to ſaue them ſelues, and were all comforted with this health that was promiſed them vnlooked for. And thoſe that made the Mine vnderneathe the grounde, drewe ſomewhat neare to the enimies Ditche: whiche thinge they gheaſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they tooke the meaſure of the ſpace with a Line: o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſet proppes to ſtaie vp the walles, which thinge they mighte eaſily doo, becauſe of the Stoanes when the wall fell inwarde. Yet when they had donne all that they coulde, and thought them ſelues in ſaftie, they were not a litle troubled, but about midnight a great parte of that the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> beganne to digge before night (whether it were becauſe the grounde was looſe, and not thicke ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough

                  <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> &amp; <hi>Sienians</hi> thought that the moſte parte of the Walles was fallen downe.

But the Citezins wente rounde aboute vpon the walles, &amp; ſeinge that all was wel there, they thought that their enimies had had ſome miſhappe, vntil y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> morninge tooke a waie al this doubt, &amp; the breache was eſpied, &amp; the water ſuddainely auoided. The<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> did the <hi>Aethiopia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s</hi> Damme vp the entrie of their ditche, &amp; made fludde gates of woodde, &amp; layde many thouſand loades of earthe therein, whiche they fetched as well from the lande, as by water in their boates, and thus wente the water awaie at length, yet could neither of them come to the other: for the earth was couered with a thicke inued, and vnder that whiche ſéemed to be drie at the toppe, there was muche wetneſſe, whiche as well deceiued men as Horſes. So they paſſed their time twoo or thrée daies, and in token of peace the people of <hi>Siene</hi> ſette open their gates, and the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> laide a ſide theire Armoure. And ſo was there a truce, yet came they not togeather, neither was there kepte watche and warde, with either of them. But they that were in the Cittie gaue them<note place="margin">Niloa a feaſte that the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians keepe in the honour of Nylus.</note> ſelues to paſtime &amp; pleaſure, for then it hapned that the hieſt feaſt that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> haue fel, which is kept holy aboute midſomer, at what time the Floudde encreaſde, and it is honoured more then al other for this cauſe, The
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:6393:127"/>
                  <hi>Egyptians</hi> faine <hi>Nylus</hi> to be a God, and the greateſt of al<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And this is the common ſortes opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. But the cauſe why they gaue him ſo Diuine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noure is, becauſe they thinke that the mixture of moyſte, and drie is the eſpecial cauſe of the beginninge, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuaunce of mannes life (as for the other Elementes, they depende vpon theſe, and are where ſo euer theſe be) and they deeme that moiſture procéedeth from <hi>Nylus,</hi> and driues from the Earthe: but this euery man knoweth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo. Mary their Diuines ſaie, that the Earthe is <hi>Iſis,</hi> and <hi>Nylus, Oſiris,</hi> geuinge to either a newe name. Therefore the Goddeſſe is very deſirous of his companie, and reioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth when he is with her, but lowreth when he is abſent, as if ſome vnhappy blaſte by lightninge had touched her. This tale haue the ſkilful men in Natures ſecretes diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, becauſe as I thinke, they woulde not make prophane perſonnes priuie of the ſecreſies conteined therein: but they inſtructe thoſe that are deſirous to knowe theſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uities in their veſtery by Candell lighte. And lette this ſuffiſe to be ſpoken at this time, by the leaue of the Gods, as for the greate ſecretes they ſhall not be reueled for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence ſake. Nowe let vs procéede with that whiche was donne aboute <hi>Siene</hi> orderly. When the feaſt of <hi>Ny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> was come, the inhabitantes fel to killing of Beaſtes, and to doo Sacrifice, and for al that their bodies were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied with theire preſente perilles, yet theire mindes, as muche as they might were godly diſpoſed. <hi>Oroondates</hi> waytinge his time, when the <hi>Sienians</hi> were faſte a ſléepe after theire feaſtinge, conueyed his Army priuily out, for he had ſecretely geuen the <hi>Perſians</hi> warninge before, at what howre and whiche gate he woulde goe foorthe, Euery decurion was charged to leaue all their Horſes and other Cattell behinde, that they mighte not trouble
<pb facs="tcp:6393:128"/>
them in their way, nor make a noyſe whereby that they did ſhould be diſcouered, but euery man to take his Armoure, and a Boorde, or Planke vnder his arme. When they were comme togeather, as he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, he caſte the boordes that euery man carried o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthwart the Oſe, and laide them in ſuche ſorte that one touched another, and ſo conducted ouer his Army with little paine and great ſpéede, as if there had benne a bridge, for that they who came after, deliuered theire boordes to them that wente before. When he came to<note place="margin">Oroondates ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile eſcape from Siene to Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantina.</note> lande, he went priuily by the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> who ſuſpected nothinge leſſe, nor kepte watche any longer, but ſleapte ſoundly, as faſt as his breathe woulde geue him leaue, &amp; wente to <hi>Eliphantina,</hi> and was lette in by &amp; by, for that the twoo <hi>Perſians</hi> whiche were ſente from <hi>Siene</hi> (as was appointed) wayted for his comminge euery nighte, and when they hearde theire watche woorde, they ſette open the gates. When it was daye the people of <hi>Siene</hi> firſte knew of this eſcape, ſuſpectinge the ſame for that euery man miſſed the <hi>Perſian</hi> that was Lodged in his houſe, and coulde not heare of them, and by the bridge whiche they ſawe before the Towne. Then was the Cittie in great feare againe, and looked for grieuous puniſhment, for this ſeconde iniury, becauſe they had ſhewed them ſelues ſo vnfaithfull, to let the <hi>Perſians</hi> eſcape, after they had founde ſuche clemency at the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> handes. Wherefore they determined euery man to goe out of the Cittie, and yéelde them ſelues to the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> and by Othe to confirme their ignoraunce, if happely they may mooue them to pitie. When all of euery age were come togeather, and had taken bowes in their handes, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their lowlineſſe and humilitie, and with Tapers burninge carried all their Goddes, and holy Images in tooken of peace, were come ouer that brydge to the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians,</hi> they fell vpon their knées and ſate a farre of, gaue all at once a ſorrowfull &amp; lamentable crie, crauinge

in humble ſorte the forgeueneſſe of their offence: and to<note place="margin">A pitifull ſighte.</note> obteine it the rather, they laied their Infantes before them, ſufferinge them to goe whither they woulde, ſo aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaginge the wrathe of the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> with their age, whiche was without ſuſpition and blame. Thoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for feare ranne from theire Parentes and Nources with a woonderful crie: ſomme crepte in the waie whiche wente towarde the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> Hoſte: other laie, and cried whiche coulde not ſpeake perfitely, and would haue made any man to take compaſſion vpon them, becauſe Fortune euen in them printed out an humble eſtate. When <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> ſawe this, he thoughte that they craued mercye in more earneſt ſorte then they did before, and therefore ſente one to knowe what they woulde haue, and howe it happened that they ranne out alone, and not the <hi>Perſians</hi> with them? They tolde him all, the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> Flight, their Innocency, the Hie Feaſte of the Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, and howe that they priuily ſlipte awaie while they were buſie in the ſeruice of their God, and when thei had banqueted, and were fallen aſléepe. Whereas perhappes if they had ſente them without Armour they ſhoulde not haue ben hable to haue ſtaied them beinge armed. When <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> hearde this, he ſuſpected (as the trothe was in déede) that <hi>Oroondates</hi> would doo ſommewhat to entrap, and hurte him. Wherfore he ſent onely for the Prieſtes, &amp; when he had woorſhipped the Goddes of greateſt price, he aſked them if they coulde infourme him of any thinge that they meante to doo, and whither they were gonne, and where in was their greateſt truſte. They anſwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that they knewe nothinge certainely: mary they dée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that he was gonne to <hi>Eliphantina,</hi> where the chiefe ſtrengthe of his Armye laie, and that <hi>Oroondates</hi> beſte truſte was in his Barde Horſes. When they had ſaide thus, thei deſired him to goe into y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Towne as his owne, and to take from them all his diſpleaſure. But <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> would not enter into it at that time, yet he ſente thither
<pb facs="tcp:6393:129"/>
twoo Troupes of Armed men, to ſée whether there were any guile as he ſuſpected, if not that they ſhoulde be a Garriſon to defende the Cittie, this donne he ſent away the people of Siene with gentle promiſes, and went him ſelfe forwarde with his Army, either to receiue the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> if they ſet vpon him, or if they would not, to charge them. He had ſcante ſette his menne in araye, but his Spialles gaue him warninge, that the <hi>Perſians</hi> were co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minge in Battayle raye with Banners diſplaied. <hi>Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ondates</hi> muſtred a great Army at <hi>Eliphantina,</hi> but when he ſawe that the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> were ſo néere, and he loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not for them ſo ſoone, he was forced to take <hi>Siene</hi> with a fewe Souldiers, where he encloſed on euery ſide, for all that he ſued for ſaftie, and obteined it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> promiſe, yet was he the falſeſt man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liue, who cauſed twoo <hi>Perſians</hi> to goe ouer with the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians,</hi> vnder coloure that they ſhoulde enquire, and know howe they of <hi>Eliphantina</hi> would make peace with <hi>Hidaſpes,</hi> but in déede to vnderſtand whether they made them ſelues ready to Battaile, if he by any meanes could eſcape, whiche fraudulente, and guilefull deuiſe he put then in practiſe. And when he founde them well proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he leadde them foorthe ſtraighte, and protracted no time til he came to his enimies, puttinge all his hope in celeritie, if he mighte take his enimies vnprouided. By this time either Armye had fighte of other, and he tooke the fielde firſte with al the <hi>Perſian</hi> brauery, ſo that it gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered with theire ſiluer and gilte Armoure, as if all the place had benne on fire. For then the Sunne aroſe, and ſhining vpon the <hi>Perſians,</hi> gaue ſuch a wonderful bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from their complet Harneys, that it rebounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe that were a greate waie of. In the right winge of his Army he placed the <hi>Medes,</hi> and <hi>Perſians</hi> that dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led<note place="margin">The order of Oroondates his armie.</note> not farre of, in the Forfrunte whereof wente thoſe that were ſurely armed, &amp; the Archers that were lightly Harneſſed came behinde them, that they might ſhoote the

better, beinge defended by them. In his left winge were the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> and <hi>Aphricanes</hi> placed, and Slingers and Archers with them too, &amp; them he charged ofte to breake out, and aſſaile the ſide of their enimies Battayle. Him ſelfe was in the middeſt of his maine Battaile, ſittinge in a Chariote very brauely encloſed therewith rounde about, for his better ſafety, before whom were his barde Horſemen, vpon truſte of whome he ventured to ioyne with his enimies. For this is a valiaunt crue, and is ſet before the other Army, as if it were a walle that might not be battred. They are armed thus: A picked fellowe<note place="margin">Howe the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Horſeman is armed.</note> of greate ſtrength putteth vpon him an Helmet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge, whiche is as ſitte for him, as if he ſhould put on a Viſarde in a Maſke: this couereth all his head downe to his ſhoulders, ſauinge that there be holes left for him to looke out at, in his right hande is a greate ſtaffe, bigger then a Speare, with his lefte hande he ruleth his Horſe, by his ſide hangeth a Swoorde, and all his body is coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with a Iacke. And a Iacke is made thus: with pieces<note place="margin">Howe a Iacke is made.</note> of Braſſe, and Iron, as bigge as the palme of a mans hande, they make a coate as it were of ſeales, layinge the ende and ſides of eche of theſe vpon other (ſo that the nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thermoſt parte of one, goeth ouer the toppe of the other) and ſo they ſowe them togeather, and this lieth vpon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery parte of the body without any adoo: it compaſſeth euery iointe, and neuer letteth a man either to ſtraine out his limmes, or drawe them in, for it hath ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Beinge thus appointed, and in a manner throwen into his Armoure, he ſitteth vpon his Horſe, mary he leapeth not vp him ſelfe, but other helpe him, he is ſo combred with the waight of his Armoure. And when the time of Battayle commeth, he geueth his Horſe the Raines, and ſpurreth him with his heeles, and ſo faſte as he can, he rideth vpon his enimies like a man made of Iron, or an Image faſhioned with hammers. His great ſtaffe at the fore end is tied to his Horſe necke with a corde, and the hinder ende is made faſte to the buttockes of the Horſe, ſo that in the conflicte it flieth not backe, but helpeth the Horſemans hande, which doth but guide the ſame arighte, and by that meanes geueth the greater blowe, ſo that it ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>neth through euery man that it hittes, and oftentimes it beareth through too menne at one blowe.

they came to fight. When the token was geuen in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Army with Trumpette, but in the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> with Drumme and Timbrell, <hi>Oroondates</hi> ſet forwarde as faſte as he could, but Hidaſpes at firſt went as ſoftely as poſſible he might, by this meane prouidinge that the Elephantes ſhoulde not be farre from thoſe that ſhoulde reſcue and defende them, and that the Horſemen in the middell of his enimies Army, ſhould be tired before they came to ſtrokes, as ſoone as they were within daunger of ſhotte, and the <hi>Blemmies</hi> perceiued that the Horſemen were haſty to comme vpon them, did as <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded, and leauing the <hi>Seres</hi> to ſée to the Elephantes, they ranne a greate waie before their fellowes towarde the Horſemen, that thoſe who ſawe them woulde haue thought they had benne madde, that beyng ſo fewe, durſt incounter with ſo many, and ſo well Armed.

When theſe had donne, <hi>Perſina</hi> met him in the Church Porche. When they had made an end of their praiers, and thankeſgeuinge for his Victory, and ſafe returne, they made them ready to the publike Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and he ſate in a Tabernacle made ready before for that pourpoſe: that ſame was made of foure Réedes, new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly<note place="margin">The Reedes of Aethiopia are great belike.</note> cut downe, foure ſquare, ſo that at euery corner ſtoode a Réede to ſtaie it vp in ſtéede of a Piller, the toppe was made rounde, and couered with diuers bowes, the faireſt whereof were braunches broken from the <hi>Palme</hi> trées. In an other Tabernacle harde by this vpon places aboue were ſet the Images of that Country Gods, and the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures of Noble men, eſpecially of <hi>Memnon, Perſeus,</hi> and <hi>Andromeda</hi> whom the Kinges of <hi>Aethiopia</hi> ſuppoſe to be the Authours of their ſtocke. In other ſeates beneath ſate the <hi>Gymnoſophiſtae,</hi> &amp; had in a manner their Goddes ouer their heades: aboute theſe ſtoode a crue of Souldiers round, which with their ſhieldes before them kepte backe the multitude, and reſerued a place in the middeſt for the Sacrificers without al tumulte or diſeaſe. As ſoone as <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> had in fewe woordes declared to the people his

Victory, &amp; what he had donne els luckely for the Common Wealthe, he commaunded them who had to doo with the Holy affayres to beginne theire Sacrifice. There were<note place="margin">The manner of there Sacrifice.</note> thrée Aultars made, twoo which apperteined to the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Moone</hi> were ſet togeather: the thirde that was <hi>Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus,</hi> was erected a good waie of, to him they ſacrificed all manner of liuing thinges, becauſe that his power is wel knowen, as I ſuppoſe, and pleaſeth all. Vpon the other Aultars to the <hi>Sunne</hi> were offered yonge white Horſes, and to the <hi>Moone,</hi> a Yoke of Oxen, by reaſon that they helpe them in theire Huſbandrye, not farre from thence. While theſe thinges were in dooinge, there was a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine vncertaine voice heard (as is like would be emong ſuche a multitude) whiche cried: Let the Sacrifice whiche our Countrie accuſtometh to doo, be now made for al our ſafties, then let the firſte fruites that were gotten in the warre be offered. <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> perceiued that they called for Humaine Sacrifices, whiche are woonte to be offered of thoſe that are taken in ſtraunge warres, and beckened with hande, and tolde them that he woulde by and by doo what they required: and therewith he commaunded the priſoners appointed for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> pourpoſe to be brought foorthe, emong whom came <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and <hi>Cariclia</hi> not bounde, but garded aboute with men: all the other were heauie, and good reaſon why, ſauinge <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and <hi>Cariclia</hi> ſmiled, and wente with a chéerefull countenaunce, and alwaye looked vpon <hi>Perſina,</hi> ſo that ſhée alſo was moued therewith, and ſoare ſighinge ſaide: O Huſbande, what a maide haue you appointed to be ſacrificed? I know not whether euer I ſawe ſo fayre a Creature? what a ſtoute ſtomake: what a bewtifull viſage hath ſhée? with howe couragious a harte beareth ſhée this Fortune? how doth ſhée moue my minde, by reaſon of her flowringe age? If the Daughter that I had by you, which was ſo euil loſte, had liued, ſhée woulde haue ben almoſte as olde as ſhée. But Huſbande, I would to God ye might deliuer her by
<pb facs="tcp:6393:139"/>
ſome meanes from this perill, ſurely I ſhould haue great comforte if ſhée ſerued at my Table &amp; wayted vpon me. Perhappes alſo the vnhappy Creature is a <hi>Greeke</hi> for neuer was there ſuche a face in <hi>Egypt.</hi> Shée is a <hi>Greeke</hi> anſweared he in déede, borne of Father &amp; Mother, whom ſhée hath promiſed to ſhewe at this time, but I am ſure ſhée ſhall neuer be able to doo that. But that ſhée ſhoulde be deliuered from this Sacrifice it is not poſſible, though I woulde, and yet am I moued ſomewhat too with the Mayde, and haue compaſſion vpon her: You knowe that the Lawe requireth a man to be offered to the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and a wooman to the <hi>Moone,</hi> and becauſe ſhée was broughte me firſte and ordeined for this purpoſe, the people would be content with no excuſe, onely one healpe there is, if ſhée be founde not to be a cleane Mayde, without med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge with man, when ſhée ſhal goe to the fire, ſeing that the Lawe willeth that ſhée be as well cleane alſo, that is offered to the <hi>Moone,</hi> as he that is Sacrificed to the <hi>Sunne,</hi> as for <hi>Bacchus</hi> it made no greate matter. But take héede that if ſhée be founde to haue accompanied with men, it be no honeſty to take her into your houſe. Then ſaide <hi>Perſina,</hi> let her be founde to haue donne that,<note place="margin">Captiuitie, VVarre, &amp;c. maketh many euill deedes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to be pardonned.</note> ſo ſhée may be ſaued: Captiuitie, Warre, and baniſhed life, ſo farre from her owne Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trie, excuſeth her though ſhée haue donne any ſuche thinge, whoſe bewty is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to make her to be forced. While ſhée ſpake thus, and wept, but would not haue them that were by to perceiue ſo muche, <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> commaunded fire to be brought, then were the yonge Children gathered togeather, and the<note place="margin">The maner how the Aethiopians tried the Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the yonge men and Maydes appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed.</note> Prieſtes (which onely may touche it without any harme) brought it out of the Churche, and ſet it in the middeſt, and badde al the pryſoners treade vpon it. All thoſe that trode vpon it were burned in the ſoles of their féete, and were not hable to abide it any while, there were ſpittes of Golde laide to the fire, whiche was wrought to ſuche purpoſe, that it would burne euery vnchaſte perſon, and
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:6393:139"/>
him that was forſworne, but ſuche as had liued other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, might treade vpon it and haue no harme. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they appointed theſe to <hi>Bacchus</hi> and other Goddes, ſauinge twoo or thrée Maydes of <hi>Greece,</hi> whiche were founde to haue kepte theire Virginitie. After <hi>Theage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes</hi> alſo put his foote to the fire, and was founde a Maide, there was great wonderinge, bothe for that he beinge ſo tale and bewtifull, as alſo becauſe he was ſo yonge and luſty, and had neuer to doo with any wooman, and ſo he was appointed to be offered to the <hi>Sunne.</hi> Then ſpake he ſoftely to <hi>Cariclia,</hi> and ſaide: Is Sacrificinge the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde of ſuch as liue cleanly in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> and ſhal they be ſlaine, that kéepe their Virginitie? But <hi>Cariclia</hi> why doo you not nowe manifeſt your ſelfe? What other time doo you looke for hereafter? will you tarry till one come to cutte our throtes? vtter I praie you, and tell your eſtate, perhappes when you are knowen you ſhall ſaue me, if not, yet you with out doubt ſhalbe out of daunger, whiche thinge when I ſée, I ſhalbe better content to die. When ſhée had anſweared him, that her time was nowe at hande, and that the whole eſtate of her Fortune was ſette vpon ſixe and ſeuen, ſhée tarried not, till they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maunded her, that had charge of that matter, but put vpon her the holy Garment, that ſhée brought from <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi,</hi> whiche ſhée alwaye carried in a little Fardell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boute her, wrought with Golde, &amp; other coſtly Iuelles, And when ſhée had caſt her heare abroade, like one taken with Diuine fury, ranne and leapte into the fire, &amp; ſtoode there a greate while without harme, and her bewty then appeared a greate deale more, ſo that euery man looked vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her, and by reaſon of her ſtoole thought her more like a Goddeſſe, then a mortall wooman. Thereat was euery man amazed, and muttered ſoare, but nothing they ſaide plainely, and woondred beſide all other thinges that ſhée beinge more bewtiful then any mortall wooman, and in her beſte youth had not loſte her virginitie: ſo that diuers
<pb facs="tcp:6393:140"/>
in the company were ſorrowfull that ſhée was fitte to be offered, and woulde if they wiſte howe, gladly haue deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered her, for al that they were very ſuperſtitious. But <hi>Perſina</hi> aboue al other was moſte ſorrowful, ſo that ſhée ſaide to <hi>Hidaſpes,</hi> howe vnhappy is this wenche, whiche boaſteth ſo muche of her virginitie at ſuch vnreaſnnable time, and muſte die for all this praiſe, But Huſbande, howe ſhal wée doo with her? He anſweared, you trouble me in vaine, and for naught take you pitie vpon her that cannot be ſaued, but hath benne kepte from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge (as may be gheaſſed) for the excellency of her Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the Goddes alone. Then ſpake he to the <hi>Gymno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophiſtes,</hi> and ſaide: Right wiſe menne ſéeinge that all thinges are ready, why doo you not begin to doo this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice?

As for vs wée will goe aſide into the Churche, for wée our ſelues miſlike, and ſuppoſe that the Goddes doo not allowe ſuche abominable Sacrifice, as is donne with menne and woomen, and I would to God that wée might alſo diſalowe and fordoo all the other Sacrifices,<note place="margin">VVhat Sacrifice the Goddes like beſte.</note> whiche are made with ſlaughter, for as muche as in our opinion that ſufficeth which is donne with Prayers &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſwéete ſauours. But tarry you (for there is no doubt but the King muſt néedes be there to appeaſe the people) and doo this vncleane Sacrifice, becauſe of the Olde cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes and Decrées of <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> that muſte néedes be donne, yet ſo that you ſhal haue néede to purge your ſelfe afterwarde, and ſhall ſcante be hable to doo it, I thinke that this Sacrifice ſhal not come to any good ende, for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe cauſes, but eſpecially for that God hathe tolde me ſo, &amp; becauſe the fire ſtandeth aboute theſe Straungers, and ſignifieth that there is ſomme God that defendeth them. When he had ſaide thus, he and the reſte that ſate by him aroſe, and went their waie. Then <hi>Cariclia</hi> leapt

out of the fire, and ranne to <hi>Siſimithres,</hi> and fell flatte at his knées (in ſpite of the Officers, whiche woulde haue ſtaied her, becauſe they thought that her humilitie was for nothing els, but to craue that ſhée might not die) and ſaide: Moſte wiſe menne ſtay a while, for I haue a cauſe to pleade with the Kinge and Quéene, and muſte haue Iudgemente thereon, and I heare that you onely geue ſentence vpon ſuche Noble perſons. Wherefore abide, and be you iudges of this plea of life and deathe, for you ſhall knowe, that it is neither poſſible, nor iuſte to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to the Goddes.

when he was ſente Embaſſadoure to <hi>Oroondates</hi> aboute the <hi>Smaradge</hi> Mines, and at that time he was one of the <hi>Gymnoſophiſtae,</hi> and chiefe of al the reſte. Then knewe not <hi>Cariclia</hi> him by his face, becauſe ſhée was ſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from him very yonge, and but ſeuen yéeres olde, mary ſhée remembred his name, and was the gladder for that, becauſe ſhée truſted that he would be her Aduocate, and healpe her to be knowen. Therefore ſhee helde her handes vp to Heauen, and ſaide alowde that all mighte heare: O Sunne, the fonnder of my Anceſtours petygrée, and yée other Goddes, &amp; Noble men, you ſhall beare me witneſſe that I ſaie nothinge but truthe, and healpe me in this place, to which I wil bringe due proufe: and there beginne. Doo you commaunde, <hi>ô</hi> Kinge, ſtraungers, or this Countrie menne to be offered? Straungers (ꝙ he). Then is it time (ſaide ſhée) that you ſéeke other to be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed, for you ſhall finde me to be one of this Countrie borne, and youre Subiecte. He marueiled at this, and ſaide ſhée lied. Softe (ꝙ <hi>Cariclia</hi>) you woonder at ſmall thinges, there be greater maters then this, for I am not only one of this Countrie borne, but of the Bloud Roial. <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> deſpiſed her woordes, &amp; turned away as though they had ben to no pourpoſe. Then (ꝙ ſhée) Father, leaue of thus to deſpiſe, &amp; refuſe your owne Daughter. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Kinge not onely deſpiſed her, but waxed very wrothe, accoumpting that iudgemente a greate ſcorne, &amp; intollerable wronge, &amp; ſaide: <hi>Siſimithres,</hi> &amp; the reſte, how longe ſhal ſhée abuſe my ouer great pacience? Is not the mayde ſtarke mad? who of ſingulare boldeneſſe with lies ſéeketh t auoide deathe, and ſaith ſhée is my Daughter, as if it were in a Comedy, and this but of a deſperate minde, and fonde deuiſed matter? For my parte (as you knowe) I neuer had ſo good lucke, as to haue a Childe, onely ones it was tolde me that I had one, but I loſte her by and by. Wherefore lette me carrye her awaye that ſhée delaye the Sacrifice no longer. No man

ſhall carrye me awaye, <hi>Cariclia</hi> ſayde, excepte the Iudges commaunde, and you youre ſelfe are iudged nowe and doo not iudge, nor determine. Perhaps <hi>ô</hi> King the Lawe ſuffereth you to kill Straungers, but neither this Lawe, nor the Lawe of nature will, that you kill your owne Children, for the Goddes ſhal proue this daie that you are my Father, though you ſay naie. Euery controuerſie in Lawe <hi>ô</hi> Kinge ſtandeth vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> twoo pointes eſpecially, that is to ſaie, proofe by writinges, and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation by witneſſes.

As ſoone as ſhée had ſaide this, ſhée tooke her Faſcia, that ſhée carried aboute her, and vnfoulded it, and gaue it to <hi>Perſina.</hi> As ſoone as ſhée ſawe it, ſhée was ſtraight ſo amaſed that ſhe coulde ſaie neuer a woorde, and looked a great while vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that whiche was written therein, and the mayde togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo that for feare ſhée trembled, and ſweate ſore, and was gladde of that ſhée ſawe, mary ſhée was muche trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with the ſuddainneſſe of the chaunce, which hapned in ſuche ſorte as no man would beleue it. Beſide this ſhée feared if it were opened, leaſte <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> would ſuſpecte ſomewhat, and be too light of beliefe, or angry and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happes pouniſhe her, in ſo much that <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> ſeing her ſo amazed, ſaide: Wooman what meaneth this? Dothe ought contained in this writinge, thus trouble thée? O Kinge, my Lorde and Huſbande (ꝙ ſhée) I haue nothinge to ſaie thereto, but take it and reade it your ſelfe, the ſame ſhal teache you well yenough: and as ſoone as ſhée had geuen it him, ſhée ſatte downe againe very ſadde. When <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> had it, &amp; had called the <hi>Gymnoſophiſtae</hi> to reade it with him, he ranne ouer the ſame, and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueiled muche thereat him ſelfe, and perceiued well that
<pb facs="tcp:6393:142"/>
                  <hi>Siſimithres</hi> was abaſhed, and that ſixe hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred thoughtes aroſe in his minde, ſo that he looked oft vpon the Faſcia, and oft vpon the Mayde: When he had readde all, &amp; was throughly inſtructed aſwel of her expoſition, as the cauſe thereof, he ſaide: I knowe well that I had a Daughter, whiche for all that it was tolde me ſhée was deade, and <hi>Perſina</hi> ſaide ſo her ſelfe alſo to me, yet now I know that ſhée was ſente abreade to ſéeke her Fortune. But who was he that tooke her vp, ſaued her, and nouriſhed her thus, or who was he that carried her into <hi>Egypte?</hi> Was he taken with her? to be ſhorte, howe may I knowe that this is ſhe, and whether that which was caſte foorthe be not deade, and ſome man when he hapned to finde this, would abuſe his good lucke, and geue them to this Maide, and make her playe this parte, and ſo ſcorne the greate deſire that wée haue, to haue a Childe, by ſuborninge ſome chaungelinge, and couloringe the truthe with this Faſcia. To this <hi>Siſimithres</hi> anſweared, I can reſolue you of your firſte doubte: for I am he that tooke her vp, and kepte her ſecretely, and carried her into <hi>Egypt,</hi> when you ſente me Embaſſadour thither. You knowe well ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that wée maie not lie. And I knowe this Faſcia, whiche is written with the letters of the Kinges of <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia:</hi> Wherefore wée néede not doubte, that it was deuiſed any where els, and you haue good cauſe to know it, becauſe it is written with <hi>Perſinas</hi> hande. But there were other tokens alſo that I gaue to him, who receiued her of me, whiche was a <hi>Greeke,</hi> and by ſéeminge a good and honeſt man: I haue them alſo ſaide <hi>Cariclia,</hi> and ſo ſhewed them the Iuelles, with which ſight <hi>Perſina</hi> was more aſtonied then ſhée was before. And when <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> aſked her what they were? and whether ſhée knewe any of them? Gaue him none other anſweare, but that ſhée knew them, mary it was better to make further triall of theſe thinges at home. Then was <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> troubled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, and almoſt beſide him ſelfe: but <hi>Cariclia</hi> ſaide theſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:6393:142"/>
tokens my Mother gaue me, but this Kinge is yours, &amp; then ſhée ſhewed him the <hi>Pantarbe. Hidaſpes</hi> knewe it, for he gaue it to <hi>Perſina,</hi> when he was betrothed to her, and ſaide: theſe tokens be very good and mine owne, but yet I know not that you haue them as my Daughter, &amp; haue not come by them by any other meanes. For to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitte other thinges your colour is ſtrange, and the like is not ſéene in <hi>Aethiopia.</hi> Shée was white too (ſaide <hi>Siſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mithres</hi>) that I brought vp, and the terme of yéeres dothe well agrée with the age of this Mayde, for that the time of the expoſition was ſeuentiene yéeres agone, and ſhée is ſeuentiene yéeres olde, more her eies wil prooue no leſſe, and all the habite of her bodie is like her that I ſawe at that time. <hi>Siſimithres</hi> (ꝙ <hi>Hidaſpes</hi>) you haue ſaide very well, &amp; rather haue defended this cauſe as an Aduocate, then ſatte vpon it in Iudgement: but beware that while you goe aboute to take awaye parte of this doubte, you charge not my wife with a very harde matter. How is it poſſible by reaſon, that ſeinge wée be bothe <hi>Aethiopians</hi> ſhoulde begette a white Childe? <hi>Siſimithres</hi> then looked aſide vpon him, and ſmilinge ſcornefully, ſaide: I cannot tell what ayleth you, that you preſently be thus affected, that you obiecte this Patrocinie to me as a facte woorthy blame, whiche I thinke I ought not to neglect. For wée<note place="margin">VVho is the beſte Iudge.</note> call him the beſte iudge whiche is a Patrone and defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of equitie: but why doo I not rather defende you then the Mayde? ſeinge that I haue proued you to be a Father by the healpe of the Goddes. And ſhould I now deſpiſe her, whom I haue kepte for you from her Cradell? But thinke as you will of vs, wée paſſe not a pointe. For wée<note place="margin">So ought all good menne to liue.</note> liue not to pleaſe other menne, but ſéeke to contente our owne conſciences, with onely honeſty, and mere equitie. As touchinge your queſtion of her colour, the Faſcia an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweareth you, that <hi>Perſina</hi> conceiued ſuche a Figure by looking vpon <hi>Andromeda,</hi> when you had to doo with her: if you deſire to be fully ſatiſfied herein, and be made to
<pb facs="tcp:6393:143"/>
beleue without denial, the Picture is at hande, looke vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> 
                  <hi>Andromeda,</hi> who is as wel expreſſed in the Mayde, as in the Picture without any difference. This ſaide: the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers brought the Image whiche was carried awaye be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and when they had ſet it by <hi>Cariclia,</hi> there was ſuch a ſhoute amonge the people, by reaſon that thoſe who were neare, tolde them that were a farre of, and coulde not heare what was donne, that for ioye they wiſte not what to doo. So that <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> alſo coulde not diſtruſte any longer, but ſtoode a greate while, what for ioye and woonderinge, ſtill and ſturred not. Yet (ꝙ <hi>Siſimithres</hi>) wée wante one pointe, ſtrippe vp your ſléeue Mayde, for there was a blacke ſpotte aboue your Elbowe: it is no ſhame to be ſtripped for triall of your parentes &amp; kinred. <hi>Cariclia</hi> vncouered her lefte arme, &amp; aboute it there was in a manner a mole, muche like to the ſtrakes, that Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantes haue. <hi>Perſina</hi> coulde rule her ſelfe no longer,<note place="margin">Cariclia knowe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be Hidaſpes his Daughter.</note> but ſuddainely wente out of her Throne, imbraced her and wepte, and for the excéedingneſſe of her ioye, whiche ſhée could not conceale, ſhée made a certaine muttering, and ſhée wanted but little, to haue fallen with <hi>Cariclia. Hidaſpes</hi> had pitie vpon the wooman, when he ſawe her lamente ſo, &amp; him ſelfe was like affected in his minde too, but he kept teares out of his eies, as if thei had ben made of Iron or Horne, &amp; ſo looked vpon that which was done. And although his minde was moued as well with a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection, as with a manly courage, ſo that he was drawen bothe waies, yet he was at length ouercomed of<note place="margin">Nature ouerco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth all things</note> nature, whiche ouercommeth al thinges, &amp; did not onely ſuffer him ſelfe to be perſwaded that he was a Father, but was alſo affected like a Father: ſo that when he ſawe <hi>Perſina</hi> fel with her Daughter, he tooke her vp, imbraced <hi>Cariclia,</hi> and with teares, as with an offeringe, made a Fatherly League with her. Yet did he not foreget what he had to doo, but ſtoode ſtill a while and looked vpon the people, whiche were affected like him, and throughe ioie,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:6393:143"/>
and pitie wepte to ſée that ſtraunge hap, and woulde not heare the cries whiche commaunded ſilence. Wherefore he ſtretched out his hande, &amp; bad them be ſtill. And when<note place="margin">All this Oratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Hidaſpes, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth what is the duety of a good Kinge.</note> he had appeaſed them, he ſaide: Yée that be preſente, the Goddes contrary to all hope, haue declared that I am a Father, as you both heare &amp; ſée, &amp; that this is my Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it is proued by many argumentes: yet doo Iowe ſuch good wil to you, and my Countrie, that without regarde either to the ſucceſſion of my Bloude, or ioye that I haue to be called a Father, whiche all by her are like to enſue, am ready to offer her to the Goddes for your behoofe: and although I ſée you wéepe, and are affected like men, and haue pity vpon the vntimely age of the Maide appointed to die, &amp; to ſee me without al hope of ſucceſſion hereafter: yet muſt I néedes, though you ſay nay, perfourme the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of our Countrie, and rather haue regarde to the Soulelike vtilitie, then my priuate profite. Surely I knowe not, whether it be the Goddes wil to geue her to me, and take her away againe at one time (as they did at the firſt when ſhée was borne, and now are like to doo af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhée is founde) but I leaue that to be ſcanned by youre diſcretion: for I cannot determine whether they woulde haue her ſacrificed, whom they haue banniſhed into the furtheſt parte of the world, and by a woonderful chaunce brought to me againe like a priſoner. Which thinge ſée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge it falleth out thus, thoughe I haue not ſlaine her as an enimie, nor indamaged her ſince ſhée was priſoner, yet nowe I know that ſhée is my Daughter, I wil make a Sacrifice of her, if you deſire it, without more adoo: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wil I yéelde to affection, whiche in an other Father perhaps deſerued pardon, not be abaſhed, nor deſire you to be good to me, and graunt me this fauour that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Lawe of nature requireth, in ſparing her for my fanſie, becauſe wée may appeaſe the Goddes ſome other waye, but euen as you haue ben like affected as I, and as ſorrowfull for my miſhaps as your owne: ſo wil I make more accoumpt
<pb facs="tcp:6393:144"/>
of your Weale Publike, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> mine owne priuate commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditie, without any reſpecte at all to this miſerie, neither will I ſet by ſorrowful <hi>Perſinas</hi> teares, who hath now at this time ſéene her firſt childe, and is a Mother, &amp; ſhal by and by be ſpoyled thereof. Wherefore if you will, leaue your wéepinge, and fruiteleſſe pityinge of me, and let vs goe to our Sacrifice. Now to thée my Daughter (for firſt &amp; laſte wil I cal thée by this pleaſant name) whoſe bewty is péereleſſe to no pourpoſe, and haſt found thy Parentes in vaine, which haſte in an ill time happened vpon thine owne Country, woorſe to thée then any ſtraunge Lande, who haſte ben ſafe in other Countries, but arte in daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of deathe in thine owne, trouble not my minde with ſorrowful wéeping: but if euer thou diddeſt ſhew thy ſelf to be of ſtoute courage, and Princely minde, now plucke vp thy harte, and folow thy Father, who cannot prouide a marriage for thée, not bringe thée to bedde in any coſtly Bowers, but make thée ready for Sacrifice, and beare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thée, not ſuche Tapers as are vſed at Bridalles, but appointed for Sacrifice, &amp; is in wil to make an offeringe of thine vnſpeakeable bewty: &amp; you Gods beare with me, if affection hathe cauſed me to ſpeake any thinge ſcante godly, or religiouſly, who haue both called her my daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and am readye to take her life awaye. When he had ſaide thus, he tooke <hi>Cariclia</hi> by the hande, and made as thoughe he woulde haue carried her to the fire vpon the Aultars aboue, and deſired them to let the woordes that he ſpake take ſuch roote in their mindes, that they would ſuffer him to doo as he ſaide. The whole multitude of the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> was moued with this that he ſaide, &amp; would not ſuffer him to leade <hi>Cariclia</hi> one foote farther, but cried out ſuddainely alowde, ſaue the Mayde, ſaue the Bloude<note place="margin">Tokens that the people loued their Kinge well.</note> Royall, ſaue her whom the Goddes will haue ſaued, wée thanke you, you haue donne to vs ſo muche as the Lawe requireth, wée acknowledge you for our good Kinge, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge your ſelfe to be a Father, the Gods foregeue
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:6393:144"/>
vs this offence, you ſhal more diſpleaſe them if you with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their wil: let no man be ſo bold as to kil her, whom they haue preſerued: you that are y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Father of the people abroad, be Father in your owne houſe at home alſo. And ſixe hundred thinges like theſe ſpake they to him.

But he ſtanding neare to <hi>Cariclia,</hi> ſaide: Déere Daughter, that thou arte my child, bothe by toke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s is proued, &amp; wiſe <hi>Siſimithres</hi> beareth wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but aboue al, the fauour of the Gods hath declared. But what felowe is this, that was taken with thee, and is nowe at the Aultare ready to be ſacrificed, or howe did you cal him your Brother when you were broughte into my preſence at <hi>Siene</hi> firſt? For I thinke that he ſhal not be proued my Sonne too. For <hi>Perſina</hi> had no more but you at one time. <hi>Cariclia</hi> bluſhed, &amp; caſte downe her eies, and ſaide: I tolde you an vntroth in that I ſaide he was my Brother, but neceſſity forced me to make that excuſe. But what he is in déede, he can tell you better then I: for he is a man, &amp; therefore wil not be afraide to ſpeake more boldely then I that am a wooman. <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> not percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge what ſhée meant, ſaide: My Daughter, pardon me, becauſe I haue cauſed thée to bluſhe in aſkinge thée a que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, whereto a mayde oughte not anſweare. But ſitte you in the Tabernacle with your Mother, who will be more gladde of you nowe, then when you were borne of her, and whereas ſhée is ill at eaſe, comfort her with your preſence, and tel her your affayres. I wil ſée to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and ſéeke out ſomme other mayde, if there be any
<pb facs="tcp:6393:145"/>
to be found, that in your ſtéede may be ſacrificed with the yonge man. <hi>Cariclia</hi> almoſte cried out, when ſhée hearde<note place="margin">Cariclia by many circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth her Loue, but her Father vnderſtandeth her not.</note> that the yonge man ſhoulde be Sacrificed: yet (becauſe it was beſt) with muche adoo ſhée concealed her madde affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and touched the marke againe almoſte, and ſaide: Sir, you ſhal not néede to ſéeke any other wooman, ſéeing the people haue remitted throughe me that parte of the Sacrifice. But if any require it, you ſhal not onely ſéeke an other wooman, but an other man too: if you doo not, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> muſte you Sacrifice none other but me with him. God forbid (ſaide he). But why ſaie you ſo? Shée anſweared, becauſe that the Goddes haue appointed that I muſte bothe liue, and die with this man. <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> not yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing the effect of the matter, ſaide: Daughter, I praiſe this your courteſie, in that you haue pity vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this <hi>Greeke</hi> ſtraunger, and your felowe, with whom in your iourney you haue fallen acquainted, and deſire to ſaue him. But he cannot be deliuered from this offeringe. For nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pitie, nor Religion will admitte that the cuſtome of our Country be al broken as concerning the makinge of ſacrifice for victory: beſide this the people wil not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, which ſcant was moued by the goodnes of the Gods to pitie thée. Then ſaide <hi>Cariclia, ô</hi> Kinge, for perhaps I may not cal you Father, if the gentleneſſe of the Goddes hathe ſaued my body, lette the ſame gentleneſſe alſo ſaue my harte, who is my harte. Theſe Goddes whiche haue by fatal deſtiny appointed this doo knowe very wel. But if this wil not be graunted, and that the ſlaughter of this ſtraunger muſt néedes adourne this Offeringe. Graunt me one requeſte, let me kill the Sacrifice, and I will get me a name of ſtouteneſſe emong the <hi>Aethiopians,</hi> with a Swoorde whiche ſhal be the greateſt thinge, and déereſt that euer you ſhall be hable to geue me. <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> was troubled with this, &amp; ſaide: I vnderſtande not what this contrarietie in your minde meaneth: who euen nowe did goe aboute to defende, and ſaue the ſtraunger, and nowe
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:6393:145"/>
would with your owne hande kil him, as if he were your mortall enimy: neither doo I ſée what honeſtie or glory can be in this facte, for one of your age: but put caſe there were, yet maye you not by the Lawe, for this is onely lawfull for the Prieſtes of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> and <hi>Moone,</hi> and that not to all, but to the man that hath a wife, and the wife that hath a Huſbande. Seinge it is ſo your Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie wil not lette you haue your requeſt, whiche where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon it ſhould growe, I cannot tell. Truely ſaide <hi>Cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clia</hi> to <hi>Perſina</hi> in her eare, that néede not to lette me, for if you wilbe content Mother, there is one that can ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that name wel yenough. Wée will be content ſaide <hi>Perſina</hi> merily, and God willinge wée wil Marry thée to ſuche a one, as wée ſhal thinke woorthy bothe for you and vs. <hi>Cariclia</hi> ſpake more plainely, you néede not chooſe him that is chooſen already, and as ſhée was aboute to ſaie ſommewhat more openly (for the preſent perill that ſhée ſawe <hi>Theagenes</hi> in before her face imboldened her, and made her laie aſide her Maydenly ſhamefaſtneſſe). <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſpes</hi> would heare her no longer, but ſaide <hi>ô</hi> yée Gods, howe ſéeme you to mingle euill thinges, and good togea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to vs, that you may leſſen one waie or other this vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked for felicity of mine, in as much as you haue geuen me a Daughter, that I thought not vpon, but haue made her in manner madde: for ſhal wée not iudge her fooliſh, that ſpeake too fonde thinges? Shée called him her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that was not ſo. When ſhée was aſked what this ſtraunger was, ſhée anſweared, ſhée knew him not: then ſought ſhée to ſaue him as her Friende, whom ſhée knew not: whiche when it was denied her, ſhée beſought me that ſhée might kill him as her moſte enimy. When this coulde not be graunted her, becauſe it was lawfull for none to doo it, but ſuche a one as had a Huſbande, ſhée ſaide that ſhée was Married, and named not to whome. How can ſhée haue a Huſbande, whom the fire declared had neuer to doo with her? excepte this doo erre in her

alone, which is the ſureſt rule that the <hi>Aethiopians</hi> haue, and neuer yet was proued contrary, and would geue her grace, when ſhée trode vpon it, to be vnburned though ſhee had loſte her Maydenhead. At fewe woordes I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer ſawe any but ſhée, that made the ſame ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> her friend, and enimy in one minute of an hower, and fained to haue a Brother, and Huſbande, whiche neuer was ſo. Wherefore wife goe you into the Tabernacle, and ſée if you can bringe her to her wittes againe, whiche is either made madde of the God that commeth to this Sacrifice, or els is beſide her ſelfe with too muche ioye, for the good lucke that ſhée looked not for.

Neither did <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> tarry in his ſeate, but aroſe to welcome him, and imbraced him with a Father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affection, and ſette him beſide him, and takinge him by the right hande, ſaide: My Sonne you come in good time, you ſhall beſide celebration of this ſolemne Sacrifice, with me for my Victory, be Royally Married.

After the Kinge ſawe that none woulde come foorth, though he had made diuers proclamations, he ſaid: You ſhal haue a gifte of vs like youre ſelfe. And then he commaunded to fetche an olde Elephante, which was very greate. When the beaſt was broughte, he receiued it gladly, and the people ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainely fel in a greate laughter beinge wel pleaſed with the Kinges ciuilitie: mary after they had laughed, and ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted yenough, it ſéemed they were aſhamed of their facte.

that helde them, and ranne aboute as faſte as they coulde, mary they coulde not breake out of the compaſſe of the Armie, becauſe the Souldiers with their ſhieldes had made, as it were a wall rounde, but they ranne here and there, and ouerthrewe all that ſtoode in their waie, were it veſſel or any thinge els, ſo that there was a great ſhoute, as well of thoſe to whome they came for feare, as alſo for ioye and pleaſure that other had to ſée them ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne their mates, and treade them vnder their féete. Wherefore <hi>Perſina</hi> and <hi>Cariclia,</hi> coulde not be quiet in there Tabernacle, but commaunded to drawe the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine aſide, and looked vpon that, that befel.

But by that he did af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they ſawe he did it not for feare, nor to auoide the Sacrifiſinge: for when he had ouertaken the Bull, in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhorte time, he tooke him by the tayle, and draue him forwarde of pourpoſe, to wery him in making him runne faſter, whiche way ſo euer he wente, he followed after him, and with greate ſkill ſo tooke héede to his ſhorte turnes, that they hurte him not. After he had acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Bull with this, he rode at his ſide, ſo neare that their ſkinnes touched, and theire breathes and ſweatte were mingled togeather, &amp; he made them kéepe ſo equall

And vpon this looked al the people: but when <hi>Cariclia</hi> ſaw it, ſhée trembled &amp; quaked, becauſe ſhée knew not what he meant, and was as ſore afraide of his hurte, if he ſhoulde by ill hap haue a fall, as if ſhée ſhould haue ben ſlaine her ſelfe, ſo that <hi>Perſina</hi> eſpied it, &amp; ſaide: Daughter, what lackeſt thou?

But Mother, if you maye ſaue the man, you doo me a pleaſure. <hi>Perſina</hi> not ſuſpectinge the trothe, but that ſhée was a litle in loue with him, ſaide: Although he may not be ſaued, yet be not afraide to tell thy Mother what acquaintaunce thou haſte with him, why thou ſhouldeſt be ſo careful for him, though in déede this be a youthfull motion, and ſeante conuenient for a mayde?

As ſhée had ſaide thus, and was aboute to tell her the matter truely, ſhée was ſtopped by a greate crie of the people againe. For <hi>Theagenes,</hi> after he had lette the Horſe runne as faſte as he coulde, ſo longe till his breaſte was equall with the

Bulles heade, he let him goe at libertie, and fell vpon the Bulles heade betwéene his hornes, and caſte his armes aboute his heade like a Garlande, and claſped his fingers on his forehead before, and let the reſte of his body hange downe by the righte ſhoulder of him, ſo that the Bull in goinge hurte him a litle. After <hi>Theagenes</hi> perceiued that he was weary with the greate burthen, and his muſcules were fainte with too muche trauell, and that he came before the place where <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> ſate, he turned him ſelfe before, and ſet his féete before the Bull, who beatte vpon his houfes ſtill, and ſo tripped him. He beinge let of his courſe, and ouercomme with the ſtreangthe of the yonge man, fell downe vpon his heade and ſhoulders, ſo that his hornes ſtucke ſo faſte in the grounde, that he coulde not moue his heade, and his féete ſtoode vpwarde, with whiche he ſprauled in vaine a greate while, and by his féebleueſſe declared that he was ouercomme. <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> laye vpon him, and with his leafte hande helde him downe, but lifted his right hande vp to Heauen, and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked merily vpon <hi>Hidaſpes,</hi> and al that were there els, who laughed, and were much delighted with that ſight, and they hearde that the Bull with his lowinge declared the famouſneſſe of the Victory, as wel as if it had benne declared with a Trumpet. On the other ſide was a great ſhoute of the people, that ſaide plainely nothinge that one coulde vndeſtande to his praiſe, but with their wide throtes, and gapinge mouthes (as in like aſſemblies doth oft happen) thei ſéemed to extol him to the Heauens with one conſente.

And as <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> was aboute to ſaie ſomewhat to <hi>Thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes,</hi> the people bothe delited with the yonge man, and ſingularly minded to him, euer ſince they ſawe him firſt, and alſo maruailinge at his ſtrength, but rather for ſpite

What you meane (ꝙ <hi>Hidaſpes</hi>) to talke of <hi>Cariclia</hi> I know not, but you muſte wraſtle, &amp; not fighte with weapon, becauſe it is not lawfull to ſée any bloude ſhedde before the Sacrifice be donne. Then <hi>Theagenes</hi> perceiued that <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> doubted leaſt he ſhould be ſlaine, and ſaide: you doo well to kéepe me for the Goddes, and they ſhal haue reſpect to my buſineſſe. And then he tooke<note place="margin">Theagenes wraſtleth with Meroebus his man, and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth him.</note> duſte, and caſte it vpon his armes and ſhoulders that were yet ſweaty with the chaſinge of the Bull, and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked that of, that it ſtocke not faſte to his body, and then ſtretched foorthe his handes, and tooke ſome footinge, and bente his legges a litle, and ſtouped lowe, at a woorde all partes of his body were ready, ſo that he ſtoode, and with greate deſire awayted for the aduantage at the cloſe. The <hi>Aethiopian</hi> ſeing this laughed irefully, and trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed ſcornefully vpon him: and ranne ſuddainely vpon him, and with his elbowe hit <hi>Theagenes</hi> in the necke, as ſore as if he had ſiriken him with a leauer, &amp; then drewe backe, and laughed againe at his owne fooliſhe conceite.
<pb facs="tcp:6393:150"/>
But <hi>Theagenes</hi> like a man alway fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> his cradel brought vp in wraſtlinge, and throughly inſtructed in <hi>Mercuries</hi> Arte, thought it good to geue place at firſte, &amp; take ſome triall of his aduerſaries ſtrength, and not to withſtande ſo rude a violence, but with Arte to delude the ſame. Therefore he ſtouped lower, and made ſemblaunce as though he had benne very ſorrowful, and layde his other ſide to receiue the nexte blowe. And when the <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pian</hi> came vpon him againe, he made as though he would haue fallen flatte vpon his face: But as ſoone as the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopian</hi> beganne to deſpiſe him, and was incouraged well, and came vnaduiſedly the thirde time, and lifted vp his arme againe to take holde of him, and puttinge his right arme vnder his leafte ſide, and by liftinge vp his hande, ouerthrewe him on a heape, and caſtinge him ſelfe vnder his arme pittes, gryped this gorbelly with muche adoo, and forced him with his héeles to fall on his knées, and then leapte on his backe, and claſpinge his féete about his priuie partes, made him ſtreatche out his legges, wherewith he did ſtaie vp him ſelfe, and pulled his armes ouer his heade behinde him, and layde his bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flatte vpon the earthe. For this facte the people gaue a greater ſhoute then they did before, and the Kinge him ſelfe coulde ſtaie no longer, but ſtarte from his ſeate, and ſayde: <hi>ô</hi> hatefull neceſſitie, what a man are wée for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to kill by our Lawe? and when he had called him vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, he ſaide: Yonge man there lacketh nothinge, but that thou be Crowned before the Sacrifice: Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly this thy famous, and notable Victory, but vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and not continuall to thée, deſerueth a Crowne. But for as muche as I cannot deliuer thée from this preſente perill though I woulde, yet will I doo all that I may for thée, without breache of the Lawes. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with he put a Crowne of Golde vpon <hi>Theagenes</hi> heade, and diuers men did ſée him wéepe. Theagenes ſaide, then

I require you to let me obteine this requeſt at your hand accordinge as you haue promiſed. If there be no waie to eſcape this murtheringe, commaunde me to be killed by the hande of her that is found your Daughter to day. <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> was bytten with this woorde, and conſidered <hi>Cariclias</hi> requeſte, whiche was like this, yet he iudged it no greate matter to ſcanne it narrowly at that time, and ſaide: Straunger, I bad thée aſke that whiche might be graunted, and I promiſed to perfourme it: beſide, the Lawe preciſely willeth, that ſhée that killeth the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſhould haue a Huſbande.

The fire declareth that ſhée is a Mayde vnmarried, and neuer had to doo with man, excepte you meane this <hi>Meroebus</hi> (I cannot tell howe you ſhoulde come by knowledge thereof) whiche is not yet her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande, but I haue promiſed her to him.

Therefore if you will, let one carry him to the Aultare, and when you haue diſpatched your other matter that you haue in hande, then may you goe aboute the Sacrifice. Then was <hi>Theagenes</hi> carried as commaundement was geuen. But <hi>Cariclia,</hi> who was comforted a litle becauſe of his victory, and hoped for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lucke. But when ſhée ſawe him leadde away, was then in ſorrow againe, and <hi>Perſina</hi> comforted her diuers waies, and tolde her that he mighte happen to be ſaued, if ſhée woulde tell her the reſte more plainely. <hi>Cariclia</hi> ſéeinge the time would permit her to driue of no longer,

They ſhewed him a certaine Old man, to whom he ſaid:<note place="margin">Caricles com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth into Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia to ſeeke Cariclia.</note> ſtraunger I will doo any thinge at <hi>Oroondates</hi> requeſt, but I commaunded tenne onely to be brought hither, &amp; for as muche as one of them is knowen not to be thine, looke vpon all the reſte, if thou canſt finde her take her with thée. The Old man fell downe and kiſſed his féete, &amp; after he had looked vpon them al, as they were brought before him, and founde her not whom he ſought he was very ſadde, and ſaide none of theſe <hi>ô</hi> Kinge is ſhée. You know (ꝙ <hi>Hidaſpes</hi>) there is no wante of good will in me, if you finde her not that you ſéeke for, blame Fortune. For I geue you leaue to looke that neither hers is any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beſide theſe, nor in the Tentes: when the Olde man had bente his browes and wepte, he lifte vp his face, and looked rounde about him, and ſuddainely ranne foorth as though he had benne madde. And when he came to the Aultare he did winde his cloke rounde like a rope (for he had a cloke on then by chaunce) &amp; caſt it about <hi>Theagenes</hi> necke, and cried that all men might heare: I haue founde thée mine enimy, I haue gotten thée thou miſchieuous &amp; accurſed fellowe: And although the Officers would haue ſtaied him, and plucked him from him, he hanged ſo faſte vpon him, that he obtained leaue to bring him before <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſpes,</hi> and the Councell. And there he ſpake thus: This man, <hi>ô</hi> Kinge, is he who like a Théefe hath taken my Daughter from me, this is he who hath made my houſe deſolate, &amp; without any childe, he hath taken my harte e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen from the Aultars of <hi>Apollo.</hi> And nowe he ſitteth at the Aultars of the Goddes like a good and deuoute man. Al that were there were moued with that whiche he did, Mary thei vnderſtoode not his woordes, but they maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at his woorke. And when <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> badde him tell plainely what he meante: The Old man (that was <hi>Cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles</hi>) concealed the truthe of <hi>Cariclia,</hi> fearinge leaſt if ſhée were dead by the waye, that he ſhoulde haue muche adoo

with her trewe Parentes. But he tolde that briefely that was little hurtefull in this ſorte: I had a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,<note place="margin">Caricles telleth Hidaſpes howe Cariclia came out of Greece.</note> 
                  <hi>ô</hi> Kinge, if you had ſéene howe wiſe, and faire with all, ſhée had benne, you woulde haue thought that I had good cauſe to ſaie as I doo: Shée leade her life in Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, &amp; was one of <hi>Dianas</hi> Prieſtes, whiche is honoured at <hi>Delphi:</hi> That Mayde this iolly <hi>Theſſalian,</hi> hath ſtolen out of <hi>Apolloes</hi> Churche: as he came beinge Captaine of a holy Ambaſſage to <hi>Delphi</hi> my Natiue Cittie there to celebrate a certaine Feaſte. Wherefore it may well be déemed that he hathe offended alſo againſte you, for that he hathe diſpleaſed youre God <hi>Apollo</hi> (whiche is all one with the <hi>Sunne</hi>) and defiled his Temple. Furthermore a falſe Prieſte of <hi>Memphis</hi> was his companion in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmance of this his ſhameful, and heinous facte. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I had benne in <hi>Theſſalia,</hi> and required to haue this felowe, and they were all contente to deliuer him to me as a common plague of their Countrie, where ſo euer he were founde. I wente to <hi>Memphis,</hi> whiche I déemed to be a place whither <hi>Calaſiris</hi> woulde goe, for diuers cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. When I came thither, I founde him deade, as well he had deſerued, and was tolde by his Sonne <hi>Thyamis,</hi> of all that belonged to my Daughter: how that ſhée was ſente to <hi>Siene</hi> to <hi>Oroondates,</hi> where not findinge <hi>Oro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ondates</hi> (for I came thither too). At <hi>Eliphantina</hi> I was taken priſoner, and ſtaied: from whence I came at this preſente in humble ſorte to ſéeke my Daughter, and you ſhall doo me (vnhappy man) a good turne, and a déede wel beſéeminge a Kinge, if you will accepte the Deputies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſte made in my behalfe. And then he helde his peace, and wepte bitterly to confirme that he ſaide. <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> turned to <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and what ſaie you to this (ꝙ he?) <hi>Theagenes</hi> anſweared, all that he hathe laide againſte me in this accuſation, is true: I am the thiefe, the vniuſt man, and the Robber. As touching him, yet haue I done

you a good turne. Therefore ſaide <hi>Hidaſpes,</hi> reſtoare that whiche is not your owne, that becauſe ye are vowed to the Goddes ye maye be a cleane, and glorious Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and not ſéeme to be pouniſhed for your offence.

Saeinge therefore you haue her, reſtoare her, for it is <hi>Cariclia,</hi> whom he alſo will confeſſe to be youre Daughter. No man coulde rule him ſelfe any longer, but they were diſordred in euery place. <hi>Siſimithres,</hi> who had withhelde him ſelfe a good while, for all that he knew the whole matter that was in handlinge, till it were boulted out, whiche by litle and litle came to lighte, then he came to them, and imbraced <hi>Caricles,</hi> and ſaide: Your Adoptiue Daughter, which I ones deliuered you, is wel founde, and knowen to be theire Daughter, whom you know your ſelfe well yenough. <hi>Cariclia</hi> alſo ranne out of the Tabernacle like a madde wooman, without regard what became of her kinde and age, and fell at <hi>Caricles</hi> féete, and ſaide: O Father, no leſſe déere to me, then thoſe that begat me, take what reuenge you wil of me, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regarde to the excuſe, whiche ſomme man might alleage that it was the Goddes will, and theire dooinge. <hi>Perſina</hi> on the other ſide kiſſed <hi>Hidaſpes,</hi> and ſaide: Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, iudge that all this is ſo, and be ſure that this yonge <hi>Greeke</hi> is youre Daughters Huſbande. The people in an other place reioiced, and almoſte daunced for ioie, and with one conſente were all gladde of that whiche was donne: mary all they vnderſtoode not, but gathered the moſte parte of <hi>Cariclia.</hi> Perhappes alſo they were ſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to vnderſtande the trothe by inſpiration of the Gods, whoſe will it was that this ſhoulde fall out woonderful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as in a Comedy. Surely they made very contrarye thinges agrée, and ioined ſorrowe and mirthe, teares and laughter togeather, and tourned fearefull, and terrible
<pb facs="tcp:6393:153"/>
thinges into a ioyfull Banquette in the ende, many that wepte beganne to laughe, and ſuche as were ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowfull to reioice, when they founde that they ſoughte not for, and loſte that they hoped to finde, and to be ſhorte the cruell ſlaughters whiche were looked for euery moment, were turned into holy Sacrifice. Then ſaide <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> to <hi>Siſimithres:</hi> Right wiſe man what muſte wée doo? to refuſe the Sacrifice of the Gods is a wicked acte, but to offer them whiche they haue prouided for vs is the duety of deuaute men: wée muſte therefore bethinke vs what is beſte to doo. Whereto <hi>Siſimithres</hi> anſweared not in <hi>Greeke,</hi> but in the <hi>Aethiopian</hi> tongue, that all might<note place="margin">Too muche ioye blindeth the wiſeſt men of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes.</note> vnderſtande him, thus: Through too muche pleaſure, ô Kinge, the wiſeſt menne are oftentimes blinded, you mighte haue perceiued at the firſte that the Goddes li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked not the Sacrifice whiche was ordeined, who haue nowe euery waie declared that happy <hi>Cariclia</hi> is your Daughter euen at the very Aulters, and haue brought him, that brought her vp, out of the middeſt of <hi>Greece,</hi> as it had benne of pourpoſe: They haue feared and troubled the Horſes and Bullockes too, that ſtoode before the Aul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, whereby they declared that the greater Sacrifices, whiche haue benne vſed emonge our Aunceſters ſhoulde nowe ceaſe, and be vſed no more. And beſide, declared this yonge <hi>Greeke</hi> to be the Maydes Huſbande, whiche may be the ende and concluſion of this Comedie. Lette vs therefore ſuffer theſe diuine Miracles to ſinke in our mindes, and be healpers of theire will, and doo more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable Sacrifices to them, and leaue murtheringe of menne, and woomen for euer hereafter. After <hi>Siſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thres</hi> had ſaide thus ſo lowde that all mighte heare him. <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> who vnderſtoode alſo the tonge wherein he ſpake, tooke vp <hi>Theagenes</hi> and <hi>Cariclia,</hi> and ſayde: Sée<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge that theſe thinges benne thus appointed by the wil and pleaſure of the Goddes, I thinke (howe ſéemeth it
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:6393:153"/>
to you that be here alſo) that it is not good to ſtriue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſte them: Wherefore before them who haue preor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained this, and you alſo whiche ſéeme with your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente to followe their fates and deſtintes, I wiſhe that<note place="margin">Theagenes and Cariclia, are married by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſente of Hyda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpes, and are made Prieſtes, he the Sunnes, and ſhee the Moones.</note> theſe twoo may increaſe and growe in wedlocke, and geue them leaue to reioyce either other, that they maye engender and haue Children. And if you ſhall thinke it good lette this decrée be confirmed with Sacrifice, and lette vs fall to woorſhippinge of the Goddes. The Army conſented thereto, and with clappinge their handes gaue a Signe that they were contented with the matche. <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> then came to the Aulters, and ready to beginne Sacrifice, ſaide thus: O <hi>Sunne</hi> our Lorde, and Lady <hi>Moone,</hi> for as muche as <hi>Theagenes,</hi> and <hi>Cariclia</hi> are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be Man and Wife by your good willes, I am ſure you will accepte of theire Offeringes, and ſuffer them to doo Sacrifice to you. This ſaide, he tooke of his owne Miter, and <hi>Perſinas,</hi> which were the notes of their Prieſthoode, and ſette one vpon <hi>Theagenes</hi> head, whiche was his owne, and the other vpon <hi>Cariclias</hi> that was <hi>Perſinas.</hi> When this was donne, <hi>Caricles</hi> remembred him ſelfe of the Oracles anſweare at <hi>Delphi,</hi> and ſawe that fulfilled in déede, whiche was promiſed before of the Goddes. Whiche was, that after they fledde from <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi, they ſhoulde come at lengthe to Countrie ſcortche, with burninge <hi>Phebus</hi> beames:</hi>

               </lg>
               <p>Thus after they had on theſe white Miters, and were made Prieſtes by the voice, and opinion of <hi>Hidaſpes,</hi> aud had donne Sacrifice very well, they roade in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riottes drawen with Horſes, <hi>Hidaſpes</hi> and <hi>Cariclia</hi> in one, <hi>Siſimithres</hi> and <hi>Caricles</hi> in an other, and <hi>Perſina</hi>
