            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Epistle Dedicatory, TO Mr. <hi>CARDELL GOODMAN.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THere are a sort of <hi>Spleenatic, Ill na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turd</hi> Gentlemen in the World, who are so very Critical upon <hi>Dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> that if they find the Author touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing never so lightly on the just Praise of his <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron,</hi> they presently condemn him of <hi>Flattery,</hi> as if 'twere impossible that any Man of THIS Age cou'd deserve a good Word. Among this number, I am sorry to find the Ingenious Sir <hi>George Mackenzie</hi> in his Epistle to Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> because I am confident if he had consulted <hi>Reason</hi> (the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his Book) he must at least have mollify'd the severity of his Opinion, as I hope will appear from what I have here to say. This great <hi>Name</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55621:3"/>
has serv'd many of the smaller Critics, who build their <hi>Judgment,</hi> and <hi>Reputation</hi> on Authority, as a safe Retreat against the Onsets of <hi>Reason,</hi> with which the Majority of them are at mortal odds. These <hi>Misanthropes</hi> are arriv'd to that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity now, that they will not give a Man leave to discover his own private <hi>Knowledg</hi> of an other, if to his Advantage, under the unpleasant Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of being receiv'd as a <hi>servile, nauseous Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Hazard, Sir, I must run, if I will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare in <hi>Public</hi> what I know of those excellent Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments, which render you so dear to all that are acquainted wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h you. Your WIT, and your <hi>Courage</hi> are things not to be mention'd, much less your GENEROSITY, that being a <hi>Vertue</hi> that never resides alone. There are some Vertues that are Solitary, and like Hermits dwell in Deserts, over-run with the <hi>Wilds</hi> of every <hi>vicious Deformity</hi> in Nature: But GENE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROSITY is the King of Vertues, and never goes unattended, which makes me sometimes fancy, 'tis the <hi>Result</hi> of all other Vertues, when they meet together; The <hi>Harmony,</hi> which proceeds from the <hi>Active</hi> Agreement of all the rest. This I am sure,—'tis the noblest Emotion of the Soul, and that which gives the most finishing, and visible Stroaks to the
<pb facs="tcp:55621:3"/>
Image of our <hi>Maker.</hi> Therefore these morose Gentlemen would never forgive me, if I should tell the World, that you are Generous almost to a Fault (if 'twere possible that could be criminal in <hi>Man,</hi> for which alone all the World does, and ever has worship'd a <hi>Deity</hi>) tho' I know it to be true to the utmost Extent; because that will make the considering part of Mankind conclude you adorn'd with all other Vertues, inseparable Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions of this. They will never consider the Reasons I have to aver this, <hi>viz.</hi> my own Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and the Experience of several others And tho' I urge, that I have found you Generous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the extravagance of Hopes, when the Bonds of <hi>Nature,</hi> the Laws of <hi>Humanity,</hi> and of <hi>God himself,</hi> could not obtain the least regard from those, who had not a little Reputation in the World for better Principles: Yet will they cry out I am a FLATTERER, if I express my Gratitude to you in Print. Strange effects of a profligate Age, when ill Nature and profess'd Scandal, dress'd in a Politer sort of <hi>Bilingsgate,</hi> shall be sufficient to establish a Man's Fame (spite of all the most monstrous absurdities of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture) as a <hi>Wit</hi>: And the most deserv'd <hi>Praise</hi> enough to stigmatize the Writer with <hi>inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leble Infamy.</hi> For if any <hi>Bold Man</hi> dare ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the Vertues of any one, they gaze upon
<pb facs="tcp:55621:4"/>
him, and shake their Heads as if it were an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Imposture, or at best a Prodigy as incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as a circular Rainbow, or any other unusual <hi>Phaenomenon,</hi> that there should be any thing <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> and <hi>Brave</hi> in <hi>OUR Age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not that I am so very fond of this Opinion, that <hi>Vertues</hi> are in being at this time, and in the Practice of Men, as to take every <hi>appearance</hi> for a <hi>Reality.</hi> Nor do I admit a great many that pass for mighty Lovers of Vertue, into that number; in particular, none of those, that are fam'd for a noisy Zeal in the controverted Points of Religion, which prompts an inconsidering Generation to cut one another's Throats, because they can't agree in what themselves allow <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</hi> Nor those, who with a <hi>Precise Behaviour,</hi> make an Ostentatious Shew of being the most in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friends of God Almighty in Public, but shake Hands with the Devil in a corner with no little Ardor. Nor shall I grace with the noble Title of VERTVE, those sorts of <hi>Religious Charities,</hi> that have not the <hi>Equitable</hi> good of Mankind for their end, but only vain Glory in <hi>particular Reputation.</hi> I could name some, that are very forward in contributing largely to the Building any public Structure, which may commend their Names to Posterity, as well as to the present time, but are inexorable to the nearest
<pb facs="tcp:55621:4"/>
Relations who seek for a private Assistance, tho' a Trifle would save a whole Family. That which affects the view of the World, is the Child of Pride, and is not at all to be valu'd by any consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Man; the other is the Off-spring of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, having nothing but the good of another for its end, and yet it obtains generally a more last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fame, and especially if it meet with <hi>Ability</hi> and <hi>Gratitude</hi> to commend it to Posterity, in a nobler way, than in <hi>dead</hi> Piles of Building.</p>
            <p>Tho' I deny all this to be Vertue, yet I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be of their Mind, who exclude it intirely from <hi>Human Race,</hi> since I am sensible 'tis to be found in a great many at this day, particularly in <hi>your self.</hi> I am therefore of a much contrary Opinion, to those <hi>Man-haters</hi> I have mention'd those <hi>Devotes</hi> to Satyr (as they call it) for I have always thought it a far nobler Task to be conversant with the <hi>Vertues</hi> of Mankind, than with the <hi>Vices;</hi> and if Fiction must be made use of (as 'tis every day by our <hi>Prose-Satyrists</hi>) I am sure 'tis more reasonable to admire an Angel of our own forming, than to combat a Devil of ones own conjuring up; one gives us a greater, and juster Idea of the noblest of God's Works, the other flyes in the face of <hi>Providence,</hi> and wou'd render that Being ridiculous, and contemptible, that was made by the Power and Wisdom of
<pb facs="tcp:55621:5"/>
INFINITY, and which God seems more than once to take no small Pleasure in.</p>
            <p>The greatest Patrons of <hi>Satyr,</hi> I am sure, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove that it answers the End, they pretend, 'twas design'd for, viz. the <hi>Reformation of Vice,</hi> especially that <hi>Satyr,</hi> which names Men, and tends to a personal abuse. For instead of Reforming Vice it only gratifies the ill-nature of most, and that Criminal delight they have in hearing an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther abus'd, without any influence on the <hi>Manners</hi> of those it aims to Correct; unless it be to return the Author's with a Satyr of dry Bastinade. The Minds of all men have something, that is with more Modesty conceal'd, than expos'd to view, as well as the Body; which <hi>Satyr</hi> is continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly setting before the Eyes of the World; whilst <hi>Panegyric</hi> draws a decent Veil over it. <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyric</hi> paints <hi>Vertue,</hi> in its most taking Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, and shews the more Beautiful parts of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, whilst Satyr is continually raking in the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gean</hi> Stable of its <hi>Follies,</hi> and <hi>Vices. Panegyric</hi> gives a Noble, and taking prospect of <hi>Virtue,</hi> stir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up <hi>Emulation,</hi> in others, and a Caution in him that is <hi>Prais'd,</hi> not to be guilty of any thing contrary to the character the World has of him, that he may be thought really to deserve it. Nor can I ever believe, but that <hi>Virgils Aeneids</hi> have contributed more to the Progress of Vertue, than
<pb facs="tcp:55621:5"/>
               <hi>Horace's Satyrs:</hi> The first forming Noble images in the Mind, making it in Love with <hi>Honor,</hi> the last, at best exposing but the deformity of some <hi>Vice, or folly,</hi> which when we avoid we ramble so in the dark by their directions, that we can never find out <hi>Vertue,</hi> and so may well fall into the contrary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream; <hi>Satyr</hi> only giving negative definitions of <hi>Virtue,</hi> like <hi>Mr. Cowlys</hi> of <hi>Wit</hi>: But in <hi>Epic posie</hi> and <hi>Panegyric</hi> all goes in the <hi>clear,</hi> and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident</hi> affirmative, presenting so exact a portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Vertue,</hi> that you can't mistake, or not know it at first sight.</p>
            <p>But that which is most of all, <hi>Panegyric</hi> has the effectual force <hi>Satyr</hi> pretends to, in chacing away <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Folly,</hi> by discovering the <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> and <hi>Beauties</hi> of their contraries; and if it be plac'd on an undeserving Subject, it carries as se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere a Sting: For who is it that reads those Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of <hi>Lucan</hi> upon <hi>Nero,</hi> but thinks them a severe <hi>Satyr,</hi> tho they bear the Face of <hi>Praise</hi>—for having reckond up the Mischiefs of <hi>Civil War,</hi> he cries out—

            <p>This I am sure was the safest way of abusing that Prince. An extravagant Praise of one, that merits nothing, is the most effectual of <hi>Satyrs.

The Custom of the <hi>Lacedemonians</hi> of making their Slaves drunk, to represent to their Youth the Folly and Odiousness of that Vice, as it was proportion'd to the grossness of their Genius so it seems to have a likeness to <hi>Satyr,</hi> which pretends to put Vice out of Countenance, by exposing it, which it generally does in such terms, that it only pleases the vitiated Appetites of some with the lively descriptions of what they delight in. But <hi>Panegyric,</hi> like the Wiser State of <hi>Athens,</hi> gives us <hi>Examples,</hi> and descriptions of Vertue, justly imagining, that, where those Attractives, are no man can be drawn from <hi>Beauty</hi> to <hi>Deformity.</hi> 'Twoud be too tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to run this consideration of the Preheminence of <hi>Panegyrick</hi> to <hi>Satyr</hi> any farther, having said enough already (I hope) to satisfie any sensible man of the truth of what I assert.</p>

               <pb facs="tcp:55621:6"/>Having thus vindicated <hi>Panegyric</hi> from the Odium it lies under, and plac'd it in its due rank, nothing could hinder me from attempting one on you, Sir, who so e'ry way deserve it, but my <hi>Inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> which perswade me to say nothing of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence I value, since I am Conscious that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not say enough, nor perform that <hi>Task</hi> with the Wit and Eloquence it requires.</p>
            <p>As to the Book Sir, I present you with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I am extreamly satisfy'd to know, that it is a Present worth your acceptance; for I may say that there has scarce been a Collection which visited the World, with fewer trifling Verses in it.

            <head>AN Essay upon Satyr, FROM M. DACIER.</head>
            <p>EXpecting several Satyrs for this Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction more than I met with, I design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an Essay upon Satyr, as to its Etymology, Progress, and Vertues, with a short Examen of what we have had publish'd in <hi>English,</hi> in that Nature, and finally a Collation of that with the Ancient; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving a Discourse on that Subject would not be ungrateful to the Ingenious, as being both New, and Curious; which made me promise
<pb facs="tcp:55621:8"/>
my Bookseller to attempt it: But finding my self disappointed in my Expectations, I was of Opinion such an Essay would not be altogether so proper: But to make the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seller a large Amends (and to gratify the Town with an agreeable Entertainment) I got, of a very Ingenious Friend of Mine, this Preface of <hi>M. Dacier,</hi> to the sixth Tome of <hi>Horace,</hi> which tho it be not of that extent, as to take in all the Points I design'd to treat of, yet <hi>Horace</hi> being now in that just Esteem he deserves, I thought I could not better gratify his Admirers, than to let our English World see those hidden Beauties of this great Poet, discover'd by <hi>M. Dacier,</hi> with no less Wit, than Judgment.</p>

               <hi>HOrace</hi> entitles his two Books of Satyrs indifferently, <hi>Sermones,</hi> and <hi>Satyrae</hi>; And since these two Names give different Ideas; for certain Reasons it is necessary to explain what the <hi>Latins</hi> understood by the
<pb facs="tcp:55621:8"/>
Word <hi>Satyr.</hi> The Learned <hi>Casaubon</hi> is the first, and only Man that has with Success at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to shew what was the <hi>Satyrical Poesie</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the <hi>Satyr</hi> of the <hi>Romans.</hi> His Book is an inestimable Treasure, and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess I have had great Helps from it; which is the use we ought to make of the Works of those extraordinary Men, who have only gone before us to be our Guides, and serve us as Torches in the thick Darkness of Antiquity. But you must not have your Eyes so continually fixt on them, as not to regard whither they lead you; for they deviate sometimes into Paths, where you cannot safely follow them. This Rule I my self have observ'd, in forsaking my Guides, and past that Way which no Body before me has done, as the following Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course will convince you.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Satyr</hi> is a kind of Poesie, only known to the <hi>Romans,</hi> being not at all related to the <hi>Satyrical Poesie</hi> of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> as some learned Men have pretended. <hi>Quintilian</hi> leaves us no Doubt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Point, when he writes in Chap. 10. <hi>Satira quidem tota nostra est.</hi> The same Reason makes <hi>Horace</hi> call it in the last Satyr of Book 1. <hi>Graecis intactum Carmen.</hi> The Natural and true Etymology is this: The <hi>Latins</hi> called it <hi>SATVR, quasi plenum,</hi> to which there was
<pb facs="tcp:55621:9"/>
nothing wanting for its Perfection. Thus <hi>Satur color,</hi> when the Wool has taken a good Dye, and nothing can be added to the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of it. From <hi>Satur</hi> they have made <hi>Satura,</hi> which they wrote sometimes with an <hi>i, Satira</hi>; They used in other Words, the same Variation of the Letter <hi>u</hi> into <hi>i,</hi> as in <hi>Maxumus, Maximus, optumus, optimus. Satura,</hi> is an <hi>Adjective,</hi> which has reference to a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantive understood; for the Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> said <hi>Saturam,</hi> understanding <hi>Lancem.</hi> And <hi>Satura Lanx,</hi> was properly a Bason fill'd with all sorts of Fruit, which they offer'd every Year to <hi>Ceres,</hi> and <hi>Bacchus,</hi> as the First Fruits of all they had gathered. These Offerings of different things mixt together, were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who call'd 'em <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>a Sacrifice of all sorts of Fruit, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, an Offering of all sorts of Grain,</hi> when they offer'd Potherbs. The Grammarian <hi>Diomedes</hi> has perfectly describ'd both the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom of the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Word <hi>Satura,</hi> in this Passage <hi>Lanx referta variis multis<expan>

From thence the Word <hi>Satura</hi> was apply'd to many other Mixtures, as in <hi>Festus: Satira cibi genus, ex variis rebus conditum.</hi> From hence it past to the Works of the Mind; for they call'd some Laws <hi>Leges Saturas,</hi> which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd many Heads, or Titles, as the <hi>Iulian, Papian</hi> and <hi>Popean Laws,</hi> which were called <hi>Miscellas,</hi> which is of the same Signification with <hi>Satura</hi>: From hence arose this Phrase, <hi>Per Saturam legem ferre,</hi> when the Senate made a Law, without gathering, and counting the Votes in haste, and confusedly all together, which was properly call'd, <hi>Per Saturam sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentias exquirere,</hi> as <hi>Salust</hi> has it after <hi>Lelius.</hi> But they rested not here, but gave this Name to certain Books, as <hi>Pescennius Festus,</hi> whose Histories were call'd <hi>Saturas,</hi> or <hi>per Saturam.</hi> From all these Examples, 'tis not hard to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that these Works of <hi>Horace</hi> took from hence their Name, and that they were call'd, <hi>Saturae quia multis &amp; variis rebus hoc carmen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertum est,</hi> because <hi>these Poems are full of a great many different Things,</hi> as <hi>Porphyrius</hi> says, which is partly true. But it must not be thought it is immediately from thence; for this Name had been used before for other things, which bore a nearer resemblance to the Satyrs of <hi>Horace</hi>; in explanation of which a Method is to be follow'd, which <hi>Casaubon</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:55621:10"/>
himself never thought of, and which will put things in so clear a Light, that there can be no Place left for Doubt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> having been almost four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years without any <hi>Scenical Plays,</hi> Chance and Debauchery made them find in one of their <hi>Feasts</hi> the <hi>Saturnian,</hi> and <hi>Fescennine</hi> Verses, which for six score Years they had instead of <hi>Dramatic Pieces.</hi> But these Verses were rude, and almost without any Numbers, as being made <hi>extempore,</hi> and by a People, as yet but barbarous, who had little other Skill, than what flow'd from their Joy, and the Fumes of Wine. They were filled with the grossest sort of Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leries, and attended with Gestures and Dances. To have a livelier Idea of this, you need but reflect upon the honest <hi>Peasants</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whose clown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish Dances are attended with <hi>extempore</hi> Verses, in which, in a wretched manner they jeer one another, with all they know. To this <hi>Horace</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers in the first Epistle of his second Book,
<q>
                  <l>Fescennina per hunc inventa licentia morem,</l>
                  <l>Versibus alt ernis opprobia rustica fudit.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>This Licentious and Irregular Verse, was succeeded by a sort more correct, filled with a pleasant Railery, without the Mixture of any thing scurrilous, and these obtain'd the Name of Satyrs, by reason of their Variety, and had
<pb facs="tcp:55621:10"/>
regulated Forms, that is, regular Dances, and Music, but undecent Postures were banish'd. <hi>Titus Livius</hi> has it in his seventh Book. <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naculis artificibus, quia</hi> Hister <hi>Tusco verbo</hi> Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio <hi>vocabatur, nomen Histrionibus inditum, qui non sicut ante Fescennino versu similem compositum temere, ac rudem alternis jaciebant; sed imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas modis Satiras, descripto jam ad Tibicinem cantu, motus<expan>

                     <ex>que</ex>
                  </expan> congruenti peragebant.</hi> These Satyrs were properly honest Farces, in which the Spectators and Actors were rallied without Distinction.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Livius Andronicus</hi> found things in this po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture, when he first undertook to make Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and Tragedies in Imitation of the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</hi> This Diversion appearing more noble, and perfect, they run to it in Multitudes, neglecting the Satyrs for some time, though they receiv'd them a little after; and some model'd them into a purpos'd Form to act at the end of their Comedies, as the French act their Farces now. And then they alter'd their Name of Satyrs for that of <hi>Exodia,</hi> which they preserve to this day. This was the first and most ancient kind of <hi>Roman</hi> Satyr. There are two other sorts, which tho' very different from this first, yet both owe their Birth to this, and are, as it were, Branches of it. This I shall prove the most succinctly I can.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55621:11"/>A Year after <hi>Livius Andronicus</hi> had caus'd his first Efforts to be Acted, <hi>Italy</hi> gave birth to <hi>Ennius,</hi> who being grown up, and having all the leisure in the World to observe the eager Satisfaction with which the <hi>Romans</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd the Satyrs, of which I have already spoke, was of Opinion, that Poems, tho' not adapted to the <hi>Theatre,</hi> yet preserving the <hi>Gaul</hi> the <hi>Railings</hi> and Pleasantness, which made these Satyrs take with so much Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause, would not fail of being well receiv'd; he therefore ventur'd at it, and compos'd se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Discourses to which he retain'd the name of <hi>Satyrs.</hi> These Discourses were entirely like those of <hi>Horace,</hi> both for the Matter and the Variety. The only essential difference, that is observable, is that <hi>Ennius,</hi> in Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of some <hi>Greeks,</hi> and of <hi>Homer</hi> himself, took the liberty of mixing several kinds of Verses together, as <hi>Hexameters, Iambics, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters,</hi> with <hi>Tetrimeters, Trochaics</hi> or <hi>Square</hi> Verse; as it appears from the Fragments which are left us. These following Verses are of the <hi>Square</hi> kind, which <hi>Aullus Gellius</hi> has preserv'd us, and which very well merit a place here for the Beauty they contain:
<q>
                  <l>Hoc erit tibi Argumentum semper in prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptu situm,</l>

            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55621:11"/>I attribute also to these Satyrs of <hi>Ennius</hi> these other kinds of Verses, which are of a Beauty, and Elegance, much above the Age in which they were made; nor will the sight of 'em here be unpleasant.</p>

               <hi>Horace</hi> has borrow'd several things from these Satyrs. After <hi>Ennius</hi> came <hi>Pacuvius,</hi> who also writ Satyrs in Imitation of his Uncle <hi>Ennius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Lucilius</hi> was born in the time when <hi>Pacuvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> was in most Reputation. He also wrote Satyrs. But he gave 'm a new turn, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to imitate, as near as he could,
<pb facs="tcp:55621:12"/>
the Character of the old <hi>Greek</hi> Comedy, of which we had but a very imperfect <hi>Idea</hi> in the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Satyr, and such, as one might find in a Poem, which Nature alone had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctated before the <hi>Romans</hi> had thought of imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating the <hi>Grecians,</hi> and enriching them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with their Spoils. 'Tis thus you must understand this Passage of the first Satyr of the second Book of <hi>Horace,</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>—Quid, cum est Lucilius ausis,</l>
                  <l>Primus in hunc operis componere carmina morem?</l>
               </q>
               <hi>Horace</hi> never intended by this to say, That there were no Satyrs before <hi>Lucilius,</hi> because <hi>Ennius</hi> and <hi>Pacuvius</hi> were before him, whose Example he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed: He only would have it understood, That <hi>Lucilius</hi> having given a new Turn to this Poem, and embellished it, ought by way of Excellence to be esteemed the first Author. <hi>Quintilian</hi> had the same Thought, when he writ, in the first Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the tenth Book <hi>Satira quidem tota nostra est, in qua primus insignem laudem adeptus est</hi> Lucilius. You must not therefore be of the Opinion of <hi>Casaubon,</hi> who building on the Judgment of <hi>Diomedes,</hi> thought that the Satyr of <hi>Ennius,</hi> and that of <hi>Lucilius</hi> were entirely different: These are the very Words of this Grammarian, which have deceived this Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Critick. <hi>Satira est Carmen apud</hi> Romanos, <hi>non quidem apud</hi> Graecos <hi>maledicum, ad carpenda homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num vitia, Archaeae Comoediae charactere compositum, quale scripserunt</hi> Lucilius <hi>&amp;</hi> Horatius, <hi>&amp;</hi> Persius. <hi>Sed
<pb facs="tcp:55621:12"/>
olim Carmen quod ex variis Poematibus constabat, Satira dicebatur, quale scripserunt</hi> Pacuvius <hi>&amp;</hi> Ennius. You may see plainly that <hi>Diomedes</hi> distinguishes the Satyr of <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilius,</hi> from that of <hi>Ennius,</hi> and <hi>Pacuvius</hi>; the reason which he gives for this Distinction, is ridiculous, and absolutely false: The good Man had not examin'd the Nature and Origin of these two Satyrs, which were entirely like one another, both in Matter and Form, for <hi>Lucilius</hi> added to it only a little Politeness, and more Salt, almost without changing any thing: And if he did not put together several Sorts of Verse in the same Piece, as <hi>Ennius</hi> has done, yet he made se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Pieces, of which some were entirely <hi>Hexame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> others entirely <hi>Iambics,</hi> and others <hi>Trochaic</hi>'s, as is evident from his Fragments. In short, if the Satyrs of <hi>Lucilius</hi> differ from these of <hi>Ennius,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the former has added much to the Endeavours of the latter, as <hi>Casaubon</hi> has pretended, it will follow from thence, that those of <hi>Horace,</hi> and those of <hi>Lucilius,</hi> are also entirely different, for <hi>Horace</hi> has no less refin'd on the Satyrs of <hi>Lucilius,</hi> than he on those of <hi>Ennius,</hi> and <hi>Pacuvius.</hi> This Passage of <hi>Diomedes</hi> has also deceiv'd <hi>Dousa</hi> the Son. I say not this to expose some Light Faults of these great Men, but only to shew, with what Exactness, and with what Caution their Works must be read, when they treat of any thing so Obscure, and so ancient.</p>
            <p>I have made appear what was the Ancient Satyr, that was made for the <hi>Theatre</hi>; I have shewn, That that gave the Idea of the Satyr of <hi>Ennius</hi>: And, in fine, I have sufficiently prov'd, that the Satyrs of <hi>Ennius,</hi> and <hi>Pacuvius</hi>; of <hi>Lucilius,</hi> and <hi>Horace,</hi> are but one kind of Poem, which has received its Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the last. 'Tis Time now to speak of the

second kind of Satyr, which I promised to explain, and which is also derived from the Ancient Satyr; 'tis that which we call <hi>Varronian,</hi> or the Satyr of <hi>Menippus,</hi> the Cinic Philosopher.</p>
            <p>This Satyr was not only composed of several forts of Verse, but <hi>Varro</hi> added Prose to it, and made a Mixture of <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin. Quintilian,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he had spoke of the Satyr of <hi>Lucilius,</hi> adds, <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum illud est, &amp; prius Satirae genus, quod non sola Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum varietate mistum condidit</hi> Terentius Varro, <hi>vir Romanorum Eruditissimus.</hi> The only Difficulty of this Passage is, that <hi>Quintilian</hi> assures us, that this Satyr of <hi>Varro</hi> was the first, for how could that be, since <hi>Varro</hi> was a great while after <hi>Lucilius? Quintilian</hi> meant not that the Satyr of <hi>Varro</hi> was the first in Order of Time, for he knew well enough, that in that respect he was the last: But he would give us to understand, that this kind of <hi>Satyr,</hi> so mixt, was more like the <hi>Satyr</hi> of <hi>Ennius,</hi> and <hi>Pacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius,</hi> who gave themselves a greater Liberty in this Composition, than <hi>Lucilius,</hi> who was more severe, and correct.</p>
            <p>We have now only some Fragments left of the Satyr of <hi>Varro,</hi> and those generally very imperfect; the Titles, which are most commonly double, shew the great Variety of Subjects, of which <hi>Varro</hi> treated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Book on the Death of <hi>Claudius, Boetius,</hi> his <hi>Consolation of Philosophy,</hi> and that of <hi>Petronius Arbiter,</hi> are Satyrs entirely like those of <hi>Varro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is what I have in general to say on <hi>Satyr</hi>; nor is it necessary I insist any more on this Subject. This the Reader may observe, that the Name of <hi>Satyr</hi> in Latin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is not less proper for Discourses,
<pb facs="tcp:55621:13"/>
that recommend Vertue, than to those which are design'd against Vice. It had nothing so formidable in it, as it has now, when a bare Mention of Satyr makes them tremble, who would fain seem what they are not, for Satyr, with us, signifies the same thing, as <hi>exposing,</hi> or <hi>lashing</hi> of some thing, or Person: Yet this different Acceptation alters not the Word, which is always the same; but the <hi>Latins</hi> in the Titles of their Books, have often had regard only to the Word, in the extent of its Signification, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on its Etymology, whereas we have had respect only to the first, and general Use, which has been made of it in the beginning to <hi>mock,</hi> and <hi>deride</hi>; yet this Word ought always to be writ in <hi>Latin</hi> with an (<hi>u</hi>) or <hi>(i) Satura,</hi> or <hi>Satira,</hi> and in English by an (<hi>i</hi>) those who have wrote it with a (<hi>y</hi>) thought with <hi>Scaliger, Heinsius,</hi> and a great many others, that the Divinities of the Groves, which the <hi>Grecians</hi> call'd <hi>Satyrs,</hi> the <hi>Romans Fawns,</hi> gave their Names to these Pieces; and that of the Word <hi>Satyrus</hi> they had made <hi>Satyra,</hi> and that these Satyrs had a great affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity with the Satyric Pieces of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which is absolutely false, as <hi>Casaubon</hi> has very well prov'd it, in making it appear, That of the Word <hi>Satyrus</hi> they could never make <hi>Satyra,</hi> but <hi>Satyrica</hi>: And in shewing the Difference betwixt the Satyric Poems of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and the <hi>Roman</hi> Satyrs. Mr. <hi>Spanheim,</hi> in his fine Preface to the <hi>Caesars,</hi> concerning the Emperor <hi>Iulian,</hi> has added new Reflections to those which this Judicious Critic had advanced; and he has establish'd, with a great deal of Judgment, five, or six essential Differences, between those two Poems, which you may find in his Book. The <hi>Greeks</hi> had never any thing that came near this Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:55621:14"/>
Satyr, but their <hi>Silli</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>] which were also biting Poems, as they may easily be perceived to be yet, by some Fragments of the <hi>Silli</hi> of <hi>Timon.</hi> There was however this Difference, That the <hi>Silli</hi> of the Greeks were <hi>Parodious,</hi> from one End to the other, which cannot be said of the <hi>Roman</hi> Satyrs; where, if sometimes you find some <hi>Parodia's,</hi> you may plainly see that the Poet did not design to affect it, and by consequence the <hi>Parodia</hi>'s do not make the Essence of a Satyr, as they do the Essence of the <hi>Silli.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having explain'd the Nature, Origin and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of <hi>Satyr,</hi> I'll now say a Word, or two of <hi>Horace</hi> in particular.</p>
            <p>There cannot be a more just Idea given of this part of his Works, than in comparing them to the Statues of the <hi>Sileni,</hi> to which <hi>Alcibiades</hi> in the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, compares <hi>Socrates.</hi> They were Figures, that without had nothing agreeable, or beautiful, but when you took the Pains to open them, you found the Figures of all the Gods. In the manner that <hi>Horace</hi> presents himself to us in his Satyrs, we dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover nothing of him at first, that deserves our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment. He seems to be fitter to amuse Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren than to employ the Thoughts of Men; but when we remove that, which hides him from our Eyes, and view him even to the Bottom, we find in him all the Gods together; that is to say, all those Vertues, which ought to be the continual Practice of such as seriously endeavour to forsake their Vices.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have been content to see only his out-side, and 'tis a strange thing, that Satyrs, which have been read so long, have been so little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, or explain'd: They have made a Halt at the
<pb facs="tcp:55621:14"/>
out-side, and were wholly busi'd in giving the Interpretation of Words. They have commented upon him like Grammarians, not Philosophers; as if <hi>Horace</hi> had writ meerly to have his Language un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, and rather to divert, than instruct us. That is not the End of this Work of his. The end of any Discourse is the Action for which that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course is compos'd; when it produces no Action, 'tis only a vain amusement, which idly tickles the Ear, without ever reaching the Heart.</p>
            <p>In these two Books of his Satyrs, <hi>Horace</hi> would teach us, <hi>to conquer our Vices, to rule our Passions, to follow Nature, to limit our Desires, to distinguish True from False, and Ideas from Things, to forsake Prejudice, to know throughly the Principles, and Motives of all our Actions, and to shun that Folly which is in all Men, who are bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted to the Opinions they have imbibed under their Teachers, which they keep obstinately without examining whether they are well-grounded.</hi> In a Word, <hi>he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to make us happy for our selves, agreeable, and faithful to our Friends, easie, discreet, and honest to all, with whom we are oblig'd to live.</hi> To make us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand the Terms he uses, to explain the Figures he employs, and to conduct the Reader safely through the Labyrinth of a difficult Expression, or obscure <hi>Parenthesis,</hi> is no great matter to perform: And as <hi>Epictetus</hi> says, there is nothing in that Beautiful, or truly worthy a wise Man. The principal, and most important Business, is to shew the Rise, the Reason, and the Proof of his Precepts, to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate that those, who do not endeavour to correct themselvs by so beautiful a Model, are just like sick Men, who having a Book full of Receipts, proper to their Distempers, content themselves to read 'em,
<pb facs="tcp:55621:15"/>
without comprehending them, or so much as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Advantage of them.</p>
            <p>I urge not this because I have my self omitted any thing in these Annotations, which was the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent Duty of a Grammarian to observe; this, I hope the World will be sensible of, and that there remains no more Difficulty in the Text. But that which has been my chief Care, is, to give an insight into the very matter, that <hi>Horace</hi> treats of, to shew the solidity of his Reasons, to discover the Turns he makes use of to prove what he aims at, and to refute or illude that which is opposed to him, to confirm, the Truth of his Decisions, to make the Delicacy of his Sentiments perceiv'd, to expose to open Day the Folly he finds in what he condemns. This is what none have done before me. On the contrary, as <hi>Horace</hi> is a true <hi>Proteus,</hi> that takes a thousand different Forms, they have often lost him, and not knowing where to find him, have grapled him as well as they could; they have palm'd upon him in several Places, not only Opinions, which he had not, but even those which he directly refutes: I don't say this to blame those who have taken Pains before me on the Works of this great Poet, I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend their Endeavours, they have open'd me the way; and if it be granted, that I have some little Advantage over them, I ow it wholly to the great Men of Antiquity, whom I have read with more Care, and without doubt with more Leisure. I speak of <hi>Homer,</hi> of <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>Aristotle,</hi> and of some other <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Authors, which I study con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, that I may form my taste on theirs, and draw out of their Writings, the justness of Wit, good Sense and Reason.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:55621:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>I know very well, that there are now adays some Authors, who laugh at these <hi>great Names,</hi> who dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow the Acclamations, which they have receiv'd from all Ages, and who would deprive them of the Crowns, which they have so well deserv'd, and which they have got before such August <hi>Tribunals.</hi> But for fear of falling into <hi>Admiration,</hi> which they look upon as the Child of Ignorance, they do not perceive that they go from that <hi>Admiration,</hi> which <hi>Plato</hi> calls the Mother of <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and which was the first that opened Mens Eyes. I do not wonder that the Celestial Beauties, which we find in the Writing of these incomparable Men, lose with them all their Attractives, and Charms, because they have not the Strength to keep their Eyes long enough upon them. Besides, it is much easier to despise than understand them. As for my self, I declare, that I am full of Admiration, and Veneration for their Divine Geniusses: I have them always before my Eyes, as Venerable and Incorruptible Judges; before whom I take pleasure to fancy, That I ought to give an account of my Writings. At the same Time I have a great Respect for Posterity, and I always think with more <hi>Fear,</hi> than Confidence, on the Judgment that will pass on my Works, if they are happy enough to reach it. All this does not hinder me from esteeming the great Men that live now. I acknowledge that there are a great many who are an Honour to our Age, and who wou'd have adorn'd the Ages pass'd. But amongst these great Men, I speak of, I do not know one, and there cannot be one, who does not esteem, and honour the Ancients, who is not of their taste, and who follows not their Rules. If you go never so little from them, you
<pb facs="tcp:55621:16"/>
go at the same time from Nature and Truth; and I shall not be affraid to affirm, that it wou'd not be more difficult to see without Eyes, or Light, than 'tis impossible to acquire a solid Merit, and to form the Understanding by other means, than by those, that the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> have trac'd for us. Whether it be that we follow them by the only force of Natural Happiness, or Instinct, or that Art, and Study have conducted us thither. As for those who thus blame Antiquity, without knowing of it, once for all I'll undeceive them, and make it appear, that in giving all the advantage to our Age, they take the direct Course to dishonour it; for what greater Proofs can be of the Rudeness, or rather Barbarity of an Age, than in it, to hear <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> called dull, and heavy, <hi>Plato</hi> tiresome, and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>Aristotle</hi> ignorant, <hi>Demosthenes</hi> and <hi>Cicero,</hi> vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Orators, <hi>Virgil</hi> a Poet without either Grace, or Beauty, and <hi>Horace</hi> an Author unpolished, languid, and without force? The <hi>Barbarians</hi> who ravag'd <hi>Greece,</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and who laboured with so much fury to destroy all things that were fine and noble, have never done any thing so horrible as this. But I hope that the false taste of some particular Men with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Authority, will not be imputed to the whole Age, nor give the least Blemish to the Ancients. 'Twas to no purpose that a certain Emperor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd himself an Enemy to <hi>Homer, Virgil</hi> and <hi>Titus Livius.</hi> All his Efforts were ineffectual, and the Oppsition he made to Works so perfect, serv'd on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to augment in his History the number of his Follies, and render him more odious to all Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.</p>

               <l>IF darkest Shades could cloud so bright a Mind,</l>
               <l>Or universal Knowledg be confin'd,</l>
               <l>Then should I fear what vainly you persue,</l>
               <l>Exiling the offending World from you:</l>
               <l>Permit this Phrase, for their's the loss would be,</l>
               <l>To you, 'twere Gain of Ease and Liberty:</l>
               <l>For them alas! what is't I would not fear?</l>
               <l>If banished the rich World of Learning here,</l>
               <l>Within your Breast, where Knowledg is retir'd</l>
               <l>By vain Pursuits and false Explainers tir'd;</l>
               <l>Others bring dazling Light, and leave us more</l>
               <l>Opprest with Blindness than we were before:</l>
               <l>But gently by degrees, like dawning Day,</l>
               <l>The Mists that cloud the Mind you drive away.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:55621:44"/>If you retire, what Damps of black Despair</l>
               <l>Must cloud the World (no longer made your Care?)</l>
               <l>Who could alas deep Mysteries unfold?</l>
               <l>Who could Instruct the Young or Chear the Old?</l>
               <l>Who could like you in lively Colours paint</l>
               <l>Death's gastly Face to each expiring Saint?</l>
               <l>'Tis you and only you can paint him fair,</l>

               <l>Quit not the World, because that Monarch's Brow</l>

               <l>His Anger, like the Wrath of Heaven, is slow,</l>
               <l>And all his Actions his Compassion shew:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:55621:45"/>Unjustice never can his Temper sute,</l>
               <l>Love, gentle Love, is his blest Attribute:</l>
               <l>A Soul enclin'd to such a peaceful Charm,</l>
               <l>No fear of Danger could his Soul alarm:</l>
               <l>Plot upon Plot intended or devis'd,</l>
               <l>He smil'd to see, look'd over and despis'd.</l>
               <l>When every Subject at his Danger shook,</l>
               <l>His Thoughts flow'd easily as a Summers Brook:</l>
               <l>He pardon'd still, and when unruly, they</l>
               <l>Forc'd him the Sword of Justice to display,</l>
               <l>Unwillingly he punish'd, to obey:</l>
               <l>I say, t'obey, for might he still command,</l>
               <l>Garlands of Peace would grow within his Hand;</l>
               <l>Then Love and Wit, in which he does excel,</l>
               <l>With Peace and Plenty, here would ever dwell.</l>
               <l>But now, alas, he rules a giddy Crowd,</l>
               <l>Who slight their Joys and tell their Grief aloud;</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:55621:45"/>As fond of Troubles as he is of Peace,</l>
               <l>So factious Slaves and constant Foes to ease,</l>
               <l>Still forcing Fears unnatural and base;</l>
               <l>At home distracted, and abroad despis'd,</l>
               <l>The Grief of Fools, and laughter of the Wise.</l>
               <l>But hold! too far, I have mistook my way,</l>
               <l>I would return, and yet what can I say?</l>
               <l>The Subject is so vast to which I'm brought,</l>
               <l>That I am lost in the Abyss of Thought;</l>
               <l>I would persuade, and yet I know not how</l>
               <l>To make that Theam to my weak Numbers bow,</l>
               <l>Exalt my humble Notions to your height,</l>
               <l>I'll plainly tell my Thoughts, raise you their Flight.</l>
               <l>Leave not the World, but near that Monarch rest,</l>
               <l>Who all that's just still harbours in his Breast,</l>
               <l>And when that Head so fill'd with boundless Thought</l>
               <l>To his enlarged Heart is nearer brought,</l>

               </l>
               <l>Till darken'd Mankind had forgot the Light.</l>
               <l>But thou art false, and therefore shouldst be scorn'd,</l>
               <l>And not with fruitless Tears and Sorrows mourn'd:</l>
               <l>But now my Scorn, alas! would please thee more</l>

               <l>Then with her Fan, perhaps, you play,</l>
               <l>When you should cool her t'other way.</l>
               <l>These are the Reasons, as I ghess,</l>
               <l>That makes you have such ill Success;</l>
               <l>But if by chance you have the Fortune</l>
               <l>To win the Lady you importune,</l>
               <l>'Tis one you pick up at <hi>Hypolito</hi>'s,</l>
               <l>Whom for a Month or two you follow close,</l>
               <l>And though enjoy'd by half the Town,</l>
               <l>Keeps you at Distance with a Frown,</l>
               <l>Till by <hi>persuasive Presents</hi> gain'd,</l>
               <l>The <hi>mighty Victory</hi>'s obtain'd;</l>
               <l>And when you think your self most happy,</l>
               <l>'Tis ten to one, the Jade will Clap you.</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:55621:57"/>Successively my Pleasures move,</l>
               <l>From Love to Wine, from Wine to Love:</l>
               <l>Kindly each other they relieve,</l>
               <l>And Change does double Pleasure give:</l>
               <l>Then against Wine be not inveterate,</l>
               <l>Because the other you are better at;</l>
               <l>But use them both, and the Delight</l>
               <l>Will prove your Friend is in the Right.</l>
