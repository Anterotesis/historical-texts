            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Loves Empire; Or, The GALLANTRIES Of the FRENCH COURT.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Otwithſtanding that in the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth the War had continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed above Twenty years, yet it did not hinder Love from cauſing ſome Amourous In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues; but as the Court was only filled
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61590:6"/>
with old inſenſible Gentlemen, and young Sparks bred up in Armies, and whom that Profeſſion had rendred Brutal, moſt of the Ladies were become leſs modeſt than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly; and ſeeing they ſhould have lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in Idleneſs if they had not made Advances, or at leaſt if they had been Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, a great many grew tender hearted, and ſome very Confident.</p>
            <p>Of this laſt Tribe was Madam <hi>d' Olonne:</hi> She had a round Face, a pretty Noſe, a little Mouth, fine ſparkling Eyes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate Features, yet ſmiling, which embe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhes moſt people, had in her a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary effect; her Hair was a bright brown, her Complexion admirable, her Neck, Hands and Arms were well made, her ſhape was not to be commended, nor would ſhe have been thought Charming had it not been for her Face: This much her Flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſay, That when ſhe firſt appeared at Court ſhe had a handſome Body; which is the uſual plea of thoſe who would excuſe Women who are too Corpulent. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this Lady was too ſincere in this caſe to leave people in an Errour, for every one that had a mind might be informed of the contrary, and it was not her fault ſhe did not undeceive all the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61590:6"/>
Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> had a quick and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant Wit when ſhe was free; yet ſhe was ſomething falſe, inconſtant, bold, malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, loved pleaſures even to Debauch; and there was exceſs in her leaſt Divertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: Her Beauty rather than her Eſtate, which was but ſmall, obliged the Count <hi>d' Olonne</hi> to endeavour the making her his Wife: Which he quickly effected, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Perſon of Quality, and having a great Eſtate, he was agreeably received by Madam <hi>de la Louppe</hi> her Mother, and had not the leiſure to ſigh for Charms which for two years had inflamed the deſires of all the Court: This Match being conſummated, thoſe Lovers withdrew who pretended to Marriage, and others came who only aimed at being beloved. One of the firſt who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf was <hi>Beuvron,</hi> whom the Neighbourhood of Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> gave the more conveniency of ſeeing; and by this means loved her a pretty while without being diſcovered; and I fancy this Amour would have ſtill been concealed, if <hi>Beuvron</hi> had never had Rivals: But the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> being fallen in love with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> quickly perceived what had thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto remained concealed for want of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſed People: Not but that <hi>d' Olonne</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:61590:7"/>
loved his Wife extreamly, but Husbands are ſtupid, and ſo are never Lovers, and the jealouſie of theſe is much more piercing than that of the others: So that the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> ſaw things that <hi>d' Olonne</hi> did not, and never has ſeen, for he is ſtill ignorant that <hi>Beuvron</hi> has had an Intrigue with his Wife.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beuvron</hi> had black Eys, a handſom Noſe, a little Mouth, a long Face, very black long and thick Hair, a fine Shape, and Wit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; He was not one of thoſe who talk all in Company, but was a Man of good ſenſe and honour, tho he had naturally an averſion for War, ſo that being fallen in love with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> he ſought for an opportunity to diſcover to her his Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Their Neighbourhood at <hi>Paris</hi> gave him occaſions enough, but her Inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy made him apprehend an Intrigue with her: At length happening one day to meet with her without other Company, <hi>If I on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſigned, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>to let you know that I love you, words would be alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unneceſſary, my cares and my looks have told you ſufficiently what effect your Charms have had upon me; But, Madam, as I expect you ſhould one day make returns to my flames, it is requiſite that I diſcover 'em, and aſſure you</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:61590:7"/>
               <hi>at the ſame time, that whether you love me or not, I am reſolved to be your Votary as long as I live.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Beuvron</hi> having ceaſed ſpeaking, <hi>Sir,</hi> anſwered Madam <hi>d' Olonne, This is not the firſt time I perceived you loved me, and tho you did not acquaint me with it, I did not fail to think my ſelf obliged to you for all you have done for me ſince the firſt moment you ſaw me, and this ought to be my Excuſe when I confeſs I love you: Therefore do not eſteem me the leſs, having long underſtood your ſighs, and tho I ſhould be ſomething blamed for my little reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, it would be a mark of the force of your merit rather than of my eaſineſs.</hi> It is eaſie to imagine that after this Confeſſion it was not long before the Lady delivered up her Fort to her Gallant: This Intrigue laſted four or five Months without diſturbance to either Party, but at length the Beauty of Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> was too much talked of, and that Conqueſt promiſed too much Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in appearance to him who ſhould make it, for <hi>Beuvron</hi> to be at reſt. The Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> who was the handſomeſt man of the Court, fancied that nothing was want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his Reputation, but the being belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the moſt beautiful Woman of the Kingdom: Wherefore he took a Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61590:8"/>
at the Army, three Months after the Campaigne, to be in love with her aſſoon he ſhould ſee her; and made appear by a great Paſſion he had afterwards for her, that Love is not always the work of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and of Fortune.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> had blew Eyes, a handſome Noſe, irregular Features, a great and diſagreeable Mouth, but very fine Teeth, light yellowiſh Hair both long and thick, his Shape was admirable, and he dreſſed ſo well, that the greateſt Sparks endeavoured to imitate him; he had the air of a Perſon of great Quality, he held one of the firſt Ranks in <hi>France,</hi> was Duke and Peer, Governour of <hi>Burgundy</hi> joyntly with his Father, and ſole Governour of <hi>Auvergne,</hi> and Colonel General of the French Infantry: His <hi>Genius</hi> was mean, but in his firſt Amours falling into the hands of a Lady who had an infinite deal of Wit, and as they had loved one another extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhe had taken ſo much care to poliſh him, and he to pleaſe that fair One, that Art had ſurpaſſed Nature, and he was a much better bred man than a thouſand o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers who have more ſenſe than he.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:61590:8"/>
Inſomuch that being returned from <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talonia,</hi> where he had commanded the Army under the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> he begun by a thouſand eagerneſſes to acquaint Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> with the love he had for her, thinking ſhe had never had an Amourous Intrigue: But ſeeing ſhe made no returns to his Paſſion, he reſolved to acquaint her with it after ſuch a manner as that ſhe might not ſeem to be ignorant of it; but as he had a kind of baſhful reſpect for all Women, he choſe rather to write than ſpeak to Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> and his Letter was in theſe terms.</p>

            <p>This Letter which grateful People would have thought very kind, did not ſeem ſo to the Duke of <hi>Candale;</hi> As he was very vain, he had expected leſs intricate Favours: and this obliged him not to preſs Madam <hi>d' O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne</hi> ſo much as ſhe was willing he ſhould have done, and made her a hard task in ſpight of her ſelf; and the thing had laſted a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61590:9"/>
long time, if the Fair One had not gained upon her Modeſty to make him ſo many advances, that he fancyed he might make an attack without being expoſed to a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe. The buſineſs being done, he quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceived <hi>Beuvron</hi>'s Commerce. Uſually a Pretender looks only before him, but a Lover well treated, looks on the right and on the left, and is not long without diſcovering his Rival: Hereupon the Duke complaines; His Miſtreſs calls him Caprichious and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and takes him up ſo roundly, that he aſks her pardon for his ſuſpicions, and fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies himſelf too happy in having appeaſed her. This Calm did not long continue, <hi>Beu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vron</hi> for his part reproached her to as little purpoſe as the Duke did, and ſeeing he could not deſtroy his Rival himſelf, he cauſed notice to be given under hand to <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne</hi> that his Wife entertained the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> for her Galant. <hi>D' Olonne</hi> forbids her to ſee him, that is to ſay, redoubled the Paſſion of thoſe two Lovers, who having the more deſire to ſee one another ſince it was forbidden, found a thouſand more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient oppurtunities than thoſe they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; However <hi>Beuvron</hi> remaining Maſter of the field of Battails, the Duke of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> renewed, his Complaints againſt him,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61590:10"/>
and uſed all his endeavours to have him Caſhiered, but all to no purpoſe; Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> told him that ſhe perceived he only conſidered his own Intereſt, and that he cared not if he ruined her, ſince that if ſhe ſhould forbid <hi>Beuvron</hi> to ſee her, her husband and all the world would not doubt but that ſhe made that ſacrifice to him; Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> did not love <hi>Beuvron</hi> ſo much as ſhe did the Duke, yet ſhe was not willing however to loſe him, and as well becauſe One and One make Two, as that becauſe Cocquetts fancy they can retaine their Galants better by a little Jealouſy than a great Tranquility.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Paget</hi> a man pretty well ſtricken in years, meanly born, but very rich, fell in love with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> and having diſcovered that ſhe loved the ſport, he fancyed that his Money would ſerve him inſtead of Merit; and founded his greateſt hopes upon the ſum he reſolved to offer her; He had acceſs enough to her houſe to have ſpoke to her himſelf, if he had durſt; but he had not the bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to begin a diſcourſe, which might be of ill conſequence if it was not kindly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, ſo that he thought the beſt courſe would be to write to her, which he did in theſe termes.</p>

               <hi>Paget</hi> did not fail to be at the Aſſignation, and went thither in a Habit, that is to ſay, with his Bag and the appurtenances. <hi>Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> having introduced him into her Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriſſes

Cloſet, left them together: <hi>See here, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, ſhewing what he brought, <hi>this is what is not daily met with: will you receive it? I am willing,</hi> ſaid Madam <hi>d' Olonne, and it will help to amuſe us.</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon having counted the two Thouſand broad Pieces they had agreed for, ſhe ſhut them up in a little Trunk, and placing her ſelf by them upon a little Couch, which did not laſt her long, <hi>Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>there is not a Man in</hi> France <hi>wrights like you; what I am going to ſay, is not to ſhew my ſelf a Critick, but it is certain that I find but few people that have ſo much Wit as you have. Moſt men enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain us only with Fopperies, and when they would write to us kind Letters, they think they have done Miracles in telling us that they adore us, that they ſhall dye if we do not Love them, and that if we will be ſo gracious to them, they will ſerve us as long as they live: we have much need in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed of their Services. I am overioyed,</hi> ſaid <hi>Paget, that my Letters pleaſe you; I ſhould not ſay this elſewhere, but to you, Madam, I ſhall not mince the matter, my Letters coſt me nothing. This is hard to be beleived,</hi> anſwered <hi>ſhe, you muſt then have a very great Stock.</hi> After ſome other Diſcourſes, which Love interrupted two or thre times, they agreed of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Interview, and at that of another: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61590:11"/>
that thoſe two thouſand Broad Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces procured <hi>Paget</hi> three Aſſignations.</p>
            <p>But Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> being willing to make advantage of the Love of this Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen, and of his Riches, deſired him at the fourth Viſit to begin again to write to her ſuch Letters of Gallantry as that ſhe had received from him: But he ſeeing that this would come to be of Conſequence, he fell to reproaching her, which did him no good; and all that he could obtain was, that he ſhould not be drove from her Houſe, and that he might come and play when ſhe ſhould ſend for him.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> fancied that by letting <hi>Paget</hi> ſee her, ſhe ſhould inflame his deſires, and that perhaps he would be again ſo ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as to ſatisfie them at any rate; but tho he was ſo much in love as not to be able to forbear ſeeing her, yet he was not charmed to the degree of buying her Favours dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>Things being in theſe terms, whether ſpight made <hi>Paget</hi> blab, or that his frequent Viſits and the Money that Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> had played away, cauſed the Duke of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> to make reflexions, he deſired his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, when he departed for <hi>Catalonia,</hi> not to ſee <hi>Paget</hi> any more, whoſe Commerce

was injurious to her Reputation; which ſhe promiſed him, but did not keep her word; Inſomuch that the Duke being informed by thoſe who ſent him News from <hi>Paris,</hi> that <hi>Paget</hi> went oftner then ever to Madam <hi>d'Olonnes</hi> Houſe, he wrote to her this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> was ſo fully aſſured by this Letter, that he reſolved not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn his Miſtris any more upon appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which he judged to be all deceitful. And for having been, as he thought, without reaſon ſuſpicious, he fell into the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of Confidence, and took in good part all the Cocquetry and Infidelity that Madam <hi>d'Olonne</hi> committed for ſix Months together; for ſhe continued to ſee <hi>Paget,</hi> and to give Favours to <hi>Beuvron;</hi> and tho the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> had notice given him of it from ſeveral parts, he fancied that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from his Father or his Frinds, who were deſirous to divert him from loving Madam <hi>d'Olonne,</hi> believing that this Paſſion would hinder him from thinking of Marry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:61590:13"/>
So that he returned from the Army more in love than he had ever been; Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> likewiſe, with whom ſo long an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence made the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> paſse for a new Galant, redoubled her eagerneſs for him, even in the ſight of all the Court; this Lover took the Imprudences ſhe committed to ſee him, for marks of a paſſion ſhe was no longer Miſtriſs of, tho they were only Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the natural Irregularity of her reaſon; when ſhe did any Paſſionate act that made a Noiſe, he thought her deeply in love and yet ſhe was only ſilly. And he was ſo perſwaded of the kindneſs ſhe had for him, that tho he ſhould dye for her ſake, he apprehended he ſhould be ſtill ungrateful.</p>
            <p>It is eaſy to imagine that the Carriage of theſe Lovers made a great Noiſe; they had both of them Enemies; but the Fortune of the One and the Beauty of the Other made-a great many envy them: tho all the world would have ſerved them, they would have deſtroyed all by their Imprudence, and all the world would have done them hurt: They made Aſſignations every where, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having taken any meaſures with any Body. They ſaw One another often in a houſe, that the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> kept in
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61590:13"/>
the name of a Country Lady whom Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> pretended to viſit moſt commonly by night at her own Houſe: all theſe Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>devouzes did not take up all the time of this perfidious One, for when the Duke left her ſhe went to the conqueſt of ſome new Lover, or at leaſt to reaſſume <hi>Beuvron</hi> by a thouſand kindneſſes for the fears the Duke gave him.</p>
            <p>The Winter paſſed thus without the Duke of <hi>Candales</hi> ſuſpecting the leaſt ill in all ſhe did, and he left her to return to the Army as well ſatisfied as he had ever been: he had not been there two Months but that he learnt news which troubled his joy: His par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular friends who took ſtrict notice of his Miſtreſſes Conduct did not dare to ſay any thing to him as long as they found him pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſed by that faithleſs One; but ſomething very extraordinary having hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened ſince his abſence, and not fearing a ſight of her ſhould deſtroy the impreſſions they would give him, they altogether hazarded, without making appear any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign or concert, to acquaint him with her behaviour. Whereupon they each of them ſingly ſent him word that <hi>Ieannin</hi> was deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> that his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61590:14"/>
aſſiduities gave cauſe to believe, not only a deſign, but a happy ſucceſs; and in a word, that tho ſhe were not culpable, he ought not to be ſatisfied with her, ſeeing ſhe was ſuſpected by all People.</p>
            <p>But while theſe News are going to put the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> in a rage, it is fit I ſhould ſpeak of the birth, progreſs, and ends <hi>Jeannin</hi>'s Paſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeannin de Caſtille</hi> was well ſhaped, had a pleaſing Countenance, was very ſpruce, but had little Wit; his Quality and Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion were the ſame that <hi>Pagets,</hi> and was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rich as well as he. He was handſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to have it believed that in caſe he had worn a Sword, his Merit alone might have procured him the Ladies Favours, but his Profeſſion and his Riches made it ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, that all the Women he had had In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues with, were intereſſed, inſomuch that when he was ſeen to be in love with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> it was not doubted but that he would be beloved for his Money.</p>
            <p>The King after having paſſed the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers upon the Frontiers, uſually returned to <hi>Paris</hi> in the Winters, and all the Diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements of the World poſſeſſed his Mind by turns; Billiards, Tennis, Hunting, Plays, and Dancing had each their times
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61590:14"/>
with him: At that time Lotteries were ſo much the mode, that every one had them; ſome of Money, others of Jewels and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veables. Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> reſolved to have One of Money; but whereas in the moſt part of them all the Caſh was employed they had received, and that Fortune ſhared it, in this, which was of Ten thouſand Crowns, there was not Five employed, and thoſe Five too were diſtributed according as Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> thought fit. <hi>Jeannin</hi> was preſent when ſhe made the firſt Propoſals of the Lottery, and as ſhe asked a Sum of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one according to their Abilities, and that ſhe told him he was to give an Hundred pound, he made Anſwer, That he was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, and moreover promiſed her to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure amongſt his Friends wherewith to make it up a Thouſand. Preſently after, all the Company being gone except <hi>Jean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin, I know not, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>whether you are yet acquainted with my Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for I have loved you a long time, and my ſighs already mount to a very great ſum; but after having given my ſelf entirely to you, I muſt needs ask the confirmation of my Bail, which I beſeech you to ſign, Madam; and obſerve, that beſides the Hundred pound you taxed me, I give you Nine hundred more for</hi>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:61590:15"/>
               <hi>the having your Affection; for what I ſaid of my Friends was only to deceive the People that were here when I ſpoke to you of this Affair. I confeſs, Sir,</hi> anſwered Madam <hi>d' Olonne, I never thought you in love till now, not but that I have obſerved by certain Meenes in you, what made me ſuſpect ſome things, but I am ſo diſguſted with thoſe kind of ways, and ſighs and languiſhings are in my mind ſo poor a Galantry, and ſuch feeble Teſtimonies of love, that if you had not taken a more gentile Courſe with me, you had lost your pains all your life time.</hi> Now as for Acknowledgment, you may believe that People are not far from loving, when we are well aſſured of being beloved: There need no more to make <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annin</hi> believe that he was at the Critical Minute. He caſt himſelf at Madam <hi>d' O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne</hi>'s feet, and as he would have made uſe of that Action of Humility for a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text to higher Enterprizes, <hi>No,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>you are miſtaken, Sir; In what Country have you heard ſay that Women make Advances? When you ſhall have given me reall marks of a great Paſſion, I ſhall not be ungrateful. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annin,</hi> ſeeing that with her, Money was to be delivered before the Commodity, told her, That he had two Hundred broad Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and that he would give them her if ſhe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:61590:15"/>
pleaſed: She conſented, and having recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them; <hi>If you think fit, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>to grant me ſome favour upon the account of this Money, you will extreamly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me; or if you will ſtay till you have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the whole Sum, give me a Note under your Hand of the value received.</hi> She choſe rather to kiſs than write; and a Moment after <hi>Jeannin</hi> went away, aſſuring her that he would bring the reſt on the morrow, which he did not fail to do; and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was no ſooner counted, then that ſhe kept her word with him with all the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour that can be expected in ſuch a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Tho <hi>Jeannin</hi> came in through the ſame Door that <hi>Paget</hi> did, ſhe uſed him much better; whether ſhe hoped to draw greater Advantages from him at length, or that he had ſome concealed Merit that ſerved him inſtead of Liberality; ſhe did not ask him new Proofs of Love for the giving him new Favours. The Thouſand pounds made her love him three Months together, that is to ſay, treated him as if ſhe had loved him.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> having received Advice of his Miſtreſſes new Intrigues, he wrote her this Letter.</p>

            <p>The Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> wrote this Letter juſt as he was upon returning to Court; he had newly loſt a Battail, which did not a little contribute to the bitterneſs of his Letter: He could not ſuffer being beaten every where, and it would have been ſome Comfort to him in the Misfortunes of the War, if he had been more happy in Love. So that he began his Journey under a terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

Melancholy: At another time he would have come Poſt, but as if he had had ſome fore-knowledge of his ill Fortune, he came as ſlowly as poſſible; he began to find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſomething Indiſpoſed upon the way.

            <p>The firſt Letter that the Duke of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale</hi> wrote to Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> about <hi>Jean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nin,</hi> had made her ſo much affraid of his Return, that ſhe dreaded it like Death, and I fancy ſhe wiſhed ſhe might never ſee him more. And yet the rumour of his being in that Extremity grieved her to the heart, and the News of his Death, which her Friend the Counteſs of <hi>Fieſque</hi> brought her, had like to have made her dye her ſelf. She loſt her Senſes for ſome moments, and came only to herſelf at the Name of <hi>Merillus,</hi> whom ſhe was told asked to ſpeak with her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Merille</hi> was the Duke's principal Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and brought Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> the Letter from his Maſter that he had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to her as he lay a dying, and the little Trunk wherein he put his Letters, and all the other Favours he had received from her. After having read this laſt Letter, ſhe fell
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:61590:17"/>
a Crying more bitterly than before. The Counteſs not being willing to leave her in ſo deplorable Condition, propoſed the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening that Trunck for the amuſing her grief. The Counteſs found at firſt a Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief ſtained with blood in ſeveral pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. <hi>Ah! my God,</hi> cryed Madam <hi>d' Olonne, how has that poor Man, who had ſo many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things of greater Conſequence, kept this Handkerchief till now; is there any thing in the world ſo kind!</hi> And thereupon ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to the Counteſs, that having cut her Finger as ſhe was working by him ſome years ago, he had asked that Handkerchief of hen, with which ſhe had wiped her hand, and had kept it ever ſince. After that they found Bracelets, Purſes, Hair and Pictures of Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> and coming to the Letters, the Counteſs deſired her Friend that ſhe might read ſome of them. Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> having given her Conſent, the Counteſs opened this firſt.</p>

            <p>While the Counteſs was reading this Letter with motions of Concern and Pity, Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> was melting into tears; after having peruſed it, they were both ſome time without ſpeaking: <hi>I'le read no more now,</hi> ſaid the Counteſs, <hi>for ſince it puts me in pain, it muſt needs trouble you much more.

               <hi>Is it true,</hi> Merille, ſaid the Counteſs, <hi>that the Duke of</hi> Candale <hi>was in love with Madam</hi>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:61590:19"/>
de Caſtillanne? <hi>No, No, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>he was two days in</hi> Avignon <hi>at his return from the Army, to refreſh himſelf, and there he made two Viſits to Madam</hi> de Caſtel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanne; <hi>judge if this can be called Love.

Alas!</hi> anſwered ſhe, <hi>I only know the publick report; but it is ſo common, that this Amour is even ſaid to be partly Cauſe of his Death:</hi> And then ſhe fell a crying again more than ever. The Counteſs, who only ſought to make a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to her Grief, asked her if ſhe knew not the Hand of a Superſcription of a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe ſhewed her: <hi>Yes,</hi> anſwered Madam <hi>d' Olonne, it is a Letter from my Steward. This must be ſomething very Curious,</hi> ſaid the Counteſs, <hi>I muſt ſee what he writes;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon opened this Letter.</p>

                     <hi>LEt my Lady tell you what ſhe will, her Houſe is never empty of Normans; thoſe Devils would be much better in their Countrey than here; I am mad, my Lord, to ſee what I ſee, which I do not ſend you the Particulars of, becauſe I hope you will be here very ſuddenly, where you will take order for all your ſelf.</hi>

               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:61590:19"/>
By theſe, Normans the Steward meant <hi>Beuvron</hi> and his Brothers, <hi>Jarry</hi> and the Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier <hi>de Sainct Earemond,</hi> and the Abbot <hi>de Villerceaux,</hi> who were very aſſiduous at Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s Houſe. The plainneſs with which this poor Man ſent this News to the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> did ſo move that foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Woman, that after having looked upon the Counteſs to ſee how ſhe took it, ſhe burſt out a laughing; the Counteſs not having ſo much reaſon to be afflicted as ſhe had, did the like: But poor <hi>Merille</hi> not being able to bear with ſo unreaſonable a Joy, redoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his Fears, and went out of the Cabinet in a pet. Two or three days after Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> being perfectly comforted, the Counteſs and her other Friends ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed her to mourn for her Honours ſake, her Intrigue with the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been too publick, to make a Myſtery of it: So that ſhe conſtrained her ſelf four or five days, after which ſhe followed her old Courſe, and that which haſtened her laying by her Mask of Mourning was the Carneval, which by giving her an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſatisfie her Inclination, helped her likewiſe to content her Husband, who had great ſuſpicions of her Correſpondence with the Duke of <hi>Candale,</hi> and thought
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:61590:20"/>
himſelf very happy in being freed from him. Wherefore to make him believe ſhe was no longer concerned, ſhe masked herſelf four or five times with him, and being willing to regain entirely his Confidence by a great ſincerity, ſhe not only confeſſed to him her love for the Duke, not only that ſhe had ſuffered the Fort to be taken, but the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of their Enjoyments: And as ſhe ſpecified the number, <hi>He had but little love for you, Madam,</hi> ſaid he, inſulting the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the poor deceaſed, <hi>ſince he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo ſeldom with ſo beautiful a Woman as you are.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>She had left her Bed but a week, which ſhe had kept above four, by reaſon of a great hurt ſhe had in her leg, when ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to mask herſelf. And this deſire advanced her Cure more then all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies ſhe had uſed of a long time: So that ſhe went in Maſquerade four of five times with her Husband; but as theſe were only little private Maſquerades, ſhe reſolved to have a great and famous One that might be talked of; and to that intent ſhe, and three more, diſguiſed themſelves like Capuchins, and cauſed two others of her Friends to be diguiſed like Nuns: The Capuchins were ſhe herſelf, her Husband, <hi>Jarry,</hi> and the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:61590:20"/>
Abbot <hi>de Villerſeaux:</hi> The Nuns were my Lord <hi>Crofts</hi> an Engliſhman, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſs <hi>de Sillery.</hi> This Troop run into all Companies on <hi>Shrove-Tueſday</hi> Night. The King and Queen his Mother having been informed of this Maſquerade, were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly diſpleaſed with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> and ſaid openly that they would revenge the Injury and Contempt that had been had of Religion in that Occaſion. Some time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Majeſties were pacified, and all theſe Threatnings ended in their having no more eſteem for Madam <hi>d' Olonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During all theſe paſſages, <hi>Jeannin</hi> pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceably enjoyed his Miſtreſs. When ſhe cauſed the Lottery to be drawn, I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid that of Ten thouſand Crowns ſhe had received, ſhe had employed but the half at moſt, and the greateſt part of this half was diſtributed to the Capuchins, to the Nuns, and others of the Cabal. The Prince of <hi>Marſillac,</hi> who was young, to act the chiefeſt part upon this Stage, had the greateſt Lot, which was a Silver Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern. <hi>Jeannin,</hi> with all the Favours he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; had only a Jewel of very ſmall va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue: The great Rumour that run of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit of this Lottery, vexed him to ſee that he was no better treated than the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:61590:21"/>
He complained to Madam <hi>d' O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne,</hi> ſhe not thinking fit to acquaint him with her Roguery, received his Complaints very ill, inſomuch that before they parted, they both fell to Reproaches, the one for his Money, the other for her Favours. The Concluſion of which was, Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s forbidding him her Houſe, and <hi>Jeannin</hi> told her that he had never obeyed her ſo wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly as he ſhould do in that Occaſion, and that this Command would ſave him both Trouble and Expence.</p>
            <p>In the mean time <hi>Beuvron</hi>'s Commerce with her, laſted ſtill; whether the Spark was not much in love, or that he thought himſelf happy in having her Favours at any rate, he tormented her a little about her Behaviour, ſhe alſo treated as one ſhe made uſe of when others failed her, and her love for him was as little as nothing.</p>
            <p>Shortly after her falling out with <hi>Jeannin, Marſillac</hi> who had Friends who were much brisker than he was himſelf, was adviſed by them to apply himſelf to Madam <hi>d' O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne,</hi> and told him that he was of an Age to make himſelf talked of, that Women procured Eſteem as well as War, that Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> being one of the greateſt Beauties of the Court, beſides the great
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:61590:21"/>
Pleaſures, would likewiſe be an Honour to him ſhe ſhould love; and that it was very glorious to fill the place of the Duke of <hi>Candale.</hi> With all theſe Reaſons they eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on <hi>Marillac</hi> to make his Viſits to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>d' Olonne;</hi> but becauſe he was natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally very diſtruſtful of himſelf, his Cabal being alſo very diſtruſtful of him, judged it was not fit he ſhould be left upon his word with her; and it was concluded that <hi>Sillery</hi> ſhould be appointed for his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and to aſſiſt him upon occaſion. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillac</hi> had made great Application to her for two Months for this, without having ſpoke to her of Love, otherwiſe then in general terms: He had however told <hi>Sille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> that it was above ſix Weeks ſince he had made an Amarous Declaration to her, and had likewiſe invented a very harſh An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that he ſaid ſhe made him, that he might not think it ſtrange he was ſo long without receiving Favours. Whereupon this Governour, to ſerve his Pupil, ſpoke thus to Madam <hi>d' Olonne: I know very well, Madam, that nothing is ſo free as Love, and that if the heart is not touched by inclination, the mind will never be much perſwaded by words; but I must however tell you, that when a Perſon is young and unmarried, I do not</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:61590:22"/>
               <hi>comprehend why a young amorous Gentleman is refuſed, who is as well provided, or I am much mistaken, as any man about Court; it is poor</hi> Marſillac <hi>I ſpeak of, Madam, ſince he is deſperately in love with you, why are you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful? Or if you find you cannot love him, why do you amuſe him? Love him or diſmiſs him. I know not ſince when,</hi> anſwered Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>d' Olonne, that Men pretend we ſhould love them, without their having made it their Requeſt; for I have heard ſay, it was they who formerly made Court. I know very well that in theſe latter days they treat Gallantry after a strange manner; but I knew not that they had reduced it to the point of requiring that Women ſhould be their Votaries. How,</hi> anſwered <hi>Sillery, has not</hi> Marſillac <hi>declared he loved you? No, Sir,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>it is you who firſt tell it me. Not but that his Aſſidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties have made me ſuſpect he had ſome deſign; but till we are ſpoke to, we do not underſtand the reſt. Ah Madam,</hi> replied <hi>Sillery, you are not then ſo much in fault as I thought,</hi> Maril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac<hi>'s Youth renders him fearful; but the ſame Youth makes Women excuſe ſeveral things: Perſons of his Age are ſeldome faulty, and men but Twenty years old always meet with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. I grant,</hi> replied Madam <hi>d' Olonne, that the Baſhfulneſs of a young Man raiſes</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:61590:22"/>
               <hi>Pity, and never Anger; but I likewiſe pretend he ſhould be reſpectful. Do you call reſpect, Madam,</hi> ſaid <hi>Sillery</hi> to her, <hi>the not daring to ſay we are in love? It is all meer folly, I ſay, in regard of a Woman who would not make Returns: For in that Caſe the Gallant would not loſe his time; and would quickly know what he was to truſt to: But this reſpect which you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, Madam, is only of advantage to you with thoſe you have no inclination for; for if the Man you are inclined to love ſhould have too much of it, you would be very much perplexed.</hi> As he had done ſpeaking, Company came in, whereupon he took his leave, and went to ſeek out <hi>Marſillac,</hi> to whom having made a thouſand Reproaches for his Timidity, he made him promiſe that before that day was at an end, he would make an amorous Declaration to his Miſtreſs: He likewiſe told him part of the things it was requiſite he ſhould ſay, which <hi>Marſillac</hi> had forgot within a Moment after; and having encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged him as much as he could, he ſaw him ſet out for this great Expedition.</p>
            <p>However <hi>Marſillac</hi> was under ſtrange diſquiets, ſometimes he thought his Coach went too faſt, ſometimes he wiſhed he might not find Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> at home, or that he might find ſome body with her:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:61590:23"/>
In a word, he feared the ſame things that a brisk Man would have deſired with all his heart. However, he was ſo unhappy as to meet with his Miſtreſs, and to find her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. He came up to her with ſo diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Countenance, that if <hi>Sillery</hi> had not already acquainted her with his Love, ſhe would have diſcovered it by ſeeing him only that time. This Diſorder helped to perſwade her more then all he, or the Eloquence of his Friend could have ſaid to her: And it is for this reaſon that Fools are more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py than the Wiſe in Love.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing that <hi>Marſillac</hi> did after being ſeated, was putting on his Hat, ſo little was he himſelf; an inſtant after per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his folly, he took off his Hat and Gloves, then put on one again, and all this without ſaying a Word. <hi>What's the matter, Sir,</hi> ſaid Madam <hi>d' Olonne, you ſeem to be concerned at ſomething. Do not you Divine it, Madam,</hi> ſaid <hi>Marſillac? No,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>I do not comprehend it; How ſhould I underſtand what you do not tell me, being hardly able to conceive what I am told? I ſhall tell you then, what it is,</hi> replied <hi>Marſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lac</hi> ſimpering, <hi>I am in love with you. But why ſo much Ceremony,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>for ſo ſmall a thing: I do not ſee there is ſo much difficulty in</hi>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:61590:23"/>
               <hi>loving, there appearing much more in loving well. Ah Madam! I find it much harder to tell it than to do it; I find none at all in loving you, and I ſhould find it ſo difficult to ceaſe loving you, that I ſhould never be able to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, tho you ſhould order it me a thouſand times. I Sir,</hi> replied Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> bluſhing, <hi>I have nothing to Command you.</hi> Any other than <hi>Marſillac</hi> would have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the cunning way that Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> made uſe of to permit him to love her: But his Wit was gone a Wool-gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all Delicacy upon him was loſt. <hi>How Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>do you not eſteem me enough to honour me with your Commands. Well,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>ſhould you be glad I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered you not to love me any longer? No, Madam,</hi> replied he bluntly. <hi>What would you be at then,</hi> ſaid Madam <hi>d' Olonne? Love you as long as I live,</hi> ſaid he. <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>love me as long as you pleaſe and hope.</hi> This had been ſufficient for a more preſſing Gallant than <hi>Marſillac</hi> to have pretended to enjoyment immediately; and yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all that Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> could do, he made her wait two Months, and at length, when they came to the point, ſhe was forced to make all the Advances. The eſtabliſhing: this new Commerce did not
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:61590:24"/>
make her break that ſhe had with <hi>Beuvron:</hi> The laſt Lover was ever the moſt beloved, but he was not ſo much in her Favour as to drive away <hi>Beuvron,</hi> who was a ſecond Husband to her.</p>
            <p>A little before the Repture of <hi>Jeannin</hi> with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> the Chevalier of <hi>Grammont</hi> was fallen in love with her, and he being a very extraordinary Perſon, it is fit I give a Deſcription of him.</p>
            <p>The Chevalier had brisk Eyes, a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Noſe, a pretty Mouth, a dimple in his Chin, and I know not what of ſine in his Phiſiognomy, his Shape had been comely, had he not ſtooped, his Wit was delicate and gallant. However, his Meen and his Accent gave a Grace to what he ſaid, that became nothing in the Mouth of another. A mark of this is that he writ the worſt of any Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and he writ as he ſpoke. Though it be ſuperfluous to ſay that a Rival is incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mode, the Chevalier was to that point, that it would have been better for a poor Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to be troubled with four others then he alone. He was ſo ſprightly that he hardly ever ſlept, he was liberal to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, and by that means his Miſtreſs and his Rivals could not have Servants nor Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets but what he knew, otherwiſe the
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:61590:24"/>
beſt Man in the World. It was twelve years ſince he began to love the Counteſs of <hi>Fieſque,</hi> a Woman as extraordinary as he was a Man, that is to ſay, as ſingular in Merits as he was in ill Qualities; but as of thoſe twelve years ſhe had been baniſhed, five from Mademoiſelle <hi>d' Orleans, Gaſton</hi>'s of <hi>France</hi>'s Daughter, a Princeſs whom Fortune perſecuted, becauſe ſhe had Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and could not reduce her great Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to the baſeneſſes that the Court de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. During their abſence the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier had tied himſelf to a very regular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy; and tho the Counteſs was very lovely, he merited ſome excuſe for his Lightneſs, being he had never received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny favour from her. He had however cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſeveral to be jealous; <hi>Rouville</hi> was one of thoſe who were ſo: As he was one day reproaching the Counteſs that ſhe loved the Chevalier, that fair One told him that he was mad to believe ſhe could love the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Cheat in the World. <hi>This is a pleaſant reaſon, Madam, which you alledge, I know you are a greater Cheat than he, and yet I cannot forbear loving you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tho the Chevalier was in love with all Women, the Counteſs however had that power over him, that what engagement
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:61590:25"/>
ſoever he had elſewhere, ſo ſoon as he knew that any One viſited her oftner that ordinary, he quitted all to return to her: And he was in the Right, for the Counteſs was a lovely Woman, ſhe had blew and ſparkling Eyes, a handſome Noſe, an agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Mouth, of a fine Colour, and white and ſmooth Skin; the forme of her Face was long, and never any One but ſhe in the world was embeliſhed with a long Chin; her hair was brown, and ſhe was ever Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly dreſt, but her finery proceeded rather from Art than the magnificence of her Clothes; her Will was free and naturall, her Humour cannot be deſcribed, for it was with the Modeſty of her Sex of the Humour of all the World. People by much think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of what they have to do, think uſually better at the end than at the beginning. The contrary happened uſually to the Counteſs, her Reflections ſpoyled her firſt Motions. I know not if the Confidence ſhe had in her Merit made her careleſs of ſeeking Lovers, for ſhe took no pains at all to have them. And indeed when any One of himſelf made his addreſſes to her, ſhe neither affected Rigour to be rid of him, nor Kindneſs to retain him, he left of his Courtſhip if he pleaſed, if he pleaſed he

continued it: and what courſe ſoever he took he did not ſubſiſt to her coſt.

The Counteſs returning ſome time after to <hi>Paris,</hi> the Chevalier not being tyed to Madam <hi>Villars</hi> by any favours, quitted her to return to the Counteſs; but as he was never long in the ſame ſtate, and being tyred with her, he made his addreſſes to Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> at the ſame time that <hi>Marſillac</hi> entred into an engagement with her, and tho the Chevalier was leſs Modeſt than <hi>Marſillac</hi> with the Ladies, he was not however the more preſſing; on the contrary provided he might toy with 'em, have it ſaid in the world that he was in love, find ſome People of eaſie belief to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his vanity, put a Rival in pain, be better received than he, he was not at all fond of a ſurrender. One thing he did that made it more difficult for him to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade than it was for another, was that he never ſpoke ſeriouſly. Inſomuch that a Woman muſt needs flatter her ſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely, to beleive he was in love with her.</p>
            <p>I have already ſaid that never any Gallant that was not beloved was more incommode than he, he had ever two or three Lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quies without Liveries, whom he called his Bloodhounds, whom he cauſed to dog and obſerve his Rivals and his Miſtreſſes.
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:61590:26"/>
Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> being in pain One day how ſhe ſhould go to an Aſſignation ſhe had made with <hi>Marſillac,</hi> without being diſcovered by the Chevalier, reſolved for her pleaſure to go hooded up with her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Maid, and to Paſs the River in a Boat; after having given orders to her ſervants to go wait for her at <hi>Fauxbourgs Saint Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,</hi> the firſt Man who gave her his hand to help her into the Boat, was the Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers Bloodhound, before whom, without knowing him, ſhe had been merry with her Chamber Maid, for that ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Chevalier, and talked of what they were going to do that day; this Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound went immediately to acquaint his Maſter, who ſtrangly ſurpriſed Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> the next day, when he acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her with the perticulars of her Rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouz of the Evening before.</p>
            <p>An honeſt welbred Man having convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his Miſtreſs of loving another than himſelf, withdraws immediately and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out noiſe, particularly if ſhe had not made him any promiſe; but the Chevalier was not of that humour; when he could not procure being beloved, he would rather choſe to have been ſtabbed than leave his Miſtreſs and Rival in repoſe.

               <hi>d' Olonne</hi> having reckoned for nothing the Aſſiduities that the Chevalier had payed her for three Months together, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Raillery all that he had told her of his Paſſion, and the more for that ſhe was perſwaded, that he had as great an one for the Counteſs as he could have for her, ſhe hated him as the Devil. Then this Lover fancying that a Letter would do his buiſneſs much better than all he had done or ſaid thitherto, in that Opinion he writ to her in theſe termes.</p>

Tho it be uſeleſs to have recourſe with you to thoſe Declarations which we are forced to have with mortal Beauties, and that mental Prayers, ought to ſuffice you, I have told you athouſand times that I loved you; yet you laugh and make me no anſwer; Is this a good or an ill ſign my Queen, I conjure you to explain your ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that the moſt paſſionate of mortals may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to adore you, and ceaſe to diſpleaſe you.</hi>

            <p>Madam <hi>d'Olonne</hi> having received this Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, carried it immediately to the Counteſs, with whom ſhe fancyed it had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:61590:27"/>
but did not ſeem to beleive any ſuch thing at firſt. As there was alwayes a ſeeming kindneſs between them, ſhe ſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling valued at a high rate her refuſing her Lover, and the notice ſhe gave of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity he would have committed. This vexed the Counteſs, tho ſhe did not love the Chevalier: moſt Women are no more willing to loſe their Lovers whom they had no kindneſs for than thoſe they favour, and particularly when they abandon them to give themſelves to others, and their Vexation does not ſo much proceed from the loſs they have as from the preference of their Rivals: which was the Counteſſes caſe in this encounter. However ſhe thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> for the intention ſhe had to oblige her, but proteſted ſhe had no engagement with the Chevalier, but that on the contrary ſhe ſhould be obliged to thoſe who would rid her of him. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> did not content her ſelf with ſhewing that Letter to the Counteſs, ſhe likewiſe vapoured with it to <hi>Marſillac;</hi> and whether ſhe or the Counteſs ſpoke of it to others, every body knew that the Poor Chevalier had been ſacrificed, and he himſelf was quickly acquainted with the jeaſts that were made upon his Letter.
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:61590:28"/>
Contempt offends all Lovers, but when Raillery is joyned with it they are netled to the heart: The Chevalier ſeeing himſelf Caſheired and laughed at, kept no longer any meaſures, he ſaid all manner of ill things of Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> and it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in this Occaſion, that this fooliſh Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man had found the ſecret of loſing her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation by preſerving her Honour of being Cruel, and cryed out upon for a Gilt.</p>
            <p>The Chevalier hated none of his Rivals ſo much as he did <hi>Marſillac,</hi> as well becauſe he thought him better treated, as for that he fancyed he the leaſt deſerved it: he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s Lovers, the Philiſtins, and ſaid that <hi>Marſillac</hi> by reaſon he had but little Wit, had defeated them all with the Jaw bone Bone of an Aſs.</p>
            <p>In this ſame time the Count of <hi>Guiche,</hi> the Mareſchal of <hi>Grammont</hi>'s Son, as beautiful as an Angell, and full of Love, fancyed that the conqueſt of the Counteſs would be both eaſie and honorable to him; inſomuch that he reſolved to undertake it out of motives of Glory; he mentioned it to <hi>Manicamp</hi> his ſaithful and neceſſary Friend, who approved his deſigne, and offered to ſerve him in it. The Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> and <hi>Manicamp</hi> have ſo great a part
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:61590:28"/>
in this ſtory, that it is neceſſary to ſpeak of them <hi>en paſſant,</hi> and make them per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly known; and in order to that it is fit I begin with the deſcription of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
            <p>The count <hi>de Guiche</hi> had great black Eyes, a handſome Noſe, well made, his Mouth was ſomething wide, the forme of his Face round, his Complexion was admirable, had a great Forehead and a fine Shape: he had Wit, was very know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, addicted to raillery, light, preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous, brave, haſty and without friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip: he was Colonel of the French Gards, jointly with the Mareſchal of <hi>Grammom</hi> his Father.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Manicamp</hi> had ſweet blew Eyes, a Hawk's Noſe, a wide Mouth, his Lips were very red and full, his Complexion was ſomething yellow, his Face was flat, his Haire thick long and white, his Shape was fine if it had not been too much neglected: As for Wit ſhe had enough of the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s ſort; he had not acquired ſo much, but his <hi>Genius</hi> way at leaſt as good; his Fortune not being ſo well ſetled as the others, made him ſomething the more cautious; but they had naturally both the ſame incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations to the hinder parts and to raillery;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:61590:29"/>
and indeed they loved one another as ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently as if they had been of different Sexes.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the World the Chevalier <hi>de Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi>'s Letter, he diſcovered the love the Count <hi>de Guicke</hi> had for the Counteſs of <hi>Fieſque,</hi> this was of no ſmall uſe to him for the making her fall out with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> fancying his Reconciliation would be the more eaſy with the Counteſs, the leſs he kept meaſures with the others: but while he is endeavouring to make Peace for himſelf, let us ſe what the Count <hi>de Guicke</hi> did to render himſelf lovely. Firſt you muſt know then that the Count had a very great paſſion for Mademoiſelle <hi>de Beauvais,</hi> a Maid of mean Birth, but of a great deal of Wit; it muſt likewiſe be known that he had been ſo traverſed by his Relations in that Amour, that they feared ſhe would make him commit the ſame folly, that his Siſter had cauſed the Marqueſs of <hi>Richilieu</hi> to do, whom that Conſideration, as well as the Rigours of the faire One, had very much diſguſted, and had the deeper engaged him in the deſign of Loving the Counteſs; but he had not for this fair One, all the inclination ſhe deſerved, and it was leſs a ſecond paſſion than a Remedy to the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:61590:29"/>
former. But he got little ground, &amp; all that he could do was to move the Counteſs and to put the Chevalier into diſpair; and for that end he kept to Lookes and Aſſiduities, without caring to ſpur on faſter. The Counteſs, whoſe heart, as is beleived, was never ſmitten with any thing but the merit of <hi>Guiſtand,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi>'s Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite, whom ſhe had not ſeen in four or five years, but with whom ſhe had kept a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of Letters, felt her Conſtancy ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Count <hi>de Guiches</hi> addreſſes, and notwithſtanding all that <hi>Gerſé, Guiſtavel</hi>'s friend, could ſay to her, for the obliging her to chace away the Count, ſhe would not at firſt yeild to it, but ſeemed to ridicule that Amour, and a long time elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Counſels of all her friends: yet at length ſhe her ſelf perceiving that the Count took no advantage of it, ſhe reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to procure her ſelf honour by making a Virtue of the neceſſity ſhe beleived her ſelf in of loving her, and that this might not ſeem a Sacrifice to the Chevalier, who had bragged he could cauſe his Nephew to be Caſhiered, ſhe turned them both off, yeilding at that time to the adviſe of <hi>Gerſé,</hi> as ſhe told him; and hereupon was made this jeaſt, that the Counteſs was
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:61590:30"/>
going to ſigne the Diſcharges and Paſſports of her Lovers, but the Chevalier cauſed her to be ſo intreated by her beſt Friends, that he obtained leave to ſee her at a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nights end, and it was upon this that this Song was made to the tune of Saraband.</p>

            <p>Five or ſix Months being paſſed, during which the Chevalier was too happy, he was not troubled with his Nephew, had enjoyed the pleaſures of ſolely loving the Counteſs; ſome friends of the Count <hi>de Gutche</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him that being the handſomeſt Man of the Court, it was a ſhame for him to find any Lady cruel, and that the ſucceſs he had had with the Counteſs had done him any injury in the world: theſe reaſons made him reſolve to reingage himſelf: He returned from he Campagne wounded in his Right Hand, but his Wound, tho great, not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:61590:30"/>
having hindred him from going abroad ſome times, he met the Counteſs One day in the <hi>Tuilleryes:</hi> He had the Abbot <hi>Fouequett</hi> with him, who was that Lady's particular friend, who thinking to do them a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, engaged them in diſcourſe, and left them together a pretty long time. The Count ſaid nothing at all of love, but his ways and his looks made the Counteſs underſtand but too much, nay more than he deſigned ſhe ſhould: This Converſation was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ended by the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s ſainting away, out of which he was recovered by the help of the Counteſs and the Abbot.</p>
            <p>Their Opinion of the cauſe of his ſaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away were divers, the Abbot attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to the Counts wound, and the Counteſs to his paſſion. A Woman be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves nothing more willingly than that ſhe is beloved, becauſe Love makes her beleive that ſhe ought to be beloved, and becauſe One is not hard to be perſwaded of what One deſires. Theſe reaſons made the Counteſs not at all doubt of the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s Love. At that time Madam <hi>de Olonne</hi> not being willing that a young ſpark ſo well made ſhould eſcape her, deſired <hi>Vieneuil</hi> to bring the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> to her, but this Gentleman's time was not yet

come, he went from thence as free as he came thither.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:61590:33"/>
without the leaſt reflexion: All the Counteſſe's vivacity could not make her i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magine what the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> meant by his being diſſatisfied with <hi>Manicamp;</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that ſhe ordered one of her Servants to go tell him, he ſhould come and ſee her on the Morrow, being reſolved to rattle him for the Letter he had given her from the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> and to forbid him to charge himſelf with any more for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. As he entred the Chamber the next day, her Curioſity made her forget her Anger: <hi>Well,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>tell me your quarrel with your Friend. It is, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>that as I was bringing you a Letter two days ago, I loſt it, and he is enraged againſt me, and I know not what to ſay to him, for I am in the fault.</hi> The Counteſs fearing this loſt Letter might be found by ſome one who might make a Story of it, to make the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Sport; <hi>Go,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>go ſeek it every where, and do not return till you have brought it me back. Manicamp</hi> went away immediately, and returned in the Evening to tell her, that he could not find it, that the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> would no longer ſee him, and that he came to beſeech her to reconcile them. <hi>I will,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>tho you do not deſerve it: And I ſhall go to morrow to</hi>

Do not think of him in this Occaſion, give this Letter to the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip you have for me, and I promiſe that when it has done the buſineſs, I will return it into your hands.</hi> The Counteſs having made him engage his word he would bring back her Letter, ſhe writ to him the day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in theſe terms.</p>

            <p>That advice was to be very diſtruſtful of the Chevalier, who did all he could to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe his Nephew, and to make him appear indiſcreet and unfaithful to the Counteſs. After that <hi>Manicamp</hi> told her that the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſhe had written to the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> had ſo tranſported him with joy, that it was impoſſible to get it from him, but that ſhe ſhould not be in pain, for that it would be as ſafe in his Friends hands as in the fire;
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:61590:35"/>
and moreover, that he had never ſeen a Man ſo much in love as the Count was, and that he would certainly love her as long as he lived. <hi>But,</hi> interrupted the Counteſs, <hi>what is the meaning of ſo many Viſits that your Friend makes to Madam</hi> d' Olonne? <hi>Does he go to deſire her to intercede with me for him? He does not viſit her at all, Madam,</hi> anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Manicamp, that is to ſay, he has been there but once or twice; but I diſcover the Chivali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers Malice in what you tell me, and I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Count</hi> de Guiche <hi>will know this Kna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh trick to be of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nkles stamp. But, Madam, hear my Friend before you Condemn him. I am of your Opinion,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him; and indeed <hi>Manicamp</hi> gueſſed right: For the Chevalier had told the Counteſs that the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> was in love with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> that ſhe only ſerved for a Pretext, and a thouſand other things of that Nature, that appeared to her ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that though ſhe diſtruſted the Chevali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in what concerned the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> ſhe could not forbear giving Credit to him in this Encounter. The next day a Lady of her Acquaintance being come to preſs her to go into the Country, ſhe let herſelf be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded: And really fancying the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> falſe, ſhe would not come to any

The Chevalier, who had an Eye upon all the Counteſſes Actions, and had bribed all her Servants, had the Pacquet ſhe ſent to <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tand</hi> two hours after it was made up. He took a Copy of the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and caſt the Pacquet into the Fire.

While this Letter was a carrying to the Counteſs, the Chevalier went to ſeek out his Nephew, with whom he found <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp.</hi> After a Prologue of Raillery upon the good Fortunes of the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> in General: <hi>Faith, my poor Friends,</hi> ſaid he to them, <hi>I confeſs you are younger and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeler than I am, and I ſhall never diſpute with you a Miſtreſs I have not been a long time ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with: But however, you muſt yield the Counteſs to me, and all thoſe I have any Engagement with. The Vanity Women take in a great number of Galants may oblige them to give you ſome hopes. There are few who at the firſt onſet will ſtifle the Vows of their Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers: But ſooner or later they return to reaſon; and it is then that the new Comer paſſes his time very ill, and that the old Gallant jointly with his Miſtreſs cry, Farewel you Gentlemen Serenaders. You promiſed me, Count</hi> de Guiche, <hi>never to torment me more, as to what concerns the Counteſs; you have broke your word, and committed an infidelity that has done you no good: For the Counteſs has given me all the Letters you wrote to her; I'le ſnow you the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals when you will: In the mean time here is a Copy of the laſt Letter you ſent her;</hi> and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, he took out a Letter of the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s, and having read it; <hi>Well! my</hi>

               <hi>Dears,</hi> ſaid he to them, <hi>you'l hunt upon my grounds again, will you?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the Chevalier was ſpeaking, the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> and <hi>Manicamp</hi> looked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazedly upon one another, not being able to comprehend that the Counteſs had ſo baſely deceived them. At length <hi>Manicamp</hi> broak ſilence, and addreſſing himſelf to the Count, <hi>You are treated,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>as you deſerved; but ſince the Counteſs has not had any Conſideration for us,</hi> added he, turning towards the Chevalier, <hi>we are not obliged to have any for her: We eaſily perceived we have been Sacrificed, but there was a time, Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, that you was ſo too; We have indeed great reaſon to complain of her, but you have none at all to be ſatisfied with her: When we ſome times rejoyced and were merry at your Coſts, the Counteſs went halves with us at the leaſt. The truth is,</hi> ſaid the Count <hi>de Guiche, that you would not have, reaſon to be ſatisfied with the Counteſſes preference in your Favours, if you knew the esteem ſhe has of you; and this makes me draw infallible Conſequences that ſhe is deeply engaged with you, ſince after all the things ſhe has told me, ſhe only betrays me to give you ſatisfaction.</hi> Thereupon being all three really reconciled, and having given one another a thouſand Aſſurances of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:61590:37"/>
Friendſhip for the future, they parted.</p>
            <p>The Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> and <hi>Manicamp</hi> ſhut themſelves up to make a Letter of reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in <hi>Manicamps</hi> Name to the Counteſs, to which the poor Counteſs being innocent, made anſwer, that he and his Friend had been taken for Cullies, and that the Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier was cunninger than they; that ſhe could not tell by what means he had got the Letter he had ſhowed them, but that they One day ſhould clearly ſee that ſhe had not made a Sacrifice of them. This Letter not finding <hi>Manicamp</hi> any longer at <hi>Paris,</hi> he being gone out the day before with the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> to follow the King in his Progreſs to <hi>Lyons,</hi> he did not receive it till he arrived at Court, and thought neither the more, nor the leſs advantageouſly of the Counteſs: during all theſe paſſages, <hi>Marſillac</hi>'s Intrigue with Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> jogged on; that Lover ſeeing her with the greateſt conveniency imaginable by night at her Houſe, and by day at Mademoiſelle <hi>de Cornuelle</hi>'s, a lovely Creature, and of a great deal of Wit.

               <hi>Marſillac</hi> did not fail to be at the Aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation much ſooner than ordinary; In accoſting his Miſtreſs he flung himſelf upon her Bed, and was thus a long time melting into tears, and all his words were interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſobs.

However as young People recover eaſily, and he being of a good complexion,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:61590:38"/>
he began to come to himſelf, and recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his ſtrength in a little time: Inſomuch that Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> could hardly diſcover he had been ſo lately ill.

Thereupon they made a thouſand Proteſtations of loving one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all their life-time; they agreed of the means of writing, and then took leave, the one to go to Court, the other to the Wells.

               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:61590:39"/>
               <hi>not in Concert together. Pret hee tell me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly my Dear, added ſhe, what I muſt do to love well, and entertain a Gallantry, that ſhall do me no injury in the world, tho it ſhould be ſuſpected: For I am reſolved to do my Devoir in the future with the utmoſt Regularity. There are ſo many things to ſay upon that point,</hi> ſaid Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>Cornuelle, that I ſhould never have don, if I would neglect nothing, however I ſhall tell you the principal as ſuccinctly as poſſible.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt you muſt know Madam, that there are three ſorts of Women who make love, The Debauchées, the Cocquets, and the honeſt Miſtreſſes. Tho the firſt are abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, they certainly deſerve more compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on than hatred, becauſe they are hurryed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way by the force of their Temper, and that almoſt an impoſſible application is required to reforme Nature; however if in any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter we ought to conquer our ſelves, it is in that, wherein no leſs is concerned than our honours or lives.</p>
            <p>As for Cocquets, the number being much greater, I ſhall enlarge more upon that point: The difference between De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchées, and them, is, that in the Ill the former commit, there is at leaſt ſincerity, and in what the Cocquets do there is Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery: The Cocquets tell us to excuſe
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:61590:40"/>
themſelves when they give ear to the Courtſhip of all Comers, that how ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt ſoever a Woman is, ſhe never hates a perſon who tells her he loves her.</p>
            <p>But one may anſwer them that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are to be made: either that Lover addreſſes himſelf to a Woman, who will be either honeſt for her ſelf or for a Lover: allow that ſhe cannot hate a Man for the Sentiments he had for her, yet this will not hinder her from being carefull of not having ſo much Complaiſance for him as for another, who had never declared any thing to her, for fear ſhe ſhould thereby entertain his hopes, and that at length it might make a noiſe, and be injurious to the reputation ſhe would preſerve.</p>
            <p>If the Woman be prepoſſeſſed that the Man declares love to her, ſhe will have the ſame precautions as the other to hinder it from continuing, but if he perſiſts, I maintain that ſhe ſhall hate him as much as ſhe ſhall love her true Gallant: it being natural to hate the Enemies of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon we love, becauſe love will not allow love to be importunate, and becauſe that a Lover well treated may ſuſpect that a Paſſion that continues in his Rival, is at<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>leaſt nouriſhed by ſome hopes; an honeſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:61590:40"/>
Miſtreſs conſiders his Rival as her mortal Enemy, who maks her run the riſque of loſing her Lover whom ſhe loves more than her life. This being plain, you muſt likewiſe know that there are ſeveral ſorts of Cocquets; ſome take a pride in being beloved by a great many People, without ever loving any of them, and do not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that it is the advances themſelves make which invite men, and which retain them rather than merit. Beſides as it is not poſſible they ſhould diſpoſe their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours ſo equally, but that ſome one will ſeem better treated than others, and there being ſome who will not content them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with equality, but pretend to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; This gives jealouſy to the Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, and makes them ſay in quitting them, all, nay more than they know.</p>
            <p>There are other Cocquets who manage ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Lovers, that they may ſave the real one in the multitude, and cauſe it to be ſaid, they have no amorous Intrigue, ſince they treat e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually all thoſe who viſit them; but the beſt luck that can happen to them is to have the truth diſcovered; or at leaſt, it is better than by believing they love no Body, every one ſancies they love All.</p>
            <p>There are others who by managing ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:61590:41"/>
Gallants would fain perſwade, that if they ſhould love any one of them, they ſhould hazard the vexing him, In the mean time they vex and loſe him by theſe means. For to imagine that it is in the abſence of their true Lover that they make love, he will know nothing of it; or if it is in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, by acting in concert together, he will eaſily ſee that is nothing, ſince he is taken for a Witneſs of what is done, or at all hazards if he is troubled, their Careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him, and their Promiſes to do ſo no more, will oblige him to be ſatisfied. All this is very ſubject to caution, a Lover is not long deceived, and if he does not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover it to day, he will diſcover it to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>

            <p>And tho his Paſſion ſhould be ſo ſtrong, that he could not get rid of it, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and noiſe he would make, would occaſion more vexation to the Cocquet Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs than all thoſe managements could have procured her Pleaſure. There are Cocquets who fancy they have ſo ill a repute in the World, that they dare not be cruel and rigorous to any man, for fear it ſhould paſs for a Sacrifice to ſome other, and ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:61590:41"/>
think that it would be better for their Honour that they were convicted of Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: This is, Madam, the Courſe the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quets take. I muſt let you ſee that of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Miſtreſſes.</p>
            <p>As for them, they are either ſatisfied with their Lovers, or they are not: If they are not, they endeavour to reduce them to their Devoir by a tender and civil Carriage: If this cannot abſolutely be, they break off without noiſe, upon a pretext of Devotion, or the Jealouſie of a Husband, after having got from them, if they can, their Letters, and all that could Convict them: And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things they ſo contrive it, that their Lovers do not fancy they abandom them for others.</p>
            <p>If they are ſatisfied with their Lovers, they love them with all their hearts, they are continually telling it them, and they write them the kindeſt Letters they can: But as this does not prove their love, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Coquets ſay as much, or more every day, their Actions and their Carriage does ſufficiently juſtifie the meaning of their Hearts, becauſe there is only that inſallible. We can indeed ſay, We love tho we do not, but we cannot ſeem kind to any one long without having an affection for him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:61590:42"/>
An honeſt Miſtreſs is more afraid of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Jealouſie to her Gallant than of Death, and when ſhe ſees him alarmed with any Suſpicion that the obſtinacy of his Rival might give him, ſhe does not content her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the teſtimony of her Conſcience, ſhe redoubles her Cares and Careſſes for him, and her rigours for the other; ſhe does not defer the extreameſt Severity till ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, fancying ſhe could never be ſoon enough rid of an importunate Perſon. She knows that as many Moments as ſhe defers the chacing away this Rival, ſhe ſhould give as many ſtabs in his Heart ſhe is in love with. She knows that as ſoon as her Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver begins to have Suſpicious, the leaſt care ſhe ſhould take to remove them, would preſerve in him the eſteem and love he has for her; whereas if ſhe neglected to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie and cure him, he would come again to have ſo little Confidence in her, that ſhe ſhould not be able to recover his good O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, tho ſhe even offered him to loſe her Reputation for his ſake. She knows that a Lover would ever believe, that it would be the fear ſhe was in of him, had forced thoſe Sacrifices from her, that at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother time he would have took for great Marks of love. She knows that in the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:61590:42"/>
a Man confides in, all is excuſed, and that nothing is pardoned in her that is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted. She knows that at length a Man comes to be fatigued with the trouble a Miſtreſs gives him, and the reproaches that he has made her after having pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her a thouſand conſiderable Faults, that he breaks off upon a Trifle, the meaſures being plain, and he not able to ſuffer any longer ſo much vexation.</p>
            <p>There are Women who love their Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants extreamly, and yet make them jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous by their ill carriage, and this proceeds from their ſlattering themſelves too much with the aſſurance they have of their good Intentions, and for that they do not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently quaſh the hopes of thoſe men, who make Court to them, or who only ſeem to love them by their Cares and their Aſſidui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; and they are ignorant that the Civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of a Woman one loves, are ſuch Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours as all Lovers flatter themſelves with ſometimes, becauſe they have Merit; or of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten becauſe they think they have ſo: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times becauſe they have no good Opinion of the Perſons they make their Addreſſes to, and who fancy that the reſiſtance that they make is only to ſet a greater value up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves. Inſomuch, that if a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:61590:43"/>
who has never given occaſion to be talked of, is ſtill very jealous of her Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, ſhe ought to take care, as I have already ſaid, not to entertain in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the hopes of all that has the Air of a Lover, and if it is a Woman who has not thitherto been careful enough of her Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, but deſigns to be ſo for the future, which is your caſe, Madam, it is requiſite that ſhe be more rude than another, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially that ſhe be impartial in her Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, for the leaſt favour ſhe ſhall let herſelf looſe to, does more reingage a Lover than a thouſand Refuſals does diſguſt him.</p>
            <p>An honeſt Miſtreſs has ſo much ſincerity for her Lover, that rather than fail to tell him things of conſequence, ſhe tells him even what are trifles: Well knowing, that if he came to be informed by other means of certain indifferent things, that are rendred Criminal at their being told again, it would have the worſt effect imaginable. She keeps no Meaſures with him in point of Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſhe tells him not only her own ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, but even thoſe ſhe knew before, or what ſhe learns elſewhere every day. She calls thoſe people ridiculous, Who ſay, that being Miſtreſs of anothers Secrets, we ought not to tell it our Lovers: She an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:61590:43"/>
to that, that if they ſtill love us, they will never ſay any thing of it: And if they happen to abandon us, we ſhould have much more to loſe than our Friends ſecret; but ſhe fancies, we ought never to conſider them, as ſuch as will one day leave off loving us, and that otherwiſe we ſhould be Fools to grant them Favours.</p>
            <p>In a word, her Maxim is, That who gives her heart has nothing more to manage; ſhe knows that there are only two Encounters that can diſpence her from telling all to her Lover; the one if he was indiſcreet, and the other if he had any Gallantry before hers. For it would be imprudence in her to ſpeak to him in that caſe, at leaſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he preſſed her extreamly, and then it would be he himſelf that occaſioned his own Vexation.</p>
            <p>Finally, an honeſt Miſtreſs believes that what juſtifies her Love even with the moſt ſevere Men, is, when ſhe is deeply ſmitten, when ſhe takes pleaſure in making it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to her Lover, when ſhe ſurprizes him by a thouſand little favours, that he did not expect; when ſhe has no reſerve for him; when ſhe applies herſelf to procure him eſteem amongſt all People: and that in a word, ſhe makes of her Paſſion the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:61590:44"/>
buſineſs of her Life: Without this, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, ſhe holds Love for a Debauche, and that it is a Brutal Commerce, and a Trade by which ruined Women ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>Mademoiſelle <hi>de Cornuelle</hi> having left off ſpeaking, Good God! ſaid Madam <hi>d' O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne,</hi> what fine things have you now ſaid; but how difficult are they to be put in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice? I even find therein ſome injuſtice; for in a word, ſince we even deceive our Husbands, whom the Laws have made our Maſters, why ſhould our Gallants come off at a better rate? They whom nothing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges us to love but the choice we make, and whom we take to ſerve us as long, and as little as we pleaſe. I did not ſay, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Mademoiſelle <hi>de Cornuelle,</hi> that we ought not to abandon our Gallants, when they diſpleaſe us either by their own defects, or our wearineſs; but I have ſhown you the nice manner by which you ought to diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage your ſelf from them, not to give them any reaſon to cry out upon you in the world: For in a word, Madam, ſince they have im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that tyranny upon the Honour of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, not to love what they find lovely, we muſt comply with Cuſtome, and conceal our ſelves at leaſt when we will love. Well! my Dear, ſaid Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> to her, I
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:61590:44"/>
am going to act wonders, I am fully reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of it, but withal I ground the greateſt hopes of my Conduct upon avoiding Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>Whether it be by avoiding, or reſiſtance, ſaid Mademoiſelle <hi>de Cornuelle,</hi> it is no matter, provided your Lover be ſatisfied with you; and thereupon having exhorted her to remain firm in her good Intentions, ſhe took her leave.</p>
            <p>During Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s ſeparation from <hi>Marſillac,</hi> they wrote to one another very often, but as there was nothing therein remarkable, I ſhall not mention their Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which ſpoke of their love, and of their impatience to ſee one another again, but in a very common manner. Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> was the firſt who returned to <hi>Paris;</hi> the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> during the Progreſs to <hi>Lyons,</hi> perſwaded <hi>Monſieur,</hi> the King's Brother, with whom he was much in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, to have a Gallantry at his return to <hi>Paris</hi> with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> and had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered himſelf to ſerve him in it, and to procure him content in a ſhort time. This Prince had promiſed the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> to make the neceſſary Paces to engage that Cocquet, inſomuch that in the Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions he had with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> he on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:61590:45"/>
ſpoke to her of the love that Prince had for her: He told her that he had declared it to him more than an hundred times up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Journey, and that ſhe would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſee him ſigh aſſoon as he was return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A Woman who had Citizens and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen her Gallants, ſome handſome, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ugly, might well love a comely Prince, Madam <hi>a' Olonne</hi> received the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s Propoſition with an unexpreſſible joy; and it was ſo great, that ſhe did not ſo much as make thoſe Excuſes which Coquets make in ſuch like Encounters. Another would have ſaid that ſhe would not love a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one, but leſs a Prince than any man ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, becauſe he would not have ſo much application. Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> who was the moſt natural Woman in the World, and the moſt paſſionate, kept no bounds of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, but anſwered the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> That ſhe eſteemed herſelf more than ſhe had yet done, ſince ſhe pleaſed ſo great and ſo rational a Prince. When the Court was returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> did not anſwer the eagerneſſes, the Count had prepared Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> for, who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered herſelf all entirely. All this produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced nothing, and made her but the more know how indifferent ſhe was to that
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:61590:45"/>
Prince. The Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> ſeeing that the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> did not bite at the Hook, changed his Deſign, and was deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous at leaſt that the Services he would have rendred to Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> ſhould be of ſome advantage to him. Whereupon he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to act the part of a Lover himſelf, and being the Commerce he had had with her upon the Amours of the Duke of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leans,</hi> had made him very familiar, he did not balance to write to her this Letter.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

            <p>Let People ſay what they will againſt Women, there is ſometimes more impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence than malice in their Conduct: Moſt of them no longer think, when they are courted, that they ought never to love: In the mean time they proceed further than they imagine, they do things ſometimes, thinking they ſhall be always Cruel, which they extreamly repent of, when they are become more Humane. The ſame thing happened to Madam <hi>d' Olonne;</hi> ſhe was ſtung to the quick that ſhe had failed of the Prince's Heart, after having reckoned it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt her Conqueſts; in ſeeking ſome one to apply herſelf to for the amuſing her grief, ſhe found nothing more likely to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, than that the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> for his own Intereſt had hindred him from loving her. Inſomuch that as well to revenge her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of him, as to reaſſure <hi>Marſillac,</hi> whom this Intrigue had alarmed, ſhe ſacrificed to him the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s Letter, without conſidering that Love would perhaps ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:61590:46"/>
her to do the ſame with thoſe of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillac,</hi> and he whom Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> gave a thouſand Favours to, made the uſe of them that is common, when one is ſatisfied with his Miſtreſs, he rendred her a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand thanks for her Sincerity, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf with triumphing over his Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, without ſhowing any indiſcreet Pride.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> not knowing the Deſtiny of his Letter, went the day after to Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s Houſe; but ſo much Company was there that day, that he could not ſpeak to her about buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at that time. He only obſerved that ſhe had eyed him very much, and from her Houſe he went to acquaint <hi>Fieſque</hi> with the ſtate of his Affairs, who ſince his return from <hi>Lyons,</hi> he had made his Conſident; he went likewiſe to tell the ſame to <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil;</hi> and they both judged by the weakneſs of the Lady, and the Gentleneſs of the Spark, that his purſuit would neither be long nor in vain: And the truth is, Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> had found the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> ſo handſome, and ſo much to her mind, that ſhe repented the Sacrifice ſhe had newly made to <hi>Marſillac.</hi> The day after the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> returned to her Houſe, and
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:61590:47"/>
having found her alone, he ſpoke to her of his Paſſion, the fair One was pleaſed, and received that Declaration the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greably imaginable; but after having agreed upon loving one another, as they were up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on certain Conditions, People came in; which obliged the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> to go out a Moment after.</p>
            <p>Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> having diſingaged her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from her Company as ſoon as ſhe was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, took Coach, being deſirous to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver if the Counteſs <hi>de Fieſque</hi> took no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt any longer in the Count <hi>de Guiche:</hi> She went to her, and after ſome Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon other ſubjects, ſhe asked her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in the Deſignes ſhe told her the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> had for her. The Counteſs told her that ſhe was only to conſult her Heart in ſuch Occaſions: <hi>My heart does not ſay to me much in favour of the Count,</hi> replyed Madam <hi>d' Olonne, and my Reaſon tells me a thouſand things againſt him: He is a Spark I can never love.</hi> In ſaying theſe words, ſhe took leave of the Counteſs, without wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for her Anſwer.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing returned to his Houſe, he met with <hi>Vinevil,</hi> who waited for him with great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience to know what poſture his Affairs
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:61590:47"/>
were in; the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> told him ſomething coldly, that he believed all was broaken off, conſidering how Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> treated him; and <hi>Vinevil</hi> deſiring to know the particulars of the Converſation, the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> not being willing to diſcover what paſſed, changed diſcourſe every moment; this gave ſome ſuſpicions to <hi>Vineuil</hi> who was cunning and in love with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> and only concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelf in the affairs of the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> that he might prevail with his Miſtreſs by the things he ſhould have learnt. He went away ſeeing he could not make any diſcovery, and was for three days in mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal diſquiets, not being able to learn the certainty of what he ſuſpected, and what he would know. He went to <hi>Fieſque's</hi> Houſe with the Countenance of a diſgraced Favourite, ſince he ſaw he had no longer any ſhare in the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denc, he ſaid nothing of it to that fair One, not to diſcredit himſelf in ſhowing his Miſfortune,</p>
            <p>At three days end he went to the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s Houſe. <hi>What have I done my Lord,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>that obliges you to treat me thus? I eaſily perceive that you hide from me your intrigue with Madam</hi> de O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Olonne,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:61590:48"/>
               <hi>learn me the reaſon of it, or if you have none, continue to tell me what you know as you uſed to do I ask your pardon my poor</hi> Vinevil, ſaid the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> to him, <hi>but Madam</hi> d' Olonne <hi>upon granting me enjoyment, exacted from me not to ſpeak thereof to you nor to</hi> Fieſque, <hi>much leſs then to any others, becauſe ſhe ſaid that you are malicious, and</hi> Fieſque <hi>jealous. How indiſcreet ſoever a perſon is, there is no Intrigue but what's kept ſecret in the beginning, if there be no need of a Confident: This I have had experience of in this Occaſion, for I am naturally enough incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to tell an amourous adventure: And yet I have been three dayes without acquainting you with this, tho you know all my ſecrets; but have patience, my Dear, I am going to tell you all that paſſed between Madam</hi> d' Olonne <hi>and me, and by the exacteſt Relation in the World, in ſome manner requite the offence done to the friendſhip I have for you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You know then that the firſt Viſit made her, after having written to her the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you have ſeen, I did not ſind in her looks any averſion or kindneſs; and the Company that was at her houſe hindred me from having any further information. All that I could remarke was, that ſhe obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved me from time to time; but returning thither the day after, and having found her
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:61590:48"/>
alone, I repreſented my love to her ſo well, and ſo eagerly preſſed her to make returns to it, that ſhe Confeſſed ſhe loved me, and promiſed to give me marks thereof upon Condition I have newly told you. You know very well that I would promiſe her all in thoſe moments; we heard a noiſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> bid me come again the next day dreſſed in Womens Cloathes, and as one who brought her Lace to fell; whereupon being returned to my Houſe, I found you there, and you might eaſily perceive by the cold reception I made you, that all the World importuned me at that time, and particularly you, my Dear, whom I was more jealous of than any one; you likewiſe perceived it, and it was that which made you ſuſpect I did not tell you all: when you was gone, I gave order that my Porter ſhould ſay I was not at home, and prepared my ſelf for my Maſcarade of the Morrow: All the pleaſure that imagination can give beforehand, I had for four and twenty hours together: The four or five laſt hours were more tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than all the others; at length that which I expected with ſo much impatience, being come, I cauſed my ſelf to be carryed to Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s Houſe, I found her
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:61590:49"/>
in a Cornet upon her Bed, in a Roſe Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour Undreſs. I cannot expreſs to you my Dear, how beautifull ſhe was that day, all that can be ſaid, comes ſhort of the Charms ſhe had: her Neck was half uncovered, ſhe had more Hair looſe than uſual, and all in rings and curles, her Eyes were more ſparkling than the Stars. Love and the colour of her Face animated her Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion with the fineſt Vermillion in the World. <hi>Well, my Dear, ſaid ſhe to me, are not you full of acknowledgment that I ſpare you the pains of ſighing a long time? do you find that I make you pay too dear for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours you receive? Tell me my Dear,</hi> added ſhe, <hi>but you are mute. Ah! Madam</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I her, <hi>I ſhould be inſenſible were I in cold Blood, ſeeing you in this poſture. But may I aſſure my ſelf, ſaid ſhe, that you have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten little</hi> Beauvais <hi>and the Counteſs of</hi> Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſque? <hi>yes</hi> ſaid I to her, <hi>Madam, you may; and how ſhould I remember others,</hi> added I, <hi>ſince you may perceive I haue almoſt forgot my ſelf? I only fear,</hi> replyed ſhe, <hi>the future; for for the preſent, my Dear, I am much mistaken if I ſuffer you to think of any Body beſides myſelf;</hi> And in finiſhing theſe words ſhe took me about the Neck, and preſſing me you know how with her Arms, ſhe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:61590:49"/>
pulled me upon her; Both of us lying in manner, we kiſſed ill one another a thouſand times: But not willing to ſtop there, and this ſeeking for ſomething more ſolid; but on my part in vain. We ought to know our ſelves, and what we are fit for: For my part I perceive I am no Womans man. It was impoſſible for me to come off with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, what effect ſoever my fancy made, and the Idea and the preſence of the moſt beautifull Object in the World. <hi>What's the matter</hi> ſaid ſhe to me, <hi>My Lord, What ales you, What is it that puts you in ſo ſad a Condition? Is it my Perſon that diſguſts you, or do you only bring me the leavings of an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther?</hi> This Diſcourſe made me ſo aſhamed and out of Countenance, my Dear, that it quite deprived me of the forces I had left. <hi>I beg of you, Madam,</hi> ſaid I to her, <hi>not to ruine a wretch with reproaches! Certainly I am bewitched.</hi> In ſtead of giving me an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſhe called her Chamber-Maid, <hi>Prethee tell me</hi> Quentine <hi>how do I look to day? am not I very ugly? Do not deceive your Lady, there is ſomething about me that does not ſit well? Quentine</hi> not daring to anſwer ſeeing her in that rage, Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> ſnatching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looking-Glaſs from her ſhe held in her hands? After having made all the geſtures
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:61590:50"/>
ſhe uſed to do when ſhe deſigned to Charm any one to judge if my inſufficiency procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from her fault or mine. She got up and ſhaked her Petticoat that was ſomething ruffled, and went in a fury into her Cloſet that ſtood by her Bed-ſide. For my part, I was like a Condemned Man, I asked my ſelf if all that had paſſed was not a Dream, with all the reflections that one can make in ſuch an Encounter; I went to <hi>Manicamps</hi> Houſe, where having related to him all my adventure. <hi>I am mightly obliged to you, my Dear</hi> ſaid he to me, <hi>for certainly it was for the love of me that you were ſo inſenſible near ſo pretty a Woman. Tho perhaps you may be the Cauſe of it,</hi> ſaid I to him, <hi>I did it not to oblige you; I love you extreamely, and I do confeſs it; but with all that I had forgot you in that occaſion; I do not Comprehend ſo extraordinary an Obligation by quitting the habit of a Man: I had quitted you before, but that part is dead in me, by which I have been hitherto a kind of Chancellour.</hi> As I had done ſpeaking, one of my Servants brought me a Letter from Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> that one of hers had given him, here it is in my Pocket; in ſaying that the Count read this Letter to <hi>Vinevil.</hi>

                     <hi>IF I was a lover of Venereal pleaſures, I ſhould lament my having been diſappointed, but far from complaining; I am obliged to your inſufficiency, it is the cauſe that in the expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of delights you were not able to give me, I enjoyed others by imagination that laſted much longer than thoſe you could have been capable of furniſhing, tho you had been as well provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded as an other Man. I ſend at preſent to know how you do, and if you were able to get a foot to your Lodgings: It is not without reaſon that I make this inquiry, for I never ſaw a Man under ſuch ſad Circumſtances as you were when I left you. I Counſel you to ſettle your Affairs with more natural heat than you had when I ſaw you; for you cannot live much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Really my Lord, you raiſe my pity, and what outrage ſoever I have received from you, I ſhall not forbear giving you good advice. Avoid</hi> Manicamp <hi>if you are wiſe, you may recover your health, if you leave off ſeeking him for ſome time, it is certainly from him that your impotence proceeds: for my part neither my Glaſs nor my looks belying me, I do not fear being either accuſed or reproached.</hi>

                     <hi>I Confeſs, Madam I have had failings in my lifetime, for I am a man, and ſtill young; but I never had a worſe than that laſt Night. It is not to be excuſed Madam, and tho your ſentence be never ſo ſevere, it can be but what I have deſerved: I have killed, I have betrayed, I have committed ſacriledge; for all theſe Crimes you need only ſeek out puniſhments, if you pleaſe, my Death, I will bring you my ſword; if you only condemn me to be whipt, I will come naked to you in my ſhirt; Remember Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, that I failed in Power, not in Will; I was like a Brave ſoldier who finds himſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Arms when he ſhould engage: I ſhould be extreamly puzzel'd Madam, to tell you from whence this prov'd; perhaps it happend' to me as it does to thoſe whoſe ſtomack is gone when they expect to eat moſt, perhaps the force of Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation conſumed the force of Nature. See what it is, Madam, to be ſo Charming. An Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Beauty who ſhould not have troubled the Courſe of nature, would have been better enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. Adieu, Madam, I have nothing more to ſay to you, but that perhaps you would pardon me what is paſt, if you would give me the opportunity of doing better herafter, to which purpoſe I only demand till to morrow at the ſame hour as yeſterday.</hi>

After having ſent by one of my Footmen theſe fair promiſes to Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s Lacquis, who waited for an anſwer at my Houſe, I went home, and not doubting, but that my offers would be kindly received, I reſolved to take all imaginable Care of my ſelf: I bathed and was rubbed with Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, I eat new laid Eggs and Artichoaks, and then drunk ſome Wine; I walked a while in my Chamber, and then went to Bed without <hi>Manicamp.</hi> My Head was ſo full of the deſign of repairing my fault that I ſhun'd my Friends as I would have done the Plague. I got up the next day brisk both in Body and mind, I dined be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and eat what was Provocative, but as little as I had done at Supper; and having ſpent the Afternoon in preparing my little Equipages of Love, I went to Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s Houſe, at the ſame hour as the time before. I found her upon the ſame Bed, which made me immediately appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend that it portended me ſome ill Fortune; but in a word, having encouraged my ſelf as much as I could, I caſt my ſelf at her Knees. She was half undreſt, and held a Fan ſhe played with. So ſoon as ſhe ſaw me ſhe bluſht a little, without doubt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the late affront ſhe had received
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:61590:52"/>
and <hi>Quentine</hi> being retired, I placed my ſelf by her upon the Bed. The firſt thing ſhe did was to put her Fan before her Eyes, and that having rendred her as bold as if there had been a Wall between us both. <hi>Ah! Well,</hi> ſaid ſhe to me, <hi>poor Paralitick, are you come here a compleat Man to day? Ah! Madam</hi> anſwered I to her, <hi>let us talk no more of what is paſt:</hi> And thereupon thundering into her Arms, I kiſſed her a thouſand times, and begged ſhe would let me ſee her naked: after a little reſiſtance that ſhe made to augment my Deſires, and to affect Modeſty, which becomes a Woman ſo well, rather than out of any diſtruſt ſhe had of her ſelf, ſhe let me ſee all I had a mind to. I ſaw a curious, white, plump and the beſt proportioned Body in the world. After that I fell again to embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing her, we already made a noiſe with ſmacking and Buſſing, our hands already claſped in one another, expreſſed the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt tenderneſſes of love; already the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our loves had made the union of our Bodies, when ſhe perceived the ſad pickle I was in. It was then that ſeeing I continued to outrage her, ſhe thought of nothing but vengeance; ſhe called me all manner of ill names, ſhe there attended me
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:61590:52"/>
with the greateſt violence imaginable. For my part without making either Prayers or Complaints, knowing what I had deſerved, I went home in a fury and having put my ſelf to Bed, I turned all my choler againſt the cauſe of my Diſgrace.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Fury then ſeiz'd me, patience me forſook</l>
               <l>A Razor in my hand, enrag'd I took,</l>
               <l>But my deſigne I found was all in vain,</l>
               <l>Being the Author of my ſhameful pain.</l>
               <l>All in a fright, and quite froze up with fear,</l>
               <l>Some wrinckles of it only did appear.</l>
               <l>And towards it's Center ſeem'd to crow'd, I thought,</l>
               <l>And thus for refuge in my Belly ſought.</l>
            </q>
            <p>So that not being able to do any thing, the rage I was in made me talk to my ſelf much to this purpoſe. Ah! Traytor, what haſt thou to ſay, infamous part of my ſelf, and really ſhameful Member, for it would be very ridiculous to give thee an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther name? Tell me, have I ever obliged thee to uſe me in this manner? and make me receive the cruelleſt Affronts in the World? to make me abuſe the favours that are done me? and being but two and twenty make me have the infirmities of old
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:61590:53"/>
Age? while that Choler made me ſpeak thus.</p>
            <q>
               <l>
                  <hi>My Eyes towards Heaven I then did ghaſtly turn,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>My cruel Fate I did lament and mourn;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>I ſaw that all reproaches were in vain</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <hi>To talk to it, to rocks was to complain.</hi>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>I ſpent the Night in mortal Agonies, I knew not if I ought to write to Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> or ſurpriſe her by an unexpected Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit: at lenght after having been a long time conſidering, I choſe to do the laſt, at the hazard of finding an obſtacle to our plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; but I was ſo happy as to find her a lone; juſt as it grew dark. She had put her ſelf to Bed as ſoon as I was gone from her; At my Coming into her Chamber I told her, <hi>Madam,</hi> I <hi>come either to dy at your feet or give you ſatisfaction, I begg you would not be in a rage, I know what I have merited.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> who feared as much as I did ſuch an other miſchance as thoſe that had happned to me, took care not to daunt me with reproaches; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſhe told me all that might re-eſtabliſh in me a good opinion of my ſelf which I
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:61590:53"/>
had almoſt loſt; and faith, if I was enchanted, as I told her, two dayes before I break the Charme, the third time you may imagine, added the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> that ſhe called me no ill names at parting, as ſhe had done the other times: This is the ſtate of our Intrigue, which I begg you would ſeem to be ignorant of: <hi>Vinevil</hi> having promiſed him he would, they parted, the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> went to the Counteſs of <hi>Fieſque</hi>'s Houſe, to whom amongſt other things he ſaid he had no thoughts of Madam <hi>d' O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Gallant's Intrigue had not continued long with his new Miſtreſs when <hi>Marſillac</hi> diſcovered it, tho he had ſo little ſence, and ſhe had taken all imaginable care to deceive him; but jealouſy that ſerves in ſtead of cunning, made him diſcover in her leſs eagerneſs for him than was uſual. Inſomuch that having made her ſome Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt Complaints in the beginning, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards more ſharp ones, ſeeing at length they did not at all reſtrain her, he reſolved to revenge himſelf at one blow, both of his Rival and his Miſtreſs. Whereupon he gave his friends, Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and deſired them to ſhow 'em in all Companies. Mademoiſelle <hi>d' Orleans</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:61590:54"/>
the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> extreamly. He gave her the Letter the Count had written to his Miſtreſs, in which he had ſpoken ill of the Queen and the Duke of <hi>Orleans.</hi> The firſt thing the Prince did was to ſhow the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, thinking to animate him ſo much the more againſt him, for that ſhe knew that Prince had had a great kindneſs for him: however that Prince was not in ſo great a paſſion as ſhe hoped he would have been, and contented himſelf with telling <hi>Pequelain</hi> that his Coſin was ungrateful that he had never given him reaſon to talk of him as he did, and that all the reſentment he ſhould have of it was, to have no longer the ſame eſteem for him he had had; but if the Queen knew after what manner he had talked of her, ſhe would not certainly have ſo much moderation as ſhe had. The Princeſs not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well pleaſed to ſee his Royall highneſs ſo favourable, to the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to tell the Queen, and having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted one of her Confidents with her deſign, the Marſhal of <hi>Grammont</hi> came to hear of it. He went and beſeeched her not to ruine his ſon; ſhe promiſed him ſhe would not, and kept her word. This Princeſs was haughty and did not eaſily pardon
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:61590:54"/>
People, who had not for her all the reſpect her illuſtrious Birth and extraordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit obliged all the World to; but when ſhe was once perſwaded they loved her, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was ſo good natured as ſhe.</p>
            <p>While that the Marſhall and his Friends were endeavouring to ſtifle the Noiſe that <hi>Marſillac</hi> had made with the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi>'s Letter, Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> was known to ſhow this for the breaking of a Marriage that made <hi>Marſillac</hi>'s fortune.</p>
            <p>You do not think, Madam of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint I am in, I am ſorced to go two or three times a Week to viſit Mademoiſelle <hi>de Rochegayon,</hi> to talk to her as if I loved her, and to this purpoſe muſt ſpend that time I ought only to employ in ſeeing, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and thinking of you: and in what Condition ſoever I may be, it would be a great trouble to me to be obliged to keep company with a Child: but now that I live only for your ſake, you may very well imagine that it is to me the cruelleſt of Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: that which makes me take patience in ſome manner, is that I hope to revenge my ſelf on her by marrying her without loving her, and after that ſeeing more nearly the difference there is between you and her I ſhall love you all my life time, yet
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:61590:55"/>
more if it was poſſible than I do at preſent.</p>
            <p>This at firſt ſurprized all the World: Thitherto indiſcreet Gallants had only been found, and never Miſtreſſes: They could not imagine that a Woman to revenge her ſelf of a Man ſhe no longer loved, would help one in that manner to convict herſelf. This indiſcretion had not however the effect that Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> had promiſed herſelf: Monſieur <hi>de Liancourt,</hi> Mademoiſelle <hi>de la Rochegayon</hi>'s Father, knowing that Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> was deſirous to incenſe him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>Marſillac,</hi> anſwered thoſe who ſpoke to him of that Letter, That were it not for offending God, <hi>Marſillac</hi> could not do better than apply himſelf to gain the Heart of ſo beautyful a Lady as Madam <hi>d' Olonne;</hi> that this was not the firſt time that Wives were ſpoke ill of at Miſtreſſes Bed-ſide: But as the paſſion Men had for her, was more violent than that they had for others, it did not uſually laſt ſo long: As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that of <hi>Marſillac</hi> was not ſo fixed to Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> and he ſtill loved Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>de la Rochegayon.</hi> So that Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> did not ſpoil <hi>Marſillac</hi>'s For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, as ſhe hoped to have done; and only confirming what he had ſaid of her; ſhe deprived her friends of the means of vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicating her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="101" facs="tcp:61590:55"/>
Things being in theſe termes and the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> remaining Maſter in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> went one Evening to the Counteſs of <hi>Fieſque,</hi> ſhe prayed her to make her acknowledgments to the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> for ſome ſervice ſhe pretended to have received from him, and to exaggerate very highly the obligation ſhe had to him: But the Abbot being one of the principal Perſonages of this Hiſtory, it is requiſite to deſcribe how he was made.</p>
            <p>The Abbot <hi>Foucquett,</hi> the Treaſurers Brother, was originally of <hi>Anjou,</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were Gown-men till this Man made his Fortune, and then as Noble as the King. His Eyes were blew and lively, a handſome Noſe, a great Forehead, a pointed Chin, the form of his Face was flat, his Hair was a bright brown, his ſhape was ordinary, and his meen baſe; his Conduct in the World was quite contrary to his profeſſion, he was active ambitious, and haughty towards People; he did not love, but the moſt ardent and beſt Friend that ever was; he had engaged himſelf in an Amourous Intrigue more out of Pride than out of love; but afterwards Love be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Maſter: The firſt Woman he had made love to was Madam <hi>de Chevrueſe,</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:61590:56"/>
of the Houſe of <hi>Lorraine,</hi> by whom he was entertained with a very great Paſſion, the other was Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> who in the Favours ſhe had granted him, had more conſidered her Intreſts than her Pleaſures: ſhe being one of the moſt Beautyfull and extraordinary Women of <hi>France,</hi> it is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient to make here the Deſcription of her Life.</p>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:61590:58"/>
of the late King, <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth's Father, Wife of <hi>Gaſpard</hi> Duke of <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> had black and lively Eyes, a little Forehead, a handſome Noſe, a red Lip, and full Mouth, her Complexion was as ſhe thought fit, but ſhe had uſually white and red, ſhe was ſo Charming when ſhe ſmiled, that ſhe ſet all hearts on a flame; her Hair was very black, ſhe was tall, had a good Aire, but long, dry, and black hands, her Arms were flat, and of the ſame colour, which made People draw ill Concluſions of thoſe parts they did not ſee: She had a loft and agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Wit, was inſinuating and given to flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, was faithleſs, intereſſed and uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Friendſhip; and yet what Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſoever Men had had of her ill Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, when ſhe had a mind to Charm, it was impoſſible for them to forbear loving her; ſhe had ſome ways with her that were very tempting, and others that made her be deſpiſed by all People; for Money and Honours ſhe would have diſhonoured her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and have ſacrificed Father, Mother, and Lovers.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Gaſpard d' Coligny,</hi> and ſince Duke of <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> after the Death of the Marſhal his Father, and of his eldeſt Brother, fell in Love with Mademoiſelle <hi>de Bouteville;</hi>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:61590:58"/>
and being the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> fell likewiſe in love with her, <hi>Coligny</hi> deſired him to break off his Amour, ſince his Highneſſes deſign was only Gallantry, and he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Marriage. The Prince being <hi>Coligny</hi>'s Relation and Friend, could not civilly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe him his demand; and as his Paſſion was of a very freſh date, he did not find it difficult to get rid of it: He not only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed <hi>Coligny</hi> that he would think of her no more, but that he would ſerve him in this Affair againſt the Marſhal his Father, and his Relations who oppoſed it; and indeed not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the Orders of Parliament, and all the Obſtacles that the Marſhal his Father was able to raiſe againſt it, the Prince aſſiſted <hi>Coligny</hi> ſo well, then of that Name, but ſince the death of his Father called <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillon,</hi> that he made him carry away Made<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moiſelle <hi>de Bouteville,</hi> and lent him Twenty thouſand Francks for his Maintenance. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligny</hi> carried his Miſtreſs to <hi>Chaſteau-Thierry,</hi> where he Conſummated the marriage: From thence they proceeded farther, and went to <hi>Steny,</hi> a Town of Safety, which the Prince, whom it belonged to, had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them, for their abode. Whether that <hi>Coligny</hi> did not find his Miſtreſs ſo full of Charms as he had fancied in her, or that
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:61590:59"/>
Love being ſatisfied, he had time to reflect on the ill Condition his Fortune was in, or that he feared he had given his Wife the Diſeaſe he had, he fell into a terrible Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy on the Morrow after his Marriage: And while he was at <hi>Steny,</hi> his Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continued upon him to that degree, that he was as conſtant to the Woods as a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage. Two or three days after he went to the Army, and his Wife into a Convent of the Religieuſes, two Leagues from <hi>Paris.</hi> It was thither that <hi>Roquelaure,</hi> knowing the Neceſſity ſhe was in, ſent her a Thouſand broad Pieces, and <hi>Vinevil</hi> two thouſand Crowns, which Sums are ſtill owing to them, tho the Dutcheſs is very rich, and that Money was employed to her own uſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Coligny</hi> being under Age when he married his Wife, it rendred his Marriage invalid, but being of Age at his Return, a Contract of Marriage was made in the <hi>Hostel</hi> of <hi>Condé</hi> before all the young Ladies Relations, and they were afterwards married in <hi>Noſtre Dame</hi> by the Coadjutor of <hi>Paris.</hi> Sometime after Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> being indiſpoſed, went to the Wells, where ſhe met with the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> who fell in love with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:61590:59"/>
The Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> had very white Hair, a handſome Noſe, a little Mouth, and of a fine Colour, and was the prettieſt ſhape Man imaginable: The leaſt of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions was attended with an unexpreſſible Grace, his Humour was gay, wanton and toying, and his Will was admirable brisk and quaint. The liberty of ſeeing one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother at all hours, which Cuſtom has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in Places where the Waters are taken, gave a thouſand opportunities to the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> of acquainting his Miſtreſs with his Paſſion: But knowing that an Amorous Intrigue was never better regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, at leaſt with Ladies we have ſome e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem for, than by making a Declaration by word of Mouth or by Writing: He reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to ſpeak; and being one day alone with her at her Lodgings, <q>I have been above three weeks, Madam, ſaid he to her, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering whether I ſhould tell you the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion your Charms have made upon my heart; and when I determined at length to acquaint you with it, it is after having ſeen all the Difficulties that I can find in this Deſign: I do my ſelf Juſtice, Madam, and for that reaſon I ought not to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any hopes. Beſides, you have lately married a beloved Lover, and it is a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:61590:60"/>
Enterprize to remove him out of your heart, and to put my ſelf in his place. However I love you, Madam, and tho you ſhould not to be ungrateful, make uſe of that reaſon againſt me, I confeſs that it is my Star, and not my Choice that obliges me to love you. </q>Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver had had ſo much joy as this Diſcourſe gave her. Monſieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> appeared to her ſo lovely, that if it had been the Cuſtom for Women to have made Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of Love firſt, ſhe would not have deferred it ſo long as her Gallant did. But the fear of not ſeeming modeſt enough per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed her ſo extreamly, that ſhe was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time without knowing what Anſwer to make. At length forcing herſelf to ſpeak for the concealing the diſorder that her ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence made appear; <q>You are in the right my Lord, ſaid ſhe to him, with all imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable poſtures, to believe that I love my Husband very much; but give me leave to tell you, that you do your ſelf wrong in being ſo Modeſt as you are: And if I was in a Condition to acknowledge the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs you have for me, you would ſee that others eſteem you more than you do your ſelf. Ah! Madam, replyed the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> it is in your power, Madam, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:61590:60"/>
only in yours, to make me the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and moſt eſteemed Man in <hi>France.</hi>
                  </q> He had hardly finiſhed theſe words, then that the Counteſs of <hi>Maure</hi> came into the Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, before whom it was requiſite to change Converſation, tho theſe two Lovers did not change their thoughts; Their diſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and diſorder made the Counteſs of <hi>Maure</hi> judge that their Intrigue was much more advanced than it really was, and for this reaſon ſhe was preparing to make a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhort Viſit, when the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> prevented her. The amorous and diſcreet Prince well knowing that he acted but an ill part before ſuch a ſharp-ſighted Woman as the Counteſs of <hi>Maure</hi> was, went out, and being got home, he wrote this Letter to his Miſtreſs.</p>

                     <p>I <hi>Leave you, Madam, that I may be more with you then I was; the Counteſs of</hi> Maure <hi>obſerved me, and I durst not look upon you; and ſhe being cunning, I was even afraid that my Affection would diſcover me; for in ſhort, Madam, it is ſo well known that People muſt eye you when they are in the ſame place, that thoſe that do not are ſuſpected of ſome Deſign.

               <p>Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> was very much per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed at the receipt of this Letter; ſhe knew not whether ſhe had beſt be cruel or kind. Kindneſs might gain the heart of her Lover, and Severity his eſteem, and both might diſguſt him. At length ſhe reſolved to do what was moſt difficult, as being moſt honeſt: And notwithſtanding all that her heart inſpired her with, ſhe choſe rather to follow the counſel of her Reaſon: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe made the Duke no Anſwer; and as he came on the Morrow into her Chamber, <hi>Are you come again my Lord,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>to commit ſome new Offence? becauſe my hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and looks are eaſie and ſoft, you think there is no more to do than falling on: And if your eſteem is only to be purchaſed by rudeneſs, ſet that value on it as to conſtrain my ſelf for ſome time: Yes, my Lord, I ſhall be angry, and I perceive I muſt be ſo with you.</hi> Theſe laſt words were as a Thunder-clap fallen upon this poor Lover; tears came into his Eyes, and his tears ſpoke much better for him
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:61590:61"/>
than all he could have ſaid. After having been a moment without ſpeaking, <q>I am infinitely grieved, Madam, anſwered he her, to ſee you thus in anger; and I wiſh I was dead ſince I have diſpleaſed you. You ſhall ſee, Madam, that in the Vengeance I am reſolved to take of the offence you have received, that your intereſts are much more dear to me than my own; I am going ſo far from you, Madam, that my Love ſhall no longer importune you. This is not what I require of you, interrupted that fair One, you may ſtill ſtay here, without diſpleaſing me. Cannot you ſee me without telling me you love me, or at leaſt without writing me it? No, no, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, replyed he, it is abſolutely impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Well then, my Lord, I conſent that you ſee me, replyed Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon;</hi> but obſerve well all that I do for you. Ah! Madam, interrupted the Duke, throwing himſelf at her feet, if I have adored you when you were ſo cruel, judge what I ſhall do when you are kind: Yes, Madam, be pleaſed to gueſs at it, for it is impoſſible for me to expreſs the ſenſe I have of it.</q> This Converſation did not end as it began: Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> diſpenſed herſelf from keeping all the rigour ſhe had promiſed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

and if the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> had not great Favours, at leaſt he had hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beloved. In confidence of this he was no ſooner got home, then that he wrote this Letter to his Miſtreſs.</p>

<pb n="115" facs="tcp:61590:62"/>
with ſuch a joy, as put him almoſt out of himſelf, he kiſſed it a thouſand times, not being able to forbear reading of it. In the mean time the Paſſion of theſe two Lovers augmented every day; and Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> who had already yielded up her heart, no longer defended the reſt, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to render it the more conſiderable by the difficulty. In ſhort, the time of taking the Waters being paſſed, they were to part, and tho they both returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> they both imagined they ſhould not ſee one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again with ſo much Conveniency as they had done at <hi>Bourbon:</hi> In the view of theſe Difficulties their Farewel was very moving! The Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> aſſured his Miſtreſs more by his tears that he ſhould ever love her, than by the things he ſaid to her; and the conſtraint that Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> uſed not to weep, had the ſame ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in her Lover: They parted very ſad, but deeply perſwaded that they would love one another paſſionately, &amp; that they ſhould ever do ſo. They ſeldom met the reſt of the Autumn, becauſe they were obſerved; but Letters paſſed often between them.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of Winter, the Civil War which begun to break forth, obliged the King to leave <hi>Paris</hi> ſomething ſurprize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:61590:63"/>
and retire to St. <hi>Germains.</hi> At that time, the Marſhal, <hi>Coligny</hi>'s Father, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to dye, and the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who was then the Cardinal of <hi>Mazarine</hi>'s right Arm, obtained the Patent of Duke and Peer for his Coſin <hi>de Coligny.</hi> The Troops coming from all parts, the City was blocked up; the Court however did not ſeem very ſad, and the Courtiers and Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were over-joyed at the ill poſture of Affairs; the Cardinal only, whom they might ruin, concealed part of them from the Queen, and all from the young King, whom when they talked to of War, it was only to acquaint him with the defeats of the Enemies, and the reſt of the time they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſed him in Plays that were ſutable to his Age: Amongſt other Perſons with whom he loved to play, the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chaſtillon</hi> held the firſt rank; and hereupon <hi>Benſcrade</hi> made this Sonnet under her Husband's Name.</p>

               <p>In theſe little Playes the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> did not loſe his time, they ever fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the Dutcheſs and him with occaſions of giving one another teſtimonies of their love; and by the ſame degrees that the paſſion of theſe two Lovers augmented, their prudence did the Contrary: it was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that at a Play called the <hi>Bohemien</hi> they placed themſelves oppoſite to one another, and were always whiſpering, and that when one was blind-folded, the other ſtood ſo as to be caught; to the end that the hand in ſeeking to know who it was that was taken might have a pretext to feel every where: In ſhort there was not one of theſe Plays but what furniſhed them with the means of tickling their amourous fancy.</p>
               <p>The Duke of <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> whom the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Wife's humour obliged to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her, ſaw ſomething of an Intrigue between the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> and her; Glory more than Love made him receive this diſcovery with an extreame Impatience. He ſpoke of it to one of his beſt Friends, who ſharing his grief as deeply as poſſible, went and told the Dutcheſs of it. <hi>The</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:61590:64"/>
                  <hi>ſervice that I have devoted, ſaid he, to the Family of his Grace your Husband, obliges me to come and give you an advice which is of Conſequence. Beautyfull as you are, Madam, it is impoſſible but that you muſt have adorers, and as certainly your intentions being good, you have not ſo ſtrict a raine over your own actions; moſt Women who envy you, and Men jealous of the Glory of the Duke your Husband, give an ill interpretation to all you do. My Lord your Husband, himſelf has perceived that your Conduct, which tho it were more imprudent than Criminal, does not faile however to do you an injury in the World, and trouble him: you know how haughty he is, Madam, and how much he would fear to be ridiculed upon that point: I give you notice of it, and humbly beſeech you to take care; for if by relying too much upon the clearneſs of your Conſcience, you ſhould be too negligent of your Reputation, his Grace may come to ſuch Violences againſt you, as would not leave you in a Condition to make appear to him your innocence. What you tell me, Sir,</hi> anſwered Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon, ought not to ſurprize me; my Lord Duke began be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to accustom me to his Caprichio's: On the day after our Wedding, he fell into ſo furious a jealouſy of</hi> Roquelaure, <hi>who had helped him to carry me away, that he could not conceal it;</hi>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:61590:64"/>
                  <hi>and yet he could never have had leſs reaſon than at what he gave him; and now again I find that he renews his ſuſpicions, and yet I cannot devine of whom it is: All that I can ſay is, that I doubt whether his mind would be at reſt, tho I were in the Countrey and ſaw none but my Domeſticks. I ſhall not come to further parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars with you, Madam. I even know not whether my Lord Duke aimes at any one, when he tells me he is ſatisfied with you; but you may upon what I have told you take meaſures for your Conduct.</hi> And thereupon having taken leave of her, he left her under terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſquiets. She immediately gave notice of all this to the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> and they reſolved together that they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain themſelves more than they had thitherto done.</p>
               <p>In the mean time the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> was wholly taken up in Contriving how to reduce the People of <hi>Paris</hi> by Famine, to deliver the Parliament, that had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed a ſum to thoſe who would bring the Cardinals Head, fancyed that the taking of <hi>Charenton</hi> would much advance this Succeſs, which <hi>Clanle</hi> guarded with five or ſix hundred Men: he reaſſembled part of the Quarters, and with a thouſand Men, at the head of whom <hi>Gaſton</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:61590:65"/>
King's Unkle, and Lieutenant General of the Regency, would needs place himſelf, he came to Attack <hi>Charenton</hi> in three places. As the Retrenchments at the <hi>Avenues</hi> were but bad, it was not difficult for the King's Troops to force them. But the Duke of <hi>Chastillon,</hi> who commanded the Attacks under the Prince was wounded in the belly with a Musket ſhot in the Burrough, of which he dyed the Night after. The Prince regretted him extreamly, and his grief was ſo violent that it could not laſt. By what had paſſed you may judge that the Dutcheſſes Affliction was not very great, and you may judge it much better by what ſhall happen in the ſequel; however ſhe wept, ſhe tore her Hair, and made appear the Appearances of the greateſt Deſpair i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable, the Publick was ſo deceived, that this Sonnet was made upon his death.</p>

               <p>The Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> who was better informed than the reſt of the World, was not aſtoniſhed at Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi>'s af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction: He timed his buſineſs ſo well, that the exceſs of grief had altered in that poor deſpairing fair One, and was ſo earneſt with her to grant him Enjoyment, that the fear ſhe had had of her Husband, had hindred her from allowing him during his life, that ſhe made an Aſſignation with him on the day of his Burial. <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> one of her Women, who ſancied that the Duke's death would ruin the Fortune of <hi>Ricoux,</hi> who ſought her in Marriage, was under a real Affliction; inſomuch that when ſhe ſaw the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> upon the point of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the leaſt Favours from her Miſtreſs, on a day that the moſt diſſolute conſtrain themſelves, the horrour of this action re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubled her grief, and without going out of the Chamber, ſhe diſturbed the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:61590:66"/>
of thoſe Lovers by her ſighs and by her tears. The Duke well-ſeeing that if he did not appeaſe this Woman, he ſhould not have for the future in his Amour all the ſweetneſs that he wiſhed for, took care to comfort her, at his going out, and told her that he was ſenſible of the loſs ſhe had of the Duke; but that he would be a Friend to her, and take care of her Fortune as the deceaſed had done; and that ſhe ſhould find as much good will in him as ſhe had done in the other, and perhaps more power; and that till he could do ſomething conſiderable for her, he deſired her to receive Four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns that he would ſend her on the morrow. Theſe words had ſo much virtue that <hi>Bordeaux</hi> wiped away her tears, and promiſed the Duke to entereſſe herſelf for him as long as ſhe lived; and told him that her Miſtreſs had all the reaſon in the World not to ſpare any thing for the giving him marks of her Love. On the Morrow <hi>Bordeaux</hi> had the Four thouſand Crowns which the Duke had promiſed her, and ſince that time ſhe ſerved him preferably to all thoſe who would not give her ſo much.</p>
               <p>The Peace being made, in the beginning of the Spring, the Court returned to <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris.</hi> The Prince, who had newly freed the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:61590:66"/>
Cardinal out of a dangerous buſineſs, ſold him his Services at a very dear rate, that he had done him in that War. The Cardinal was not only unable to perform what he daily demanded of him; but was not able to ſupport the Inſolence with which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Favours: The Government of <hi>Pont de Letreht,</hi> that the Prince had forced from him for his Brother in Law the Duke of <hi>Longueville,</hi> contrary to the intention of the Court, and the boldneſs with which he had exacted from the Queen that ſhe ſhould ſee <hi>Gerſé,</hi> after the confidence he had had to write an Amorous Ticket to her Majeſty, made the Cardinal at length reſolve to free himſelf from the tyranny he was under, under pretext of revenging the Contempt that was had of the Royal Authority; he communicated this Deſign to the Duke of <hi>Orleans,</hi> who remembred his Exempt's bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Staff by the Prince, and who for that and the jealouſie of his great Merit, had reaſons to hate him; and the Cardinal let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him know that <hi>Riviere,</hi> who governed him, was the Prince's Penſioner, he made him give his word that he would conceal this Affair from his Favourite. The Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Longueville</hi> their Brother in Law, were
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:61590:67"/>
took into Cuſtody in the Palace where the King then lodged: In the mean time Monſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eur <hi>Thurenne,</hi> who for the Engagements he had with the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> had reaſon to fear being taken, and who beſides was enraged againſt the Court for the Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of <hi>Sedan,</hi> which his Family was depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of, withdrew to <hi>Sthney,</hi> where Madam <hi>de Longueville</hi> arrived preſently after, and the Prince's Officers caſt themſelves into <hi>Bellegarde;</hi> Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> applyed herſelf to the Princeſs Dowager, and enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> her Lover in her Intereſts.</p>
               <p>Sometime after that the Princes were in Priſon. The Princeſs Dowager had leave to go ſtay at her Coſins Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi>'s. A Prieſt called <hi>Cambiac,</hi> who had intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced himſelf to Madam <hi>de Bouteville</hi>'s, by the means of Madam <hi>Brienne,</hi> was ſent to Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> by her Mother; he had not been there long, but that he governed her, inſomuch that he interpoſed between her and the Duke of <hi>Nemours.</hi> This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce giving him occaſion of having great Familiarities with Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> he fell in love with her, and to that degree, as to ſaint away as he was ſaying Maſs. The Princeſs Dowager falling into that fit of
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:61590:67"/>
Sickneſs, which ſhe died of, <hi>Cambiac,</hi> who had acquired great Credit with her, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed it in favour of Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon:</hi> He procured her a hundred thouſand Crowns worth of Jewels, and the Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of <hi>Marlou</hi> for her life, which was worth two thouſand pounds a year. The Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> whom the cares of <hi>Cambiac</hi> for Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> had ſomething a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm'd, was quite jealous at the News of the Princeſſes Will. He did not believe that it was eaſie to reſiſt ſuch conſiderable Service; and though he could not blame his Miſtreſs for having received them, he was enraged that ſhe was obliged for them to a Man whom he conſidered as his Rival. And he was not miſtaken; for what <hi>Cambiac</hi> had done had coſt that fair One Favours; for though ſhe loved the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> beſt, ſhe loved Riches beſt of all. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as ſhe had no longer occaſion for <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biac</hi> after the Princeſſes death, it was not difficult for her to ſet her Lovers mind at reſt, by turning off that poor Prieſt.</p>
               <p>The Coadjutour of <hi>Paris,</hi> and Madam <hi>de Chevreuſe,</hi> who had been in the Plot of ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Princeſs, finding that the Cardinal became too inſolent, cauſed the Duke of <hi>Orleans</hi> to take it into conſideration, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:61590:68"/>
to him that if he contributed to the Liberty of the Princeſs, he would not only be reconciled with them, but would engage them altogether in his Intereſts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the deſign of weakning the Cardinal's Authority, which gave ombrage to the Party called <hi>la Fronde,</hi> every one had ſtill his particular Intereſt. Madam <hi>de Chevreuſe</hi> would have had the Prince of <hi>Conty,</hi> for whom the Court had demanded a Cardinals Cap at <hi>Rome,</hi> to have married her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the Coadjutour would be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogated to the nomination of the Prince. It was upon this promiſe that the Princeſs of <hi>Condé</hi> and <hi>Conty</hi> gave under their hands to Madam <hi>de Chevreuſe,</hi> that ſhe and the Coadjutour endeavoured to free them out of Priſon. The thing having ſucceeded as they had projected; and the Cardinal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf having been conſtrained to leave <hi>France,</hi> the Prince had no moderation in his new Proſperity, and this obliged the Court to entertain new Deſignes upon his Perſon. He withdrew immediately to his Houſe at <hi>Saint Maure,</hi> and ſometime after to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rond,</hi> and from thence to his Government of <hi>Guyenne.</hi> The Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, and Madam <hi>de Longueville,</hi> who was with her Brother, being taken with his
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:61590:68"/>
Merit, had ſo much Complaiſance for him, that this Prince, tho very much in love elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, could not reſiſt her; but yielded through the weakneſs of the Fleſh, rather than the inclination of the heart. The Duke of <hi>Rochefoucault,</hi> who had been for three years the beloved Gallant of Madam <hi>de Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueville,</hi> ſaw the Infidelity of his Miſtreſs with all the rage that can be had in ſuch like Occaſions. But ſhe being full of a great Paſſion for the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> was not at all careful to pleaſe her ancient Lover. The firſt time that ſhe ſaw the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi> in private, ſhe asked him in the moſt paſſionate moment of the Aſſignation, what had paſſed between him and Madam <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillon:</hi> The Duke having anſwered her that he had not had any Favour: <hi>Ah! I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>ſince in the Poſture we are in at preſent, you have the power to conceal the truth.</hi> This Commerce did not laſt long, and the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> not being able to force himſelf to pretend love where he had none; and you may imagine that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, who was naſty, and had an ill ſmell with her, could not conceal her ill Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from a Man, who was infinitely in love elſewhere. Theſe Diſguſts did likewiſe further the Journey that the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours</hi>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:61590:69"/>
was to make into <hi>Flanders,</hi> to bring a Succour of Strangers to the Princes Party: But the real cauſe of his impatience was, to ſee Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> again, whom he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver loved more than his life; whereupon he paſſed through <hi>Paris,</hi> where he ſaw her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and put her into that wretched Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that may be called the Shipwrack of Widows. When ſhe perceived her misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, ſhe ſought for the means to be freed from it. <hi>Des Fougerets,</hi> a famous Phyſician, undertook this Cure, and while he had her in hand, the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> returned from <hi>Guyenne</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> and brought <hi>la Rochefou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cault</hi> with him.</p>
               <p>The Prince had lively Eyes, a Hawks and ſharp Noſe, hollow lean Cheeks, a long Face, and the Phyſiognomy of an Eagle, frizled Hair, his Teeth were ill ſet and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, a careleſs Aire, had but little care of his Perſon, but was well ſhaped; his Wit had a great deal of flame, but was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, he laughed much and diſagreably, his <hi>Genius</hi> was admirable for War, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for Battails. On the day of Battail he was mild to Friends, and fierce to Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: He had an unparallel'd neatneſs of Wit, force of Judgment, and eaſineſs of Expreſſion; he was Roguiſhly inclined, but
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:61590:69"/>
had Faith and Probity in great Occaſions: He was naturally inſolent and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, but Adverſity had taught him how to live. This Prince finding himſelf diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to fall in love with the Dutcheſs, <hi>La Rochefoucault</hi> helped ſtill to inflame him by the great deſire he had of being revenged on the Duke of <hi>Nemours. Rochfoucault</hi> perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him to give her the Propriety of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lou,</hi> which ſhe had only the uſu-fruit of, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him that Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> was youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than he, and that this Preſent would only injure his Poſterity; and that a Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of two thouſand pounds a year, more or leſs, would neither render him richer nor poorer.</p>
               <p>When the Prince fell in love with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> ſhe was in the hands of <hi>Des Fougoreſts,</hi> who made uſe of Vomits to free her of thoſe ill Circumſtances. The Prince, who was continually at her Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, asked her what her Sickneſs was; ſhe told him that ſhe believed ſhe was poyſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This Lover being extreamly grieved to ſee his Miſtreſs in danger of her life, told the Apothecary, who ſerved her, that he would cauſe him to be hanged: This poor man not daring to juſtifie himſelf, went and told <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> who was married to <hi>Ricoux,</hi>
                  <pb n="130" facs="tcp:61590:70"/>
that if he was preſſed too much, he would tell all. In ſhort, the Remedies had the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect that they had promiſed themſelves: And ſhortly after this Cure, the Prince having given her <hi>Marlou,</hi> Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> was not ungrateful, but ſhe only gave him the uſu-fruit of what the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> had the Propriety. However, <hi>Rochefoucault</hi> took full Vengeance of the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,</hi> and gave him diſpleaſures by ſo much the more cutting, that he had not the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to cure himſelf of his Paſſion, as <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foucault</hi> had done of that he had had for Madam <hi>de Longueville.</hi> Beſides <hi>Rochefou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cault, Vinevil</hi> was likewiſe the Prince's Confident, who in ſerving him with his Miſtreſs, endeavoured likewiſe to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved himſelf. <hi>Vinevil</hi> was the Preſident <hi>d' Ardiers</hi> Brother, of a pretty good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in <hi>Paris,</hi> had a pleaſing Face, much Learning, and was a well-bred man: His Humour was pleaſant and Satyrical, tho very fearful; this had often brought him into trouble; he was undertaking with Women, and that made him almoſt always ſucceſsful, he had had an Intrigue with Madam <hi>de Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bazon,</hi> Madam <hi>de Movy,</hi> and likewiſe with the Princeſs of <hi>Wittembergh:</hi> And this laſt Gallantry had ſo embroiled him, with the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:61590:70"/>
late Duke of <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> that without the Prince's protection he would have ſuffered ſome Violences, and <hi>Chaſtillons</hi> hatred for him, had ſufficiently diſpoſed his Wife to love him. But let us leave <hi>Vinevil</hi> for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, and return to the Duke of <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Jealouſie ſo tranſported him, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving one day found the Prince at Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi>'s whiſpering with her, he all ſcratched his hands without perceiving what he did; and it was one of his Servants who made him take notice of the Condition he had put himſelf in. At length, not being able to ſuffer the Prince's Viſits to his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs, he deſired her to go for ſome time to her Country Houſe. She loving him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly, and not thinking that a ſhort ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence would cool the Prince's Paſſion, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him his requeſt; and likewiſe promiſed him to turn off <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> who had quitted his Intereſts for to be for thoſe of his Rival. Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> was not long in the Country; and at her Return, the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> was jealous to that degree, that he was twenty times upon the point of cauſing the Prince to draw; and he would at length have been overcome with this Temptation, had it not been for the Duel he fought with
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:61590:71"/>
his Brother in Law, in which he loſt his Life.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> who of twenty Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſhe had favoured in her life time, had never loved any ſo much as the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> was really grieved for his death. One of her Friends, who brought her the News of it, told her at the ſame time, that it was requiſite that ſhe ſhould get out of one of Monſieur <hi>de Nemours</hi> his <hi>Valet de Chamber</hi>'s hands, a Cabinet full of her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. She ſent for him, and upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe ſhe made him of giving him five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Crowns, ſhe got the Cabinet from him, but the poor Fellow could never get any of the Money.</p>
               <p>As for the Prince, what obligation ſoever he had to the Duke of <hi>Nemours,</hi> jealouſie had ſo diſunited them, that he was very glad of his death. Glory as well as Love had cauſed ſo much Emulation between them, that they could not bear with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother; and this is ſo true, that if the Prince had had a mind to have taken all the Precautions neceſſary to hinder the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> from fighting, he might have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the Duel. One thing more which made appear that there was more of Glory than of Love in the Prince's Heart, was that
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:61590:71"/>
a moment after the death of his Rival, he hardly loved Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and contented himſelf with keeping meaſures of Civility with her, to make uſe of her upon occaſion, and when he ſhould think convenient.</p>
               <p>And indeed at that time, the Cardinal thinking that ſhe governed the Prince, ſent the Great Provoſt of <hi>France</hi> to her, to offer her from him an hundred thouſand Crowns ready Money, and the Place of Superin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of the future Queens Family, in caſe ſhe would oblige the Prince to grant the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles he deſired, and abandon the Count <hi>d' Oignon,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Rochefoucault,</hi> and Preſident <hi>Viole.</hi> During the Negotiation of the Grand Provoſt, an Officer of the Guards, called <hi>Mouchette,</hi> negotiated like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe on the Queens part with Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon;</hi> but ſhe, ſeeing that ſhe could not perſwade the Prince to do the things that the Count deſired, ſent the Queen word that ſhe counſelled her to grant the Prince all that he ſhould deſire of her, and that afterwards her Majeſty would know well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough how to deal with a Subject, who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king advantage of the diſorder of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of his Maſter; had forced from her ſhameful Conditions, and ſuch as were
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:61590:72"/>
prejudicial to her Authority.</p>
               <p>At that time, the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> having been taken by the Enemies, was brought to the Palace of <hi>Condé;</hi> he had a very ſharp Converſation with the Prince, but on the morrow things began to cool, and ſome days after the Treaty of Peace was renewed with him. As he was a Priſoner upon pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rol, and that he went every where he had a mind to, he made ſome Viſits to Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> believing that nothing could be done with the Prince but by her interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and it was in thoſe Viſits that he fell in love with her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vinevil</hi> governed then Madam <hi>de Chaſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> pretty peaceably; <hi>Cambiac</hi> was retired ſince that the Prince was in love, and that the Duke of <hi>Nemours</hi> was dead, and this had very much diminiſhed the Prince's Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; inſomuch that ſome days after having been conſtrained to retire into <hi>Flanders</hi> by the accommodation of <hi>Paris,</hi> he was upon the point of departing without taking leave of Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> and when at length he went to ſee her, he was but a moment with her.</p>
               <p>The King being returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> fancied that if Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> ſtayed there, he ſhould have Rivals
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:61590:72"/>
upon his back, who might be preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; inſomuch that he perſwaded the Cardinal to ſend her away, ſaying that ſhe would every day ſet on foot a thouſand In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues againſt the Intereſts of the Court, which ſhe could not do elſewhere; and this obliged the Cardinal to ſend her to <hi>Marlou:</hi> The Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> went thither as often as he could; but there were in her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood two men who made her yet more frequent Viſits; The one was my Lord <hi>Crofts</hi> an Engliſhman who had hired a Houſe near <hi>Marlou,</hi> where he uſually kept his Equipage, and where he came to ly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and the other was <hi>Digby</hi> Earl of <hi>Briſtol,</hi> Governour of the <hi>Iſle of Man:</hi> Theſe two Noble men fell in love with the Dutcheſs; <hi>Crofts</hi> was a peacable Man and addicted to Pleaſures, and <hi>Briſtol</hi> was haughtly, brave and full of ambition,</p>
               <p>When that <hi>Cambiac</hi> had ſeen the Prince go out of <hi>France,</hi> he had made his appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon;</hi> inſomuch that he ſtayed with her at <hi>Marlou;</hi> and as he was not ſo much afraid of the Abbot <hi>Foucquet</hi> or of <hi>Bristol,</hi> as of the Prince, he freely told Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of her carriage with all her Lovers. She, not being willing to be contradicted
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:61590:73"/>
in her new deſigns, and particularly by a Party concerned, took his Remonſtrances very ill; inſomuch that things growing daily worſe and worſe between them, <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biac</hi> at length retired grumbling, and as a Man that ought to be ſeared. Sometime after he wrote a Letter without a Name, and with a forged Hand, in which he gave her notice of the ill they talked of her in the World. She ſuſpected however that this Letter came from him, becauſe he ſent her word of things, that no body but ſhe could know of. At length Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> learning from ſeveral parts that <hi>Cambiac</hi> railed againſt her, ſhe deſired madam <hi>Piſieux,</hi> whom ſhe was very well acquainted with, and who had a power over him, to withdraw ſome Letters of Conſequence that he had of hers, which Madam <hi>de Piſieux</hi> promiſed her to do, and at the ſame time ſent word to <hi>Cambiac</hi> to come to her at her Houſe at <hi>Marins</hi> near <hi>Pontoiſe.</hi> It is to be obſerved that ſince that <hi>Cambiac</hi> was gone from Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> ſhe had made a thouſand Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints againſt him to my Lord <hi>Digby.</hi> This Lover, who only thought of pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Miſtreſs, and who ruined himſelf in expences for her ſake, did not ſtick at
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:61590:73"/>
promiſing her a Vengance that ſhould coſt him nothing, and wherein he would find his particular intereſt: He took the time that <hi>Cambiac</hi> being at <hi>Marine,</hi> was one day on Horſeback to go abroad, and having ſeized him with five or ſix Troopers, he ſent him to <hi>Marlou.</hi> Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> knowing that Lovers that had been well treated ought never to be offended by halves, was much perplexed at the manner that <hi>Cambiac</hi> was now uſed, and perceived that no Body would be ſuspected but her; ſhe was very ill ſatisfied with <hi>Digby,</hi> and would have ſooner pardoned him the Death of <hi>Cambiac</hi> than the ſeizing him after this manner: But in ſhort, not being able to undo what was done. <hi>I am extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly grieved,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>at what has now happened to you, I perceive that the Impertinent who has done you this Affront, would make you ſuſpect me, by ſending you to my Houſe; but you ſhall ſee by the reſentment I ſhall have of it, that I have no ſhare in this Voilence; In the mean time, Sir, if you have a mind to ſtay here, you are Maſter; if you think fit to return to</hi> Marine, <hi>you ſhall have my Coach, you need only Command it. I know, Madam,</hi> anſwered <hi>Cambiac</hi> to her coolly, <hi>what I ought to think of all this, I give you</hi>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:61590:74"/>
                  <hi>thanks for the offers you make me; I ſhall return on Horſeback if you think fit: God, who will defend me from the attempts of the wicked, will have care of me to the end.</hi> And having ſpoke theſe words he went away in a pett, and returned alone to <hi>Marine.</hi> He was no ſooner arrived there than that he and Madam <hi>de Piſieux</hi> wrote theſe two Letters to one of their Friends at <hi>Paris.</hi>

Madam</hi> de Piſieux, <hi>as you know, wrote to me; and you likewiſe know that I undertook the journey the ſame day that I arrived; Madam</hi> de Chaſtillon <hi>ſent</hi> la Fleur, <hi>to know if I was here, and on the Morrow a Man unknown under falſe Colours, came to ask me, and know if I would return ſeddenly to</hi> Paris. <hi>Yeſterday I departed from bence at four a Clock; being an hundred Paces</hi>

                        <hi>from</hi> Pontois, <hi>after having paſſed the River, I was inveſted by ſix Horſmen, with their Swords in their hands, at the head of whom was my Lord</hi> Digby. <hi>He told me immediately, that if Madam</hi> de Chaſtillon <hi>would have done me juſtice, ſhe ſhould have cauſed me to receive a hundred ſtabs, but that I ſhould fear No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. I ſhall tell you without any Bravado, that I acted very briskly in this encounter, and that I did nothing in this Affaire that was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy; he uſed me very civilly, and after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving dined, be conducted me himſelf to the foot of</hi> Marlou, <hi>and then ſent me with four Horſmen to make ſatisfaction to that worthy perſon; ſhe ſeemed to be diſpleaſed at this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and was really ſo at the haughtineſs with which I ſpoke to her, which made her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend that it was the worſt thing ſhe had ever done.

She has all the reſentment that a perſon of her Qualisy, Honour and Courage ought to have.

Oblige me with imparting this to Monſieur</hi> de Aubigny, <hi>and to no others: This will be no ill Entertainment for the Princeſs</hi> Palatine, <hi>which I give you leave to tell it to. I do not believe that</hi> Cambiac<hi>'s Crime of returning to his Duty, by the means of the Biſhop of</hi> Ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, <hi>nor mine for having concealed him, were great enough to occaſion ſo ill an Accident. I ſhall come on purpoſe to</hi> Paris <hi>to diſcourſe my Friends in particular, and you in the firſt place. I cannot hold in this little word of Revenge, Madam</hi> de Chaſtillon <hi>is not forgotten when an occaſion is offered to ſpeak of her: I wiſh you happineſs, I am too angry to have any to day.</hi>

In a ſhort time after theſe two Letters were ſent, <hi>Cambiac</hi> returned to <hi>Paris,</hi> and no longer kept any meaſures with Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon;</hi> he railed at her in all Companies, and that he might fully glut his Vengeance, he ſnowed the Queen all the moſt extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly paſſionate Letters of Madam <hi>de Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillon,</hi> the modeſty of the Hiſtory does not permit them to be repeated; but by the moſt civil Fragment we follow, the reſt may be judged of.</p>
               <p>In ſeveral parts ſhe let <hi>Cambiac</hi> know, that he might talk of her as he pleaſed, but that it was more generous in him to ſpeak well of her than otherwiſe; that when a Woman lay at the mercy of People, as ſhe did at his, they might make an ill uſe of the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and that what a poor Woman had to do in thoſe Encounters, was to ſuffer and to be ſilent. In another place ſhe let him know, that notwithſtanding all ſhe did, ſhe ſtill loved him, and that though ſhe was preparing to make a general Confeſſion at <hi>Eaſter,</hi> there was nothing therein which concerned him.</p>
               <p>The Queen was much ſurprized at Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi>'s Extravagancy in her Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, however ſhe was not ſorry at the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it brought upon her; and when that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:61590:76"/>
ſhe had learnt the Inſult that had been done to <hi>Cambiac,</hi> ſhe made a great noiſe of it, and ſaid publickly, That ſince People were ſo ill treated, who returned to do their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the King would know how to do them juſtice.</p>
               <p>When my Lord <hi>Digby</hi> came to ſee Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> after what had been done to <hi>Cambiac,</hi> he was aſtoniſhed that he only received reproaches from her, inſtead of the thanks that he expected. <hi>When I let you know,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>my being diſpleaſed with</hi> Cambiac, <hi>it was not meant that you ſhould uſe him as you did: And it is eaſie to ſee that in this fine Action you conſidered your ſelf more than you did me; but I ſhall now be careful of my Intereſts, and neglect yours. Digby</hi> would have excuſed himſelf upon his Intentions, that had been good, and ſeeing that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all that he ſaid to her ſhe was not pacified, he likewiſe fell into a pet; and Madam <hi>de Chastillan</hi> fearing by loſing him to loſe a Protectour and a Lover, ſoothed him up, and deſired him to conſider at another time, that he ought to ruin quite, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble Injuries with ſuch people as <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biac.</hi>

               <p>

While that <hi>Digby</hi> began to fall in love with Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> my Lord <hi>Crofts,</hi> who in the time the Diſorders of <hi>England,</hi> had followed <hi>Charles</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> had taken a Houſe in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Marlou;</hi> and leiſure, conveniency, and the inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ways of Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed this Lord's heart with love; but as he was of a milder diſpoſition than the Earl, his Paſſion had not made ſuch progreſs as the Earl of <hi>Briſtol</hi>'s.</p>
               <p>Things were in theſe terms, when that the Abbot <hi>Foucquett,</hi> ſeeing that his Affairs did not advance with Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> made uſe of this Stratagem to haſtem them: He had learnt that <hi>Ricoux,</hi> Brother in Law to one of Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi>'s Women, was concealed in <hi>Paris,</hi> where he had Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with them for the Prince's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts; he ſent ſo many People in queſt of <hi>Ricoux,</hi> that he was taken and carried to the <hi>Baſtille.</hi> The Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> having cauſed him to be examined, he accuſed Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> of ſeveral things; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt others, of having promiſed him ten thouſand Crowns to kill the Cardinal, and ſaid that ſhe had already given him two thouſand beforehand upon that account. The Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> ſuppreſſed theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:61590:77"/>
and cauſed others to be given, by which <hi>Ricoux</hi> ſtill confeſſed that he was at <hi>Paris</hi> with deſign to kill the Cardinal; but did not accuſe the Ducheſs of having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hand in this Conſpiracy: And all that he ſaid againſt her was, That ſhe kept Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence with the Prince, and received a Penſion of Four thouſand Crowns from the Spaniards. He ſhewed theſe laſt Informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Cardinal, and the firſt to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> by which having, as may be imagined, extreamly terrified her, He told her he would ſave her, if out of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment ſhe would give him the leaſt marks of Love: Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> who feared death more then all things, did not ſtick to ſatisfie the Abbot <hi>Foucquett,</hi> but reſiſted juſt as long as was neceſſary to make him value this laſt Favour. The Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> his whole thoughts were now, how to love his Miſtreſs; and to that end he cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed her to leave <hi>Marlou</hi> one night, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her into <hi>Normandy,</hi> where he made her change her Abode every day, diſguiſed ſometimes like a Gentleman, ſometimes like a Religious, and ſometimes like a Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. This laſted ſix Weeks, during which the Abbot <hi>Foucquet</hi> went and came from Court to the place where Madam <hi>de Chaſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi>
                  <pb n="146" facs="tcp:61590:78"/>
was: At length he procured her an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, when <hi>Ricoux</hi> had been Executed, and cauſed her to return to <hi>Marlou,</hi> where ſhe was not long in repoſe; for ſhe caſt her Eyes upon the Mareſhal <hi>d' Hocquincourt,</hi> as well for the Advantages ſhe might draw from him by the Poſts he held upon the <hi>Somme,</hi> as to free her from the tyranny of the Abbot <hi>Foucquett,</hi> who began to become inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to her.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> Marſhal <hi>d' Hocquincourt</hi> had black ſparkling Eyes, a handſome Noſe, a little Forehead, a long Viſage, and black frized Hair, and his Shape was very fine: He had but little Wit, and yet was cunning by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very diſtruſtful; he was brave and ever in love, and his Valour ſerved him inſtead of Wit and good Carriage amongſt the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> knowing him by Reputation, fancied that he was a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Perſon to commit the Follies ſhe had occaſion for. Monſieur <hi>de Vignacourt,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Picardy,</hi> her Neighbour, was the Perſon ſhe employed to him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Marſhal having agreed with <hi>Vigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> that at his going to Command the Army of <hi>Catalonia,</hi> he would ſee her as he paſſed thorow <hi>Marlou,</hi> as if Chance had occaſioned this Interview. The thing hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:61590:78"/>
as it had been projected, and Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> took Horſe to go to Conduct the Marſhal two Leagues from <hi>Marlou.</hi> On the way, ſhe related to him the ſad Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of her Fortune, deſired him to be her Protectour, flattered him with the Title of the Refuge of the Afflicted, and the Reſource of the Miſerable. In ſhort, ſhe ſo inſpired him with Generoſity, that he promiſed to ſerve her with and againſt all, and even gave her his Table-Book, in which he gave order to the Governours of Towns and Places to receive her and hers, as often as ſhe had occaſion. This Interview was diſcovered by the Abbot <hi>Foucquett,</hi> who ſeeing the Marſhal <hi>d' Hocquincourt</hi> upon the point of returning to Court, judging his and Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi>'s Neighbourhood dangerous for his and the Courts Intereſts, perſwaded the Cardinal to remove her to the Frontiers of <hi>Picardy,</hi> and cauſed an Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be ſent her to go to her Dutchy. As Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> was on her Journey, ſhe met with the Marſhal <hi>d' Hocqiuncourt</hi> at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarquis,</hi> with whom ſhe renewed the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſhe had taken ſix Months before, and after having mutually given one another, he poſitively words to protect her againſt the Court, and ſhe hopes to grant him one day
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:61590:79"/>
marks of her Paſſion. They parted, The Marſhal went to find out the King, and ſhe to her Dutchy, where ſhe paſſed the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, during which the Marſhal <hi>d' Hocquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,</hi> and the Abbot <hi>Foucquett,</hi> who being the moſt difficult Patron to be ſatisfied, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiently ſupported the Interviews that paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between the Marſhal <hi>d' Hocquincourt</hi> and Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> and the Commerce ſhe kept with him. To excuſe herſelf, ſhe told him that the Marſhal uſed his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours with the Cardinal that ſhe might have <hi>Bordeaux</hi> again, who was taken from her, and to obtain of him for herſelf, leave to return to Court: She added, That ſhe could have wiſhed ſhe might not have been indebt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for thoſe Favours to any other than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but that ſhe was willing to ſpare his Credit for Affairs of greater moment. What perſwaded the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue between the Marſhal did only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Court, was that in the Spring ſhe returned through his Interceſſion, firſt to <hi>Marlou,</hi> afterwards to <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Bordeaux</hi> with her. During the Mareſhal's Campaign in <hi>Catalonia,</hi> the King of <hi>England,</hi> whom the misfortunes of his Family obliged to ſtay in <hi>France,</hi> and who had found the Dutcheſs much to his mind, ſaw her at <hi>Marlou</hi> in the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:61590:79"/>
little Journeys he made to my Lord <hi>Crofts</hi>'s his Houſe; and this Commerce had inſpired this Prince with ſo much love for her, that he reſolved to marry her: <hi>Crofts</hi> perſwading his Maſter to ſatisfie her at any rate, upon the promiſes that Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> had given this Lord that he ſhould enjoy her, in caſe he would contribute to the making her Queen: And indeed ſhe had been ſo, if God, who took care of the Fortune and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that King, had not amuſed Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> with a fooliſh hope, which made her fail of ſo fair an Occaſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Charles</hi> King of <hi>England</hi> had great black Eyes, his Eye-brows were thick, and met together, was of a brown Complexion, a handſome Noſe, a long Viſage, his Hair was black and curled; he was tall, and fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhaped; he had an auſtere Preſence, and yet loft and civil more in good than in ill Fortune: He was brave, that is to ſay, that he had the Courage of a Souldier, and the Soul of a Prince: He was a great Wit, and loved Pleaſures, but yet he loved his Duty more: In ſhort, he was one of the greateſt Kings in the World: But however, tho Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture had gifted him with admirable Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, Adverſity, that had been his Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:61590:80"/>
was the principal Cauſe of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Merit.</p>
               <p>The Prince at his leaving of <hi>France,</hi> had ſhown, as I have already ſaid, very little conſideration for Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon;</hi> but having known the value that the Spaniards ſet on her, by the Penſion they had given her, and the Credit that ſhe had at the Court of <hi>France,</hi> by the means of the Abbot <hi>Fouc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quett,</hi> was reinflamed for her: And his Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was ſo violent, that he wrote to her the moſt paſſionate Letters in the World, and amongſt others, this was intercepted that he wrote to her in Cyphers.</p>

               <p>The hopes that Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> had upon this Letter of marrying the Prince, made her think of refuſing the offers of the King of <hi>England;</hi> hereupon ſhe conſulted one of her female Friends in <hi>Bordeaux</hi>'s pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. She, whoſe Husband was with the Prince, told her Miſtreſs that ſhe was mad once to think of marrying a ſhaddow of a King, a Wretch who had not wherewith to live, and who in making her to be laughed at, would ruin her in a little time, that if
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:61590:81"/>
it was poſſible, contrary to all appearances in the World, that he ſhould one day reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver his Throne, ſhe might very well believe that being weary of her, he would be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced from her upon the pretext of the inequality of Condition: Her Friend told her on the contrary, that her madneſs was to marry the Prince who was married, and whoſe Wife was in health, that perſons of the Quality of the King of <hi>England</hi> might be ſometimes under ill Fortune, but that they could never be in that extream neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo common to private Perſons: That it was fine for a Lady to live a Queen, tho ſhe ſhould live unhappy; and that ſhe ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to refuſe an honourable Title, tho ſhe was only to bear it upon her Grave. As for you Mademoiſelle, turning towards <hi>Bordeaux,</hi> you have reaſon to talk as you do to her Grace, conſidering only your own intereſt; but for my part, who only conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Graces, I tell her what I ought to ſay. Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> gave them thanks for the kindneſs they ſhowed her, and told them that ſhe would take time to think of their Reaſons before ſhe came to a Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. She was not willing to give a more poſitive Anſwer before her Friend in an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair ſhe was aſhamed ſhe ſhould chooſe what
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:61590:81"/>
was contrary to her advice; In the mean time there came Notice from ſeveral parts to the King of <hi>England</hi> of the Life of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>Chaſtillon,</hi> and of her preſent Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct with the Abbot <hi>Foucquett.</hi> Never any Man that had the leaſt ſenſe of Honour, did loſe his Reaſon ſo much as in the beginning of his Paſſion to marry a Woman without Honour.</p>
               <p>The King of <hi>England</hi> went from the Neighbourhood of <hi>Marlou</hi> as ſoon as He had learnt all theſe news, and would not hazard, by ſeeing Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> a Conflict that might be doubtfull between his ſences and his Reaſon. Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> was not then ſenſible of the loſs ſhe had: the deſires and hopes ſhe had of marrying the Prince rendered all other things indifferent to her.</p>
               <p>Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> being returned from her Dutchy to <hi>Marlou</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Spring, through the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of the Marſhall <hi>d' Hocquincourt,</hi> and ſometime after to <hi>Paris,</hi> he did not find her ungratefull for this favour. This little ſervice and the promiſes he gave her of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Cardinal and putting his Places into the Princes hands, touched Madam <hi>de Chaſtillons</hi> Heart to that point, that ſhe
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:61590:82"/>
granted enjoyment to the Marſchal. The Summer paſſed in this manner during, which the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> who perceived this Commerce, was often under ſtrange diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiets; and he had done at that time what he did afterwards, if Lovers did not love to deceive themſelves, when they are ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to quit or condemn their Miſtreſſes.</p>
               <p>The Winter after, the Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> at his return from <hi>Catalonia,</hi> ſeemed to be in love with Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon;</hi> The Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> allarum'd at ſo dangerous a Rivall, cauſed <hi>Boligneux</hi> to deſire him to ceaſe his perſuit. The Duke of <hi>Candale</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at that time really in love with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> and had only engaged himſelf with Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> to make her ſerve for a pretext, eaſily granted the Abbot <hi>Foucquett's</hi> Requeſt. But as with this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs Lovers were as an <hi>Hydra,</hi> of whom one head was no ſooner cut off, but that an other ſprung up in the room, <hi>la Feuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade</hi> took the place of the Duke of <hi>Candale;</hi> The Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> who knew it immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, ſpoke himſelf pretty ſharply of it to la <hi>Fuillade,</hi> who whether that he fancyed that his Rivall being beloved he ſhould not ſucceed in his Enterprize, or whether that his blooming Paſſion left him all his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:61590:82"/>
he did not judge it Convenient to incurr the hatred of ſo violent a Man; wherefore he did not perſevere in that Amour. The Marqueſs <hi>de Cozuvres</hi> had not ſo much Complaiſance as <hi>Feuillade</hi> had, he continued to ſee Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> maugre the Abbot <hi>Foucquett;</hi> but as he had neither Fortune nor Merit enough to touch her Heart, ſhe only made a Conqueſt of him, and only kept him in play to inflame the Abbot <hi>Foucquett,</hi> and oblige him to renew his Preſents, and let him know that ſhe had Perſons of Quality on her ſide who would not ſuffer her to be miſuſed. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Abbot was forced to bear with this Rivall but he vented his Choler upon poor <hi>Vinevil;</hi> who was one of the firſt Lovers of Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> beloved, a Man of good Senſe, and whoſe Wit was to be feared. The Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> gave the Cardinal to underſtand that it was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to leave him at <hi>Paris;</hi> inſomuch that the Cardinal ſeeing only through the Abbots Eyes, ſent an order to <hi>Vinevil</hi> to go to <hi>Tours</hi> till further order; and he not being ſuffered to take his leave of Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> wrote her this Letter on the laſt of October 1651.</p>

Do but conſider, Madam, of the prejudice that your Reputation receives from this Commerce; and make reflection upon what you are, and upon what he is who has depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved you of your Honour; for the Credit and Conſideration he procures you are not very ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, and they are falſe lights which reflect upon you, rather to offend you than to give you a luſtre. Ah!

               <p>Notwithſtanding <hi>Vinevil</hi>'s Baniſhment, The Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> was no more at eaſe than he was before, Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> making him mad every moment; but that which diſquieted him moſt was the Intrigue between her and the Marſhall <hi>d' Hocquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court.</hi> This had rendred her ſo haughty that ſhe had often treated the Abbot <hi>Fouc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quett</hi> as if ſhe had not known him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:61590:84"/>
During theſe paſſages the Marſhal <hi>de Hocquincourt</hi> finding himſelf preſſed by Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> to perform the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes he had made her, which not being willing to do, he gave notice to the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal of all that he had promiſed Madam <hi>de Chastillon,</hi> by one of his Gentlemen, who ſeemed to betray him, and at the ſame time cauſed the ſame notice to be given to the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> by Madam <hi>Calvoiſin,</hi> the Governour of <hi>Roye</hi>'s Wife. This peice of Cunning had the effect, that the Marſhall had promiſed himſelf; the Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal was alarum'd, and to break of ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous an Intrigue cauſed the Marſhal <hi>d' Hocquincourt</hi> to be treated with. The Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot <hi>Foucquett</hi> for his part, having had the information from <hi>Calvoiſin,</hi> deſired the Cardinal that he would cauſe Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> to be took into Cuſtody, and put in ſuch a place where ſhe might not have any Correſpondence till that he ſhould think fit to reſtore her to her liberty. The Cardinal having given his conſent, the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> cauſed Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> to be ſeized on at <hi>Marlou,</hi> and conducted with one of her Women to <hi>Paris,</hi> where he cauſed her to be brought in by Night, and lodged her at one <hi>de Vaux</hi>'s Houſe in
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:61590:85"/>
                  <hi>Poitow-ſtret.</hi> On the morrow after her ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> took a Note under her hand by order from the Cardinal, and directed to the Marſhal <hi>d' Hocquincourt,</hi> by which ſhe deſired him to come to an accomodation with the King, and not to think any longer of the Prince or of her, becauſe it might endanger his Life; &amp; as ſome days before ſhe was taken ſhe had agreed with the Marſhal, that in caſe they hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be taken into cuſtody, and that Letters were exacted from them, contrary to the meaſures they had taken together, they ſhould give no Credit to them if they were not written with a double C. Which ſhe did not do in this Letter, but ſhe did in an other which ſhe wrote at the ſame time to the Marſhal; by which ſhe let him know that he ſhould remain firm in the firſt reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution that he had taken of ſerving the Prince, and of delivering up his Places to him; which the Marſhal never intended, and had only promiſed Madam <hi>de Chaſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> that he would, that he might obtain fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours from her, and to procure advantages from the Cardinal, which he could not have without making himſelf be feared; he ſuppreſſed the Letter of intelligence, and ſent that to the Prince which the Abbot
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:61590:85"/>
                  <hi>Foucquett</hi> had cauſed Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon</hi> to write to him, by which knowing that ſhe was in danger of her life, he ſent him word to make his peace with the Court, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he got Madam <hi>de Chastillon</hi> releaſed out of Priſon. The Cardinal believing the Marſhal to be really in love with Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> and that he would give all that he ſhould demand of him to ſet her at liberty, would have deducted upon her account an hundred thouſand Livers, out of the hundred thouſand Crowns they had agreed of together: But the Marſhal would not conſent to it, and yet that ſhe might not think him a cheat, and to keep ſome meaſures with her ſtill, he would not put his places into the Cardinals hands, til he knew that the Dutcheſs was ſet at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; inſomuch that to ſatisfy him in that point, they deceived him, and ſent the Dutcheſs to the fathers Oratory to ſhew her ſelf to a Gentleman he had ſent on purpoſe for that end; with whom ſhe was free, after which ſhe returned to her priſon, where ſhe was eight days longer. During the three weeks that ſhe was a Priſoner in <hi>Poitou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet,</hi> the Abbot was not ſo free as ſhe, he became daily more and more ſmitten; for as with the liberty of going and coming
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:61590:86"/>
he likewiſe deprived her of that of deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him; he found her a thouſand times more lovely than before. Beſides the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs being willing to recover his eſteem that ſhe migh procure being ſet at liberty, uſed him after ſuch a manner as was capable of melting the heart of a Barbarian, and had a thouſand kindneſſes and Complyances for him: and ſhe ſeemed to put ſo entire a Confidence in him, that he could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear beleiving that ſhe would never depend again on any Body but him.</p>
               <p>Things being in this Poſture, the Abbot ſurprized a very kind Letter, that the Dutcheſs wrote to the Prince of <hi>Condé.</hi> This grieved him ſo extreamly, that in reproaching her, he would have poiſoned himſelf with Quickſilver from behind a Looking-glaſs; but beginning to find himſelf ill, he loſt the deſire of dying for a faithleſs one, and took <hi>Theriaque</hi> which he uſually carried about him to ſecure himſelf from Enemies, which the employ he had about the Cardinal procured him daily. Except going where ſhe pleaſed, the Dutcheſs paſſed her time very pleaſantly in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; The Abbot treated her with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Delicacies, and made her daily very conſiderable Preſents in Knacks and Jewels;
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:61590:86"/>
he went from thence at two a Clock in the Night, and came again at eight in the Morning, thus was he with her eighteen hours in four and twenty.</p>
               <p>It was impoſſible but that the Cardinal muſt know where the Dutcheſs was, and this is pleaſant that this great Man, who decided the Fate of <hi>Europe,</hi> ſhould go halves with the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> in an amourous ſecret: I beleive that the reaſon he had to approve this Commerce was, that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Dutcheſs to be Intriguing, he choſe rather ſhe ſhould be in the Abbots hands, whom he was ſure of, than in an other; and beſides the Abbot keeping her in a Chamber, and abſolutely diſhonoring her thereby, he was glad that the Prince of <hi>Condé</hi> her Couſin and lover, might receive thereby an extraordinary mortification. But at length the Marſhal <hi>d' Hocquincourts'</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation being made, upon Condition that the Dutcheſs ſhould be releaſed out of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, ſhe was to be let at liberty. They ſent her to <hi>Marlou,</hi> where ſome time after the worſt accident imaginable happened</p>
               <p>The Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> and ſhe had agreed together, that every <hi>Saturday</hi> they would mutually return the Letters they had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to one another all the week long, and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:61590:87"/>
that he would ſend for them by a Man who ſhould ſay that he belonged to Mademoiſelle <hi>Vertus.</hi> This Man being one day at <hi>Marlou,</hi> a footman came thither from the Marſhal <hi>d' Hocquincourt,</hi> with a Letter for the Dutcheſs, who having writ her anſwers, and given them to a Chambermaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them to the Bearers, this Woman miſtook, and gave the Abbot's Man the anſwer that her Miſtriſs ſent the Marſhal, and to the Marſhal's Lacquie the Pacquet deſigned for the Abbot. It is eaſie to imagine in what allarms the Dutcheſs was ſo ſoon as ſhe knew the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake, and particularly when it is known that in the Letter, which ſhe wrote to the Abbot, beſides a thouſand kind things, there was alſo a long Chapter againſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>de Bregi,</hi> whom ſhe hated, becauſe ſhe had naturally the Charms of Body and of mind which the Dutcheſs had only by Art. It is certain thet the Dutcheſs had ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied her and was never able to pardon her Merit. In an other place, ſhe railed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my Lord <hi>Mountague,</hi> and almoſt in every part of it made the moſt biting raille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries imaginable upon the Marſhal. And when ſhe thought of the Abbot's Letters which ſhe had ſent to him, wherein there
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:61590:87"/>
were tenderneſſes and tranſports of love, which might be good to a Miſtreſs, but which uſually appear very ridiculous to the indifferent, and that all this was in the hands of a haughty and a laughed at Rival, ſhe was almoſt mad: The Abbot for his part was in no leſs pain. As for the Marſhal ſo ſoon as he had ſeen all the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot's Letters, and thoſe that the Dutcheſs wrote to him, he judged that he might be one day obliged to reſtore them her out of his weakneſs to her, or through the deſires of her Friends, inſomuch that he might be in a capacity to take his revenge on her when he pleaſed: He cauſed copies to be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of them all, and then went and ſhowed the originals to the Duke of <hi>Rochefoucault,</hi> to Madam <hi>Piſieux,</hi> whom he knew to be the Dutcheſſes Enemies. After that the Abbot had been one Night at <hi>Marlou,</hi> he returned to <hi>Paris</hi> to the Merſhals Houſe, of whom he demanded his Letters. The Marſhal did not content himſelf with refuſing him them, but added all the raillery after his way that he could bethink himſelf of; while the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhal was thus drolling he held the Dutcheſs, Letter open to the Abbot, who had liever have been killed, than have ſuffered his Miſtreſs to have laine at his Rival's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:61590:88"/>
as ſhe did by this Letter, caught hold of it, and tore half of it off, which he went to ſhow to the Dutcheſs, telling her that the Marſhal had burnt the other halfe; but the Marſhal being enraged at this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize of the Abbots; bid him be gone im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately out of his Houſe, and that if ſome reſpects did not withhold him, he would cauſe him to be thrown out of the Window.</p>
               <p>The Dutcheſs being ſometime after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Paris,</hi> fancied that to undeceive the Publick of a thouſand Particulars, that the Marſhal had ſaid of her, it was requiſite that ſhe ſhould let People of Merit and Virtue ſee after what manner ſhe would treat him. In order to which, ſhe made choice of the Houſe of the Marqueſs <hi>de Souches,</hi> Great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſt of <hi>France,</hi> to whom and his Wife ſhe had a mind to juſtifie herſelf more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly: The Aſſignation being made with the Marſhal, he perceived her deſign. <hi>God keep thee, my poor Child,</hi> ſaid he accoſting her, <hi>How does my little Buttocks do, are they ſtill very lean?</hi> It is impoſſible to imagine the ſad Condition this diſcourſe put the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſs in! ſhe was as if ſhe had been ſtund with a blow upon her head, it made her forget to call the Marſhal Fool and Inſolent; but
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:61590:88"/>
ſhe fancied that having begun as he did, he would proceed to the moſt ſhameful parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars imaginable for her, if ſhe diſpleaſed him never ſo little. The Grand Provoſt and his Wiſe looked upon one another, and turning towards the Dutcheſs, found her with her Eyes towards the ground, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſhe did not change her Colour; but thoſe who knew her did not believe her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed. At length the Great Provoſt brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſilence, <hi>You do ill,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>my Lord Marſhal; Gallant men ought never to quarrel with Ladies, they ought to be thankul to them for the Preſents they make them of their Hearts, and ought not to offend them when they refuſe it. I grant that,</hi> ſaid the Marſhal, <hi>but when their Hearts are once given, if they change af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, it is requiſite they uſe civilly thoſe they have loved, and when they droll upon them, they expoſe themſelves to great Affronts. You un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand me, Madam,</hi> added he, turning to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Dutcheſs, <hi>I am ſure you believe that I have reaſon for what I ſay, but you ſurprize me with your diſorder; you ought to be prepared for ſuch Accidents, ſince you lay Snares for peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who revenge themſelves. I vow I would not have believed that you had ſo much Modeſty as you have.</hi> And in ending this Diſcourſe he went away, and left the Dutcheſs more dead
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:61590:89"/>
than alive. The Great Provoſt and his Wife endeavoured to bring her to herſelf; telling her, That what the Marſhal had ſaid, had not made any impreſſion upon their minds; however from that day they had no great Commerce with her.</p>
               <p>A fortnight after the Abbot was obliged to go to the Court, which was at <hi>Compeigne;</hi> The Dutcheſs foreſeeing the Prince of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dés</hi> return into <hi>France</hi> by the general Peace that was much talked of, and not being willing that he ſhould find her in ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an Intrigue for her, reſolved to break off after ſuch a manner, as that there might not remain the leaſt appearance of it. In this deſign ſhe went to the Abbots Houſe, where having found one of his Servants in whom he put moſt confidence, and asked him for the Keyes of his Maſter's Cloſet, ſaying ſhe had a mind to write him a Letter. This Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low without penetrating further, and only conſidering the Abbots Paſſion for the Dutcheſs, he gave her immediately what ſhe demanded. Seeing herſelf alone, ſhe broak the lock of the Cabinet where ſhe knew that the Abbot kept her Letters, and not only took them all, but likewiſe others from the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> which ſhe had ſacrificed to them, and went and burnt them
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:61590:89"/>
at Madam <hi>de Sourches</hi> Houſe. The Abbot having ſound this diſorder at his return home, went to the Dutcheſſes Houſe, and began to threaten to cut off her Noſe, and then broke a Chriſtal Candleſtick, and a great Looking-glaſs that he had given her, and went away after having called her a thouſand Names. During all this buſtle, one of the Dutcheſſes Chambermaids fancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Abbot would take away from her all that he had given her, laid hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her Miſtreſſes Cabinet of Jewels, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it to Madam <hi>de Sourches</hi> Houſe, from whence ſhe ſent for it again the ſame Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and gave it to a devout Relation of her Mothers to keep. The Abbot having no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it on the Morrow, went to that De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Womans Houſe, and took it away by force. The Dutcheſs being informed of the loſs ſhe had, was extreamly grieved; but ſhe did not loſe her judgment, ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed people to the Abbot, who had ſo much credit with him, that he reſtored the Cabinet; and by the means of this reſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they were as well reconciled as they had ever been; and this reconciliation was ſo ſudden, that Madam <hi>de Bouteville</hi> coming the morrow to comfort the Dutcheſs her Daughter for the accident that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:61590:90"/>
to her, the Abbot was already with her, who concealed himſelf in a Cloſet during the Viſit, and heard all the Comedy.</p>
               <p>Some time after, the Dutcheſs not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing to take alwaies the pains to conceal that ſhe ſaw the Abbot again; and fancied that ſince their quarrel was known abroad, their reconciliation ought likewiſe to be publick: Wherefore ſhe cauſed all her friends to deſire her to pardon the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot upon his ſollicitation, and at length having made it a point of Conſcience, the Mother Abbeſs, of the Convent of <hi>Mercy,</hi> a Woman ſubject to beatifical Viſitations, made them ſee and embrace one another. This Mediation brought the Reverend Mother into ſome diſcredit with the Queen and the Cardinal: They fancyed that that ſhe had not ſo particular a Commerce with God, ſince ſhe ſuffered her ſelf to be ſo eaſily deceived by Men.</p>
               <p>However this reconciliation laſted but ſix Months; The Prince of <hi>Condé</hi>'s return into <hi>France</hi> coming on daily made the Dutcheſs apprehend that he would find her under the Abbots Tutorſhip, and the Ladies <hi>de Saint Chaumond</hi> and <hi>de Feguiers</hi> made her ſo much aſhamed of him, that ſhe broak with him upon a pretext of Devotion. It
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:61590:90"/>
was very difficult for the Abbot to conſent to the Dutcheſs's deſign, and would not have done it at an other time; but ſeeing his Credit very much diminiſhed with the Cardinal, and fearing that the Prince of <hi>Condé,</hi> who hated him beſides, and <hi>Boute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> who would revenge the diſhonour he had done to his family, might cauſe him to be ſtabbed, if he gave the Dutcheſs the leaſt new Reaſon of Complaining, he left off Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but not loving her.</p>

               <p>AT that time Madam <hi>d'Olonne</hi> was gone as I have ſaid, to deſire the Counteſs of <hi>Fieſque,</hi> to thank in her name the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> for ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Obligation which was properly nothing; but ſhe had a mind the Abbot <hi>Foucquett</hi> ſhould make Reflections upon the Compliment, and make him Comprehend that when people have thanks returned them for ſuch ſmall things, they are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to be indebted to them for the greater Obligations. The ſame day that Madam <hi>d'Olonne</hi> ſaw the Counteſs, ſhe found the Abbot at Madam <hi>de Bonelles,</hi> and there ſhe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:61590:93"/>
herſelf made him the ſame Compliment: The Abbot, being very deſirons to have an Intrigue with Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the curing himſelf of the Paſſion he had ſtill for the Dutcheſs of <hi>Caſtillon,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned her Civilities as obligingly as he was able; and on the Morrow the Counteſs ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſent to ſeek him, and telling him what Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> had deſired her to ſay: <hi>I know more than you of that, Madam,</hi> ſaid he to her, <hi>and I received yeſterday Evening marks of acknowledgment from herſelf: But I would willingly know of you one thing,</hi> added he, <hi>Whether the Count</hi> de Guiche <hi>is not in love with Madam,</hi> d' Olonne; <hi>for if he is, I will avoid the Occaſion of being ſo: He has had ſo much reſpect for me upon all Occaſions, that I ſhould be ridiculous ſhould I play him ſuch a prank.

               <p>The Chevalier <hi>de Grammont,</hi> being come to the Counteſſes a moment after ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived this Ticket, found her in Bed, and ſeeing a Paper lying by her, he took it.

the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> but that ſhe appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the Counteſs might reclaim him, was willing to embroil them to ſuch a point, as that in all appearance they could not be reconciled; and for that end ſhe had no ſooner received this Letter, then that ſhe ſent it to the Counteſs: Which putting her in a rage againſt the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> ſhe ſent for <hi>Vinevil</hi> to come to her. <hi>I deſired your company, to tell you that your Friend is an impertinent Fool, and whom I will have nothing more to do with. See the Letter he has newly written to Madam</hi> d' Olonne; <hi>he complains that I perſwade the Abbot</hi> Foucquett <hi>to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in an Intrigue with his Mistreſs, and does not remember that he told me, that he had no longer any thoughts of her. I ask your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for him,</hi> anſwered <hi>Vinevil, excuſe a poor Lover, who ſeeing they deſign to deprive him of his Miſtreſs, knows not what he does, nor whom to have recourſe to: As ſoon as I ſhall have him recollect himſelf, he will come and caſt himſelf at your Feet.</hi> After ſome other Diſcourſes, <hi>Vinevil</hi> went away, and within an hour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter returned with the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> who told the Counteſs ſo many things, that ſhe promiſed to forget his rudeneſs. On the Morrow the Count having reſolved to ſpeak to the Abbot, went to him, and having ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:61590:95"/>
him aſide, <hi>If we had both begun at the ſame time,</hi> ſaid he to him, <hi>to be in love with Madam</hi> d' Olonne, <hi>it would be ridiculous to think it strange that you ſhould diſpute her with me, neither ſhould I do it; and I would leave it to herſelf to decide by Favours the good Fortune of us both. But ſince you come to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturbe me in an Intrigue, I have been long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in before you, give me leave to tell you, that this is not civil, and I deſire you to leave me at quiet with my Mistreſs, without giving me other troubles than thoſe which proceed from her rigours. I am a Friend of Madam</hi> d' Olonne<hi>'s, and nothing elſe,</hi> anſwered the Abbot, <hi>thus you have no reaſon to complain of me; How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if I thought the Diſcourſe you have now held to me, was by the advice of People, who had a mind to bring me into trouble, I declare to you I would become your Rival from this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I know why I talk to you after this manner, and you may underſtand me.</hi> The Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot pretended to ſpeak of <hi>Varde</hi> his mortal Enemy, and the Count's Friend. <hi>No,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered the Count, <hi>I know not what you mean; but what I have to ſay to you is, that being jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, that Humour has adviſed me to deſire you not to make me any longer ſo.</hi> The Abbot having given him his hand, they parted the beſt Friends imaginable. Some time after
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:61590:95"/>
the Abbot finding Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> at a place where he made a Viſit, ſhe took him aſide, to impart to him ſome ſecrets of ſmall moment, and the Abbot not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what to ſay to her, told her his diſpute with the Count. <hi>I am very glad,</hi> ſaid ſhe to him, <hi>to ſee that you, Gentlemen, diſpoſe of me, as if I was your own: Thus I find I am at preſent the Count</hi> de Guiches, <hi>ſince you have made him your declaration that you have no pretences to me. Ah! Madam,</hi> anſwered the Abbot, <hi>I would not give you to any Body, if it was in my power to do it; as I love my ſelf better than any one in the World, I would keep you for my ſelf; but upon the ſuſpicions that the Count</hi> de Guiche <hi>has, that I have a Paſſion for you, I declare to him that I have no ſuch thoughts, and this betwixt you and me, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, becauſe I truſt my good Fortune, for—No, no,</hi> interrupted Madam <hi>d' Olonne, do not continue talking to me contrary to what you think; you know well enough that you are not ſo unhappy as you ſay.</hi> The Abbot finding himſelf ſo preſſed, could not forbear an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, That ſhe knew him better than he did himſelf; that it being in her power to make King's themſelves happy, he ſhould think his Fortune made, if ſhe would aſſure him of it; and moreover, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:61590:96"/>
he had made the Count, ſhould not hinder him from loving her, when he ſhould ſee any likelyhood of being beloved. This Converſation ended with ſo many Favours from Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> that the Abbot for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got that he was ſtill in love with Madam <hi>de Chaſtillon,</hi> inſomuch that he reſolved to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage himſelf without inclination with Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>d' Olonne;</hi> he fancied that by entereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Body by Pleaſures, he might diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage the Mind, whoſe Intereſts are ſo inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven: And indeed, Madam <hi>d' Olonne,</hi> whom time was very dear to, did not let the Abbot languiſh; but as their Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence could not laſt long without the Counts perceiving it, he went to her Houſe to make her his Complaints: Being at her Chamber door, he heard a noiſe, which ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged him to liſten to what it was. He heard Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> ſaying a thouſand kind things to ſome Body, which increaſing his Curioſity, he looked through the Key-hole, and ſaw his Miſtreſs making as tender Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes to her Husband, as if he had been a Lover. This did not a little diſguſt him; he went home in a pet, where having taken Ink and Paper, he wrote this following Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to <hi>Vinevil,</hi>

               <p>The Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> being returned on the morrow to Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi>'s Houſe, referred his reproaching her upon her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands account till another time, and thought ſit to ſpeak then only of the Abbot <hi>Fouc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quett.</hi>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:61590:97"/>
Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> being ever full of Conſideration, when ſhe was to loſe a Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, not ſo much out of fear of his Vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as becauſe ſhe leſſened the number, told the Count <hi>de Guiche</hi> that he was Maſter of her Conduct, that he might preſcribe to her what manner of life he pleaſed; that if the Abbot gave him umbrage, ſhe would not only ſee him no more, but if he was willing he ſhould be witneſs after what rate ſhe would rattle him. The Count, who never durſt have asked her ſo great a Sacrifice, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the Offers ſhe made him: The Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation being made to be at my Lord <hi>Croft</hi>'s Houſe the next day; where Madam <hi>d' Olonne</hi> having no other Company than the Count and the Abbot, ſpoke to the laſt after this manner, after having concerted all the Evening before. <q>I deſired you, Mr. Abbot, to come hither, to tell you in the preſence of my Lord the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> that I do not love you, and that I can never love any Body but him; we were both very willing that you ſhould know it, that you might not plead ignorance: Not that you have hitherto carried your ſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me otherwiſe than as a Friend; but as you had no deſign, you have not perhaps taken notice that your Viſits were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:61590:97"/>
too frequent, and you know that that is not uſually very pleaſing to ſo amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Man as the Count, what confidence ſoever he has in his Miſtreſs. For my part I ſhall ſpend my whole life in thinking how to pleaſe him: I was willing to make you this Declaration, leſt that you without thinking, ſhould bring your ſelf into trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; I ſhall be overjoyed to have you for my Friend, but the leſs commerce we have together, the better it will be. 'Yes, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, I give you my word, ſaid the Abbot to her, I am very much of the Count <hi>de Guiches</hi> Opinion, I have paſſed through all the degrees of Jealouſie, and this is not the firſt time that he and I have diſcourſed upon this point. I know the promiſes I made him, and I am ſure I have not broken them. 'The truth is, interrupted the Count, that I cannot complain of you; but as her Ladyſhip has ſaid very well, that as you have no deſign, you did not think you did contrary to what you promiſed me, and appearances are only againſt you. 'Well, replyed the Abbot to him, let not this hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der you from being happy, for I give you my word that I will not. Her Ladiſhip deſignedly but once a Month, but for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counters I cannot anſwer for them; but it
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:61590:98"/>
is your part to take ſecurities in that caſe.</q>
               </p>
               <p>After a thouſand Civilitiess on all ſides, they parted.</p>
               <p>It will be perhaps wondred at, that the Abbot ſuffered Rivals ſo impatiently in his Intrigues with the Dutcheſs of <hi>Chastillon,</hi> and was ſo tractable with Madam <hi>d' Olonne;</hi> but the reaſon is, that with the former there was love in the caſe, and with the latter nothing but Debauche; and that the Body can bear with Aſſociates, which the Heart can never do.</p>
               <p>Sometime after <hi>d' Olonne</hi> being informed of the ill Conduct of his Wife, reſolved to ſend her into the Country, as well to hinder her from committing new Follies, as to ſtifle the Reports which her Preſence daily renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And indeed, ſo ſoon as ſhe was depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there was no more thoughts of her; and a thouſand other Copies of Madam <hi>d'Olonne,</hi> which <hi>Paris</hi> is full of, cauſed that great O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal to be forgotten in a ſhort time.</p>
               <p>There likewiſe hapned an Intrigue, which without being of the nature of Madam <hi>d' O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonne,</hi> did however ſuppreſs them for a time.</p>
               <p>The Count <hi>Vivonne,</hi> firſt Gentleman of the King's Chamber, and for whom his Majeſty had naturally an inclination, being retired to a Houſe he had near <hi>Paris,</hi> to
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:61590:98"/>
ſpend the <hi>Eaſter</hi> Holy days with two of his Friends, the Abbot <hi>le Camus</hi> and <hi>Manchini</hi> this laſt Cardinals Nephew, and the other one of the Kings Almoners; and having paſſed there three or four days, if not in a great Devotion, at leaſt in very innocent Pleaſures, the Count of <hi>Guiche</hi> and <hi>Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp,</hi> being weary of <hi>Paris,</hi> went to him. As ſoon as the Abbot <hi>le Camus</hi> ſaw them, knowing them to be very diſſolute, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded <hi>Manchini</hi> to return to <hi>Paris,</hi> and that the next day, for that the World would ſay there had paſſed ſtrange things amongſt them: And <hi>Manchini</hi> that very evening declaring this deſign, <hi>Manicamp</hi> and the Count <hi>de Guiche,</hi> propoſed to <hi>Vivonne</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire <hi>Buſſy</hi> to come and paſs two or three days without them, telling him that he was very capable to fill the place of the other two: <hi>Vivonne</hi> having given his Conſent, wrote a Letter to <hi>Buſſy</hi> in all their names, that he was deſired to quit for ſome time the hurry of the World, to come to them, that they might with the leſs diſtraction, give them ſelves up together to the thoughts of Eternity. But before I paſs further, it is fit I deſcribe <hi>Vivonne</hi> and <hi>Buſſy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The firſt had great blew Eyes even with his Head, whoſe Balls were often half
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:61590:99"/>
hid under his Eyelids, and contrary to his intention, made him look languiſhingly; he had a handſome Noſe, a little and full Mouth, a fine Complexion, a fine, great and fair head of Hair; He was indeed ſomething too fat, he had a quick Wit, and a good Fancy; but he ſtudyed too much how to be pleaſant; he loved to ſpeak Equivoques, and words with a double ſence; and that he might be the more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, he often made them at home and ſtarted them in the Companies where he came, as if they had been freſh thoughts; he was quickly engaged in Friendſhip with people without any diſcretion; But whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he found them perſons of Merit or no, he as ſuddenly abandoned them; What made his inclination laſt longeſt was flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, but it was to no purpoſe for a perſon to be extraordinary, if he did not admire him, he would have had no great eſteem for him. As he fancyed that a ſigne of a good will was a niceneſs for all works, he found nothing to his mind of all he ſaw, and uſually he judged of Books without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg and reaſon: In ſhort, he was ſo blin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with his own merit, that he ſaw none in any Body elſe; and to ſpeak like himſelf, he had both a great deal of ſufficiency, and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:61590:99"/>
a great deal of inſufficiency; he was Bold in War, and fearfull in Love: And yet if any body would have believed him, he had his will of all the Women he had attempted; but the truth is he had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by certain Ladies, who, till then had never refuſed any Man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Roger de Rabutin,</hi> Count of <hi>Buſſy,</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor General of the light Horſe, had great ſweet Eyes, a handſome Mouth, a ſomething hawkiſh Noſe, an open Face, and a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Phiſiognomy, fair, clear light Hair; His Wit had delicacy and force, Gaity and Mirth; he talked well; he writ exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and agreably; he was of a ſoft diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; But thoſe, whom his Merit had cauſed to envy him, had netled him, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he willingly made merry with people he did not love; He was a good and regular Friend; he was brave without oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentation; he loved Pleaſures more than Fortune, but he loved Glory more than Pleaſures: He was Gallant with all Ladies, and very civill, and the familiarity he had with his beſt Friends, never made him wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the reſpect he owed them. This kind of behaviour made it thought that he had a paſſion for them; and it is certain that he had ever ſome ſence of love in all
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:61590:100"/>
the great intrigues he had had, he had been long in the Wars and had done good ſervice, but as in this Age it was not ſufficient to be of a good Family, to have Wit, Courage, and have done great Services to procure Honours, with all theſe Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, he was got but half way of his fortune; he had not the baſeneſs to flatter thoſe people, whom <hi>Mazarine,</hi> the Soveraign Diſpenſour of Favours, put Confidence in, or had not been in a Condition to force them from him, by making him afraid, as moſt of the Marſhals of his time had done.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Buſſy,</hi> having this Letter from <hi>Vivonne,</hi> took Hors immediately, and went to his Houſe: he found his friends very much diſpoſed to mirth, and he, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing uſually a Diſturber of Feaſts, ordered it ſo that their joy was altogether Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat: and accoſting them, <hi>I am very glad my Friends,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to find you diſengaged from the World as you are, a particular Grace from God is neceſſary to work out our ſalvation: In the hurreis of Courts, Ambition, Envy, Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting, Love, and a thouſand other Paſſions; do uſually engage the best People in Crimes, which they are encapable of in ſuch Retreats as this, let us ſave our ſelves then together, my friends, and as to be pleaſing to God, it is neither ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:61590:100"/>
                  <hi>to weep nor to dye of Hunger; let us be merry, my Friends, and make good Chear.</hi> This Sentiment being generally approved of, they prepared themſelves for Hunting in the afternoon, and gave order to have Conſorts of Inſtruments for the next day: After having hunted four or five hours, theſe Gentlemen having got themſelves a great ſtomach, eat as heartily as is ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable: ſupper being ended, which had laſted three hours, during which the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had been in that Mirth which alwaies accompanies a good Conſcience, cauſed Horſes to be brought to walk in the Park: where theſe four Friends finding themſelves at liberty, to encourage themſelves to have the more contempt for the World, they propoſed to rail againſt all human kind; but a moment after Reflection made <hi>Buſſy</hi> ſay that they ought to except their true Friends from that general proſcription; this advice having been approved of by them all, Every one demanded of the reſt of the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Quarter for what he loved: This being done, and the the ſignal given for the contempt of things here below theſe good ſouls begun a Canticle. You may judge that having took this Courſe, all was comprehended in the Canticle, except thoſe four Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:61590:101"/>
Friends, but as the Number were but ſmall, the Canticle was great and ſharp, inſomuch that ſhould nothing be forgot, it would make a Volume: Part of the Night being ſpent in theſe rural Pleaſures, they reſolved to go to reſt; Wherefore they left one another very much ſatisfied to ſee the progreſs they had begun to make in Devotion. <hi>Vivonne</hi> and <hi>Buſſy</hi> being got up earlier the next morning than the others, went into <hi>Manicamps</hi> Chamber; but not having found him, and thinking he was gone a Walking in the Park, they went into the Count <hi>de Guiches</hi> Chambers, with whom they found him in Bed: <hi>You</hi> ſee <hi>My Friends,</hi> ſaid <hi>Manicamp</hi> to them, <hi>that I endeavour to make good uſe of the things you spoke of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day touching the Contempt of the world, I have already Won my ſelf to deſpiſe the half, and I hope in ſhort time, except it be my particular Friends, to have no great inclination for the other; we often Compaſs the ſame and by different me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods,</hi> anſwered <hi>Buſſy to</hi> him; <hi>for my part I do not Condemn your manners; Every one is ſaved after his own way; But I ſhall never take that courſe to be happy that you do. I am amazed to hear you talk after this rate,</hi> ſaid <hi>Manicamp, and that Madam de</hi> Savigny <hi>has not diſguſted you from loving of Women; But now you talk</hi>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:61590:101"/>
                  <hi>of Madam</hi> de Sevigny, ſaid <hi>Vivonne, pray you tell us why you broak off with her, for they talk differently; ſome ſay that you were jealous of the Count of</hi> Lude, <hi>and others that you ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed her to Madam</hi> de Monglas; <hi>and no Body has beleived what you both have ſaid, that it was a reaſon of interest. When I ſhall have made appear</hi> replyed <hi>Buſſy, that I have been theſe ſix years in love with Madam de</hi> Monglaſs, <hi>you will beleive that there was nothing of love in the falling out that was laſt year between Madam</hi> de Sevigny <hi>and me. Ah! My Dear,</hi> interrupted <hi>Vivonne, how ſhould we be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to you, if you would take the pains to relate to us an amourous Hiſtory; But firſt of all be pleaſed to give me an account of this Madam</hi> de Sevigny; <hi>for I never ſaw two perſons agree in their Opinions of her. What you ſay is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining of her in a few words,</hi> anſwered <hi>Buſſy, peoples opinions of her do not agree becauſe ſhe is unequall, and that one perſon alone is never long enough in her favour, to obſerve the change of her humour; but having known her from her Infancy I will give you a faithful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</hi>

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:61590:102"/>
grant that ſhe is too pleaſant: If a Perſon has wit, and particularly of that kind of wit which will be free and merry, there needs no more than to ſee her, there is nothing loſt with her: She underſtands you, comprehends exactly your meaning, ſhe divines you, and uſually leads you much farther than you think of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſometimes you give her a mighty pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, the heat of pleaſantry hurries her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and under thoſe Circumſtances ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives with joy all libertine expreſſions, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they be finely wrapt up, &amp; keeps pace with her anſwers, and thinks it for her ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſurpaſs all that can be ſaid to her. It is no ſtrange thing that you find not much diſcretion in a Perſon of ſo much fire; thoſe two things being uſually incompatible, and Nature cannot work Miracles in ſavour of her: A brisk Fool takes more with her than a wel-bred ſerious Man; the gaiety of People prepoſſeſſes her, that ſhe ſhall be judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you underſtand what ſhe ſays; the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mark of wit that can be given her, is to admire her. She loves Incenſe, ſhe loves being beloved, and in order to that ſhe loves that ſhe may reap, ſhe gives praiſe that ſhe may receive it; ſhe generally loves all men, of what Age, of what Birth, of what Merit, and what Profeſſion ſoever they are, from the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Robe to the Frock, from the Scepter to

the Inkhorn; amongſt Men ſhe loves a Lover better than a Friend, and amongſt Lovers the merry more than the ſad; the Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly flatter her Vanity, and the Brisk her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination; ſhe diverts herſelf with theſe, and flatters herſelf with an opinion that her Merit muſt be great, ſince ſhe is able to make thoſe others languiſh.</p>
                  <p>She is of a cold temper, at leaſt if we might believe her deceaſed Husband, and it was to it that he was obliged for her Vertue as he ſaid; all her heat is in her will. The truth is it makes full recompence for the coldneſs of her temper; I believe that Conjugal Faith has not that violence if we conſider the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it is another thing to ſpeak freely, I believe her Husband clear before Men, but I take him for a Cuckold before God. This fair One being willing to ſhare in all diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements, has found a ſure means, as ſhe thinks, to take her Pleaſures without injuring her Reputation in the leaſt: She has contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted Friendſhip with four or five pretended <hi>Lucretia</hi>'s, with whom ſhe goes into all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces imaginable; ſhe does not ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what ſhe does, as with whom ſhe is: By thus doing, ſhe perſwades herſelf that the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Company rectifies all her actions, and for my part, I fancy that the critical Minute, which is uſually found with all women when
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:61590:103"/>
only a Man and a Woman is together, would ſooneſt be met with her in the midſt of her Family. Sometimes ſhe openly refuſes a match of publick walking to eſtabliſh herſelf in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the World in an Opinion of great regularity, and ſometime after thinking her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſafe by ſo publick a refuſal, ſhe will make four or five matches of private walks; ſhe has naturally a love for Pleaſures; two things oblige her ſometimes to deprive herſelf of them, Policy and Inequality; and it was for one of thoſe two reaſons that ſhe goes ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to a Sermon, the nex day after an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly. With ſome ſuch publick Actions ſhe thinks to prepoſſeſs all the World, and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines that in doing a little good, and a little ill; all that can be ſaid is, that one producing the other, ſhe is a Civil Woman. The Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers, which her little Court is full of, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her after another rate, they never fail to tell her, that it is impoſſible to reconcile Wiſdom with the World, and Pleaſure with Vertue, better than ſhe does. To have Wit, and be of Quality, ſhe ſuffers herſelf to be too much dazled with the grandeurs of Court; the day the Queen has ſpoken to her, &amp; perhaps only asked whom ſhe came with, ſhe will be ſo tranſported with joy, and a long time after ſhe will find means to acquaint all thoſe, whoſe reſpect ſhe has a mind to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:61590:104"/>
how obliginly the Queen ſpoke to her. The King having one Evening cauſed her to dance, and being returned to her place, which was near me; <hi>It muſt be confeſſed,</hi> ſaid ſhe to me, <hi>that the King has great Qualities, I believe, he will obſcure the Glories of all his Predecſſors.</hi> I could not forbear laughing in her face; and anſwering her, <hi>There is no doubt to be made of it, Madam, after what he had now done for you.</hi> She was then ſo ſatisfied with his Majeſty, that I ſaw her upon the point of declaring her acknowledgment by ſaying, God bleſs the King.</p>
                  <p>There are people who only let holy things put bounds to to their friendſhip, and who would do all for their Friends ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept offending God. Theſe people call themſelves Friends to the very Altars: the friendſhip of Madam <hi>de Sevigny</hi> has others Limits, that fair one is only a friend as far as the purſe; There was never any pretty Woman but ſhe in the World, that diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored her ſelf by ingratitude; ſhe muſt needs be much afraid of neceſſity, ſince to avoid only the ſhadow of it, ſhe is not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of ſhame. Thoſe who would excuſe her ſay that ſhe has too much regard to the Counſell of people, who know what hunger is, and who ſtill remember their poverty: Whether this humour proceeds
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:61590:104"/>
from others or from her ſelf, nothing is ſo natural as what appears in her Oeconomy.</p>
                  <p>The greateſt application that Madam <hi>de Sevigny</hi> has is to ſeem what ſhe is not; ſince ſhe has ſtudied that Courſe, ſhe has already learnt to deceive thoſe who had no great acquaintance with her: but as there are people who have intereſſed themſelves in her more than others, they have unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately for her perceived and diſcovered, that all is not Gold that gliſters.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>de Sevigny</hi> is unequal to the very Balls of her Eyes and to her Eye-lids; her Eyes are of different Colours, and the Eyes being the mirours of the Soul, theſe irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities are as a mark that nature gives to thoſe who come near her not to rely much upon her kindneſs.</p>
                  <p>I know not if it is that her Armes are not very handſome, that ſhe is not very tender of them, or that ſhe does not think it a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, the thing being ſo general; but in ſhort who will may take and kiſs them, I fancy that it is ſufficient to perſwade her that there is no ill in it, that ſhe belives they take no pleaſure in it. Nothing but Cuſtome can now conſtrain her, but ſhe will not ſtick to ſhow it rather than Men well knowing, that having made modes when they pleaſed Civility is no longer included in ſuch narrow Bounds,</p>

This is, my Dear, the Picture of Madam <hi>de Sevigny:</hi> her eſtate which would have been a great help to mine and had belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to our family, obliged my Father to deſign I ſhould marry her; But tho I was ſo well acquainted with her then, as I am at preſent, I did not anſwer my Fathers deſign, certain looſe Courſes I ſaw her take made me apprehenſive; And I found her the prettyeſt Creature imaginable to be the Wife of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. This ſentiment helped me mightily from marrying her; But as ſhe was married a ſhort time after me, I fell in love with her, and the ſtrongeſt reaſon that obliged me to make her my Miſtreſs, was that which had hindred me from deſiring to be her Huſband.</p>
                  <p>As I was her near Relation, I had a very great acceſs to her Houſe, and I ſaw the vexations her husband daily gave her, ſhe complained thereof very often to me, and deſired me to make him aſhamed of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ridiculous inclinations he had: I ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her in this very happily for ſome time; but at length her Husbands nature being too ſtrong for my Counſels, after ſome delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it came into my head to be in love with her, more through the Conveniency of the Coniuncture, than through the force of my inclination. Inſomuch that <hi>Sevigny</hi> having one day told me that he had paſſed the
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:61590:105"/>
Night before the moſt agreable imaginably, not only as to himſelf, but the Lady with whom he had ſpent it. <hi>You may believe,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded he, <hi>that it was not with your Coſin; it was with</hi> Ninon. <hi>So much the worſe for you,</hi> ſaid I to him; <hi>my Coſin is a thouſand times a finer Woman than ſhe, and I am ſure if ſhe was not your Wife, you would make her your Miſtreſs. All this may be,</hi> anſwered he: <hi>I had no ſooner left him then that I went to give him an account of all to Madam</hi> de Sevigny. <hi>This is a fine thing to brag of,</hi> ſaid ſhe to me bluſhing for vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. <hi>Do not you ſeem to know any thing of it,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I, <hi>for you ſee the Conſequence? I think you are a fool,</hi> replyed ſhe, <hi>to give me that advice, or that you take me for one. You would certainly be ſo, Madam,</hi> replyed I, <hi>if you do not pay him in his own Coin, or if you ſhould tell him again what I have told you: Take revenge, my fair Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, I will go halves with you in your Vengeance; for in ſhort, your Interests are as dear to me as my own. Hold, good my Lord,</hi> ſaid ſhe to me, <hi>I am not ſo vexed as you imagine: Having met with</hi> Sevigny <hi>the next day at the Court, he came to me into my Coach; as ſoon as he was in, I fancy,</hi> ſaid he to me, <hi>that you told your Coſin what I yeſterday acquainted you with of</hi> Ninon, <hi>becauſe ſhe has hinted ſomething of it to me: I,</hi> replyed I, <hi>I have not ſpoke to her; but as ſhe has a great deal of Wit, ſhe has ſaid to me ſo many</hi>

                     <hi>things upon the point of jealouſie, that ſhe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times hits at the truth.</hi> Sevigny <hi>being ſatisfied with ſo good a reaſon, fell to diſcourſe of his good fortune with the Ladies, and after having told me of a thouſand advantages that there was in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in love, he concluded with telling me, that he was reſolved to be ſo as long as he lived; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that he was ſo at that time with</hi> Ninon, <hi>as deeply as it was poſſible for a man to be; that he was going to ſpend the Night at Saint</hi> Clouds <hi>with her, and with</hi> Vaſſé, <hi>who gave them a Feaſt, and which they laughed at together. I repeated to him what I had told him a thouſand times, that tho his Wife was diſcreet, he might at length, by the continuation of his actions, ſo provoke her, that ſome welbred Man coming to fall in love with in the time he played her ſuch pranks, ſhe might perhaps ſeek for in the ſweets of Love and in Vengeance, what ſhe would not have thought of in love alone; and thereupon being parted, I went home, and wrote this Letter to his Wife.</hi>

                           <hi>Six Months after</hi> Sevigny <hi>was killed in a Duel by the Chevalier</hi> d' Albert, <hi>his Wife ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inconſolable for his death; the reaſons ſhe had to hate him being known by all the World, they fancied that her grief was only feigned. For my part, who had more familiarity with her than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, I did not wait ſo long as they to ſpeak to her of agreeable things; and preſently after I made love to her, but without Ceremonies, and as if I had never done nothing elſe: She made me one of her Oracle anſwers, which Women make uſually in the beginning, that my Paſſion was ſo much at reſt, that it made me appear but little favourable, and perhaps it might be ſo, I know not. Tho Madam</hi> de Sevigny <hi>had no intention to love, it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to have more Complaiſance for her than I had in that Encounter. However, as I was her near Relation on the moſt honourable ſide, ſhe made me a thouſand proffers to be her Friend, and for my part, finding in her a ſort of Wit which diverted me, I was not ſorry to be ſo. I ſaw her almoſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day, I wrote to her, I made love to her after a raillying way, I fell out with my neareſt Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to ſerve with my Credit and Eſtate thoſe</hi>
                           <pb n="205" facs="tcp:61590:107"/>
                           <hi>perſons ſhe recommended to me. In ſhort, if ſhe had occaſion for all I have in the World, I ſhould have thought my ſelf extreamly obliged to her if ſhe would have given me an occaſion of aſſiſting her. As my Friendſhip was pretty like love, Madam</hi> de Sevigny <hi>was very well ſatisfied as long as I did not love elſewhere: but Chance, as I ſhall tell you in the Sequel, having made me fall in love with Madam</hi> de Preey, <hi>my Coſin, ſhe did not ſhow me ſo much affection as ſhe had done, when ſhe thought that I loved nothing but her. From time to time we had little quarrels, which indeed were made up, but which left in my heart, and I believe in here, ſuch ſeeds of Diviſion for the firſt occaſion we ſhould both have, and which were even capable to imbitter indifferent things. In ſhort, an occaſion being offered, wherein I had need of Madam</hi> de Sevigny, <hi>and wherein with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out her aſſiſtance I was in danger of loſing my Fortune, this ungrateful Woman abandoned me, and did me in Friendſhip the greateſt infidelity in the World. This, my Dear, made me fall out with her, and far from ſacrificing her to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> de Monglas, <hi>as was reported: This Lady whom I had long been in love with, hindred me from having all the reſentment which ſuch an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude deſerved. Buſſy</hi> having done ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Vivonne</hi> told him all that was ſaid of the Count <hi>de Lude,</hi> and of Madam <hi>de Sevigny; Was he ever much in her favour?</hi> Before I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer

to that, replyed <hi>Buſſy,</hi> it is neceſſary I give you an account of this Count <hi>de Lude.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>He has a little ugly Face, a great head of Hair, a fine Shape; he was not born to be ſat; but the fear of being incommode and diſagreable, makes him take ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary care to be lean, that at length he has ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected his deſign; his fine Shape has indeed coſt him ſomething of his health, he has ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſtomack in the Summer by the Dyets he has taken, and the Vinegar he has made uſe of. He is active on Horſeback, he dances and fences well, which is brave; he fought very well with <hi>Vardes,</hi> and they do him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, when they ſuſpect his Valour, the ground of this ſlander is, that all the Sparks of his Circumſtances, having ingaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the War, he would needs make one Campaign as a Voluntier; but the reaſon of this was, that he is idle, and loves his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures; In a word, he has Courage and no Ambition, he has a ſoft Wit, he is pleaſing with Women, he has ever been well uſed by them, but does not love them long; the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that he is ſo happy in their ſavours are, beſides the reputation he has of being ſecret, his good Meen, and his being well provided for love Engagements; but that which makes him ſo ſucceſsful every where is, that he cries when he will, and nothing perſwades Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:61590:108"/>
ſo much that we are in love as tears. However whether ſome miſchance has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to him in his intrigues, or that theſe who Envy ſay that it is his ſault they have no Children, he does not much diſhonour the Women he has to do with. Madam <hi>de Sevigny</hi> is one of thoſe for whom he has had a love; but his paſſion ending then when that fair one begun to make returnes to it; Thus Croſs accidents have ſaved her, their paſſions could never meet. And as he has ever viſited her ſince, tho without applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, it has occaſioned the report that he has had to do with her. And tho it is not true, there is great likehood it was ſo. He has however been the weakſide of Madam <hi>de Savigny,</hi> and the Man for whom ſhe has had the moſt inclination, notwithſtanding the jeaſts ſhe had made of it: this puts me in mind of a Song ſhe made wherein ſhe cauſes Madam <hi>de Sourdis</hi> who was with Child to ſpeak after this manner.</p>

The Ladies of <hi>Mong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, Precy</hi> and <hi>L' Iſle</hi> were very much friends and very lovely; but as perhaps we ſhould have been troubled to have agreed upon the the Choice, and that the Merit of thoſe Ladies was not ſo equall, that our inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould Carry us to love them equally, we agreed to make three tickets of their three names, and to put them into a purſe, and to keep to her that fate ſhould give us in drawing them.

did a favour to <hi>Feuillade</hi> which he knew not ſo well the value of as I did; but I was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to be contented with what ſhe had given me: And as I had ſeen Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> but five or ſix times, I fancyed that the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications I was going to make to Madam <hi>de Precy</hi> would efface out of my mind the beginning of a Paſſion.</p>

At firſt he found her a Woman, who without being too ſevere, ſeemed to him ſo natural an Enemy of Engagements, that he almoſt deſpaired of effecting his deſigns with her, or at leaſt of effecting them ſuddenly: Yet he was not quite diſencouraged, and ſometime after he found her more uncertain, and in ſhort he preſſed her ſo much, and ſeemed to her ſo much in love, that ſhe gave him leave to hope being beloved one day: But before I ſpeak further, it is convenient that I deſcribe to you Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> and <hi>Feuillade.</hi>

                  <p>Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> has little black ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Eys, an agreable Mouth, a Noſe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing turned up, fine white Teeth, a too lively Complexion, fine and delicate Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and a pleaſing turn of Countenance;
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:61590:110"/>
her Hair is black, long and thick; ſhe is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream neat, and the Air that comes from her is purer then that ſhe breathes; ſhe has the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Neck imaginable, her Arms and Hands delicately ſhaped, ſhe is neither great nor little, but of ſo eaſie a ſhape, that it will be ever agreable, if ſhe can ſave it from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency of too much fat. Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> has a quick and penetrating Wit, like her Complexion, even to exceſs; ſhe ſpeaks and writes with a ſurprizing Facility, and the moſt naturally imaginable; her thoughts are often diverted elſewhere in Converſation, and you cannot ſay to her things of ſo great Conſequence, as to take up all her attention; ſhe deſires you ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to tell her ſomething ſhe had then a mind to know; and as you begin your Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhe forgets her Curioſity, and the fire, ſhe is full of, makes her interrupt you to ſpeak of ſomething elſe.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> loves Muſick and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſhe makes very pretty ones her ſelf, ſhe ſings the beſt of any Woman in <hi>France,</hi> of her Quality; no Body dances better than ſhe, ſhe fears Solitude, ſhè is a true Friend, even to take the part of thoſe ſhe loves with indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, and to the very giving them all her Eſtate, if they have occaſion for it: She keeps their Secrets, religiouſly; ſhe knows
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:61590:111"/>
very well how to converſe with the World; ſhe is as Civil as a Woman of Quality ought to be: And tho ſhe is not willing to diſpleaſe any Body, her Civility has more of Pride than Flattery; for which reaſon ſhe does not gain hearts ſo ſoon as ſeveral others that are more inſinuating: But when they know her ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſtneſs, they apply themſelves much more earneſtly to her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>La Feuillade</hi> is not altogether for a Man what Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> is for a Woman; their Merits are different; he has however ſome falſe Charms, with which the weak are at firſt dazled, but which never deceives ſuch People as make Reflections; he has blew lively Eyes, a great Mouth, a ſhort Noſe, fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled Hair, and ſomething reddiſh; his Shape is pretty good, his Knees turn inwards, he has too much vivacity, he ſpeaks much, and will alway be pleaſant, but he does not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do what he has a mind to, that is to ſay, with civil Perſons, fancy to the populace and meaneſt Wits, with whom there needs no more than to have always the Mouth open to laugh orto ſpeak; he is admirable; he has a light wit, and a hard heart, even to ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; he is envious, and it is to him an affront, to be in proſperity; he is vain and haughty, and at his firſt coming to Court, he had ſo often told us that he was brave, that he made
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:61590:111"/>
a Conſcience of ſuſpecting it; however at preſent we make a Conſcience of believing it.</p>
                  <p>I have told you that Madam <hi>de Monglas</hi> being perſwaded that he had a violent Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for her, gave him hopes of being beloved. Any other than <hi>Feuillade</hi> would have made of this buſineſs the moſt agreable Intrigue i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginable; but he was lodged as I have told you, and only loved by ſtarts; he did enough to heat his Miſtreſs, and too little to engage her. When I told that fair One that he lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved her extreamly, becauſe that <hi>Feuillade</hi> had deſired me before her to ſpeak for him in his abſence, ſhe drolled upon me, and made me obſerve ſome parts of his procedure, which deſtroyed the good Offices I would have done him. I did not fail to excuſe him, &amp; not being able to ſave his Conduct, I juſtified at leaſt his intentions. We were much upon theſe terms, <hi>Darcy</hi> and I with the Ladies of <hi>Precy</hi> and <hi>L' Iſle,</hi> that is to ſay, they were willing that we ſhould love them, but indeed we did our Devoir better with them, than <hi>Feuillade</hi> did with Madam <hi>de Monglas;</hi> in ſhort, three Months being ſpent, during which that fair One found herſelf more en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by the things I had ſaid to her in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of <hi>Feuillade,</hi> than by the love he had ſhown her; this Lover was forced to go ſerve in the Army with a Regiment of Foot he
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:61590:112"/>
had. This Farewel made her ſenſible that ſhe had ſomething more kindneſs in her heart for <hi>la Feuillade</hi> then ſhe had thitherto belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; She let him perceive ſomething of it; but tho it was enough to render a welbred Man happy, it could not ſhock the ſevereſt Vertue. <hi>Feuillade</hi> at parting made her a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Proteſtations of loving her as long as he lived, tho ſhe ſhould even continue ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately reſolved not to make any returns to his Paſſion; and he and I preſſed her ſo much to give him leave to write to her, that ſhe gave her conſent.</p>
                  <p>Sometime before his departure, perceiving that the Commerce I had had for my Friend with his Miſtreſs, had the more touched my heart for her, in making me the better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with her, and that the efforts I had made to love Madam <hi>de Precy,</hi> had not cured me of my budding Paſſion for Madam <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gl as.</hi> I reſolved not to ſee her ſo often, that I might not be divided between Honour and Self-love. As long as <hi>Feuillade</hi> was at <hi>Paris,</hi> his Miſtreſs did not take notice that I did not viſit her ſo often as I uſed to do; but when he was gone, ſhe perceived a Change in my way of living, and this put her in pain, thinking that my retreat was a ſign of <hi>Feuil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade</hi>'s being become indifferent, and of whom likewiſe ſhe had not had any tidings ſince his
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:61590:112"/>
departure. Some days after having ſent to deſire me to come to her; <hi>What have I done to you, my Lord,</hi> ſaid ſhe to me, <hi>that I ſee you no oftner; has our Friendſhip any ſhare in your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence? No, Madam,</hi> ſaid I to her, <hi>it only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects my ſelf. How,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>have I given you any reaſon to Complain? No, Madam,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed I, <hi>I can only complain of Fortune.</hi> The diſorder with which I ſaid this, obliged her to preſs me to tell her more. <hi>How!</hi> added ſhe, <hi>do you conceal your Affairs from me, whom I let ſee all I have in my heart? if it be ſo I ſhould complain of you. Ah! how preſſing are you,</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered I her, <hi>is it diſcretion to force a Secret from ones Friend? ought not you to believe that I ſhould not tell you mine; ſince I do not tell it you in the Circumſtances I am in with you, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought not you to divine it, Madam, ſince—Ah! do not proceed,</hi> interrupted ſhe, <hi>I am afraid to underſtand you, I am afraid of having reaſon to be angry, and of loſing the eſteem I have for you: No, no, Madam,</hi> ſaid I to her, <hi>be not afraid, I am under thoſe Circumſtances you are not willing I ſhould be, and yet I ſhall not be wanting in my Devoir; but ſince we are come ſo far, I will tell you all the reſt: As ſoon as I ſaw you, Madam, I found you very amiable, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry time I ſaw you afterwards, I thought you more beautiful than the time before; however, I was not yet ſenſible of any thing ſo preſſing as to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige</hi>
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:61590:113"/>
                     <hi>me to follow you up and down, but I was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much pleaſed when I met with you. The firſt thing which made me perceive that I was in love with you, Madam, was the trouble your abſence gave me; and as I was upon the point of aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning my ſelf to my Paſſion, and of thinking of the means of making it known to you,</hi> Darcy, Feuillade, <hi>and I, drew lots, whom we ſhould each of us make our addreſs to, of you. Madam</hi> de Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>and Madam</hi> de L'Iſle, <hi>tho what my heart was ſenſible of for you, Madam, was yet very weak, I ſhould not have left to chance a thing of that Conſequence, if I had not been thitherto ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lucky; but in ſhort, my Fortune changed in that occaſion, for you fell to</hi> Feuillade<hi>'s ſhare, and I ſhould have gained more by having loſt all my life time, than in that unhappy moment, all my Comfort was, as I have ſaid, that the applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that I was going to make to Madam</hi> de Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, <hi>whom I had formerly loved, would root out of my heart what was budding there, but all to no purpoſe, Madam; you may judge that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce that the intereſt of my Friend obliged me to have with you, giving me the opportunity of knowing you more particularly, and of obſerving in you admirable principles for Love, I could not get rid of a Paſſion which your Beauty alone had produced, when</hi> Feuillade <hi>deſired me to ſerve him; I felt ſomething beyond the joy we have uſually in ſerving our Friends, and I quickly perceived</hi>
                     <pb n="217" facs="tcp:61590:113"/>
                     <hi>afterwards, that without deſigning to betray him, I was overjoyed with being concerned in his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, to have only the pleaſure of ſeeing you more nearly, but at length it put me into terrible pains; this, Madam, has obliged me to ſee you leſs fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and tho you did not take notice of it, but ſince</hi> Feuillade<hi>'s departure, it is above a fortnight ſince I retrenched my Viſits. Not but that you muſt have obſerved, Madam, that I have ſerved my Friend as I would have ſerved my ſelf, I have ſometimes justified him when he was apparently Culpable, and I might if I had had a mind, have ruined him with you without ſeeming unfaithful, leaving it to be done by the reſentment of a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Faults which you pretended he committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Love he ſhewed you. But I confeſs that my Duty makes me ſuffer extreamly in ſeeing you, and were I out of your ſight, it would spare me a great many efforts I make upon you my ſelf: beſides, Madam, I would never have told you the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of my retreat, if you had not asked me them. Nothing can be more civil, my Lord,</hi> Madam de Monglas replyed to me, <hi>than what you now do; but you ought to compleat your Duty, and ſend your Friend an account of all things; that he may not be ſurprized when he ſhall learn perhaps by other means, that you hardly ever ſee me, and that he may not to no purpoſe rely on your good Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to me:</hi> And thereupon Madam <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glas</hi> having cauſed Ink and Paper to be brought, I wrote this Letter.</p>

What gave me ſome Comfort in the Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of all the pains that an Amour without hopes is attended with, is that I was upon the Point of having the charge of Major Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Horſe, and that this Charge ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging me to go ſuddainly to the Army, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour would Cure me of an unfortunate paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Some days before my departure, I was willing to do divert the trouble I had through the violence I uſed upon my ſelf to Conceal my paſſion, and for that end I gave Madam <hi>de Savigny</hi> a very fine and extraordinary treat which you will certeinly be well pleaſed to have the deſcription of.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, ſigure to your ſelf in the Gardon of the Temple which you know, a Wood, wherein two Allyes croſs in the place they meet, there was a great Oval of Trees, on whoſe Branches a hundred Chriſtal Candle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticks were tyed; on one ſide of this Oval was a magnificent Theater raiſed, whoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coration well deſerved to be ſo lighted as it was, and the luſtre of a thouſand Wax Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles, which the leaves of the Trees hindred from ſpreading, rendred ſo bright a light in that part, that the Sun could not have given more, and for the ſame reaſon all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout was ſo obſcure that your Eys were of no uſe: The Calmeſt Night imaginable; as ſoon as the Play was begun it was found very

pleaſant: After this Divertiſement, four and twenty Violins having played a Conſort, played likewiſe Brawls, Courants, and Country Dances; the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny was not ſo great as it was well choſen; ſome dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, others looked upon the Dancers, and others, whoſe Intrigues were more forward, walked with their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes in the Allyes, where they ſported without ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another. This laſted till day, and as if Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven had acted in Concert with me, the morning began to appear when the light went out: This Feat ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded ſo well, that Letters were ſent to all places of the particulars of it, and it is ſtill talked of with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration; ſome fantied that Madam <hi>de Sevigny</hi> was in that Occaſion only the Pretext of Madam <hi>de Precy;</hi> but the truth was, I gave that Treat to Madam <hi>de Monglas,</hi> without daring to tell her ſo; and I believe that ſhe ſuſpected, without letting me know her thoughts. In the mean time I toyed with her before people, I was ever ſaying to her a thouſand kind things in a drolling way; and I made this Song to Sarabrand Tune, which you have certainly heard Sung.</p>

                  <p>You may judge, that having theſe Sentiments for Madam <hi>de Monglas,</hi> my Addreſſes to Madam <hi>de Precy,</hi> were not very extraordinary: I lived with her with the greateſt caſe imaginable, and my little eagerneſs ſuted extreamly well with her lukewarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
