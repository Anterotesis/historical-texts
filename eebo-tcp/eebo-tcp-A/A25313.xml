         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Papiſts have of late given us ſuch freſh Occaſions by their horrid and damnable Conſpiracies againſt the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of our King, our Government, and our Religion; to renounce and deteſt the Communion of that Church, which does not only allow men, but teaches them to be Murderers and Traytors. And we have yet ſo great Reaſon to apprehend the diſmal Conſequences of their Secret and Helliſh Machinations, that I am confident no Diſcourſe which tends to heighten and improve the juſt Prejudices of <hi>Engliſh men,</hi> againſt that impious and abſurd Religion, will be thought at this time unneceſſary by any good Proteſtant. I ſhall not therefore make any Apology for the Collecting and Printing this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitome of the three great Maſſacres in <hi>Piedmont, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is intended chiefly for the Inſtruction of ignorant and unlearned People; for we fear not that Scholars and men of Sence ſhould be made Papiſts, except ſuch whoſe Morals are ſo wretchedly debauch'd, that they are ready at all times to ſacrifice their Conſciences to their Civil Intereſts: and I hope there are not ſo many of theſe deſperate Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes as the Papiſts are apt to imagine, and as the Manners of the Age we live in, may (I confeſs) give us juſt cauſe to fear: No, 'tis the ordinary Rank of men, who have not had the Advantage of Learning and a generous Education, to defend themſelves againſt the ſtudied Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:66369:4"/>
and ſpecious pretences of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Agents, who commonly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the Prey of thoſe <hi>Wolves in Sheeps cloathing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To provide therefore for their Security, that they may not fall into the ſnares that are laid for them, ought to be our chiefeſt Care, ſince as 'tis more Charity to ſtrengthen the hands of the weak, than to add force to the ſtrong; ſo in this caſe, 'tis more prudent too, in order to the ſupport of the common cauſe of Proteſtant Religion, the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant being by far the greater number. Nor is this to be done a better way, then by furniſhing them with ſuch plain Arguments as they are able to apprehend and manage themſelves, to the confuſion of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Enemy. And theſe can be no other than ſuch as are drawn from matters of Fact, they being eaſieſt to be underſtood, and hardeſt to be anſwer'd.</p>
            <p>For this Reaſon it was, that this ſhort Narrative of the bloody But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries and inhumane Murders heretofore committed upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Proteſtants, by <hi>Italian, French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh</hi> Papiſts, in cold blood, and by the Inſtigation of their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Church, was prepared for the Preſs at the deſire of a worthy Gentleman, (whoſe Zeal for the Intereſt of his Country and the Proteſtant Religion deſerves a publick mention, would his Modeſty permit it) in order to the being by him beſtow'd among his Country Neighbours, who, ſome of them perhaps have never heard of, and others may have forgot the Story of theſe holy Popiſh Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, theſe religious Villanies; the deſign being to let ſuch ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſee, what a horrid thing Popery is, when her Verniſh is taken off; what a deform<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d and frightful face this gaudy painted whore, <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 2, 5, 6.</note> 
               <hi>With whom the Kings of the earth have committed Fornication, this Mother of Abominations, made drunk with the blood of the Saints, and with the blood of the Martyrs of Jeſus;</hi> I ſay, What a deform'd and frightful face ſhe has when her Paint is laid by, and ſhe appears by true Lights in her proper Colours: What mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous and abominable Actions Papiſts are capable of, when the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of that Idol of theirs (their Church) requires them. By which as well as by their late Plots here in <hi>England,</hi> 'tis not hard for men of the meaneſt Capacities to perceive, That their Religion cannot be the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Chriſt, while it juſtifies them in the groſſeſt Immoralities, and engages them in the moſt unchriſtian Practices. That thoſe deteſtable Doctrines of <hi>Depoſing and Killing Kings, and extirpating Hereticks,</hi> which have been ſo often objected to the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> by Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Divines, are not <hi>Speculative Notions and Propoſitions Proble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical,</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:66369:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
as ſome of the Popiſh Writers, and particularly the Author of that lying Libel, called <note n="*" place="margin">Compend. pag. 77.</note> 
               <hi>The Compendium,</hi> would make us believe; But ſuch ſettled Maxims of their barbarous Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Policy, as too often have been, and again will be put in practice, whenever that proud uncharitable Church has a ſafe occaſion to do it; though at other times they muſt be diſown'd with the uſual Popiſh Impudence, eſpecially to ſuch Proteſtants as have ſo little wit to take what they ſay on Truſt, or ſo little Reading not to be able to diſprove them.</p>
            <p>I hope no man will underſtand me here, as if from the bare Actions of Papiſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and nothing elſe, I argued to the Principles of Popery, and conclude the one from the other; this were bad Charity, and worſe Logick, and one of their own conſtant Topicks in their Writings againſt Proteſtants: 'twere (to ſay the worſt that can be of it) to fall direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the ridiculous way of Reaſoning uſed by the <hi>Compendianist,</hi> when he pretends to anſwer the Bp. of <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s Book, that admirable and learned Diſcourſe; a Diſcourſe of ſo great uſe at this time, and which does with ſuch undeniable Evidence convince the Religion of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts to be guilty of all their traiterous and bloody Deſigns againſt Kings and Proteſtants, that I cannot but take this occaſion to correct that troubleſome Impertinent, who has made ſuch a ſenceleſſe Buzze, and rais'd ſuch a duſt about it, with deſign to puzzle and darken thoſe Truths, which the Biſhop has there made ſo plain and clear, eſpecially ſince the Biſhop himſelf has not thought him (as indeed he is not) wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of his Notice, and no body elſe that I know off, has yet expos'd that part of his impudent Pamphlet, which concerns this truly Venerable and Excellent Perſon.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, what a fooliſh Flouriſh dos he make againſt the Biſhop, endeavouring to throw that wicked Principle of <hi>Depoſing Kings</hi> upon Proteſtants, with this groſſe Fallacy of Arguing from mens Practices to the Principles of their Religion? <hi>Is not his Lordſhips meaning,</hi> ſays <note n="*" place="margin">Compend. pag. 77.</note> he, <hi>in truth this, that Protestant Principles (when really believ'd) are destructive to all Kings, eſpecially to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick ones? ſince we ſee that the lawful Monarchs of England, Scotland, Swaedland, Denmark, the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces, Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, Geneva, &amp;c. have been actually depos'd by their Protestant Subjects.</hi> This (&amp;c.) here I gueſſe to be a Lye of the loweſt price in their Book of Rates for Sin; tis ſo pitifull and inconſiderable a trick. He puts it down, as if there were a vaſt and tireſome number of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:66369:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
behind, which in kindneſs to his Reader he forbears to mention, where Princes have been depos'd by Proteſtants; when he knew in his Conſcience he could ſcarce have nam'd one more, if it had been to gain the Popedom; if he could, I doubt not but we ſhould have had it at full length. Well; but in thoſe Countries he has nam'd, <hi>Princes (it ſeems) have been actually depoſed by their Protestant Subjects.</hi> And what then? Does it therefore follow, that the Proteſtant Religion tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the Doctrine of Depoſing Kings? Or, may it not indeed teach the quite contrary for all that? Did this wretched Trifler never hear of men who have acted contrary to the Principles of their Religion? where has he liv'd? In a Convent without doubt, among the moſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphick Saints of his Church; <note n="*" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet</hi>'s Fanaticiſme of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> pag. 276.</note> I mean thoſe mad Fanatickes of the Sect of Abbot <hi>Joachim,</hi> who according to their New <hi>Evangelium Aeternum,</hi> have been in a ſtate of Perfection ever ſince the year 1260. I wonder when his hand was in, and while he was induſtriouſly ſtuffing out his thin Diſcourſe with bigge and ſounding words, he did not bring all the Proteſtant Criminals, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ill men, who have been any way Famous ſince the Reformation, upon the ſtage, and then charge the Proteſtant Religion with Felony, and Murder, and Treaſon, and Adultery, and Perjury, and what not? The Conſequence had been altogether as good, and the Triumph as juſt. We do not reaſon at this looſe and abſurd Rate, when we accuſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of Principles which juſtifie the <hi>Depoſing and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of Princes,</hi> and the Maſſacre of Millions of innocent People, whom with a ridiculous affectation ſhe terms Hereticks. But we firſt prove her (as my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Lincolae</hi> has unanſwerably done) to have ſuch Principles; and this not only from the Books of her moſt eminent Writers, upon whoſe Teſtimony we always lay the leaſt weight) allow'd and commended by her ſelf, but from that Law which is the Rule of Juſtice in her Eccleſiaſtical Courts, from the Authentick Bulls and Decretals of her Popes, and laſtly (which is the greateſt Evidence that is poſſible in the caſe) from the Cannons of her general Councils. Then we urge matters of Fact, conformable to them, to ſhew that they are not things of bare Speculation and diſpute am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To come to particulars: We ſhould not lay to her Charge the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:66369:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Murders of <hi>Henry</hi> III. and <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of <hi>France,</hi> becauſe they were committed by Members of her Communion, if (beſides the publick Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe of the one by the then Pope, in a Set-ſpeech to the Colledg of Cardinals) we had not firſt convinc'd her of holding ſuch Principles as juſtify both. We ſhould not accuſe her of the ſeveral Conſpiracies of Papiſts here in <hi>England</hi> againſt the Lives of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> King <hi>James,</hi> King <hi>Charles I.</hi> and his preſent Majeſty, if (beſides the proving upon her the before-mention'd Principles) ſhe had not actually and formally (as far as it lay in her Power) Excommunicated and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd them all, and abſolv'd their Subjects from their Oaths of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance. We ſhould not accuſe her of the Maſſacres of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont,</hi> becauſe her Sons were there the <hi>Brethren in Iniquity, the Sons of Violence,</hi> that acted unprovok'd thoſe diſmall Slaughters, if, as an additional proof of her holding the before-mention'd Principles, ſhe had not <note n="a" place="margin">Thuanus <hi>Hiſt. l.</hi> 53. <hi>p.</hi> 837.</note> commended the one, giving thanks to God for it, and <note n="b" place="margin">Hiſtory of the <hi>Waldenſes.</hi>
               </note> commanded the other. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, we ſhould not place to her Account the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion of <hi>Ireland,</hi> and all thoſe murders which were the conſequences of it, becauſe the Rebels were Papiſts, it (beſides that the <note n="c" place="margin">Hiſtory of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Rebellon, printed 1680.</note> Pope's Nuncio was known to be the chief Guid, and <hi>Romiſh</hi> Prieſts the chief Contrivers and Fomenters of that deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and bloody Revolt) it were not moſt notorious, that ſhe has alwayes ready an Armory of execrable Principles, ſuited to ſuch occaſions, to ſatisfy the Conſciences and encourage the Madneſs of her <hi>Jewiſh Zealots.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I am confident all impartial men will judge fair Dealing and juſt diſcourſe, and far different from the Method of the <hi>Compendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nist;</hi> the Reader may ſee we ground not our Charge of Popery upon the bare Actions of Papiſts, but having found this degenerate Church teaching the moſt diſloyal and inhumane Doctrines; and then obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her followers in ſeveral famous Inſtances, to be guilty of Facts which directly anſwer to them: We think we have reaſon to conclude the one to be the cauſe of the other, and that many Papiſts had not been ſo bad men, if their very Religion had not debauch'd them.

Propoſitions equivalent, or at leaſt equivalent as to the point in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie between him and the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and that they equally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace the profeſs'd Religion of him who affirms them. He cannot ſure be ſo void of the ordinary reaſon of a Man, though he has ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd down never ſo many Roman Catholick Doctrines, as not to perceive a palpable difference between them. 'Tis not but that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe Poſitions is a very bad Principle, dangerous to Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and deſtructive to the Peace and Settlement of a Nation, though not ſo much as the latter, becauſe it wants the Enforcement of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Religion to fix it in the Mind, and thruſt it out upon occaſion into action with that Violence, which uſually accompanies a pretended Zeal for the Honour of God. But how bad ſoever it may be ſtill 'tis a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, not a Religious Principle; and though it may be Sedition in the higheſt degree, it can never be Hereſie; a mans Life and Eſtate (who maintaines it) is anſwerable for it, not his Religion. To make this a little clearer, I ſay, 'Tis one thing to hold, That Princes may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>depos'd by the State, though upon the Account of Religion, <hi>(i. e.</hi> for being of a Religion different from the eſtabliſh'd) grounding this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion upon the Laws and Cuſtoms of ſome particular Civil Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or upon the ends of Government in general; and quite another thing to hold, that they may be depos'd by the Church, grounding this Opinion upon the Laws of Religion, and a Power ſuppos'd to be dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated to her by Chriſt. This laſt is the Principle we charge, and the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> has prov'd upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which makes her Religion it ſelf dangerous to Princes. On the other ſide, though <hi>Luther, Calvin,</hi> or any other Proteſtant Divines ſhould hold the firſt, though it be a falſe and a bad, yet (as I ſaid before) 'tis a Civil Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, and their holding it could no more reflect on the Proteſtant Religion, than an Error they might be guilty of in Hiſtory or Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks. The Proteſtant Religion therefore remaines clear from any ſuſpicion of allowing the Doctrine of <hi>Depoſing Princes</hi> (the point I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to make good) though it ſhould be granted the <hi>Compendianiſt,</hi> that <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> &amp;c. have had ill Principles in Relation to Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Governments. If he could prove indeed, That <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> or any other Proteſtant Divines have held <hi>The Lawfulneſs of Depoſing Princes,</hi> as a Principle of their Religion, and plac'd the power of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it the Church, he would ſay ſomething that were to the purpoſe, and parallel to what we accuſe the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> off, but in the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod he has taken, he does but beat the Air, and fight with Shadows.</p>

I ſhall explain this Diſtinction a little further by ſome famous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, in order to meet with the other Cavils of this idle wrangler, and make the Inconſequence of his Arguings (if it be poſſible) yet more apparent. He may remember then, That here in <hi>England, Edward</hi> the II. and <hi>Richard</hi> the II. were <hi>actually</hi> depos'd in times of Popery, and by Papiits; yet did our Writers never charge the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> (though ſhe held then the ſame doctrines, and had the ſame Pride to trample on Princes that now ſhe has) with thoſe two diſloyal and unjuſt Uſurpations upon the Sovereignty of the Kings of <hi>England.</hi> And for what imaginable reaſon but this only, <hi>viz.</hi> becauſe they were both acts of the Civil Power, and carried on by men who grounded what they did upon Principles (though groſly falſe and miſtaken) drawn from the Conſtitution of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Government, and the Rights of the two Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Parliament; and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> contrary to her Cuſtom upon ſuch occaſions, was only a bare Spectator, neither her Authority nor her Principles being made uſe of to further or juſtifie thoſe procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. I would now a k this Collector of Impertinences, this teadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Compendianiſt,</hi> whether he thinkes this a good reaſon to clear the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> from being concern'd in the depoſing of theſe two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Princes. If he ſayes, Tis, as no doubt he will, with what face can he pretend to charge the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (as he would be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to do, <hi>pag.</hi> 76 <hi>lin.</hi> 38.) with the Endeavours that were us'd to keep Queen <hi>Mary</hi> from the Crown, the Death of the Queen of <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Bill of the late Houſe of Commons againſt the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſince the Caſes are directly parellel; I mean parallel in all that concernes the preſent Queſtion. Were they not every one of the Acts of the Civil Power, and carried on by men who grounded what they did on Civil, not Religious Principles; Was not the ſetting up of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lady <hi>Jane Grey,</hi> and the raiſing an Army to oppoſe Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> an Act of the Privy Council in perſuance of King <hi>Edward's</hi> Will, and a Law made in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. for the Illegitimating of this Princeſs, as the Lords of the Council themſelves declare in their Anſwer to her Letter writ from <note n="*" place="margin">

               <hi>Framingham Castle?</hi> Was not the Death of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> moſt notoriouſly an act of the State, and juſtified by the Laws of the Land?

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:66369:7"/>
Have not all the Pamphlets that have been writ in Vindication of that Bill argued the Lawfulneſſe of it from the Conſtitution of the Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and wholly diſclaim'd the Intereſting of Religion at all in the buſineſſe, as to the juſtifying of it in the leaſt degree, endeavouring with great paines to prove, That true Religion does not meddle with the Civil Rights of Princes, but leaves them to be determin'd by the Laws and Cuſtoms of particular Countries? By what ſtrange conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence then can he entitle the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or the Proteſtant Religion, to things that are ſo perfectly of a Civil nature, unleſs he will make them anſwerable for all the Actions of Proteſtants of what kind ſoever, and reſolve to maintaine that childiſh <hi>Sophiſme</hi> I firſt took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, as the chief ground of all his extravagant Raving againſt the Biſhops Book, <hi>viz. The concluding the Principles of a Religion from the Practices of her Profeſſors?</hi> Which is the very Dregs of Folly, the laſt Running of Impertinence.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the Proteſtant Religion <hi>(i. e.</hi> the care of preſerving it) was, no doubt, the great Motive of doing what was done in every one of theſe three Caſes, but that is not here to the purpoſe; for, 'tis not the Reaſon for which, but the Authority by which, a Prince is depos'd, and the kind of Principle <hi>(i.e.</hi> whether Civil, or Religious) 'tis juſtifi'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that muſt condemn, or acquit a Church of the Guilt of it; though this man endeavour all along to inſinuate the contrary, by ſuch a falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious way of repreſenting the Poſition charg'd on the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> as makes that ſeem to be the chief Point in the Controverſy between her and the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> which is in truth no part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Motive or end of depoſing Princes.</hi> But 'tis not the Buſineſſe of this little Pamphleter to ſtate things fairly, and reaſon clearly, but to amuſe the Reader, and puzzle the Queſtion; a cloſe way of arguing will not ſuit either with his Cauſe or his Underſtanding: a good proof of which he gives us at the very firſt, in theſe words; <note n="*" place="margin">See the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend.</hi> pag. <hi>76.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>If on the other-ſide</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>the Biſhop means that there have been Popiſh Doctors of the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, That Princes might be Depos<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>d upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Religion, what Advantage, I would fain know, can that be to his Lordſhip, or his Treatiſe, ſince not only all the Prime Leaders of the Reformation,</hi> &amp;c. Is it to be imagin'd now, that a man ſhould get ſo far out of his way, unleſs he purpoſely deſign'd to ramble, or write things ſo grosſly impertinent to the matter he was treating of; unleſs he ſtudyed to confound it, and render it as little intelligible as was poſſible? This is properly playing at Croſs Purpoſes (which he very fooliſhly, and very unjuſtly accuſes the Biſhop off) when men talk
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:66369:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what is foreign to the Queſtion and wander from the buſineſs out of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne. Never did any man take more true pains to underſtand a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe difficult in it ſelf, than he has to miſunderſtand the Biſhop's, which was plain and eaſy, or at leaſt to make his Reader do ſoe; for he cannot be ſoe dull himſelf in this point as he would ſeem. 'Tis not poſſible that he, or any man who has read the Biſhop's Book, ſhould think, it was the Biſhop's meaning only to charge the popiſh Doctors with holding indefinitely, <hi>That Princes might be Depos'd upon the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Religion,</hi> when 'tis ſo palpably evident in a hundred places of his Book, that he only brings their Opinions as a collateral proof of his Charge of their Church and Religion, and that with a quite different Tenet, as I have already ſhow'd. And as 'tis the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> and not the Doctors, only, or chiefly, which the Biſhop charges with holding, <hi>that Princes may be Depos'd by her Authority, not with holding indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely that they may be Depos'd upon the account of Religion:</hi> So 'tis the preſent popiſh Canon-Law, the Bulls and Decretals of Popes, and the Canons of General Councils, which are the Teſtimonies he relies upon for the making good of his Charge, and not the private Opinions of Popiſh Doctors, though being cited out of Books licens'd and approv'd by that Church, they are of conſiderable weight in the Argument. Now what ſayes the <hi>Compendianist</hi> to theſe ſtrong and moſt convincing Proofs? <hi>Why in fine (as Mr.</hi> Bayes <hi>ſayes upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion) he wont tell us.</hi> He has not one word, not one Syllable of Anſwer to them, but paſſes them over with as deep a ſilence, and as good a grace, as if they were, like moſt of his own, not at all to the purpoſe. This diſcreet and neceſſary Reſolution being taken, he bends all his little Wit, and with a great deal of Chearfulneſſe goes about to invalidate what the Biſhop urges from the Writings of the Popiſh Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, which yet the poor impotent Scribler is by no means able to do; as I have made appear in my Anſwer to his Charge of <hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin.</hi> The Attempt however was juſt as wiſe, and as likely to ſatisfy reaſonable men, as if a General, who had a great and well diſciplin'd Army to fight with, ſhould neglect the Main Body, and with his whole ſtrength ſet upon the Forlorn Hope.</p>
            <p>Before I proceed any farther, I cannot but take Notice of a very extraordinary Paſſage, which I meet with, pag. 77. li. 12. Where the Compendianiſt would make the World believe, That we our ſelves confeſs, That our Monarchy is weaken'd by our Religion; That Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery

muſt be call'd back to ſupport it, and that Papiſts are hated by many on this Account, all which is in it ſelfe ſo notorious a Falſehood, and in him (who could not but know the contrary) ſo baſe a Slander of the Proteſtant Faith in general, and of the People of <hi>England</hi> in particular, that I am confident no true Proteſtant can read it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Indignation, nor any ſenſible man without Aſtoniſhment at the ſtrange Impudence of this proſtitute Writer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His Words are theſe: <hi>Can it be ſaid, That the Monarchy has gotten by the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, when Protestants themſelves acknowledge (and what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate Enemies that has created us, may be eaſily imagin'd) that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but Popery, or at least its Principles, can make it again emerge, or laſting?</hi> Was there ever ſuch a complication of Malice and Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as this Period affords us? There is a veine of impertinent arguing, contrary to the known Rules of Diſcourſe, and ſhameleſſe affirming, contrary to the knowne Truth of Fact, which runs through the whole Maſſe of his crude and indigeſted Pamphlet: But this is a Nompare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>illo (to uſe Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

'Tis uſual with him to tell Tales for Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and lay down confident Aſſertions in ſtead of Proofs: but let him now rake together all the Dirt he can meet with, and practiſe himſelf in Compendiums, <hi>i. e.</hi> in lamentable ill reaſon'd, lying Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes; Let him make Extracts of the Lives of popiſh Saints, and abridge the Legends of Monks; let him take ſhort Heads of Mr. <hi>Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy</hi>'s <hi>Mystical Divinity</hi> in his <hi>Sancta Sophia,</hi> and write Epitomes of the Controverſies of the Schoolmen, he ſhall never again be able to crowd ſo much Nonſence, Libel, and Untruth into ſo few Words, as long as he lives. <hi>Can it be ſaid</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>That the Monarchy has gotten by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> &amp;c?) Prodigious Impudence! Can any thing elſe be ſaid with the leaſt colour of Reaſon, or Truth? He cannot but know too, that this has alwayes been ſaid by Proteſtant Writers, and prov'd beyond all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, except that of abſurd and illogical men, from whom Saint <hi>Paul</hi> pray'd to be delivered. However ſince he will needs make a New Queſtion of it, I ſhall take this occaſion to inform the ignorant Reader (for none elſe can need it) how much the Monarchy has got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by the Reformation in point of Civil Advantage, and conſequently, how great a Loſer it will be every way, if by ſome fatal Infatuation, any Succeſſor of his Majeſty ſhould again bring the Crown, and the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under the Romiſh Yoke, that worſe than Aegyptian Darkneſſe, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:66369:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Slavery, which neither our Fathers, nor We are able to beare.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place the, The Monarchy has by the Reformation, gotten an abſolute Freedom from the Tyranny of the Popes Spiritual Supremacy, and his pretended Temporal Power <hi>in ordine ad Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualia,</hi> to which it was before ſubject, and in perſuance of which ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of our Kings have been ſummon'd to appear perſonally at <hi>Rome,</hi> and King <hi>John</hi> forc'd to reſigne his Crowne to a Legate, to the high Diſhonour of the Regal Majeſty, and the apparent Prejudice of that Reverence it ought to have in the mindes of the People: Nay further, all that Part of the Pope's Spiritual Power, which was either Neceſſary, or uſeful for the Government of the Church, is, by the Reformation, become the King's, ſo that no Authority but God Almighty's is now above him, nor any in <hi>England</hi> independent of him. He is equally Head both of the Church &amp; the State: No Appeales can be made from his Courts, nor any ſort of Perſons priviledg'd from his Juſtice; In a word, He is no longer a Feauditary Vaſſall to the Popes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as in effect all Popiſh Princes are; ſince the Pope has an allow'd Right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand them in whatever he will call Spirituall, or will ſay has any relation to Spiritual Matters, and by declaring them Hereticks, he can (according to the Romiſh Religion) depoſe them, and deſtroy them when he pleaſes. Now the being deliver'd from ſuch a low, unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Servitude, and the acquiring ſuch a large Increaſe both of Honour, and Power is certainly no ſmall addition to the Monarchy, yet this it has gotten purely by the Reformation.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Monarchy has by the Reformation gotten a greater Security than it had before, both for the King's Perſon, and his Crowne; thoſe Helliſh Papal Doctrines, which I have been hitherto diſcourſing off, did, in times of Popery, perpetually hang over their Heads, like <hi>Damocles</hi>'s Sword, ready to doe Execution upon the leaſt irregular Motion, and they were neither of them any longer ſafe than the Pope pleas'd. But ſince the Reformation, the Popes Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications, and Bulls of Depoſition are of no Force, and can have little effect in <hi>England;</hi> ſome they will have while Papiſts are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to live among us, and, by enjoying Eſtates, to have an Intereſt in the Kingdom, as the preſent popiſh PLOT does but too plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove, however by many degrees leſs than if Popery were
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:66369:9"/>
again the eſtabliſh'd Religion; ſo that I ſay, The King of <hi>England</hi> has by meanes of the Proteſtant Religion, at leaſt a greater Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for his Life, and his Crown, than he had before, an abſolute one he muſt not expect while he has any popiſh Subjects.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Monarchy has by the Reformation gotten to the King of <hi>England,</hi> the Government of all Engliſh men, of what Order or Profeſſion ſoever, which heretofore he had not, the Cier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy being exempt from the Civil Juriſdiction, and depending chiefly on the Pope (who beſtow'd moſt of the Biſhopricks; and great Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices) both for Protection and Preferment: the King had little power either to puniſh or reward them, as the Hiſtoryes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of thoſe times do ſufficiently demonſtrate. But 'tis notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly knowne to what a degree the Reformation has alter'd the ſtate of things in that point, and how much the Intereſts of Clergy men do now tye them, more than others, to the Service of the Crowne, as alſo how well they undeſtand, and how zealouſly they purſue thoſe Intereſts, whenas heretofore they were the conſtant Raiſers of Factions againſt their Princes, in favour of <hi>Rome,</hi> and obſtinate maintainers of the Pope's Encroachments upon their Regal Rights. Nay, the Laity themſelves were the Pope's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in Spiritual matters, and for the moſt Part, wholely guided by their Prieſts, the Pope's Dependants (by Reaſon of the great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand they had over their Conſciences) in their Civil concernes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo; Soe that the King under theſe and other circumſtances of Popery was but a Servant to the Church, and little more in Effect than the Popes Vice-Roy. But the Reformation has freed both him, and his people from this baſe, diſhonorable Subjection, aud moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenient Dependance on a foreign Power.</p>
            <p>Theſe are things which all the World muſt acknowledge to be very conſiderable in themſelves, and very great acquiſitions to the Monarchy, yet are they ſuch as have naturally, and neceſſarily fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into it upon the eſtabliſhment of Proteſtant Religion in the room of Popery, and that too, as 'tis this particular form of Government call'd a Monarchy, diſtinguiſh'd from all other Kindes; if I ſhould take notice of the Advantages it has receiv'd by this change, as 'tis a Civil Government, in general, I might obſerve many more; as firſt,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:66369:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
an Increaſe of the Trade, and conſequently of the Riches, of the Kingdom, as well by the taking away that vaſt number of unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, ſenceleſſe Holydaies, impos'd on the People by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which muſt needs be a great hinderance to the carrying on of publick Buſineſs, and Commerce, as by the application of many Thouſands of Perſons to the waies, and means of raiſing a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to maintain themſelves, who were heretofore maintain'd, and liv'd wholely, like idle Drones, upon the labour and induſtry of others, and by being ſhut up in a Cloyſter, and ſequeſtred from the common Employments of other men, were made every way uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Members of the State, and a burden to it. Secondly, Another advantage the Monarchy (conſider'd in the general as a body Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick) has receiv'd by this Change, is an Increaſe of the Strength, and Safety of the Kingdom, by the great Increaſe of People (which alſo alwayes increaſes Trade) ſince the Clergy have been allow'd to marry, and the Folly of Monkery and Vowes of pepetual Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libacy (as they call it) in either Sex has been both forbidden and ſcorn'd.</p>
            <p>'Twere eaſy for me to enlarge upo this Argument, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhew, how friendly an Inſtitution, and how highly ſerviceable the Proteſtant Religion, when rightly underſtood, is to the Civil In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, both of this and all other Kingdomes and States as well by the great gentleneſs, and moderation of her external Diſcipline; as by the peaceable temper, and Loyalty of her Doctrines: And that on the other ſide Popery does not only make the Prince himſelf a Dependant, and unſafe, but his people few, ignorant and poor; She robbes him firſt of his Authority, and then of his Subjects; her Monaſteries decoy the zealous, her Inquiſitions drives away the wiſe, and both together enſlave and beggar the fooliſh <hi>Iſſachars,</hi> that ſtay behend, <hi>to bow down their ſervile ſhoulders to the Burden</hi> of an oppreſſive Government. But I think what I have already diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd is more than enough to prove the preſent Point, <hi>viz<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That the Monarchy of England has gotten by the Reformation,</hi> and that no body, but a man, who either underſtands not, or cares not what he ſayes, would affirm the contrary.</p>
            <p>The Compendianiſt, poſſibly, may here object, as he ſeemes to do, <hi>pag.</hi> 77. lib 9. That popiſh Princes abroad are not ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of theſe Inconveniences in their Religion, nor do they perceive

any ſuch ill Conſequences to ariſe from the Profeſſion of it, as the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi>'s Book, and this Preface charges it with, but alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether the contrary; <hi>For, Who</hi> (ſayes He) <hi>find themſelves ſo flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing, and great as they?</hi> I ſuppoſe he ſpeaks this of the French King (for I know no other popiſh Prince that is at preſent, either flouriſhing, or great) and if he means that Popery has been the cauſe of his Greatneſs, I ſhall not diſpute it with him, but this, I will affirme, and maintaine againſt all the World, That 'twas nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his owne Popery, nor that of his Subjects; though every Body knows the French Popery is much gentler, and more converſeable ſort of thing than the Spaniſh, or Italian: more plyant, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive to the Civil Magiſtrate, and more hoſpitable to Strangers, and Diſſenters, and conſequently leſſe prejudicial to the growth of Power, and the greatneſs of a State than the other. The Priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church, and the Doctrines of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the manners of the people, and the Excluſion of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition, have a little qualified this pernicious Impoſture; and temper'd the Malignity of her Influence; as the moſt deſtructive Plants do ſometimes loſe the Virulence of their poiſons by a change of Soyle, and <hi>Mercury</hi> it ſelfe, by a mixture of Ingredients, is ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred innocent Phyſick I grant therefore that Popery in ſome places, and under ſome Circumſtances of alloy, may not abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hinder, but it can never be the cauſe, nor of it ſelf, in any degree contribute to, the proſperity of either Prince, or people; for 'tis plaine, That the Principles it teaches, and the Conſequences it draws after it, do evidently tend (as I have already made appear) to the leſſening of the one, and the impoveriſhing of the other, indeed to the ruine of both; and if Popery have not at all times, and in all Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſo bad an effect, it muſt be attributed to ſome ſuch cauſes as I have now mention'd, which do in <hi>France,</hi> ſerve to take out the ſting of this monſtrous beaſt, this Spawn of <hi>the Old Serpent,</hi> and prevent the Miſchiefe, which it is otherwiſe ſo apt to doe, the Blaſt it would infallibly bring upon the ordinary fruites of good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the common ends of Civil Societies. To conclude this point, if any Prince or State happen (by ſome favorable conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, and fortunate Accidents) to be great with, or, rather not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, Popery, there is no doubt but they would be either of them, much greater without it.</p>

'Tis now left to the Reader to judge, upon a due conſiderat i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Whole, what an excellent Engine this Popery would prove to buoy up a ſinking Monarchy, and make it again <hi>emerge</hi> (as the Compendianiſt calls it in his pedantical <hi>Latin</hi> phraſe) were ours in that deſperate low condition to need it, which I hope 'tis far from, or, if it do at preſent decline, I am ſure no man in his right wits, except this Author, will ſay, 'tis for want of Popery. What kind of men are thoſe Proteſtants then, who (if we may take the Compendia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſt's own word for it) would recommend to his Majeſty, in a caſe of extremity, this dry antiquated Drugge, this uſeleſſe Lump of Formality, and Foppery, this diſcover'd Cheat, this Inſulter and Braver of Crown'd Heads, this Uſurper upon the Rights of Princes, this Enemy to <hi>God's Annointed.</hi> I ſay what kind of Creatures muſt theſe be? They are certainly a Species by themſelves, and have not the ſame common Faculties, and wayes of underſtanding with other Chriſtian people; if at leaſt there be any ſuch, which I will not be overpoſitive in, upon the Authority of this Writer; for ſome of his ſtories are as unlikely (to uſe his own words about the Plot) <hi>as any Romance Extant.</hi> But Proteſtants does he term them? It is impoſſible! Why will he abuſe his Friends at this Rate, and call them out of their Names? I'll warrant them they are as good Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks as himſelf. Does he indeed thinke to put this upon us, that Proteſtants are for the bringing in Popery? He may as well hope to make us believe Tranſubſtantiation it ſelf, 'tis a Contradiction in Terms, an errant Bull. However, upon this occaſion, I cannot but reflect that I have ſometimes met with a ſort of ridiculous Animals, commonly call'd Proteſtants indeed, whoſe Heads are giddy, and whoſe Brains turn round with the Notion of a Catholicke Church, and a viſible ſucceſſion of Biſhops ever ſince the Apoſtles, Who run ſtark mad in love with reverend Words, holy Places, conſecrated Habits, and godly Geſtures, who have abundance of odde, ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Zeale, with not one grain of true ſence, Diſciples of <hi>Heylin,</hi> and <hi>Thornedike,</hi> in a word, a kinde of <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> Proteſtants, men who have liſted themſelves in our Service, and rank'd on our ſide only to betray our cauſe, and give our Enemies the Victory. They ſeem to have no other deſigne in the Church of <hi>England</hi> than <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> had in the <hi>Philistines</hi> Temple, <hi>viz.</hi> to pull it downe upon our Heads, and bury us in the Ruines<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Now what diſcourſe theſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:66369:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſort of men have had with the Compendianiſt, I cannot tell, nor am much concern'd, I will not diſpute, but that 'tis poſſible, they may have acknowledg'd ſome ſuch thing as he affirms, for their Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks are much of a pitch with their Divinity, and I know they will ſay, or confeſs any thing, that tends to undermine, and weaken the Proteſtant Faith, and Intereſt, though it be never ſo fooliſh, and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd. Yet do they take it hainouſly ill to be thought Papiſts, and particularly Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> ſeems more than ordinarily diſturb'd, when he finds himſelfe charg'd with this Imputation; how does he fling, and flounce in his late Pamphlets, like a gaull'd Hackney, who can neither bear the whipp, nor mend his dull Dog-Trot. But let him beſtow the foamings of his Rage never ſo faſt among the Rabble, and in haſty, uncorrect Libells throw about the e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I think nothing is plainer than that the great Endeavour of the Papiſts, ever ſince the Diſcovery of the Plot, has been by all kinde of means, and artifices, to turn off the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick <hi>Odium</hi> (under which they have ſo juſtly ſuffer'd) as much as was poſſible, from Themſelves upon the Fanaticks, and to ſtir up an ignorant, outragious clamour againſt them; the <hi>Presbyterian</hi> Plot ſound in the <hi>Meal Tub,</hi> and all the late Pamplets, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of the popiſh Agents, are, but ſo many continued, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Proofs of this. Now were <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> their Penſioner (as 'tis not improbable but he is) and as much ingag'd in their Service as <hi>Nevil-Payne;</hi> he could not have more effectually aſſiſted them in the carrying on of this baſe and Villanous Project than he has along done. How earneſtly has he labor'd to revive the Memory of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in contemptof the <hi>Act of Oblivion,</hi> and terrifi'd the people with groundleſſe Apprehenſions of a new Fanatick Warr? How con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly has he patch'd up his looſe Diſcouſes with unſeaſonable thread-bare Comments on the Diſorders of the late times, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd his malicious enmity to the Liberties of <hi>England</hi> with violent Invectives againſt <hi>Fanaticks?</hi> Their Defamation has been the chief aime of all his Writings ſince the Plot, the Burden of his overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Impertinence, and the Common place Topick of his Railing. Now let us ſuppoſe the Fanaticks as errant Devils as this Inquiſition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man has a mind to paint them, yet what have they done of late, what new provocation have they given ſince his Majeſties Reſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>artion, nay ſince the PLOT, (I meane the Fanaticks of <hi>England,)</hi> that we ſhould thus fall upon them Pell Mell, without either Fear or wit, Rhime or Reaſon. I ſay, what is the matter, That juſt after the Diſcovery, and in the midſt of the Examination of a Horrid Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh PLOT, we ſhould all of a ſuddain be hounded on Fanatickes? There is ſure ſome Myſtery in this. Alas! The Artifice is evident and groſſe. Who ſees not that the Deſigne of it is, to ſave the Papiſts from the growing Rage of the Peoples Hate, with which their whole Faction was almoſt run downe, and brought to a Bay, by ſtarting, and inviting their Proſecutors to freſh Grame? This, it ſeems, is the Under-PLOT to their great Tragedy, and Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange,</hi> next to ſome Provincial Jeſuite, the chief Manager.</p>
            <p>Can there be any Doubt then, however he appear a Proteſtant, in ſhew and Profeſſion, but that he is a PAPIST, either in Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple or Intereſt, if not in both: and theſe Intereſt-Papiſts are the moſt dangerous ol all. For his Panegyrick of the Religion eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd, and his high Expreſſions of Zeale for it, with which at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry turne, he flouriſhes his Miſchievous Pamphlets, and guilds the poyſon he would have the People Swallow, they are like the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement of <hi>Judas</hi> when he betray'd his Maſter, and like the Courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie of <hi>Joab</hi> when he murder'd <hi>Abner.</hi> But, God be thank'd, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants now know him too well, to believe in his Flatery, or be wheadled to their Ruine by his ſoft Words. His Writings have diſc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over'd ſoe palpable an ill-Will to the true Intereſt of the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Cauſe, and the Conſtitution of the Government (for they are at preſent both wound up in the ſame Bottom) and he has purſu'd his Malice with ſo reſtleſſe a diligence, and ſo furious a Zeal, that he's grown a <hi>Common Nuſance</hi> to all good Engliſhmen, and ripe for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

ſhall cruſh his little Plauſibilities with a Maſterly Reaſon, and ſhame him into ſilence by the Juſtneſſe of his Satyre. I ſhall leave him then to the Fate of <hi>Bayes,</hi> which he cannot long eſcape, and to the ſevere Reprimands of his own Conſcience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that full confutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all his Works, and that only one too which he wants confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to reply to, and begging the Reader's pardon for this long (but perhaps uſeful) Digreſſion, returne to the Compendianiſt. And, as to what concernes the preſent Argument between him and me, I queſtion not, but upon an impartial weighing of what is here offer'd, it will appear to every reaſonable man, That nothing is more perfectly oppoſite to our Civil, as well as Religious Intereſts than Popery, that nothing could be more prejudicial to the Mona rchy, nor more fatal to the proſperity of <hi>England,</hi> than if, after having with ſoe juſt abhorrence ſpew'd up that filthy Load of Superſtition, and Idolatry, with which ſhe was ſo long oppreſs'd, ſhe ſhould be forc'd, either by conqueſt from abroad, or by a Popiſh Succeſſion at home, to returne once more like the <hi>Dog to his Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,</hi> or like <hi>the Sow when ſhe has been waſh'd to her wallowing in the Mire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For his Objections of the Proteſtant Rebellion in <hi>Hungary,</hi> the late Riſing in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Murder of the Archbiſhop of Saint <hi>Andrews,</hi> and that <hi>Home-Blow</hi> of his, the <hi>Gazette Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of The Tryalk of twenty nine Proteſtant Regicides, they are of the ſame nature, and grounded on the ſame pitiful Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacy with thoſe I have already anſwer'd; and when he can ſhew us any Principle of the <hi>Prostant Religion</hi> that juſtifies <hi>Rebellion</hi> or <hi>Murder,</hi> eſpecially that of Princes, or does but in the remoteſt degree encourage men to commit thoſe Deteſtable Crimes, I ſhall again conſider them: In the mean time, let him not waſte his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and tire his Reader with the Repetition of ſuch fulſome So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry.</p>
            <p>But perhaps it may not be amiſſe to give a more particular Anſwer to his <hi>Home-blow,</hi> becauſe he has ſuch an opinion of its force, and does ſo triumph with the conceit of his Victory: I ſhall endeavour therefore to take him down in the height of his Rapture, and ſhame his ignorant Malice. The <hi>Reader</hi> will remember the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:66369:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Point he ſhould prove, is, <hi>That Proteſtant Principles are destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive to Kings;</hi> for thoſe are the very words of the Introduction to his terrible Argument of <hi>Inſtances of Fact.</hi> Now did the <hi>Twenty nine Proteſtant Regicides</hi> ever pretend to juſtifie their abominable Villany by any Principle of their Religion? Nay, did they not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the quite contrary, and ground it wholly upon a Civil Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity? Did they not argue the lawfulneſſe and juſtice of it from a Power they fancied in the People, to call the King to an Account for his Actions? Though in this they were as abſurd Logicians as the <hi>Compendianiſt</hi> has all along ſhew'd himſelf, and reaſon'd not only againſt the very firſt Principle of Civil Policy; but point blank con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the moſt fundamental <hi>Maxims</hi> of the Law of <hi>England,</hi> which ſays, <hi>That the King can do no wrong;</hi> and therefore makes his Miniſters queſtionable for the miſcarriages in Government, becauſe he himſelf is in his own Perſon, inviolable and ſacred: but this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns not the preſent buſineſſe. Theſe men, I ſay, (as bad as they were) had not the impudence to intereſt the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> or any <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> whatever, in the guilt of their impious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, by pretending to derive any Warrant or Encouragement for it from them; or if they had, it would have ſignified nothing to the <hi>Compendianiſt</hi>'s purpoſe, ſince there is no <hi>King-Depoſing,</hi> or <hi>King-Killing</hi> Principle to be found in any Proteſtant <hi>Confeſſions of Faith,</hi> or <hi>Articles of Communion,</hi> (which are the only proper Evidences to convince a <hi>Proteſtant Church</hi> of any Principle or Doctrine that is laid to her Charge) and ſo it would have amounted to no more than their particular miſtaking or perverting the Principles of their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as groſly and as wilfully as they did the Laws of their Country. But this is not the Caſe; for they did not ſo much as pretend any Warrant from the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> for what they did:</p>
            <p>How then can He charge <hi>Proteſtant Principles</hi> with the <hi>Perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Crimes</hi> of theſe men? Or what does his <hi>Home-Blow,</hi> and all his other Inſtances prove, except this only, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſeveral <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> have been <hi>Rogues, very great Rogues, Murderers, Rebels, Traytors,</hi> &amp;c. Does He not know that they are all mortal men too, and ſubject to many other Vices, which he might very clearly have prov'd upon them (if he he had pleas'd) by undeniable Examples? There's not a Sin the <hi>Pope</hi> pardons, of what Price ſoever, but 'tis
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:66369:13"/>
too ſadly true, that <hi>Proteſtants</hi> have been guilty of it at ſome time or other, if that will do him any ſervice. But now in the name of a little common ſenſe, Who, or what does this <hi>Raver</hi> oppoſe in this ſtrenuous Argument? Did ever any of our Writers aſſert that all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the World were good Men, and pious Chriſtians? Or is there any ſort of people among us beſides Quakers, <hi>i. e.</hi> mad men, who hold a ſtate of Abſolute Perfection in this Life? He has put himſelf into an extraordinary Heat, and made ſtrange violent Aſſaults, and yet no Enemy appears near him. What ayles the man? he has ſure been combating ſome Giant in imagination, like <hi>Don Quixote</hi> when he hack'd down the Walls of his Chamber. Well, whoever he be, though it were <hi>Malambruno</hi> himſelf, I'l war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant him he's kill'd outright, this <hi>La Mancha</hi> has ſo laid about him with <hi>Home-Blows.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another great quarrel he has to the Biſhop is, that he does not anſwer four Books (nam'd in the <hi>Compendium</hi>'s margin) writ (it ſeems) <hi>by the Catholicks of</hi> England <hi>ſince the Kings Reſtoration,</hi> about <hi>the Depoſing Power of the Church;</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Compend. pag. 78.</note> 
               <hi>His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> (ſays he) <hi>is ſo far from anſwering theſe Authors, that he never ſo much as cites them to this purpoſe,</hi> (a great fault indeed) <hi>ſo that we muſt conclude them unanſwerable.</hi> Well argued o' my word; I ſee he deals in nothing but <hi>Home-Blows.</hi> Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi> and this <hi>Compendianist</hi> would have made a couple of rare Diſputants, if they had not been ſpoil'd by their Tutors, and ill-grounded at firſt; they have both an admirable na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural talent at <hi>Reaſoning,</hi> all the difference between them is, <hi>Bayes</hi> loved it in Rhime, and this man's altogether for it in Proſe. But without Raillery, does he believe the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln</hi> oblig'd to take particular notice of every idle Pamphlet of theirs, that keeps a Pudder about <hi>the Depoſing Power of the Church,</hi> (with deſign to make the buſineſs intricate and dark) and to think them as conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, as his Party always do their own Books? No doubt he takes it monſtrous ill too, that the Biſhop has not thought him worth his Anſwering, and perhaps concludes himſelf unanſwerable. But I hope I ſhall hinder him from falling into that miſtake, and make him ſenſible what an <hi>Impar Congreſſus Achilli,</hi> what a poor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible thing he is, when he appears in the Liſts againſt ſo great
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:66369:14"/>
a Scholar as the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln.</hi> For the Pamphlets he mentions, they are more than anſwered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the Biſhops Book, though it does not particularly name them; and when he, or any other <hi>Factor for Popery,</hi> gives a tolerable Anſwer to thoſe clear Teſtimonies I told him of before, <hi>(and which he never ſo much as cites to this purpoſe)</hi> by which the Biſhop does ſo plainly prove the Doctrine of <hi>Depoſing Kings</hi> upon the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> I here engage my word to him, theſe Pamphlets ſhall be made ridiculous by name, and their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſhew'd to the people in the Fools Coat they deſerve.</p>
            <p>In the next place he tells us, <note n="*" place="margin">Compend. pag. <hi>78.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>That the Venetians have openly in their very Writings denied this Depoſing Power of the Church without Cenſure:</hi> And, <hi>That ſeveral Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors have been cenſur'd in</hi> France <hi>and elſewhere for writing for it.</hi> In anſwer to which, Firſt, we know very well, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> does always accommodate her Allowing and Condemning of Books to the Circumſtances of her preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and as Princes are ſometimes forc'd by the neceſſity of their Affairs to diſavow the Actions of their Miniſters, though done by their moſt expreſſe Command; ſo is this intereſted Church fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently reduc'd to connive at Books which ſhe does by no means like, and to Cenſure others which ſhe does not only approve, but (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-hand) directs. A good inſtance of this we have in the caſe of <hi>Sanctarellus</hi>'s Book (one of thoſe he mentions) which though at firſt Printed by the Approbation and ſpecial Licenſe of <note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Sanctarel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> himſelf.</note> 
               <hi>Mutius Vittelleſcus,</hi> then General of the Jeſuits, and by the Order of the Maſter of the Popes Palace; yet when the Pope found it would not be endur'd in <hi>France,</hi> but that both the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> had condemn'd it, and the Parliament of <hi>Paris</hi> had order'd it to be burnt, he thought fit (after it had been out ſo long, that the Copies were almoſt all bought up) to forbid the Sale of it at <hi>Rome,</hi> but without any manner of Cenſure, either upon the Author or Doctrine, <note n="*" place="margin">See more of this in the Preface to the Jeſuits Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty.</note> which is generally their way of condemning theſe kind of Books, when Civil Conſiderations at laſt oblige them to it, <hi>viz.</hi> a bare prohibition of them, after every body has read them that cares for them.

For, Secondly, we know well enough that thoſe Principles of <hi>Depoſing and Killing Kings, and Extirpating Hereticks,</hi> are thought too precious Truths, and too high Points to be ordinarily expos'd to the Vulgar, and preſs'd upon all Occaſions; that they are the <hi>Arcana Imperii</hi> of their Kingdom of Darkneſſe, and kept like Warrants Dormant among the <hi>Cabala</hi> of their wicked Myſteries, to juſtifie Rebellions, Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinates, and Maſſacres, when the Church has very great need of them, and finds it her Intereſt to own theſe <hi>Doctrines of Devils;</hi> at other times it may ſuit better with her Deſigns to preach up Loyalty and Obedience to Princes, and univerſal Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to Mankind. Laſtly, we know that the <hi>Venetians</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> have been always Oppoſers of the Pope's Encroachments upon civil Sovereigns, and that they do not ſubmit to theſe ſort of Doctrines, which are ſo directly calculated for his attaining an Abſolute Dominion over the Chriſtian World, a long proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted <hi>Fifth Monarchy,</hi> at leaſt in the ſame degree, that other Countries which are more Jeſuited and enſlav'd to the Pope, are forc'd to do; which by the way may ſerve for a good Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to convince them of Differences among themſelves, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verthrow their glorious pretence of Union, which they do ſo magnifie upon all occaſions to our reproach, but cannot ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie any thing to the purpoſe, for which the <hi>Compendianist</hi> here intends it, <hi>viz.</hi> to ſhew the Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> in Anſwer to his Challenge at the end of his Book, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>has by publick Acts and Declarations diſown'd and condemn'd thoſe Principles which His Lordſhip charges upon her.</hi> He very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently indeed affirms, that the Cenſures of thoſe Authors he mentions <hi>p:</hi> 78. <hi>l.</hi> 32. are ſuch.

What ſcorn then can be vile enough to throw upon his impudent Claim of the Biſhop's conditional promiſe of turning <hi>Papist,</hi> when the termes upon which that promiſe was given are ſo far from being made good? And why does he run over ſuch a Bead-role of names—<hi>The Colledge of the Sorbonne, Paris, Caen, Rheimes,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay to what end does he ſtun us with this vaſt Din of inſignificant Words, and rattle in our ears with empty Sounds?</p>
            <p>I thought to have paſs'd by his Quibble upon the Biſhop's Title, 'tis ſo very ſenceleſſe and thin a conceit; but becauſe I find he is apt to think every thing unanſwerable that is not particularly taken notice of, I ſhall do him the favour to make the Reader obſerve this ridiculous Criticiſm: <hi>Who could think</hi> (ſays <note n="*" place="margin">Compend. pag. 76.</note> he) <hi>that His Lordſhips Heat againſt us ſhould force him even to a Title that has confuted his whole Book,</hi> viz. <hi>That Popiſh Principles and Poſitions (when really believ'd) are deſtructive and dangerous to all Kings, especially Proteſtants; for he cannot term them Principles of Faith, becauſe they were never thus Believ'd, &amp;c.</hi> I ſuppoſe by <hi>Principles of Faith</hi> here, he means what is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly underſtood by <hi>Articles of Faith, i. e.</hi> Points neceſſary to Salvation; for the words are equivocal, and may bear ſeveral ſences: but becauſe this is moſt favourable to his Objection, I ſhall underſtand them ſo. Now why cannot the Biſhop term theſe Poſitions <hi>Principles of Faith?</hi> He has prov'd them to have been decreed both by Popes and Councils; and if that be not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to make any Point a <hi>Principle of Faith</hi> in their Church
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:66369:15"/>
I know not where or how we ſhall find any <hi>Principles of Faith</hi> among them. He ſays indeed here (and in other places would inſinuate the ſame) <hi>That they were never thus believ'd by any Catholick, nor never thus approv'd of by the Church.</hi> But that's only his word againſt the Biſhop's Proof, and ſignifies nothing but to convince the World of the ſhameleſs Impudence of Popiſh Writers, who can even in Print, and in the face of a learned and inquiring People, affirm things contrary to direct Proofs, without ever ſo much as endeavouring to anſwer thoſe Proofs. I ſee no reaſon therefore why the Biſhop might not have term'd them <hi>Principles of Faith,</hi> if he had pleas'd, but that it was not at all material to the deſign of his Diſcourſe ſo to do; 'twas enough for his purpoſe to prove them <hi>Principles of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> (which he has moſt clearly done) no matter whether they hold them neceſſary to Salvation or not; their very holding them as <hi>Principles of their Religion,</hi> does make that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently dangerous to Princes, which was what the Biſhop un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to ſhow. But let us ſuppoſe now, that the Biſhop cannot term theſe Poſitions <hi>Principles of Faith,</hi> I'le engage it ſhall do his Title no more hurt, than 'tis plain it would his Book; indeed neither of them any at all. <hi>This Title</hi> (ſays he) <hi>That Popiſh Principles and Poſitions (when really believ'd) are deſtructive, &amp;c. has confuted his whole Book.</hi> Why? Becauſe he cannot term them (pray mark the Reaſon) <hi>Principles of Faith,</hi> &amp;c. Can any unprejudic'd man now, whoſe Brains lie in their right place, perceive any ſort of Conſequence in this Argument? for my own part I can find none. But if there be any little ſence at the bottom of this awkard blunder, it muſt be this, <hi>viz.</hi> a ſuppoſal, that the real Belief of any <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of Religion</hi> makes it immediately a <hi>Principle of Faith, (i. e.</hi> in his ſence of thoſe Terms, a point neceſſary to Salvation) though it was not ſo before: which is certainly the moſt extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant Whimſey that ever got hold of any mans Imagination, but our confus'd <hi>Compendianiſts;</hi> and if this be not his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he talks <hi>Wild Iriſh,</hi> and is utterly unintelligible. I think I need not go about to confute ſuch ſelf-evident Foolery as this; the very Offer were an affront to the meaneſt Readers Underſtanding; there's hardly a School-boy, but knows that
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:66369:16"/>
Chriſtian Religion teaches many uſeful and true Doctrines, which are not neceſſary to Salvation, that yet are really believ'd by all thoſe that are really of the Chriſtian Religion. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's Title therefore is very proper, and very conſiſtent with the deſign of his Book, and this man's exception to it moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furd and frivolous. 'Tis indeed not only proper, but charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and modeſt; it implies the Biſhop does not believe, that all who live in the external Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are either ſo diſloyal to their Prince, or ſo unmerciful to their Friends and Neighbours, as thoſe Doctrines he charges upon her, really and heartily aſſented to, muſt needs make them. He hopes poſſibly, that Humane Nature it ſelf in ſome may check at their harſhoeſſe and a particular ſweetneſſe of temper in others, very much allay the Malignancy of their Poyſon, and hinder them from having their full effect upon the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, at leaſt ſuch an effect as is juſtly to be dreaded from them, when they ſeize upon the minds of Melancholy Recluſes, or ſink deep into the affections of her ignorant hot headed Devoto's, thoſe Chriſtian <note n="*" place="margin">A Sect of Religious Murderers among the <hi>Turks.</hi> See an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of them in <hi>Tavernier's</hi> Six Voyages, <hi>pag. 199.</hi>

            <p>For the Promiſe he makes us at laſt, in imitation of the Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop's, <note n="†" place="margin">Compend. pag. 79.</note> That he himſelf will turn Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, <hi>if the Biſhop ſhews him but one ſingle Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph in all his Book, in relation to their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Principles that he has not fully anſwer'd,</hi> &amp;c. I will be ſo civil to him at parting, to let him know he need not be in any pain about it; for though the Condition of his Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation be not in the leaſt meaſure, nor is ever likely to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, yet I can aſſure him there's no body intends to take any advantage of the Forfeiture. Though he has been ſo far from anſwering every ſingle Paragraph of the Biſhop's Book, that he has not in truth anſwer'd one ſingle word of it to any purpoſe, as I have already ſhow'd him; yet we will not be ſo unmerciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rigorous to require a Perſon of his Form of Parts to turn Proteſtant, and force him to be a reaſonable man, and a good Chriſtian againſt his Conſcience; no, no, let him ſtay

            <p>His little Stroke of Common Place Arguments being now ſpent, he is at laſt reduc'd to Story telling, and the concluſion of his looſe Ramble in this Paragraph againſt the Biſhop is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible ſcandalous Tale about a Friend of his, and Doctor <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> by which he repreſents that late famous and worthy Divine, not only as a Papiſt but a Knave, and implicitely throws the ſame dirt upon the Biſhop; maliciouſly inſinuating as if neither of them believ'd their own Books.

But this is one of the ſmall Games their ill ſucceſſe has forc'd them to play at, rather than ſtick out, a deſpicable ſhift to keep up ſome little reſt of Credit to their baffled Cauſe; and would they obſerve any ſort of Bounds in the Spoyl and Havock they make of mens good Names, and their Invaſions of the beſt and moſt laſting Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of Mankind in their Unchriſtian Violations of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Dead; Would theſe lawleſſe Church Corſairs, theſe deſperate Picaroons for Popery, robbe with modeſty, and be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy'd with making private men their Prize, we ſhould perhaps content our ſelves to deſpiſe their little Pyracies, and laugh at their feeble Inroades. But when they endeavour to ſink our ſtrongeſt Men of War, and take our very Admirals in the Port; when they will needs have our chief Leaders to be their Followers, and our moſt famous Champions at the Wheels of their Triumphal Chariots, when like the <hi>Tartar's Scotch</hi> Captive, they will pretend to hold their Goalers Priſoners, and erect their ridiculous Trophies upon the Tombes of their Conquerours. When nothing will ſerve their turns but that <hi>Chillingworth</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf muſt be believ'd to dye a Papiſt, and Biſhop <hi>King</hi> to be reconcil'd to their Church in <hi>Articulo mortis;</hi> when Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> muſt now after his Death be thought a Friend to Popery, who in his life was both an Honour and a Defence to the Proteſtant Faith, their impudence is intollerable, and their Lyes grow miſchievous; 'tis then neceſſary to expoſe the folly of their vain Pretences, and warne the people of their large Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now appeale to the Judgement of any unprejudic'd man, who has read Dr. <hi>Taylors Diſſuaſive from Popery,</hi> and if
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:66369:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
he thinks there is the leaſt probability that the Author of that excellent Book ſhould ſay he could write one twice as good againſt Proteſtants, or indeed any poſſibility that either He, or any man elſe, though never ſo willing, ſhould be able to do it. I will hereafter believe that Jeſuites can ſpeak Truth, and that Popiſh Controvertiſts may be ſometimes in the right, Dr. <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors</hi> Relations, and thoſe who did particularly know him (which I had not the happineſs to do, otherwiſe than by his Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and his Writings) are able; without doubt, to ſay much more upon this Subject than. I can pretend to, and I queſtion not but ſome of them will take care in convenient time to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate his Memory from ſoe foule a ſcandall as that of being a conceal'd Papiſt, and of Writing what he did not think. I ſhall therefore leave it to them, whoſe proper concern it is, not having at preſent the means to make any enquiry my ſelfe into the buſineſſe. In the mean time let us ſuppoſe this Story to be true, which, according to all appearance is next to impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, what is here pretended to have been ſaid by Dr. <hi>Taylor,</hi> was I perceive, a thing ſaid in private converſation, and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in great truſt and confidence of the perſon to whom 'twas ſpoke; how to Print this to the World, with Deſign to blaſt the Reputation of a Divine, after his Death, is ſuch a piece of hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty and good nature, as is no where to be met with, but in the Moralls of a Jeſuite, and the Chriſtianity of a <hi>Romiſh</hi> Zealot.</p>
            <p>For what is intended in this malicious Paſſage to reflect on the Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne,</hi> as if he were as bad a Hypocrite, as Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi> is here repreſented to have been, and could have writ (if he had pleas'd) a better Book on the Papiſts ſide, 'tis ſo witleſs a Libel, ſuch ſilly Slander, that I think there is no need of anſwering it to any, who have ever heard of his great Name, and he muſt have liv'd very remote from Company, who is in <hi>England</hi> a Stranger to that. His Life is a ſufficient proof of the honeſty of his Writings, and a full confutation of this, and all other Lyes, which the Inſtruments of <hi>Rome</hi> or Hell can invent to aſperſe him; in vain do they think to anſwer him, as they have done other men, by reflections on his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:66369:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and to overthrow his Reaſons by ridiculous Stories, and abſurd <hi>Romance:</hi> theſe <hi>Argumenta ad Hominem,</hi> which are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally their beſt Refuge, will miſerably fail them here? they look like the frettings of a gaul'd Faction, and do but betray an impotent Spite; the Biſhop of <hi>Lincolne</hi>'s Honour is as much above the reach of their malice, as their deſerts, and they may then hope to make the World think ill of him when they can ſo far cozen it as to be thought well off themſelves. 'Tis true his Abilities are extraordinary enough to recommend almoſt any thing he would appear for, though never ſo unreaſonable, and no doubt, he knows how to write Sophiſtries as well as to confute them; but we are ſatisfyed his Piety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> will no more ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer him to plead a bad Cauſe than his Learning will let him prejudice a good one. Beſides, let them not flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the Knavery of theirs is now ſo palpably obvious, their Religion has, by long and conſtant delays, grown ſo monſtrou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly deform'd, it has at laſt out-liv'd the help of Art. The Writings of their beſt Witts, and their moſt eminent Scholars have, in my Opinion, done it more hurt than good; when they have adorn'd it all they can with ſtrain'd pieces of Rhetorick out of the Fathers, and daub'd it as much as poſſible with the forc'd Flatteries of Councils; when they have ſet it forth in the ſpecious colours of pretended Union and Univerſality, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd it all over with School-Diſtinction<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, what can an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent man conclude but that ſuch vaſt paines would not, nor need not be taken, except it were to hide ſome notorious De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects; ſuch extream ſtudyed Ornaments are evident proofes of great want of natural Beauty: in a word, this Spiritual Whore does but appeare the more Strumpet through the groſſe Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of her Dreſs, and the thickneſs of her Paint.</p>
            <p>I have now done with the Compendianiſt, and ſhall enlarge this Diſcourſe no farther but to joyn with all good <hi>Engliſh men</hi> in offering up my hearty prayers to God Almighty, that He would ſtill preſerve the Proteſtant Religion among us, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to render fruitleſſe the contrary Endeavours and Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances of <hi>wicked and unreaſonable Men;</hi> fallacious Writers, and Traiterous Plotters; that He would keep the moſt knowing, and

beſt civiliz'd Nation in the World from falling again under the <hi>Barbariſm of Popery,</hi> from being Oppreſt by the Tyranny, and cumber'd with the Weight of this huge unweildy Maſs of Non-ſenſe, and Puppetry.
