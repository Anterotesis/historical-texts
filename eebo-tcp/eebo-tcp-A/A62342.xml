            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="7">7. <hi>It is the Greateſt and Richeſt Trade in the Univerſe; is Coveted by all</hi> Europaean <hi>Nations; Its Proſecution having been Eminently ſignificant to the Grandeur, Strength, and Wealth of many Countries, as its Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect and Loſs hath been to their Poverty and Contempt.</hi>

                  <div type="section">
                     <head>I. In Reference to the Natives.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. IN thoſe vaſt and various Regions are many diſtinct Kings and Princes, who Act by the Dictates of their own Arbitrary Will, without any fixt Laws; are by Religion, Pagans, or <hi>Mahu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metans;</hi> and apt to Depraedate, Murder, and Deſtroy upon any ſmall Offence, or pretended Fault.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. All the Governments in <hi>India</hi> are Abſolutely <hi>Monarchical</hi> (if not <hi>Tyrannical</hi>) and value nothing but what cometh under that Notion in a ſingle Perſon, or entire Body.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. By the Standard-Laws of all thoſe Countries, all Strangers that flye for Protection into any of thoſe Regions, become Slaves to that Prince to whoſe Protection they flye. And in caſe of Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack, all Ships, Goods, and People are a Prey to that Prince in whoſe Territories they met with with that Misfortune.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The <hi>Indian</hi> Kings are unable to Protect us againſt any Invaſion by their Enemies, and yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect we ſhould ſupply them with Ships, Sloops, Ammunition, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Monſons (or Trade-Winds) being only two (againſt which it is dangerous, if not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to Navigate) If our Ships ſhould by diſtreſs of Weather, be forced into any ſtrange Port, they will run an inevitable hazard by the Treachery and Subtilty of the Natives.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. Thoſe Kings being Arbitrary in their Powers, exact Cuſtoms at pleaſure, either Inward or Outward: To diſpute which, is dangerous; To allow, heavy. And nothing is to be done in thoſe Parts without Preſents.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Upon any Injury received, they take Satisfaction from the next Ship, or People of that Nation, which they meet with.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. Thoſe Kings frequently raiſe and fall the Prizes of Pepper, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at their pleaſure; will not be denyed to be Truſted, often force our Goods, and ſeldom perform Contracts.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. The King of <hi>Bantam</hi> is a great Merchant, hath ſeveral Ships of our Building, many Seamen of our Nation (ſome Fugitives to him, others forced from us) and often Commands out of our Factories all ſorts of Goods, Ammunition, Ships-tackle, and Proviſions.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. The King of <hi>Bantam</hi> being a great Merchant, ſupplies his own Neighbour-Ports with all Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Commodities from <hi>India;</hi> private Ships can only buy Pepper with Ryals 8/8; the Companies Goods being moſt Sold on Truſt, payable at the <hi>Monſons</hi> in Pepper.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. That if any Affronts be given to Private Ships, by Exactions, Seizures, or Aſſaſſinates, they are unable to Revenge, but muſt fall a Sacrifice; and if unrevenged, leave a Precedent of Ruine to the next commer.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. That all Ports in thoſe Regions are dangerous for Theft, Poyſon, and <hi>Amócks;</hi> ſo that there is ſmall Security there on Shoar, by Day, without Arms; and at Night, without Guards.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. That if any Civil Wars, Inſurrections, or other Inteſtine Troubles happen among the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives there, they will prove Fatal to any Private Concernments, who are unable to Defend themſelves in Port, or on Shoar; nor can depart at their Pleaſure from the Shoar, nor well out of the Land, but at the Seaſon of the <hi>Monſon.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="14">14. In thoſe Climates (whether by Natural Inclinations, Irregularity of Manners, Remiſsneſs in Temperance, or frequent Temptations) our <hi>Europaeans</hi> are too apt for looſe and Debauched Practiſes; which, though Committed by ſingle Perſons, yet often prove Fatal to the Concernment of that whole Nation.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>II. <hi>In Reference to the</hi> Dutch.</head>
                     <p n="1">1. The <hi>Dutch</hi> being an United Body, and Acting in an United Stock, Rich, Potent, Subtle, and Envious of our Commerce, will not neglect to Inſtigate the Kings in <hi>India</hi> (Clandeſtinely) in time of Peace; and (openly) in time of War, to ſeize our Perſons, Ships, and Eſtates; expel us their Countrey, or ſurrender us to the <hi>Dutch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="2">2. If a War with the <hi>Dutch</hi> in <hi>India,</hi> no Private Traders dare to Adventure; if they do, they muſt be loſt.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Our former Grounds of Jealouſie for the Inhumanity uſed by the <hi>Dutch</hi> to our private Ships, may juſtly make us fear the like again; the meaneſt of their Souldiers and Seamen being under an Oath of Secreſie.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The <hi>Dutch</hi> will be glad to ſee our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt laid open; whilſt they (for ſome Years) would under-ſell, and over-buy us, till we were diſcouraged, and forced to decline the Trade; and then Oblige the Natives by general Contracts to Trade only with them.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The <hi>Dutch</hi> alſo on any pretences ſeek to poſſeſs themſelves of all places fit for Trade; and in their Wars with the <hi>Indians,</hi> block up their Ports, and permit no Freedom of Trade with any; others they bind up by Articles: And yet have Peace with us in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="6">6. The <hi>Dutch</hi> on all Occaſions are very intent to foment any Diviſions among the Natives, that they may be invited to the Aſſiſtance of either Party; and then they ſoon give Laws to, or become Maſters of both.</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="section">
                     <head>III. <hi>In Reference to the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Intereſt.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p n="1">1. Every Man will value his own Intereſt above the Publick, will ſtrive for the firſt Port, and firſt Market; under-ſell, and over-buy; without any care for the future.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. They will be ſubject to great Fractions and Diſcontents; when all their Appeals muſt be to the Kings, who know how (ſubtilly) to blow the Coals of ſuch Animoſities, for their own Concerns, to our Prejudice, if not Ruine.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. Every Man will be nibling, whilſt a Proſpect of Profit, and ſo over-glut the Trade with Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities for two or three Years, that the Prizes would grow Contemptible. But, no Profit in a ſhort time thereby ariſing, the Trade for the future would ſoon be neglected; and all the Forts, Factories, Priviledges, and <hi>Engliſh</hi> Intereſt loſt.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. It will cauſe a greater Export of <hi>Bullion</hi> and <hi>Coin,</hi> than in a Company; nor can it be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. A Ship Laden with <hi>Europe</hi> Commodities only ſhall not find Vend at any one Port, from the <hi>Cape</hi> of <hi>Good Hope</hi> to <hi>Surrat;</hi> nor from <hi>Surrat</hi> to the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Bengala;</hi> nor from the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>Bengala</hi> to <hi>China,</hi> or all over the <hi>South Seas;</hi> but muſt hunt for a Trade from Port to Port, which hazard and tediouſneſs will Neceſſitate all or moſt part of her Cargo to be inveſted in Ryals 8/8 and Gold.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. If the Return-Trade be made by the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> or any other Parts than <hi>England;</hi> (which for Advantage ſome will adventure to do) it will prove very pernicious to our Nation, by the Detriment of our Cuſtoms, and perverting the Trade from the <hi>Mart</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. Ship-wracks, Mutinies, Combinations to Caſt away Ships (for <hi>Bodemery</hi> or <hi>Enſurance</hi>) or to run away with Ships, muſt be expected; wherein not only the Adventurers, but the Nation is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. The Trade not being fully Diſcovered, ſuch farther Diſcovery will moſt Advantagiouſly be made by a Company, from their ſettled Factories, than by any new and private Adventures from hence.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That the Empire of <hi>Turky</hi> is entire, under one Prince, who ſeldom commits any Notorious Outrage upon us, without ſome ſpecious Pretence, being under the Eye of many great <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates. <hi>India</hi> is Remote, under various Princes, Laws, Religions, Languages, and Diſpoſitions.

That Empire being under general Articles of Peace with our King, and the People more Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilized; one Ambaſſador at that Court, with a Conſul in each Province, may ſuffice for that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce: Their Laws being fixt, Trade free, and Cuſtoms (generally) certain.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the Kings of <hi>India</hi> are many (ſome Great, and ſome Small) the Great Kings will expect Reſidentiary Ambaſſadours (beſides Conſuls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) And the Small Princes, (at leaſt) Conſuls, or Chiefs; which would amount to an unimaginable Charge. Nor is it unlikely, but that under ſo many ſeveral Ambaſſadors and Conſuls (unleſs all be Subordinate to ſome one Superiour Power in <hi>India</hi>) many Fatal Diſcontents may ariſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In <hi>Perſia, Indoſtan,</hi> and <hi>Bengala</hi> (being more Civilized) ſuch a Model of Regulation may be Practicable, (perhaps) although it is to be feared, it would not be there long-liv'd: But as to <hi>China, Japan,</hi> and the <hi>South Seas,</hi> &amp;c. it is wholly Impracticable without Forts, Gariſons, Colonies, or Staple Factories in ſome convenient places.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That the Premiſes for Forts, Gariſons, Ships, and People being conſidered, eſpecially in time of War (when few, or no Ships can Arrive) it will be almoſt impoſſible to raiſe ſo great a Charge: Nor will any ſuch Society dare to engage to ſecure it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That the preſent Forts and Gariſons on the Iſland <hi>Bombaim,</hi> and <hi>Fort St. George,</hi> and all the other Reſidencies and Factories, will amount to a vaſt Sum, which will puzzle a Regulation to raiſe at the firſt Undertaking; and in good Conſcience they ought to be paid for, to a full and ſatisfactory value.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. Nor can ſuch a Regulation make a Company more National than the preſent Company in their United Stock. And ſhould our Nation Engage to aſſiſt them with a Fleet, it would be ineffectual, without ſome convenient Ports and Colonies, for their Security, and freſh Proviſions; which would alſo meet with many Difficulties, ſince two or three Ships could hardly Arrive together.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. Should this Kingdom aſſiſt them with a Fleet, a Regulation could hardly contrive any Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal to raiſe the Charge for its Expedition and Support.</p>

                  <p n="3">3. The different Intereſts would make a Schiſm in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Blood in <hi>India;</hi> and (perhaps) in <hi>England</hi> too; not only to our ſhame, but Prejudice.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The whole Trade of <hi>India</hi> (if poſſible) ſhould be only driven by one Hand, and not ſhared between ſo many <hi>Europaean</hi> Nations, which Opportunity of Graſping and Engroſſing the <hi>Dutch</hi> will not omit.</p>
