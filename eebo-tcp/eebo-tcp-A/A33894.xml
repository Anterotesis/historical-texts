         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

of <hi>Damnation</hi> to all that ſhould reſiſt them, calling them <hi>Rebels,</hi>

            <p>Another ſort of <hi>Clergy-men,</hi> who were then ſomething more
refined, and were indeed many of them more zealous and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encious,
they prayed againſt the proſperity of the <hi>KING,</hi> and
his <hi>Party,</hi> and againſt the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> with the reſt of their Train, and
ſo when one <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> another <hi>Curſed;</hi> and ſo men according to
their affections ſided, and both were upon <hi>pain of damnation,</hi> and
here the Leaders of the people cauſed them to erre, and many
thouſands that were thus led were deſtroyed; and with great
difficulty did the War go on for a long ſeaſon, and the victory
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:43939:3"/>
inclining to neither; But the <hi>Army</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>his party</hi>
grew numerous, and ſtill they who were called the <hi>Miniſters,</hi>
ceaſed not on either part to Preach up the intereſt they had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken,
though never ſo much blood might be ſhed in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
thereof, untill the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>that party</hi> was worſted and
overthrown: And then ſome began to ſee that it was not hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
but intereſt that made them ſo eager; So then they called
<hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Parliaments</hi> part, many of them ſeeing that their
gain was in danger by reaſon of that prevailing party which then
had overthrown the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>his Army,</hi> they (to wit the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
ſo called) began to drive on new deſignes, ſo that they
can never ceaſe fomentinng of diviſion, except their intereſt be at
top and they themſelves alwaies divided amongſt themſelves, by
reaſon of their great number, that ſome of them alwayes wants
room, ſo that they have leiſure and liberty, ability and opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
to deviſe <hi>new ſtratagems</hi> to carry on <hi>new deviſions,</hi> that they
may ſupplant one another to make roome.</p>
            <p>But then when the <hi>Army</hi> had gotten the upper hand, and that
the <hi>Generall</hi> begins to appeare as if he might be at the Stern, and
that he countenanced thoſe who at that time the Lord had open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their eyes, and they diſcovered the rottenneſs of them called
<hi>Miniſters,</hi> then they ſet themſelves as it were wholly againſt him
by all manner of means; Labouring by Plotting, Preaching, and
Printing againſt them, believing in their minds, that if he ſhould
once be at reſt, and in full power, he would certainly have pluckt
down their <hi>Tythes:</hi> So from time to time, the fear of looſing
their great <hi>income</hi> on the one ſide, and the <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi>
of the other ſide, they never in no time want matter wherewith
to blow the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

ſort of people that ſtand in their way, and ſo labouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
them out of their way by cruelty towards them, having time
and opportunity to fill peoples hearts and minds with evill, by
Preaching up the wickedneſs of their own hearts, laying it upon
others whom they'l not ſuffer to anſwer for themſelves, by that
meanes laying ſuch loads of bitter Perſecutions upon people, that
have forced many to be Enemyes to thoſe againſt whom they had
no thought of evill, for who is there but will ſtand for his life?
So in that time when the then <hi>Generall</hi> had ſubdued them all, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43939:4"/>
brought them into ſubjection, how ſoon did they <hi>Court him</hi> with
<hi>Flatteryes,</hi> endeavouring to promote him to the higheſt honour,
and ſo blinded his judgment, and he ſuffering them to breath a
while, and not executing judgment ſpeedily, their hearts had
another miſchief to deviſe, and ſo then preaching up <hi>his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
as <hi>Jure divino,</hi> and then both they that had joyned with the
<hi>King,</hi> and ſtirred up people to fight for the <hi>King,</hi> and for the
<hi>Service-Book,</hi> and the reſt of that ſtuffe, and them alſo who
had fought againſt the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Service-Book,</hi> they ſoon became
one, and they preach up <hi>Oliver</hi> to be <hi>Protector,</hi> and they all
make uſe of his <hi>Authority,</hi> they tooke the <hi>Engagement</hi> againſt
<hi>King</hi> or Houſe of <hi>Lords,</hi> and ſo then he was the only <hi>man,</hi> and
this was the only <hi>Government;</hi> But ſtill there was a few people,
who ſtill ſaw their deceit and Treacherous dealing with all ſorts,
and theſe could not ceaſe to make mention of it, their ſouls be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
grieved with their abominable deceit, and then they make it
their whole buſineſs in all places to ſtir up the <hi>Rulers</hi> and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
the <hi>Protector</hi> to cut off ſuch from the earth; and they labour
to create <hi>Parliaments</hi> to their mind, and all ſorts of <hi>Rulers</hi> to
their mind, never ceaſing by all meanes to cut off this people:
But <hi>Oliver</hi> the <hi>Protector</hi> being by the Righteous hand of God cut
off, becauſe he had not executed the thing for which the Lord
raiſed him up, but ſuffered the people of the Lord to be ſorely
afflicted, and the ſame <hi>oppreſſion</hi> to remaine upon the free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
of this Nation as before. His Son <hi>Richard</hi> he came in his
ſtead, how then did the men called <hi>Miniſters</hi> haſten with
their addreſſes from their ſeverall <hi>Townes</hi> and <hi>Corporations</hi> to
congratulate the young <hi>Protector,</hi> and to give unto him the

was the <hi>Orient Star</hi> that was riſen to give them light, and ſuch
like; and ſo having lifted up the young mans heart, they then
thought themſelves ſecure, and then they with him call a <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
according to their own hearts deſire, whom they thought
were fitted to do the work which they long had deſired, but when
they had as it were brought that work to <hi>maturity,</hi> that was to

which they cryed unto the Lord, and he heard them; and they
likewiſe began to lay more <hi>heavy Yoaks</hi> upon Gods people,

not right in the ſight of God, and had no mind
to execute his judgment upon theſe who ſtill
held the people of God in bondage, the Lord
gave them no reſt, but brought in their Enemyes upon them
as a flood, his long-ſuffering being at an end, and the meaſure of
their tranſgreſſion finiſhed, he hath now delivered them into
the hands of their Enemyes; that as the Lord ſent his Servants to

the ſufferings of his people, yet the Lord often warned all ſorts
of them of the evil day that is now come upon them, and they
would not hear, nor regard the cry of the <hi>Oppreſſed;</hi> but the men

and cryed out in the ears of <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> where ever they came,
againſt a poor deſpired people, that they were Enemies to the

againſt the Government (of the <hi>Protector</hi> I mean,) and ſtirred up
the <hi>Rulers</hi> and they got <hi>Souldiers,</hi> and they (called <hi>Miniſters</hi>)

of that Government, and theſe are the men that now (as it were

            </p>
            <p>O you that are now <hi>Rulers;</hi> Are theſe men to be truſted? Are
theſe men to be followed as leaders? Are theſe men to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

whilſt they are the men ſet up, and their wayes upheld after

them, and were guided by them in their Councell, and had
their bleſſing, and were taught by them, that they were in the
Truth, and that they ſhould proſper? And did they not prove

<hi>Protector,</hi> if he had done the thing he promiſed and engaged for,
and had broken the <hi>Yoak</hi> of the <hi>Oppreſſor,</hi> and removed the <hi>Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,</hi>

For now conſider, that it was never <hi>Names,</hi> as <hi>Kings,</hi> or
<hi>Judges,</hi> or <hi>Elders,</hi> or ſuch like that the Lord owned, not the
name of the thing one more then another, but the thing it ſelf,
that is to ſay, the <hi>Ruler</hi> called by what name he would; he that
ruled for God, neither the right as by ſucceſſion, or not ſo, if he
ruled for God, he eſtabliſhed him; as <hi>Saul</hi> whom the Lord choſe,
yet when he did not obey the voyce of God, the Lord <hi>rent the

and this cannot be done, as long as the men called <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters</hi>
are thus <hi>ſet over the people,</hi> and can <hi>exact</hi> by <hi>force</hi> ſo large

that can carry on <hi>Plots</hi> and <hi>deſignes</hi> to overturn <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
as they can, for they being ſcattered over all the <hi>Nation</hi>
in every <hi>Pariſh,</hi> having ſo large a <hi>maintenance,</hi> they have lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and know the mindes of every perſon in the Pariſh, how
they ſtand affected, and to whom, and they themſelves under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of <hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>Praying</hi> have opportunity to meet, and
by that know the minds of every one amongſt themſelves, how
they ſtand affected, and by this meanes they can <hi>Poyſon</hi> a whole
<hi>Nation,</hi> and leaven them <hi>with malice,</hi> againſt whom they pleaſe;
for <hi>as is the Prieſt</hi> ſo <hi>is the People,</hi> or the moſt of them, who are
their followers, and ſo then if their intereſt be upheld, they will
uphold them that uphold it, whatſoever they are, they will preach
peace unto them, and promiſe them proſperity, though the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the Lord be at the doore, and their intereſt are ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring
one unto another, that they one ſtand in the deſtruction of
the other, for the <hi>Old Proteſtant</hi> ſo called, he cannot ſtand with
the <hi>Papiſt,</hi> nor the <hi>Preſbyter</hi> with the <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> nor the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent</hi>
with <hi>either,</hi> and the pride of their hearts, and the gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs
of their gaine, that cauſeth them that they alwayes envy
one another, for becauſe of the greatneſs of their profit and pride
of life, and the eaſe of their fleſh, there is ſo many that ſeek after
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:43939:6"/>
it, and ſo this blinds the minds of them, (the God of us World)
and ſo they cry up <hi>that man</hi> and <hi>that Government</hi> that will ſtand
for them, and uphold their gaine though to the deſtruction of all
others beſides themſelves.</p>
            <p>So it is altogether <hi>inconſiſtant</hi> with the <hi>ſafety of the people,</hi> and
the well being of the <hi>Ruler</hi> or <hi>Rulers,</hi> the <hi>upholding</hi> and <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining</hi>
a <hi>Miniſtry</hi> by a <hi>forced maintenance,</hi> It oppreſſeth <hi>the poor,</hi>
burtheneth <hi>the Conſcience,</hi> ſtirreth <hi>up ſtrife and Contention,</hi> brings
Gods <hi>wrath upon people,</hi> and that is the reaſon that ſo many of the
<hi>worſt</hi> of <hi>People</hi> get to be <hi>Miniſters,</hi> becauſe whether they be
<hi>good</hi> or <hi>bad,</hi> if they love <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Wantonneſs,</hi> and <hi>Luſt,</hi> and <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
and <hi>Luxury,</hi> here if they can but uſe a meanes, either <hi>direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi>
or <hi>indirectly</hi> to get the place, they know their ſtrength, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they are, or whatſoever they do, they are ſure to be provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for, <hi>having a Law to inforce it;</hi> and ſo many people where
there is any fear of God (though they are ſuch as follow that kind
of <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> yet when they ſee ſuch a one looſe and prophane) they
grieve and murmour in their minds, and Gods Witneſſe in their
Conſcience teſtifies both againſt <hi>them</hi> and their <hi>Minister,</hi> and
troubles them, and ſo here is fear and doubt, and then they ſeek
abroad for ſatisfaction, then the <hi>Miniſters</hi> (ſo called) rages and
he ſtirrs up the reſt of the people againſt the man who is not ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
in his Conſcience under the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> of (it may be) ſuch an
<hi>Ignorant, Blind, Prophane, Covetous, Proud, Unruly, Wanton Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man</hi> (as a <hi>Miniſter</hi>) who they believe can never lead them, or
reach him the way to Heaven, who himſelf never went a ſtep
therein, but is in the broad way to eternall deſtruction, and ſo
<hi>if the blind lead the blind</hi> (he knows) <hi>both muſt fall together:</hi>
So then the man called <hi>Miniſter,</hi> he pre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ches to the reſt of his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
prophane Congregation, and he ſets their mindes on fire
of hell againſt him, and then he complaines of him to <hi>Authority,</hi>
and he hath enough to joyne with him to be evidence againſt him
the poor man, and then under the Notion of an <hi>Heretick,</hi> or <hi>a
dangerous perſon</hi> or <hi>principle</hi> to the Government, they proceed
againſt him, and rack and torture him; and then all them in whoſe
hearts there's any feeling or compaſſion or honeſty, they conclude
this man doth not deſerve this, and that both <hi>Ruler</hi> and <hi>Miniſter</hi>
hath not dealt well to puniſh after ſuch a manner ſuch an <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:43939:6"/>
man,</hi> and ſay in their hearts, if this be their Law, how ſhall
we live amongſt them? And here diviſion ariſeth and increaſeth, and
the bond of peace is broken; but if the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> be ſuch a one
as hath any zeal or tenderneſs towards God, and will not joyne
with the <hi>Miniſter</hi> (ſo calledt) o invent a way, and wreſt a Law to
puniſh the poor diſſatisfied man, but perceives the <hi>Miniſter</hi> to be
ſuch a one as rather deſerves puniſhment, Then the <hi>Miniſter</hi>
rages in his mind againſt him, and he ſecretly deviſeth miſchief
againſt him, and goes to others whoſe ears he thinks will be open,
and he leavens their hearts againſt the other <hi>Magiſtrate,</hi> and then
what <hi>one</hi> will puniſh, or who <hi>one</hi> of them will puniſh, another will
uphold and in time ſeek a remedy, and complaines one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to him or them that are over them, and here the bond of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
is broken &amp; here begins <hi>ſtrife, diviſion</hi> and <hi>contention,</hi> and
<hi>heart-burning,</hi> &amp; waiting for iniquity one againſt another, and ſo into
<hi>rents,</hi> and <hi>partyes,</hi> and <hi>ſiding</hi> &amp; ſtil the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> blowes the fire, and
drives on furiouſly, and it may be, get ſuch a one to be caſt out,
and then he is diſſatisfied, and many more, they ſee it is but for
doing juſtice that he is ſo dealt withall, and then people feare how
they ſhall live or be governed, when honeſt men are caſt out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour,
and then whoſoever is found to queſtion ſuch things, and
the <hi>Miniſter</hi> (ſo called) heare thereof, he begins to threaten againe,
and here is a Yoak which cannot be borne, but people will break
it, though they break themſelves with it; And after this manner
have <hi>Nations, Countreys, Kingdomes,</hi> and <hi>Governments,</hi> been
pluckt up; and now I appeal to any <hi>unbiaſſed-man,</hi> whoſe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
is any thing open, whether theſe things, and much more
that might be ſpoken of this nature be not true? and whether the
men called <hi>Miniſters</hi> be at any time with any Government all
ſatisfied? and whether their ſiding do not lead people to ſide? and
whether there hath been any war in a Nation and the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> (ſo
called) had not the chief hand in it? and whether after one party
is worſted, they are not <hi>the firſt</hi> that comply to that <hi>perſon</hi> or <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
which before they might preach it <hi>damnable</hi> to <hi>joyne
with?</hi> and whether they be not the moſt <hi>Treacherous, Perfideous,
Changable, Deceitfull people</hi> of any <hi>ſort</hi> of <hi>men?</hi> and whether the
ground of all this be not the large <hi>maintenance</hi> which is ſettled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the <hi>Office,</hi> and ſo a Law <hi>to force it?</hi> This makes them afraid
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:43939:7"/>
on the one hand, leſt ſuch a Party <hi>will pluck it down,</hi> and ſo ſtir,
up ſtrife amongſt the other, becauſe <hi>they will hold it up;</hi> and when
that Party can hold no longer, then they are the firſt that turn <hi>to
the other,</hi> becauſe they may be by them held up; for if they may
be held up, there is no fear <hi>but to make them,</hi> or the <hi>moſt of them</hi>
of any <hi>Religeon</hi> that the <hi>Powers</hi> will eſtabliſh; as was manifeſtly
ſeen in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>6th.</hi> and Queen <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,</hi>
where many turned from being <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and
from <hi>Papiſts</hi> to <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> and <hi>in our dayes</hi> from the <hi>Common-prayer</hi>
to the <hi>Directory,</hi> and from the <hi>Directory</hi> to the <hi>Common-prayer;</hi>
and this is well known, The ſame that Preach'd up a <hi>King</hi>
for a <hi>Maintenance,</hi> Preach'd up a <hi>Common-wealth</hi> for a <hi>Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,</hi>
and a <hi>Protector</hi> for a <hi>Maintenance,</hi> and now a <hi>King</hi> for a
<hi>Maintenance:</hi> And ſo I ſay again, It is altogether <hi>inconſiſtant</hi>
with <hi>the ſafety of the people,</hi> and <hi>wel-being</hi> of the <hi>Ruler,</hi> or <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,</hi>
the <hi>upholding</hi> or <hi>maintaining</hi> a <hi>Miniſtry</hi> by a <hi>forced Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So then the way to preſerve the people in Peace and ſafety, and
the Government in ſecurity from danger, and to eſtabliſh it, is this,
<hi>To give unto every judgement</hi> (ſo called) <hi>tolleration in the matter
of his Worſhip towards God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And that every <hi>Society, Congregation,</hi> or <hi>judgement</hi> among
themſelves maintain their own <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> in and after what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
themſelves can or ſhall agree amongſt themſelves, and <hi>main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi>
their <hi>Places</hi> of <hi>Worſhip themſelves</hi> amongſt <hi>themſelves;</hi> ſo no
one ſort of people ſhould be burthened, nor their ſpirits grieved
and vexed by another: But this, in this particular fulfils the Law
and the Prophets, <hi>in doing as they would be done by;</hi> for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of every individual man and woman ought to be free unto
God, and none to have or claim <hi>Lordſhip</hi> over anothers conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
and ſo that <hi>Government</hi> that ſettles this, the people under
it (every one) watcheth for the good of <hi>them</hi> or <hi>him</hi> that <hi>governs;</hi>
becauſe by <hi>him,</hi> or <hi>them,</hi> they are kept in peace, and their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
free, and ſo this, every ſort of people, if they did but once
taſte a while, all people would delight therein; eſpecially thoſe
who fear God, and cannot be injurious, nor ſeek the hurt of their
Neighbours; and here every one <hi>might ſit under his own Vine, and
under his own Fig-tree,</hi> and this is ſo reaſonable a thing, and ſo
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:43939:7"/>
agreeable to the Scripture of truth, and to the Law of God written
in the heart, that if it were put in practiſe, all mouths would be
ſtopped, and <hi>envy</hi> durſt not open her mouth, and <hi>ſtrife</hi> would
ceaſe, and <hi>love</hi> and <hi>unity</hi> amongſt people would grow and increaſe,
and the Revengeful Murderous nature amongſt people would be
ſtarved and die within them; becauſe they would want the <hi>matter,</hi>
which is <hi>the Law,</hi> which forceth the conſcience to feed it. And
all they that now minde <hi>earthly things,</hi> that <hi>ſerve not the Lord
Jeſus Chriſt, but their own bellies,</hi> would be ſtopped, and have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to do, but to ſeek ſome <hi>honeſt calling,</hi> in which they might
<hi>labour,</hi> and be <hi>ſerviceable</hi> in the Creation: And here, none but
ſuch who in <hi>conſcience</hi> and <hi>zeal</hi> towards God would be <hi>Miniſters;</hi>
for ther's many who are now <hi>called</hi> by <hi>a great maintenance</hi> would
then be without <hi>a call</hi> to Preach; for this <hi>ſort of men</hi> do no good
at all to people, who labour for their Bellies. Who do they turn
from the evil of their wayes? But on the contrary they are ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fideous
and changeable, Preaching up ſo much <hi>Faction</hi> and <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi>
according to their ſeveral Fancyes, that they cauſe people to
be <hi>Truce-breakers;</hi> for whatſoever Government comes that will
ſerve their intereſt, and will <hi>do</hi> what they will <hi>have them, kill</hi>
whom they would <hi>kill,</hi> and <hi>ſave alive</hi> thoſe whom they would
<hi>ſave alive,</hi> that's preach'd up: But if any <hi>ſort</hi> or <hi>faction</hi> of
them be not countenanced, as that they cannot be, for one <hi>muſt go
down,</hi> if the other <hi>go up;</hi> then they ſet themſelves againſt that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi>
and ſecretly begins to ſmite, and ſo the ſame <hi>Government</hi>
which they preach <hi>up,</hi> and all <hi>Traytors</hi> and <hi>Rebels</hi> which ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
it, in a little time they Preach, and cry all <hi>Traytors</hi> and <hi>Rebels</hi>
that hold <hi>it up:</hi> And thus the people under them, are carried by
them.</p>
            <p>For now, were it not that there is ſo large a maintenance ſetled
upon them by a Law, which yet depends upon Authority; they
would not be ſuch Medlers with <hi>Authority,</hi> and cauſe ſuch <hi>Rents</hi>
and <hi>Diviſions</hi> amongſt people; but becauſe they are ſtill in fear of
loſing that, or that <hi>Authority</hi> will countenance thoſe whom they
fear, but if the Law <hi>were taken away that forceth the Maintenance,</hi>
then they that Preach, would Preach the Kingdom of God to
people, and turn people towards god, that their hearts might be
opened towards the Lord, and to his truth, that they that mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:43939:8"/>
might ſeek that which is loſt, and which is driven away, and
not ſeek the <hi>Fleece,</hi> and ſeek to kill and deſtroy; and ſo when
people were brought to God, and returned from their loſt eſtate,
they who were the Lords Meſſengers need not fear a maintenance,
<hi>For the Lord careth for Sparrows, and feedeth the Ravens;</hi> and
ſo theſe have little faith who cannot believe him, and caſt their
care upon him.</p>
            <p>And have they not proved <hi>falſe Prophets, Antichriſts, Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi>
to all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Powers</hi> that hath been within theſe few years?
Did not they Propheſie <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Proſperity</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> and his
<hi>Party,</hi> and did they not <hi>deceive him?</hi> And when they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
and the <hi>King</hi> ſuffered, and his Friends; did not they ſtart
aſide and preach <hi>Peace</hi> unto the <hi>Parliament</hi> againſt the <hi>Army,</hi>
calling them <hi>Rebels;</hi> and did they not deceive them likewiſe? And
then did not they turn to the <hi>Army</hi> and <hi>Protector,</hi> and Preach'd
<hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Proſperity</hi> to them, and deceived them likewiſe? And
now are they not turned to the <hi>King,</hi> and Preach <hi>Peace</hi> unto
Him, and ſet all their old ſervants at nought? Surely there is
not <hi>a more dangerous thing</hi> to the ſetling of a Government, then
the ſetting up of <hi>a forc'd Maintenance;</hi> and that is the thing that
the Lord expected ſhould long ſince been done away: The conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance
of which <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> and the many corrupt Lawes made
and continued to infringe the <hi>LIBERTIES</hi> of the <hi>CONSCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ENCES</hi>
of the free people of this Nation in their Worſhip to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
God, hath been the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of <hi>ſo many,</hi> and <hi>ſo great</hi> Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnings;
neither can there be any <hi>true peace</hi> and <hi>ſettlement</hi> in
theſe Nations, until theſe things are removed out of the way.</p>
            <p>For if a people were left free <hi>in their conſciences</hi> to worſhip
God according unto that which God makes manifeſt, then all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
of <hi>ſtrife</hi> touching <hi>Religeon</hi> were ended, and every one that
fears God ſatisfied, and the breach made up: And likewiſe, if all
<hi>forced Maintenance</hi> of <hi>Miniſters</hi> were taken off, then both <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi>
and <hi>Miniſtry</hi> were free, and ſo that occaſion of ſtrife would
ceaſe, and that breach made up, and here every one would watch
for the good of <hi>him</hi> or <hi>them</hi> that govern.</p>
            <p>And ſo ſuch a one, on whom the Lord laid <hi>a neceſſity</hi> to preach,
<hi>would preach,</hi> but they that preach only for a <hi>maintenance,</hi> who

cauſe of <hi>Strife, Debute, Diviſion,</hi> and <hi>Contention,</hi> as is before
ſhewed, their work would be ended, and then people would be
turned from the evil of their wayes, becauſe they that preach would
be in <hi>Gods Counſel,</hi> and in his <hi>power;</hi> for now what ever people
do imagine, they that will not preach without a maintenance
provided and ſetled by a Law, theſe preach for a <hi>maintenance,</hi> and

<hi>ſerve</hi> they <hi>Him</hi> but their <hi>Bellys,</hi> and never can teach the way to
life, or bring people into the way, but keep people out of the way,
though they may have many inticing words which mans wiſdome
teacheth; for every one that enters into Gods Kingdome muſt be
borne againe of the Spirit, and he that is borne againe muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten

with his <hi>Meſſage,</hi> but goes in his own <hi>Meſſage,</hi> and abuſes
his name for a maintenance, and the living mortall word he hath
not, which begetteth the birth that enters into Gods Kingdome,
becauſe he never ſent him, and ſo people are not profited, but
are kept out of the way to life by them, which hath the letter <hi>to
get a maintenance,</hi> but hath not the ſpirit <hi>which giveth life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now I have not inſtanced the ſeveral <hi>Governments</hi> and <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnings,</hi>
either to <hi>juſtify</hi> or <hi>condemne perſons,</hi> or to meddle

been thus brought to paſs, that ſo if the Lord give them under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,

but unto the Lord, who hath all power in his hands,
who in his Righteouſneſs and judgment for his own glory, hath
brought about theſe things; for I do believe that the judgments of
the Lord are Juſt and Righteous altogether, and therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
of the multitude of trangreſſions of this Nation, and becauſe
the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>his party</hi> lightly regarded the cry of the oppreſſed,
whoſe <hi>Conſciences</hi> (which is the Lords <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

oppreſſed, and greater Yoaks preparing by cruel Lawes; I ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:43939:9"/>
of <hi>theſe things</hi> was the <hi>hand</hi> of the <hi>Lord</hi> ſtretched out <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
them,</hi> and <hi>the party,</hi> who chiefly oppoſed him, being in their
hearts <hi>no better</hi> than <hi>the other;</hi> therefore they both long were a
<hi>ſcourge</hi> one unto another, and to the Nation; therefore did the
Lord raiſe up another party, whom <hi>both</hi> the other <hi>hated,</hi> who were
contemptible and inconſiderable, who as <hi>Inſtruments</hi> in the hand
of God did <hi>Wonders,</hi> and overcame <hi>both,</hi> as is well known: But
afterward they forgot the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> likewiſe, and turned againſt him,
and did not perform the Vowes and Premiſes which they had
made into the Lord in the day of their Diſtreſs, but corrupted
themſelves with the ſame abominations with which they were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted,
whom the Lord caſt out before them, and ſuffered many
of thoſe corrupt Lawes to continue in force, which they had many
times (in their diſtreſs) promiſed the Lord, that they would take
out of the way: To wit, <hi>That they would ſet the Conſciences of all
people free towards God, and remove the great oppreſſion of a forced
Maintenance for Miniſter;</hi> Which whilſt they did in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
perſiſt in, the Lord wonderfully delivered them, and cut off
thoſe that roſe up againſt them: But when power was put into
their hands, and they did not do thoſe things, but became <hi>corrupt,</hi>
and <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi> and <hi>vanity, ſuperſtition,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> grew
and increaſed; yet the Lord ſent his <hi>Meſſengers,</hi> calling them ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and ſending them often, warning them in the peril of their
lives; but they regarded them not, but ill rewarded the Lords Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers
by many cruel and hard Impriſonments, and by making yet
heavier Yoaks for their conſciences: Yet the long-ſuffering of the
Lord remained towards them, and not any of thoſe Powers which
the Lord overthrew, but he hath ſent this <hi>Meſſengers</hi> to warn them,
and to tell them in plain words what he was about to do; which
things are in great meaſure come to paſs, that all might know that
the Lord hath a <hi>Prophet</hi> in the Land, and likewiſe that they might
<hi>hear</hi> and <hi>fear,</hi> and <hi>learn Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now thus far hath the Lord wrought, and wonderfully
brought thoſe things to paſs, that every eye might ſee, that his
own hand hath done it, that he hath not ſuffered the ſound of the
weapons of war to be heard, what is it that the Lord doth now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite
of the men of this Generation? Friends, I beſeech you in
the fear of the Lord, conſider whether that the things which are
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:43939:9"/>
now wrought amongſt you principally and moſt of all be that which
the Lord expects, or whether he hath brought you up over your
Enemyes, becauſe you are more Righteous then they? or <hi>becauſe
of their unrighteouſneſs the Lord hath delivered them into your
hands,</hi> that you might execute his judgments upon them for their
Treachery towards him and his people? and whether the ſame God
hath not ſtill reſerved all power in his own hands, and can at his
pleaſure caſt you down, as well as lift you up? for this I ſay unto
you in the fear of God, think not that theſe whom the Lord hath
del<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>vered into your hands, were greater ſinners then you, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
ye repent, ye ſhall all likewiſe periſh. Do you believe that
the Lord takes delight in ſetting up of May-Poles, and for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thouſands to gather together in ſo many places, with whooping,
ſhouting, drinking, curſing and ſwearing, and all manner of Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs
and Licentiouſneſs? Is the Lord God honoured by theſe
things? is the King honoured by any of this? Conſider, hath not
the Lord viſited in iudgment this Nation, as I have before ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and overturned the workers thereof in former dayes, and do
you think he now approves of it? Do not deceive your ſelves,
God is not to be mocked; and do you think now ſince <hi>the Lord
hath overturned thoſe who formerly hath afflicted us,</hi> as he had
promiſed, and is rewarding them according to their works? Do
you think that you do God ſervice to kill us? Take heed of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any of our innocent blood upon you.</p>
            <p>And therefore this I ſay unto the <hi>King,</hi> who is now proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and that party who hath been for him conſtantly, I ſay unto
them, that we ought to be protected under him in <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>ſafety,</hi>
and in <hi>equity</hi> to have theſe juſt things granted which we ſtand for;
for now ever ſince the death of his Father, we have been as well as
him and them ſufferers under the powers that hath been ſet up,
and that eſpecially in the dayes of the <hi>Protector,</hi> ſince the name
of <hi>Quaker</hi> was given unto us: Who was there amongſt the many
<hi>ten thouſands</hi> that can now cry with their mouths, and their lips,
a <hi>KING</hi> a <hi>KING,</hi> make <hi>Bonefires</hi> and ſuch folly that durſt
open their mouths when he ruled <hi>to bear</hi> a teſtimony againſt <hi>his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion?</hi>
but joyned with him in his <hi>Government,</hi> and did pertake
<hi>with him</hi> in his <hi>oppreſſion,</hi> and cryed againſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> us in his eares, and
cauſed <hi>more cruel Lawes</hi> to be made againſt us then before, not a
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:43939:10"/>
Priſon I believe in this Nation free, but ſome or other of us have
been committed, and many of us as being <hi>dangerous</hi> to his <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi>
and yet theſe men I ſay, many <hi>ten thouſands</hi> of them
that have thus done, are the only men to cry up a <hi>KING</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
us as dangerous likewiſe to his Government, thus indeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to cover their <hi>own unrighteouſneſs</hi> by rendring <hi>us evil,</hi> never
ceaſing to ſeek our blood. For this let it be known unto you, that
we are not for <hi>Names</hi> or <hi>Titles,</hi> or for theſe names to ſet them up
above the nature of the thing, for it is the Magiſtrate that rules
for God, that executeth <hi>true judgment</hi> and <hi>juſtice</hi> in the earth,
who hath his eare open to the cry of the oppreſſed, and is ready
to break the ſtaffe and ſtrength of the <hi>oppreſſor.</hi> It is ſuch <hi>a one</hi>
whom God will honour, and whoſe Kingdome the Lord will eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh.</p>
            <p>Therefore friends do not hearken unto <hi>flatteries,</hi> and they who
for their own advantage ſpeaks fair, for they <hi>may deceive you,</hi> but
let your ears be open unto <hi>reproof,</hi> for that <hi>cannot hurt you:</hi> and
be not offended at any time with thoſe that ſpeak the truth? How
many thouſands have erred and periſhed by <hi>flatterers,</hi> but who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
that did hearken to <hi>reproof</hi> did amiſs? for now the things that
we are againſt <hi>is every appearance of evill,</hi> and the things that we
are for, <hi>is Righteouſneſs and juſt judgment,</hi> and unto this ſhall we
ſtand whatſoever may be our Portion, for why now may not we
as juſtly expect to be eaſed by the <hi>KING</hi> now the Righteous
hand of God hath removed them, by which both <hi>HIM</hi> and <hi>US</hi>
were ſorely afflicted, and ſince we both together ſuffered under
<hi>them,</hi> why is it not juſt that <hi>we</hi> with <hi>him</hi> ſhould enjoy <hi>our Liberty?</hi>
for indeed we cannot flatter with any, yet this we ſay, that there is
<hi>no people,</hi> nor <hi>no principle</hi> amongſt people profeſt, that doth <hi>tend
more,</hi> neither <hi>ſo much</hi> to the <hi>true honour</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> as we do, for
now it is they that fear the Lord, <hi>that truly honour the King,</hi> for
for (as I have ſaid) the <hi>King</hi> is not honoured <hi>where the fear of
God is wanting;</hi> But where the Subjects in a Nation walk in the
fear of God, and know <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> to rule
in their hearts, by which the <hi>Luſt</hi> (which is the ground of warrs
and ſtrife) <hi>which War in the Members comes to be deſtroyed and
ſubdued,</hi> ſuch can by no meanes be otherwiſe, but to the honour
of the <hi>King,</hi> for if the <hi>King</hi> rule for God, and layes the Sword
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:43939:10"/>
upon the <hi>evil doer,</hi> and praiſe ſuch <hi>who do well,</hi> which is Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance:
then ſuch who are in the Fear of God, and walk in Gods
Covenant, the Law written in the heart, <hi>theſe are the ſtrength</hi> of
the <hi>King;</hi> for his Sword is againſt the evil doer, and the evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
is not his ſtrength; for God who is the higher Power, hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
him to be a terrour unto the evil doer, and to praiſe ſuch
who do well; ſo the well doer is his ſtrength.</p>
            <p>For what is it that we deſire, which ought not to be granted in
reaſon and equity? The Thing that we deſire (as to our ſelves) is
no more then this, That under him we may live peaceably, and
Gods Spirit in us may have the exerciſe of our Conſciences
towards God in all things; That no Law be laid upon us to
force that from us which is our own; and in that caſe, both by the
Scripture of Truth, and the Law of God written in the Heart
ought to be at our own diſpoſe; to wit, to maintain a Miniſter
which we cannot own, or a Worſhip we cannot own, for <hi>the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
of the Conſciences of people, is Gods Prerogative alone,</hi> and
whoever meddles with that to exerciſe Lordſhip over anothers
Conſcience, he is a Uſurper and intrudes into anothers right, and
he falls upon the Rock that will grind him to powder; and <hi>which
hath done ſo by many,</hi> and if Gods Spirit have the exerciſe of the
Conſcience in all things, whoſe Spirit is a Sword to cut down
the Luſt that wars againſt the Soul inwardly, and deſtroys that in
man which cauſeth war and ſtrife without, and keeps the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
void of offence, both towards God and towards man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſuch ought not to be protected, and cheriſhed, and have the
<hi>Magiſtrates</hi> praiſe? And no otherwiſe do we deſire <hi>Protection,</hi>
but as we live <hi>peaceably</hi> in the exerciſe of a good Conſcience;
neither do we deſire theſe things <hi>only for our ſelves;</hi> but likewiſe,
<hi>that all others</hi> who deſire <hi>to live peaceably in all godlineſs, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
might enjoy Freedom and Protection;</hi> for a greater abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
or Idolatry cannot be committed, <hi>then for people to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
to Worſhip that for God,</hi> which <hi>they believe is no God,</hi> or to
<hi>Worſhip</hi> in the <hi>Way</hi> which they believe in their hearts <hi>is contrary
to God,</hi> or <hi>in which God is not to be worſhipped;</hi> for we do not
deſire, <hi>but that others</hi> (ſuch as I have ſaid) <hi>that will live peaceably
may every way partake of the ſame Liberty, which we deſire or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</hi>
He that hath <hi>a Goſpel</hi> to preach, <hi>let it be free</hi> like unto the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:43939:11"/>
               <hi>Goſpel of Peace,</hi> not <hi>for money</hi> or <hi>filthy lucre,</hi> that ſo people may
be turned from their evil wayes, and be brought <hi>from under the
power of Satan into the Power of God, that Righteouſneſs and juſt
Judgement, may run through the Nation as a mighty ſtream;</hi>
That ſo <hi>him</hi> or <hi>them</hi> whom God ſhall ſet up over this Nation, may
have his Throne eſtabliſhed, which cannot otherwiſe be eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
for, for want of theſe things hath the wrath of God been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed,
and his indignation poured out againſt theſe, who in the
day of his wrath, after the Lords Long-ſuffering was over, is now
juſtly manifeſted: And ſo now this is written in ſhort to no other
end, but that theſe things may be taken out of the way, which Gods
Wrath and Vengeance is againſt: That ſo the Wrath of God may
be turned away from this Nation, and that the <hi>Ruler</hi> or <hi>Rulers</hi>
thereof, might be firmly eſtabliſhed; and this is the true end, and
no other for which it is done.</p>
            <p>And now unto all thoſe who is honeſty of heart ſhall read this,
let them honeſtly conſider, that thoſe who are now ſet up, who were
of late <hi>Sufferers, exiled</hi> and <hi>baniſhed,</hi> that what deliverance is now
wrought is no way the price of their blood; for whilſt they ſtrove
that way, they were continually overthrown from time to time;
but that the Power and the Glory might be the Lords, and that all
might be returned unto him; the Lord hath made bare his own
Arm, &amp; hath brought this thing to paſs, that he himſelf might have
the Glory, and whether as well <hi>for our ſakes,</hi> whoſe innocent
blood-ſhed in the time of Peace within theſe laſt ſeven years, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Goals and other places can teſtifie, beſides the many beatings,
flockings, whippings, and cruel impriſonments of us, for nothing
but for crying againſt <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion</hi> in <hi>Rulers, Magiſtrates,
Prieſts</hi> and <hi>People.</hi> I ſay whether from thoſe multitudes of cruel
wrongs done againſt us by thoſe <hi>late Powers,</hi> we may not now
juſtly <hi>expect eaſe,</hi> and the <hi>redreſs</hi> of our grievance likewiſe, <hi>as
well as others,</hi> who then by the ſame powers were made ſufferers?
ſince it is ſo juſt and ſo reaſonable a thing, that we do deſire; we
ſeek <hi>no high Places, Promotion,</hi> nor <hi>Worldly glory</hi> amongſt
men: We ſeek <hi>no revenge</hi> as to <hi>our ſelves,</hi> upon any <hi>Perſon</hi> or
<hi>People,</hi> but that we may be <hi>protected</hi> in the exerciſe of <hi>our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi>
(which is the Lords Prerogative) in our Worſhip towards
God; and that we may be freed from all <hi>unjuſt Lawes</hi> that blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

with his own blood, that as <hi>Sojourners</hi> in our own Nation, we
might dwell in ſafety as to our outward man, as long as we live
peaceably, in all godlineſs and honeſty. And ſince the Lord hath
viſited you, and hath returned your Captivity, and is ſetting your
Feet upon the Neck of your Enemies, thus much doth the Lord
require of you, <hi>That you deliver His people, and unlooſe their
Bonds, and break every Yoak that oppreſſeth them;</hi> for this is all
that we deſire, that we may walk in the way of our God.</p>
            <p>And take heed unto your ſelves how you <hi>ſet up,</hi> or go about to

and now it is your time to work whilſt you have the day to labour
