         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <q>Sir, in your laſt book that you put out, you ſpend a great deale of paines in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
old ruſty Authors, to prove that Kings, Councels, Synods, and States, have
for ſo many hundred yeares medled with matters of Religion. I grant you they
have; but I demand of you, by what right, or by what authority out of the Word
of God they have ſo done? Hath God the Father, or Jeſus Chriſt his Sonne gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
them any allowance in this? Or have they not hereby rather fulfilled the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies
of the Scripture, which ſaith, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 17. That the Kings of the Earth ſhall
give their power unto the Beaſt till the Word of God be fulfilled, which
they have done in aſſiſting the <hi>Popes</hi> to joyne the Eccleſiaſticall and Civill
State together, making the Golden Lawes of Chriſt to depend upon the Leaden
Lawes of Man; yea upon ſuch Lawes, as was juſt ſuitable to their ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall
luſts, and which might the moſt advance their wicked ends and
deſignes: and in the doing of this, they have ſet up a perfect Antichriſt
againſt GOD'S CHRIST, yea, <hi>England</hi> is not free from this.</q>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:123470:9"/>
And to hold, that Kings, Parliaments, Synods, States, have any thing to do in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Religion and Church-Government, he concludes <hi>pag.</hi> 5. to be a ſetting of
the Potentates of the earth together by the eares with Chriſt (who is to rule all
Nations, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 5.) to pluck his Crown from his head, his Scepter out of his
hand, and his perſon out of his throne and State, that his Father hath given him

Particular Churches, members of a Kingdome and Nation, are not obliged in
point of Conſcience and Chriſtianity, to ſubmit unto whatſoever publike Church
Government, Rites, and Diſcipline, a Nationall Councell, Synod, and Parliament
ſhall conceive moſt conſonant to Gods Word, unleſſe it prove ſo in the whole
Kingdomes, Nations, and thoſe very particular Churches Judgement, <hi>pag.</hi> 8.
The grounds of <hi>Independent</hi> Government, attribute nothing to the Magiſtrate in
Church affaires further then the Magiſtrate is a member of their Churches and
Aſſemblies, <hi>pag.</hi> 12. You can no more Juſtifie a Nationall Church of Chriſtians
ſhall likewiſe go up to the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> from whence by the ſame Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie,
they are alſo to receive the Word of God, and not from Parliament, Pope,
Synod or Presbytery.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Henry Burton</hi> in his <hi>Vindication of Churches commonly called Independent,
&amp;c.</hi> p. 49, 50, 51, &amp;c: The Church is a ſpirituall kingdome, whoſe only King is
Chriſt, and not Man: It is a ſpirituall Re-publick, whoſe only Law-giver is
Chriſt and not Man. No man nor power on earth, hath a Kingly power over this
kingdome. No earthly Lawgiver may give lawes for the government of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick.
No man can or ought to undertake the government of this communion
of Saints. No humane power or law may intermeddle to preſcribe rules for the
government or form of this ſpirituall houſe. NOT COUNCELS, NOT SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NATES.
This is Chriſts Royall Prerogative, which is uncommunicable to ANY,
TO ALL THE POWERS ON EARTH, &amp;c. he adds, p. 60, 61.</p>
               <p>We challenge you to ſhew us, any Parliament, Councell, Synod, ever ſince the
Apoſtles, that could or can ſay thus, It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and us,
to determine controverſies of Religion, to make and impoſe Canons to binde all
men, &amp;c. Shew this to us at this time, and we will obey. But if you cannot, as
you never can; never let any man preſſe upon us that Scripture, that Synod,
which hath no parallell in the whole world, and ſo is no precedent or patterne,
for any Councell, Synod, Parliaments.</p>

                  <hi>A ſhort Anſwer to</hi> Adam Stewarts <hi>ſecond part of his over-grown Duply to the
Two Brethren; with certaine difficults questions eaſily anſwered:</hi> printed (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
licenſe) 1644. ſuppoſed to be written by Mr. <hi>Iohn Goodwin, p.</hi> 13, 17. But
perhaps you'l ſay, there is an Act of Parliament, a Civill law declaring hereſie,
or any different from the State opinions, ſuch as for the preſent are in faſhion to
be cenſurable by the civill power; I anſwer, not without all due reſpect unto the
lawes, and ſuch as made them, that if there be any diſtinction between a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
and a civill-ſtate, which all Chriſtians hitherto acknowledge, the enacting
civill lawes to puniſh ſpirituall offences, is not only a ſoleciſme or impropriety
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:123470:9"/>
in ſtate, but an incroaching on the Churches power, a profaning of the Keyes,
and injurious to the offender, who by this meanes is puniſhed both beyond the
degree and nature of his offence. If the bleſſed Spirit ſhould at any time bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
unto your ſpirit, or unto the ſpirit of a whole Parliament and Synod, what
were this to the ſpirits of other men? muſt not they wait with patience untill the
bleſſed Spirit be pleaſed to viſit their ſpirits likewiſe, before they can joyne with
yours or the Aſſemblies ſpirit? But if the Synods determination of this or that
controverſie ſhould ſeem good unto the holy Ghoſt, as the Churches decrees of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem
did, muſt they therefore be impoſed upon the Countrey, the whole
world? Is not this to equallize your Synodall Canons with thoſe decrees of the
Apoſtolicall Church of Jeruſalem, and to make Scripture of yours, as well as
theirs? is not this to adde to Scripture? nay, to alter it, <hi>p.</hi> 28. But if King and
Parliament may not force a new Religion or Sect, ſuppoſe Presbyterian, upon the
kingdome, much leſſe can the Synod, which neither has not yet pretends as is
alleaged, to uſe the materiall ſword? And if for matters of religion all power ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally
is in Chriſt, as you ſometimes acknowledge, How can King, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
or Synod, wreſt it from him? Nay what think you? is it not ſecondari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in the people, as well as civill power, which you affirme in the ſame page? and
ſo doubtleſſe is ſpirituall power, unleſſe you will make God to have provided
mankinde better of a ſafegard, or liberty to defend their bodies, than their ſoules:
If then the ſpirituall power be ſo inherently in the people next under Chriſt, as
that they cannot ſo well renounce and part from it in many reſpects, by what they
may of civill; how can it be thought by any one, that the King, Parliament, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod,
though never ſo much importun'd by a thouſand ſuch Aſſes, ſhould goe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
to ſettle a new Presbyterian Scotch government, with an intention to force
a conformity of the whole Kingdome, three quarters whereof cannot as yet be
thought to ſubmit unto it willingly or for conſcience ſake, <hi>Pag.</hi> 32, 33, 34, 35, 36.
<hi>Qu.</hi> 5. Is it not an ungodly thing to ſuffer men to be of any Religion? <hi>Anſ.</hi> No,
For both our Saviour his Apoſtles, and the Primitive Chriſtians did the ſame:
neither is it in the power of fleſh and blood to hinder it. <hi>Qu.</hi> 6. Is it not the moſt
unſeemely ſight to ſee the people of one Citty run ſeambling from their Pariſhes to
twenty Conventicles where ſo many ſeverall doctrines are taught? <hi>An.</hi> No, but
farre more monſtrous and abominable in the eyes of God, for people of twenty
ſeverall opinions for feare or favour to aſſemble and Joyn together hyprocritically
in one way of worſhip or Church diſcipline. <hi>Q.</hi> 8. Ought we not then at leaſt
to keepe our different opinions and Religion unto our ſelves in obedience to the
Civill Magiſtrate that commands it? <hi>An.</hi> No, becauſe it is better to obey God
then man. <hi>Qu.</hi> 9. If Jeſuited Papiſts and other ſubtile Hereticks be ſuffered, will
they not likely ſeduce many unto their erronious by-pathe? <hi>Anſ.</hi> Though a
Tolleration of erronious opinions may gaine ſome to ſathan, yet truth being
therewith to be publiſhed and improved will in all probabillity, not onely gaine
ſo many more to God; but any one thus wonne to God, unto his truth, is worth
thouſands of thoſe that fall from it. <hi>Qu.</hi> 10. But may not the multiplying of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies
ſtifle or expell the truth like as the abounding of tares and weedes often
choake the wheate and for this cauſe not to be permitted? <hi>An.</hi> Though it ſeeme to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:123470:10"/>
be many of the firſt, yet our Saviour in the parable of Tares. Math. 13. teaches us
a quite contrary doctrine, and forbids (Hereſies) the Tares to be pulled up before
[the day of Judgment] the harveſt. <hi>v.</hi> 30. 39. leaſt the wheate, the children of
the Kingdome true profeſſors, <hi>v.</hi> 30. 39. be therewith rooted up. <hi>Qu.</hi> 21. Is it not
a pious Act to compell a Company of careleſſe Idle people to heare a good ſermon,
to do a good worke whether they will or no; <hi>Anſ.</hi> No more pious an Act, then
for Papiſts to uſe the like compulſion towards Iewes and Proteſtants, inforcing
them to heare their ſermons, Maſſe, or Veſpers. <hi>Q.</hi> 24. May not the Civill Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
interpoſe to puniſh ſuch Church members with whom the ſpirituall by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of their refractorineſſe cannot prevaile? <hi>Anſw.</hi> Nothing leſſe, ſince the
Civill State or government has no more power, nor vertue to make a Papiſt turne
Proteſtant in England, then it can prevaile to make a Proteſtant become a Papiſt
in Spaine. <hi>Qu.</hi> 29. But can there be any hurt in forceing refractory people to be
preſent at Religious orthodox aſſemblies, where if they will, they may be infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
of the truth. <hi>An.</hi> Yes, firſt becauſe there can come no good thereof through
want of willingneſſe, which God onely reguards in him which is thus compelled;
and ſecondly, becauſe this (forceing) is a doing evill that good may come there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,

               <p>Maſter <hi>John Goodwins Theomathia, pag.</hi> 48, 49, 50. The generality and

of which the Independent Brethren conceive, an impoſſibility that a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall

of this ſecular root, who have no Authority nor power from Chriſt to nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
or appoint who ſhall be the men, that ſhall order the affaires of Chriſts
kingdome, or inſtitute the government of his Church; Therefore there is
an impoſſiblity that a legitimate Eccleſiaſticall power, ſhould according to the
minde of Chriſt, or any precept or preſident of Scripture be by them conferred
upon any man, or that the perſons ſo elected ſhould have a power by vertue of
ſuch nomination or election, to enact Laws or Statutes in matters of religion; &amp;

               <p>
                  <hi>Martyns Eccho</hi> proceeds in the like dialect, page 3. 4. 14. <hi>(ô divine pillage,

the Ordinance of Parliament upon him during his naturall life, like as our Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

then <hi>Martyn</hi> will ceaſe libelling againſt him: In the mean time you are to provide
that order may be taken, that the ſuperviſers make diligent ſearch and enquiry
after all <hi>conventicles</hi> and private meetings, &amp;c. for they are very dangerous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive

               <p>Many ſuch paſſages I find againſt the <hi>Ordinance for tythes;</hi> the very deſigne of
theſe libellous and ſeditious Sectaries being to incite the people to with-hold all
Tythes and maintainance from their Miniſters, and ſo to ſubvert the Miniſtery, that
none but their illiterate Tub-preachers may inſtruct mens ſouls; and this (I

THE NEW ORDINANCE <hi>(that none may preach that is not ordained Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi>
on purpoſe to make the Sectaries fly before us (to uſe the Doctors phraſe)
<hi>like lightning before the thunder.</hi> Their preaching in the Army is very deſtructive
to our Cloth; therefore the Ordinance was wiſely commended to his Excellency
Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> to be executed there, which occaſioned a pretty ſtory betwixt
an Engliſh-man and one of <hi>Jemmy's</hi> owne Countrymen: quoth the <hi>Scotch-man,</hi>
Man, is it fit that Colonell <hi>Cromwels</hi> Souldiers ſhould preach in their Quarters, to
take away the miniſteriall function out of the Miniſters hands? Why man (quoth
the <hi>Engliſh man)</hi> doe they ſo? quoth the Scotch-man, I ſay man it is a common
thing amongſt them; truly ſaith the Engliſh man, I remember they made a
gallant Sermon at <hi>Marſton-Moore</hi> neer <hi>York (where they were Inſtruments to ſave

<hi>(the late Ordinance that none may treach that is not ordained a Miniſter)</hi> is mad to

<hi>Coll. 1. 13. I abſolutely deny it, that</hi> your Miniſtery in England <hi>doth this: And
therefore I deſire you to declare, what you mean by</hi> Converſion, <hi>and prove your

<hi>which when you have done I ſhall further anſwer you by Gods aſſiſtance, and

build up their ſheep, as</hi> Acts 26. 1 Pet. 5. <hi>Yet I deny it, that</hi> your Miniſters <hi>do
it, for</hi> how can they build them up in that, which they themſelves are ignorant of,
and enemies unto? <hi>for as</hi> Jannes <hi>and</hi> Jambres which withſtood Moſes, <hi>ſo do theſe

2 Tim. 3. 8. And do feed you with huſks and Chaffe, being neither willing to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace

I have taken the pains by the</hi> Word of God, and demonſtrable Arguments grounded
thereupon, to prove the Church of <hi>England</hi> Antichriſtian: I do promiſe you, I will

part of which the Church of <hi>England</hi> is, and none of them ſhall periſh, but be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally

moſt obedient Son.</p>
               <p>Pag. 26, 27. Now from that which I have ſaid, I frame theſe Arguments:</p>
               <p>1. That Worſhip which is of the <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Antichriſts</hi> invention, inſtitution and
ſetting up, <hi>is no true Divine worſhip.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is of the <hi>Devils</hi> and <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts</hi>
invention,<note place="margin">Note.</note> inſtitution and ſetting up, as Revel. 13. doth fully prove.</p>
               <p>Ergo, <hi>the</hi> Worſhip <hi>of the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> England <hi>is no true</hi> Worſhip.</p>

neither is the true Religion, nor that it leads men the true way to ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Pag. 37, 38. I groundedly and abſolutely deny, that either the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
is, or ever was a true Church, and till you have proved it true, all the pains
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:123470:22"/>
that you have taken in proving that it is <hi>poſſible for corruptions &amp; evil livers to be in
a true Church,</hi> is ſpent in vain, and to no purpoſe, and I am confident, that you nor
none elſe will ever be able to prove the Church of <hi>England</hi> true, nor any other
Nationall Church: for <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> by his death did aboliſh the Nationall Church
of the <hi>Iews,</hi> with all their Laws, Rites and Ceremonies thereof, and in the New
Teſtament did never inſtitute no Nationall Church, nor left no Laws, nor Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
for the governing thereof, but the Church that he inſtituted, are free and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent
bodies, or Congregations, depending upon none but only upon Chriſt
their Head: Therefore Nationall Churches under the Goſpel are of Antichriſts,
<hi>that man of ſins</hi> inſtitution and ordaining, who only hath ordained Laws and Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
of his own for the governing of them; Therefore for you, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſay, and affirme, that this monſtrous, ugly, botched and ſcabbed body,
is Chriſts true Spouſe, is diſhonourable to his bleſſed being and Mediatorſhip.</p>
               <p>His Schiſmaticall ſeditious concluſion from all theſe Premiſes is this, <hi>pag.</hi> 35.
Therefore let all Gods people,<note place="margin">Note.</note> that yet are in the boſome of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
as they love their own inward peace, and ſpirituall joy, and look that their

their ſpiritual obedience and ſubjection from all Antichriſts Laws and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
and joyne themſelves as fellow Citizens of the City of God, to worſhip
and ſerve him in Mount <hi>Sion</hi> the beauty of holineſſe, and there only to yield all

               <p>This language and opinion of his, concerning our Engliſh Church, and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
is ſeconded by moſt Independents in their late Pamphlets; of which you
have had a bitter taſte in the preceding Sections, and their practice proves
as much.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For firſt, though they proclaime Liberty of conſcience to all Sects and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
whatſoever; yet they have ſo harſh an opinion of</hi> Presbyterians, <hi>and all
others, who ſubmit not to their</hi> Independent Modell; <hi>that they eſteem them no
better then Heathens,</hi>

to be their King; to whoſe perſons and infants, the very Sacraments and ſeals of

to un-Chriſtian, un-Church, un-Miniſter <hi>all</hi> Presbyterians, <hi>and to make them
caſt-awayes: If this be their charity to us already, what may we expect from
them hereafter if their Faction bear the ſway?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, when they gather any Independent Congregation, their practiſe is,
for their Miniſters ſolemnly to renounce and abjure their former Ordination in,
and the people their Priſtine Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and all
Congregations elſe, whereof they have been Members, and then to new-mould
themſelves into an Independent Church; which practiſe they have lately begun
in the Plantations of the Summer Iſlands; as a Friend of mine from thence infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

               <p>
                  <q>The Independent Church was ſet up here the laſt year, wherein they have

they then continued weekly Lecturers ſtill, yet as they ſaid, not as Miniſters,
but only as private men to exerciſe their gifts: wherein they laboured to draw o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
to joyn with them, and every week received in ſome: but that confeſſion of
ſins grew daily more and more out of date,<note place="margin">Such were fit to make Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</note> the rather for that * ſome were threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to be called in queſtion at the Aſſiſes for ſome things which they confeſſed
there; ſo that at this time all is in a manner implicite, and though little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
be expreſſed by the party to be received in, yet he is not put back: But
when they had gotten about thirty to joyne with them, they again called a Faſt
for all that would be preſent, where it ſeems having appointed one of our aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
Governors for their Prolocutor, he nominated Maſter <hi>White</hi> to be their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor,
which the reſt confirmed by erection of hands; then it ſeems Maſter <hi>White</hi>
nominated our other two Miniſters, Maſter <hi>Copland</hi> and Maſter <hi>Golding</hi> for his
ruling Elders, yet they continue to preach conſtantly as before, but Maſter
<hi>White</hi> only doth Adminiſter the Sacraments, and that only to ſuch as have joyned
themſelves in their implicite Covenant with them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Their practiſe therefore and their writings demonſtrate, what ungratefull

challenge all their Sects to equalize, or come near, what I have really perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
in this particular; ſo that if any man this day breathing in <hi>England</hi> deſerve an
<hi>Anathema Maranathae,</hi> from the Pope &amp; his party, I have more cauſe to expect itthen
any other: The whole Kingdom therefore will Proclaim him a notorious ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer
in this particular: He proceeds yet further, <hi>Surely</hi> (he writes, but his words
are no Oracles) <hi>you have given away your ears, and have ſuffered as a buſie-body
in oppoſing the King and the Prelats: without doubt all is not Gold that gliſters:
for were you not a man that had more then truth to look after, namely your own ends
and particular intereſts, which I am afraid you ſtrive to ſet up more then the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
good, you ſhould have importuned the Parliament to have continued their favour
and respect to that people, that cannot proſtrate their conſciences to mans devices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely my conſcience tells me, that I am free from this injurious calumny: For my
ears, I bleſſe God I gave them not away, but loſt them in a juſt quarrell, againſt all
Law and Iuſtice, as both Houſes of Parliament have unanimouſly adjudged:
But whether you did not juſtly loſe your ears for Sedition then, and deſerve
not to loſe he remainder of them (that I ſay no more) for your Seditious and
Libellious carriage now, is a great queſtion among your moſt intelligent friends:
For my oppoſing King and Prelates as a buſie-body, perchance it might be your
own caſe, it was never mine: What I have done againſt the unjuſt uſurpations,
and illegall exceſſes of either, I did it in a juſt and Legall way, upon ſuch grounds
and Authority, as was never yet controuled; and this I dare make good without
vainglory, that I have done more reall cordiall ſervice with my pen againſt the
Uſurpations of Regality and Prelacy, in defence of the Subjects Liberties, and
Parliaments juriſdiction, then all Independent Sectaries whatſoever, and that
only out of a zeal to Gods glory and the publick good, without the leaſt private
end or Intereſt, which never yet entred into my thoughts, having ſuffered as
much as any man of your Sect (if not more) for the Publick, without either ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
or receiving the leaſt recompence, or reward; having ſpent not only my
time and Studies, but ſome hundreds of Pounds in the Republicks ſervice ſince
my inlargement, without craving or receiving one farthing recompence in any
kinde; whereas if I had ſought my ſelf, or been any way covetous or ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
I might perchance have obtained as advantagious and honourable prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as any Independents have aſpired to, if not challenged as their right, for
leſſe meritorious publick ſervices and ſufferings then the leaſt of mine. As for
my importuning the Parliament for continuance of their favours to that people
you ſpeak of; ſurely when I finde them more obſequious to the Parliaments juſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:123470:25"/>
and commands, leſſe willfull and more conſcientious; I ſhall do them all
the offices of Chriſtian love; but whiles contumnacy, obſtinacy, licentiouſneſſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitableneſſe
and Schiſme are moſt predominant in them, the greateſt favour I
can move the Parliament to indulge them, is to bridle theſe their extravagances
with the ſevereſt Laws, and to prefer the publike ſafety of Church and State,
before their private Lawleſſe conceits and phantaſticall opinions.</p>
               <p>He addes, <hi>That I am in this as cruell a Task-maſter as</hi> Pharaoh: <hi>and that the

               <p>This Libeller being queſtioned before the <hi>Committee of Examinations</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this Letter, by their ſpeciall favour returned his <hi>Reaſons</hi> why he ſent it in

               </p>
               <p>In this new unlicenſed Paper, firſt he vaingloriouſly relates his own ſufferings

eſpecially my <hi>Truths Triumphing over Falſhood;</hi> which being ſubſequent in time
to all the particulars he recites, could certainly be no occaſion of them; and
therefore he playes not only the <hi>Sophyſter,</hi> but <hi>Slanderer</hi> in this particular.
Fourthly, <hi>pag.</hi> 5, 6. He miſrepeats, and miſapplies ſome Paſſages of mine, to all of
his Sect in generall, and to HIMSELF and SVCH AS HE IS in the
ARMY and ELSEWHERE: Whereas there is not one Syllable in my
Paſſages to that purpoſe, but only againſt ſome particular Authors <hi>I</hi> there mention,
and ſuch of their Confederates, who maliciouſly and audaciouſly oppugne the
undoubted Rights, Priviledges, and juſt Proceedings of Parliament, contrary to
their Solemne Covenant, League, and Proteſtation; and if you proclaim your

               <p>To this I might adde a whole bundle of <hi>Calumnies and injuries</hi> againſt me in

for denying obedience to Parliament and Synod in ſuch a caſe? Whether the pretence of

in me lay, as though our Countreys peace reſted wholly upon the planting of this

they feign it to the Church of <hi>New England,</hi> which, as they ſay, is the pureſt

but their ſaying not their doing. But grant that they were in their way aright,

they his ſervants, and Chriſt their Lord, it refteth on them in his behalfe to doe

               <hi>that Parliament and Synod can eſtabliſh no other Church Diſcipline or

making divers people both objects and ſubjects openly to work

againſt divers perſons, as though they had both ſwords in their owne
power, or as though they had abſolutely knowne Gods ſecret decree; and
this hath beene held for ſound and good Orthodox Doctrine, when divers have
repented of their hearing; and theſe not once nor twice, but often. Infinite
might I relate, even from their owne mouthes, which would make wiſe men
admire, but I muſt paſſe over them to avoyd tediouſneſſe to my ſelfe, and
trouble to you. And that in your wiſedome you may the better conceive of
this their Church, The firſt beginning was a certaine Feaſt, held every week
at ſeverall houſes, which Feaſt they called a <hi>loblolly Feaſt;</hi> which for the
common fare of our Countrey is as our watergruell in <hi>England,</hi> ſo they would
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:123470:34"/>
have it but of a common food; at which Feaſt each did ſtrive to excell ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in the difference of making it: after they had once gotten a certaine num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
unto them, and ſo of an ordinary food they made it extraordinary; yea
ſo extraordinary, that ſome in few meetings were forced to ſell the feathers
out of their bedding,<note place="margin">Note</note> for milk, butter, and creame to feed them withall, and
to make their Loblolly the more dainty and toothſome; others againe to
maintaine this Feaſt, for one dayes entertainment, themſelves and whole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
muſt pinch for it two or three months after; by which Feaſt, by the ſhew
of neighbourhood or Feaſt of Love, though never none was found, in ſhort
time they encreaſed in every pariſh to a pretty number. At which Feaſt alſo
their bellies and ſtomacks being well gormondized, the Miniſter propoundeth
certaine queſtions unto them by way of catechiſing of his owne framing, for
halfe an howre; which each had in writing one from another, and like Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers

with an unanimous conſent, they joyne their forces for the erecting and eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
this their Church; and then in ſtead of catechiſing youth, they
would catechiſe ancient people young and old of both Sexes: This they could
not well accompliſh, being by divers withſtood; but ſeeing they could not
bring that to paſſe, then would they not ſuffer any to communicate without
examination before, and that as well Beleevers as others, yea them eſpecially,
though never ſo learned and ſufficient, which bred a ſore broile amongſt us;

               <hi>Then denied they to baptize children, unleſſe the Parents rehearſed the

ſaying, <hi>had I power and approbation, I would ſhake the whole fabrick thereof;
this was taken very heynouſly.</hi> But to let paſſe other things contained therein,
come we to the work, where firſt <hi>I maintained our Church of</hi> England <hi>againſt

never will be, comparing our Church with all other reformed Churches, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:123470:35"/>
their defects and deformities. Secondly by <hi>ſeven wayes I maintained the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe
and the neceſſity of baptizing Infants,</hi> where I anſwered divers objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and theirs alſo unto me in number fourteen, and laid
downe their objections ſeverally.</p>
            <p>Thirdly and laſtly, I ſhewed who of neceſſity were bound, and therefore
ought to baptize infants, namely thoſe to whom God had given the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Word and Sacraments, that is, ſuch as God hath called to the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteriall
function, and endued them with gifts and graces anſwerable for their
Callings, ſuch and none but ſuch ought to meddle in the word or Sacraments;
here I ſhewed the duty of all who had children to baptize only to ſuch, and to
none but ſuch: then next, the duty of Miniſters, they being ſo ſought to; they
ought, they muſt baptize them: next I confuted and condemned certain here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and ſchiſmaticks that denied and refuſed to baptize infants, and namely
themſelves; and laſtly concluded with a friendly exhortation to all Miniſters
to be carefull to perform their duty in this, and in all other points. This in

we will never forſake this way, but whatever they ſay or teach we will build our

Things comming into my minde one after another, cauſeth me not to ſet
them downe ſo exactly in order as they hapned, but ſomewhat confuſedly:
I ſhould have told you at firſt, this man, Mr <hi>White,</hi> was by the Company of
<hi>Adventurers</hi> ſent over ſome yeares ſince, Miniſter for our two Tribes, <hi>Pem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook</hi>
and <hi>Devon,</hi> and by the Earle of <hi>Dorſet</hi> then Governour, with the whole
Company, they bound him in a bond of <hi>two hundred pound ſtirling to live
with us peaceably and quietly, and to follow the Orders and Diſcipline of our
Church for the ſpace of three yeares after his arrivall;</hi> which argued he was
a man of a turbulent ſpirit in the place where he was, at <hi>Knights bridge</hi> neare
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Independents formerly as Epiſcopall and Ceremonious as Presbyters.</note> ; during <hi>this time of his bonds he was at hot a zealot as poſſible
might or could be, both for the Book of Common-Prayer, as alſo for all other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
of the Church, as kneeling at the Sacrament, Croſſe in Baptiſme, Ring
in the Marriage, and all other things whatſoever, ſo long at his bonds laſted:
But ſuddenly after he turned upſide downe,</hi> and after foure yeares hee began
theſe things; and ſeeing he could not accompliſh his deſire with us, he made
ſhewes of leaving us and goe to another Charge that was vacant, unleſſe
<hi>we would ſue unto him by</hi>

ſaith, <hi>is able to deceive the very Elect, by their walking in ſheeps clothing; but

that is, by their Doctrines, the which however it ſound good to ſimple people,
and is as honey in their mouthes, <hi>but ſure I am, they tend only and wholly to

who cutteth wood over his head, is in danger of the chips flying in his face;
ſo fareth it with me, I having beene an oppoſite againſt them, both by ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king

have from time to time traduced me: and as the caſe once was yours, ſo is it

               <p>I Know you are not ignorant of the rent or diviſion here begun, which
though I beleeve (as you have often teſtified) you favour not, yet
through your gentleneſſe and forbearance towards the Authours and
Abetters; It growes very ſtrong, and is like to prevaile; which <hi>I</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
you know not, but may further underſtand if you be pleaſed to make
enquiry, and to heare other men. For mine owne part <hi>I</hi> frame not this
as a complaint or accuſation againſt them, being but one man, and the
matter concerns all; beſides <hi>I</hi> have ſeene the ſucceſſe that others have
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:123470:38"/>
had that wayes, and <hi>I</hi> know they are too ſtrong a party for me or any

loſt by my ſilence <hi>I</hi> might ſeem to conſent unto it, <hi>I</hi> thought it
neceſſary to give notice, and to endeavour what in me lies to prevent it,
whatſoever may befall me for ſo doing.</p>
               <p>Therfore <hi>I</hi> have written this Advertiſement following, which I could
wiſh might come to the hands of all. The intent and ſcope wherof is, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite
and perſwade all to a ceſſation from ſetting up any new diſcipline and
government amongſt us untill we heare what is decreed by the Honorable
Aſſembly of Parliament: Or if that cannot be obtained (as I have ſmall
hope, conſidering how eagerly they purſue their ends, and how great a
number they have gayned to their party) yet that the authours would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſse
punctually in writing, what manner of Diſcipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
it is which they would ſet up.</p>
               <p>And becauſe (it may be) they will ſay, that they have already expreſt
it in their Sermons, eſpecially in their Lectures ordayned for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
therefore <hi>I</hi> have ſet down thirty or more doubts of ſpeciall moment
which they have not yet cleared. Neither is it fit that our Religion or
this part of it (which they would ſeem to make a principall part) ſhould
remain in their breaſts only, for ſo they may adde, detract, or alter, as
they pleaſe; but ought to bee fully expreſt in writing. And <hi>I</hi> beleeve
they are ſcarce agreed themſelves touching all points of their intended
Diſcipline; which you may perceive if you pleaſe to examine them ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally,
according to theſe or ſuch other queſtions, as you ſhall think
fit.</p>
               <p>Therefore in the firſt place (according to my duty) I humbly preſent
this Advertiſement to the conſideration of your Worſhip and your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,
to whom God hath committed the Government of this place, and of
all perſons here, and of whom he will certainly require it, if ſuch an evill
as is threatned ſhould befall through your neglect. For although the
great Antichrist and his Clergy did prevaile to perſwade Chriſtian
Princes and Magiſtrates, that the Government of the Church and care
of Religion pertained not to them, but to the Clergy, and the like, is
now here preached amongſt us: yet I verily truſt, you entertain no ſuch
falſe principle. For, to eſtabliſh true Religion, to maintain it, and to
ſee that the duties of Religion be duly performed to God and man, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all that the Law requireth, and ſo is almoſt (if not all) the duty of
the Chriſtian Magiſtrate. And this being taken from him, and put
upon the Clergy, he may ſerve as an officer to execute what the Clergy
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:123470:38"/>
ſhall decree, but ceaſeth in a manner wholly to be a Magiſtrate. Thus

               <head>An Advertiſement to ſuch here as have care
of the Conſervation of true Religion.</head>
               <p>IT is and ought to be the principall care of every good Chriſtian, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
the knowledge and exerciſe of true Religion in himſelfe and others,
being <hi>the one thing neceſſary.</hi> But from this theſe times have much declined
everywhere; and even in our deare native Countrey, ſo farre as called for
a ſpeedy Reformation, or threatned ruine. And ſeeing little hope of the one,
the latter was juſtly feared by many, and by my ſelfe (I confeſſe) amongſt
others, being the principall cauſe of my comming hither. But the Lord hath
mercifully ſtayed thoſe feares, and given us freſh hopes by the Reformation
in ſo great a meaſure begun by the preſent Parliament, which alſo they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
through many difficulties to accompliſh more fully. And conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
how worthily they have begun, and what great things they have ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
above all expectation, we have no cauſe to miſ-doubt them, nor to
anticipate their Honourable proceedings, but rather to attend what ſhall be
determined by them; eſpecially conſidering that wee of this place, as wee
have not beene much burthened, except by ſome Miniſters; ſo now we are
altogether unburthened of the Ceremonies, and whatſoever elſe hath uſually
beene offenſive to good Chriſtians in <hi>England.</hi> For if we ſhould ſet up a new
Government or Diſcipline and forme of Religion here, wee muſt alter it
againe when wee underſtand out of <hi>England</hi> what forme the Parliament
have or ſhall eſtabliſh: Some ſay no, our Miniſters are as ſupreame heads
under Chriſt of their ſeverall Churches here, and not ſubordinate in theſe
things Eccleſiaſticall, to Parliament or any other power upon earth whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever:
but this opinion ſavors too much of Antichriſtian pride and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Others ſay, the Parliament will eſtabliſh the ſame forme that our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
will ſet up here; but theſe conjectures doe much wrong that Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Aſſembly; for if the matter were ſo eaſie and evident, that our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
here can preſently determine it; then what need the Parliament ſo
long to debate and conſider of it? What need ſuch conſultation with the
ableſt Divines in <hi>England,</hi> and many other from all parts? And why hath
there beene ſuch difference of opinions touching this matter even amongſt the
moſt godly and learned in Chriſtendome for theſe 100 years together.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:123470:39"/>
I remaines therefore, that wee muſt change againe when we heare from
thence, and conſidering what changes have beene made by ſome already, if
we ſhould now make another change in ſetting up a new Diſcipline, and
ſhortly after another when we heare out of <hi>England;</hi> ſuch mutability would
neither be ſafe for this place, not ſuteable to the ſtedfaſtneſſe of the Church

not be through levity, nor of an high minde, nor for ſelfe ends. A reſtleſſe
levity, and that with contempt of Authority, under pretence of greater
and new lights, is a dangerous ſigne of an Anabaptiſticall ſpirit. Therefore
I ſay, what we change, ought to be done <hi>with the feare of God and the King.</hi>
In the feare of God, namely according to his <hi>Word;</hi> and with the feare of
the <hi>King,</hi> that is, conſenting with the Lawes and Soveraigne Authority ſet
over us; or at leaſt not with an high hand in contempt thereof; <hi>For every

               <p>Therefore I could wiſh (as I have often perſwaded) that wee might ſtay

                  </gap> them. But becauſe ſome
here are very impetuous, and a further change is daily preached and preſſed
amongſt us, I have little hope to ſtop the violence of this ſtreame. Therefore
to the intent we may underſtand and conſider what to doe, and (as the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is) look before we leap, I ſhould in the next place deſire, as many others
doe, and as it concerns us all to deſire of them, and of our Miniſters eſpecially,
that they would be pleaſed to ſet down in writing,<note place="margin">Note</note> whatſoever new thing

               <p>I know there are ſundry Objections alleadged and pretended, more then

in ſome things. And further, that all foure of our Miniſters concluded of a
new Diſcipline, and new courſes of edification, whereof two being gone into
<hi>England</hi> to agitate the buſineſſe there with their friends, and in Parliament:
God hath ſent another from <hi>Providence</hi> almoſt miraculouſly, who was not
of their counſell, and yet doth approve of all their proceedings, and as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
preſſe them as the reſt. Beſides (ſay they) all the chiefe profeſſours
in the Countrey are for the ſame; yea the chiefe Authority in the Iſland, next
the Governour. So that all things thus concurring, ſhewes (ſay they) that
there is an extraordinary hand of God in the effecting of it; and therefore
wee ought quietly to yeeld our ſelves to them, leaſt wee reſiſt even God
himſelfe.</p>
               <p>Theſe (I ſay) and other the like arguments in this caſe,<note place="margin">Anſwer</note> however they
may prevaile much with ſome that have other foundation for their Religion
beſides the Scriptures; yet to an underſtanding man they will eaſily appeare
to be of ſmall value, as would be more evident in anſwering them particularly,
which I ſhall readily doe if it bee needfull. But having no purpoſe here to
diſpute, but rather to invite to a ceſſation from theſe occaſions of ſtrife and
controverſie, or at leaſt wiſe to a due conſideration of what we doe; I ſhall
only anſwer in generall. It is a ſaying of Divines agreeable alſo to the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience
of good Chriſtians, That Satan never tempts more dangerouſly whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by himſelfe or others, then when he doth moſt perſwade us not to reſiſt
his temptations, but to yeeld our ſelves to them; And even the Lord himſelfe

               <p>I have read in ſome Hiſtory of the Weſt-Indies, that about 100 yeares
ſince or more, the Iland <hi>Vianis</hi> (which ſome of our men are now gone to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover)
and all thoſe Ilands thereabout were Inhabited by certain <hi>Indians,</hi>
which for ingenuity and feature ſurpaſſed many others; theſe held the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality
of the ſoule, and thought that when it departed the body, it went
to a kinde of Purgatory, which they ſuppoſed to be the cold Northern Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines
congealed with froſt and ſnow; where after it was ſufficiently purged,
it went from thence into countreys more Southerly, and there abode for
ever, enjoyning a thouſand delights and pleaſures. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> having
knowledge of this opinion of theirs, and wanting men to work in their gold
mines, came thither with Ships from <hi>Hiſpaniola or Cuba</hi> (which are to
the Southward) and making ſome goodly ſhew, told theſe ſilly <hi>Indians</hi> that
they were come from the Southern parts, places of great felicity, where
the ſoules of all their Anceſtors and friends departed were in all joy and
happineſſe; and they were now come to tranſport them immediately thither,
that they might never come at all into that Purgatory in the Northren parts:
Theſe ſimple people being dazelled with the conceit and imagination of theſe
things, could not forethink their danger at hand, but came flocking to the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> in great numbers; who when they ſaw their opportunity ſet ſaile,
and carryed them thence to their gold mines, where they were ſoone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
with grievous ſervice and ſlavery. In like ſort it concernes us not
to be ſo much tranſported with any glorious pretences of ſome great tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
freedome and felicity at hand, as to be drawne in any ſort from the
Church of <hi>England,</hi> eſpecially as it is now reformed and in reforming, but
to know fully of thoſe that would draw us whither they would have us goe,
and upon what grounds, that ſo we may ſearch the Scriptures, and throughly
examine thoſe grounds thereby.</p>
               <p>God hath delivered our Nation (as many others in Chriſtendom) from
under the bondage of the great Antichriſt, we have not prized this delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
nor made that uſe of this liberty, nor thoſe many mercies and bleſſings
accompanying it that we ought. And conſidering our great abuſe of Gods
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:123470:40"/>
favours, and in particular the ſinnes of this place in all ſorts, Magiſtrates,
Miniſters and people, and eſpecially the evident unſoundneſſe of thoſe that
are Profeſſors here: It were juſt with God whilſt we look for light to ſend
us darkneſſe, and whilſt we propoſe to our ſelves the ſpeedy ruine of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt,
great freedome and glorious times (all which the Lord can effect in
his due time) wee fall our ſelves into another ſervitude and bondage per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
as grievous as the former, under petty Antichriſts. For if that grand
Antichriſt come down (as we have good hope) and a company of Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
ſhould ariſe (whether Miniſters, or who elſe) that ſhould as it were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
his kingdome among them, by aſſuming every one to himſelfe ſuch a
like power over his Church, or the people committed to his charge as the
grand Antichriſt uſurped over the Catholique Church, and that as he did
<hi>lure Divino</hi> (which they pretend) ſurely they would become ſo many petty
Antichriſts, and the Church ſhould be brought into ſervitude and thraldome
as before.</p>
               <p>And indeed, as the errour to which the Iewes were moſt inclined in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall,
was to ſet up other gods, that is falſe gods, attributing ſomething to
them which was proper to the true God: So the errour to which Chriſtians
in generall are moſt inclined, is to ſet up falſe Chriſts; that is Antichriſts of
the Clergy, attributing ſomething to them that is peculiar to Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
or to his Church, which is Chriſt myſticall; As was foretold by the
Apoſtles, and is evident by the experience of all Ages ſince Chriſt: And of
which our Saviour himſelf ſeems to give warning,<note place="margin">Matth. 24. 24.</note> when he ſaith; <hi>For there ſhal
ariſe falſe Chriſts and falſe Prophets, and ſhall ſhew great ſignes and wonders,

               <p>Its like they will ſay, they are no ſtrangers, they have lived long here.
But as we know one of them came by an accident very lately; the other two
though they have been long among us, yet they are in a manner ſtrangers to
us, for they are not the ſame men that formerly they were, having changed
their opinions and practiſes in many things that we know, and it is like in
many other things that we know not, and how farre they will proceed, and

               <p>If they ſhall ſay (as ſome pretend) that the Government and Diſcipline
which they would have us entertaine, is of it ſelfe evident by the word of
God, to every one whoſe eyes are not blinded by the god of this world, &amp; that
they have declared it already in their Sermons, eſpecially in their weekly
Lectures, which it ſeemes they have inſtituted for that purpoſe: As hee that

of this building, namely, ſuch and onely ſuch as could bring good teſtimony
of their converſion and holy converſation: And he was now to ſhew the
forme and order to bee obſerved in every particular Church, and how each
one was to be Superiour or Subordinate to others (though he did not this at
that time ſo farre as I underſtood.) The ſame things or to the ſame purpoſe
were againe repeated in the fourth Lecture. But I ſay, all this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
the things are of themſelves obſcure and doubtfull; which doubts
they have not taken away, but rather encreaſed. Some of which doubts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
many, I will here ſet down, not raiſed from ſpeculations of things
afarre off, and not like to trouble us, but ſuch as ariſe from that which
is frequently preached and preſſed or practiſed amongſt us. In which though
I endeavour to underſtand things in the beſt ſence, yet becauſe they expreſſe
not themſelves plainely, I may miſtake their meaning in ſome things, and

ſtill be tied to anſwer according to that Catechiſe of Mr <hi>Oxenbridges,</hi> called
<hi>Babes Milke,</hi> or ſome other?</p>
               <p>Theſe three practiſes as they have been uſed here, being as I conceived their
own inventions, and not grounded on the word of God, nor the examples of
the Primitive or other Reformed Churches, nor on the Lawes of our Land,

at their firſt comming up; namely, by teſtifying both privately and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
my diſlike of them, and the reaſons why: But eſpecially the laſt more
at large, whereunto I was moved by Mr <hi>Iohn Oxenbridge,</hi> who took upon
him to write a defence of this practiſe of univerſall Catechiſing all men and
women, and of true Beleevers in ſpeciall; and to anſwer the Objections
which I had made againſt it. But what he hath performed, and how well
beſeeming his worth and reputation, I leave to the j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>dgemnt of ſuch as have
or ſhall peruſe my Confutation of that his Defence and Anſwer, where I have
put them together: Touching theſe three practiſes, I ſhould move ſundry
queſtions, but that it ſeemes they are all laid down of late, and as it is thought
will not be taken up againe, therefore we ſhall paſſe them over, that we may
come to thoſe new things which they urge now.</p>
               <p>4. Whether this Diſcipline and forme of Religion, which they would ſet up,
be the ſame in all points of moment with any other Reformed Church
whatſoever, except perhaps in <hi>Providence,</hi> where it had no ſuch ſucceſſe as
ſhould induce us to embrace it. If they ſay, yes, in <hi>New-England,</hi> we are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
doubtfull of that, (not knowing certainely what is practiſed there) the
rather for that ſome have endeavoured to eſtabliſh univerſall Catechiſing here
upon that ground ſaying, it was generally uſed there, which appears not to be
true: Beſides, if ſuch a Diſcipline be there, it is no leading example to us, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
becauſe they have had no long experience of it, and partly becauſe there may
be much difference between the people there and here; for if all Magiſtrates,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:123470:42"/>
Miniſters and People were eminent in piety, we need not much care what
Government were uſed, no, though it were wholy Arbitrary, for none
would injure another (and to this condition the Churches in the Apoſtles
times ſeeme neareſt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pproach.) But here where it is farre otherwiſe, and
in other places in generall, men muſt be wary what Diſcipline and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
they ſet up, preſuppoſing it muſt come into evill mens hands as well
as good, yea, and that more often.</p>
               <p>5. Whether this Diſcipline be fully ſet down by any ſound Divine, and
not rather framed by themſelves, borrowing from ſeverall Churches, and
ſeverall Divines, what will beſt ſerve their turne? And whether our three
Miniſters agree in all points touching the Diſcipline they would have us
embrace?</p>
               <p>6. What ſeverall Offices, and how many Officers ſhall be in every Church,
and how ſubordinate one to another? And whether the Miniſter ſhall not
be the chiefe of thoſe Officers, or as it were the ſupreme Moderator or
Governour of them all, without whom nothing ſhall bee eſtabliſhed, and
alſo to have the principall hand in putting in and putting out theſe Officers?
for ſo they ſeeme to intimate.</p>
               <p>7. Whether this Miniſter and his Officers will govern and cenſure the
reſt according to ſome lawes or in an Arbitrary way? and if in an Arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
way, to whom ſhall they appeale if they have wrong? And who ſhall
queſtion and judge the Miniſter if he decline from the truth, or be a wicked
liver? And whether this bee not like to prove a very tyrannicall government
if it come into evill hands, which muſt be preſuppoſed?</p>
               <p>8. If they will govern and judge according to ſome lawes; what be thoſe
lawes? whether ſome already extant, or ſome others which they will frame,
and who they be that ſhall frame theſe lawes? and what ſhall be the ſeverall
penalties or cenſures for Delinquents?</p>
               <p>9. What tryall (in things of importance) the party accuſed ſhall be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed?
The Common Law of <hi>England</hi> (to avoyd tyranny and injuſtice,
to which the corrupted nature of man is much inclined, and even of Clergy
men as well as others) allowes a tryall by 12 indifferent men, which are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and free men, of good ranke, having no dependance, nor are in feare of
the Iudge, nor beare no ill will to the party accuſed, but ſuch as are like to
deale impartially, and that upon Oath. Whether he ſhall have that or ſome
other ſo faire a tryall?</p>
               <p>10. What things they be which they will undertake to judge of? and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any thing ſhall bee wholy reſerved to the judgement of the Civill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate?
or whether the party offending, or the matter in controverſie, ſhall
be puniſhed or judged of both, namely, by the Civill Magiſtrate, and alſo
by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               <p>11. If they ſay they will judge only of Eccleſiaſticall matters, what are thoſe
matters Eccleſiaſticall, and how exempted from the juriſdiction and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the Chriſtian Magiſtrate? For the Pope and Biſhop obtained of Kings
that ſundry things might bee called Eccleſiaſticall, and ſo belong to their
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:123470:42"/>
ſpirituall Courts (as they call them) which are no more Eccleſiaſticall then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
matters which belong not to them.</p>
               <p>12 Whether theſe Miniſters and other Officers ſhall be judged by the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Magiſtrate in all things as other men? or how farre forth they ſhall bee
under his juriſdiction and authority, and how farre forth exempted?</p>
               <p>13 From what places of Scripture is ſuch a form of Government deduced,
juſtified, or allowed?</p>
               <p>14 Who ſhall be the other members conſtituting theſe intended Churches,
and who ſhall be excluded from them? To this all or ſome of them at leaſt
ſeem to anſwer expreſly, that they ſhall conſiſt only of ſuch as are truly rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
and can bring ſufficient teſtimony of their converſion and holy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;
and all others ſhall be excluded as Heathens, Cananites, Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans,
&amp;c.</p>
               <p>15 And ſeeing they have ſaid ſometimes, and will, I ſuppoſe, grant, that
not one fourth part, nor it may be, one tenth part of the people here or in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
are able to bring ſuch ſufficient teſtimony of their true converſion and
holy converſation, and thereupon ſhall be excluded Chriſtian ſociety, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
as aforeſaid, whether this will not breed a moſt dangerous diviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Church and Common wealth, threatning the ruine of both?</p>
               <p>16. I ſuppoſe they cannot but be ſenſible in part, and foreſee the
deſperate
iſſues of ſuch a Separation; and therfore it would in the next place be known,
whether they intend not to ſalve it by ſome politick courſe, contrary to theſe
principles, and what good policy can be uſed to this purpoſe? For mine own
part, I can think of none; for either they muſt frame Religion to the people
as the Popes and Romiſh Clergy did heretofore, making it ſuteable to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of moſt men; or elſe (which is more uſuall) feign a people to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
admitting and accounting whom they lift through partiality, favour,
and ſiniſter reſpects, to be truly religious, though they be not, and ſo receiving
them into the Church as true converts, though they can bring no good teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of their converſion and converſation. This policy (I confeſſe) may
have faire pretences, and would advance them highly above all men; As they
which opening, no man can ſhut; and ſhutting, no man can open; this
would ſet them a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> Gods in the Temple of God, the Church, and bring them
in infinite gaines. But it would ſet up many Antichriſts, as buſie, violent,
and rigorous within the ſmall ſpheare of their activity, as the great Antichriſt
hath been in his: It would turne Religion into policy, making it ſerve for
humane purpoſes.<note place="margin">Iam, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>

                  <hi>The faith of our glorious Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be had
in reſpect of perſons;</hi> It would prove a tyrannicall uſurpation over the true
Church, as the popiſh policy hath done; for which, as for ſundry other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that might be alleadged (if it were not palpably wicked) it ought not
to be ſuffered.</p>
               <p>17. Whether there be any place of Scripture to juſtifie ſuch a Separation
as is afore mentioned? they ſay, yes; becauſe <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt ſaid to the
Scribes and Phariſees, <hi>O generation of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ipers, who hath forewarned you to
fire from the wrath to come?</hi> therefore a Miniſter may keep out of the Church
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:123470:43"/>
ſuch as cannot bring teſtimony of their true converſion and holy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
This and other like reaſons they alleadge, which are ſo inſufficient, that
they need no anſwer, eſpecially having no purpoſe, as I have ſaid, to diſpute
here. But a matter of ſo great conſequence ought to be clearly and foundly
proved; which doubtleſſe they can never doe.</p>
               <p>18. What times they were wherein the Church did thus ſeparate from it
ſelfe all that could not bring ſufficient teſtimony of their converſion and holy
converſation? becauſe they ſay, in former times it was the uſuall practice of
the Church, but ſhew not in what times, nor where, nor for what cauſes.
There is no doubt but thoſe that live or fall into groſſe or manifeſt ſins, may
be ſeparated or excluded; Alſo in times of perſecution they would no doubt
be very wary what ſtrangers they did admit into the Church; but that's
not the thing in queſtion.</p>
               <p>19. Many other doubts in this matter they leave untouched or uncleared;
As 1. Whether Infants ſhall be received into the Church by Baptiſm before
they can bring this teſtimony? 2. Whether thoſe that have been baptized
without ſuch teſtimon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, have been rightly entred into the Church, or ſhall
need to be baptized againe? ſuch a rumour there is ſpread, upon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
I know not. 3. What manner of teſtimony this muſt be? 4. Who muſt
give it, and whether a mans own teſtimony may not ſerve in this caſe, and
when? &amp;c. theſe and many other like ſhould be cleared, which we paſſe over.</p>
               <p>20. Whether they meane, that any man may of himſelfe excommunicate
another, when they ſay frequently, a man may, or I would paſſe a private
excommunication againſt ſuch or ſuch a man?</p>
               <p>21. What they meane to alter in the adminiſtration of the Sacraments?
I heare there is much variety of late. The laſt child which I ſaw baptized,
the Miniſter required the Father to ſay his Creed, which done, the Miniſter
made an expoſition of it, making ſome doubt alſo of ſome part of it, and
then asked the Father if he would have his child baptized into that faith,
who anſwering, yea, it was baptized; and thus I heare he uſeth of late to
baptize others. Now it would be knowne, why it may not ſerve the turne for
the Father to teſtifie his aſſent to the Articles of the Creed &amp;c. as heretofore
hath been uſed? 2. Whether the child and parent alſo may not be very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine
of the Faith into which the child was baptized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing the Miniſters
expoſition is not recorded? 3. Whether they have the ſame opinion of the
Creed that they ſeeme to have of the Scriptures, that it may not bee publikely
read or repeated unleſſe it be alſo expounded by a Miniſter, and why? 4. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this tying of the Baptiſm to the Miniſters expoſition, may not ſerve as a
fit opportunity for Hereticks (not yet diſcovered) to baptize children into
their Hereſie?</p>
               <p>22. Whether the Scriptures be not the word of God, <hi>able to make a man

no Miniſters) alledge in any caſe, be not alſo the word of God, as true and of
as much ſorce as if they were pronounced by a Miniſter?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:123470:43"/>
23. Whether the writings of Eminent and approved Divines may not be
read in the Church, when there is no Sermon? Nay whether they may not
prove more profitable then the Sermons of ſome ſchiſmaticall or other unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Miniſters?</p>
               <p>24 Whether our <hi>Engliſh Common Prayer</hi> (having never yet been called in)
may not be read in the Church, ſuch things being altered or left out as have
bin doubtfull or offenſive to good Chriſtians? Or whether it is ſo faulty that
it may not bee uſed at all? Becauſe they will not ſuffer it to bee read at all
where they preach; and as I heare, intend to aboliſh the reading of it quite.</p>
               <p>25 Whether they will permit any other book of <hi>Common Prayer</hi> uſed in
any other Reformed Church, or ſome other that may be framed, or that no ſet
form at all may be uſed but ſuch prayers only as the Miniſter doth then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,

doth then expound?</p>
               <p>26 How long it is they mean when they ſay <hi>a few dayes,</hi> that they would
have men that would be converted or receive a further degree of grace to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
themſelves in humiliation, before they ſhall partake of thoſe enlightnings
and comforts they ſpeak of? and after what manner this is to be done, and from
what ground of Scripture?</p>
               <p>27 What Covenant it is which they perſwade ſo much all the members of
this Church to enter into at their admittance (and which as is thought is alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
begunne) whereby they muſt bee bound one to another? and how farre

               <p>30 Whether it bee not injurious to the <hi>Honourable Aſſembly of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
to pretend ſuch Innovations or changes to be according to their minde,
which they have never authorized, nor declared themſelves to have any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe

               <p>Many other doubts I have omitted, but by theſe which I have noted, is
may ſufficiently appeare, that though they have long preached of theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,

yet many things remaine very uncertaine. And if they would take the
paines to ſet downe in writing, as aforeſaid, all parts of their intended Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
and Government, it would be very profitable to themſelves; for it
would give them occaſion more throughly to conſider it, and more wiſely to
order it. Is there cauſe then that they ſhould bee ſo incenſed againſt thoſe
that make queſtion of theſe things in a moderate and Chriſtian way? or
whom they feare will oppoſe any of them, as to threaten them with the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of this life, and of the life to come; yea, to aſſigne them the loweſt
places in hell, as if themſelves were well acquainted, and had ſuch power in
diſpoſing places there, as the Pope pretends to have in purgatory? Surely
we learne in our firſt entrance into learning, <hi>Qui dubitat, qui ſaepe rogat, mea
dicta tenebit; Is qui nil dubitat, nil capit inde boni.</hi> Is it juſt or reaſonable
they ſhould accuſe, cenſure, and defame ſuch an one publikely in the Pulpit,
where the party accuſed cannot, without offending the Congregation, and
the Lawes, anſwer for himſelfe, though he be innocent? Surely in all equity
the accuſation, eſpecially of one that is innocent, ought not to be more publike
then his defence or anſwer is permitted to be. Is it ſuteable to Chriſtian cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to uſe heavy imprecations or curſings againſt ſuch, and when the hand of
God is upon ſuch a man in any affliction, as ſickneſſe loſſes, death, or the like;

                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5. 1.</note> and not be drawne from the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
which we know, to joyne our ſelves with any new ſeparate and Independent
Church which we know not; although we heare many contumelious and
reproachfull ſpeeches uttered againſt the Church of <hi>England.</hi> They ought
to be better affected, and to give that honour which is due, as they
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:123470:44"/>
which have ſucked her breaſts, and received as their naturall, ſo their ſpirituall
birth there, if ever they were new born.</p>
               <p>We ought to acknowledge, with thankſgiving the aboundant grace and
mercy of God towards the Church of <hi>England;</hi> who hath made it no leſſe
honourable then any other Reformed Church whatſoever, whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the firſt Reformers, being men of fingular Piety, and bleſſed Martyrs of
Chriſt; Or the purity of Doctrine there publikely profeſſed even to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
Or the number of holy Martyrs, who have adviſedly ſealed that Doctrine
with their blood: Or the eminent lights in the Miniſtry ſucceſſively ſhining there
in great number: Or the many and ſincere Profeſſors and Practiſers of Religon
there, ever ſince the Reformation; Or laſtly, if we conſider the many great
Deliverances which the Lord hath vouchſafed us, from the wicked plots and
hoſtile attempts of the common adverſary, crowning all with much proſperity,
and cauſing the fame and glory of it to be ſpread throughout the world.
Theſe and the like have not been ſeene in their ſeparate and Independent
Churches. In the meane time, we deny not, but that beſides our many other
grievous ſinnes, there have beene alſo many groſſe faults and intollerable in
the Eccleſiaſticall Policy and Diſcipline, as it was abuſed by thoſe that were
intruſted with it, and many foule effects have thence proceeded, which have
(eſpecially of late yeares) corrupted Religion, eclipſed our glory, and laid it
in the duſt, cauſed the Lord to hide his gracious and loving countenance from
us: And was like to have proved the remedileſſe ruine of Church and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Wealth:
Of which ſinnes though wee all ſtand guilty before God, as
having been Authors or Procurers of them; yet it becomes not any, that is, or
lately was a member of that Church, to upbraid her with theſe things in a
deſpightfull manner:<note place="margin">Gal. 4. 17.</note> Such men according to that ſaying of the Apoſtle,
<hi>Are jealous over us amiſſe, yea, they would</hi> (alienate our affections, and) <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
us</hi> (from the Church of <hi>England) that we ſhould altogether love them.</hi>
But theſe corruptions as they have beene for the moſt part forced upon the
Church, by the uſurped power of thoſe which were intruſted, and pretended
the greateſt care of the Church; ſo they have been, and wee truſt will bee
caſt out and Reformed by the preſent Parliament.</p>
               <p>Now I would not be miſtaken, as if I deſired to derogate any thing from
the dignity of that moſt eminent calling of the Miniſtry; I have no ſuch
meaning, neither doe I think a worthy Miniſter to be unworthy or unfit
for other the moſt eminent Offices or callings in Church or Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,
were it not that he hath a moſt eminent calling already ſufficient
to take up the whole man, and unmeet to be yoaked with other callings, as
the Apoſtle ſaith,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 2. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>who is ſufficient for theſe things;</hi> And the Apoſtles doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
ſuch employments with a kinde of contempt ſaying,<note place="margin">Act. 6. 24</note> 
                  <hi>It is not meat that
we ſhould leave the word of God to ſerve Tables,</hi> and a little after, <hi>we will give
our ſelves continually to prayer, and to the Miniſtry of the Word,</hi> intimating
that theſe things would hinder them from prayer and the miniſtry of the
Word; whereby it appeares, they would not be Deacons, nor take upon
them any other Office in or over the Church, but ſpend themſelves wholly
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:123470:45"/>
in the word and prayer; the like might be manifeſted by ſundry other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
And the evill of it hath beene ſo generally obſerved in <hi>England,</hi> that
(as I heard) <hi>Queene Elizabeth,</hi> when ſhe had conferred upon a Miniſter
authority and power to rule, was wont to ſay, <hi>I have ſpoyled a good Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
to day.</hi> And ſurely (if we obſerve it) the deſire of Superiority and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
in or over the Church, in Miniſters and Clergy men, and the readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of Princes and people to conferre it upon them; hath been a principall,
if not the principall cauſe in corrupting Religion from time to time, and of
ſetting up the great Antichriſt, and many others, as might eaſily be ſhewed if
it were not an argument too long for this place.</p>
               <p>Thus farre (through the gracious aſſiſtance of God) I have expreſſed my
minde in this matter, to the intent I might ſtop, ſo much as in me lies, the
ſetting up of a new Diſcipline and Government of our owne framing, ſeeing
we are already freed of all thoſe things that have uſually beene burthenſome
and offenſive to good Chriſtians in <hi>England;</hi> and that we expect daily the
further determination and decree of the Honourable <hi>Aſſembly of Parliament</hi>
in theſe things, Or if I cannot prevaile ſo farre as to ſtop it, yet that wee
might look before we leap, and underſtand well what we doe before we doe
it. Or if neither that may be obtained, yet hence it will appeare, that my ſelfe
and ſome others deſerve no blame, much leſſe ſuch evill ſpeeches as are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
vented againſt us by ſome, becauſe we will not raſhly runne with them
we know not whether. And laſtly, I deſire that this may be a publike teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of my judgement in theſe things. For to be preſent, and heare them
daily preſſed, and to bee alwayes ſilent, is taken for a ſigne of conſent and
approbation.</p>

            <p>SInce this Advertiſement of mine came abroad (though but a month,)
what horrible foreſpeakings, threatnings, imprecations, and cenſures have
beene publikely denounced againſt me in ſeverall parts of the Countrey, I ſhall
not need to repeat, being too well knowne. Neither will I anſwer them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
leſt I alſo be like them; I will only in the feare of God, and by
the comfortable aſſiſtance of his holy Spirit apply that ſaying,<note place="margin">Numb. 23. 1.</note> 
               <hi>How ſhould
they curſe where God hath not curſed? Or how ſhould they deteſt where the
Lord hath not deteſted?</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 16. 12.</note> And thoſe words of <hi>David, It may be that the Lord
will look on mine affliction, and doe me good for his curſing this day.</hi> A deſperate
thing it is for men to blaſpheme againſt ſome good light; and what is it, to
acknowledge the good gifts and graces of God in thoſe which they ſo bitterly
preach againſt; and to overwhelm them all with moſt foule and feigned ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicions
and aſperſions without cauſe? As when they ſay, Satan will not uſe
profane and wicked men, but he makes choiſe of thoſe that are of good and
able parts, men of a religious life, of a blameleſſe converſation; theſe cloſe hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:123470:45"/>
he makes his inſtruments to oppoſe the Kingdom of Chriſt (that is
their intended Diſcipline) &amp;c. with other like ſpeeches. I ſay it is very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
for men thus to give way to wrath and malice. The Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſces
did ſee, and would no doubt have acknowledged the eminent gifts and
graces that ſhined in our Saviour, if he would have applied them to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
of their Faction. But becauſe he would not doe ſo, they maliciouſly
traduced him, and ſaid he had an uncleane ſpirit; but he reproves their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
wickedneſſe, ſhewing how nearly they did approach, or became guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of the ſinne againſt the Holy Ghoſt. And let every man take heed how
they doe cunningly faſten ſlanders, or otherwiſe ſhew deſpight unto the ſpirit
of Grace, becauſe it will not be ſubordinate unto their ends. I could wiſh
alſo they would conſider the words of <hi>Marſilius Patavinus,</hi> in his Book
entituled, <hi>Defender of the Peace,</hi> Where ſpeaking of thoſe that preſume to
frame or preſſe <hi>Orders, Decrees,</hi> and other parts of Diſcipline, without licenſe
of the true Law-giver or Prince, and endeavour to draw people to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of them by ſurreptitious words, as it were compelling them by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
eternall damnation to ſuch as tranſgreſſe them, or denouncing execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
reproachfull ſpeeches, excommunications, ſlanders, revilings, or other
maledictions againſt them, or any of them, in word or writing; ſuch (ſaith
he) are to ſuffer corporall puniſhment in a moſt high degree, as conſpirators,
and ſtirrers up of civill ſchiſme, or diviſion in a Common-wealth. For it is
ſaith he, a moſt grievous kinde of treaſon, becauſe it is committed directly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Royall Majeſty of the Prince and his Soveraigne Authority; and
tendeth to ſet up a plurality of ſupreame authorities or powers, and ſo of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
to the diſſolution or overthrow of every civill Government.</p>
            <p>They object alſo, that I am but a Lay-man, and therefore ſhould not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle
with matters of Divinity, applying that Proverb <hi>Ne ſutor ultra crepidam,</hi>
and ſaying, that even the Sunne, Moone, and Starres, wherein he hath skill,
ſhould teach him that leſſon, which alwayes move in their owne ſpheares, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
they be wandring ſtarres, for whom the blackneſſe of darkneſſe is reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
for ever, with many other bitter expreſſions. But this is an old plea of
the Popiſh Clergy, to hold the people in ignorance and thraldome, and ſhould
not be taken up by thoſe that would ſeeme to be more oppoſite to Popery then
Proteſtants are. That eminent and bleſſed Divine Doctor <hi>Sibbes</hi> was of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
minde, who ſpeaking in commendation of Mr <hi>Sherland</hi> (that was no
Preacher) diſdaines not to ſay he had good skill in controverted points of
Divinity, and that he was a good Divine. And ſurely the calling of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
is of that importance, that he muſt, if need ſo require, omit whatſoever
calling he have beſides, to make good that one moſt neceſſary, neither can he
juſtly be charged to move out of his ſpheare whenſoever he meddles with mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Chriſtianity and Religion, eſpecially ſuch points as he is preſſed to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
and ſubmit unto. The Apoſtle exhorts us all, that <hi>wee ſhould earneſtly
contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the Saints.</hi> And I may fitly
anſwer them in the words of that renouned Souldier of Chriſt Doctor <hi>Baſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>
who being checked by the Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> in like ſort as I am by
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:123470:46"/>
theſe, that he being a Phyſitian, a Lay-man, ſhould preſume to write of ſome
points in Divinity, anſwers in Latine, to this purpoſe in Engliſh.</p>
            <p>I writ a Book (ſaith he) not to finde my ſelfe employment or to ſtirre up
ſtrife, but of a Chriſtian minde and affection, according to my duty to God
and my Prince. The reproach of a Lay-man toucheth not me, for he which
hath vowed himſelfe to Chriſt is one of Gods Clergy. The ancient Church
doth not acknowledge that ſurname of a Lay-man, but reckons it among the
<hi>Soloeciſmes</hi> of the Beaſt. We have given, promiſed, and vowed unto Chriſt
in Baptiſme our name and faith; and have ſolemnly denounced battell
againſt the fleſh, the world, the devill, herefie &amp;c. againſt which wee muſt
fight unleſſe wee put off the reverence and reſpect of our Vow. How unſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable
is it then to ask by what authority we fight againſt theſe? (And a
little after) ſhall that be a fault in me, which is a praiſe to Divines? They
exerciſe phyſick, Grazing, merchantdize, they husband their grounds, plant,
gather in their fruits, they all may doe all things, I envy not; yet I wonder
we ſhould be ſo ſtreightned, whilſt they have ſuch liberty. But if ſome blunt
fellow ſhould ask a Divine, Hear'ſt thou good man, what haſt thou to doe
with the Court, with privy Councell, with Seats of Judgement? what haſt
thou to doe with renting lands, with planting vineyards, with breeding cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
with money the provocation of all evills? would he not check ſuch a
bold queſtion with ſome ſharp anſwer? yes doubtleſſe he would. What
then ſhould we doe when we are asked, What wee have to doe with God,
with Chriſt, with Religion, with the Truth? We will laugh to ſcorne ſuch
envious queſtions, and performe with diligence what God calls us to. Wee
will endeavour with all chearfulneſſe the defence of the truth, the conſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the obſervation of our fidelity and allegiance to that Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne
Authority which is over us; rendring an account of our endeavours
to him, to whom wee have vowed our ſelves &amp;c. He that deſires to ſee his
defence more at large, may peruſe his <hi>Apology to the Engliſh Prelates.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I beſeeth you brethren, mark them diligently which cauſe diviſion and
