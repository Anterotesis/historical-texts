            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>HIs Catholique Majeſtie had given co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement that preſently upon the return of Seigneur Gondomar his Leiger Embaſſador from England, (1618) a ſpeciall meting of all the principal States of Spaine (who were of his Counſel) togither with the Preſidents of the Counſel of Caſtile, of Arragon, of Italy, of Portugall, of the Indies, of the Treaſure, of Warre, and eſpecially of the holy Inquiſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſhould be held at Mouſon in Arragon, the Duke of Lerma being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Preſident, Who ſhould make declaration of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties pleaſure, take account of the Embaſſadors ſervice, and conſult touching the ſtate and religion reſpectively, to giue ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſfaction to his holynes Nuntio, who was diſired to make one in this aſſembly concerning certaine overtures of peace and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie with the Engliſh and other Catholike proiects, which might ingender ſuſpition and jealouſie betwixt the Pope &amp; his Maieſtie, if the miſtery were not unfolded and the grond of thoſe counſels diſcovered aforehand.</p>
            <p>This made all men expect the Embaſſadours returne with a kinde of longing, that they might behold the yſſue of this mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and ſee what good for the Catholike cauſe the Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors imployment had effected in England, anſwerable to the generall opinion conceived of his wiſdome, and what further proiect would be ſet on foot to become matter for publike diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe.</p>
            <p>At length he arrived and had preſent notice given him from his Majeſtie, that before he came to Court he ſhould give up his account to this aſſemblie. Which command he gladly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as an earneſt of his acceptable ſervice, and gave thanks that for his honour he might publiſh himſelf in ſo judicious a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
            <p>He came firſt upon the day appointed to the Counſell cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber (exc. the Secr.) not long after all the Counſell of ſtate and the preſidents met, there wanted onely the Duke of Lerma &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:24674:3"/>
the Popes Nuntio who were the head and feet of all the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Theſe twoo ſtayed long away for divers reſpects, The Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio that he might expreſſe the greatnes of his maſter, &amp; looſe the ſea of Rome no reſpect by his overſight, but that the ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches might be full to obſerve him at his approach.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Lerma to expreſſe the authoritie &amp; dignitie of his owne perſon, and to ſhew houw a ſervant put in place of his maſter, exacts more ſervice of his fellow ſervants then the maſter himſelfe. Theſe two ſtayed til all the reſt were weary of wayting, but at length the Nuntio (ſuppoſing all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel ſet) launched forth and came to roade in the Counſel cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, where (after mutuall diſcharge of duetie from the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and bleſſing upon it from him) he ſate downe in ſolemne ſilence, grieving at his overſight when he ſaw the Duke of Ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma abſent, with whom he ſtrove as a competitor for Pompe and Glorie.</p>
            <p>The Duke had ſent before, &amp; underſtood of the Nuntios being there, and ſtayed ſomething the longer that his boldnes might be obſerved, wherein he had his deſire, for the Nuntio having a while patiently driven away the time with ſeverall compleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts to ſeverall perſons, had now almoſt run his court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip out of breath, but that the Duke of Villa Hermoſa (preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of the counſel of Arragon) fed his humor by the diſcharge of his owne diſcontentment, upon occaſion of the Duke of Lerma his abſence, and beckned Seigneur Gondomor to him, uſing this ſpeech in the hearing of the Nuntio after a ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting manner:</p>
            <p>How unhappie are the people where you have been, firſt for their ſoules, being heretiques; then for their eſtates, where the name of a favourite is ſo familiar? how happie is our ſtate, where the keyes of life and death are ſo eaſely come by, (poyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting at the Nuntio) hanging at every religious girdle, and wher the doore of juſtice and mercie ſtand equally open to all men without reſpect of perſons? the Embaſſador knew this Ironi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call ſtroke, to be intented as a by blow at the Nuntio, but fully at the Duke of Lerma (whoſe greatnes bega<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> now to wax heavy, towards declenſion) and therfore he returned this anſwer: your excellencie knoweth the ſtate is happie where wiſe favorites
<pb facs="tcp:24674:3"/>
governe Kings if the Kings themſelves be fooliſh, or where wiſe Kings are, who having favorites whether fooliſh or of the wijſer ſort will not yet be governed by them. The ſtate of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, (howſoever you heare of it in Spayne or Roome) is too happie in the laſt kinde: They need not much care what the favorite be (though for the moſt part he be ſuch as prevents all ſuſpition in that kinde, being rather choſen as a ſcholler to be taught and trayned up, then as a tutor to teach,) of this they are ſure, no Prince exceeds theirs in perſonall abilities; ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could be added to him in my wiſh, but this one, that he were our vaſſayle and a Catholique.</p>
            <p>With that the noyſe without gave notice of the Duke of Ler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas entrance, at whoſe firſt approch the whole houſe aroſe, though ſome later then other, as envie had hung plummets on them to keep them downe, the Nuntio onely ſate unmooved, the Duke cheriſhed the obſervance of the reſt with a familiar kind of carriage too high for courteſie, as one not neglecting their demeanors but expecting it, and after a filiall obeyſance to the Pope his Nuntio, ſate down, as preſident vnder the cloath of ſtate, but ſomewhat lower; then after a ſpace given for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, preparation, and attention, he began to ſpeake in this manner.</p>
            <p>The King my maſter (holding it more honourable to doe then to diſcourſe, to take from you the expectation of Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie uſed rather in ſchooles and pulpits then in Councels) hath appointed me preſident in this holy, wiſe, learned, and noble aſſembly; A man naturally of a ſlow ſpeach, and not deſirous to quicken it by art or induſtrie, as holding action onely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to a ſpaniard as I am by birth, to a ſouldier as I am by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſiion, to a King as I am by repreſentation; take this therefore briefly for declaration both of the cauſe of this meeting and my maſter his further pleaſure.</p>
            <p>There hath bene in al times fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the worlds fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>datio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one chiefe commander or Monarch upon the earth. This needs no further profe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a bak loking into our own memories &amp; hiſtories of the world, neither now is there any queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> (except with infidels &amp; heritiques) of that one chief Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mander in ſpirituals in the unity
<pb facs="tcp:24674:4"/>
of whoſe perſon the membres of the viſible Church are inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but there is ſome doubt of the chief co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mander in tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralls, who (as the moon to the ſun) might govern by night as this by day, &amp; by the ſword of iuſtice compell to come in, or cutt off ſuch as infringe the authoritie of the keyes. This hath been ſo well underſtood long ſince, by the infallible chaire, as that thereby upon declenſion of the Romane Emperours, and the increaſe of Romes ſpirituall ſplendor (who thought it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall that their ſun ſhould be ſublunary) our nation was by the Biſhop of Rome ſelected before other peoples to conquer and rule the nations with a rod of Iron, and our Kings to that end adorned with the title of Catholike King, as a name above all names under the ſunne (which is) under Gods Vicar generall himſelf the Catholike Biſhop of ſoules. To inſtance this point by compariſon, looke firſt upon the grand Seigneur the great Turk who hath a large title but not univerſall. For beſides that he is an infidel, his command is confined within his owne territories, and he ſtyled not Emperour of the world but of the Turks and their vaſſals onely.</p>
            <p>Among Chriſtians the defender of the faith was a glorious ſtile, whilſt the King to whom it was given by his holynes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued worthy of it. But he ſtood not in the trueth, neither yet thoſe that ſucceed him. And beſide it was no great thing to be called what every Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought to be, defender of the faith, no more then to be ſtiled with France, the moſt Chriſtian King, wherein he hath the greateſt part of his title commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> with moſt Chriſtians. The Emperour of Ruſſia, Rome, Germany, extend not their limits further then their ſtiles, which are locall, onely my maſter the moſt Catholike King is for dominion of bodies, as the univerſall Biſhop for dominio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of ſoules ouer all that part of the world which we call America (except where the Engliſh intruders uſurp) and the greateſt part of Europe with ſome part of Aſia and Africa by actual poſſeſſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; over al the reſt by real &amp; indubitable right, yet acknowledgeth this right to be derived fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the free and fatherly donation of his holynes, who as the ſun to this moone lends luſter by reflection to this Kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, to this King, to this King of Kings my maſter, what therefore he hath, howſoever gotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, he may keep and hold. What he can get from
<pb facs="tcp:24674:4"/>
any other King or Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mander by any ſtratageme of war or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of peace he may take, for it is theirs onely by uſurpation except they hold of him from whom all civill power is derived, as eccleſiaſticall from his holynes. What the ignorant call trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, if it be on this behalf is truth; and what they call truth, if it be againſt him is treaſon: &amp; thus all our peace, our warre, our trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes, mariages and whatſoever intendement els of ours, aimes at this principall end, to get the whole poſſeſſion of the world, &amp; to reduce all to unitie under one temporall head, that our King may truely be what he is ſtiled, the catholicke &amp; univerſal King. As faith is therfore univerſal &amp; the Church univerſall, yet ſo as it is under one head the Pope, whoſe ſeate is &amp; muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be at Rome where S. Peter ſate: ſo muſt all men be ſubject to our and their Catholique King, whoſe particular ſeat is here in Spayne, his univerſall euery where; this point of State or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of faith, we ſee the Romane Catholike religion hath taught every where, and almoſt made naturall, ſo that by a key of gold by intelligence, or by way of confeſſion my maſter is able to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock the ſecrets of every Prince, and to withdraw their ſubjects allegiance, as if they knewe themſelves rather my maſter his ſubjects in truth, then theirs whom their birthes have taught to miſcall Soveraigns. We ſee this in France and in England eſpecially where at once they learne to obey the Church of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me as their mother, to acknowledge the catholique King as their father, and to hate their owne King as an heretique and an uſurper. So we ſee religion and the ſtate are coupled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, laugh and weep, flouriſh &amp; fade, and participate of eit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hers fortune, as growing upon one ſtock of policy; I ſpeake this the more boldly in this preſence, becauſe I ſpeake here before none but native perſons, who are partakers both in themſelves and iſſues of theſe triumphs aboue all thoſe of ancient Rome, &amp; therefore ſuch (as beſides their oathes) it concernes to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. Neyther need we reſtrain this freedome of ſpeach from the Nuntio his preſence, becauſe that beſides that he is a Spaniard by birth, he is alſo a Ieſuite by profeſſion, an order raiſed by the providence of Gods Vicar to accompliſh this monarchy the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, all of them being appropriate thereunto, and as publike agents and privie Counſellers to this end, Wherein the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome

of this ſtate is to be beheld with admiration, that as in temporal warre it employes or at leaſt truſts none but natives, in Caſtile, Portugall or Arragon; ſo in ſpirituals it imployes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne but the Ieſuites, and ſo imployes them, that they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reputed, how remote ſoever they be from us, how much ſoever obliged to others, ſtill to be ours, and ſtill to be of the Spaniſh faction, though they be Polonians, Engliſh, French, &amp; reſiding in thoſe countries &amp; Courts; the Penitents therfore and all with whom they deale and converſe in their ſpirituall traf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fique muſt needs be ſo too, and ſo our Catholique King muſt needs have an inviſible kingdome, &amp; an unknowne number of ſubjects in all dominions, who will ſhew themſelves and their faiths by their works of diſobedience whenſoever we ſhal have occaſion to uſe that Ieſuiticall vertue of theirs. This therefore being the principal ends of all our counſels (according to thoſe holy directions of our late pious King Philip 2. to his ſonne now reviving) to advance the Catholike Romane religion, and the Catholike ſpaniſh dominion together, we are met now by his Majeſties command to take account of you (Seigneur Gondomor) who haue been Embaſſadour for England, to ſee what good you haue effected there towards the advancement of this worke, &amp; what further project ſhall be thought fit to be ſet on foot to this end. And this is briefly the occaſion of our meeting.</p>
            <p>Then the Embaſſ. (who attended bare headed all the time) with a low obeiſance began thus. This moſt laudable cuſtome of our Kings in bringing all officers to ſuch an account where a review and notice is taken of good or bad ſervices upon the determination of their imployments, reſembles thoſe Romane triumphs appointed for the ſoldiers; and as in them it provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to courage, ſo in us it ſtirres vp to diligence. Our maſter converſeth by his Agents with all the world, yet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of more regard then the Engliſh, where matter of ſuch di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſitie is often preſented (through the ſeverall humors of the State, and thoſe of our religion and faction) that no inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons can be ſufficient for ſuch negotiations, but much muſt be left in truſt, to the diſcretion, judgment and diligence of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent, I ſpeake not this for my owne glory, I having bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrayned

               </gap> the behalf of others, that ther may be more ſcope alovved the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to deal in as occaſion ſhall require. Briefly this rule delivered by his excellency was the card and Compas by which I ſayled to make profit of al humors, and by all meanes to advance the ſtate of the Romiſh faith, and the Spaniſh faction togither, upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> all advantage eyther of oathes, or the breach of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; for this is an old obſervation but a true, that for our pietie to Rome, his holynes did not onely give, but bleſſe us in the conqueſt of the new world, And thus in our pious perſeverance we hope ſtil to be conquerours of the old. And to this end wheras his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentie in his excellent diſcourſe, ſeemes to extend our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward forces &amp; private aimes onely againſt heretiques and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine them in true amitie with theſe of the Romiſh religion: This I affirme, that ſince there ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be no ſecurity, but ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces though now Romiſh Catholiques, may turne heretiques hereafter; my aimes haue ever been to make profit of all, &amp; to make my maſter, maſter of al, who is a faithful &amp; conſtant ſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne of his mother Rome. And to this end I behold the ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of our Kings of happy memorie, hovv they haue achie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved kingdomes and conqueſts by this policy, rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hoſtility, and that without difference, as wel from their allies and kinsfolks, men of the ſame religion, and profeſſion, ſuch as were thoſe of Naples, France and Navar, though I doe not me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Poitugall now united to us, nor Savoy (that hardly ſlipt fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> us) as of an adverſe and heretical faith. Neyther is this rule left of, as the preſent kingdome of France, the State of Venice, the Low-countries, Bohemia, (now al labouring for life under our plots) apparantly manifeſt. This way therfore I bent my engins in England, as your honours ſhal particularly heare. Neyther ſhal I need to repeat a Catalogue of all the ſervices I haue there done, becauſe this ſtate hath been acquainted with many of them here to fore by the intercourſe of letters and meſſengers. Thoſe onely I will ſpeak of that are of later edition, done ſince the returne of the Lord Roſſe fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hence, and may ſeeme moſt directly to te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to thoſe ends formerly propounded by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellentie; that is, the advancement of the Spaniſh State and Romiſh Religion togither.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:24674:6"/>Firſt it is well obſerved by the wiſdome of our State, that, the King of England, who otherwiſe is one of the moſt acco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pliſht Princes that ever raign'd, extreamly hunts after peace, and ſo affects the true name of a Peacemaker, as that for it he wil doe or ſuffer any thing. And withall they have beheld the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bountie &amp; munificence of his minde, and the neceſſity of the ſtate ſo exhauſted, as it is unable to ſupply his deſires, who onely ſeeks to haue that he might giue to others. Vpon thoſe advantages they have given out their directions and inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons both to me and others, and I haue obſerved the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo farre as I was able.</p>
            <p>And for this purpoſe, wheras there was a marriage propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded betwixt them and us, (howſoever I ſuppoſe our State too devout to deale with heretiques in this kinde in good earneſt, yet) I made that a cover for much intelligence, and a meanes to obtaine whatſoever I deſired, whileſt the State of England lon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ged after that mariage, hopeing thereby (though vainely) to ſettle peace, and fill the Excheaquer.</p>

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Inquiſitor generall ſtept up and interrupted Gondamor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaying, that maryage was not to be thought vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; firſt for religions ſake, leſt they ſhould indan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger the ſoule of the younge Lady and the reſt of her company, who might become her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To the firſt objection the Popes Nuntio anſwered, that his holynes for the Catholique cauſe would diſpenſe with the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, though it were with a Turke or infidel. 1. That there was no valuable danger in hazarding one for the gaining of many, perhaps of all. 2. That it was no hazard<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſince women (eſpetial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly yong ones) are to obſtinate to be removed from their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and abler to worke Solomon to their opinions, then Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to work them to his faith. 3. That it was a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to match wich ſuch from whom they might break at plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, having the catholique cauſe for a colour, and beſides, if need were to be at liberty in all reſpects ſince there was no faith to be kept with heretiques. And if his Holynes may diſpe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce
<pb facs="tcp:24674:6"/>
with the murther of ſuch, &amp; diſpoſe of their crownes (as what good Catholique doubts but he may?) much more may he, and wil he in their mariages to prevent the leprous ſeed of hereſie, and to ſettle Catholique blood in the chaire of State.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond objection the Ambaſſadour himſelfe anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, ſaying, that though the Engliſh generally loathed the matche, and would as he thought buy it off with halfe of their eſtates, (hating the nation of Spain, and their religion, as appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ared by an uproare and aſſault a day or two before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from London by the Apprentices, who ſeemed greedy of ſuch an occaſion to vent their owne ſpleenes, in doing him or any of his a miſchiefe) yet two ſorts of people unmeaſurably deſired the match might proceed. Firſt the begging and beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly Courtyers, that they might haue to furniſh their wants. Secondly the Romiſh Catholiques, who hoped hereby at leaſt for a moderation of fynes and lawes, perhaps a tolleraaion, and perhaps a total reſtauration of their religion in England. In which regard (quoth he) I haue knowne ſome zealous perſons proteſt, that if al their friendes and halfe their eſtates could pro<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cure the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the ſervice of our Lady (if ſhe came to be maried too their Prince) they would freely uſe the meanes: faithfully to fight under her colours, when they might doe it ſafely. And if it came to portion, they would underhand contribute largely of their eſtates to the Spaniſh Collector, and make up halfe the portion out of themſelves, perhaps more. So that by this mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age it might be ſo wrought, that the ſtate ſhould rather be robd and weakened (which is our ayme) then ſtrengthened, as the Engliſh vainely hope. Beſides in a ſmall tyme they ſhould worke ſo far into the body of the State, by buying Offices and the like, whether by ſea or land, of Iuſtice civil or eccleſiaſtical, in Church or State (all being for money expoſed to ſale) that with the helpe of the Ieſuites, they would undermine them with meere wit (without gunpowder) and leave the King but a fewe ſubjects whoſe faithes hee might rely upon, whilſt they were of a faith adverſe to his. For what catholique body that is ſound at the hart, can abide a corrupt and heretical head?</p>
            <p>With that the <hi>Duke, Medina del rio Secco,</hi> preſident of the
<pb facs="tcp:24674:7"/>
councel of warr and one of the councel of State roſe up and ſayd his Predeceſſors had felt the force and wit of the Engliſh in 88. And he had cauſe to doubt the Catholiques themſelves that were Engliſh and not fully Ieſuited, upon any forreigne invaſion would rather take part with their owne King (though a heretique) then with his Catholique Majeſtie a ſtranger.</p>
            <p>The Ambaſſadour deſired him to be of another minde ſince firſt for the perſons generally their bodies by long diſuſe of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes vvere diſabled and their mindes effeminated by peace and luxury, far from that they were in 88. when they were dayly fleſht in our blood and made hearty by cuſtomary conqueſts. And for the affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of thoſe whom they call Recuſants (quoth hee) I know the bitternes of their inveterate malice, &amp; haue ſee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſo farr into their natures as I dare ſay they will be for Spaine againſt all the world. Yet (quoth hee) I aſſure your Honours I could not imagine ſo baſely of their King and State as I haue heard them ſpeake. Nay their rage hath ſo perverted their judgements that what I my ſelf haue ſeen and heard proceed from their King beyond admiration, even to aſtoniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, they haue ſlighted, miſreported, ſcorned, and perverted to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace and my reioycing, magnifying in the meane time our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, for graces.</p>
            <p>Here the <hi>Duke Paſtrana</hi> preſident of the Councell for Italy, ſteps up and ſayd, he had lately read a booke of one Camdens called his Annalles, where writing of a treaty of mariage long ſince betwixt the Engliſh <hi>Elizabeth</hi> &amp; the french Duke of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diou,</hi> he there obſerves that the mariage vvas not ſeriouſly inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on eyther ſide, but politickly pretended by both States, counterchangeably, that each might effect their owne ends.</p>
            <p>There (quoth he) the Engliſch had the better, and I haue ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me cauſe to doubt, ſince they can diſſemble as vvel as wee, that they haue their aymes underhand, as we haue, and intend the match as little as we doe; And this (quoth he) I beleeue the rather becauſe their King as he is wiſe to conſult and conſider, ſo he is a conſtant maſter of his word, and hath written and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ſtrong reaſons againſt matches made vvith perſons of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary religions, which reaſons no other man can anſwere, and therefore doubtleſſe he wil not go from or conncell his ſonne
<pb facs="tcp:24674:7"/>
to forſake thoſe rules layd down ſo deliberately.</p>
            <p>Your Excellency miſtakes (quoth the Ambaſſadour) the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage was the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> one the ſide of the Engliſch, becauſe the Fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ch ſought the match: now it muſt be on ours, becauſe the Engliſh ſeeck it, who will grant any thing rather the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> breake off, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides haue no patience to temporize and diſſemble in this or any other diſigne as the French haue long ſince wel obſerued: for their neceſſities will giue them neither time, nor reſt, nor hope els where to be ſupplyed. As for their King I cannot ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch into his hart, I muſt beleeve others that preſume to know his minde, heare his words, and read his writings, and theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late vvhat I haue delivered: But for the reſt of the people as the number of thoſe that are truely religious are ever the leaſt and for the moſt part of leaſt accompt, ſo is it there, where if an equall oppoſition be made betwixt their truely religious and ours, the remainder which wilbe the greateſt number will ſtand indifferent and fall to the ſtro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger ſide where there is moſt hope of gaine and glorie, for thoſe two are the gods of the magnitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de &amp; the multitude, Novv theſe ſee apparantly no certain ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyes of their wants but from us.</p>
            <p>Yes (quoth the <hi>Duke</hi>) for even now you ſayd the general ſtate loathing this match vvould redeme the feare there of with half of their eſtates. It is theaefore but calling a Parliament and the buſines were ſoon effected.</p>
            <p>A Parliament (quoth the Ambaſſadour) nay therein lies one of the principal ſervices I haue done in working ſuch a diſlike betwixt the King and the lower houſe by the endeuor of that honourable Earle and admirable Engine (a ſure ſervant to us and the catholike cauſe while he lived) as the King will never indure Parliament againe, but rather ſuffer abſolute want then receive conditionall relief from his ſubjects. Beſides the matter was ſo cunningly caried the laſt Parliament, that as in the powder plot the fact effected ſhould haue been imputed to the Puritans (the greateſt zelots of the Calvinian ſect) ſo the propoſition which damde up the procedings of this Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t howſoeuer they were inve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted by Romane Catholiques and by the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> inte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded to diſturbe that ſeſſion, yet were propounded in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of the Puritans, as if they had bee<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mered in their forge.
<pb facs="tcp:24674:8"/>
Which very name and ſhadovv the King hates, it being a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cien aſpertio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to diſgrace any perſon, to ſay he is ſuch, &amp; a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient barre to ſtop any ſuite &amp; utterly to croſſe it to ſay it ſmels of or inclines to that partie. Mareover there are ſo many about him who blovv this cole fearing their owne ſtakes, if a Parliament ſhould inquire into their actions, that they uſe all their a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t and induſtrie to withſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſuch a councell; perſwading the King he may rule by his abſolute prerogative without a Parliament, and thus furniſh himſelf by warying with us, and by other domeſtick projects, without ſubſidies: when, levying of ſubſidies and taskes have been the onely uſe princes haue made of ſuch aſſemblies. And wheras ſome free mindes amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> reſembling our Nobilitie who preſerve the priviledge of ſub<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>jects againſt ſoveraign invaſion, call for the courſe of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lavve, (a lawe proper to their nation) theſe other tyme ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers cry the lawes down and cry up the prerogative, wherby they prey upon the ſubject by ſuites and exactions, milk the eſtate and keep it poore, procure themſelves much ſuſpition amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt the better &amp; more judicious ſort, &amp; hate amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt th'op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed commons, &amp; yet if there ſhould be a Parliament ſuch a courſe is taken as they ſhal never chooſe their ſheere Knights and Burgeſſes freely, who make the greater half of the body thereof, for theſe being to be elected by moſt voices of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders in the countrey where ſuch elections are to be made, are caried which vvay the great perſons vvho haue lands in thoſe countries pleaſe, who by their letters command their tenants, followers and friends to nominate ſuch as adhere to them, and for the moſt part are of our factio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and reſpect their owne benefit or grace rather then their countries good, yea the countrey people themſelves will every one ſtand for the great man, their Lord or neighbour, or maſter, vvithout regard of his honeſty, wiſdome, or religion. That which they ayme at (as I am aſſured of by faithful intelligence) is to pleaſe their la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lords &amp; to renue their leaſe, in which regard they will betray their Countrey and religion too, &amp; elect any man that may moſt profite their particular. Therefore it is unlikely there ſhould ever be a Parliament, &amp; impoſſible the Kings debts ſhould be payd, his vvants ſufficiently repaired, and himſelfe
<pb facs="tcp:24674:8"/>
left ful handed by ſuch a courſe, &amp; indeed as it is generally thought) by any other courſe but by a mariage with us. For which cauſe whatſoever proiect we liſt to atte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pt, enters ſafely at that dore, vvhilſt their policie lies a ſleepe and will not ſee the danger, I haue made triall of theſe particulars, and found few exceptions in this generall rule.</p>
            <p>There by I and their ovvne wants togither haue kept them from furniſhing their Navy, which being the wal of their Hand, &amp; once the ſtrongeſt in Chriſtendome lies now at roade unar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med &amp; fit for ruine. If ever vve doubted their ſtrength by ſea, now vve need not, there are but few ſhips or men able to looke abroad or to live in a ſtorme, much leſſe in a ſea fight. This I effected by bearing them in hand the furniſhing a Navy bred ſuſpition in my maſter &amp; ſo would avert his mind from this match, the hope of vvhich rather then they would looſe, they would looſe almoſt their hope of heaven.</p>
            <p>Secondly all their voyages to the Eaſt Indies I permit rather vvith a colourable reſiſtance then a ſerious. Becauſe I ſee them not helpful but hurtfull to the ſtate in generall, carying out gould and ſilver bringing home ſpece, ſilks, feathers, and the like toyes, and inſenſible waſting the common ſtock of coyne and bullyon, whilſt it fills the Cuſtome houſe and ſome private purſes. who thereby are inable to keep this diſcommodity on foot by bribes; eſpecially ſo many great perſons (even Stateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men) being venturers and ſharers in the gaine. Beſides this waſteth their Mariners, not one of ten returning. Which I am glad to heare, for they are the men vve ſtand in feare of.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As for their Weſt indian voyages, I withſtand them in earnſt becauſe they begin to inhabit there and to fortifie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and may in tyme there perhaps raiſe an other England to withſtand our new Spaine in America, as this old England oppoſeth our preſent State, and cloudes the glorious extent therof in Europe. Beſides there they trade for commodities vvithout waſt of their treaſure, &amp; often returne go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ld for knives, glaſies, or the like trifles, and that without ſuch loſſe of their Mariners as in other places. Therefore I croſt vvhatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver intendements were projected for Virginea or the Bermu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das; becauſe I ſee they may be hereafter really helpe full unto
<pb facs="tcp:24674:9"/>
them, as novv they ſerve for draines to unloade their populous State, which elſe would overflow its own bancks by continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of peace, and turne head upon it ſelf or make a body fit for any rebellion.</p>
            <p>And ſo farre I prevayled herein, as I cauſed moſt of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſants vvho were ſharers to withdraw their venters &amp; diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the vvork, ſo that beſides private perſons unable to effect much, nothing was done by the publike purſe. And we know by experience ſuch voyages and plantations are not effected without great meanes to ſuſtaine great difficluties, and with an unwearied reſolution and power, to meete al hazards and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters with ſtrong helpes and continuall ſupplies, or elſe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking proues idle.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly. By this meanes likevviſe I kept the voluntary forces from Venice, till it vvas almoſt too late to ſet out. And had a hope that work of ſeacrecy ſhould haue broken forth to action, before theſe could haue arrived to ſuccour them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fiftly, I put hard for the Cautionary tovvnes (which our late King Philip of happy memory ſo aymed at, accounting the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the keyes of the low Countries) that they might be delivered to his Catholike Majeſtie as the proper owner. And had perhaps preuayled, but that the profeſt enemy to our State and Church, vvho dyed ſhortly after, gave counſell to reſtore them to the rebellious States; as one that knew Pouillar Common wealthes to be better neighbours, ſurer friends, and leſſe daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous enemyes, tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Monarchies; and ſo by his practiſe reſcued them from my handes, and furniſhed the Excheaquer from thence for that tyme. Neyther vvas I much greeved at this; becauſe the Dependancy they had before of the Engliſh ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med novv to be cut off, and the intereſt the Engliſh had in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and their cauſe to be taken avvay, vvhich muſt be ſully and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally effected before we can hope eyther to conquer them or England, who holding togither are too ſtrong for the world at ſea, &amp; therefore muſt be diſunited, before they can be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. This point of State is acknowledged by our moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced Petioner and ſure friund <hi>Monſieur Barnevelt,</hi> vvhoſe ſucceeding plots to this end, ſhall beare witnes for the depth of his judgement.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb facs="tcp:24674:9"/>6. But the laſt ſervice I did for the State, was not the leaſt; when I underwrought that admirable Engine <hi>Raleigh,</hi> and ſo was the cauſe his voyage (threatning ſo much daunger and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to us) was overthrowne, and himſelfe returning in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace, I purſued almoſt to death, neither (I hope) need I ſay al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt, if all things hit right, and all ſtrings hold. But the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of my commiſſion, vvould not permit me longer to ſtay to follow him to execution, vvhich I deſired the rather, that by conceſſion I might haue wrung from the inconſiderate Engliſh, an acknowledgement of my maſters right in thoſe places, puniſhing him for attempting there, though they might preſcribe for the firſt foot, And this I did to ſtop theit mouthes hereafter, and becauſe I would quench the heate &amp; valour of that nation, that none ſhould dare hereafter to undertake the like, or be ſo hardy as to looke at our ſea, or breathe upon our Coaſtes. And laſtly becauſe I would bring to an ignominious death, that old <hi>Pyrat,</hi> who is one of the laſt now living, bred under that deceaſed Engliſh <hi>Virago,</hi> and by her fleſht in our blood and ruine. To doe this I had many Agents, firſt divers Courtiers who were hungrie and gaped wide for Spaniſh gould; ſecondly ſome that bare him at the heart for inveterate quarrels; Thirdly ſome forreigners who having in vaine ſought the <hi>Elixer</hi> hitherto, hope to finde it in his head; Fourthly all me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Romiſh faith who are of the Spaniſh faction, and would haue been my bloodhounds, to hunt him or any ſuch to death willingly, as perſons hating the proſperitie of their Country, and the valour, worth, and wit of their owne nation, in reſpect of us and our Catholike cauſe; Laſtly I left behinde mee ſuch an inſtrument compoſed artificially of a ſecular underſtanding and a religious profeſſion as hee is every way adapted to ſerue himſelf into the cloſet of the heart, and to worke upon femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine leuity, who in that county haue maſculine ſpirits to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and purſue their plots unto death. This therefore I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt as done, &amp; rejoyce in it, knowing it vvill be very profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to us, gratefull to our faction there; and for the reſt, what though it be croſſe to the people, or the Clergy? vve that onely negotiate for our owne gaine, and treate about this mariage for our owne ends, can conclude or breake off when we ſee our
<pb facs="tcp:24674:10"/>
time, without reſpect of ſuch as can neither profit us, nor hurt us; for I haue certaine knowledge that the commons generally are ſo effeminate and cowardly, as that they at their muſters (which are ſeldome and ſlight, onely for the benefit of their muſter-maſter) of a thouſand ſouldiers, ſcarce one hundred dare diſcharge a musker, and of that hundred, ſcarce one can uſe it like a ſouldier. And for their armes, they are ſo ill provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that one corſelet ſerveth many men, when ſuch as ſhew their armes upon one day in one place, lend them to their fre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds in other places to ſhew when they haue uſe. And this if it be ſpied, is only puniſhed by a mulct in the purſe, which is the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers aime, who for his advantage winkes at the reſt, and is glad to finde and cheriſh by connivence profitable faults which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his revenue. Thus ſtands the ſtate of that poore miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble country, which had never more people and fewer men. So that if my maſter ſhould reſolve upon an invaſion, the time ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fits as at this preſent, ſecuritie of this mariage and the diſuſe of armes having caſt them into a dead ſleepe, a ſtrong and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening faction being ever amongſt them ready to aſſiſt us, and they being unprovided of ſhippes and armes, or hearts to fight, an univerſall diſcontentment filling all men. This I haue from their muſter-maſters and Captaines, who are many of them of our religion, or of none, and ſo ours, ready to be bought and ſould, and deſirous to be my maſters ſervants in fee.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the ſtate particularly, wherein I haue bent my ſelfe to weaken them and ſtrengthen us, &amp; in all theſe haue advanced the Catholicke cauſe, but eſpecially in procuring fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for all ſuch as favour that ſide, and croſſing the other by all meanes. And this I practiſe my ſelfe &amp; give out to be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally practiſed by others, that whatſoever ſucceſſe I finde, I ſtill boaſt of the victory, which I doe to dishearten the heretiques, to make them ſuſpitious one of an other, eſpecially of their Prince and their beſt Stateſmen, and to keepe our owne in cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, who by this meanes increaſe, otherwiſe would be in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to decay.</p>
            <p>Now for religion, and for ſuch deſignes as fetch their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence from thence, I beheld the policie of that late Biſhop of theirs (<hi>Bancroft</hi>) who ſtird up and maintained a dangerous
<pb facs="tcp:24674:10"/>
ſchiſme, betweene our ſecular Prieſts and Ieſuites, by which he diſcovered much weaknes, to the diſhonour of our clergie, and prejudice of our cauſe. This taught me (as it did <hi>Barnevelt</hi> in the Low countries) to worke ſecretly and inſenſibly betweene their Conformiſts and Non-conformiſts, and to caſt an eye as far as the Orcades; knowing that buſynes might be ſtirred up there, that might hinder proceedings in England, as the French ever uſed Scotland to call home the forces of England, and ſo to prevent their conqueſts. The effect you haue partly ſeene in the Earle of <hi>Argile,</hi> who ſometimes was Captaine for the King and Church againſt the great Marquis <hi>Huntley,</hi> &amp; now fights under our banner at <hi>Bruxels,</hi> leaving the croſſes of S. George &amp; S. Andrewe for the ſtaffe of S. Iames. Neither doe our hopes end here, but we daily expect more revolters, at leaſt ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union as wil never admit ſolid reconcileme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but will ſend ſome to us, and ſome to Amſterdam. For the King (a wiſe and vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Prince) labouring for a perfect union betwixt both the kingdomes, which he ſees cannot be effected, where the leaſt ceremony in religion is continued, divers ſharp and bitter brau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les from thence ariſing, whilſt ſome ſtriving for honour more then for truth, prefer their owne way &amp; wil, before the general peace of the Church &amp; the edification of ſoules) he I ſay ſeekes to worke both Churches to uniformitie, and to this end made a journey into Scotland, but with no ſuch ſucceſſe as he expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for divers of ours attended the traine, who ſtirred up hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and factions, and caſt in ſcruples and doubts to hinder &amp; croſſe the proceedings; yea thoſe that ſeeme moſt adverſe to us and adverſe from our opinions, by their diſobedience and example helpe forward our plots, and theſe are incouraged by a factious and heady multitude, by a faint &amp; irreſolute clergie, (many falſe brethre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt their Bps.) &amp; by the prodigal Nobilitie who maintaine theſe ſtirs in the Church, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may ſafely keepe their Church livings in their hands, which they haue moſt ſacrilegiouſly ſeaſed upon in the time of the firſt deformatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp; which they feare would be recovered by the Clergy if they could be brought to brotherly peace &amp; agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for they haue ſeene the King very bountiful in this kind, hauing lately increaſed their pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s &amp; ſetled the Clergy a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pete<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t
<pb facs="tcp:24674:11"/>
maintenance, &amp; beſides out of his owne meanes vvhich in that kingdome is none of the greateſt, having brought in and reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red whole Biſhopriks to the Church, which were before in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens hands, a great part of the Nobilities eſtates conſiſting of ſpirituall lands, vvhich makes them cheriſh the puritanicall fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who will be content to be trencher-fed with ſcraps and crummes and contributions and arbitrary benevolences from their Lords and Lairds and Ladies, and their adherents and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>
            <p>But (quoth the Inquiſitor generall) how if this act of the Kings, wherein hee is moſt earneſt and conſtant, ſhould ſo far thrive, as it ſhould effect a perfect union both in the Church &amp; Common wealth? I tell you it would in my conceite be a great blowe to us, if by a generall meeting a generall peace ſhould be concluded, and all their forces bent againſt Rome; and we ſee their politick King aimes at this.</p>
            <p>True (quoth <hi>Gondamore</hi>) but he takes his marke amiſſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever hee underſtand the people and their inclination better then any man, and better knowes how to temper their paſſions and affections; for (beſides that he is hindred there in Scotland underhand by ſome for the reaſons before recited, and by other great ones of ours who are in great place &amp; authoritie amongſt them) hee is likewiſe deluded in this point even by his owne Clergie at home in England, who pretend to be moſt forward in the cauſe. For they conſidering if a generall uniformitie were wrought, what an inundation would follow, whilſt all or moſt of theirs (as they feare) would flock thither for preferment (as men preſſing towards the ſunne for light and heare) and ſo their owne ſhould be unprovided; theſe therefore (I ſay) how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they beare the King fairly in hand, are underhand againſt it, and ſtand ſtiffe for all ceremonies to be obtruded with a kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of abſolute neceſſitie upon them, when the other wil not be almoſt drawne to receive any. When if an abatement were made, doubtleſſe they might be drawne to meete in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt; but there is no hope of this with them, where neither party deales ſeriouſly, but onely for the preſent, to ſatisfie the King: and ſo there is no feare on our ſide that affections and opinions ſo divers, will ever be reconciled and made one. Their Biſhop
<pb facs="tcp:24674:11"/>
of <hi>S. Andrevves</hi> ſtands almoſt alone in the cauſe, and puls upon himſelf the labour, the loſſe and the envie of all, with little pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie, whilſt the adverſe faction haue as ſure friends and as good intelligence about the King as he hath, and the ſame Poſt perhaps that brings a packet from the King to him, brings ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from their Abettors to them, acquainting them with the whole proceedings and counſels, &amp; preparing them aforehand for oppoſition: this I know for truth, and this I reioyce in, as conducing much to the Catholick good.</p>
            <p>But (quoth the Nuntio) are there none of the hereticall prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers buſie about this match? Me thinkes their fingers ſhould itch to be writing and their tongues burn to be prating of this buſynes, eſpecially the puritanicall ſort, howſoever the moſt temperate and indifferent cary themſelves.</p>
            <p>The truth is my Lord (quoth the <hi>Ambaſſadour</hi>) that private<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what they can, and publiquely what they dare, both in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land &amp; Scotland all for the moſt part (exc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>pt ſuch as are of our faith) oppoſe this match to their utmoſt, by prayers, counſels, ſpeeches, wiſhes; but if any be found longer tongued then his fellowes, we haue ſtill meanes to charme their ſawcineſſe, to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence them, and expell them the Court, to diſgrace them and croſſe their preferments, with the imputation pragmaticke Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritaniſme. For inſtance I will relate this particular; A Doctor of theirs and a Chaplaine in ordinary to the King, gaue many reaſons in a letter againſt this mariage, and propounded a way how to ſupply the Kings wants otherwiſe, which I underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſo wrought underhand, that the Doctor was committed, and hardly eſcaped the danger of his preſumptuous admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though the ſtate knew his intent was honeſt, and his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons good. Wherein wee on the other ſide, (both here and with the <hi>Arch Duke</hi>) haue had bookes penned, and pictures printed, directly againſt their King and ſtate, for which their Ambaſſadours haue ſought ſatisfaction of us in vaine, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to ſtay the print, or ſo much as to touch the hem of the Authors garment. But wee haue an evaſion, which here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks miſſe, our Clergie being freed from the temporall ſword, and ſo not included in our treaties and conditions of peace, but at libertie to give any hereticall Prince the Mate when
<pb facs="tcp:24674:12"/>
they liſt: whereas theirs are liable to accompt and hazard, &amp; are muzled for barking, when ours may both barke and bite too. The Councell table, and the ſtar-Chamber do ſo terrifie them, as they dare not riot, but run at the ſtirrop in excellent co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, and come in at the leaſt rebuke. They call their preaching in many places ſtanding up, but they crouch and dare not ſtand up nor queſt, behaue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelves like Setters, ſilent and creeping upon their bellies, licke the duſt which our Prieſts ſhake from their beautifull feete.</p>
            <p>Now (quoth the Duke of <hi>Lerma</hi>) ſatisfie me about our owne Clergie how they fare.. For there were here Petitions made to the King in the name of the diſtreſſed, afflicted, perſecuted and impriſoned Prieſts, that his Maieſtie would intercede for them, to free them from the intollerable burdens they groned under, and to procure their liberties: and letters were directed from us to that end, that you ſhould negotiate this demand with all ſpeed and diligence.</p>
            <p>Moſt excellent Prince (replyed <hi>Gondamore</hi>) I did your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand with a kinde of command my ſelfe; not thinking it fit to make it a ſuite in your name or my Maſters, I obtained them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to walke freely up and downe, to face and outface their accuſers, Iudges, Magiſtrates, Biſhops, and to exerciſe their functions almoſt as freely altogether as ſafely as at Rome.</p>
            <p>Here the Nuntio objected, that he did not well to his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in procuring their libertie, ſince they might doe more good in priſon then abroad. Becauſe in priſon they ſeemed to be under perſecution, and ſo vvere pittied of others; and pittie of the perſon, prepares the affection further. Beſides, then they were careful over their owne lives to give no offence: but abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade they might be ſcandalous in their lives, as they uſe to be in <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Spaine,</hi> and other Catholik countreys; and ſo the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of their holyneſſe which upholds their credit and cauſe (againſt the maried Clergie) would ſoone decay.</p>
            <p>But the Ambaſſador replyed, he conſidered thoſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, but beſides a ſuperior command, he ſaw the profit of their libertie more then of their reſtraint. For now they might freely conferre, and were ever practiſing, and would doubtleſſe produce ſome worke of wonder. And beſides by reaſon of
<pb facs="tcp:24674:12"/>
their authoritie and meanes to change places, did apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to many perſons; wheras in priſon they onely could deale with ſuch as came to be caught, or were their owne before. And this (quoth he) I adde as a ſecret, that as before they were maintained by private contributions to devout Catholiques even to exceſſe, ſo much more now ſhall they be able to gather great ſummes, to weaken the State, and furniſh them for ſome high attempt, by the example of Cardinall <hi>VVoolſey</hi> barrelling up gold for <hi>Rome.</hi> And this they may eaſily doe, ſince all Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques rob the hereticall Prieſts and withhold tythes from them by fraud or force, to give to theſe of their owne to whom it is properly due: And if this be ſpied, it is an eaſie matter to lay all upon the <hi>Hollander,</hi> and ſay, he carries the coyne out of the land (who are forward enough indeed, in ſuch practiſes) and ſo ours ſhall not onely be excuſed, but a flawe made betwixt them to weaken their amities, &amp; beget ſuſpition betwixt them of each others loue.</p>
            <p>But amongſt all theſe prieſts (quoth the Inquiſitor generall) did you remember that old, reverend, father Baldwin, who had a finger in that admirable attempt made on our behalfe againſt the Parliament houſe? ſuch as he deſerving ſo highly, adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing their lives ſo reſolutely for the Catholique cauſe, muſt not be neglected, but extraordinarily regarded, thereby to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage others to the like holy undertakings.</p>
            <p>Holy father (quoth <hi>Gondamor</hi>) my principall care was of him, whoſe life and libertie when I had with much difficultie obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of the King, I ſolemnly went in perſon, attended with all my traine, and divers other well willers to fetch him out of the Tower where he was in durance. Aſſoone as I came in his ſight I behaved my ſelf after ſo lowly &amp; hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ble a maner, that our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries ſtood amazed to behold the reverence we giue to our ghoſtly fathers. And this I did to confound them &amp; their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous Clergie, and to beget an extraordinary opinion of holineſſe in the perſon, &amp; pietie in us, and alſo to provoke the Engliſh Catholiques to the like devout obediencie, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by at any time theſe Ieſuites (whoſe authoritie was ſomewhat weakened ſince the ſchiſme betwixt them and the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and the ſucceeding powder-plot) may vvorke them
<pb facs="tcp:24674:13"/>
to our ends, as Maſters their ſervants, Tutors their ſchollers, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers their children, Kings their ſubiects. And that they may doe this the more boldly and ſecurely, I haue ſomewhat daſht the authoritie of their high Comiſſion; upon which whereas there are diverſe Purſevants (men of the worſt kinde and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, reſembling our Flies &amp; Familiars, attending upon the inquiſition) whoſe office and imployment it is to diſturbe the Catholiques, ſearch their houſes for <hi>Prieſts,</hi> holy veſtments, bookes, beades, crucifixes, and the like religious appurtenances, I haue cauſed the execution of their office to be ſlackned, that ſo an open way may be given to our ſpirituall inſtruments for the free exerciſe of their faculties. And yet when theſe <hi>Purſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> had greateſt authoritie, a ſmall bribe in the Countrey would blinde their eyes, or a little greater at Court or in the Excheaquer fruſtrate and croſſe all their actions, ſo that their malice went off like ſquibs, made a great crack to fright childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and new borne babes, but hurt no old men of Catholique ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. And this is the effect of all other their courſes of procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in this kinde, in all their iudiciall Courts, whither knowne catholiques (convicted as they ſtile them) are often ſummond and cited, threatned and bound over, but the danger is paſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoon as the officer hath his fee payd to him, then the execution goeth no further. Nay upon my conſcience they are glad when there are offenders in that kinde, becauſe they are bountifull: and the officers doe their beſt to favour them, that they may increaſe, and ſo their revenue and gaine come in freely.</p>
            <p>And if they ſhould be ſent to priſon, even that place (for the moſt part) is made as a Sanctuary to them: as the old Romanes were wont to ſhut up ſuch by way of reſtreint, as they meant to preſerve from the peoples fury; ſo they live ſafe in priſon till we haue time to worke their libertie and aſſure their lives. And in the meane time their place of reſtraint is as a ſtudy unto them, where they haue opportunitie to confer together as in a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and to arme themſelves in unity againſt the ſingle adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary abroad.</p>
            <p>But (quoth the Inquiſitor generall) how doe they for boo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes, when they haue occaſion either to write or diſpute?</p>
            <p>My Lord, (replyes <hi>Gondamor</hi>) all the Libraries belonging to
<pb facs="tcp:24674:13"/>
the Romane Catholiques through the land are at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, from whence they haue all ſuch collections as they can require gathered to their hand, aſwell from thence as from all the Libraries of both Vniverſities, and even the bookes them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves if that be requiſite.</p>
            <p>Beſides I have made it a principall part of my imployment, to buy all the manuſcripts &amp; other ancient and rare Authours out of the hands of the Heretiques, ſo that there is no great Scholler dies in the land, but my Agents are dealing with his bookes. In ſo much as even their learned <hi>Iſaack Cauſabons</hi> library was in election without queſtion to be ours, had not their Vigilant King (who foreſees all dangers, and hath his eye buſie in every place) prevented my plot. For after the death of that great ſcholler, I ſent to requeſt a view &amp; catalogue of his bookes with their price, intending not to be out-vyed by any man, if mony would fetch them; becauſe (beſides the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage that ſide ſhould haue received by their loſſe, proſecuting the ſame ſtory againſt Cardinall <hi>Baronius</hi>) we might haue made good advantage of his notes, collections, caſtigations, cenſures and criticiſmes for our owne party, and framed and put out others under his name at our pleaſure. But this was foreſeene by their <hi>Prometheus,</hi> who ſent that <hi>Torturer</hi> of ours (the Biſhop of <hi>VVincheſter</hi>) to ſearch and ſort the papers, and to ſeale vp the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tudy: Giving a large and princely allowance for them to the <hi>

               </gap>iſion for her and hers. But this plot fayling at that time, hath of ever done ſo. Nor had the Vniverſitie of <hi>Oxford</hi> ſo trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed in their many manuſcripts given by that famous Knight S. <hi>Thomas Bodly,</hi> if eyther I had been then imployed, or this courſe of mine then thought upon; for I would labour what I might this way or any other way to diſarme them, and eyther to tranſlate their beſt authours hither, or at leaſt to leave none in the hands of any but Romane Catholiques who are aſſured<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ours. And to this end an eſpeciall eye would be had upon the Library of one S. <hi>Robert Cotton</hi> (an ingroſſer of Antiquities) that whenſoever it come to be broken up (eyther before his death or after) the moſt choice and ſingular pieces might be gleaned and gathered up, by a Catholique hand. Neyther let
<pb facs="tcp:24674:14"/>
any man thinke, that deſcending thus low to pettie particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars is unworthy an Ambaſſadour, or of ſmall avayle for the ends we ayme at, ſince we ſee every mountayne conſiſts of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ſands; and there is no more profitable converſing for Stateſmen then amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt ſchollers &amp; their books, ſpecially where the King for whom we watch is the King of Schollers, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ves to live almoſt altogether in their element. Beſides if by any meanes we can continue differences in their Church, or make them wider, or beget diſtaſte betwixt their Clergy and commo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Lawyer, who are men of greateſt power in the land, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit will be ours, the conſequence great, opening a way for us to come in betvveene, for perſonall quarrels produce reall que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions.</p>
            <p>As he was further proſecuting this diſcourſe, one of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries (who wayted without the chamber) deſired entrance; and being admitted, delivered letters vvhich he had nevvly received from a Poſt directed to the Preſident and the reſt of the Councell from his Catholike maſter, the contents whereof vvere to this effect.</p>
            <p>Right truſty &amp; vvelbeloved Couſens and Counſellors, we greete you wel: Wheras vve had a hope by our Agents in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Germany, to effect that great vvorke of the Weſterne Empire; and likewiſe on the other ſide to ſurprize Venice, and ſo incircling Europe at one inſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, &amp; infolding it in our armes, make the eaſier roade upon the Turke in Aſia, and at length reduce all the vvorld to our catholique commaund.

            <p>Know now that vve haue received late and ſad newes of the apprehenſion of our moſt truſty and able Penſioner <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevelt,</hi> and of the diſcovery of other our intendements; ſo that our hopes are for the preſent adjourned till ſome other more convenient and auſpicuous time.
