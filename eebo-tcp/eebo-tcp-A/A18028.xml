            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:8020:11"/>
First, because <hi>Geographie</hi> describeth the whole Spheare of the Earth, according to its iust <hi>quantity, proportion, figure,</hi> and <hi>dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,</hi> which the principall parts of it haue; as well in respect of one another, as of the whole Terrestriall Globe: so that it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vndertakes the chiefe and most noted parts, such as are sines, creekes, nations, cities, promontories, riuers, and famous moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines. But the <hi>Chorographer</hi> separatly handleth the lesser parts, and matters of smaller moment, such as are hillocks, brooks, lakes, townes, villages, and Parishes, without any respect at all to the places adioyning, as conferring them with the <hi>Sphaericall</hi> fabricke of the whole Earth: Which by the same Author is well illustrated by an example, drawne from the Painters Art: For wee see that a Painter, desirous to draw out and represent the head of any liuing creature, will first draw out the lineaments of the first and greatest parts; as the eyes, eares, nose, mouth, forehead, and such like; only caring that they may challenge a due and iust proportion and symmetrie one with the other, not regarding the lesser particles and ornaments in each of these, wanting perhaps space competent to accomplish it. But if the same Painter would striue to expresse only an eye, or an eare, he might take space enough to designe out euery smaller linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, colour, shadow, or marke, as if it were naturall: for in this he cares not to make it correspondent to the whole head, &amp; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the body: So happens it to the <hi>Geographer,</hi> who willing to delineate out any part of the Earth, (as for example, our Realme of <hi>England</hi>) he would describe it as an Iland, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compassed round with the sea, &amp; figured in a triangular forme, only expressing the principall and greater parts of it. But the <hi>Chorographer</hi> vndertaking the description of some speciall and smaller part of <hi>England</hi>; as for example, the City of <hi>Oxford,</hi> descends much more particularly to matters of small quantity and note: such as are the Churches, Colledges, Halls, Streets, Springs; giuing to each of them their due accidents, colours, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neaments, and proportion, as farre forth as Art can imitate Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Neither in this kind of description needs there any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of the places adioyning, or the generall draught of the whole Iland. The second difference betweene <hi>Geographie</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:8020:11"/>
                           <hi>Chorographie</hi> assigned by <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> consists in this; that <hi>Choro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphie</hi> is commonly conuersant in the accidentall <hi>qualities</hi> of each place, particularly noting vnto vs, which places are bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, fruitfull, sandy, stony, moist, dry, hot, cold, plain, or moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainous, and such like proprieties. But <hi>Geographie</hi> lesse regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding their qualities, inquires rather of the <hi>Quantities, measures, distances,</hi> which places haue aswell in regard one of the other, as of the whole Globe of the Earth: assigning to each region its true longitude, latitude, clime, parallell, and Meridian. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphie</hi> and <hi>Chorographie</hi> are said to differ, because <hi>Geographie</hi> stands in little need of the Art of Painting, for as much as it is conuersant the most part about the Geometricall lineaments of the Terrestriall Globe, clayming great affinity with the Art called of the <hi>Greekes, Ichnographie</hi>; whose office is to expresse the figure and proportion of bodies, set forth in a plain <hi>superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</hi> But contrariwise <hi>Corographie</hi> requires, as a help necessary, the Art of Painting; forasmuch as no man can fully and perfectly expresse to the eye the true portraict of cities, townes, castels, promontories, and such other things, in their true colours, liuely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and proportion; except they bee skilled in the Art of Painting. So that this part is by some likened to that Art which the <hi>Greekes</hi> call <hi>Sciographie,</hi> or <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>enographie.</hi> Fourthly, and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Geographie</hi> is distinguished from <hi>Chorographie,</hi> in that the former considering chiefly the quantity, measure, figure, site, &amp; proportion of places, as well in respect <hi>one of the other,</hi> as of the <hi>Heauens,</hi> requires necessary helps of the Sciences Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, chiefly of <hi>Arithmeticke, Geometrie,</hi> and <hi>Astronomie,</hi> without which a <hi>Geographer</hi> would shew himselfe euery-where lame &amp; impotent, being not able to wade thorough the least part of his profession: whereas a man altogether vnpractised in those fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, might obtaine a competent knowledge in <hi>Chorography.</hi> As we find by experience, some altogether ignorant in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicks; who can, to some content of their hearers, <hi>Topogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically,</hi> and <hi>Historically</hi> discourse of Countries, as they haue read of in books, or obserued in their trauaile. Notwithstanding all these differences assigned by <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> I see no great reason why <hi>Chorography</hi> should not bee referred to <hi>Geography;</hi> as a
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8020:12"/>
part to the whole; forasmuch as the obiects on which hee hath grounded his distinction, differ only as a generall and a speciall; which being not opposite, but subordinate (as the <hi>Logicians</hi> vse to speake) cânnot make two distinct Sciences, but are redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to one and the selfe-same: at least the differences thus assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, will not be <hi>Essentiall</hi> but <hi>Accidentall.</hi> Wherfore my scope in this Treatise shall bee to ioyne them both together in the same, so far forth as my Art and leisure shall be able, to descend to particulars; which being in <hi>Chorographie</hi> almost infinite, wil not all seeme alike necessary in the description of the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall Globe of the Earth. The name of <hi>Geographie</hi> thus distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, wee define it to be a <hi>Science</hi> which teacheth the <hi>Measure</hi> and <hi>Description</hi> of the whole <hi>Earth.</hi> It is properly tearmed a <hi>Science,</hi> because it proposeth to it selfe no other end but know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; whereas those faculties are commonly tearmed <hi>Arts,</hi> which are not contented with a bare knowledge or speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but are directed to some farther worke or action. But here a doubt seemes to arise, whether this <hi>Science</hi> be to be esteemed <hi>Physicall,</hi> or <hi>Mathematicall</hi>? Wee answer, that in a Science two things are to bee considered: first<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the <hi>matter</hi> or obiect whereabout it is conuersant; secondly, the <hi>manner</hi> of handling and explication: For the former, no doubt can bee made, but that the obiect in <hi>Geographie</hi> is for the most part <hi>Physicall,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of the parts whereof the Spheare is composed: but for the manner of Explication, it is not <hi>pure,</hi> but <hi>mixt</hi>; as in the former part <hi>Mathematicall,</hi> in the second rather <hi>Historicall</hi>; whence the whole Science may be alike tearmed <hi>Mathematical</hi> &amp; <hi>Historicall</hi>

Which restriction, although agreeing well to some part of it, will hardly square with all the rest: because many things herein are handled besides the Earths naturall site or position, as hereafter shall be taught. For which cause wee haue rather defined the subiect of <hi>Geographie</hi> to bee the <hi>Earth,</hi> so far as it is to bee measured and described, as wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one word to expresse the whole manner of considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                        </argument>
                        <p>We ought here to remember what we said before; that the Earth and the Water concurre together to make one <hi>Terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Spheare</hi>: wherefore the whole being accounted one coacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated and collected <hi>Body,</hi> made of two other; we are not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect an <hi>Internall, Essentiall,</hi> and <hi>Specificall</hi> Forme, such as <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotle</hi> recounts amongst the principles of a Naturall Body: but only such a one as in it self is <hi>Externall</hi> and <hi>Accidentall</hi>; yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring (as it were) Essentially to the constitution of the <hi>Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striall Spheare,</hi> whose Fabricke and first composition, cannot well be vnderstood without it. Some haue imagined the whole Globe of the Earth to bee informed with one Internall and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentiall Forme; which opinion seemes to haue much affinity with that of <hi>Plato's,</hi> concerning the <hi>Soule</hi> of the World: Not that <hi>Plato</hi> and his followers were so absurd to defend, that the World with all his parts was animated with a true vitall Soule, in the nature of a liuing Creature: but that all the members of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8020:16"/>
it were vnited together, quickned, and disposed by a certaine <hi>Energeticall</hi> power or vertue, which had great resemblance and representation of the Soule of man. Which assertion seemes to be restored and embraced by our late <hi>Magneticall Philosophers,</hi> whose opinion we shall discusse and examine hereafter in place conuenient. In the meane time, grounding our discourse on knowne principles; we can admit no other <hi>Forme</hi> in the <hi>Spheare</hi> of the Earth, then the mutuall <hi>Harmony,</hi> order and concent of the parts, concurring together, and working the perfection &amp; perpetuation of the whole. A fit resemblance whereof we may obserue in an artificiall Clock, Mill, or such like great Engine, wherein euery part duly performing its owne office, there will arise and result a naturall Harmony, whch not vnaptly may bee termed the Forme of the whole Engine. Why the World should not consist of an Internall and Essentiall Forme, sundry reasons haue been alleadged by our common <hi>Philosophers</hi>: First, because Nature neuer attempteth any thing in vaine, or without a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate end; But the particular Formes of speciall Bodies (say these <hi>Philosophers</hi>) are sufficient for the vnity and conformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this <hi>Terrestriall Globe</hi>: so that to grant an vniuersall Forme of the whole, were to multiply causes without any necessity, &amp; make Nature the Mother of superfluity, which to all <hi>Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers</hi> seemes most absurd. Secondly, if this were admitted; the whole <hi>Spheare</hi> of the Earth would bee as one continuate Body, whose parts should (as it were) suffer a fellow-feeling one of the other. Thirdly, it were a difficult matter to assigne, to what kind such a Forme might be reduced, whether <hi>Animate,</hi> or <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate.</hi> If Inanimate, whether it were <hi>simple,</hi> or <hi>compound.</hi> If Animate, whether <hi>Vegetatiue, Sensitiue,</hi> or <hi>Rationall</hi>; vnder the which are couched many great difficulties, as yet vndisclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Whether these reasons bee of any great force to ouerthrow the aduerse opinion, I leaue it to further inquiry: intending here a <hi>Geographicall,</hi> not a <hi>Physicall</hi> Discourse.</p>

                        <p>In the former Chapter we haue shewed, that the Forme of the <hi>Terrestriall Spheare,</hi> is nothing els but the concinnity and apt conspiration of the parts whereof the whole is compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.

All which are very pleasant &amp; profitable, to giue an industrious Learner some satisfaction. To explaine this before we descend to particulars, we will lay this ground and Theoreme;</p>

To vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand which clause the better, wee are to consider that a thing may bee called <hi>Naturall</hi> two manner of wayes: first in regard of the <hi>primary</hi> intent of Nature; as the neerest and immediate
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:8020:17"/>
end or scope to which shee is directed. Secondly, in respect of her <hi>secundary</hi> intent or purpose, as that which must of necessity follow the former. True it is that euery Terrene Body, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Natures <hi>first</hi> intention, seeks and works it's owne per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection and conseruation. Neuerthelesse according to her <hi>secun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary</hi> Intent, it concurres to the perfection and good of the whole vniuerse; which we shall plainely see in a stone or clodd of earth; which separated and remoued from it's mother, the Spheare of the Earth, by his descent and falling downewards, seeks first his owne conseruation, by reuniting it selfe to the Earth whence it was taken: Secondly, of the whole Globe of the Earth, which by this vnion and addition, no doubt, is made more compleat and perfect. This conformity of the Terrestriall parts, out of which ariseth the Earths <hi>Sphaericity</hi>; I call the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall inclination they haue to moue and settle themselues in such a site or position, as may bring forth a <hi>Sphaericall</hi> consistency: so that if it were possible (as what cannot be to Gods Almighty power?) that the whole Globe of the earth were dissolued and rent into little peeces; yet were that vigor and motiue inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion remaining in the parts, whereby they might settle and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themselues to the same <hi>Sphaericall</hi> nature, and compositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which it formerly enioyed. For all the parts thus supposed to be distracted, would (no question) meet together &amp; conforme themselues to the same point or Center; and so equally poising themselues, would restore the same Spheare so dissolued. So that wee here note a double inclination and motion of earthly bodies; first by a <hi>Right line,</hi> of the parts tending towards the Center; the other <hi>Sphericall</hi> of the whole <hi>Spheare,</hi> whereof the first in nature preceedes the composition of the Spheare, the other followes.

By these Terrestriall Bodies which inioye this motion and inclination, wee vnderstand first the two Elements of <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water,</hi> with all other bodies arising out of their mixture. To these I may adde the <hi>Ayre,</hi> which by reason of his affinity with the Earth and Water, and naturall co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>formity to the same Center, we may well tearme an earthly body.

But this assertion, although bolstred vp, both with antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and authority; I take either to bee false, or misunderstood,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:8020:18"/>
and that I speake no more herein than I can proue; I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce some reasons (strong enough, as I thinke) to perswade that the Ayre is a heauy body, hauing a due inclination and confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the Center of the Earth: First therefore will I produce this experiment. When a Well or deepe Trench is digged vp in the earth, I would willingly demand whether the Aire des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cends to fill up this Trench or concauity; or else a void space is left vnfurnished of any naturall body to fill it? If they admit the latter, they will consequently bring in againe that <hi>vacuum,</hi> or void space which <hi>Arist.</hi> and all sound Philosophers haue long since proscribed the confines of nature. If they affirme the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that the Ayre descends to fill vp this empty space, I will aske againe, whether this descent of the Ayre be violent or naturall: If they say Naturall, they admit our assertion, that the Ayre na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally descends towards the Center, and so by consequence that it is heauy and not light by nature. Neither according to our <hi>Peripateticall</hi>-Philosophy can wee ascribe more than one moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Aire, because it is a ground generally receaued among <hi>Aristoteleans</hi>: that One simple body can claime but one simple motion: much lesse one simple forme, as that of the Aire, can produce two opposite and contrary motions, such as are Ascent and Descent of the same body. If they chance to light on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther member of our distinction, and say that the motion of the Aire in this sort is violent, it must needs follow, that it must haue some externall cause or principle whence it should pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed; because all such motions proceed from externall causes. But here no such cause can be assigned: For the cause would bee either the Earth which is so made hollow, or the emptinesse, or <hi>vacuum,</hi> or at least the other parts of the Aire. That it is not the Earth, may be proued; first because no Philosopher hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer shewed any such Attractiue power to reside in the Earth, but rather the contrary; because the Earth and Ayre by most haue beene thought opposite in nature, and repugnant one to the other. Secondly, because Philosophy teacheth, that no agent can worke vpon a separate and distinct patient, except there be a meeting of the Agent and Patient in some meane<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But here in this supposition, the Earth is imagined to drawe and attract
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:8020:19"/>
the Aire, which as yet it toucheth not. That this externall cause is not the <hi>Vacuum</hi> or Emptinesse, is plaine; because it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer granted to haue any being or existence, much lesse any cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality in nature. Some perhaps will say, that not the <hi>vacuum</hi> it selfe, but the euitation and auoiding it, is the cause of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I deny not but this may in some sort be interpreted a cause, but the doubt is not answered: For wee seeke not a <hi>Finall</hi> but an <hi>Efficient</hi> cause; and a curious searcher into Nature, will hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rest in a meere finall cause. For the finall cause, so farre forth as it is a cause preceding the effect, can no otherwise bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued than in the intention of the Agent: then must enquiry bee made againe what the Agent should bee, and so will the probleme rest vncleered. 1. Because one parcell of the Aire could not moue another, except the same were first moued it selfe, and so a new Agent must of necessity bee found out. 2 The Agent and the thing moued or Patient, ought to bee two sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and distinct bodies: But the parts of the ayre meeting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, become one continuate body. No shift is there left for these Philosophers but one distinction, wherein they distinguish betwixt the <hi>Vniuersall</hi> and <hi>Speciall</hi> forme, The Aire, as they affirme, according to his <hi>Speciall</hi> forme, asc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In which distinction they suppose they haue cut the throat of all contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reasons. But who so vnderstands himselfe, shall finde it but as a weake reed, to hurt his hand which rests on it: for a second enquiry will bee made, what this vniuersall forme should bee. For by it they vnderstand of necessity either an <hi>Internall forme</hi> or Nature; or an <hi>Externall resultancie</hi> and harmony of the parts, such as wee haue described in the first Chapter of this booke. If they vnderstand this latter, it cannot any way bee a cause of this motion; because it followes and ariseth out of this motion concurring with the rest, and no way preceeds it: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the contrary part euery cause is to goe before his effect: Secondly, this vniuersall forme or nature compared with the speciall, there would arise a <hi>Subordination,</hi> and not a <hi>Coordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
                              <pb n="19" facs="tcp:8020:19"/>
or opposition; forasmuch as the speciall is subordinate to the generall or vniuersall. But subordinate causes can produce no other than subordinate eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                              </gap>ts. But here we see the effects or motions to bee quite opposite the one to the other; in asmuch as the motion of Descent in the Aire (which they ascribe to the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall forme) is cleane opposite to the motion of Ascent, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to the speciall nature. Thirdly, these <hi>Philosophers</hi> vrging the necessity of Nature to preserue the Vniuerse, are much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued in the manner and meanes thereof. True it is that all Earthly and heauy bodies are directed and disposed to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of the earthly Globe. But euery such body (as wee haue shewed before) seekes first the safeguard and preseruation of it selfe, and secondarily by the safeguard of it selfe the preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the whole. For how can any part, when it neglects its owne safety, endeauour the preseruation of the whole: sith the whole is but one compounded of many parts. And therefore can it not bee auoided, but that the disorders and disharmony of one part<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should preiudice and destroy the whole frame. If they turne to the other part, and grant this vniuersall forme to bee <hi>Internall,</hi> many reasons stand opposite. For first I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whether this vniuersall forme bee <hi>simple</hi> or <hi>compounded.</hi> It cannot bee simple, because it would alwayes produce one sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and vniforme effect: but experience hath t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ught the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; because wee shall not alwayes find the aire to descend, but sometimes to moue obliquely to the left or right hand, back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and forward; as when it enters into the house by a doore or windowe. On the other side, it cannot well be called a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound forme; because all formes the more vniuersall they are, the more simple they are to be accounted: because the speciall includes more composition than the generall. Moreouer, all compounded substance arise out of simples, which are to bee esteemed first in nature. Secondly, I would aske whether this vniuersall forme bee <hi>vna numero,</hi> the selfe same indiuiduall in all the parts and bodies; or diuerse, according to the diuersity of the said Bodies. It cannot bee one and the selfe same in all bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, because, according to the opinion of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> the whole vniuerse is not one continuate body composed of essentiall parts;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:8020:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but rather a heape or masse collected and digested out of many bodies. Secondly, the forme being thus one indiuiduall, would bee singular or speciall, not vniuersall. If they affirme that this forme is diuerse according to the diuersity of the bodies, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee the cause of this motion or descent in the Aire. For this motion (as they suppose) is destined and appointed to no other end, than to comfort Nature in her distresse, when shee stands in feare of rupture or dissolution. But how can this forme being bounded within the limits of the Aeriall <hi>superficies</hi> perceaue or feele this exigence of Nature in other Bodies? Whatsoeuer they can say in this, is altogether vncertaine, and not warranted by any sound demonstration. A second reason for the naturall des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent of the Aire, may bee drawne from a possible supposition; from which wee may enforce a true conclusion. Let vs suppose a portion of Aire by some violence to bee carried aboue his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per orbe; as for example, to the space which by our common Philosophers is ascribed to the Element of Fire, neere the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caue <hi>superficies</hi> of the Moone, I would here demand whether this portion of Aire thus transposed would ascend higher, or descend lower, or rest still in the same place? It could not ascend higher; first because in this wise it should be moued farther out of his owne place, whereas according to the principles of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophie, all bodies transposed from their proper places, haue an aptnesse or inclination to returne againe to their proper seats, and not to roue farther off. Secondly, this granted, the Aire should inuade the place of the fire and so the Elements should suffer a confusion; which <hi>Aristotle</hi> holds absurd. Thirdly, there cannot be imagined in that higher orbe any point or center, to which it should direct his motion; and therefore there is no such motion found; or it must bee very irregular. If on the other side it were granted, that such a portion of Aire so separated, should descend; I aske againe, whether they hold this motion <hi>naturall</hi> or <hi>violent</hi>: It cannot bee a violent motion, because it is directed to his owne naturall and proper place; and this motion in the Elements, is alwayes accounted naturall. Last of all, it cannot rest still in the same place, because all bodies forced out of their places (all obstacles being remoued) must
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:8020:20"/>
needs returne vnto their proper place. Wherefore no other star<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hole is here left to our opposites, but that they grant a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall motion, and so consequently yeeld to our assertion. A third reason may here bee drawne from the condensation of the Aire. It is a receiued opinion amongst most Philosophers, that the thinne and subtile parts of the Aire will naturally mount vpward; but the thicker and condensated parts, pitch and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle themselues downeward: Which obseruation, if it bee true, will yeeld vs this conclusion. That the Aire is by nature heauy, and therefore moueth downeward, toward the center of the Sphericall Globe of the Earth. Which I will demonstrate out of these Principles, 1 That that body, which by addition of parts or condensation, is made more heauy or ponderous, must needs haue some weight in it selfe. This may easily appeare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the mixture of lightnesse with heauinesse will not intend and encrease the ponderosity, but slacke and diminish it. For the chiefest thing which remits or diminisheth any quality, is the mixture of his contrary, as wee see the quality of cold to be abated and weakened if it entertaine any mixture of heat: 2 The thickning or condensation of any body is made by addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and coaction of more parts into the same space or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe. As if the Aire or any such like body were thickned, it would confine it selfe to a more narrow roome then before, and so consequenly the narrow roome would containe more parts then before. Out of which wee conclude, that forasmuch as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts pressed together in the same space, make the whole masse more ponderous; these parts so pressed together, must needes haue some waight in themselues. Which may further be illustrated; because the intention of the quality commonly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes the condensation of the subiect: Which may easily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare in red-hot-iron, which burnes and scorcheth more than flame or coales; because euery part hath more degrees or heat. Now where more parts are closely pressed together, the heat must needs bee more feruent. I haue dwelt longer on this sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, because I would not seeme to broach a new opinion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out sufficient reason. To conclude all, and come as neere the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued opinion as I can; I will say, that the Aire may bee consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:8020:21"/>
two wayes; first <hi>absolutely</hi> in it selfe; secondly in <hi>compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison</hi> of heauier bodies, to wit, the <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Water.</hi> In the first sense I grant no absolute lightnesse in the Aire; because out of his naturall inclination, it tends as neere as it can to the center, as all other lower bodies. But if we consider it comparatiuely in respect of other heauier bodies, we may call it light, that is, lesse heauy or ponderous. So that by <hi>lightnesse</hi> we vnderstand no <hi>absolute</hi> lightnesse, but a <hi>priuation.</hi> The summe of all wee haue hitherto proued, is this; That all terrene bodies, as Earth, Water, Aire, and other mixt bodies which concurre to the composition of the Earthly Spheare, as neere as they can, settle and conforme themselues to the center of the Earth; which site or position of them to the center, is their true and naturall place, wherein they seeke their preseruation.</p>

                           <p>The increment or increase of any effect, must necessarily arise from the greater vigour or efficacy of the efficient cause, as both Reason and Philosophie well teach. Now (as wee haue shewed) all heauy bodyes naturally do descend downeward, out of a naturall inclination they haue to attaine the center: but where there is a greater weight or constipation of ponderous parts in the same masse, there must needs proceede a greater inclination: Supposing then the <hi>Earth, Water,</hi> and <hi>Aire,</hi> being three waighty bodies to incline and dispose themselues to their vttermost force to inclose and engirt the center of the Terrestri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Spheare; it must needes bee that the <hi>Earth</hi> beeing the most compact and ponderous, must obtaine the preheminence; next to which succeedes the <hi>Water,</hi> then the <hi>Aire,</hi> being of all other
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8020:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the least ponderous. Yet wee deny not but the Water and Aire being setled in this wise, are in their naturall places; which to vnderstand, wee must repeate what we said before, that Nature hath a twofold <hi>intention</hi>; the one <hi>primary,</hi> the other <hi>secondary.</hi> Indeed if we consider Natures primary or speciall inclination in the bodies themselues, we shall finde them (as wee said) imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly directed to the center as neere as might bee: but the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condary intent of Nature was, that the bodies should so settle and conforme themselues, as that each of them should obtaine a place according to his degree of massinesse and waight. Out of this may bee answered a certaine obiection which some haue produced, to proue the Aire to bee absolutely light in his owne nature. Experience teacheth vs (say these men) that a bladder blowne vp with winde, or an empty barrell being by force kept vnder water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the force and obstacle omitted, will suddenly ascend to the top; and that a man ready to sinke in the Water, will not so easily sinke downe while hee can hold his breath: all which effects they ascribe to no other cause, than to inclination of the Aire to moue vpwards from the center. But indeed this motion, howbeit agreeable to the vniuersall nature and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stency of the Spheare, is notwithstanding in respect of the Aire it selfe, vnnaturall and violent; because this ascent of it is not caused by the forme of the Aire, but the interposition of a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uier body striuing for the same place, and so reuerberating it backe from the place, whereunto it tended. For here is to bee imagined, that the bladder or empty barrell drowned in the water, claimes and inioyes for the time that place or distance, which otherwise so much water should occupie; to wit, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inches of feete from one side to the other. No maruell then that obstacles remoued, the Water being most ponderous and waighty, receiues his owne right; and (as it were) shoulders out the Aire, and violently driues it off to his owne habitation. Whence many haue imagined that this motion is proper and naturall to the Aire, when of it selfe it is meerely violent, and enforced by the interiection of another body more waighty and ponderous than it selfe.</p>

                           </argument>
                           <p>A Right line is the measure and rule almost of all <hi>Naturall</hi> actions: which albeit it be familiar in almost euery operation; yet most of all in the motion of the Earthly bodies tending to the center of the Earth. Why <hi>Nature</hi> in this kind should chiefly affect a <hi>Right</hi> line, sundry reasons may bee alleaged: 1 From the <hi>End</hi> which Nature doth propose it selfe, which is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the worke which shee intends, the readiest and shortest way; as <hi>Aristotle</hi> testifies of her in the 5 of his <hi>Metaphisickes.</hi> Now it is manifest that a Right line drawne betwixt the same points, is alwayes shortest, as <hi>Euclide</hi> shewes in his <hi>Elements</hi>; where hee demonstrates that two sides of any <hi>triangle</hi> being counted together, are longer then the third. The better to vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand the working of <hi>Nature,</hi> wee shall obserue in the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a heauy part to the center, a double scope or end; first, that the said part of a <hi>terrestriall</hi> body, should bee moued or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the place to which it is by violence transposed. Secondly, that this body should bee restored home, and vnited to the <hi>Sphericall</hi> substance of the Earth, in which it must chiefly seeke its preseruation. That these two ends are best and soonest compassed by a right line is most manifest: For first a <hi>sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration</hi>
                              <pb n="28" facs="tcp:8020:24"/>
from the place to which it is moued, is more quicke &amp; expedient by a right line; forasmuch as crooked and circular lines, turne backe as it were into themselues againe. Also the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and coniunction of a part with the <hi>Spheare</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> is most indebted to a right motion, because (as wee haue declared) the way is shorter. Secondly, it may bee alleaged, that <hi>Nature</hi> is an <hi>vniforme</hi> and necessary Agent, restrained to one only bound or end, and therefore can neither strengthen, weaken, remit or suspend the action, but workes alwayes by the same meanes, the same effects; whence it is that she chuseth a right line, being but one betwixt two points; whereas crooked lines may bee drawne infinite, and the motion directed by crooked lines would proue various and opposite to the prescript of Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Moreouer should wee imagine that nature at any time wrought by a <hi>crooked</hi> or circular line, it might be demanded, from what Agent this obliquity should arise? not from Nature it selfe: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause (as wee said) shee worketh alwayes to the vtmost of her strength, hauing no power to remit or suspend her actio<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Neither comes this Deflexion from the <hi>medium,</hi> or Aire; because it can haue no such power to resist. Thirdly, if the motion were not performed in a right line, it could haue no opposite or contrary; because (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> teacheth) <hi>To a circular or crooked motion,</hi>

                              </gap>e, that the Earth from the North to the South, is round and Sphericall. For if otherwise the Earth were <hi>plaine,</hi> all the Northerne starres would appeare to the inhabitants of the Southerne Regions; and on the other side, all the other Southerne constellations would bee seene of the Northerne inhabitants, which sense and reason altogether contradict. <hi>Secondly,</hi> that the Earth is round accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to its <hi>Longitude</hi> betwixt East and West, may bee proued by two reasons. The first is taken from the rising and setting of the <hi>Sunne, Moone,</hi> and other Starres, for as much as all they doe not arise or set with all Nations at the same houres. For with the inhabitants of the East, the Sun-rising is sooner; with the Westerne inhabitants later; and that in such proportion, that euery 15 degrees measured out by the Sunnes diurnall moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, adds or subtracts one whole houre in the length of the day. This is found by experience and testimony of <hi>Cosmographers,</hi> that the Sunne riseth with the <hi>Persian,</hi> inhabiting toward the East, foure houres sooner then to the <hi>Spaniard</hi> in the West. Sundry other the like examples may bee alleaged; all which we must needes impute to the Sphericall roundnesse of the Earth, proportionally increasing betwixt East and West. The other reason to confirme this last point, is drawne from the Ecclipses of the Sunne and Moone, which would not appeare in diuers places, at diuers houres, if the Earth were plaine or square. We see plainly that Ecclipses of the Moone appeare sooner to the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8020:27"/>
Westerne people, but later to the Easterne. As (according to <hi>Ptolomie</hi>) in <hi>Arbela</hi> a towne of <hi>Assyria</hi> (where <hi>Alexander</hi> ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Darius</hi> the last King of the <hi>Persians</hi>) was there obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued an Ecclipse at the fifth houre of the night,<note place="margin">

In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner an Ecclipse of the
<figure/>
Sunne at <hi>Campania</hi> which was obserued betwixt 8 and 9. was (as <hi>Pliny</hi> reports) seene in <hi>Armenia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt 10 and 11 of the clocke.<note place="margin">
                                 <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 72.</note> Whence may be gathered that this difference of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance arose from the roundnesse of the Earth, interposing it selfe betwixt these two places. Another reason to proue the <hi>Spericall</hi> figure of the Earth, is drawne from the <hi>Ecclipse</hi> of the <hi>Moone,</hi> wherein the obscured point is described by a <hi>Sphericall</hi> figure, which must needs argue, that the body which causeth the shadow, is also round. For as the <hi>Optickes</hi> teach vs, the shadow is wont to follow and imitate the opacous body whence it proceedes, and all men confesse that the <hi>Ecclipse</hi> of the <hi>Moone</hi> is made by the interposition of the Spheare of the Earth betwixt the Sun &amp; Moone, intercepting the beames of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which should illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate &amp; lighten the <hi>Moone.</hi> The third reason may be taken from the absurdities which would follow, should we admit any other figure besides. For granting it to be <hi>plaine</hi> (as some of the <hi>Plato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists</hi> haue imagined) it would necessarily follow in reason; 1 That the <hi>Eleuation</hi> of the Pole would bee the same in all the parts of the Earth. 2 That there Would bee the same <hi>face</hi> and appearance of the Heauens in all places. 3 That the Sunne and Moone, with other starres, would in all places arise alike at the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8020:28"/>
same houres. 4 That all <hi>Ecclipses</hi> would appeare to all places at the same houres. 5 That the same <hi>quantity</hi> of dayes &amp; nights would bee at all places. 6 That the <hi>shadowes</hi> would bee euery where alike; and one Region would not bee hotter or colder then another; all which would plainly stand opposite to reason and experience. As many or more would proue the absurdities of those, that ascribe to the Earth any other figure then Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall. Which I willingly passe ouer, as not willing to fight with shadowes, and faigne an opposition, where I scarce finde an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary. These reasons are sufficient to proue, that the whole masse of the <hi>Earth</hi> is <hi>Sphericall.</hi> Diuers other popular argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be drawne from the <hi>finall</hi> cause to countenance this Assertion. For no other figure can bee assigned to the Earth, which can more vphold the order of Nature, or speake the wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Omnipotent Creator. 1 Because such a Figure would best beseeme the Earth, the seate and dwelling-place of all liuing Creatures, which is most capable: because otherwise the God of Nature would seeme to doe something in vaine, and without cause: Forasmuch as the same <hi>capacity</hi> might bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined within stricter bounds.

roundnesse, and swelling of the water; which, if the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance be great, interposeth it selfe betweene the station on the Land and the Ship where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Passengers are conueyed, which experiment is expressed in this Diagramme here anne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xed. Certaine <hi>Platonicks,</hi> of which the chiefest is <hi>Patricius</hi> a late Writer, would ascribe
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:8020:29"/>
this experiment to the impediment of the sight, caused partly by the distance wich cannot perfectly represent the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, partly by the interposed vapours arising in the Sea; part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the quiuering light which is spread by the refraction of the Sun-beames in the water. I deny not but these causes may somewhat hinder, and cause that the true and perfect <hi>species</hi> of a body cannot alwayes visit the sight. Yet will it bee euident that this is not all, but that the <hi>Sphericall</hi> roundnesse of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will proue a greater impediment where the <hi>distance</hi> is any thing greater. But for one of <hi>Patricius</hi> his shifts concerning va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour arising out of the Sea, (to which <hi>Clauius</hi> seemes also to consent in his Commentary vpon <hi>Iohannes de Sacrobosco</hi>) it makes more for our assertion then his. For that which is seene in a thicke <hi>medium,</hi> according to the doctrine of the <hi>Opticks,</hi> seemes greater in quantity, and by consequence neerer, and so higher then would otherwise appeare: as wee see by experience, that the <hi>Sunne</hi> sometimes is seene of vs before it ascend aboue the <hi>Horizon,</hi> because of a refraction of it's beames in a <hi>thicke matter.</hi> Wherefore it were rather to be imagined, that a tower seene at Sea, or a ship from the land, through these thicke and grosse <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours,</hi> should appeare higher, and seeme neerer then if it met not with such vapours. Secondly, what is vrged concerning the trembling <hi>light,</hi> caused by a refraction of the Sun-beames in the water, is of no force: For although such a light might cause an impediment or hinderance to the sight; yet would not this decrement or hinderance bee by degrees and in such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as we find it to be correspondent, to wit, to the distance interposed. And much wonder it is that <hi>Patricius</hi> (as my learned Friend M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                              <hi>R. Hues</hi> obserues) being, as it seemes very well read in the stories of <hi>Spanish</hi> nauigations, should not bee conuinced out of the Navigation of <hi>Magellane,</hi> who taking his iourney toward the <hi>Southwest</hi> parts, passed by the <hi>Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane</hi> straights, now called by his name, and so returned by the <hi>Cape of Good Hope</hi> into <hi>Spaine,</hi> to which wee way adde the voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages of <hi>Drake, Candish,</hi> and many others. The second reason is vrged by <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> booke <hi>de coelo,</hi> and hath its ground in <hi>Archimedes lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de Aqua-vectis,</hi> which is formed in this
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:8020:30"/>
sort. The nature of the water is to affect and flow to the lower place, whence it must necessarily bee inferred that it must bee round, for otherwise it should not alwayes obtaine the lower place. The reason of the consequence shall bee expressed in this
<figure/>
figure; for if we ascribe to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a plaine superficies, let it for example bee ADB, and from the center of the earth C let there be described a circle, to wit, EGF, then let there be drawne CD, a perpendicular line to AB, and let AC and BC be ioyned together. Now because the right line CD is lesse then CA, or CB, as will appeare euidently by sense; it will be plaine that the point D will be in a lower place then the point A or B, because D is neerer to the Center; for as much as DC is but a part of a beame of the circle whereas AC and CB euidently exceed that quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity or proportion. Another reason there is, commonly drawne from the roundnes of drops cast on the sand, as also from water in pots, whose <hi>superficies</hi> seemes to swell aboue the brimmes; but this reason, as we shall proue in place conuenient, is rather against this assertion then for it; because indeed, wee affirme the water to be round<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but so as it claimes the same <hi>Center</hi> with the <hi>Center</hi> of the <hi>Terrene</hi> Globe; and therefore cannot be sensible in so little a portion, as a drop, or pot of water. This proposition being sufficiently proued by these two reasons; it is needfull in the second place that wee answer certaine obiections cast in by the said <hi>Patricius</hi> against our assertion. Euery <hi>surface</hi> of the water (quoth <hi>Patricius</hi>) is either only plaine, or only round, or both plaine and round, or neither plaine nor round: First that it is not both <hi>plaine</hi> and <hi>round,</hi> seemes very euident, for so it should admit of <hi>contrariety</hi>: Neither can one part be <hi>plaine</hi> and another <hi>round,</hi> because the water is an vniforme and homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneall body, not consisting of such vnequall parts: that it should neither bee plaine nor round seemes more impossible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Whence he concludes, that this proceeds not from the roundnesse of the Earth, but from some other cause. But this argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to iudicious men will seeme very weake, 1 Because it depends altogether on the authority and credit of <hi>Patricius,</hi> whose assertion I take to bee no better then another mans deniall. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> were this argument euery where sound, yet would it proue no other thing, but that this effect were not to be imputed to the Sphericall swelling of the Earth. Whence cannot bee drawne any generall conclusion, that the <hi>Earth</hi> or <hi>Water</hi> is not <hi>Sphericall.</hi> Wee deny not in the meane time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that other causes sometimes concurre, which may hinder or take away the sight of obiects from those who saile on the Sea. The second experiment, <hi>Patricius</hi> describes in this manner. At a certaine Towne called <hi>Coma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>lum</hi> (saith hee) there is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great poole; through which poole or lake some 3 yeares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, it was my chance to bee carried in a boat. The bottome of the water almost all the way in all the iourney appeared to bee lesse then 2 foot in depth from the top. The way increasing, at first the lower parts and foundations of houses, then the tops and princely pinnacles began to vanish from our sight: at last hauing scarce passed 6000 paces, a Tower 72 foot high began to appeare, as it were cut off by the middle, and from the middle part vpward appeared visible; but after 10000 paces it was taken out of sight: I would here aske the <hi>Geographers</hi> (quoth <hi>Patricius</hi>) whether in so short a distance, wherein the bottome for the whole space surpassed not two foot in depth, the water could ascend to 72 foot? Had it beene my chance to haue gone with <hi>Patricius</hi> ouer the lake, I might perhaps by obseruation of this experiment, haue giuen a more probable coniecture of the cause. Neuerthelesse being vnacquainted aswell with the place, as the truth of his obseruation, I may perhaps guesse somewhat at his errour. First then, whereas hee auerres, that passing along for the space of a 1000 paces, a <hi>Tower</hi> of 72 foot high, seemed cut off by the midst, which at 10000 vanished
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:8020:31"/>
out of sight. I confesse that in so short a space the swelling of the water inter-posed, could not be so great as to hinder the sight, and bee the cause of this effect: wherefore some other <hi>Acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall</hi> cause must bee sought out. For the finding out of which to come as neere as I can, I would make inquiry, whether this passage of the <hi>Boat</hi> was directly <hi>forward</hi> from the Tower on the Water, no land inter-posed: or <hi>Indirectly</hi> side-wise, in such sort, as the shoare might be placed betwixt their sight and the Tower mentioned: The former no wayes can be imagined; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as much as it not only contradicts the grounds of our receiued <hi>Philosophie</hi>; but also of <hi>Patricius</hi> himselfe: for giuing the Earth a <hi>plaine</hi> surface, or <hi>Angular,</hi> or any other forme, it were impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible that in so short a distance, such an effect should happen out of the figurature of the water. If the passage were <hi>oblique</hi> or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct, in such wise as the shoare might any way inter-pose it selfe betwixt the <hi>Boat</hi> and the <hi>Tower,</hi> it were easie to imagine how such an experiment should happen: for the land by which the Boat might bee carried, might haue an ascent by such De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, as the Tower at 1000 paces might bee for the halfe of it obscured, and at last bee altogether taken out of sight. This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son then of <hi>Patricius,</hi> seemes rather to bee ascribed to the Land then the Water. The third reason of <hi>Patricius</hi> is drawne from the <hi>Homogeneity</hi> of the Water. If the water (saith hee) haue a round <hi>superficies,</hi> the parts of it would challenge the like figure, because in <hi>homogeneall</hi> bodies, the same reason is to bee giuen of the <hi>whole,</hi> and of the <hi>parts</hi>: But the parts of the water are not Sphericall, as may bee proued by diuers instances: 1 Because water in the mouth of a pot, seemes not to haue any such <hi>Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall</hi> roundnesse: for although at the brinke it seeme to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained aboue the pot, yet no such swelling appeares in the middle. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> That riuers are kept in by their bankes, which o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise would flow abroad. 3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> That riuers, when by the mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of snow, they swell so great, as they can hardly bee contay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned within their bankes, doe not seeme higher in the middle, then in other places. 4<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> If any man from one side of the riuer to the other, leuels at any marke, he may surely hit it: which hee should not doe, if there were any Sphericall swelling in the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:8020:31"/>
midst, which might hinder the sight. 5<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> and lastly it seemes so vnlikely, that the water should rise in the midst, that it is more probable it should be more hollow; in that we plainly obserue that all filth and rubbish carried from the bankes into the riuer, is wont to settle and swimme in the midst. Notwithstanding all these argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts of <hi>Patricius,</hi> our ground is yet vnshaken; 1 Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning small drops, and water in the mouth of pots; it is found to be round and Sphericall, though not exactly: the reason wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of wee shall declare hereafter. This roundnesse, I confesse, serues not any way to the confirmation of this assertion, because the <hi>Sphericity</hi> and roundnes which wee auerre to be in Water, hath for its center, the center of the whole Earth: and therefore in so small an arch or section, as the bredth of a pot, or a drop of water, cannot possibly haue any sensible appearance or existence. And we must needs confesse, that this experiment was very fondly vrged to this purpose by some of our <hi>Geographers,</hi> and such as stands not with any demonstration. Which granted, sufficiently answers all the reasons last vrged by <hi>Patricius,</hi> except the last. For as much as he requires in the Water, a sensible appearance of this roundnesse in euery riuer or little parcell of water, which cannot bee admitted. Touching the last thing which hee vrgeth, that all the rubbish and filthy matter, is from the bankes carryed into the middle, whence he would inferre<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the middle to be hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and lowest; we can answer diuers wayes: 1 That this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment is not alwayes certaine, because euery man may often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times see the contrary; to wit, that such filthy rubbish rather vseth to cleaue to the banks of the riuer, then to float into the midst. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> That if any such thing happen, it is because of the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents which run violently from the banks into the midst, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with it such things as are light, the steepnesse of the place being greater, the current wider or swifter. But nothing here can bee concluded to proue the water according to his naturall force, to be either plaine or hollow in the midst, which this Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary vndertooke to demonstrate.</p>

                           <p>A <hi>Magneticall</hi> Body by some is defined to bee that which seated in the Aire, doth place it selfe in one place <hi>naturall,</hi> not alterable. This situation is supposed to agree to all the Starres<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> especially to the great Globes of <hi>Saturne, Iupiter, Mars,</hi> and the <hi>Sunne</hi>; as also to such as giue their attendance on them, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly detected by the Trunk-spectacle; to wit, those two Starres which moue about <hi>Saturne,</hi> the foure which moue about <hi>Iupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> the two which circle about the <hi>Sunne,</hi> as <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie</hi>; and lastly the <hi>Moone,</hi> which encompasseth the Spheare of the Earth. But to let passe those other Globes, as farther off, and therefore lesse subiect to our search: our discourse shall only touch the Earth whereon wee liue, which wee shall proue to partake of a certaine Magneticall vertue or inclination: which to shew more openly, we must vnderstand, that all Magneticall Globes haue some parts of their bodies which bee also Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, which being diuorced from their proper Spheare, &amp; mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no obstacle, will settle themselues to the naturall situation of their peculiar <hi>Orbes.</hi> Which wee may plainly perceiue in the Spheare of the Earth, wherein wee shall find two <hi>Magneticall</hi> minerals; whereof the one is the <hi>Load-stone,</hi> attracting iron or steele; the other the <hi>Iron</hi> or steele it selfe: either ofthese two<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> artificially hanged in the Aire, or placed in a little boat on the water, all incombrances being remoued, will conforme &amp; settle their <hi>parts</hi> and <hi>Poles</hi> correspondent to the poles and parts of the Terrestriall Spheare, as <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South.</hi> This hath been found in all parts of the Earth by such as haue trauelled round about her, as <hi>Drake</hi> and <hi>Candish,</hi> whose Compasses were alwayes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected Magnetically in all places which they passed: which we cannot ascribe to any other cause then the <hi>disponent</hi> faculty of the Earth's Magneticall Spheare, as shall appeare hereafter by demonstration. Moreouer it hath been obserued by such as saile <hi>Northerly</hi> and <hi>Southerly,</hi> that the Magneticall <hi>Inclinatory</hi> nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, in euery eleuation of the Pole is conformed and disposed to the Axell of the Earth, according to certaine angles answerable
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8020:33"/>
to the latitude of the Region, as wee shall shew hereafter. This diuersity of conformity must necessarily arise, either from the <hi>Magneticall</hi> instrument in it selfe <hi>absolutely</hi> considered, or els from the <hi>Harmony</hi> and correspondency it hath with the Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene Globe. It cannot be the first; because it should bee the same in all places and Regions of the Earth, which is contrary to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and our supposition. Then must wee needes deriue it from the Magneticall <hi>disponent</hi> vertue of the whole Globe of the Earth, from which vertue the whole Earth may bee called Magneticall. Nay if we truely consider, these Magneticall affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions <hi>primarily</hi> agree to the Earth, as the mother of all Magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall bodies; but afterward <hi>secondarily</hi> are deriued into the parts; because (as <hi>Gilbert</hi> relates it) the cause of magneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call motions and affections is the magneticall <hi>forme</hi> of a <hi>Spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> Globe; which forme first agrees to the whole Globe of the Earth, and so is deriued to all his <hi>homogeneall</hi> parts. These parts are called <hi>Homogeneall,</hi> not in regard of their <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity,</hi> but in respect of their <hi>Magneticall nature,</hi> and <hi>communion,</hi> which in euery part is conspicuous. If any man should wonder why the Earth should bee called Magneticall in regard of this minerall, which seemes one of the least and scarcest substances whereof it consisteth; we may many wayes answer, First, that although the surface of the Earth seemes for the most part com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of other materials, more conuenient for the vse of liuing Creatures which dwell therein: yet may infinite rocky mines of Magnets be couched lower toward the center, which streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then and consolidate the Earthly Globe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Secondly, wee must not imagine the Magneticall substance of the Earth, to bee all one kinde of stone, but various: for somewhere it is hard &amp; so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lide as the true magnet it selfe and the iron which is nothing els but a mettall decocted out of the Load-stone; (for <hi>iron O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Wherefore the vigour magneticall in this Pole is most eminent and remarkable, but in the middle spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; as for example in F, the magneticall quality is so far streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thened, as the portion of the Equinoctiall plaine H, can giue.

                              <hi>Ridley</hi> in his late Magneticall Treatise, in the 6. Chapt. seemes to oppose this Demonstration.

This motion is commonly called <hi>Attraction,</hi> but improperly, as is obserued by D. <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.</hi> 1 Because <hi>Attraction</hi> seemes to suppose an externall force or violence, by which one thing is carryed and moued vnto an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other: but the <hi>Coition</hi> is meerely naturall, as proceeding from the internall forme of both the bodies. 2 Attraction supposeth the force of mouing to bee onely in the one party, and the other to bee meerely passiue, and not actiuely concurring to this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereas in the magneticall coition, both parts are mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally inclined by nature to meet and ioyne themselues one to the other. Not that the force of motion in both parts is alwayes equall: because one magneticall body is greater and stronger then the other, and then the one part seemes to stand still and draw the other vnto it, although there bee in this part so resting an inclination to the other; which mutuall inclination of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction in magnets, we may easily see in two magnets of equall quantity and vertue, which being set at a conuenient distance, will so moue, that they will meet in the mid-way. Some haue gone about to parallel this <hi>Attractiue</hi> force of the Load-stone with the <hi>Attractiue</hi> force of <hi>Ieat</hi> or <hi>Amber,</hi> which wee see by a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:8020:37"/>
naturall vertue to draw vnto it selfe little strawes, and other such like matter. But hee that truely vnderstands the nature of a magneticall body, shall finde a great disparity: First, because the Ieat or Amber which are comprised vnder the name of <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctricall</hi> bodies, drawes vnto it by reason of his <hi>Matter</hi>: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as otherwise the cause of the <hi>Magneticall Coition</hi> is to bee sought in the <hi>forme,</hi> as being too subtile a thing to spring from a materiall substance. Secondly, <hi>Electricall</hi> bodies draw and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract not without rubbing and stirring vp of the matter first; and presently faile, if any vapour or thicke body should be interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. But in a magneticall motion wee find no such matter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it requires no such preparation or rubbing of the stone, nor is hindred by interposition of solid bodies, as wee proue in this place. Thirdly, the Load-stone moues and prouokes to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nothing els but other magneticall bodies; but the <hi>Electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> will draw any little thing as straw, haire, dust, and such like. Fourthly, the Magnet will lift a great waight according to his vertue and quantity; but Ieat the smallest and lightest things. Lastly, the <hi>Electricall</hi> bodies, as <hi>Gilbert</hi> well confirmes by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments, draw other bodies vnto them by reason of a <hi>moist</hi> effluence of vapours, which hath a quality of ioyning bodies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: as wee see by the example of two stickes in water at a certaine distance, which will commonly moue till they meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. But the <hi>magneticall coition</hi> cannot bee other then an act of the magneticall forme. Of the cause of it many Philosophers haue freely spent their vncertaine coniectures, rather out of a feare to bee esteemed ignorant, then of confidence to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted learned. Most run vpon the forme of the mixt body, which growes from the composition of the foure Elements; but this opinion is very feeble, and cannot goe without crouches: for sith all mixt formes grow out of the temperament and disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they adde nothing to the thing compounded, but diuersly modificate what was before in the simple Elements; it cannot bee imagined how such an affection as this should bee onely found in the magnet, and no other mixt body. Indeed we ascribe this affection to the <hi>forme</hi> as the immediate cause; but by this <hi>forme</hi> we vnderstand not the forme of the <hi>mixture,</hi> resulting out
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:8020:37"/>
of the mixture and temperature of the foure qualities; but the <hi>magneticall</hi> forme of all globous bodies, such as are the <hi>Sunne<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Moone, Starres,</hi> and this <hi>Terrestriall Spheare</hi> whereon we liue, whose natures receiued the stampe in the first creation for the preseruation of this integrity.

For my owne part, I content my selfe with a rule of <hi>Biel</hi> the Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; That when an immediate effect proceeds from an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate cause, wee ought not to search farther why such a cause should produce such an effect. Euey man being demanded why the <hi>fire</hi> is <hi>hot,</hi> is ready to flye to the <hi>forme</hi> of <hi>fire,</hi> and alleage this as the cause: but should hee inquire further, why the forme of fire should bee the cause of heat, hee might perhaps puzzell a whole Academie of Philosophers, and neuer proue himselfe the wiser.

More probable by farre, and conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to experience, shall wee finde their opinion, which would haue the cause of this variation be in the Inequality of the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall Eminencies scattered in the Earth. This Inequality may bee perceiued to bee twofold. 1 in that some parts of the Earth haue the magneticall minerals more then other parts; for as much as the <hi>Superficies</hi> of some parts is solid Earth, as in great Continents: 2, Because although the whole Globe of the Earth is supposed to be magneticall, especially in the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall and profound parts: yet the magneticall vertue belonging to those parts, is not alwayes so vigorous and eminent as in some other parts: as wee see one Load-stone to be stronger or weaker then another in vertue and power: but of those two, the former is more remarkable, which may bee shewed by experience of such as haue sailed along many seacoa-stes: for if a sea-iourney bee made from the shore of <hi>Guinea</hi> by <hi>Cape Verde</hi> by the <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> Ilands, the bounds of the Kingdome of <hi>Morocco,</hi> from thence by the confines of <hi>Spaine, France, England, Belgia, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, Denmarke, Noruegia</hi>: we shall find toward the East, great and ample Continents; but contrarywise in the West a huge &amp; vast Ocean: which is a reason that the magneticall needle will vary from the true point of the <hi>North,</hi> and inclines rather to the <hi>East</hi>; because it is more probable that these Continents and Lands should partake more of this magneticall minerall, then the parts couered with the Sea, in which these magneticall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may bee scarcer, or at the least deeper buried, and not so
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8020:41"/>
forceable. On the contrary part, if wee saile by the <hi>American</hi> coasts, we shall rather find the <hi>variation</hi> to be Westward: as for example, if a voyage be made from the confines of <hi>Terra Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi> by <hi>Virginia, Norumbega,</hi> and so Northward, because the land butteth on the West: but in the middle spaces, neere the <hi>Canary</hi> Ilands, the <hi>directory</hi> needle respects the true Poles of the Terrestriall Globe, or at least shewes very little variation. Not for the agreement of the <hi>Magneticall</hi> Meridian of that place with the true by reason of the Rocke of Load-stone, as some haue imagined: because in the same <hi>Meridian</hi> passing by <hi>Brasile,</hi> it fals out farre otherwise: but rather because of the Terrestriall Continents on both sides, which almost diuide the Magneticall vigour, so that the Magneticall needle is not forced one way more then another; the manner whereof wee shall finde in <hi>D.

Let there bee placed a magneticall <hi>directory</hi> needle in H; it will (according to their assertion) tend to the point B, by the magneticall Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an H B; which because it concurres with the true Meridian B A, or H A, there will be no variation at all, but a true direction to the North Pole of the Earth. But let this magneticall needle be placed in the point D, it is certaine, according to this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that it will tend to the Pole of the Loadstone B, by the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall Meridian D B.

But this hath often been proued otherwise by diuerse experiments of Nauigations, mentioned by <hi>Gilbert,</hi> and <hi>F. Wright.</hi> I will only produce one or two. If a ship saile from the <hi>Sorlinges</hi> to <hi>New-found-land,</hi> they haue obserued, that when they come so farre as to finde the <hi>Compasse</hi> to point directly <hi>North,</hi> without any variation at all; then passing onward, there will bee a <hi>variation</hi> toward the <hi>North-East,</hi> but obscure and little: then afterward will the <hi>Arch</hi> of this <hi>variation</hi> increase with like space in a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, vntill they approach neere the <hi>

this, if there were two such magneticall Poles, there can be but one common <hi>Meridian,</hi> passing by them and the Poles of the Earthly Globe. But by many obseruations collected and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued by <hi>Ed.

                           <p>It is manifest out of that which wee haue spoken, that this motion of <hi>Declination</hi> supposeth two motions; The one of <hi>Conuersion,</hi> whereby the needle is turned round on his owne <hi>Axis</hi>: The other a <hi>Progressiue</hi> motion, whereby the center it selfe of the <hi>Inclinatory</hi> Needle is carryed forward vpon a Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian from North to South, or contrarywise. These two moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons supposed to proceed and beginne together, cannot possibly meet in such Equality, as that the degrees of <hi>Declination</hi> directly answer in Equality to the degrees of <hi>latitude,</hi> which is demonstrated by this Figure
<figure/>
here inserted. Let the magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall body bee A, this body while it shall bee moued aboue the Earth from GD the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall</hi> toward the Pole B, will bee turned vpon his owne Center, and in the middle of the progresse of the center from the Equator to the Pole B, it will be directed to the Equator D in the middle betweene the two Poles. Therefore the middle must needes turne faster on his owne center, then the center it selfe turned forward; that by this conuersion it should directly respect the point D: wherefore this motion will bee swifter in the first degrees, to wit, from A to L, but in the latter it will be slower from L to B, in respect of the Aequator from D to C. Now if the <hi>Declination</hi> were equall to the latitude, then the magneticall wier should obserue and follow the facultie and peculiar vertue of the center of an <hi>operatiue</hi> and attractiue point. But reason &amp; experience teacheth, that it obserueth the whole body and masse, with all the externall limits of the Earth and Load-stone; the whole vertues and forces of both concurring,

But experience hath found the contrary, because the Declination will bee all one, bee the stone stronger or wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker. Moreouer a Loadstone armed with an Iron-Nose (as they tearme it) put vpon the Meridian in any latitude, will not lift vp a piece of iron more perpendicularly, then if it were naked and vncouered, although it will lift vp much greater and heauier waights; which experiments are sufficient to confirme our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion, that this Declination is caused only by the disponent and conuersiue vertue of this Terrestriall Globe.</p>

in our time: which cannot bee ascribed to the errour of the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, because it is not probable that the whole series should bee depraued according to this equality of number. Wherefore it must follow of necessity, that the North pole should bee mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued toward the verticall circle: which mystery not knowne of the Ancients for want of former obseruations, hath shewed it selfe to our times, being inriched not only with their, but our owne experiments.

Nothing is here of more moment then the motion of the Sea, by which the parts of the water by continuall ebbing and flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, suffer such a sensible change of Addition and Diminution, that no man can imagine how the parts of the Earth about the Center should alwayes bee equally counterpoyzed, but the waight on one side should bee predominant vnto the other, and so driue the Center from his former place.

                           <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his 1 booke <hi>de coelo</hi> makes 3 kindes of simple motions, out of which hee labours to deduce the number of simple bodies. The first is the motion from the center, such as is of Fire and Ayre, and all light bodies: the second to the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, such as is of Earth and Water; the third is round about the center or middle, which hee ascribes to the Heauens: so that if this ground were true, the Earth could challenge to it selfe no other then the right motion; whereby the parts of it being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from the whole, returne to it againe. But this opinion although popular and plausible, hath beene contradicted, as well by ancient Philosophers as moderne: for by long experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and diligent obseruation, they haue found the earth to bee endowed with a star-like vigour, whereby shee may, hauing all her parts vnited together by reason of her grauity vnto the Center, and her place made sure by her magneticall poles, moue naturally vpon her owne poles, at least if so bee shee claime no other motion. This opinion first blosomed (as farre as I can gather) in the Schoole of <hi>Pythagoras,</hi> was cherished by <hi>Hera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clides Ponticus,</hi> and <hi>Ecphantus,</hi> two famous <hi>Pythagoreans</hi>: to which afterward ioyned themselues <hi>Nicetus Syracusanus,</hi> and <hi>Aristarchus Samius</hi>; all which haue vndertaken to defend that the Earth moues circularly, and that this circumgyration of the Earth causeth the rising and setting of the Sunne, as well as of other starres, although in the manner they haue not expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed themselues alike, hauing inioyed as yet scarce the first dawn of knowledge. But all this while Philosophie contented her selfe with the acquaintance of a few choice friends, not daring to prostitute her treasures to popularity. But when it hapned in after times that shee was taught the language of the vulgar, and spake to the vnderstanding of each mechanicke, shee soone
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8020:48"/>
contracted some staines, and squared her selfe rather to please the most then the best. Thus the multitude as a vast torrent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uailed against the learned, and cast into exile the inuentions of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> which their ignorance was readier to censure then vnderstand. Yet were not the seeds of this Philosophy quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct, but as forgotten for a time; vntill there arose <hi>Copernicus,</hi> a man of incomparable wit, who quickned and reuiued it, to his euerlasting prayse and our profit: I would not here be mistaken, as though I strongly apprehend these grounds, and reiect all the principles of our <hi>Peripateticke</hi> Philosophie: I only inueigh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst their preiudicate ignorance, which ready to licke vp the dust vnder <hi>Aristotles</hi> feet with a supercilious looke contemne all other learning, as though no flowers of science could grow in another garden. I confesse this opinion of the Earths circular motion to bee subiect to many and great exceptions, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by strong and waighty arguments drawn probably from the booke of God, the touch-stone of sincere verity; yet I hold it too strongly fortified to be inuaded by popular arguments drawn from seeming sense, and bolstered vp with names and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For mine owne part, I confesse not absolute subscription to this opinion; yet could I not conueniently leaue it out, because hauing vndertaken to insert this Magneticall Tract; I would not willingly mangle it in any part, but shew it whole and intire to the view of the iudicious; who herein may vse their Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicall liberty, to imbrace or reiect what they please.

The third is a motion of <hi>Declination</hi> performed in an annuall reuolution; reflecting against the motion of the Center; for the Axis of the Earth is supposed to haue a <hi>conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible</hi> nature, whereas if it should remaine fixt, there would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare no inequality of day and night, <hi>Spring, Autumne, Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> or <hi>Winter:</hi> I will not here curiously distinguish the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; limits, and periods of these three motions, but leaue it to the skilfull Astronomer, to whom properly it appertaines: it is enough for mee to shew it probable that the Earth should challenge to it selfe a circular motion, in prosecution of which I shall labour chiefly to establish that first motion which is of the Terrestriall globe about her owne axis, which is the easiest both to beleeue and vnderstand. That I may the better expresse the grounds of this opinion, I will labour to proue these two points. 1 That this opinion is consonant to reason. 2 That it no way contradicts the sense of the <hi>Holy Scripture.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer assertion wee will againe diuide into 3 articles. 1 That the motion which wee seeke to establish in the Earth cannot with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much absurdity bee granted to the heauens.

First therefore finding the dayly rising and setting of the Sunne, Moone, and other Starres to arise from some motion, wee are to seeke out the true subiect of this motion. It is agreed vpon by all that this subiect must bee the <hi>Heauens,</hi> which are carryed in 24 houres from East to West, or the <hi>Earth</hi> which must moue in the same time from West to East.

But <hi>Ptolomie</hi> perceiuing this number to bee insufficient to satisfie his obseruations, was infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to adde a ninth to encrease the number. Yet this contented not <hi>Alphonsus,</hi> but hee must make vp tenne. And although this opinion preuailed a long time in the Schooles of <hi>Philosophers,</hi> as most exact and absolute; yet came it farre short to satisfie the search of two latter Astronomers, <hi>Clauius,</hi> and <hi>Maginus</hi>; who to adde something to Antiquity, haue found out another orbe, and so the whole tale is become eleuen: and much it is to bee feared that the big-swolne belly of this learned <hi>Ignorance,</hi> will beget more children to help the Mother, because all the former haue proued lame and impotent: God send her a safe deliuery. To returne to my purpose; all these orbs thus ranged and conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated in order, cannot but haue each of them a great and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary thicknesse and profundity: being to carry in them such huge and vast bodyes, as the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Starres,</hi> which are of themselues mighty Globes, for the most part greater then the Earth, as Philosophers haue found out by diuers Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticall instruments, and expressed in Tables. Also because a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Planetary Orbes wee shall finde them clouen into many partiall and lesser Orbes, as <hi>Epicycles</hi> and <hi>Excentrickes,</hi> the first of which must in reason surpasse the thicknesse of the <hi>Diameter</hi> of the Planet. The profundity of all these Orbes is measured by their Diameters, which wee shall find to surmount
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:8020:49" rendition="simple:additions"/>
each other in extraordinary proportion. For the Diameter of the Earth is 1718 <hi>German</hi> miles. The greatest distance or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longation of the <hi>Moone</hi> being new, 65 semi-diameters of the Earth; the least is 55 semi-diameters. The greater elongation of the Moone in the middle space is 68; the least 52 semi-dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meters of the Earth. Notwithstanding it is very probable, that the Orbe of the Moone is yet of more thicknesse and profun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. To passe ouer <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Mercurie,</hi> and come to the <hi>Sunne,</hi> wee shall find his distances from the Earth in his greatest <hi>Excentricity</hi> to bee 1142 semi-diameters of the Earth. <hi>Mars, Iupiter,</hi> and <hi>Saturne,</hi> are yet farther off from the Earth, and their Orbes endowed with a greater treasure of thicknesse. The distance of the <hi>Firmament</hi> wherein are placed the fixt Starres, is by the best Mathematicians thought incomprehensible, and not measurable by mans industrie: in so much that <hi>Aristotle</hi> holds the Earth no other then as a point, if it bee compared with the eighth Spheare, which hee supposed to bee the highest and first Moueable. To let passe the <hi>ninth</hi> Spheare; the <hi>tenth,</hi> which was vulgarly thought the first Moueable, if it bee valued according to the proportion of the rest, would haue his conuexe <hi>superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> moued so fast in one houre, that it would ouercome so much space as 3000 greater <hi>circles</hi> of the <hi>Terrestriall Globe</hi>; for as much as in the conuexe <hi>superficies</hi> of the starry Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it would containe more then 1800.

And if this motion seeme so swift, that it could hardly haue credit among ordinary capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; what should wee thinke of this motion, which is imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned infinitely swifter? If <hi>Ptolomie</hi> feared lest the Globe of the Earth should be dissolued and shattered in pieces by a far slower motion; of what should wee imagine the heauens to be made, which can suffer so portentous and incogitable a whirling? Here the common Philosopher stands astonished, and rather then hee will be thought to know nothing, hee will say any thing: why (saith he) should wee not beleeue it? sith the Heauens in their motion find no <hi>Resistance,</hi> whereas all other bodies are slacked by the <hi>medium</hi> or Aire by which they are to moue. If in the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens were any such <hi>let</hi> or hinderance, it would bee either in the <hi>Agent</hi> or Mouer; or in the <hi>Patient</hi> or body moued: Not in the mouer, because (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> hath taught) the Heauens are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued or turned round by an <hi>Angell,</hi> or <hi>Intelligence,</hi> fixed to his Orbe, of a <hi>spirituall</hi> and immateriall substance, which in a body meetes no opposition. Not in the body moued: because of it's owne Nature it is prone and inclinable to this motion. But this reason is like a reed that hurts his hand that leanes on it: for first, what <hi>indigence</hi> or necessity in Nature is obserued so great, to bee the father of such Intelligences? What serious iudgment can euer imagine the Angels to bee like gally-slaues chained fast
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:8020:50"/>
to their gallies, or turne-spit-dogs labouring in their wheeles? To what vse shall they serue? not to <hi>stirre</hi> vp and beginne the motion; for why should we debarre the Heauens from the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiledge ofall other Bodies farre lesse excellent, whose motions challenge no other cause or beginning then their owne forme and nature: Not to <hi>Regulate</hi> and confine this motion; for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which beginnes any action or motion, is able of her selfe to set limits and bounds vnto it, without the helpe of any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall agent. Finally not to continue this motion; for as wee are taught in our <hi>Philosophie,</hi> Euery <hi>Naturall Agent,</hi> if it bee not hindered, still acts to the vttermost of his power, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore needes no externall coadiutor to continue his action: for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise we might suppose the Heauens to grow weary and faint in their intended course. Secondly, whereas they say there can bee no <hi>Resistence</hi> in the body moued, they contradict their owne grounds: for it is agreed by all, that the higher Orbs doe turne and wrest about the lower: I would willingly aske, by what kinde of action, either by a <hi>vertuall</hi> influence or emana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or els by a <hi>corporall</hi> touch and application: The former is improbable, and (as farre as I can gather) not auuouched by any; and were it so, it would seeme ridiculous; for why should wee rather ascribe this effect to an vnknowne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of an externall body, then to the vigour of his owne <hi>forme</hi> and <hi>nature.</hi> For if one orbe in this sort can moue another, why could it not moue it selfe, being more present to it selfe then any other; If they say by a <hi>corporall</hi> application of bodies and their parts. I see not how they can auoid this <hi>Renitencie</hi> and reaction, which alwayes doth suppose some resistence: for how can one solide and hard body bee imagined to heaue and push another forward without some reluctancy in the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent? because the inferiour Orbe hauing of it selfe a proper mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this must needes be violent, as supposing a forcing &amp; wre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting of Nature from her proper course, whereof it is not hard to shew a sensible demonstration; because the Orbe naturally directed one way, is turned and directed another way at the same time: which both motions concurring in the same body, must needes offer violence one to the other. Moreouer the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity

from <hi>corruptible</hi> qualities granted to the Heauens, which is the ground of this opinion; hath beene muh talked of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Aristoteleans</hi>
                              <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but neuer warranted by any certaine demonstration: wee see (say these Philosophers) the Heauens to haue remained since the beginning of the World, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny sensible alteration and change: and therefore must all the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary</hi> and corruptible qualities bee excluded. To disproue this, I need goe no farther then the last <hi>Comet,</hi> which Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians by the <hi>parallax</hi> found to bee in the heauens. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as otherwise they seeke a sensible alteration in other parts, they deceiue themselues: for as in the earth whereon wee dwell, howeuer the parts interchangeably corrupt and ingender dayly, yet the whole Globe will apparantly remaine the same, keeping it's integrity: so may it happen to many of the superiour Globes, whose parts dayly corrupted and renewed againe (although, for the great distance, to vs insensible) the whole Globe remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth still perfect in his perfect <hi>Sphericity.</hi> I cease any further to inuade anothers Prouince, and therefore descend to a second argument, to proue this extraordinary, violent, and swift mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the heauens to bee improbable. It is ordinarily obserued in other Orbes of the heauens, that the higher the Orbe is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, the motion is slower; as for example, the Spheare of the Moone, which is next the Earth, is carried about in 27 dayes. <hi>Mercury</hi> and <hi>Venus</hi> are slow enough in their course, as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in 80 dayes, the latter in 9 moneths: the <hi>Sunne</hi> in a yeere; <hi>Mars</hi> in 2 yeeres; <hi>Iupiter</hi> in 12; <hi>Saturne</hi> in 30. Also those A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomers which giue the <hi>fixt</hi> starres a motion, would haue them to finish their course, according to <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> in 36000: but if wee will beleeue <hi>Copernicus,</hi> in 25816 yeeres: so that the higher and greater the circles be, so much slower will be the motion: what iniury were it then to the concord and harmony of Nature, to impose vpon the highest Orbe of all, such an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>measurable strange motion, which might strike the most <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To these may bee added other Arguments in <hi>Copernicus,</hi> which albeit they be not demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue, will make the matter more probable. First, that Nature in all things is a compendious and short worker, and vseth not
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:8020:51"/>
many helpes for such thinges as may bee performed by fewer: and therefore need wee not to vse the helpe of so many Orbes and concamerations to square our obseruations, which will find more steady footing in this one ground once granted, of the Earth's <hi>circular</hi> motion: Secondly it will seeme more conso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and agreeable to Nature, that the highest and vttermost Spheare of all, which bounds and engirts in all the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, should rest quiet and vnmoueable, then to suffer such an intollerable motion, as might endanger the whole Fabricke. Lastly, I may adde this one, that this <hi>diurnall</hi> motion, granted to the first Moueable, can in my iudgement hardly stand with the regularity of heauenly Bodies, if wee expresse it no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise then the ordinary sort of Astronomers. For a regular motion is defined, to bee that whereby in equall times a body is moued through equall places. But this <hi>Diurnall</hi> motion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued from the first Moueable, concurring with the <hi>Sunnes</hi> an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall motion, will exclude this equality. For first it is granted, that the Sunne in his motion from the <hi>Aequator,</hi> to the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picke,</hi> according to sense, runnes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, they must grant that these pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallells are diminished, and grow lesse and lesse toward the <hi>Tropicke,</hi> from the <hi>Aequator.</hi> Thirdly, that (as wee haue fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shewed) of two bodies mouing in the same time on the same center, that should moue faster, which is greater: so one body mouing in diuerse vnequall circles, in equall time, it must of necessity follow that it must needes moue faster, in that which is greater: here wee may conclude, he moues faster in the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator,</hi> then in the <hi>Tropicke,</hi> because in the one hee is carryed in a greater parallell, in the other a lesse, and yet in the same pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of time, as wee may see in this Figure following. Let the <hi>Sunne</hi> bee in the point of the Eclipticke A, it is manifest that he will sensibly moue for that day in the parallell AP. Then let him bee moued by his periodicke motion, into the point of the Eclipticke B, it will for that moment moue in the

parallell IBO. Last of all, let it bee in the point of the Aequator C. his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell will bee HCL. It is manifest out of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer grounds, that he will be moued slowest in AP. Faster in IO. Fastest of all in HCL. Which swiftnesse and slownesse in the Suns motion makes it irregular. Some haue thought to salue this by saying that this motion is <hi>Regular</hi> because in equall time, the Sunne goes <hi>proportionall,</hi> not <hi>equall</hi> spaces, which <hi>Aguillonius</hi> holds in his <hi>Opti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hitherto haue wee shewed that this <hi>Diurnall</hi> motion cannot without some absurdity bee granted to the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens: in the next place we are to shew, that it no way can crosse the Naturall disposition of the <hi>Earth</hi> it selfe, which wee shall demonstrate in this manner. If this circular motion should crosse the disposition of the Earthly Globe, it would happen either immediatly in respect of the meere Nature, which the <hi>Logicians</hi> call <hi>à priore</hi>; or els in regard of certaine properties, which follow necessarily the Nature of it, which they terme <hi>à posteriori.</hi> If they say it happens <hi>à priori</hi> in regard of the meere Nature<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they must necessarily haue recourse to the <hi>proprieties</hi> and accidents for a demonstration: For the Internall formes of all things being in themselues insensible, cannot be discouered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs but by their externall proprieties<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But if probable conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture may here find any place, I see no reason why the earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found to bee of a magneticall temper, should not challenge

At length wee will proue that this orbicular motion giuen vnto the Earth, cannot ouerthrow or thwart any other motion of the Earth: for if this were so, it would happen for one of these two respects; Either because the Earth hath some motion or other contrary to this; or els because diuers motions cannot bee in the Earth. The first cannot be true, for that wee haue spoken before; because the right mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they finde in the Earth, cannot bee iudged contrary to the

                              <hi>Sphericall</hi>; neither can the later bee admitted as an vndoubted truth; for howsoeuer <hi>Aristotle</hi> sets it downe for an Axiome, that <hi>one simple body hath but one simple motion,</hi> yet being abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely vnderstood without any limitation, will bee found by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience false: for it is manifest out of the experiment of the new <hi>Perspicils,</hi> that the Bodies of the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter,</hi> simple in nature, (if wee beleeue <hi>Aristoteleans</hi>) haue at least a double motion, the one vpon their owne Poles lesse then <hi>Diurnall,</hi> the other of their <hi>Centers,</hi> which are moued from the West vnto the East, vpon other Poles familiarly knowne vnto Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers.

First, because these two motions of the <hi>Sunne</hi> and <hi>Iupiter</hi> will easily bee proued to bee <hi>naturall</hi> and without violence, or restraint: Secondly, because in this ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer they suppose the Heauens to bee cut and diuided into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse <hi>Orbes, Sections,</hi> and <hi>Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the right motion of the parts ioyning to the whole, and the Circular motion: also the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular motion of a Planet about his owne Axell, and the Circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar motion it selfe about the Earth, are found to bee diuerse kindes, and therefore no way incompatible in the same subiect. Moreouer what infallible argument can perswade vs, that the Globe of the Earth is a meere simple Body, such as <hi>Aristotle</hi> describes vnto vs in his Philosophie? Either this imaginary simplicitie must bee sought in the <hi>Reall Existence</hi> of the Earth, or els in our <hi>mentall Abstraction.</hi> The former they cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerre, because not only the Elements themselues, by their owne confession, are impure and corrupted: But the whole Globe of the Earth seemes to consist of diuerse mixtures, and Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneall bodies, which apparantly exclude such simplicity If

they would haue it rather to consist in the Abstraction or se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the minde, which may diuide and distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the true nature of the Earth, and his Accidentall Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; I shall not contradict: although it seeme <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The other magneticall, wherein all other bodies are vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in one <hi>Magneticall</hi> forme of the Earth. In which sort the whole Globe of the Earth may bee termed a <hi>Homogeneall</hi> sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance; for howsoeuer the matter and the Elements whereof it consists<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seeme Heterogeneall and diuerse one from the other; yet since in this Magneticall Nature, there is a Harmony and Communion, well wee may call it a Homogenity of the Forme and Nature; not of the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Quantity,</hi> as common Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers commonly vse the word: So that euery part or Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof this Terrestriall Spheare is compounded, may claime his owne motion, and properly; yet all conspiring in one vniuersall forme of a Sphericall Body, may notwithstanding be turned round with a Sphericall motion. In the last place wee are to proue that this Circular motion granted vnto the Earth, can no way oppose or indanger the naturall <hi>site</hi> or position of the Earth: If the situation or position were feared to bee chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, it must needes happen one of these wayes; either that the <hi>Center</hi> of the Earth should bee moued out of his place: or that the <hi>parts</hi> should bee separated &amp; distracted one from the other; or that the <hi>Poles</hi> should be changed and altered: The first can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not touch our assertion; because in this place wee affirme not, that the center of the Globe is moued out of his place; but that the whole Earth in the same place is turned round vpon her owne Center. For the opinion of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> which holdes the Center of the Earth to moue round about the earth, wee shall
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:8020:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
censure in our next Chapter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> In the second place, the parts of the Earth by this motion cannot bee separated or disunited one from the other: first, because all the parts are vnited to the whole by their naturall grauity; that if by chance they should bee separated, they would naturally returne backe vnto their owne place. Secondly, this motion is supposed <hi>Naturall</hi> &amp; not <hi>violent,</hi> which in so great and massie a Body, can make no sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Alteration. Lastly, the Poles of the Earth by this meanes, cannot bee moued out of their places; because by a certaine <hi>Magneticall verticity</hi> (as wee haue formerly shewed) the same Poles of the Earth alwayes naturally respect the same points of the Heauens, as if they were bound vnto two firme Pillars indissoluble. Hitherto hauing proued the <hi>Circular</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earth; neither to bee giuen to the Heauens without some absurdity, and yet no way to contradict or oppose the Nature of the Terrestriall Globe; wee are in the third place to examine the reasons vsually vrged against this Assertion. The first reason is drawne from <hi>sense.</hi> If there were any such <hi>Spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> motion (say they) how comes it to passe, that it cannot of vs bee perceiued? an Argument worthy such Philosophers, as measure all rather by seeming sense, then <hi>Demonstratiue</hi> reason; who cannot obserue on the sea in a calme, that the ship wherein hee is carried will seeme to rest, or at least to moue slowly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the clifts and shores to moue vnto the opposite part? What then should wee thinke of the motion of the whole Terrestriall Globe? which hath lesse cause to bee percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, then that of a ship? The Bulke of a ship in respect of the Earth is small and of no quantity; the other being huge and massie: The motion of the ship meerely violent, inforced by the windes; of the Earth naturall and vniforme, stirred vp of his proper and naturall inclination, so that if any such motion be in the earth, it were impossible to bee perceiued by sense: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, they vrge against vs, that in <hi>Homogeneall</hi> Bodies, there is the same motion of the <hi>whole,</hi> and all the <hi>parts</hi>: But euery part of the Earth (as experience teacheth) is moued downe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward toward the Center, and therefore the whole can haue no other motion: To this obiection wee haue partly answered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:8020:55"/>
yet to giue further satisfaction, wee will adde something more: It is one thing to speake of the <hi>whole</hi> Terrestriall Globe and Spheare; another of the seuerall <hi>parts</hi> and Elements where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it consists: If the whole Spheare bee vnderstood, wee ascribe vnto it no other motion but the circular, which wee here labor to establish. The parts, whereof this Terrestriall Spheare consists, may bee considered two wayes; either as they are <hi>vnited</hi> in the whole by a Magneticall forme, or <hi>disioyned</hi> and taken by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues: In the former the parts of the Earth are supposed to moue in the same motion, by which the whole Spheare of the Earth is moued; because the <hi>whole</hi> and all the <hi>parts</hi> taken together, are the same, and subiect to the same circular reuolution. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding this, any <hi>part</hi> seuerall and disioyned from the whole, hath a right motion downeward toward the Center, by which it returnes to its true naturall vnion. This inclination of the parts agrees not with the whole Earth, neither vnto any part vnited and conglobated to the whole; but onely to a part separated from his place; so that the whole, may notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in his place inioy a circular motion. Now to come more neerely home vnto their Arguments drawne from the <hi>Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneity</hi> of the Earth, wee answer as before, that there is a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold <hi>Homogeneity</hi>: The one of the <hi>matter</hi> and quantity; the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the <hi>Magneticall forme</hi> and Nature of the former: wee may conclude out of the right motion of all the parts, the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the whole, so wee vnderstand it in a good sense: first that euery part is here to bee vnderstood, not in, but out of his proper place: Secondly, that by the <hi>whole,</hi> wee ought not to vnderstand the whole Globe with all his parts, conformed in one Sphericall frame; but all the parts <hi>indefinitely</hi> taken; for if wee should vnderstand of the whole Globe, their Argument will in no way hold true: If according to the later, wee might well grant them their Conclusion, yet can it not oppugne our Assertion: Because it will follow out of the Naturall inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of euery part, that all the parts seuerally taken, haue such a disposition of returning to the Earth, being separated there from: Yet will not this by any necessary inference bee proued to agree to the whole Globe of the Earth; but rather will it
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:8020:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
follow contrarywise, that the whole Spheare of the Earth is moued circularly, and therefore euery part with, and in it, is moued with the whole in the same motion. A third argument which is thought greater then all the other, is drawne from two experiments: The first is, that a <hi>stone</hi> or <hi>Bullet</hi> let fall from a higher place to the ground, will perpendicularly descend to the point of the Earth right vnder: Secondly, that two <hi>Bullets</hi> imagined to bee of equall weight and matter, being dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from equall pieces of ordinance, with the like quantity of powder, the one towards the East, the other towards the West, will reach an equall distance in the Earth; both which would seeme impossible if wee grant this supposition of the Earths circular reuolution. For in the former case, the Earth sliding away swiftly during the fall of the stone, would change the point marked out for another: And in the second, for the like cause, the Bullet shot towards the East, being preuented by the swiftnesse of the Earth's motion, carrying along with it the Ordinance out of which it proceeded, should returne backe ouer the shooters-head; and contrarywise that Bullet shot to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the West, besides his owne motion, by the motion of the Earth the other way, should bee carryed so much farther, as the Earth is remoued from the place where it was first dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged: Both which experiments seeme to crosse this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumgyration of the Terrestriall Globe, which our magneticall Cosmographers labour to confirme: But with them to giue an answer to these and the like experiments, wee must distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish the parts of the Earth into three sorts; some are hard and solide parts, adioyned to the Globe, as <hi>stones, mineralls,</hi> &amp; what else in the bowels of the Earth is vnited to it, or at least necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily adherent to the outward face of it. Some other parts there are of a thinne and fluid substance, as the Aire and other va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours in it, deriued from the Earth; A third sort there are of such parts as being in themselues solide, are notwithstanding by some violence separated from the solide globe, as <hi>stones</hi> cast into the Aire; <hi>Arrowes, Bullets,</hi> and such like, discharged from the hand or Engine: For the two former wee may easily ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine them carried with the same circular motion, which we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:8020:56"/>
vnto the <hi>whole,</hi> being no other then the parts of it depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from the whole masse: For the third sort (whereof con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists the difficulty) wee cannot imagine them so moued round, as if they were wholly separated from the Communion of the Earthly Spheare; for howsoeuer there seemes a separation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>matter</hi> and quantity, yet retaine they the same mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall inclination to the whole masse, as if they were vnited to it; and therefore such solide parts are moued with the same vniforme and naturall motion wherewith the Earth it selfe is turned; so that in solide bodyes so separated from the superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Earth, of an Arrow or Bullets shot, wee must ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a twofold motion: The one <hi>Naturall</hi> &amp; vniforme, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are moued as homogeneall parts according to the reuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the whole Spheare: The other <hi>violent</hi> by force im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed from the Agent: The right motion proceeding from the strength of the shooter, cannot crosse or hinder the Naturall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the one being right, and the other circular, admit no such proportion, as that one should hinder or further the other: Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can these motions well be tearmed contrary or opposite, which are in diuers kindes: To explaine this matter farther, we

Globe of the earth, so must wee imagine the part of it marked out by the right line OQ to bee carried round with an vnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Reuolution. Wherefore if any heauy body should bee placed in the Line OQ; as for example P, it will fall downe toward the center by the shortest way in the same line OQ: which motion downewards towards the center, can neither bee <hi>hindered</hi> by the circular motion of the Earth, nor yet <hi>Mixt</hi> or compounded with it: It cannot bee hindred: because (as wee haue shewed) a Right motion and a circular being not in the same kind, cannot properly bee reputed contrary: Neither for the same cause can they bee mixt or compounded: Wherefore this motion will be no other then one simple and Right motion, neuer varying from the Line OQ: which being once vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, it is no hard thing to imagine a Bullet or stone forced by equall strength from Q towards L, and from Q. to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the point M, to obserue alwayes a like distance notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the Earth's cir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hauing hitherto shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Sphericall motion of the Earth to bee possible, and no way to contradict Nature, wee are in the next place to shew it to bee no way opposite to the sense of holy Scripture.

To these haue associated themselues another sort, more to bee regarded, as more learned; the <hi>Critickes</hi> (I meane) of our Age, who like <hi>Popes</hi> or <hi>Dictatours,</hi> haue taken vpon them an Vniuersall authority to censure all which they neuer vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood.

To seeke for a determination of a <hi>Cosmographicall</hi> doubt in the Grammaticall resolution of two or three <hi>Hebrew</hi> wordes, (which some haue gone about) were to neglect the kernell, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:8020:57"/>
make a banquet on the shells. But howsoeuer, we hope to make it appeare, that the Scripture vnderstood as it ought to bee, is so farre from fauouring their opinion, that the words them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues can hardly admit of such a sense, as they would fasten on them. But ere wee descend to the examination of particular places of holy Scriptures alleaged in their behalfe, wee will shew this opinion to bee much different from that of <hi>Coperni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> as somewhat more moderate, and able to suffer an easier re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement with the holy Text. For the places alleaged of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Scripture, which seeme to oppose our Assertion, either seeme to proue the <hi>circular</hi> motion of the Heauens, or the <hi>rest,</hi> and stability of the Earth. But this opinion holding a Mediocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty betwixt both, neither takes away the motion from the <hi>Heauens,</hi> neither oppugnes such a Rest or quietnesse in the <hi>Earth,</hi> as the Scriptures vnderstand. For first, albeit wee take away from the Heauens the <hi>diurnall</hi> motion, and giue it to the Earth: yet we grant to the heauenly Orbes their seuerall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, allowing no part of it to bee absolutely voide of motion, Secondly, wee must vnderstand this in a fourefold sense; as op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to foure kindes of Motions. First to the progressiue Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Center</hi> of the Terrestriall globe from place to place. Secondly, to the <hi>separation</hi> or dissolution of the parts one from the other, by which the Globe may loose his integrity. Thirdly to the <hi>Translocation</hi> of the Poles, whereby the Poles inclining to one side or another, may bee imagined to change their posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Fourthly, to the <hi>Diurnall</hi> Motion. In the first sense wee giue a Rest and stability to the Earth, because the Earth, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer moueable, wee place in the Center of the world, as wee shall proue in the next Chapter. In the second sense we also grant it; because all the parts of the Earth being of a heauy nature, fall naturally downewards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and vnite themselues vnto the whole, to decline such a dissolution: In the third acception wee likewise allow such a stability: because the Poles of the Earth (as wee haue shewed) by their magneticall inclination, alwayes respect the same points in the heauens, and can from thence by no meanes remooue themselues. Only in the fourth and last sense wee exclude a Rest, allowing onely a diurnall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolution from West to East in twenty foure houres. The

Another reason which I take to bee stronger then the former, some haue taken out of the 19 Psalme; where speaking of the <hi>Sunne,</hi> hee vses these words. <hi>In them hath hee set a Tabernacle for the Sunne.</hi> 5 <hi>Which is as a bridegroome comming out of his chamber<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyceth as a giant to runne his course</hi>: 6 <hi>His going forth is from the end of the Heauens; and his circuite vnto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.</hi> Out of which words the Heauens should seeme to challenge the motion, which wee haue giuen vnto the Earth. To this we answer two wayes: First, that although this may oppugne <hi>Copernicus</hi> his opinion, that the Sunne standeth still in the middest as the center of the World; yet may it well stand with our Assertion, who allow the Sunne his seuerall motion in the <hi>Eclipticke</hi>: whether those words of the Psalme bee to bee vnderstood of the Sunnes <hi>Diur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> or <hi>Periodicke</hi> Motion, is not so soone decided: the Scripture not specifying expressely either. 2 we may answer with the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicâns</hi>; That the Holy Ghost in these or the like places speakes <gap reason="foreign">

                        <p>It might seeme a hard and almost impossible taske for any man to reconcile that which hath beene spoken in the former Chapter concerning the <hi>Earths circular Reuolution,</hi> with the grounds of common Geographers, which hold the <hi>Terrestriall Globe</hi> to bee setled and fixed in the Center of the world. The reason is; because such as hold the circular motion of the Earth, (whereof the chiefe is <hi>Copernicus</hi>) would haue the <hi>Sun</hi> to stand still, as the fixt Center of the <hi>Vniuerse,</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> to moue round about him betwixt <hi>Mars</hi> and <hi>Venus,</hi> which seemes cleane opposite to the former opinion. I must confesse that <hi>Copernicus</hi>
                           <pb n="98" facs="tcp:8020:59"/>
his opinion entirely taken and vnderstood, standeth altogether opposite to these our grounds: yet may that motion of the <hi>Earth</hi> which we haue established in the former Chapter (for ought I yet know) bee well reconciled with their opinion, which hold the Earth to bee the Center of the world. For the circular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolution wee gaue to the Terrestriall Globe, was not a motion of the <hi>Center</hi> of it, from one place to another, as that of the Starres which moue round about the Earth; but rather a turning of it selfe in its owne place, vpon her owne Poles and Axell-tree, in such sort as the wheele of a mill, or such a like engin fixt in one place is turned vpon his owne Axell: So that the motion wee there vnderstood was only the <hi>Diurnall</hi> motion of 24 houres, making the Day and Night. The other two motions mentioned by <hi>Copernicus,</hi> may be found out in the Heauens, and left to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomers.</hi> The reasons why I entirely embrace not <hi>Copernicus</hi> his opinion, are chiefely two. First, because it seemes too harsh and dissonant in nature, to make one and the selfe-same body subiect to so many motions, especially such as by common Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers is denied all motion. Secondly, because the other mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions granted to the Earth must needs suppose it to bee placed out of the Center of the world; the contrary of which we shall in this Chapter, God willing, sufficiently demonstrate. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore most called in question, and most likely to bee found in the Earth rather then in the Heauen, is the Diurnall Reuolution performed in 24 houres from the West to East: which (as we haue proued) being giuen to the Heauens would be farre swifter then nature can well suffer: wherefore with more probability may this motion bee taken from the heauens, and giuen vnto the Earth: The other without any absurdity at all may be granted in the Heauens: Sith no repugnancy is found in nature, but that euery heauenly body may be furnished with some motion: and therefore <hi>Copernicus</hi> might haue granted the <hi>Sun</hi> and fixed Starres their seuerall motions as well as the rest, which would haue seemed farre more probable then to haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed the Earth with a Triplicity of motion.

                           </argument>
                           <p>To vnderstand aright this proposition, wee must consider that a <hi>Center</hi> may be taken two manner of wayes: either <hi>Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> or <hi>Optically</hi>: In Geometry it is taken for an imaginary point, conceiued in a magnitude deuoyde of all quantity, yet bounding and termining all Magnitudes: <hi>Optically</hi> it is vsually taken for a small and insensible Magnitude; because to the fight it may seeme no other then a <hi>Point</hi>; In which last sense we may call the Earth the Center: For although the <hi>Earthly Spheare</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with a great and massie substance, yet (as we shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after demonstrate) in respect of the Firmament this greatnesse would vanish into nothing. For if a man standing in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment should behold it, it would seeme no other then as a small point. This being declared, wee will produce these reasons to proue the Earth to be the Center of the Vniuerse. The Center, I say, not of all heauenly motions (for some Starres are moued vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own Center) but of the whole heauenly machine being collectiuely taken as one Body The first argument is of <hi>Aristotle,</hi> taken from the grauity or naturall inclination of all heauy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to the Center. The Earth (saith he) being a heauy &amp; massie body, must needs seeke the lowest place, which is farthest off from the Heauens. But this can be no other then the Center or middest point of the whole world. Which argument by others is more subtily vrged in this manner. Suppose the whole masse of the Earth were cut and diuided into many parts, equall the one to the other, of the same waight and figure: which parts so diuided were placed in diuers places vnder the concaue Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies of the Moone, that they might be freely left to themselues to moue according to their naturall inclinations: It is most cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine that all their parts being of the same nature, waight, quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, and figure, would descend with the same motion, &amp; in the same equall time, to the same place; which could in no wise hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, except they should concurre in the Center of the world. But this reason, for ought I vnderstand, is only probable, and not backt with any necessary demonstration. For it proues not
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:8020:60"/>
thing else but the Earth to bee the Center of all earthie and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy bodies, and not to bee absolutely placed in the exact middle of the world. Another reason not much vnlike the former, is drawne by some from a finall cause, and the naturall harmony of the parts of the world, one with the other: The Earth (say they) is of all other bodyes, the most vile, and sordid: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is agreeable to nature, that it should be placed in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, equally distant from each part of the Heauens, that one part might not seeme to complaine of this vnpleasing vicinity more then another: But this reason takes as granted to matters, as yet not decided. First, that the Earth, amongst all other bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyes, is most vile and sordid, depending on the ground of Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pateticks, that the heauenly bodies suffer no corruption, a thing sooner spoken then proued. Secondly that pure and impure bodies, the most excellent and most vile in nature, are alwayes most distant, as in nature, so in place: which is a peremptory as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion without ground. A third reason more probable then the former, is drawne from the apparences of Starres aboue the Horizon: It is manifest that the Starres aboue the Horizon appeare alwayes to bee of one, and the selfe-same magnitude, and quantity, whether in the verticall point, or in the East, or the West, or any other place: whence we may collect that they differ equally in distance from the Earth, and by consequence the Earth is seated in the middle of the world: for if it were otherwise, that the Starres in some place should bee neerer, in other farther of<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>, they would some-where seeme greater, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where lesser, according to the grounds of the Opticks. This reason, howsoeuer popular, seemes to admit a two-fold ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception. First, because it implies that a man standing on the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the Earth is equally distant from all places and parts of the Heauens, whereas the heauens in the Horizon are farther distant, by reason of a whole semidiameter of the earth inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed. Secondly, all Starres arising in the East, or setting in the West, ordinarily seeme greater then in the Verticall point, by reason of vapours ascending and interposed. Whence wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not well gather the Earth to bee seated in the middest from the like apparence of the Starres when experience teacheth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                              <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:8020:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that they seeme not alwayes of the like magnitude. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the first, we answer that the Semidiameter of the earth interposed betwixt the Superficies and Center, is in it selfe greater. But this (as wee shall proue) in respect of the Heauens is so little, that the sense cannot gather any difference in obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation of the Starres, but that they should alwayes appeare of the like magnitude. Concerning the second, wee must needs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that vapours ascending about the Horizon by an Opticall Refraction, make the Starres seeme greater then other wise they would doe. But the reason may bee vnderstood in this sort: that whether a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>an be placed in the same Horizon where the Sunne is when hee riseth, or vnder that Horizon where the Sunne is now, vnder his Meridian, or vnder that horizon where hee is setting, hee will appeare to bee of one and the selfe-same greatnesse without any sensible difference. Whereas therefore they speake of the appearance of Starres, they would haue them taken as abstracted from all impediments of sight or interposed vapours, and so the reason may obtaine her force. The fourth reason why the earth should bee seated in the midst, alleaged by <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> and others, is this: wheresoeuer any man stands on the Surface of the Earth, six signes of the Zodiacke will shew themselues, and the other six signes will lye hid; and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence halfe the heauens will appeare, the other halfe will bee vnder; which is an euident reason that the Earth is in the midst, for otherwise it could not so happen. The former is confirmed by <hi>Ptolomie, Alphraganus,</hi> and the best Astronomers: the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence may bee inferred out of naturall reason. This argument will sufficiently hold vpon this supposition mentioned before, and to bee proued hereafter: That the Earth hauing no sensible magnitude in respect of the Firmament, no sensible difference can shew it selfe betwixt the <hi>Sensible,</hi> and the <hi>Rationall</hi> Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon. Besides these reasons, which make the matter more then probable: others are produced by <hi>Ptolomie</hi> demonstratiue, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ot admitting any euident or probable exception or euasion. The first is this; If the Earth bee placed out of the Center of the world, it must haue of necessity one of these three Sites or positions: Either it must be in the plaine of the Equinoctiall: or
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:8020:61"/>
at least it must bee placed, not onely without the plaine of the Equinoctiall, but without the Axell-tree: That is, to expresse it plainer; It must either bee placed beside the Axell-tree, yet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually distant from both the Poles; or else it must bee on the Axell-tree, and so consequently neerer to one Pole then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: or thirdly, it must needs be beside the Axell-tree, yet nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer to one Pole then another. If the first position were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, these absurdities would of necessity follow. First, that in a right Spheare there would happen no Equinoctiall, but onely in that Horizon which passeth by the Center of the world: for example sake; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>et there be imagined a Spheare, BDCE, whose
<figure/>
Center is A: let the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor bee DE: the Axel-tree of the world BC: and let the Earth bee in F, the right Horizon HG not passing by the Center of the world A: which shall bee parallell to the Axis BC: since the Equator cuts the Horizon in right angles; It is most manifest that not only the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, but other parallells of the same will bee vnequally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided of the Horizon: for as much as it passeth not by the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or the Poles of the world: wherefore it must needs follow, that the dayes must continually be vnequall to the nights: which contradicts all experience; because in a right Spheare the dayes are alwayes found to bee equall to the nights. Secondly, out of this position it would follow, that no man in a right Spheare
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:8020:61"/>
should behold the halfe or hemispheare of the heauens, but ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a greater or lesser part, as may be demonstrated out of the same Diagramme, whereas sense can testifie that six signes of the Zodiacke are alwayes conspicuous aboue our Horizon, and the other six alwayes hid: only excepting that Hor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>zon which passeth by the Center of the Earth, wherein the Mediety of Heauen is conspicuous. Thirdly, the same Starres in a cleere aire should not alwaies seeme of the same magnitude; for if the earth be placed in the Equinoctiall plaine, and beside the Axis of the world toward the Zenith or Meridian; the Starres which are in the Meridian will appeare greater then in the East or West, because they are neerer. But if it bee placed neere the Nadir or midnight point, they will appeare greater in the East or West, then in the Meridian: if it should bee placed towards the East or West, the Starres would either seeme greater in the East then in the West, or contrarywise, greater in the West then the East: all which plainely contradicts experience. Moreouer it would hence follow out of this last, that the fore-noone would not be equall to the after-noone, for as much as the Meridian circle passeth by our verticall point, which in this case cannot bee in the middle of the hemispheare, but will decline more, either to the East or the West. Fourthly, it must needs follow that in an oblique Spheare, either there will bee no Equinoctiall at all, or at least, if there were any, it would not be in the midst betwixt the two Solstices of Summer and Winter; which is against all common experience. To explaine which assertion, let there be a Spheare ABCD, whose Center shall bee E: wherein wee will conceiue the equatour to be BD: the two Tropicks IL, and XH: the Axell-tree of the world AC: Now if the Earth should be placed in the plaine of the equatour, out of the Axis of the world, as in F let there first be an oblique Horizon ZFY, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting all the parallells into vnequall parts, and the Axis in those parallells which are without: it is manifest that in the said Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon there will bee no Equinoctiall; because the Horizon e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually diuides in two halfes only that parallell which is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by P, which neuerthelesse the Sunne neuer comes vnto, as neuer going beyond the Tropicke XH: Let there bee another
<figure>
                                 <pb n="104" facs="tcp:8020:62"/>
                              </figure>
oblique Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon OFM cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Axell AC within the said paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels in N: It is manifest by reason, that there will hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pen an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall in the said Horizon when the Sun shall describe the parallell by N: because this parallell is by the Horizon diuided into two equall partes. But this can in no wise happen in a middle space and time betwixt the two Solstices, for as much as the Equator only is equally distant and remoued from either Solstice. It is also manifest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Sunne residing in BD the equator, there can bee no equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall, but either after or before: which is absurd and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to obseruation. Fiftly, it will bee inferred out of these grounds, that no Horizon shall diuide the Heauens into two equall parts besides that which concurres with the equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall circle, as BD, and such as are drawne by BD. Wherefore all people should not behold the one halfe of the heauens. Sixt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, out of this opinion would necessarily bee concluded, that the excesse of the greatest and longest day aboue the equinoctiall day, should not bee equalized by the defect of the shortest day, by how much it is exceeded by the equinoctiall day: which is against all common experience; the consequence shall appeare by demonstration. Suppose A to be the Articke Pole: then will PG bee the excesse of the longest day XP aboue XG the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall day. But KQ is the defect wherein the shortest day
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:8020:62"/>
IQ, is exceeded of the Equinoctiall day IK. All these absurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are auoided, if wee put the Earth in the Center E. for so in euery oblique Horizon, as in SR, will bee an Equinoctiall, the Sunne risiding in the Aequator. 2 The Heauens will bee diuided into two equall halfes, and PG the excesse of the longest day, will bee equall to KV, the defect of the shortest day: whence wee may conclude the first part of this argument, that the Earth is not besides the Axis in the plaine of the Equinoctiall. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the second position: if wee should place the earth in the Axis of the world out of the plaine of the Equinoctiall, as many, or more absurdities would of necessitie follow: for example sake, let it be imagined in P: First then no Horizon beside a right would cut the Heauen into two equall parts or halfes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently the Zodiack. But this is proued false by experience (as we haue shewed) because six signes of the Zodiacke are alwayes aboue and conspicuous, and the other six vnder. Secondly onely vnder a right Horizon would there bee an Equinoctiall, because only such an Horizon equally diuides the Equatour into two halfes, as may bee seene in the former figure, in which the Equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour is conceaued to bee BD: the right Horizon AC. the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique YZ, cutting the Equator in F into two vnequall parts: Now if it should happen that in any oblique Horizon, there should bee an equinoxe, it could no wise bee in the middle time betwixt the two Solstices, but would be much neerer to the one then to the other; as if the Earth w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>re placed in N, betwixt the Tropicke XH, and the Equatour BD, there would bee an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxe when the Sunne passeth in the parallell by N. which pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell is farre neerer to the Summer Solstice, then the Winter Solstice. But if the Earth were in G, there would happen an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoxe iust in the day of the Summer Solstice; all which are most absurd, and most repugnant to common sense. Thirdly, this granted, the whole order and proportion of increase and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of dayes and nights, would bee confused and troubled. It is agreed on by consent of all Cosmographers, that euery where without the right Horizon, there is such an order and proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the increase &amp; decrease of the dayes and nights, that twice in a yeere the dayes are equall to the nights<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to wit, in the meane,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:8020:63"/>
or middle betwixt the longest and the shortest day, that the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest day is equall to the longest night, and the shortest day to the shortest night. That the excesse of the longest day aboue the Equinoctiall day, is so much as is the defect of the shortest day in regard of the said Equinoctiall day. All which and many more such Apparences would bee interrupted, were the Earth placed any where else then in the Center E; as will appeare by the Scheme. For the Earth being placed in E, euery oblique Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, as SR, will diuide the Equatour BD, into two equall he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micircles, so that so much shall appeare aboue as lies couched vnder, and so that day will bee equall to the night. In like sort the Tropicks HX and IL will bee diuided into two vnequall parts, yet so as the Alternate segments shall bee equall, to wit, PX and VL, also TH and VI, as it is demonstrated by <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>prop.</hi> 16. Whence it comes to passe that the longest day XP is equall to the longest night LV, and the shortest day IV is equall to the shortest night HP. Finally, PG, the excesse of the longest day XP aboue the Equinoctiall day XG, is equall to KV the defect of the shortest day vnder the Equinoctiall day IK, which is shewed out of the similitude and equality of the Triangles TEG, and VEK. Now of the contrary parts, if the Earth should be placed in the Axis without the Center E, as in P, beyond all the parallells, no equinoxe can bee in an oblique Spheare (as wee haue shewed) but alwayes the dayes will bee longer or shorter then the nights. But if the earth bee placed in the point G, by which passeth the last of the parallells, there will be one only equinoxe, &amp; that in the Solstice in an oblique spheare in all other parts of the yeere the dayes would either be longer, or else shorter then the nights. But if the Globe of the Earth bee seated within the parallells in the point N, there would be two Equinoxes in a yeere, wherein the spaces of dayes and nights should increase and decrease. Neuerthelesse these increments &amp; decrements should neither in number nor in greatnesse be equal to the increments and decrements of the nights, as may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered very easily by sense, comparing the two Triangles, DNG, and QNK, because that more and greater segments of parallels are comprehended in the Triangle LNK, then in the Triangle
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:8020:63"/>
PNG. Fourthly, if the Earth should vnequally respect the Poles, and were not placed in the Center, the shadowes of Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons erected which make right angles with the Horizon, should not bee cast directly forward in one right line in the time of the Equinoxes: the Sunne exactly placed in the East or West: as for example: let the earth be A, seated in the plaine of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall circle BC
<figure/>
and let there bee a Gnomon erected on the plaine of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon, which is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the circle BC: It is manifest to sense that the sun set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in C, the shad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes will be cast in the opposite part to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards B. Likewise the Sunne rising in B will cast his shadow towards C. But AC and AB, concurre in one right line, which plainely demonstrats vnto vs, that the earth is seated in the plaine of the Equinoctiall. But if it were placed out of it towards either side, as in E, if a Gnomon be set vp on the Horizon as EF, wee shall see that the Sunne rising in B in the time of the Equinoctiall, the shaddow will bee directed by the line EG, likewise the Sun setting in C, the shaddow will make the right line EH: But these two right lines being produced, will cut one the other in the point E, and therefore cannot concurre in the same right line, whereof ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary experience witnesseth the contrary. Fifthly, if the Earth were thus placed, it would follow by necessary consequence, that two signes of the Zodiacke diametrally opposite, should not be seene by a Dioptricke instrument: which is against experience which witnesseth that the rising and setting of the Sunne, may be seene by one right line: also the rising in the Summer Solstice and the setting in the Winter Solstice, to answer to each other in one right line in euery Horizon: which could not bee perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vnlesse the Earth were in the Equinoctiall plaine and the

Let the Earth first bee placed in the Center A: here may plainely bee perceaued that the Equinoctiall East B, and the Equinoctiall West C, answer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in the right line BC: also that the East point of the Summer Solstice F, and the West of the Winter Solstice I, to concurre in the same right line FI<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> also the Winter East point H, and the Summer Westerne point G, to answer mutually one to the other by the same line GH. Which Apparence is confirmed of all Astronomers. Now let the Earth be set in the Axis out of the Equatour in K: It is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest to sense that the contrary will alwayes happen: For the Winter point of the Sunne setting I, by a right line drawn from the Earth will not directly answer to the Summer point of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing F, but to the point L. Likewise the Winter point of Sunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>setting G, will answer to the point M, and not to the Winter rising H. Whence wee haue sufficiently demonstrated this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond position of the Earth beside the Center of the World to be inconuenient, and no wayes to bee defended. For the third po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition that the earth should be so remoued out of the Center, as that it should neither be in the Equinoctiall plaine, nor yet in the Axell-tree. Wee need produce no other confutation, then what wee haue said before of the other two positions. Because out of this, the same or greater absurdities would follow, then of the other, as any man may easily vnderstand out of these demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions wee haue before recited. The second demonstratiue rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, wherewith <hi>Ptolomy</hi> would confirme the Earth to be in the Center is drawne from the Ecclipse of the Moone in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. If the Earth were not in the Center of the World, there
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:8020:64"/>
would not alwayes happen Eclipses of the Moone, when the two greater lights are diametrally opposed, but sometime they would happen when these great lights are not residing in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site places of the Zodiack; which is false, and against experience; for all Astronomers haue witnessed, that eclipses of the Moone then only are seene, when the Sunne &amp; the Moone stand direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<figure/>
opposite the one to the other: because then is the earth direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly interposed. Now let the Center of the world be A, in which if the Earth bee placed, it is manifest that it then happens when the Sunne and the Moone are exactly opposed, and the earth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terposed directly, which in this case cannot otherwise happen: But if the Earth bee placed beside the Center of the world, as in B. These things may fall out, that the two Luminaries may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side in two opposite points of the Zodiack, and yet cause no e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse; because the Earth is not in the same Diameter by the which they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:8020:65"/>
an Eclipse, when shee is lesse distant from the Sunne then a semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circle. In a word, this eclypse is in places opposite. A semicircle will then only be seene when the Diameter of opposition shall passe by the Center of the Earth, and the world; all which are manifestly repugnant to experience and obseruation. Out of this demonstration of <hi>Ptolomy, Clauius,</hi> a later Astronomer in this sort drawes the like conclusion. Let there be obserued two
<figure/>
diuers eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the Moon in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse places of the Zo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diack: Now because each Eclipse ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened when the Sun and the Moone were oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the one to the other, in one Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter (as Experience &amp; Astrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micall sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations warrant) it must necessarily bee concluded that the earth should bee in each of those Diameters, and so by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in the common section of them both: Sith then all the Diameters of the world concurre, and cut one the other in the Center: it must needs follow that the Earth should bee in the Center and midst of the World. Diuerse reasons there may bee drawne to proue this assertion. But these demonstrations of <hi>Pto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomy,</hi> as I haue set them downe enlarged, and explained by our later writers, may seeme sufficient, especially in a matter of few called in question.</p>

Whence wee finde the motion of these Planets about the <hi>Sunne,</hi> as their owne Center, to bee regular, but about the Earth irregular: which proceeds from their <hi>Excentricity</hi> in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of the Earth. Aboue all the Planets wee place the <hi>Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or Starry Heauen, hauing a very slow motion, not to bee finished in many thousand yeeres, and this motion is on other Poles then the Poles of the world, to bee sought out in or neere the Poles of the <hi>Eclipticke.</hi> This Heauen would <hi>Aristotle</hi> haue to bee the first moueable, and therefore gaue it a very swift motion, which is the same which wee call <hi>Diurnall,</hi> and haue gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to the Earth. But it seemes more consonant to nature, that the slower motions should agree to the higher bodies: and the swifter to the lower, that there might be a proportion, betwixt the time and the space of motion: It remaines that wee proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly shew that out of their suppositions, the Celestiall Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences may bee as well or better salued then by the ordinary grounds. The Apparences which are most called in question, concerne either the <hi>Motion,</hi> or the <hi>Places,</hi> and Positions. All the rest are either of lesse moment, or at least are thereunto redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Euery motion which is found or thought to bee found in the Heauens, is either the <hi>Diurnall,</hi> or <hi>Periodicke.</hi> The <hi>Diurnall</hi> Motion (as wee haue already shewed) belongs to the Earth, which according to our grounds is supposed to moue from the West vnto the East in 24 houres, Which may answer to the Motion of the first moueable Spheare; which according to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> is the Starry Firmament, and thought to moue from the East to the West. The <hi>Periodicke</hi> Motion, is either a slower Motion, to be finished not vnder many thousand yeeres, or else a swifter Reuolution of the Planets. This slow motion the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Astronomers would haue towfold: The one from the <hi>West</hi> to the <hi>East</hi> on the Poles of the <hi>Eclipticke</hi>: the other a Motion (as they call it) of <hi>Trepidation,</hi> from the <hi>South</hi> point to the <hi>North</hi>
                              <pb n="114" facs="tcp:8020:67"/>
and backward againe: but one slow Motion of the sixt Starres vpon the Poles of the Eclipticke, granted to the Firmament, will (for ought I see) satisfy both. The reason why they put two distinct Motions, is, 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Because they haue obserued the Starres of <hi>Aries, Taurus,</hi> and the rest of the <hi>Zodiacke,</hi> not to be seated in the same place wherein they were anciently found; but to be moued certaine degrees from the West towards the East. Whence they would conclude a Motion to bee from the West vnto the East. 2. It will stand with no lesse experience, that the foresaid Starres of the Firmament haue moued themselues from the South towards the North. To passe ouer the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These two Motions, should they bee esteemed in the account of Astronomers might seeme deficient. Notwithstanding wee may probably coniecture this to bee no other then one, and the selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>same Motion vpon the Poles of the <hi>Eclipticke:</hi> Whence it may come to passe, that the fixt Starres are not only carryed from West to East, but also by reason of the obliquity of the <hi>Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke</hi> line, encline more and more dayly to the Pole of the <hi>World</hi> whence they may againe returne. For this motion from the West to the East, is of the primary intent of nature, wherein the Starres moue in circles parallell to the <hi>Eclipticke</hi>: But from the North to the South, as by the necessary consequence of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition and obliquity of the <hi>Zodiacke:</hi> because it cannot bee auoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but that it should either incline to, or decline from the Pole. If they should obiect (as many doe) that this progresse is not proportionall in respect of the time according to the calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Astronomers. Wee answer. 1. That this difference is so small, that it should rather seeme to bee imputed to the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence or ignorance of such as tooke these obseruations, then to any diuersity of motion. For who knowes not in these dayes of ours, wherein this art is arriued at a farre greater perfection, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse Astronomers in obseruing the same Star at the same time, to differ much the one from the other: Whose knowledge not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, is fortified with the experience of the Ancients, and inuention of new Instruments. What then shall wee thinke
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:8020:67"/>
of those, which distant so many ages in time, and vsing diuerse &amp; vnlike Instruments in their obseruations, haue differed in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of so small moment: chiefly in seeking out the period of this long and slow motion, which by reason of his slownes, since the time it was known to man, hath not ranne the fifteenth part of his circle. For my part, I shall rather ascribe it to the errour of their obseruations, then multiply Orbs without a greater cause. First, because (as wee haue said) the difference is so small, and almost insensible 2. Because wee haue beene taught by our Astronomicall histories, what kinde of Instruments were then in vse, which to later Astronomers haue beene thought too rude and vnfit to make such subtile obseruations. Lastly, concerning the <hi>Site</hi> and <hi>Position,</hi> no lesse reason may bee giuen out of our <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> then the common way. For by placing the fiue Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets to runne in their Epicycles about the Sunne, may we giue a reason of the inequality of their distance from the Earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in an ingenious minde in our common grounds can hardly giue himselfe sufficient satisfaction.</p>

Likewise the second way; The earth cannot loose her stability, because (as wee haue shewne in our former Chapter) the earth hath her two Poles magneticall made fast vnto the Poles of the world, as if they were bound firmely to two great pillers, neuer to bee shaken. Finally, The Center of the Earth cannot be moued out of his place any wise, because, as we haue demonstrated in the Chapter before, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the disturbance and inuersion of the whole frame of Nature the Earth can haue no other place then the Center or middest of the whole world. Some haue alleaged as an argument that prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of <hi>Aristotle: That one simple Body can haue but one simple Motion:</hi> and therefore the earth challenging to it selfe a right motion to the Center, cannot also haue a circular or round mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so of necessity must rest vnmoued in her proper place. But this reason, as I haue shewed, is weake to proue this asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. First, because this principle of <hi>Aristotle</hi> is not grounded on certainty, but contradicts experience, as I haue elsewhere shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. 2. This right motion to the Center is not to bee ascribed to the <hi>whole,</hi> as the immediate subiect, but to the <hi>parts</hi> of it sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from the whole; so that nothing will hinder, but that the whole Globe may haue a motion proper to it selfe on his owne Poles. But to let this reason passe as weake; all those argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments alleaged by the common Astronomers, and Philosophers
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:8020:68"/>
against the circular motion of the Earth proue indeed no other matter then this stability which we establish: but if racked any farther come short to satisfie. For authority of Scripture, many places are vrged to proue this stability; whereof wee haue a pregnant place in 104 Psalme, wherein <hi>Dauid</hi> magnifying the Creator, saith <hi>That hee laid the foundation of the Earth so sure, that it should not be moued at any time:</hi> To which may be added many other Texts, but that I hold this one sufficient in a matter which few men call in question. Wee are in the third place to treate of the proportion of the Earth, with the heauenly bodies.</p>

Thirdly, the Starres are not as meere points in respect of their Orbs, because they sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly are seene, as parts of these Orbs.

The first argument shall be this which is most popular. The <hi>Sunne</hi> and many other Starres in the Firmament, are found out by Astronomicall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments to bee manifold greater then the Globe of the Earth: yet appeare they in respect of the heauens but as a little point or portion. Then must the Earth, being in comparison far les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ser, be deuoyd of all sensible magnitude or proportion. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if the Earth had any notable quantity in respect of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, then must the <hi>Diameter</hi> of the earth haue as great a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity in respect of the <hi>Diameter</hi> of the Sky; for there is the same proportion of the Diameters which the circumferences haue one to the other, as is demonstrated in Geometry. Now if the Diameter of the Earth hath any notable magnitude in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>parison of the Diameter of the Skye, then the Starres which be ouer our heads, be neerer vnto vs by a notable quantity, then when they bee either in the East or West. For it must needs follow that the Starres placed in the verticall point, are neerer by the <hi>Semidia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter</hi> of the Earth, then when they are either in the Easterne or Westerne point, as we see in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

be neerer to F. then either A or B. sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to bee the East &amp; west points; because EA, or EB, are the whole <hi>Semidiameter</hi> of the Celestiall cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, whereof FG is only a part. But contrarywise there is no such diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty perceiued in the magnitude of the Starres, but that they appeare still to bee of one and the same greatnesse, except by accidentall interposition of vapours and grosse bodies: wherefore it must of necessity follow, that their distance is all one in all parts of the Skye, and by consequence the Semidiameter of the earth hath no sensible diuersity in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance. Thirdly, hence would arise another reason no lesse for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible then this; that if the Semidiameter of the Earth had any comparison or proportion to the Semidiameter of the Skye, the Horizon that we haue on the vpper part of the earth, should not diuide the Skye into two equall parts; for as much as the part which is couched vnder the Horizon, would alwayes be greater, and the other lesser, as in our former Diagramme: if EF haue a notable quantity in compa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:8020:70"/>
others did rise in the East, shall rise agayne when the other shall set. Fourthly if the earth had any sensible greatnesse in respect of the Heauens, then were it vnpossible for any Sunne Diall to bee regular and obserue due proportion. For we see the shaddowes to moue as duely and orderly about the Center of Dials and such instruments, as if their Center were the very Center of the world: which could neuer happen if these two Centers should differ notably in respect of the Spheare of the Sunne: to expresse it the better we will set this Figure, which represents the three notable circles in a Diall, which are described by the course of the Sunne in three notable places of the Zodiacke, to wit, the two Tropicks, and the Equinoctiall. Herein the vttermost arch
<figure/>
BLC represents the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picke of <hi>Capricorne,</hi> and is described no greater then the quarter of a circle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Sun placed in the Signe, shines vnto vs but six houres. The Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all is set as halfe a circle, because the Sun being in it, appeares vnto vs 12 houres, &amp; is here noted out by EIF. The Tropicke of <hi>Cancer</hi> containes 3 quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a Circle, because when the Sun is in it, there are eighteen houres from Sun-rising to Sun-set: and that circle is GHK. The Center of the Diall is A, and the Style which giues the shadow DA, whose top being D, doth describe those portions of circles with such exactnesse, as if the Diall were set in the very Center of the Earth, and the distinction of the houres shewes it selfe no otherwise then if the Center of the Diall were the same with the Center of the world. To these arguments I may adde, that if there should bee a sensible greatnesse of the earth in respect of these superiour Orbes, either all or most of these absurdities would arise which follow their opinions, who place the Earth out of the Ce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ter of the World, which we haue before treated of.</p>

For although there bee no such circles painted on the face of the Earth, as wee finde in an artificiall Spheare: yet must wee of necessity conceaue such reall respects to bee in the Earth it selfe: as when a Ship sayles ouer the Ocean, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee said to leaue behind any visible marke or Character in

                           <p>Some Astronomers more curious then wise, haue gone about
to seeke a ground of this distinction of a circle into 360 parts out
of the Sunnes course in the <hi>Zodiacke,</hi> a Circle (say they) by
the opening of the Compasse, being described in a plaine, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided
into six equall parts. Now because the Sunne being the
rule and measure of all perfect motions, passeth through one
sixt part in 60 dayes, the whole Circle was diuided into 360,
for 60 multiplied by 6, will produce that number. But this
reason seemes to infer nothing concerning any naturall ground,
that this distinction shall finde in the Earth, though it may serue
as an argument of Conueniency, the number 360 being fittest
for that calculation. Another reason very like the former, is
drawne from the coniunction of the Sunne with the Moone,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:8020:72"/>
which happens 12 times in a yeere: and because from each con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction
to that which followeth are spent 30 dayes; Hence it
is that the Zodiacke is first diuided into 12 parts, which multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
by 30 will produce 360. This reason likewise proues only
thus much, that it is the fittest number to calculate the Motion of
the Sun in his Eclipticke: Not that this diuision hath any ground
in Nature more then other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because being a continuate quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
according to Philosophy, it may suffer infinite diuisions: for
it was in the beginning left free to Cosmographers, to choose
what number they pleased to expresse the parts or sections of a
Circle: which they tooke (as it seemeth) not meerely from the
motion of the Sunne, but from their conueniency, and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity,
finding this number most commodious for the distinction
of euery Circle. The reason was, because no number could bee
found, which suffered more parts and diuisions then this. For as
much as in 60, whereof 360 by multiplication is produced, hath
exactly these parts 1.2.3.4.5.6.10.12.15.20.30. Likewise
360 hath exactly 1.2.3.4.5.6.8.9.10.12.15.18.20.24.30.36.40.46.60.72.90.120.180.
Of all which parts there
is so great vse in Astronomy and many times in Geography, that
without it there would be small exactnesse. For as we see a yard
measure would little steed the Mercer or Clothier, except it
were againe diuided into smaller parts: so fals it out in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count

                        <p>The Meridian Circle is so called of <hi>Astronomers</hi>; because when
the Sun (according to their suppositions) by the motion of the
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:8020:73"/>
first moueable comes into this Circle, it makes mid-day: and then
hath been running his course from his rising to arriue there iust
so long as he shall be mouing from thence to the place of his set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.
In this Meridian are placed the two Poles of the Equator,
which are the same with the Poles of the world; in this also are
the verticall point and the point opposite vnto it, tearmed the
Poles of the Horizon, whereof we shall speake hereafter. So that
so many Meridians are imagined to be in the Earth, as there are
vertical points: for howsoeuer we see not many Meridians pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
on the face of the artificiall Globe, yet must there be so many
imagined in the reall Earth as <hi>Zenithes</hi> and <hi>Horizons:</hi> so that it is
impossible for a man to moue neuer so little from East to West,
without changing his Meridian: yet for more order sake haue
the Cosmographers reduced the number of Meridians to halfe
the number of the degrees in a Circle, to wit, to 180, that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Meridian cutting the Equator, and other Parallels in two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite
places, should answer to two degrees in the same Circle.
By which it appeares, that euery Meridian diuides the Terrene
Globe in two halfes, whereof the one is respectiuely tearmed of
the East, the other of the West. But to auoid all ambiguity of
speech, we ought to consider that a Meridian is twofold; either
the true Meridian, or Magneticall Meridian. The true Meridian,
ordinarily so called, is that which directly passeth by the Poles
of the World; of which wee here treat, which indeed (as wee
shall shew) is the onely true magneticall Meridian. But that
which some haue falsly called the Magneticall Meridian, is that
which runneth by the Poles of the Magneticall Variation, and
much differs from the true; because (as we haue taught) the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation
is diuerse according to the diuersity of place, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
cannot answer in any certaine proportion to the Poles of
the Terrene Globe. The true Meridian Circle, as it hath mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold

The reason why the first Meridian should bee placed here, rather then elsewhere, is thought by some to bee; because the Ancients supposed two <hi>Magneticall</hi> Poles in the Earth, which should bee the cause of the <hi>Variation</hi> of the Compasse. Now because in the <hi>Canary</hi> Ilands, was found no Variation at all, they thought it to bee the place where the <hi>Magneticall</hi> and the <hi>true</hi> Meridian should concurre, as wherein were both the Poles, of the <hi>World,</hi> and of the <hi>Load-stone:</hi> which made them to make it the first Meridian: But this reason I take to bee vnlikely; because as I finde it obserued by latter Writers, in the <hi>Canary</hi> Ilands themselues there is found a <hi>Variation</hi> of the Compasse, although very little: the reason whereof wee haue shewed to bee because it is the middest betwixt two great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinents, to wit, the one of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africa,</hi> the other of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica.</hi> Whose magneticall temper being almost equall, will not suffer the magneticall <hi>Needle</hi> to moue more one way then another: Moreouer, I am certainely perswaded (as far as I can gather) that this placing of the <hi>First Meridian</hi> was appointed here before any certainty was knowne of the <hi>Variation</hi> of the Compasse. The more probable coniecture therefore is that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> here placed the <hi>First Meridian,</hi> because it was the vttermost verge of land toward the West, then discouered, neuer dreaming of a Westerne world afterward

Whence it must needes follow that all Parallels and Meridians in the Globe must cut one the other, and make right angles. These Parallels although infinite in number, may bee in the Spheare reduced to the number of the Meridians, because they are drawne through the opposite points and degrees of the Meridian Semi-circle, which would make vp the number of 180: but yet for <hi>Conueniency</hi> they haue not painted so many in the face of the <hi>Artificiall</hi> Spheare; for as much as so many lines and circles might beget Confusion.

The ground and origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall of this doubt growes out of the obseruation of the fixt Stars, which haue since the Times of the Ancients, beene found to bee moued out of their places, or at least not to retaine the same points in the Period of the <hi>Sunnes</hi> Motion. The chiefest Instances are taken from the stars in the Hornes of <hi>Aries,</hi> which in <hi>Hyparchus</hi> time, which liued aboue 60 yeeres before <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> were obserued to bee not much distant from the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxe,</hi> and before him in the very point it selfe; but in our time remoued about 28 Degrees off: Also it is obserued in the Cynosure or Pole-star, that in <hi>Hyparchus</hi> time it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the Pole about 12 Degrees, which wee finde in our time to bee scarce 3 Degrees distant. To salue this Apparence, <hi>Ptolomy</hi> inuented a slow motion of the <hi>Starry</hi> Heauen or <hi>Fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mament,</hi> whereby the Fixt stars might bee remoued farther off from the Equinoctiall points in the Eclipticke, whence of a consequence the <hi>Pole-starre</hi> should not keep the same positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in respect of the <hi>Pole</hi> it selfe, but vary his site according to the Motion: which opinion hath a long time passed without contradiction; till <hi>Copernicus</hi> out of new grounds sought for this Motion in the Earth, to which hee assigned no lesse then three Motions.

That the <hi>Pole-starre</hi> (saith hee) was so far distant from the <hi>Pole</hi> as 12 Degrees, was no true obseruation, but the errour of <hi>Hyparchus,</hi> who afterwards by his authority deceiued <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi>; and He, Posterity. The Reasons hee alleadged are, 1 Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>Eudoxus</hi> which was more ancient then <hi>Hyparchus,</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued the same star to bee in no other place, then where now it is. 2 Because that greater light of Astronomy, <hi>Copernicus</hi> percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the <hi>Equinoxes</hi> and <hi>Solstitiall</hi> points to be moued, was enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to inuent other grounds; but because his demonstrations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended only on the <hi>Apparences,</hi> hee sought out this effect in the motion of the Earth. If it were manners to oppose so great a Scholler as <hi>Ioseph Scaliger,</hi> I would aske a few questions, why we should not credite the obseruations of <hi>Hyparchus, Ptolomy,</hi> and all <hi>posterity,</hi> as well as of <hi>Eudoxus:</hi> sith Antiquity without consent &amp; approbation, is no great argument of truth. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse if the matter be well examined, we shall perhaps find Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity to be more firme on our side. The same reason (as I take it) may be giuen for the stars in the Hornes of <hi>Aries,</hi> as of the <hi>Pole-starre,</hi> because all the <hi>fixt-starres,</hi> by the consent of all, are imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to keep the same vniforme site among themselues in such sort, as the varying of some would disorder all the rest: at least ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue the like variety or change of all. Now to proue the stars of <hi>Aries</hi> to haue beene varyed, many of the Ancients (as Master <hi>Hues</hi> hath obserued) liuing in diuers times, haue confirmed. The first star of <hi>Aries,</hi> which in the time of <hi>Meto Atticus,</hi>
                              <pb n="142" facs="tcp:8020:81"/>

If any should obiect, that <hi>Eudoxus</hi> spake onely of the <hi>Pole-starre,</hi> and not of the stars, in the hornes of <hi>Aries</hi>; I ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were, as before, that the same reason is to bee giuen of them both; For as much, as if the <hi>Pole-starre</hi> in <hi>Eudozus</hi> time mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in a Parallell, Equidistant from the <hi>Pole</hi> of the Equatour (which he seemes to contend) then must also the stars of <hi>Aries,</hi> which were found once to bee in the point of the vernall Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxe, moue alwayes in the Equinoctiall circle, and neuer vary from it; which is contrary to all the Testimonies before allead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged.

That the first Star of <hi>Aries</hi> is more distant from the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall point, is a matter which seemes to bee agreed on by all sides. This Apparence must necessarily arise out of some Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This Motion must bee sought either in the <hi>Earth</hi> (as <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernicus</hi> would haue:) or in the <hi>Heauens.</hi> That it cannot with any great probability bee in the Earth, wee haue shewed in the third Chapter, where wee haue proued it to haue a Magneticall verticity, whereby it continually respects the same <hi>Poles.</hi> The Arguments (I confesse) are only probable: but this is an opinion which <hi>Scaliger</hi> defendeth not. If wee seeke this effect in the Heauens, it must of necessity (which <hi>Scaliger</hi> confesseth) happen one of these 2 wayes: For either the stars standing vnmoueable, the Equinoctiall &amp; Solstitiall points must bee moued, or els the stars themselues should moue, as <hi>Ptolomy</hi> defends. Here I cannot but remember a merry answer of that great <hi>Atlas</hi> of Arts, Sir <hi>Henry Sauile</hi> in the like question. Being once inuited vnto his Table, and hauing entred into some familiar discourses concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning <hi>Astronomicall</hi> suppositions: I asked him what he thought of the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> who held the <hi>Sunne</hi> to stand <hi>fixt,</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> to bee subiect to a <hi>Triple</hi> Motion: His answer was; hee cared not which were true, so the Apparences were solued, and the accompt exact: sith each way either the old of <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> or the new of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> would indifferently serue an Astronomer: Is it not all one (saith he) sitting at Dinner, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my Table be brought to mee, or I goe to my Table, so I eat my meat? Such an answer would aswell befit this question: whether the first star of <hi>Aries</hi> should bee moued from the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctiall</hi>

point, or the <hi>point</hi> from it, 'tis a matter should little trouble a <hi>Cosmographer</hi>; so either way might indifferently serue to salue the apparent obseruations: But how <hi>Scaliger</hi> vpon this granted supposition, would make all whole, without disturbing the order and forme of Nature in the celestiall Machine? what Regular motion he would giue the Sunne, whose period des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes the <hi>Equinoctiall points,</hi> which he makes moueable? what other <hi>Poles</hi> he would assigne to the world besides that of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator? is a matter of a more curious search, and besides the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of my subiect: The full discussion of which points, as most of the rest: <hi>Illis relinquo quorum imagines lambunt—Hederae se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaces.</hi>

here wee are to note, that the Horizon is two fold; either the <hi>Rationall</hi> or <hi>Sensible</hi> Horizon.

Secondly, because the rationall is alwayes certaine and the same, in the same place, and of alike greatnesse; whereas the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is greater or lesser, for the condition of the place or sight; for the semidiameter of the rationall, is the same with the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiameter of the earth; but the semidiameter of the other, seldome or neuer exceeds 60 miles on the Earth.

Here it is to bee noted, that a <hi>Rhumbe</hi> differs from a <hi>Winde</hi>; whereas a <hi>Rhumber</hi> is one line, pointing out vnto vs, two windes or coasts: These Rhumbes as they are conceiued in the Globe, were thought by <hi>Nonnus</hi> to bee the portions of greater Circles: But learned M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                           <hi>Hues</hi> in his booke, out of vndoubted principles, strongly confutes him. The grounds which hee takes are these: First, that all Meridians of all places passe the Pole, and cut the Equatour and all his paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels at right Angles. Secondly, If our course should bee directly any way else, then towards one of the poles, a new <hi>Meridian</hi> must succeed, and a new <hi>Horizon.</hi> Thirdly, that the Iron Needle being touched with the <hi>Load-stone,</hi> shewes the common section of the <hi>Meridian</hi> and the Horizon, and on one side perpetually respects the <hi>North,</hi> on the other the South. Fourthly, the same <hi>Rhumbe</hi> cuts all the <hi>Meridians</hi> atall places at equall Angles, and euery where respects the like coasts in the world. Fiftly, that a greater circle drawne by the Verticall points (if remoued from the Equatour) cannot cut diuers <hi>Meridians</hi> at equall Angles. Sixtly, a greater circle drawne by the Verticall point of any place, makes greater Angles with all other <hi>Meridians</hi> then with that, from which it was first drawne: whence it is necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that the line which shall bee supposed to make Angles with diuers <hi>Meridians</hi> (as the <hi>Rhumbes</hi>) should bee bowed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Meridian.

suppose (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer figure) the Center of the eye wherein consists the sight, to be in the point of the Terrestriall sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face F, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance (as wee said) betwixt F and E the Center being insensible, the eye is imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the center: likewise the Horizons CFD, and AEB for the same cause

in respect of the Heauens are to bee esteemed one and the same; because CA and DB haue no sensible difference. It is then manifest, that the eye so placed will behold in the heauenly Spheare, all which is included betwixt A and B, to wit, the Hemispheare AGB, bounded by the Rationall Horizon AEB. Neuerthelesse in the Terrene Globe it can see no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing at all: For either it should see onely the point F, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it is seated, or else some other point or part distant from it: the former cannot bee admitted, because the eye being there supposed to bee placed, should according to this suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on behold it selfe, which is against philosophy: For granting the sense only a direct and not a reflexe operation, it cannot bee imagined how it should perceiue it selfe. Finally, it cannot see any point in the Earth besides; for then this point would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bee placed aboue the point F: but this cannot bee; because F being supposed in the superficies, admits of no point higher in the Spheare, or else vnder it: but this cannot bee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause CFD being a tangent line, and touching the Spheare in F only: there cannot according to Geometricall principles bee drawne any right line from the point F, which can touch any point in the said Spheare, but all will cut it, and so the section cause impediment to the sight, the Earth being an opacous and round body.</p>

                        <p>This distinction growes naturally out of the Respect of the Horizon to the Equatour. For sith the Equatour is one and the selfe-same immoueable circle; and the Horizon is mutable and changed according to his diuerse verticall points, they cannot alwayes keepe the same situation in regard one of the other.

The cause of this va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation of Horizons is the naturall roundnesse of the Earth: For the earth being supposed to bee sphericall, as we haue before demonstrated, it must of necessity follow, that the site of the poles should be changed according to the diuersity of the places. Also, because wheresoeuer we are placed on the Earth (as wee haue shewed) all impediments of the sight, as mountaines and vallies put apart, we can behold the Hemispheare of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, which middle part being set downe is diuided from the part vnseene, by the Horizon it must needs bee, that either both the poles must be in the Horizon: and so make a Right Spheare: or at least one must bee aboue and seene, and the other hid from the sight, and so much as one is eleuated aboue the Horizon, must the other bee couched vnder it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For otherwise wee should see more or lesse then a precise moity, or halfe of the Heauens: sith the poles differ one from the other the halfe of the whole Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens: to wit, by the Diameter of the world.</p>

                           </argument>
                           <p>To explaine the true composition of the Artificiall Globe, not Physically as it consists of timber and mettall, but <hi>Geogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phically</hi> as it represents the Earth, we are to consider, that the parts of it are either <hi>Externall</hi> or <hi>Internall:</hi> Externall I call those parts which are without the Spheare it selfe, yet necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily concurre to the constitution of it. These parts are such as concurre to the making of the Stocke or Frame whereunto our Spheare is set: where to let passe the footing or lower board, (wherein in the old Globes was engraffed a <hi>Marriners Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe,</hi> with a <hi>Needle magnetically</hi> touched, very profitable for the direction of the Spheare) I will onely speake of the great Timber Circle, encompassing round the whole Globe: because it more immediatly concernes our purpose. This Circle repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the <hi>Horizon</hi> of the Naturall Spheare: In the Globe it is made but one, not that there is but one Horizon in the whole Earth; because (as we haue taught) the Horizon is varyed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the places: but because it is impossible to point and marke out the Horizons; for all places being infinite as the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall points: yet may this one serue for all places, because the Globe being moueable, may apply all his parts to this circle. This Circle representing the Horizon, is diuided into three borders or Limbes: whereof the first which is towards the Spheare, containes all the <hi>signes</hi> with the <hi>Planets</hi> thereunto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing; euery of which is diuided into 30 Degrees, which in the Timber Circle are described by set numbers and markes. The second which is the middle-most and largest, contaynes the Calendar, with the Golden number, and seuerall names of all the Feasts throughout the yeare. The third and last is of the 22 Windes, seruing chiefly for the vse of Marriners, and may serue many wayes for a <hi>Geographer</hi> to distinguish the <hi>Coasts</hi> and
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:8020:92"/>
points of the Earth. But of these three borders distinguished in the Horizon, only the last hath vse in <hi>Geography</hi>; the other two are in themselues Astronomicall, and placed in the Geographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Globe rather for ornament, then vse. The Internall parts of the Globe are either annexed or inscribed in the face of the Spheare. The Annexed part is that which represents the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, which is a Brasen circle: For as the Externall Frame of the Globe contained the Horizon as one circle; so this Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an is set but one, although it bee in it selfe various, according to the places to which it serue. Neither without good reason is this Circle made of <hi>brasse,</hi> because it should serue for diuerse vses, which require that it should bee often changed and turned to and fro, which being of Timber would miscarry. This Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen Meridian meetes with the Horizon at two opposite places, cutting it at right angles, that the Spheare included might bee raysed and set lower, as occasion requireth. The Meridian circle is agayne diuided into 4 <hi>Quadrants,</hi> each of which is againe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into 90 <hi>Degrees</hi>; so that on the one side the 90<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Degree must touch the Pole; on the other side the first degree; so that in all there will arise 360 degrees, described in the Brasen Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian. Through this Brasen Meridian by the two Poles doth passe a line or wier, which is called the <hi>Axell-tree</hi> of the Globe, about the which the Spheare is turned, the ends of which are commonly called the Poles; whereof the one representing the <hi>North point</hi> is called the <hi>Pole Articke</hi>; the other shewing the <hi>South,</hi> is termed <hi>Antarticke.</hi> To this Meridian Circle in the Globe is commonly fastned a little Brasen Circle, named <hi>Cyclus horarius</hi> or the <hi>houre-circle</hi>; but this rather appertaines to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomy</hi> then <hi>Geography,</hi> and therefore wee will forbeare to describe it: somewhat more vse haue wee of another Instrument fastned to the Meridian, called the <hi>Quadrant</hi> of <hi>Latitude</hi>; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as much as it may serue to measure the Distance betwixt any two places signed in the Globe: but in so grosse an Instrument little exactnesse can bee expected. Now for such matters as are inscribed in the Spheare it selfe, (to let passe ridiculous &amp; idle pictures vsed of Painters for ornament) they are either Lines &amp; Circles drawne on the face of the Globe: or else the pictures &amp;
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:8020:92"/>
delineations of Countreyes and places, marked out in visible proportions; whereof the former properly appertaines to the <hi>Sphericall</hi> part of Geography; the latter to the <hi>Topicall.</hi> The Circular Lineaments are againe twofold: either Circles necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily appertaining to the constitution of the Globe; or else Lines thereon drawne to bee considered of Marriners, which we haue before called the <hi>Rhumbes.</hi> But these Lines also (as wee haue taught) appertaine to the <hi>Geographer,</hi> being as many sections of the Horizontall Circle; because they are alwayes imagined to proceed from a Verticall point wherein they meet. The Circles painted on the Globe are either the <hi>Parallels</hi> or <hi>Meridians,</hi> whose description we haue set downe in the chapter before: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Parallels the most remarkable is the <hi>Equatour,</hi> which is made greater then all the rest, in forme of a bracelet, distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished into degrees, and marked at euery 10. degrees: Next to this are the Tropicks and Polar Circles, represented only by blacke Lines, yet framed in such sort, that they may easily bee discerned from other Parallels. Amongst the Meridians the most notable is the first Meridian passing by the <hi>Canaries,</hi> and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted much like the <hi>Equatour,</hi> cut into diuers sections and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, in such sort as wee haue described: For the Zodiacke which is vsually pictured in the Terrestriall Globe, I hold it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together needlesse in Geography, and made rather for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, then vse; for as much as the periodicke course of the Sun, deciphered by the Eclipticke, appertaines rather to the <hi>Theory,</hi> of the planets, which is the hardest part of <hi>Astronomy.</hi> The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of these Circles, Site, and Distance is taught before, and needs no repetition, sith it is the very same in representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on the face of the Globe, which is really in the Earth it selfe.

                           </argument>
                           <p>This Theoreme seeming at the first obscure, consists of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny parts, which being once opened, will soone take light. First then to know the Ground-worke of this <hi>Parallellogramme</hi> thus defined, wee must suppose a Sphericall superficies, Geographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call or Hydrographicall, with Meridians and parallels to bee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed into a concaue Cylinder, their Axes agreeing in one. Secondly wee must imagine the superficies thus inscribed, to swell like a bladder, blowing equally in euery part, as well in Longitude, as Latitude, till it apply it selfe round about, and all along towards either pole, vnto the concaue superficies of the Cylinder; so that each parallell on this superficies, successiuely
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:8020:94"/>
growes greater from the Equinoctiall towards either Pole, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till it challenge equall Diameter with the Cylinder: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise all the Meridians growing wider and farther off, till they bee as farre distant euery-where as is the Equinoctiall one from the other. Hence may easily bee vnderstood the true Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall production or generation of this part: for first of a Spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call superficies it is made a Cylinder: and secondly of a Cylinder it is made a Parallellogramme, or plaine superficies: For the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caue superficies of a Cylinder is nothing else but a plaine Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lellogramme, imagined to bee wound about two equall equidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant circles, hauing one common Axell-tree perpendicular vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Centers of them both; and the <hi>Peripheries</hi> of them both, equall to the length of the Parallellogramme, as the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt those Centers is equall to the bredth thereof: In this Chart so conceiued to be made, all places must needs be situate in the same Longitudes and Latitudes, Meridians, Parallels, and Rhumbes, which they had in the Globe it selfe: because we haue imagined euery point betwixt the Equatour and the Poles, to swell equally in Longitude and Latitude, till it apply it selfe to the concauity of the Cylinder: so that no point can bee displaced from his proper seat, but only dilated in certaine proportion.

                           <p>It hath beene thought by many Geographers, that the Earth cannot aptly according to due symmetry and proportion be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in a plaine superficies, as it is in the Globe: for as much as that which is ioyned and vnited in the Globe, being of a Sphericall figure, is in the Mappe extended and dilated to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse longitude and latitude from that Sphericall delineation: and although it hath been generally conceited by many writers, that no due proportion could bee obserued in a Sphericall super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, without sensible errour: yet most exception hath beene made against this <hi>Chart</hi> here mentioned, consisting of one face
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:8020:95"/>
and straight lines, which in substance (if we co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider the Circles) differs not from the Nauticall Chart: of whose errours <hi>Martin Cortese, Peter Nonnus,</hi> and many others haue complained: which escapes are excellently opened and reformed by our Countryman <hi>Edward Wright</hi> in his Correction of Nauticall Errours. The reason or ground which drew these men to thinke that the Earth could not bee proportionably described in a plaine superficies, proceeded from the common proportion of the Lines and Circles on the Chart. For supposing the Parallels cutting the Meridians at equall Angles, to obserue an equall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance euery-where one from the other; these errours and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surdities must of necessity ensue. First, what places soeuer are delineate in the ordinary Chart, the length of them from East to West hath a greater proportion to the bredth from North to South then it ought to haue, except onely vnder the Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall: and this errour is so much the more augmented, by how much those places are distant from the Equinoctiall: for the neerer you approach the Pole, the proportion of the Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian to the Parallell still increaseth; so that at the Parallell of 60 degrees of latitude, the proportion of the length to the bredth is twice greater then it ought to bee; for as much as the Meridian is double to that Parallell, and so in all the rest: whence as <hi>Edward Wright</hi> obserues, the proportion of the length of <hi>Friesland</hi> to the bredth thereof, is two-fold greater then in the Globe which expresseth the true proportion; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Meridian is double to the Parallell of that Iland. In like sort it is plaine, that in the Ilands of <hi>Grock-land</hi> and <hi>Groen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the length to the bredth hath a foure-fold greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion in the Common Chart, then in the Globe; because the Meridian is foure-fold greater then the Parallell of those pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Wherefore it cannot be conceited, that the manner of fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out the difference of Longitude by the common Chart, can bee any-where true without sensible errour, except onely vnder the Equinoctiall, or neere about it; because in no other place the Parallell is equall to the Meridian. In other places the errour will bee sensible, according to the difference of the Meridian, and Parallell of that place: whereas if the contrary
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:8020:95"/>
were granted, it would follow, that two ships sayling from North to South, vnder two seuerall Meridians, would keepe the same distance the one from the other of longitude neere the Pole, which they had neere the Equatour; which is impossible: because Meridians cannot bee Parallell the one to the other, but by how much they approach the Pole, by so much they are neerer, that in the end they all concurre and meete in the Pole it selfe. Secondly this common Chart admitted, there would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise great errours not onely in the situation of diuers places, which appeare to bee vnder the same Meridian, but also in the <hi>bearing</hi> of places one to the other. The reason is manifest, for that the Meridian is a certaine Rule of the site and position of places: therefore whensoeuer any errour shall be committed in the Site and Position of the Meridian, there must needs follow errours in the designation of the Rhumbes, and other points of the Compasse. And therefore euery respectiue position of place to place, set downe in the common Chart, cannot bee warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. A pregnant example wee haue in the way from <hi>India</hi>; for the Promontory of <hi>Africke,</hi> called the Promontory of three Points; hauing of Northerne latitude 4 Degrees and a halfe, and the Iland of <hi>Tristan, Acugna,</hi> hauing 36 degrees of Southerne latitude, are in the common Chart set vnder the same Meridian: But the Chart sheweth the distance betweene these Ilands, and the <hi>Cape of good Hope</hi> to come neere to 400 leagues; both which cannot stand together; for if all the coast from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montory of <hi>Three Points,</hi> vnto the Cape of <hi>Good-hope</hi> be right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly measured, and the Promontory of Three Points lye also vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same Meridian with those Ilands, yet must the distance bee much lesse: But if it be not lesse, it cannot stand with reason that it should haue the same Meridian with the Promontory of Three Points, but must needes lye more Westward. Thirdly, there must needs arise a greater errour in the translating Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coasts and other such places out of the common Chart, into the Globe; because they haue only a respect to the Numbers of Degrees of Longitudes and Latitudes found therein; so that not onely errours appeare in the Sea-Chart, but also other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where thence deriued. These and many more errours haue been
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:8020:96"/>
detected in the common Sea-chart, which (as we haue said) res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting the circles, ought to be imagined one and the selfe-same with the proiection of the lines in a Geographicall table; which ouersight <hi>Ger. Mercator</hi> in his vniuersall Map seemes to correct: yet leaues no demonstration behind him to teach others the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine way to draw the Lines, as Meridians, Parallels, &amp; Rhumbes on the Chart, in such sort, as these errours might be preuented, and the due proportion and symmetry of places well obserued. But our industrious Countryman hath waded through all these difficulties, and found out the true demonstration of a proiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of these Lines to be inscribed in the Chart in such sort, as no sensible errour can shew it selfe, from whose copious industry wee will extract so much as may serue our purpose, onely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting his inuention into a shorter method, hauing many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to passe through in this Treatise.</p>

                           </argument>
                           <p>It hath been a conceiued errour (as we haue shewed) that all the parallels in the Chart here mentioned, should euery-where keep the same Distances one from the other, from the Equator to the poles; yet because no man (for ought I know) hath out of Geometricall grounds discouered the true proportion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side my fore-named Author; I must herein also follow his dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection as neere as I can in his owne footsteps; because I would not any way preiudice his Inuention. First therefore wee must consider in that Chart, because the parallels are equall one to the other, (for euery one is set equall to the Equinoctiall) the Meridians also must bee parallell and straight Lines, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence the Rhumbes, making equall angles with euery Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, must bee also straight lines. Secondly, because the spheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call superficies whereof the Chart is imagined to be produced, is conceiued to swell and enlarge it selfe euery-where equally, that is, as well in Longitude as Latitude, till it accommodate it selfe to the hollownesse of the Cylinder, round about: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at euery point of Latitude in this Cylinder so dilated, a
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:8020:96"/>
part of the Meridian obtaines the same proportion to the like part of the Parallell, that the like parts of the Meridian and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell haue to each other in the Globe without sensible er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. Now for as much as like parts of the wholes, haue the same proportion that these wholes haue; therefore the like parts of any Parallell or Meridian of the Spheare haue the same proportion that the same Parallels and Meridians haue: For example sake, as the Meridian is double to the Parallell of 60 Degrees, so a Degree, Minute, or other part, is also double to a Degree, Minute, or other part of the Parallell; and what proportion the Parallell hath to the Meridian, the same must their Diameters and Semidiameters haue one to the other: as is taught by Geometricians. Now the Signe of the Complement of the Parallels latiude or distance from the Equinoctiall, is the semi-diameter of the said Parallell; as in this Diagramme here inserted may
<figure/>
easily appeare: for AE the signe of AH the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of AF, the latitude of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell ABCD from the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall is the semi-diameter of the Parallell ABCD; and as the semi-diameter of the Meridian or whole signe is to the semi-diameter of the Parallell; so is the secant or Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuse of the Parallells latitude to the semi-diameter of the Meridian, or to the whole signe, as FK (that is) AK, to AE (as is) GK, so is IK to FK: therefore in this Geographicall Chart, the semi-diameter of each Parallell being equall to the semidiameter of the Equinoctiall or whole signe, the parts of the Meridian at euery point of latitude, must of necessity en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease with the same proportion wherewith the Secants of the Arch contained betweene these points of latitude and the Equinoctiall encrease: out of which Geometricall
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:8020:97"/>
grounds thus explained, will arise a certaine and easie methode for the making of a table by the helpe of Trigonometry, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Meridian in any Geographicall or Hydrographicall table may truly and in due proportion diuide it selfe into parts, from the Equinoctiall towards either Pole: for taking for granted, each distance of each point of latitude, or of each Parallell one from the other, to comprehend so many points as the secants of the latitude of each point or Parallell containes, wee may draw out a table by continuall addition of the secants answerable vnto the latitude of each Parallell, vnto the summe compounded of all the former Secants; beginning with the secants of the first Parallels latitude, and thereunto adding the second Parallels la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, and to the summe of both these, adding the third Paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lels latitude, and so forth in all the rest: and this Table will shew the sections and points of latitude in the Meridian of the Geographicall Mappe; through which sections the Parallels ought to bee drawne: which Table wee haue lately set out by <hi>Edward Wright</hi> in his Correction of Nauticall Errours, to whom for further satisfaction in this kind, I referre the diligent Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Out of the same grounds we may also deduce the Rumbes: for sith that the Chart (as wee haue shewed) is nothing else but a plaine <hi>Parallellogramme,</hi> conceiued to be made of the extension of a Sphericall superficies, inscribed in a concaue Cylinder, it must needs be that the Rumbes make equall Angles with all the <hi>Meridians.</hi> Therefore if in the Chart a circle be drawne, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into 32 equall parts, beginning with the <hi>Meridian,</hi> pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing by the Center of that Circle, the lines drawne from the center of these sections, will be the Rumbes for that place.</p>

For to imagine the Eye to bee set at an infinite distance, were to deny a sight or aspect which they would haue to bee the ground of this proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: For no object can bee perceiued, but such as is bounded and determined in a certaine and proportionate space. Neither can the later way passe cleere without exception; because to such a projection, such a sight is required which can see the whole Hemispheare: for otherwise would it be vnperfect, and want of the perfection of the Globe: which containes two ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and entire Hemispheares. But now no place can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined without the Globe, wherein the Eye can be so placed, as to see the one halfe or Hemispheare: for as much as it is impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible from the opposite points of any Diameter, to draw two tangent lines which may meet together, or cut one the other in the same point, but will bee Parallell the one to the other: wherefore wee may conclude, that the Eye in this projection cannot be imagined without the conuexe surface of the Spheare, but rather in the concaue: How the Eye should bee imagined to be in the concaue superficies, may be in this sort explayned: wee must suppose a great Spheare of the Glasse, or other such Diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous matter, inscribed with all his Parallels and Meridians, in such sort as they are represented vnto vs in the Globe, the Eye (according to opticall Principles) may bee so placed neere the

First because the former is grounded merely on <hi>Artificiall Imitation,</hi> implying nothing else but a <hi>Respect</hi> or application: whereas this magneticall <hi>Terrella</hi> not only repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents externally the Earth, but Internally out of its owne <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neticall</hi> nature and vigour, eminently containes and expresses all those motions and magneticall vertues, which we haue former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly shewed to bee in the Earth. 2 It skills not in the former of what <hi>Materiall substance</hi> the Spheare consists, so the parts of it answer in due symmetry and proportion to the parts of the Earth; but this represents the whole as a <hi>Homogeneall</hi> part com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating the same nature &amp; substance with the whole spheare of the earth: In the <hi>Fabricke</hi> of this instrument wee must consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, 1 the <hi>Matter:</hi> 2 the <hi>Forme:</hi> The matter (as wee haue already intimated) is a <hi>Magneticall</hi> substance which ought to be chosen out of a most eminent Mine, hauing all his parts pure and vnmixt, as possible wee can finde in any Magnet. For though all Loadstones haue the same inclination, yet in many the vigour is so weake, or at least so hindered by the mixture of some <hi>Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneall</hi>

matter, that they will not so well and sensibly performe their office. The forme of it is the roundnesse &amp; politure, wherin Art should shew as much exactnesse as shee can: such a Spheare may well be expressed in this Figure, whereof we had formerly occasion to make vse: wherein the footsteps of this Magneticall vigour are sensibly expressed, no otherwise then in the great Body of the Earth.</p>

                           <p n="1">1 HItherto haue we handled the Terrestriall Globe primarily: in such proprieties as absolutely agree vnto its nature. In the second place we are to handle such as secondarily a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise out of the former.

                        </argument>
                        <p>Good reason haue we to cal this the <hi>Secondary</hi> part of <hi>Geography</hi>; for as much as these accidents and proprieties we here consider, arise altogether out of the former. In the former Treatise wee haue diuided the <hi>Naturall</hi> Spheare of the Earth, from the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall: But in this part, for auoiding of tedious repetitions of the same things, wee haue ioyned them together: For howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the measuring and dictinctions of the Earth bee truely grounded on the nature of the earth it selfe; yet can it not be well expressed and taught without the materiall Instrument: we haue therefore thought good to consider the measure of the earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wee come vnto the Distinction, because it is more simple and vncompound, depending on the lineaments and measure of one circle: whereas the Distinction necessarily requires the coniunction and combination of diuerse circles, as <hi>Meridians</hi> and <hi>Parallels</hi> compared one with the other, as shall bee taught hereafter. Whether the great masse of the earth can bee mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured, or no, seemes a matter not agreed on by all; Some haue held an opinion that it cannot bee measured, in regard of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:8020:103"/>
the infinite magnitude wherewith they thought it endowed: which opinion seemes deriued from some of the <hi>Platonicks,</hi> who ascribing to the Earth another figure besides the <hi>Sphericall,</hi> haue cast themselues vpon vncertainties, and being notable to reduce the Quantity of the Earth according to their owne grounds to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny certaine measure, haue denied it to bee measurable: But the ground of this opinion wee haue taken away before, in prouing the earth to be of a true Sphericall nature and therefore circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed in certaine bounds apt to be measured. Another conceit more absurd then the former, is not only the common people, whose condition might excuse their ignorance, but of such as would bee esteemed learned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who contend, that the greatnesse of the earth cannot bee measured: the onely reasons they can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge for themselues are, 1 That a great part of the earth is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accessible by reason of steepe rocks, high mountaines, spacious and thicke woods, moorish fogges, and such like impediments. 2 That the parts of it are for the most part vneuen, and subiect to no regular figure, without the which no measure can bee exact. The first cauill is of no moment; because whereas wee affirme that the Earth by man may be measured, we hold it not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry that it should be trauersed ouer by iourneyes or voyages. For as much as to the finding out of the Quantity of the whole Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restriall Spheare, it may seeme sufficient to know the measure and proportion of any little part in respect of the Heauens. As for example, what number of <hi>Miles, Leagues,</hi> or <hi>Furlongs</hi> ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer to any <hi>degree</hi> or <hi>degrees</hi> in the Heauens: wherfore we sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the Earth to be measured ouer not with our feet, but with our wits, which may by Mathematicall rules be taught to march forward where our legges fayle vs: The second obiection only proues thus much, that the Earth partaking of so many vnequall parts and irregular formes, cannot in the measuring admit of so much exactnesse, as if it were endowed with one vniforme face: yet it is exact enough to contenta <hi>Cosmographer,</hi> who measureth not by feet and inches, but by leagues and miles, in which wee little regard such a needlesse curiosity.</p>

For example sake, wee will take two famous Cities of <hi>England, Oxford</hi> and <hi>Yorke</hi>; which are situated, if not exactly, yet very neere the same Meridian. The eleuation of the Pole here with vs at <hi>Oxford</hi> is 51 degrees and 30 minutes; at <hi>Yorke</hi> it is 54 de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees 30 minutes, or neere there about: subtract the lesser from the greater, the distance betwixt <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Yorke</hi> will bee three degrees; which distance experimentally knowne in miles, will shew the proportion: which wee shall finde to bee, (abating somewhat in regard of the crookednesse of the way) about 180, answering to three degrees of the Meridian:
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:8020:105"/>
wherefore to one degree will answer 60 Miles, which being multiplied by 360, the whole circle will produce 21600, the measure of the whole Earth. The like may bee performed by an Eclipse in two Citties lying vnder the Equinoctiall circle: two land-markes being once noted out, lying vnder the Equino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiall, let there bee obserued in both the same Eclipse of the Moone, especially in the beginning: Now it being certainely found out how many houres the Eclipse beganne in the one place before the other, wee must resolue their houres into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, which is easily done: for as much as to euery houre an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres 15 degrees in the Sunne Diurnall motion, according to Astronomers. Now the distance betweene these two Citties or markes (being supposed first experimentally to be knowne, will easily shew the correspondency betwixt the Degrees and miles, which is here sought. Another way is taught by <hi>Possido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> as easie as the former, which is performed by some noted fixt Starre, as <hi>Oculus Tauri, Arcturus, Spica Virginis,</hi> or any other; let there bee obserued vnder the same Meridian in the Earth two places, whose distance is experimentally knowne: in both these places let the Meridian altitude of the Starre be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and perfectly obserued: The difference of these two Altitudes will bee the number of degrees betwixt these two places: whence we may obserue how many miles, or other partsanswer to the number of these degrees betwixt these two places.

I preferre the iudgements of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                              <hi>Robert Hues</hi>; For as much as it is not grounded on common tradition, but industriously by himselfe deriued out of the Ancients by diligent search and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, as by one, whose iudgement being armed as well with skill in the language, as the knowledge of antiquity, scornes to be iniured by translation. What should bee the cause of these differences, is a matter which hath staggered curious searchers into Antiquities more then the former. Euery opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being supported with the names and authorities of such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Authors, might challenge a pitch aboue the measure of my Decision: only I may not bee thought ouer presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:8020:107"/>
to coniecture where I cannot define, especially hauing so good a guide as my forenamed Author, to tread out the way before mee. Wherefore supposing as a ground, these Authors so much differing about the measure of the earth, to haue beene in some sort led by reason. The differences must needs arise out of one of these causes: either the errour or negligence of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruers, in trusting too much to others relations without any farther search, or else the defect in the Mathematicall grounds out of which they deriued their demonstration; or the diuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of measures vsed in this worke: or finally, from the misap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of these measures to the distances; whence may arise some errour out of the experimentall measuring of places in the earth. In the first place it may perhaps be doubted whether <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristotle</hi> defining the measure of the Earth to bee 400000 fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs, were not deceaued by relations: for as much as hee auou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth it, from the Mathematicians of his times, whose authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and credit for ought wee know, deserues as well to bee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten as their names. But this answer might seeme too sharp in the other: for as much as wee find them registred for Masters in their science, and such as could not easily bee cosened by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers impostures. Neither can wee imagine the second to bee any cause of their errour for the same reason: because the wayes these Mathematicians vsed in finding out the circuit of the earth, are by writers of good credit commended to posterity, as warrantably grounded on certaine demonstrations, being no other then what wee haue shewed before, which admit of no Parallogisme: In the third place wee ought to examin whether the diuersity of opinion concerning this matter pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from diuersity of the measures which were vsed in this worke. <hi>Nonnius</hi> and <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This measure notwithstanding is by many translated a Pace: by what reason, let any man iudge. <hi>Xilander</hi> in translating <hi>Strabo</hi> renders it an Ell: Secondly for a Furlong it containes according to <hi>Herodoiu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Now for the variety of Furlongs, it is true that <hi>Censorinus</hi> makes three kindes.

But to let passe this latter, we shall finde by serious consideration, that the <hi>Italian</hi> and <hi>Olympian</hi> Furlongs differ only in name, and are indeed the same.

For a Foot with the <hi>Grecians</hi> exceeds the <hi>Roman</hi> Foot by a twenty fourth part: as much as is the difference betwixt 600 and 625. Hence wee see how lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle certainty can bee expected of such as goe about to reconcile these opinions out of the various vse and acception of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. The most probable assertion then is, that the errour was grounded on this, that the distances of places, mentioned by the foresaid Authors, were not by themselues exactly measured, but taken vp vpon trust on the relation of trauellers, wherein they might easily bee mistaken. For instance wee will take <hi>Era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tosthenes</hi> and <hi>Possidonius,</hi> as of greatest credit, who are notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing taxed for many errours in their experimentall obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations: whereas it is cleere that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> grounded his opinion on the distances of the places, exactly measured, as is witnessed by his designation of the Latitude of the earth so farre as it was discouered and knowne. <hi>Eratosthenes,</hi> for mistaking in the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of distances, is much taxed by <hi>Hyparchus,</hi> as we find in <hi>Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo</hi>: For betwixt <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Carthage,</hi> hee reckons aboue 13 thousand furlongs, whereas by a more diligent enquiry

Let the circuit of the Earth be conceaued to be BCD (as we see in this Figure) in which let there be chosen an high Mountain whose Altitude AB may bee knowne by the rules of measu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring altitudes: then from the Mountaines top A, by the rules of measuring longitudes must the whole space of Sea or Land bee measured so far as it can be seene: so that the visuall Beame AC, may touch the Superficies of the Earth in C: let the space the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which is seene in the Earth be BC, which although in it selfe it bee crooked and not plaine, yet can it not sensibly differ from a Plaine, for as much as the Arch BC, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:8020:109"/>
little, if compared with the whole Earth. These grounds thus laid, we must proceed by a Geometricall manner of argumentation in this sort, Here are to bee obserued foure right lines: whereof the first is AB, the heigth of the mountaine obserued: the second is the visuall Ray AC: the third AD con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of the height of the mountaine, and the Diameter of the Earth. The fourth BC, the distance which is seene: for (as wee haue shewed) it may without sensible errour bee taken for a right line. Now for as much as AB, BC are knowne, their Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drates by the 47 proposition of the first of <hi>Euclide,</hi> will also bee knowne, which being equall to the square of AC, the square of the right line AC will likewise bee knowne. But the square of the right line AC, sith it toucheth the circle, will be equall to a Right Angle Figure contained vnder DA, AB, wherefore the right angle so conceaued will be knowne. But AB is the knowne heigth of the mountaine, wherefore the right line AD will easily be knowne; if wee diuide the knowne right Angle contained vnder AB, AD: by the right line AB: for the Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient will giue the right line AD; from which if wee subduct AB, the knowne height of the mountaine: then will remaine the Diameter of the Earth BD, which was here to be perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: from this inuention will arise this Corollary.</p>

The Greater is a Hemispheare which ariseth out of one only circle by it selfe, without the Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of more. Such are chiefly of three sorts. The first is made by the Equatour: which diuides the whole Globe into the north and the South Hemispheare. The second is of the Meridian, whose office it is to part the Earth into the Easterne and We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterne Hemispheares: The third of the Horizon, which diuides the Spheare into the vpper and lower halfes: But these parts arising (as I said) out of one only circle, are handled before with the circles themselues. In this place wee are to speake of such parts, as arise out of the Combination and respect of circles one with another. Such as are the Zones, Climats, and Parallels. A Zone signifies as much as a girdle or band: because by it the spaces in the Earth are (as it were) with larger bands compas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed about.

These temperate Zones included betwixt the Tropicks and the Polar circles are twofold as the circles: The northerne temperate Zone comprehended of the Tropicke of <hi>Cancer</hi> and the <hi>Articke</hi> circle, containes in it the vpper and higher part of <hi>Africke,</hi> stretching euen to the mountaine <hi>Atlas:</hi> Moreouer in it is pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced all <hi>Europe,</hi> euen to the Northerne Ilands in the <hi>Articke</hi> Zone, and a great part also of <hi>Asia</hi>: the other temperate Zone lying towards the South, is not so well knowne being farre di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from our habitation: and awaiting as yet the farther indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry of our <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Nauigators.

The inuention of the quantity of the Zones before mentioned, may briefly thus bee performed. The latitude of the torrid Zone is so much as the distance betwixt the Tropickes, which is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stronomically grounded on the greatest declination of the Sunne being doubled: This declination being by <hi>Clauius</hi> and others found to be 23 degrees 30 scrup. which being doubled will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce 47: which againe multiplied by 60, and resolued into miles, will amount to 2820: though the odde scruples of many Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors are neglected.

The inuention of the latitude of the temperate Zones depends from the subtraction of the distance of the Poles of the Eclipticke, from the Equatour: that is from the greatest declination of the Sunne being doubled from the whole quadrant: in which subduction the residue will be 43, to which will answer 2580 Italian-miles.</p>

time of the Artificiall day: because at the point of euery climate truely taken, the longest day is varied halfe an houre: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though this account agree not altogether with <hi>Ptolomie,</hi> and the ancient Geographers before him, as wee shall shew hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. This distinction of the Terrestriall Spheare into <hi>Climates</hi> is somewhat a more subtile distinction then the former by Zones; for as much as that is made by the combination of such Parallels as are principally named and of chiefe note, as the Tropicks and Polar circles. But this indifferently respects all without difference. This first beginning and measure, as well of this as all other measures of the earth is the Equatour, for that which is most perfect and absolute in euery kinde ought to be the measure of all other. But yet wee must vnderstand, that although wee beginne our account of the Climats from the Equatour; yet the Equatour it selfe makes no Climate, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Parallels which are thereunto correspondent. For as it is before shewed, vnder the Equatour it selfe, the artificiall dayes are all equall in length, containing only twelue houres: wherefore beginning from the Equatour betwixt that and the third Parallell, wee count the first climate: from the third to the sixt, the second Climate: and so all the rest, making the number of the Climates double to the number of the Parallels; so that one and the selfe same Parallell, which is the end, and bound of one Climate is the beginning of the next; whence wee see that to the constitution of euery Climate three Parallels concurre, whereof two are extreame, comprehending the bredth of the said Climate, and one diuiding it iust in the midst. A Parallell therefore differs from a Climate, as a part from the whole, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one circle correspondent to the Equatour, whereas a Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate is a space contained in three Parallels. Secondly, as a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell is conceaued to adde to the artificiall day one quarter or fourth part of an houre; so a Climate makes halfe an houre; so that by how much any Climate is distant from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatour, by so many halfe houres the longest day of that Climate goes beyond the longest day of the place vnder the Equatour. These Climates therefore cannot bee all of one e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall quantity; because the Equatour is a greater circle, and
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:8020:115"/>
comprehends the greatest space in the Earth: so that it must needs follow that these Climates neere the Equatour being made by the combination of greater circles are greater then those neerer the Poles. But because all Climates are made by the combination of Parallels; wee are to vnderstand that there are three sort of Parallels to bee knowne in <hi>Cosmographie:</hi> The first are those which doe distinguish the latitude of places, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king their beginning from the Equatour; and are in an ordinary Globe of Mappe distinguished, sometimes by 10, sometimes by 15 degrees. The second kinde of Parallels are those that make the Zones, which are indeed some speciall named Parallels, as the Tropicks and the Polar circles: The third sort are called Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificiall Parallels; because they shew the distances of artificiall dayes and nights, which are commonly noted in the margent of a Geographicall Mappe, which last sort of Parallels are here chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fly to be vnderstood.</p>

part of the Earth: According to the latter consideration the ancient Geographers haue otherwise distinguished the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates then the new writers: whence ariseth a great difference and confusion amongst them, in defining the number of the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates. For sometime they will haue a new climat put whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the day increaseth a quarter of an houre: sometimes at halfe an houre, sometimes at difference of an whole houre or day. But the doubt is easily answered, and reconciled by our former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction; for whereas they put the difference of climates to be halfe an houre, it is to be vnderstood of these which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per climates betwixt the Equatour and the Polar circle, for it is certaine that beyond this circle the artificiall day increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, not only by houres, but by dayes, weeks, months; so that another account must bee made of such climats then of the former. But it hath been generally taken for those climates of the Ancients: now the distinction of climates amongst the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients is of two sorts. The first was of the Geographers before <hi>Ptolomy</hi> who placed the vttermost bound Northward in the 25<hi rend="sup">th</hi> degree of Latitude or Eleuation, and so made only seuen climates. These 7 climates were all vnderstood to bee in the habitable parts wherein they were marked and designed out vnto vs by names taken from <hi>Citties, Mountaines, Regions,</hi> and such like remarkable places, where we are to conceaue that cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate as neere as may bee guessed to runne through the middle of any such Region, whereof it taketh its name: But the better to vnderstand the Distinction of the climates, as well with the Ancient as Moderne Cosmographers, we will insert this follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Theorem.</p>

                           <p>This hath been before mentioned: but for better distinction we haue reserued the handling of these differences to this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position,
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:8020:117"/>
which may serue as a Carollary to the rest. First wee take it as granted that <hi>Ptolomy</hi> so appointed the Parallells (out of which the climates must arise) that he numbred 38 both wayes from the Equatour: to wit, 38 towards the South, and so many towards the North. These Parallels he so distingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed, that 24 he numbred by quarters of houres, foure by halfe houres, foure by whole houres, and six by whole months. Hence is it that Geographers say, that a new Parallell is to be placed sometimes whereas the longest day increaseth by a quarter of an houre; sometimes where it increaseth by a halfe, sometimes by a whole houre, sometimes by a whole moneth. The first is to be vnderstood of those 24 Parallels which were deliuered by the Ancients before <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> The second, third, and fourth of such as were vnknowne vnto those Ancients before <hi>Ptolomy.</hi> To reduce all into order we will set downe this distinction. The distinction of the Climats is either ancient or new. The Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent was againe twofold: either former or latter. The former was that which was set downe before <hi>Ptolomies</hi> times, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there were assigned seuen Climates according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon opinion (though <hi>Mercator</hi> grants but 5) These Authours placed their Northerne bound in the 25 degrees or eleuation: The later distinction was almost the same, but somewhat corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who placed 9 Climates towards the North. The first passed by <hi>Meroe</hi> a Citty of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> where the longest or Solstitiall day is 13 houres. The second by <hi>Siene</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where the longest day is 13 ½: The third by <hi>Alexandria</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> where the longest day is 14 houres, the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> by the Iland of <hi>Rhodes,</hi> where the longest day is of 14 ½. The fift by <hi>Rome,</hi> where they haue the length of the longest day 15 houres. The sixt by <hi>Pontus,</hi> where the longest day is 15 ½ houres. The seauenth by the mouth of <hi>Boristhenes</hi> where the longest day is of 16 houres. Neuerthelesse some haue drawne the 6 Climate by <hi>Boristhenes</hi> in <hi>Sarmatia,</hi> and the sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth by the <hi>Riphaean</hi> mountaines. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> to this number addes two more, and so reckons them that the 8 should passe by the <hi>Riphaean</hi> mountaines, and the 9 by <hi>Denmarke</hi> where the day at longest is 17 houres. To these Northerne Climats they

The perfect distinction of the Climates is againe (as later writers speake) either certaine or vncertaine. The certaine they call that wherein the Climates are distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished and ranged from the Equatour to the Polar circle: For sithens the Northerne Regions are now discouered beyond 70 degrees of the <hi>Eleuation</hi> of the Pole, and a Climate is defined to bee a space comprehended betwixt three Parallels in the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitable Earth: wherein the length of the longest day is increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by halfe an houre; Therefore it must needs be, that from the Equatour to that habitable part of the Earth, wherein the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest day is 24 houres (which is not farre from the Pole-circle) there should be placed 24 Climates. The vncertaine distinction they call that which is betwixt the <hi>Polar</hi> circle, and the <hi>Pole</hi> it selfe, which may bee tearmed <hi>Improper</hi>; because in these Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates the day is not increased by halfe houres, as in the former, but first by whole <hi>Dayes,</hi> then by <hi>We<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Towards the South in the same La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, are placed the <hi>Brasilians,</hi> the <hi>Peruuians,</hi> the <hi>Iauans,</hi> with many others. The Accidents which happen vnto these Nations are these, 1. They may see all the starres except a few which are neere the Pole. 2. Their dayes and nights are some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what vnequall, so that their longest day, or longest night, is not alway of the same quantity. 3. Twice in the yeare they haue the Sunne-verticall, but without the <hi>Equatour.</hi> 4. They haue two Summers, and two Winters, but not equally tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. 5.

To them appeare all the starres comprehended in one of the circles, but none of the other. As for example, to those inhabiting the Tropicke of <hi>Cancer,</hi> the starres included within the Articke Circle alwayes appeare, but neuer those which are in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarcticke: likewise to those which dwell vnder the Tropicke of <hi>Capricorne,</hi> all the starres appeare which are contained within the Antarticke Circle, but none of those included within the Articke Circle. 2. By how much neerer the Sunne approa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth to their Zenith or Verticall point, by so much are their dayes lengthened; and by how much farther it goes off, by so much are they shortned: so that they inioy then their longest day, when the Sunne directly passeth by their Zenith. 3. To them the Sunne is verticall but once in the yeere: to wit, to those vnder the Tropicke of <hi>Cancer,</hi> when the Sunne enters into the signe; as to the other when it toucheth the first Degree of <hi>Capricorne.</hi> 4. They haue but one Summer and one Winter throughout the yeere.</p>
                           <p>The third sort, are such inhabitants as dwell in one of the temperate Zones betwixt the Tropicke and the Polar Circles from 24. Degrees of eleuation, to 66. Degrees, 30. Scruples. Such inhabitants towards the North, are (as wee haue shewed) almost all the inhabitants of <hi>Europe, Asia maior,</hi> and part of <hi>Africa:</hi> as on the other side towards the South, the <hi>Chylienses,</hi> the farthermost <hi>Africans,</hi> and those that dwell neere the straits of <hi>Magellane.</hi> Their properties are chiefly these, 1. Many starres are by them alwayes seene, and many neuer appeare. 2. Their dayes notably differ in inequality. 3. The sunne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer arriues at their Zenith, but is alwayes on the South of those which inhabite betwixt the Tropicke of <hi>Cancer,</hi> and the Articke Circle, and alwayes on the North side of such as dwell in the opposite temperate Zone. 4. They haue in the
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:8020:121"/>
yeere but one Summer and Winter, but by reason of the diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of places much vnequall: for where the eleuation of the Pole is greater, the winter is much harder; but where it is lesser it is more temperate.</p>
                           <p>The fourth kinde of inhabitants, are those which reside vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Polar Circle, (which is their Zenith) where the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Zone endes, and the cold beginnes: where the eleuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Pole is beyond 66.

The accidents belonging to them are these, 1. Those which inhabite vnder the Arcticke Circle, see all the starres in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded within the Tropicke of <hi>Cancer,</hi> but neuer those with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Tropicke of <hi>Capricorne:</hi> Likewise, those which liue vnder the Antarcticke Circle, see all the starres within the Tropicke of <hi>Capricorne,</hi> but neuer those within the other Tropicke of <hi>Cancer.</hi> 2. Their longest day at Midsummer is 24. houres, their night then being but a moment: likewise their longest night, as at Mid-winter, is but 24. houres, their day passing not a moment. 3. The Center of the Sunne euery yeere twice toucheth at their Horizons. 4. The Sunne at Noonetide is alwayes on the South of those which dwell vnder the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cticke Circle, except it bee in the Summer Tropicke, when it is the Mid-night, or Northerne point: likewise to those that are vnder the Antarcticke Circle, the Sunne at noone is alwayes on the North side, except vnder the Winter Tropicke. 5. They haue in the yeere one Winter and one Summer: but the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter farre colder, and the Summer slacker then in the forenamed places.</p>

Whether there were any Antipodes or no, was made a question amongst the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, in so much that Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in his booke <hi>de ciuitate Dei,</hi> and <hi>Lactantius</hi> in his third booke of <hi>Institutions,</hi> seemes stiffely to defend the contrary: which opinion is supposed to grow out of their contempt or neglect of <hi>Mathematicall</hi> stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, in those ages wherein the zeale to religion was most vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessarily opposed to Philosophie, and the mistresse forsaken of her best hand-maides: which ignorance of the Ancients was so farre deriued to posterity, that in the yeere of our Sauiour 745 one <hi>Boniface</hi> Bishop of <hi>Mens,</hi> was accused before the Pope <hi>Zachary Virgilius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salisburg,</hi> for heresy, in that hee, auerred there were Antipodes: The matter being first preferred to the King of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> and an appeale made vnto the Pope, it happened that the honest Bishop for this assertion, was flatly condemned for hereticall doctrine, and inforced to recant his opinion: yet is it wonderfull how such matters were thus deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: for granting these two easie grounds. First that the earth is <hi>Sphericall,</hi> a proposition proued in their time; 2 That euery place, or at least two opposite places in the Terrestriall Spheare may bee habitable; it must of necessity follow, that such Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>podes must bee granted: which makes me to imagine that Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> absolutely and grossely denied not the <hi>Antipodes</hi>; because in setting downe the premises and grounds of our opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, hee seemed to vnderstand them too well to deny a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary induction, being a man of so great a wit and apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: but questionlesse he thought that the Torrid Zone, which by most of the Ancients in his time, was reputed vnhabitable and vnpassable, no man had yet set his foot in those remote

parts beyond the line: so that it seemed in him not to arise out of ignorance of the constitution of the earthly Globe: but out of the receaued opinion of the Torrid Zone, and the vast Ocean: the one of which hee held vnhabitable, the other vnpassable: from whence also sprang vp an argument, or rather an idle fancie, that the Antipodes could not be admitted without granting another Sauiour, and another kinde of men besides <hi>Adams</hi> posterity: for if this coniecture had not taken place, the Pope (I suppose) would neuer haue proued himselfe so ridiculous a Iudge, as to haue condemned <hi>Virgilius</hi> for heresie.

                        <p>To vnderstand the better the Longitude, we must consider that it may be taken two wayes: either <hi>Generally,</hi> or <hi>Specially</hi>: In the former sense it is taken for the Distance of the whole Earth, stretched from the West vnto the East, and contrariwise from East to West. The bounds or limits of this Longitude were by <hi>Ptolomie</hi> and the ancient Cosmographers set no farther distant then the halfe circle, containing 180 degrees; because the rest of the Earth lay at that time vndiscouered. The end of this space towards the East, was the Kingdome of <hi>China,</hi> at the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thest part of all <hi>India,</hi> distant, as wee said, from the <hi>Fortunate</hi> Ilands where <hi>Ptolomie</hi> placed the first Meridian, 180 degrees: which being taken in the Meridian, and resolued into Miles, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our former rules, will giue 10800 <hi>Italian</hi> miles: but this space delineated out by the Ancients, was very scant and narrow in respect of the other parts since found out, being added to the former. For beyond the bound set by <hi>Ptolomie</hi> in the East, it is manifest that 60 degrees are found out and made knowne.

More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer towards the West, beyond the <hi>Fortunate Ilands,</hi> it is knowne to stretch to the farthest border of <hi>America</hi>; so that 340 degrees of the earth is fully detected, if not all the rest be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only 20 degrees, which are only deficient to make vp the whole circle. Which wee may the sooner credit; because our times haue brought forth (for ought any Authors haue related) the most excellent Nauigators of all ages, which haue say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the vast Globe of the Earth round about, and left behinde them a foundation whereon others might easily build.

This then must be the bound from whence wee must beginne our account; The subiect wherein the number of degrees may bee taken, may bee the Equatour or Parallell. Whence by some the Longitude of a place is defined to bee an Arch of the Equatour or Parallell in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted betwixt the first Meridian and the verticall point of the place proposed: so that by necessary consequence, such places as are subiect to the same Meridian, in the same Hemispheare, Easterne or Westerne, haue the same Longitude, which is the distance from the point of the West: but places declining more towards the East haue the greater Longitude; but neerer to the West, les<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>This is without difficulty to be vnderstood, out of the change of Longitudes, seconded by their trauell, varying perpetually the quantity of the day: for it is manifest, that hee who from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny place assigned saileth Eastward mouing continually against
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:8020:130"/>
the motion of the Sunne, will shorten somewhat of his day; taking away so much from it, as his iourney in proportion of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, hath opposed and anticipated in the time the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnall course of the Sunne: so that daily gaining something from the length of the day, which must bee elsewhere recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penced. It must needs be, that in the whole circuite of the earth, it will amount to 24. houres, correspondent to the whole cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuite of the Sunne, and the compasse of the earth, which will make another day: Likewise, if we suppose another in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passing about the earth, to goe Westward, it cannot bee otherwise imagined, but that seconding the course of the Sunne, by his owne iourney; hee will daily adde some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to the length of his day, answerable to his distance, from the place wherein hee began to follow the Sunne in his course from East to West. The daily addition to the length of the day, proportionall to the longitudes which he changeth, (the Sunne running a like course) must daily diminish somewhat of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urnall course of the Sunne, and so at his iourneyes end, which was supposed to be the whole circuite of the earth, answerable to 24. houres in the Sunnes course, it will loose a whole day. To demonstrate both these cases, wee will imagine in supposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that of these two trauaillers going the one Eastward, the other Westward, the former should take away from the length of the day, or the latter adde to it for euery 15. miles one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute.

These three men then, meeting together againe after a yeere, two, or three, at the same place, must needs make a diuers account; for one and the selfe-same day, will bee to the <hi>Sarazen</hi> Friday, to the <hi>Iew</hi> Saturday, and to the <hi>Christian</hi> Sunday, if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly calculate the time from their first meeting, to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne vnto the same place. Mee thinkes this, if there wanted other Arguments, were a reason sufficient to conuince some strait-laced men, who rigidly contend our Lords day (which they erroneously tearme the Sabboth) to bee meerely morall, as grounded on the Law of nature. If it were so, according to our premises before demonstrated, this absurditie would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue necessarily: That the Morall Law, which they call also in a sort the Law of nature, is subiect to manifold mutation, which by our best Diuines is vtterly denied.

Neither at this day can any man exactly and precisely obserue any one day, either as it was first appointed by <hi>Moses</hi> in the <hi>Leuiticall</hi> Law, as it was instituted by Christs Apostles afterwards; by reason of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold transportation of colonies, and transmigration of Nations from one Region into another, whereby the times must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily bee supposed to vary.

But if there be a difference in the time, then must there be a difference in the longitude, which to finde out, you may in this sort proceed: Take the lesser summe of houres out of the greater, and there will be remaining, either houres or minutes, or both: If there remaine houres, then multiply the same by 15; if minutes, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide the same by 4; (for in this account as wee haue taught, 15. Degrees make an houre) and adde the difference so found vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the longitude, if the Ecclipse appeare there sooner: but if later, subtract it from the longitude formerly knowne. If there remaine any minutes after the diuision, you must multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply those minutes by 15; and so shall yee haue the Minutes of Degrees. To explaine this the better, wee will take this famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar example from some of our later writers. The longitude of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris</hi> was set downe by <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> to be 23 degrees; now we may be informed by an Ephemerides, that a certaine Eclipse of the Moone beginnes there 3 houres after midnight; out of this I would willingly learne the longitude of <hi>Tubing</hi> a towne in <hi>Sueuia:</hi> In this towne I obserue by some Astronomicall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at what houre the Eclipse there beginnes, which I finde to bee at three of the clocke and 24 minutes after midnight. Then by the subraction of the lesser number of time out of the greater, I finde the remainder to be 24 minutes, which diuided by 4. which makes one degree, the quotient will bee 6. degrees: and that is the difference, which if you adde to the knowne longitude of <hi>Paris</hi> (because the Eclipse begins there sooner then at <hi>Paris</hi>) it will amount to 29 degrees: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may collect that the Longitude of <hi>Tubing</hi> is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But exact Astronomers cannot be so easily found in euery citie, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we desire to know the longitudes; or if there were such, they keepe not alwaies such correspondency in friendship; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is an Eclipse of the Moone alwayes at command.

Wee will imagine O to be the place of the Moone, as seated in the lower Orbe; G to bee the place of the fixt starre, whose distance from the Moone is inquired: E and F two stations and habitations of men dwelling on the earth, whereof wee may imagine the one to bee in <hi>Europe,</hi> the

                                 <pb n="244" facs="tcp:8020:134"/>

other in <hi>America:</hi> It will be manifest that the inhabitant situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate in F will behold the Moone in the point B; and the said fixt starre in G: (because as the <hi>Optickes</hi> teach vs, all things are seene in the places opposite to the eye) so that the distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Moone and the said starre, will bee the Arch of the greatest Circle BG of the other side: the inhabitants situate in E, will behold the Moone by the ray EC in C. as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the said fixt starre G in the point G, by the ray EG: so that the distance betwixt the Moone and the fixt starre, will bee in that station the Arch of the circle CG. Now by the first common <hi>Axiome</hi> of <hi>Euclide,</hi> euery man must grant that the Arch of BG is greater then CG, the former being the whole, and this the part. Secondly, out of the same ground, wee may as easily collect that this distance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Moone and some other knowne fixt starre is varied proportionally, according to the distances of the places on the earth, because so many places as there are, so many di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersity
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:8020:134"/>
of aspects will arise, being increased or diminished, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the distances of places on the Terrestriall Globe: This conclusion thus demonstrated, wee must proceed to pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in this manner, as is taught by <hi>Gemma Frisius:</hi> First, it behooueth you to search out by the helpe of <hi>Astronomicall</hi> Tables, the true motion of the Moone, according to the Longitude, at that time of your obseruation at some certaine place, for whose <hi>Meridian</hi> the rootes of those Tables are calculated. 2. You must know the Degree of Longitude of some fixed starre, nigh vnto the Eclipticke, either preceding or following the moouing of the Moone. 3. You must seeke out the Distance of moouing of the Moone, and the said starre. 4. The distance once had, apply the crosse-staffe to your sight, and so mooue the Crosse to and fro, till you may behold the Center of the Moone, at the one ende, and the fixed starre with the other. So shall you see expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by the Degrees and Minutes marked on the staffe the distance of the Moone and the said starre correspondent to the place of your obseruation: which being noted, set downe also the distance betwixt the Moone and the foresaid Starre which was first calculated. Then subtract the lesser from the greater, the residue will shew the least difference: which being diuided by the moouing which the Moone maketh in one houre, you shall know the time in which the Moone is or was ioyned with the first distance of the foresaid starre. Then hauing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted that time into degrees and minutes, the rest will be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed either by addition or substraction of the Product there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to or from that Meridian: for which the Tables where by you first calculated the motion of the Moone, were appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and verified. If the distance betwixt the Moone and the fixt Starre of your obseruation bee lesser, then must you adde the degrees and minutes to the knowne Latitude, so shall you finde the place of your obseruation to bee more Eastward. If it bee greater, then substract the degrees and minutes from the knowne Longitude, and the place of your obseruation in this regard will bee more Westward. These rules are so farre true that the Moone bee supposed to bee more Westward then the
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:8020:135"/>
fixed Starre: for if otherwise, your working must be cleane con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: to wit, if the distance betwixt the Moone and the fixed Starre bee lesser, you must subtract the degrees and minutes from the knowne Longitude: so shall the place of your obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation bee more Westward: but if it bee greater, then must you adde the degrees and minutes vnto the knowne Longitude, and the place of your obseruation shall bee sound Eastward. This way, though more difficult, may seeme better then all the rest: for as much as an Eclipse of the Moone seldome happens, and a watch, clocke, or houreglasse cannot so well bee preserued, or at least so well obserued in so long a voyage: wherea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>This Rule may easily be explaned by these three precepts. First that you must turne round the Globe on his Axell-tree, till you bring the place whereof seek the Longitude vnder the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen Meridian. 2 You must diligently and exactly marke what

But if you would know the Latitude at any other day, or time of the yeere, then must you proceed in this manner: hauing taken the height of the Sunne at Noone (as before) you must by the Table of Declination learne the true degree of the Sunnes declination. 2 If such declination bee Northernely, then must you subtract it from the foresaid Alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude or height.

As the Right angle BIG is to the complement of the Latitude BG, so is IBG the middle difference of Longitude to IG the middle distance: <hi>Pitiscus</hi> in his <hi>Trigonometry</hi> to this addes another manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration, expressible by the precedent figure: let the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular IB be continued vnto K, that BK may make a whole Quadrant. Now will the Triangle IHK haue Right Angles at I and K, at I by supposition, at K by his 57 proposition demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in his first booke: because, <hi>If a greater circle of the Spheare passe by the Poles of a greater cîrcle, it will cut it at right Angles, and contrariwise:</hi> wherefore the sides IH and KH must bee quadrants: because, as hee shewes in his 68 proposition of his first booke; <hi>In a sphericall Triangle hauing more then one Right Angle, the sides subtending those Right Angles are Quadrants:</hi> Finally, because the Arches GH and EH, are the complements of the Arches IG and KE: by the 9 definition of the first booke<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                              <hi>For as much as of any Arch lesse then a Quadrant, the complement is that which wants to make it vp</hi> 90 <hi>parts.</hi> We may by the helpe of the 57 proportion of his first booke, seeke out the comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the third side GH; which will be the Arch GI: which will shew vs the probleme which wee sought, by redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing

52. Here first I subtract the lesse lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude out of the greater, to wit, 21 out of 26, and the residue will bee 5, which I suppose to be one side of the Rectangle Triangle. Then likewise I subtract the lesse latitude as 52 out of 58, the residue will be 6, which I make the other side of my Triangle, which done, I multiplie 6 in it selfe, and it makes 36, which is the square of one side: Then I multiply 5 in it selfe, and the product will be 25, the square on the other side.

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthelesse this way of finding out the distance by a Right-line Triangle, howsoeuer common and receaued, is very vnperfect and subiect to great errour, especially in places far distant: for as much as it supposeth the Meridians with the Parallels on the Globe to make true squares, whereas indeed all the Meridians meet in the pole, and so by consequence cannot make true squares: But yet this errour is far lesse in a lesser distance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in a small space of earth, the roundnesse and conuexity of the Earth is insensible, or at least of very small importance: so that this way cannot be altogether vnusefull.</p>

The Matter is the space contained; or superficiall platforme of the earth whereon wee dwell. The forme is the capability or aptnesse of it for habitation; both which concurring together are conceiued to make a place, such as wee here <hi>Topographically</hi> vnderstand: for here wee vnderstand not a place <hi>Physically,</hi> for the receptacle of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall body; in which sense the Heauens and all the elements are said to haue their naturall places: Neither yet <hi>Geometri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally</hi> for a plaine whereon a line or figure may bee drawne: but <hi>Topographically</hi> for the vpper face of the earth whereon people or other liuing creatures may inhabite. This place as appeares by reason and holy Scriptures was more ancient then habitation. For whereas in the first Masse the earth was inueloped with waters on euery side, affording no place for dwelling; Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty God is said afterwards to haue separated and parted the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from the dry land, making the one a Receptacle for Fishes, and such creatures of the deepe, the other for a dwelling place for mankind, and such creatures as breath vpon the land: yet hath hee so prouided in his diuine wisdome, that neither the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the land can well want the Sea, nor the liuing crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the Sea want the land.

The latter is as easily shewed, in that the fishes of the Sea deriue not onely their composition, but also their proper nourishment from the land: whereof wee shall haue more occasion to speake here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. Now wee are moreouer to consider, that a <hi>place</hi> may bee taken in a double sense: first more largely for any place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a creature may liue for longer or shorter time. Secondly, more strictly for such a space of earth, whereon mankinde may conueniently reside or dwell. The former comprehends not onely the land, but also the water; for experience shewes, that men in ships may for a time reside and dwell on the backe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:8020:161"/>
of the maine Ocean. But the latter betokening a continuance of habitation, is onely agreeable to the land: Which sense howbeit it be more consonant to the common vse of speech, yet for methode sake, wee are inforced to vse the former: vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing by habitation, not onely a place of conuenient resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, but any other whereon a creature for a time may breathe and liue.</p>

                           </argument>
                           <p>It was an ancient opinion (as we haue formerly touched) that the earth was not euerywhere habitable: namely, in the <hi>Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate Zones,</hi> whereof the one was placed in the middle of the earth, the other at the endes: the former was thought not habitable by reason of the extremity of heat; because the Sunne-beames there fall perpendicularly, and so make a greater reflection; The other for extremity of cold, by reason of the obliquity of the Sunne-beames, causing little or no reflection: whence a second cause seemes to be drawne from the extreame drought of those places, which seemes most opposite to mans temper, requiring a reasonable degree of moisture. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding these reasons of the ancients, it must needes bee confessed as an vndoubted truth, confirmed by experience of many N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>uigatours, that those Regions by them imagined vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit for habitation, are not onely habitable, but in many places very populous. Neither want there many reasons found out by latter writers, to mitigate the rigour of this opinion: some whereof wee haue already touched in our former treatise. First, whereas they vrge the places vnder the Equinocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to bee vnhabitable by reason of intemperate heat; wee may easily answer, that the dayes and nights are then alwayes equall, containing not aboue 12 houres, so that the space of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being shorter, the cold of the night may well asswage the extreame heat of the day. Another reason is ordinarily taken from the extraordinarily high mountaines, commonly placed vnder the Equinoctiall, which approaching neerer the middle Region of the aire, must of necessity partake some what more
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:8020:161"/>
of cold: which dayly experience can witnesse, in that their top <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> are couered with snow euen in the depth of Summer. Thirdly, the neerenesse of the maine <hi>Ocean</hi> to a great part of this Region, is a great cause of this cold temper, because water is found to bee by nature cold. Fourthly, the set and certaine windes by nature ordained to blow in the hottest times of the yeere, may adde much to temperature. Fiftly, the extraordinary Raines and showers which those places suffer, which are vnder the Line, especially when the Sunne is verticall, are a great cause of the asswaging of the heat of the Sunne. Lastly, the custome of the Inhabitants being from their cradles inured to no other qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity or disposition of the ayre, will take away much from our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration. On the other side no small reasons may bee shewed, why, the Regions lying neere or vnder the <hi>Pole</hi> should not bee so extreamely cold, but that they may admit of habitation. First, because the Sunne being for six moneths together aboue their Horizon, must needs impresse into the Ayre more heat then otherwise it would doe. Besides, the thicknesse incorporated (as it were) with heat, must needs receaue into it more degrees of it then a thinner and more refined ayre, because the intention of the quality most commonly supposeth the condensation or thickning of the subiect wherein it is. But no greater reason can bee shewed in this point then the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of the Northerne inhabitants, exposed from their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to no other temperament. If wee should aske a reason why wee vnmaske our faces against the encounter of the greatest cold, being a soft and tender part, not daring to vncouer our other parts, what reason can a man inuent but custome? If any should aske why barbarous people liuing in farre colder cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates then this of ours, goe altogether naked, whereas the cold is mother of many diseases amongst vs who goe alwayes clothed; onely vse and custome can yeeld an answer. These reasons make it probable enough, that no place of the whole world is by nature made not habitable. Now that it is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inhabitable by nature, but also for the most part truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited, will appeare as easily, if wee trust the testimony of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uigatours which haue discouered few or no Regions wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

                              </gap>nhabitants. But that this proposition may bee more distinctly vnderstood, wee must know that the whole world is diuided into <hi>Sea</hi> and <hi>Land</hi>: for the Sea we may call it habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in that large sense before mentioned; to wit, that on it euery where men in ships may breath and liue; which is plaine out of experience of Nauigatours, who haue sailed round about the Earth from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West,</hi> and haue entred farre towards the <hi>North</hi> and <hi>South:</hi> where at least some times of the yeere, or other they might finde the way passable: For the land which is here principally vnderstood, wee must note that it may bee considered two wayes; either for euery little quillet or parcell of land contaned in the superficies of the Earth; or else for a certaine Region of some indifferent greatnesse. In the former sense, it were too much to affirme euery part of the Earth to bee habitable; for as much as many places, as the toppes of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> or the sands of <hi>Africa,</hi> properly admit of no habitation; yet in an improper and large sense they may be called habitable, because on them a man may liue and breath for a certaine space of time. But if by the parts of the land wee vnderstand some reasonable greatnesse, no great doubt can bee made, but that it is either already inhabited by mankinde, or can at least admit of habitation, as that which not only for a time affords a man life and breath, but also some conuenient meanes of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stenance; for no countrey hath euer beene found so indigent and barren of all vitall aides, which is neither capeable of liuing creatures in the land, fit for mans nourishment; or that cannot draw <hi>Fishes</hi> from the Sea; or if this should faile, cannot afford <hi>Fruits</hi> or Herbage from the ground: or in case all the rest were deficient cannot haue passage by <hi>Water</hi> to other Countries, whence to relieue their necessities. And no question but nature hath stored euery Countrey with some commodity or other, which by trafficke may draw riches from other Regions, as by instances may more particularly appeare hereafter when wee shall speake of particular Regions, and their seuerall acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.</p>

But if we consider the naturall changes of Countries, sithence the first creation wee shall finde them to haue suffered as well in the naturall accidents, and disposition of the soile, as the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the <hi>Inhabitants</hi>; concerning the former wee may note a twofold alteration: whereof the one is a progresse from <hi>Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> to <hi>Perfection</hi>; the other contrariwise, from <hi>Perfection</hi> to <hi>Imperfection.</hi> The first groweth out of the generall Industrie of mankinde, which is wont to worke euery thing as neere as it can to his best ends and vse, for his owne good and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of his kinde: which wee may best finde in the first ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall of the world, the first ground-worke of ciuill society; for man being once expelled out of <hi>Paradise</hi> for his owne trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression, had left him notwithstanding for his lot the whole world besides, which no question hee found as in the cradle of Nature a poore infant, as yet altogether vnfashioned and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shaped for humane habitation. For who can imagine the earth at that time to bee any otherwise then as a vast Wildernesse all
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:8020:163"/>
ouergrowne with briers and bushes growing of their owne ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord out of the Earth: Moreouer what <hi>Fennes, Bogges, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes,</hi> and other such incombrances could there bee wanting to those places which neuer yet felt the chastising hand of hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandrie? All these incommodities, as mankind began to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plie and propagate it selfe on the face of the Earth, were by little and little remoued, and the Earth reduced into a better forme for humane dwelling: because euery man choosing out his owne possession, began presently to till and manure the soyle with all heedfull industrie. For if our first Parents being placed in <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise</hi> it selfe, the most pleasant and fertile portion of the whole world, were neuerthelesse enioyned to dresse and manure the Garden for their better vse and profit; what shall wee imagine of the other parts of the Earth, which (no doubt) a thousand de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees come short of this perfection: especially knowing this curse to bee laid on man by our Creatour: <hi>That he should eat his bread in the sweat of his browes</hi>; as though the earth were bound to open her treasures onely to mans paines and labour. And howsoeuer the diligence of mankinde hath gone very farre in adorning and fashioning the vpper face of the earth, yet hath it not waded so farre, but that many places in our times are left altogether rude and vncultered, groaning vnder vast Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses and vnprofitable desarts. For times past wee might haue for instance, gone no farther then <hi>Britanie</hi> and <hi>Germanie</hi>; both which Countryes we shall finde in these dayes to differ as much from the dayes of <hi>Caesar,</hi> as <hi>Caesar</hi> iudged them to differ from the <hi>Roman</hi> Territory; which no doubt hee preferred before all parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> Notwithstanding this generall inclination of mankinde to perfect their dwelling places for their better ease and comfort, wee shall finde many wayes whereby the parts of the Earth haue degenerated, and proued more vnfit for humane habitation then in former times. The first which is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test, and cause of all the rest, is that <hi>Curse</hi> which our Almighty Creatour cast on the whole earth for <hi>Adams</hi> sake, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward seemes renued and increased in the generall deluge, wherein all mankinde suffered for their sinnes a plague of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. For as the estate of mankind immediatly before the <hi>Flood</hi>
                              <pb n="9" facs="tcp:8020:163"/>
was farre better then that afterwards, so was the estate of <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice</hi> farre better then that: So as wee may note from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world a generall defect and weakenesse of the Creatures, still more and more declining from their originall perfection granted in the first creation. So that many great Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers haue coniectured, not without ground, that the world from the first creation hath suffered the change of ages sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly, and this wherein wee liue to bee the last and decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite age, wherein Nature lyeth languishing, as ready to breath out her last. But this opinion seemes to bee controled by reason; for as much as wee finde not a proportionall decrement and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of naturall vigour in things, as well in man as other crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. For if wee compare the estate of a man before the Flood, with the age of <hi>Dauid</hi> long after, wee shall finde a great dispa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in the proportionall decrement of the <hi>Yeeres</hi> and <hi>Ages</hi> of men: for as much as many before the Flood attained to 800, and some as <hi>Methusalem,</hi> to 900 yeeres: But in <hi>Dauid</hi> time, the dayes of mans life (as he himselfe testifieth) are threescore and ten: and admit wee vnderstand this speech of <hi>Dauid</hi> to bee meant only of his chiefest strength and liuelyhood, wee shall yet finde a great diuersity, because man is vnderstood to bee in his greatest strength and vigour in his middle age; so that the whole age of man by this account surmounts not 140 yeeres. To which proportion of defect or decrement our times can no way agree, because many men in our dayes come neere the same age, as wee see by experience, which may bee confirmed by diuerse instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereof wee will produce only two: the one of a certaine <hi>Indian</hi> presented to <hi>Soliman</hi> the <hi>Turke,</hi> being of the age of 200 yeeres: the other of the Countresse of <hi>Desmond</hi> in <hi>Ireland</hi> (which S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                              <hi>Walter Rauleigh</hi> mentions to this purpose) who was married in <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth's time, yet was aliue very lately. But to this doubt I might answer, that this extraordinary diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the ages of men, betweene the <hi>Patriarches</hi> and <hi>Dauids</hi> time compared with men, ages betwixt <hi>Dauids</hi> and our dayes, came from two especiall causes: First by the vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall <hi>Deluge,</hi> which caused a generall defect and decay of nature in the whole earth, the like whereof hath not since beene found:
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:8020:164"/>
Secondly, it was (as it seemes) much impaired by the <hi>Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> and luxurious diet of those times, which added much to this generall weaknesse of nature: for as much as the children can haue little or no naturall perfection in themselues more then is deriued vnto them by their parents. For nothing can giue that to others which it neuer had it selfe; whence it must needs come to passe, that the posterity deriued from luxurious and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempered bodyes, should proue as weake and impotent gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally (if not more) then their Parents. Now why the people soone vpon the Flood should finde their distemperature more noxious and preiudiciall to long life then the men of our age, a good reason may bee giuen; because the Earth long after the Flood had not fully receaued that naturall heat and spirit which it lost in the <hi>Deluge.</hi> So that all things arising out of it, as <hi>Plants, Hearbs, Fruits,</hi> and liuing creatures feeding thereon, proued for a while more vnwholsome and vnnaturall, then in some yeeres after, when it had somewhat reuiued it selfe by the heat of the <hi>Sunne</hi> and the <hi>Starre,</hi> and by little and little returned to his owne nature. The other cause of deficiencie is more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, as not happening to all, but to diuerse parts of the Earth, and that more at one time then another: as the neglect of due manuring many places, caused commonly two wayes; either by contagion naturally incident to diuerse places, or by hostile <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uasion</hi> and deuastation: of this latter arise two maine effects; The first is the want and scarcity of Inhabitants, which should dresse and manure the ground to make it more fruitfull and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate to mans vse. The second is their <hi>pouerty</hi> and <hi>cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity</hi>; whereof the one makes them vnable, the second vnwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to effect any great matter for the benefit of the Land. A good instance whereof wee may finde in the land of <hi>Palestine</hi>: which in times past by God himselfe was called, <hi>A land flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with milke and hony,</hi> for the admirable pleasantnesse and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility of the Soile: yet at this day, if wee will credit trauellers report, a most barren Region, deuoid almost of all good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity fit for the vse of man, in the ruines of which, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times famous kingdome, euery bleere-eyed iudgement may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily read Gods curse long since denounced; Which strange al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration

                           </argument>
                           <p>This Proposition I haue knowne to bee warranted by the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of many experienced Nauigators: in so much as I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume few men can doubt of the truth of it, who hath either beene a Traualler himselfe into farre Countreyes, or at least hath read other mens discoueries. The onely matter therefore wee here intend, is to produce certaine causes of this effect, to giue satisfaction to such as make a distinction betwixt the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the effect, and inquiry of the cause. The first cause which I can alleage is the industrie of mankinde inhabiting any Countrey (mentioned in the former Theoreme) out of which ariseth a twofold effect. 1 The improuing of the Soyle, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouing all such impediments as otherwise would proue noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some to mankinde, for whereas all things growing of their
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:8020:165"/>
owne accord, are suffered to rot into the ground; in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner what other can wee expect but Fennes, Fogges, and noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some vapours, altogether hurtfull to the welfare and life of man. 2 The profit of mans industrie is no lesse apparent in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuring the ground, and opening the vpper face of the Earth: which being composed of diuerse substances, sendeth forth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times certaine hot fumes and vapours, which in many cold Countreyes mollify the vsuall rigour of the Aire, which most offends the Inhabitants. This reason is giuen by my Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Captaine <hi>Whitborne</hi> for the extreame cold, which some men professe themselues to haue tried in <hi>New-found-land,</hi> which neuerthelesse, according to many mens description, is knowne to lye farre more South then <hi>England</hi>: for the natiues of the Countrey being for the most part driuen into the North part by the <hi>Europeans,</hi> who vsually trade there for fish, and they themselues liuing altogether on Fish from the Sea, or some wild beasts on the land, as <hi>Beares, Deare,</hi> and such like; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any manuring of the ground for herbage; The Soyle by them is in a manner left altogether vnmanured: so that neither the soyle can bee well cleansed from noisome vapours arising from the putrefaction of herbage rotting (as I said) into the ground, or left free to send out such wholsome fumes and vapours from its interiour parts, which may warme the Ayre, and preserue mankind. 3 A third reason drawne from mens In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustries, that those Countreyes which haue inioyed Inhabitants by the continuall vse of <hi>Fires,</hi> haue their Aire more purged and refined from drossie and noisome vapours, which vsually arise out of a contagious soyle, daily infected by putrefaction: for scarce any nation hath beene knowne so barbarous and ignorant which hath not the inuention and vse of Fire: neither is any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the aire so pestilent, and opposite to humane consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, which the breath of fire will not in some sort dispell. If any man obiect the distance of houses and villages wherein fire is vsed, which seeme to claime a small interest in the change of the ayre hanging ouer a whole Countrey: let him well consider the quicknesse of motion and fluidity of the Ayre, passing (as it were) in a moment from one place to the other, and hee may
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:8020:165"/>
soone answer his owne obiection. All those reasons hitherto mentioned an inhabited Region owes to mans industrie, which wee generally touched in the precedent Theoreme. The second cause which is as a consequent of habitation, is the necessity of breathing of people liuing in any Region of the earth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by may follow two effects. 1 A certaine measure of heat im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed into the aire, as wee see in any roome in a great throng of people, by reason of their breathing together in one place. 2 The assimilation of the Aire to humane bodies, by a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall respiration. These alterations of the aire, might perhaps to common apprehensions, seeme small and insensible. But hee that considers how great a quantity of aire is requisite for a mans respiration, and the space and extent of motion together with the multitude of Inhabitants in a populous Countrey, would hold it no strange matter, that the breathing of men should breed such an alteration of the aire: wee finde by experience, that strong built houses being left tenantlesse, will soone fall into decay, not so much for want of reparation, as the foggy vapours and moisture, caused by want of Respiration. The like whereof in some proportion may we imagine to be in a region wanting Inhabitants, and depriued of this benefit of nature.</p>

about it: which kind of measuring is not alwayes to be reiected: for as much as in new discoueries sometimes no other way can bee had. Neuerthelesse this manner of measuring must needs proue very vncertaine for diuers reasons. First in regard of the motion of the ship, which by reason of diuerse and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry winds, which must needs happen very frequently, cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes moue with the same swiftnesse. Secondly because the Sea it selfe (as wee shall hereafter shew) hath in diuerse places diuerse speciall motions and currents, as from the East to West; whence it must needs inforce an inequality of motion in the ship. The third reason, which is greater then all the rest, is drawne from the various <hi>Figuration</hi> of Countreyes, whose greatnesse cannot bee knowne by the circumference. Because (as <hi>Geometricians</hi> teach vs) two figures may haue one and the selfe-same circuit about them, and yet the one shall extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily exceed the other in greatnesse: as for example, let there be
<figure/>
imagined two <hi>Parallelogrammes</hi>; the one an exact square of six foot; the other a long square of 10 foot in Length, and two in Breadth. The one comprehends 36 square feet, the other 20,

as will appeare by multiplication of their sides, the one into the other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in which numbers there is a great inequality.

                           <p>The reason of this Proposition is easily shewed, because a <hi>plaine Superficies</hi> consists of right lines. But a right line (as <hi>Euclide</hi> witnesseth) is the shortest betwixt his owne bounds: whereas betweene two points infinite crooked lines may bee drawne: whence it must needs follow, that more certainty and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is to bee expected in the measure of a <hi>Plaine</hi> Countrey whose <hi>Diameter</hi> is a <hi>Right</hi> line, then from a <hi>Crooked</hi> and hilly trey, Region, where the Corde is crooked and gibbous.

                              <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It may bee here objected, that the earth is euery where crooked and orbicular, and therefore no part thereof can bee measured by a <hi>Right line</hi>: I answer that the Earth is indeed <hi>Sphericall</hi> (as wee haue formerly proued) yet may some little part or portion thereof bee counted as a <hi>Plaine</hi>; because such parts haue little or no proportion to the whole masse of the Earth. This conuexity therefore being so little, may passe for a plaine without any sensible errour. Hence wee may gather that the Land cannot so exactly bee measured as the Sea.

But the Sea euery where plaine and like it selfe, except the rising of the waues and surges, which in so great a distance will make no difference at all. Secondly, we may hence collect that of two Countreyes of the same bounds and figure, that must bee the greatest whose soyle and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies is most varyed and crooked: because (as wee haue said) crooked lines betwixt the same points are longer then right, and therefore measure the greater Magnitude.</p>

The first reason may bee drawne from the situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Earth, in respect of the heauen and Starres therein fixed. This may cause a diuersity of disposition two wayes; 1 By reason of the Sun, and his generall light and influxe: whence in the Earth are ingendred the foure first qualities of Heate, Cold, Drouth, and Moisture, whereon depends a great part of the disposition, not only of the soyle, but also of mans body: for as much as the one ordinarily borrowes his fruitfulnesse or barrennesse of these first qualities: and the other hath his vitall Organes (which are the ministers of the Soule) much affected with them; in so much as some Philosophers haue vndertaken to define all the differences of mens wits and intellectuall fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties out of the Temperament of the braine, according to these foure accidents. And what Physitian will not acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, all these Qualities and their mixture to challenge an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary preheminence in the disposition and constitution of mans body, whose mixture is the first ground of health or sicknesse. The second meanes whereby the Heauens may cause a diuersity of temper in diuerse places, is from the <hi>speciall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences</hi> of some particular Starres and constellations incident to particular places: for it were blockish to imagine that so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny various Starres of diuerse colours and magnitudes should bee set in the Firmament to no other vse then to giue light to the world, and distinguish the times: sith the ordinary Physitian can easily discouer the Moones influence by the increase of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:8020:170"/>
in mans body: and the experience of Astrologers will warrant much more by their obseruation: as assigning to each particular aspect of the Heauens a particular and speciall influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and operation. Now it is euident that all aspects of the Heauens cannot point out and designe all places alike; for as much as the beames wherein it is conueyed, are somewhere perpendicularly, other where obliquely darted, and that more or lesse according to the place: whence it commeth to passe that neither all places can enioy the same Temperament, nor the same measure and proportion. Yet wee say not that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly bodyes haue any power to impose a <hi>Necessitie</hi> vpon the <hi>wills</hi> and dispositions of men; but onely an inclination: For the Starres worke not Immediatly on the intellectuall part or minde of man, but Mediatly, so farre forth as it depends on the Temperament and materiall organes of the body. But of this wee shall especially speake hereafter. Where (God willing) shall bee opened the manner of this celestiall operation. By this wee may vnderstand how farre the Heauens haue power to cause a diuersity in Places and Nations. The second rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may bee the <hi>Imbred Quality, Figure,</hi> and <hi>Site</hi> of the Places themselues; For that there is another cause of diuersity besides the situation of places in respect of the Heauens, may easily bee proued out of experience; for wee finde that places situate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the same Latitude, partake, of a diuerse and opposite Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and disposition, as the middle of <hi>Spayne</hi> about <hi>Toledo,</hi> which is very hot and the Southermost bound of <hi>Virginia,</hi> which is found to bee Temperate betwixt both: All which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding are vnder the selfe-same Latitude, or very neere, without any sensible degree of difference: also we sometimes finde pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces more Southward toward the Equatour to partake more of cold, then such as are more Notherne, as the Toppes of the <hi>Alps</hi> being perpetually couered with Snow, are without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion colder then <hi>England,</hi> although they lye neerer to the equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctiall. Likewise <hi>Aluares</hi> reporteth that hee saw Ice vpon the water in the <hi>Abyssines</hi> Countrey in the month of Iuly, which notwithstanding is neere or vnder the Line. And <hi>Martin Frobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher</hi> relates, that he found the ayre about <hi>Friezland</hi> more cold &amp;
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:8020:171"/>
stormy about 61 degrees then in other places neere 70 degrees. Wherefore we must needs ascribe some effect and operation to the soyle it selfe: first in respect of the <hi>Superficies</hi> which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersly varied with <hi>Woods, Riuers, Marishes, Rockes, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, Valleyes, Plaines:</hi> whence a double variety ariseth: first of the foure first <hi>Qualities,</hi> which is caused by the <hi>Sunne-beames</hi> being diuersly proiected according to the conformity of the place: Secondly, of <hi>Meteors</hi> and <hi>Exhalations</hi> drawne vp from the Earth into the Aire: both which concurring must needs cause a great variety in mans disposition: according to that prouerbe, <hi>Athenis ten<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, there must needs be granted to speciall Countreyes, certaine <hi>Specifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> qualities, which produce a certaine <hi>Sympathie,</hi> or <hi>Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie</hi> in respect of some things or others: whence it commeth to passe that some plants and hearbs, which of their owne accord spring out of the Earth in some Countreyes, are found to pine &amp; wither in others: some Beasts and Serpents are in some places seldome knowne to breed or liue, wherewith notwithstanding other Regions swarme in abundance: as for example, <hi>Ireland,</hi> wherein no Serpent or venomous worme hath beene knowne to liue, whereby <hi>Africa</hi> and many other Countreyes finde no small molestation.

To this I answer, that it is one thing to speake of these Affections as they agree to the whole Spheare of the Earth: Another thing to consider them, as they are particular proprieties, and markes of particular places and Regions. In the former sort haue we) besides the Variation and Declination) handled many other affections of the Earth magne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically considered. Wee here onely speake of these two, as they are speciall markes and proprieties of sqeciall places: which it behooues a <hi>Topographer</hi> to obserue as a matter worthy of obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation in the description of any place.

                           <p>The reason of this wee haue shewne in our former booke; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the variation seldome or neuer answeres proportionally to the Longitude, as some of the ancients on false grounds haue surmised: whence no true consequence can bee drawne from the variation of a place to the finding out of the Longitude; yet may it bee of speciall vse for the new finding out of such pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces as haue formerly by others beene first discouered, so the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riation were first by them diligently and faithfully noted and obserued: first because few places in the Earth can exactly and precisely agree in the selfe-same variation; but in some Degree or minute will bee found to varie. Secondly, if any two places should bee found to accord in the same Degree of <hi>Variation</hi>; yet comparing the variation with the degree of <hi>Declination,</hi> wee shall commonly finde a difference: for as much as places agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in variation, may notwithstanding varie in the Declination.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:8020:173"/>
Thirdly, if two places should be equalized in both (as wee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not deny it to bee possible) yet the comparing of these two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gneticall motions with other affections, as well in respect of the Earth it selfe as of the Heauens, will giue at least a probable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction: of which cases it is not hard out of the obseruations of our new writers and Nauigatours to giue particular instances. Concerning the <hi>first,</hi> we finde the variation of the compasse at <hi>Cape Verde,</hi> to bee iust 7 Degrees; about the Ilands neere to <hi>Cape Verde</hi> to amount only to 4 Degrees; whence a Sea-man (if other helpes failed) may hereafter, as he passeth, distinguish the one from the other, and if occasion serue, correct this er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour. In the like sort might a man (otherwise altogether igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the place) out of former obseruations, in the same Iland of <hi>Cuba</hi> distinguish betwixt <hi>Cape Corientes</hi> and <hi>Cape S. Anthony</hi>; In that the one hath only 3 degrees of variatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, wheras the other hath 13: for an instance of the <hi>second case</hi> we will take the coasts of <hi>Brasill</hi> 100 leagues distant from the shoare, &amp; <hi>Cape Corientes</hi> beyond <hi>Cape bonae spei,</hi> which agree in the same variation: to wit, amounting to 7 Degrees 30 minutes: which notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding are distinguisht by their seuerall declination: for howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the magneticall motion of variation being of late inuented, hath not so particularly beene traced out in all or most places, yet must the declination of each place needs be different; for as much as the former hath 23 degrees of South Latitude, the other none at all lying iust vnder the Equinoctiall: since the Latitude (as wee haue formerly taught) is in some measure proportionall to the Declination. For the third, if any two places bee found agreeing both in <hi>Variation</hi> and <hi>Declination,</hi> as may bee probably guessed of <hi>Cape Rosse</hi> in S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Iland, and the west end of S. <hi>Iohn de Porto Rico:</hi> the Latitude being all one as of 17 degrees 44 minutes: and the variation admitting perhaps insensible difference, to wit, of a little more then one degree: yet might this helpe conioyned with former Trauellers report, or some small obseruation of heauenly bodies, or sounding the bottome of the Sea, settle our opinion and make a plaine distinction.</p>

Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, because fire cannot well subsist, but of some matter whereon it may worke, and conserue it selfe, which can bee no other then that which is of a glutinous substance: which wee no where finde but in the earthly Globe, consisting of Earth and Water; out of whose store-houses, the matter of all such pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:8020:174"/>
substances in the aire is deriued. These Meteors may bee deriued from the Earth into the Aire, two manner of wayes. First, <hi>Directly</hi> and immediatly, by an immediate ascent or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of exhalations from some one particular place into the Ay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie space right ouer it. Secondly, <hi>Obliquely,</hi> to wit, when Vapours, or other such exhalations are by some violence or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther carried from one place into another: as winde, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ingendred in one place, continually bloweth into another.

                              </gap>me other body different from it, I will not here dispute. This much will necessarily follow, that it proceeds originally from the Earth right vnder it. This va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour being ingendred from the water or moister parts of the Earth; is much varied and temper'd according to the place from which it ariseth: For the matter of the Earth being vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diuerse in disposition, as well in regard of various veines of minerall substances, whereof it consists, as of the first and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond qualities thereof arising, must of necessity cause the Aire about each Region to bee of the same quality. Whence a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable reason may bee shewne; why of two places, although both like in respect of the Heauens, and other circumstances, one should bee hot, the other cold; one healthie, another con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious; the one of a sharpe and thinne aire, the other of a foggy &amp; dull temper: For no question but the minerall matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the soile of the Earth consists, being not euery where Solid and hard, but euery where intermedled with a vaporous and fluide substance, must needs challenge a great interest in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of the Ayre, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:8020:175"/>
the Aire it selfe, yet at least of the accidentall dispositions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The <hi>Extraordinary</hi> euaporations, I call such as arise out of the Earth by some extraordinary concurse of the Sunne, with some other Starres. These are many times subiect to sense, which happen not at all times and places: such as are clowdes, windes, and such like, which arise not naturally by their owne accord by a perpetuall emanation, but are by some greater strength of the Sunne or Starres ratifying the parts of the earth or water drawne vp to the Aire about it. Now for the Meteors <hi>Indirectly</hi> and obliquely belonging to any place, amongst many other instances, we may bring the winde which bloweth from one Region to another; which according to ordinary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience partaketh of a twofold quality; the one deriued from the place whence it is ingendred; the other from the Region through which it passeth. Which may appeare by our foure Cardinall windes, as they are with vs in <hi>England, Belgia,</hi> and higher <hi>Germany.</hi> For first our Easterne winde is found to bee driest of all others, whereof no other cause can bee giuen, then that it comes ouer a great Continent of land lying towards the East, out of which many drie and earthly exhalations are drawn: so the Westerne winde is obserued to be very moist, because it passeth ouer the hugie <hi>Atlanticke</hi> Ocean, which must needs cast forth many watrie and moist vapours, which beget raine and showres: from the moisture of which Westerne winde some haue sought out an answer to that Probleme: why hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting hounds should not sent, nor hunt so well, the winde being in the West, as at other times? For, say they, it is caused by the moisture of it, either in making hinderance to their legges in running, or at least to their smell, being very thicke and foggy. In this Westerne winde we may also perceiue much cold, which is caused by the quality of those watrie vapours, through which it passeth, which being drawne from the water, are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally cold. In our South wind wee shall finde both heat and moisture: whereof the former ariseth from the Sunne, which in those Southerne Regions neere the Equatour is most predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant; The latter from the naturall disposition of the places because before it approacheth our coasts, it passes ouer the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:8020:175"/>
                              <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, out of which the Sunne begets abundance of watry vapours, which mixt themselues with the windes. Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally the <hi>North-winde</hi> is obserued to bee cold and drye. It must of necessity bee cold: because it is carried ouer diuerse cold and snowy places, most remote from the heat of the Sunne. It is drie; because it passeth ouer many Ilands and dry places, sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding out store of dry exhalations: as also because the Sunne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very remote from those Regions, fewer exhalations are drawne vp, which might infect it by impressions of their wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie quality. These instances may serue to proue our assertion: That Meteors, wherewith the Aire is vsually charged, and by consequence, their qualit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 <hi>1</hi> Places according to their diuerse situation in regard of the Heauens, are diuersly affected in quality and constitution.</p>
                           </argument>
                           <p>This Proposition needs no proofe, as being grounded on or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary experience: for who findes not betwixt the North and the South, a manifest difference of heat and cold, moisture and drouth, with other qualities thereon depending, as well in the temper of the soyle it selfe, as the naturall disposition of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants. Only three points will here require an exposition: First, by what <hi>Meanes</hi> and instruments the Heauens may bee said to worke on the Earth. Secondly, how farre this opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heauen, on the Earth may extend, and what limits it may suffer. Thirdly, how these operations are distinguished one from the other. Concerning the first, wee are taught by our ordinary Philosophers, that the Heauens worke on inferiour bodies by three instruments, to wit, <hi>Light, Motion.</hi> and <hi>Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi> By Light, as by an instrumentall agent, it ingendreth heat in the Aire and Earth; not that the light being in a sort an Immateriall quality, can immediatly of it selfe produce heat, being materiall and elementary; But by attrition and rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, whereby the parts of the aire being made thinner, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach neerer to the nature of fire, and so conceaue heat. This is againe performed two wayes; either by a simple or compo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded beame. The simple Ray is weaker: The compounded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring a doubling of the Ray by <hi>Reflection,</hi> is stronger and of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:8020:176"/>
more validity in the operation: and by consequence so much the more copious in the production of heat, by how much more the reflection is greater: if wee meerely consider it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Heauens, without any consideration of the quality of the Earth. By motion the heauens may exercise their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the Earth two wayes. First, by attenuating and rarefy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vpper part of the Aire next adioyning, turning it into <hi>Fire,</hi> (as some Philosophers would haue it) whence the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our parts of the ayre communicating in this affection must needs partake some degrees of heat; But this I hold to bee a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit grounded onely vpon <hi>Aristotles</hi> authority; who suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the heauens to bee a solide compact body: which will not so soone bee granted of many more moderne Mathematicians. Secondly, the heauenly bodyes may bee said to worke on inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our things by motion; in that by motion they are diuersly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed and ordered to diuerse Aspects and configurations of the Starres and Planets, whereby they may produce diuerse ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects: so that in this sense the heauens are imagined as a dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent cause, which doth not so much produce the effects them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues as vary the operation. Hereon is grounded all Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, as that which out of diuerse aspects and combinations of the Planets and Signes foresheweth diuerse euents. The third Instrument, by which the Heauens are said to worke, is the heauenly influence; which is a hidden and secret quality not subiect to sense, but only knowne and found out by the effects. This third agent being by some questioned, would hardly bee beleeued; but that a necessity in nature constraines it. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny effects are found in inferiour bodies, caused by the heauens, which can no way bee ascribed to the <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Motion.</hi> As for example, the production of <hi>Mettals</hi> in the bowels of the earth, the <hi>Ebbing</hi> and <hi>Flowing</hi> of the Sea; whereof neither the one or the other can challenge any great interest in the <hi>Light</hi>: For as much as the former is farre remote from the Sunne-beames: the other ceaseth not to moue in his channell, when the Sunne and Moone are both vnder the Earth. Besides, who can giue a reason of the excesse of heat in the <hi>Canicular</hi> or Dog-dayes, if hee exclude this influence? For if wee consider the Light of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:8020:177"/>
Sunne, wee shall finde it greater at the time of the <hi>So<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>stice</hi>; the reflection being greater approaching neerer to right Angles. If wee consider the Earth, wee shall finde no reason at all, why the heat should be more predominant at this time then another. Then must wee of necessity ascribe it to a speciall <hi>Influence</hi> of the <hi>Dog-starre</hi> being in coniunction with the Sunne. Many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Instances might bee here produced, but I hold it needlesse, being a matter consented to amongst most Philosophers. The second point concernes the <hi>Extent</hi> and limitation of this opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in inferiour bodyes: for vnfolding of which point, wee must know that this operation may haue respect either to the Elements of <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Aire,</hi> or else to the Inhabitants residing on the Earth. For the operation of the Heauens vpon the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary masse, experience it selfe will warrant; yet with this limitation, that this operation is measured and squared accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the matter whereinto it is receaued: as for example, wee shall finde the <hi>Moone</hi> more operatiue and predominant in <hi>moist</hi> Bodyes, then in others, partaking lesse of this quality. Likewise the heat caused by the Sunne more feruent where it meets with a subiect which is more capable. Whence it comes to passe that one Countrey is found hotter then another, although sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to the same Latitude in respect of the Heauens: for howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the action of the Heauens bee alwayes the same and vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme in respect of the Heauen it selfe, yet must the same bee measured and limited according to the subiect into which it is imprest. For the Inhabitants, wee are to distinguish in them a twofold nature: the one <hi>Materiall</hi> as partaking of the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, whereof euery mixt body is compounded. The other spirituall, as that of the Soule. The former wee cannot exempt from the operation of the Heauens: for as much as euery Physi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian can tell how much the humours and parts of our body are stirred by celestiall influence, especially by the <hi>Moone,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to whose changes our bodies dayly vndergoe an alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For the humane soule, how farre it is gouerned by the stars is a matter of great consequence; yet may wee in some sort cleere the doubt by this one distinction. The Heauens may bee said to haue an operation vpon the soule two manner of wayes.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:8020:177"/>
First, <hi>Immediatly</hi> by it selfe. Secondly, <hi>Mediately</hi> by the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and corporeall organes, whereof the Soules operation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends. The first wee absolutely deny; for the soule being an immateriall substance, cannot bee wrought vpon by a materiall agent, as Philosophers affirme: for the second, it may bee gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted without any absurdity: For the operation of the soule de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends meerely on materiall and corporeall organes. The Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary matter, whereof these organes consist, are subiect to the operation of the Heauens, as any other Elementary mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. So that wee may affirme the Heauens in some sort to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne mens mindes and dispositions, so farre forth as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend vpon the bodily instruments. But here wee must note by the way, that it is one thing to inferre a <hi>Necessity</hi>; another thing to giue an <hi>Inclination.</hi> The former we cannot absolutely auerre; for as much as mans will, which is the commandresse of his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, is absolutely free not subiect to any naturall necessity, or externall coaction. Yet can wee not deny a certaine inclination; for as much as the soule of a man is too much indulgent vnto the body, by whose motion it is rather perswaded then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. The third point we haue in hand, is to shew how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wayes the Heauens by their operation can affect and dispose a place on the Earth. Here wee must note that the operation of the Heauens in the Earth is twofold; either ordinary or extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary. The ordinary is againe twofold; either <hi>variable</hi> or <hi>Inuariable.</hi> The variable I call that which is varyed according to the season, as when the Sunne by his increase or decrease of heat, produceth <hi>Summer</hi> or <hi>Winter, Spring,</hi> or <hi>Autumne:</hi> which operation depends from the motion of the Sunne in his <hi>Eclip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticke</hi> line, wherein hee comes sometimes neerer vnto vs, some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times goeth f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>rther from our verticall point. The Inuariable, I call that, whereby the same places are supposed to inioy the same temperament of heat or cold without any sensible diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in respect of the Heauens; putting aside other causes and circumstances: for how soeuer euery Region is subiect to these foure changes, to wit, <hi>Summer, Winter, Spring,</hi> and <hi>Autumne:</hi> yet may the same place inioy the same temperament of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and Winter one yeere as it doth another without any great
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:8020:178"/>
alteration: and this depends from the situation of any place neerer or farther of in respect of the <hi>Equinoctiall</hi> circle. The <hi>Extraordinary</hi> operation of the Heauens depends from some extraordinary combination or concurse of Planets particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affecting some speciall place; whence the cause may bee probably shewed why some place should some <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To let passe the other considerations as more appertaining to an <hi>Astrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> then a <hi>Geographer,</hi> wee will here onely fasten on the <hi>Inua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable</hi> operation of the Heauens on earthly places; and search how farre forth the places of the Earth are varied in their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per &amp; Quality, according to their diuerse situations, and respect to the Equinoctiall circle; taking onely notice of the Diurnall and ordinary motion of the Sunne in his course. Herein shall wee finde no small variety, not onely in the temper of the Ayre, but also in the disposition and complection of the Inhabitants: both which we shall more specially declare: the former in this Chapter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the other in due place: wherein we shall haue occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to treat of the materiall constitution and manners of diuerse Nations.</p>

The whole Latitude of the Hemispheare consisting of 90 Degrees from the Equatour to the Pole, they haue diuided into three parts, allowing 30 Degrees toward the Equatour to Heat; 30 Degrees towards the Pole to Cold; and the other 30 Degrees lying betwixt both to Temperature. These 30 Degrees for Imagination sake they haue subdiuided againe, each of them into two parts contayning 15 Degrees a peece: more particularly to designe out the speciall disposition of each Region, lying either Northward or Southward from the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quatour, which is the bound betwixt both Hemispheares.

The first is, that the Sun is higher in this orbe in respect of those vnder the Equatour, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth more swiftly from them, spending on them onely twelue houres, whence so great an impression of heat cannot bee made as in other places: for heat being a materiall quality, must ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:8020:182"/>
require some Latitude of time to bee imprest into the ayre, or any other subiect. From the Diminution of heat in the Region must the ayre needs receaue into it selfe the contrary quality of cold. An argument of cold may bee drawne from the testimony of <hi>Alvarez</hi>; who affirmes the waters there in the month of Iune, to bee frozen ouer with Ice, the South winde blowing. The second cause is by iudicious writers, ascribed to the subtility and rarity of the Aire vnder the Equinoctiall line, which cannot rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>aue into it selfe so many degrees of heat as the thicke and grosse aire of diuers places distant. For the North Region, wherein <hi>Europe,</hi> and a great part of <hi>Asia</hi> is placed, is for the most part full of waters, which bursting out of secret and vnknowne concauities, doe produce infinite <hi>Fennes, Gogges, Lakes,</hi> and <hi>Marishes,</hi> which in the Summer season cause infinite vapours to abound, which being intermixed with heat, scorch and heat more feruently then the purer ayre of <hi>Africke,</hi> being for the most part free from the mixture and concurse of such slimie vapours. That the aire being thickned should yeeld a greater feruour, euery man out of ordinary experience can frame to himselfe an argument: For wee see Fire and Heat be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incorporated (as it were) in the Steele or Iron, to burne and heat more then in Aire or Wood. The like reason some would draw from the keepers of Sto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

Another cause (which we haue formerly touched) may bee drawne from the <hi>Set</hi> and Anniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>windes which blow most part of the yeere one way. <hi>Iosephus Acosta</hi> obserues that betwixt the Tropicks, the winde is for the most part Easterly, beyond Westerly: and a Dutch-disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerer hath related that in <hi>Guinea</hi> they haue a certaine winde which comes from the land till noone: and then very violent from the Sea, in so much as the Inhabitants are wont to trafficke in the morning being not able to indure it: which if it bee true wee cannot imagine this Region to bee so hot as men suppose. For here the heat in the night is asswaged, by the absence or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motenesse of the Sunne: Likewise the excesse of heat incident
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:8020:182"/>
to noonetide, is much qualified (or as it should seeme by this relation) altogether vanquished by the cold winde deriued from the Sea. Another reason no lesse probable may be deriued from the excessiue height of the land and great mountaynes, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued to bee neere or vnder the line, whose tops are alwayes couered with Snow, which giue a sufficient testimony of cold: For instance, wee need goe no farther then the ridge of the mountaines <hi>And<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This moisture is deriued from two causes; 1 From the melting of the Snow on the tops of the mountaines by the Sunne, which running from thence continually into the vallies; keepe them almost alwayes watrish, especially in the midst of Summer when the Sunne is neerest. 2 From the extreame heat of the Sunne, which being very neere, and many times verti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call, rayseth vp continually moist vapours in great quantity. These vapour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

Whence wee note with <hi>Iosephus Acosta,</hi> by way of consectary, that the presence of the Sunne betwixt the Tropicks produceth moisture, but contrariwise without the Tropicks, it is the cause of drouth: whence the inhabitants inioy as it were a Winter, when the Sun is to them verticall, because of the distemperature by Windes, Raines, and Stormes, and great Inundations, whereunto commonly all great riuers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Tropicks are most subiect. Also they seeme to haue a Summer, when the Sunne is in or neere the Tropicks
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:8020:183"/>
because being somewhat remoued, he cannot bee so powerfull in drawing such store of vapours and exhalations which hee can dispell and consume. Thus wee see the moity of this first Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction lying 15 degrees from the Equatour, how soeuer sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to a greater reflection of the Sunne-beames, yet through the concurrence of other causes to bee found indifferently Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate, and the other 15 degrees about the Tropicks, howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer subiect to a lesser Reflection to bee excessiue hot: which later cause, besides all which hath beene said before, shall bee further confirmed hereafter by the complection of the natiue Inhabitants, which wee shall finde to bee <hi>Choller-adust,</hi> the true symptome of an externall heat. But if any man shall answer that this accident is incident as well to the Regions situate vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Equatour, as to that vnder the Tropicks, I will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce another reason drawne from the colour of their counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; which vnder the Equatour is not seene so blacke and swarthie as elsewhere. For toward the Tropicke, is placed the Land of <hi>Blackmores</hi> or <hi>Nigritarum Regio,</hi> where the people are all coleblacke: which might perhaps happen also to those that dwell vnder the other Tropicke; but that other causes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpose themselues, which hinder the excesse of heat, which is taken to be the chiefe cause of this blacknesse; Here some would oppose the opinion of <hi>Herodotus,</hi> which referred the cause of this blacknesse in the Negroes, to the <hi>Seed</hi> which hee would haue to bee blacke: others would haue this blacknesse as a curse inflicted vpon <hi>Chams</hi> posterity: but these opinions carry very little shew of probability. For first, if this former opinion were admitted, it would of necessity follow (saith <hi>Boden</hi>) that <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians</hi> in <hi>Scythia</hi> should alwayes bee borne blacke, and <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi> in <hi>Ethiopia</hi> should bee alwayes white. For as much as all nations from the beginning of the world haue beene confused and mixt by the distinction of Colonies: but experience teacheth vs, that men trasplanted into another Soyle, will in manner of trees and Plants by little and little degenerate and change their first disposition. As if a <hi>Blackmore</hi> marry and beget chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren here with vs in <hi>England,</hi> experience will plainely declare the children to be more inclining to whitenesse then the fathers
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:8020:183"/>
and the grand children more then them. Secondly, if the second opinion of <hi>Chams</hi> curse deserued any credit; I see no reason why all his posterity (such as by most writers consent, are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally the people of <hi>Africke</hi>) should not bee subiect to the same execration, as well as one little parcell of it. Moreouer it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by <hi>Pline,</hi> and confirmed by <hi>Appian,</hi> that in those places are many blacke Lions, which we can ascribe to no other cause then the excesse of heat, and not to any quality of the Seed, or any curse inflicted on the place: Moreouer it is reported by <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando de Quir</hi> in his late discouery of the South Continent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that hee there also found some blacke people; yet can wee not imagine this Land, though stretching very farre in quantity tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard the Equinoctiall, to come so farre or much farther then the Tropicke of <hi>Capricorne.</hi> These arguments make it the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the Regions situate vnder the Tropicks, generally exceed more in heat, then those placed in the middle of the Earth vnder the Line.</p>

First then remouing it from A, direct your sight to F, and draw the line AF of indefinite length: likewise your Instrument be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing directed to G, draw the line AG infinitely, which by this meanes will also hit the place E: Let B also bee imagined a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine place, as a City, or Castle, situate in the very Meridian it selfe, which wee find already drawne to our hands.

                           <p>To shew the practise hereof, wee will take for instance the Region of <hi>France,</hi> an example familiar with our later <hi>Topo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers,</hi> and therefore can better warrant the description: <hi>France</hi> is supposed to haue in latitude 10. degrees, in longitude 16: This knowne, you must proceede in this manner: First through the middle of your table from head to foote, let there bee drawne a perpendicular line expressing the Meridian of the world, which shall bee marked with the letters EF: let this line bee diuided into 10. equall parts: then draw two <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallell</hi> lines, whereof the one must crosse the said line about the point E with right Angles: and the other <hi>Parallell</hi> must crosse it againe beneath in the point F with like Angles: let the vppermost <hi>Parallell</hi> bee expressed by AB: The neathermost with CD: Then with your compasse take one of the 10 parts of the line EF, which is one degree, and set that downe apart by it selfe, diuiding the same into 60 Minutes, as the short line GH, in the table here inserted will shew on the right hand. Now you may learne by some Table or Mappe, that the farthest part of <hi>France</hi> toward the <hi>North,</hi> through which is drawne the <hi>Parallell</hi> AB is 52. degrees distant from the Equatour: And that the South <hi>Parallell</hi> CD, is distant 42 degrees: Also certaine Tables in our former booke will informe you, that to euery degree of the <hi>Parallell</hi> 42. delineated by AB, doe answer 37 miles: and that to eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry degree of the <hi>Parallell</hi> CD, answer 45 miles: wherefore with your compasse take from the short line GH, 37 partes or Minutes, and with your compasse kept at the same large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, let the <hi>Parallell</hi> AB bee diuided into 16 equall spaces correspondent to that widenesse (that is to say) on each side of the Meridian 8 parts: at which Meridian EF, you must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine your measure towards either hand both right and left,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:8020:190"/>
marking the end of euery such space with a certaine point<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Moreouer for the South <hi>Parallell</hi> CD. let 45 parts likewise bee taken from the short line GH, and let that <hi>Parallell</hi> bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided into 16 spaces, correspondent to that widenesse of the compasse, eight spaces being set downe on each side of the <hi>Meridian</hi> EF: So that wee must beginne from the <hi>Meridian</hi> EF, and marke the end of euery such space with a point. Then from those points wherewith each of those two <hi>Parallells</hi> AB, and CD is marked; Let there bee drawne a right line from point to point, and those shall serue for <hi>Meridians</hi>
                              <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing as well the longitude of the whole Region, as of euery particular place therein seated. In like sort as you haue diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the <hi>Meridian</hi> EF, into 10 equall parts, so againe into the like number of equall parts must bee diuided each of the two vttermost <hi>Meridians,</hi> on the left hand and the right, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king with a point the end of euery such space, and so from point to point let there bee drawne right lines, cutting all the <hi>Meridians,</hi> and those shall serue for <hi>Parallells,</hi> and in the vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most spaces, let there bee written the numbers of <hi>Longîtude</hi> and <hi>Latitude.</hi> The <hi>Longitude,</hi> is supposed to beginne at the vttermost <hi>Meridian</hi> at the left hand, which in both <hi>Parallells</hi> is the farthest <hi>Meridian</hi> Westward. Now for as much as the most Westerly <hi>Meridian</hi> is foureteene degrees distant from the <hi>Meridian</hi> passing by the <hi>Canary</hi> Ilands, from which as the first <hi>Meridian,</hi> the auncients beganne their accompts: you must set downe in the first place on the left hand, as well ouer, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the first space 15, in the second 16, in the third, 17, and so orderly proceed through all the spaces, till you come to 30: For the difference betwixt 14 and 30, is 16: So you haue the whole <hi>Longitude</hi> of <hi>France</hi> expressed in your Table, which is 16 degrees: In the like sort to expresse the <hi>Latitude</hi> (ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the degrees of <hi>Latitude</hi> marked out) you must beginne at each end of the South <hi>Parallell</hi> CD, and so proceed vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the two vttermost <hi>Meridians,</hi> writing downe in the first space at the foot of the Table 43 degrees, on the right hand and the left, in the second space 44, in the third 45, and so vpwards along to 52, so haue you expressed the whole <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi>

For the solidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Celestiall Orbs, which <hi>Aristotle</hi> labours to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, is found long since to thwart the obseruations of <hi>Astro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers</hi>: although it may thus bee retained as vsefull <hi>suppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to settle Imagination.

                           </gap>, which signifies as much as a collection of waters: wee shall find them to haue taken their originall from the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the waters substance from the Dry-land, caused by God in the first Creation, testified by <hi>Moses</hi> in 1 <hi>Gen:</hi> which once granted (as no Christian can deny) easily rebates the edge of the opinion of some auncient Philosophers, who conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, out of the nature of <hi>Drouth</hi> and <hi>Moisture,</hi> to deriue the beginning of this separation. The drynesse of the Earth (say they) working by little and little, diminisheth, or at least resisteth the waters, so that they should not altogether ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelme the Land: But this reason is altogether deficient in Nature: Because <hi>Drouth</hi> and <hi>Moisture</hi> are no such qualities to haue such an operation: and if any such there were betwixt <hi>Drouth</hi> and <hi>Moisture,</hi> the <hi>Drouth</hi> (as wee see by experience) would rather draw moisture vnto it, then any way expell it, or driue it away: whence it is most euident, that it was effected by no other meanes then the immediate worke and proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, for the preseruation of liuing creatures: for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God said; <hi>Let the waters bee gathered into one place</hi>: the Water was said to couer the whole face of the Earth; but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards at Gods appointment, the water went backe, and shewed the dry-land. But by what meanes God separated the one from the other, it is much controuersed amongst <hi>Diuines</hi> and <hi>Philosophers.</hi> Many were of opinion, that the Earth was suffered to stand intire without alteration, and that the waters
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:8020:193"/>
were eleuated aboue it; so that if they were suffered to flow a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, they might againe couer the face of the Earth, as in the beginning.</p>
                        <p>But why the Waters should bee thus restrained, is not agreed among them: for some thought, that this was done by the miraculous power of God, which restraines the flowing abroad of the Water, beyond ordinary bounds; of which opinion is S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                           <hi>Ierome,</hi> who grounded his opinion (as it seemes) on the authority of the Scripture, especially in the 8 of the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerbs,</hi> and the 103 <hi>Psalme</hi>; where God is said to haue set a <hi>bound</hi> vpon the seas, which they should not passe: But this reason seemes not warrantable; That the great Creator of all things, should in the first institution of <hi>Nature</hi> impose a perpetuall violence vpon Nature. Moreouer all miracles are temporary, and not perpetuall; for then were it or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and so scarce a miracle: others vpon lesse ground, haue imagined that there are certaine <hi>Northerne</hi> starres in <hi>Vrsa maior</hi> and <hi>Draco,</hi> of so great vertue, that they can draw the Ocean from this habitable part of the earth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the <hi>North,</hi> and so constraine the waters, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ouerwhelme the earth: but this opinion is ridiculous, and deserues no solide refutation: being a meere coniecture, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ground or probability: others vpon the like reason, haue dreamed that there is more <hi>Water</hi> then <hi>Earth</hi> in the Globe; and that the water by his extraordinary masse occupying the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the world, turnes the earth on one side, making it to swimme as a ship vpon the sea: But this assertion wee haue refuted in our first <hi>Chapter</hi> of the first booke: All these Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors suppose that the earth is vncouered toward the North-Pole; but ouerflowne with waters towards the South: which the experience of Nauigatours at this day hath sufficiently disanulled: Others againe affirming out of a <hi>Peripateticall</hi> dreame that the water is ten times greater then the earth, suppose the earth to bee like a sponge to drinke vp the water: to proue which assertion they produce an experiment, that the earth being digged any thing deepe in most places, there will appeare water: whence they collect that the water is mixt

All these opinions seeming so absurd, it seemeth more probable to imagine, that either the Waters are <hi>condensated,</hi> and thickned, which were in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning created thinne: whence will follow, that they should occupy a lesse place, and by consequence, leaue the dry-land in many places habitable: or, which is more probable; that God in the first Creation made certaine hollow concauities and channels in the Earth, which was before plaine and vniforme; into which the waters were receiued and bounded, in so much, that they could not flow abroad. This seemes enough to satisfy the search of such as are not too curious to search into his secrets, whose power and omnipotence transcends the capacity of the wisest: In this diuision of a place into <hi>Water,</hi> and <hi>Land,</hi> wee will first treat of the Sea, and the accidents belonging thereunto: Not that the water is worthier or greater then the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The contrary whereof wee haue proued heretofore: but because the consideration of it, is more simple, as that wherein fewer mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are to bee handled then in the land.

For the prosecution of which point, I will first shew the reason of this my coniecture, grounded on experience; and afterwards out of the ground and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration of the principles of <hi>Mathematicall Philosophie,</hi> endeauour to make it more manifest. First therefore by a <hi>Coni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call</hi> line, wee vnderstand a crooked line which differs from a <hi>Periphery</hi> or circle, in as much as it keeps not alwayes an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall distance, from the center: but is higher in the midst, then on either side: Now if the parts of the water standing still, were
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:8020:194"/>
in their higher superficies exactly sphericall; they should by the same grounds bee <hi>concentricall,</hi> or haue the same center with the whole Earth: But that it hath not the same center, will appeare by little <hi>dropps</hi> of Water falling on the ground, which incline (as wee see) to a round figure; yet were it more then ridiculous to say, that this round conuexity of a droppe could bee <hi>concentricall</hi> with the whole Earth: sith in so great a masse, it is hardly sensible. But here our ordinary Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers are ready to answer, that this conformity of the water dropps in a round figure, is rather <hi>Violent,</hi> then <hi>Naturall:</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Water being by nature moist, is ready to fly, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid the touch or drouth, or any dry thing. And because the Water thus auoiding the drouth, cannot of necessity but some way touch it, it is imagined to conforme it selfe to that figure, whereit it may least of all touch: This is the round or <hi>Sphericall</hi> figure; wherein any body contained, cannot touch a <hi>plaine,</hi> otherwise then in one onely point. But against this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iecture of <hi>moisture</hi> flying <hi>drouth,</hi> strong enough is the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Scaliger,</hi> in his 105 <hi>exercitation:</hi> that <hi>quick-siluer</hi> a moist substance, being cast either into <hi>Water</hi> or <hi>Iron-Oare,</hi> will gather it selfe to a round body, notwithstanding it is manifest, that <hi>quick-siluer</hi> naturally neither auoides the touch of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or Iron, for as much as the one is very <hi>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

It cannot bee continually spread abroad: first, because experience teacheth the contrary; for we see little drops cast on such a plaine, to confine themselues within cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine bounds: and least any should imagine (as before) that this happens by reason of the drouth of the Table, let him first moisten the Table, and hee shall find no great alteration: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if the water should alwayes fall downward, and so still runne abroad, and spread it selfe to the margents of the Table, it would follow, that if the Table were of an infinite capacity, the water thus shed, would infinitely flow abroad, without intermission; and so should Nature set no bound to the thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and motion of the water: whereof experience hath suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently taught the contrary. Now, that water thus standing still on a plaine equilibrated Table, should haue a <hi>Canonicall</hi> figure, it may bee plainely proued almost by sense, whereby wee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the middle to bee higher then the extreames: for no man can deny but the water thus standing, is endowed with thicknesse, for as much as it is a naturall body. Wherefore of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity it must swell aboue the Table.

It is meet in the next place, that out of the grounds of Philosophie, wee explaine how it comes to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate this figure: where wee are first to vnderstand, that the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the water is (as it were) compounded of two spheares; whereof the first is imagined to bee <hi>concentricall</hi> with the whole Earth; the other lesser onely answering to the portion

or quantity of water, were it made round; for if wee consider the simple and particular nature of the water, wee shall find it inclining to roundnesse of it selfe, as wee haue shewed by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet such a sensible roundnesse, as cannot haue one <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> with the Earth. But if we consider the water as it concurres to the constitution of the whole Vniuerse, wee shall find this Figure to partake of a <hi>circular</hi> segment <hi>concentricke</hi> with the whole Earth. Now because neither of these two Figures can precisely and exactly arise by it selfe, sith the one must needs some what alter the other, wee must of necessity admit of a figure mixt and compounded of both these; which can bee no other then a <hi>Cone.</hi> To expresse this more plainely (because this path is yet vntroden) wee find in the water a double motion directed to this double figuration. The first whereof is that, whereby all the parts of a quantity of water, are inclined to an Absolute roundnesse, or Sphericall Figure, without respect of the Vniuerse: the Center of which roundnesse, is to bee sought in the water it selfe. The later is that, whereby the parts of the Water conforming themselues to the Center of the Earth, as neere as they can, make a <hi>Sphericall</hi> figure (as much as Nature can suffer) <hi>concentricke</hi> with the whole Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restriall Globe. In the former of these motions, the Water seekes it's owne preseruation; in the later, the safety of the whole Vniuerse: for the safety and consistency of the whole, is deriued from the part, which concurre to preserue the whole. To expresse a little better the manner of these two concurrent operations; wee will take for an vndoubted ground, <hi>That God hath giuen to Nature a power and inclination to preserue herselfe.</hi> This granted, wee must distinguish of a two-fold preserua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the one <hi>Speciall,</hi> wherein euery Body seekes it's owne safety: the other <hi>Generall,</hi> wherein all Bodies concurre to the preseruation of the whole: The former proceeds from the speciall Forme and Nature of euery Body; which is perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med by the vnion of all his parts to it selfe; this vnion is grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test of all in a Sphericall figure; wherein all the extreme parts are equally distant from the Center, admitting no Equality of dimension. The Generall depends from the Resultancy and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:8020:196"/>
Harmony of all the parts, whereby is caused an vnion of all the parts with the whole; to whose preseruation they are seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily directed: whence ariseth a double figurature of the water; the one of a Spheare, excentricall with the Earth: the other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of a Spheare, but concentricke with the Earth; whereof this Conicall figure is compounded. Why this figure should be more sensible in a small drop or quantity, then in the Ocean, may bee declared from the same ground well vnderstood; because the conuexity of the lesser Spheare excentricke with the Earth, is more; and the greater, is lesse: for by how much the lesser is the Spheare, the greater will be the conuexity: and by how much greater the Spheare, the lesser will the bee conuexity, or croo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kednesse. Wherefore this crookednesse being in a small measure of water very sensible, in a maine Ocean will by sense be hardly distinguished from a right line.</p>

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:8020:197"/>
of them; yet refuted of <hi>Aristotle</hi> in good earnest: others haue more probably coniectur'd, that this saltishnesse was first deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from the Earth, through whose parts the Water being strained, is apt to receiue this Quality, being primarily in the Earth it selfe: as wee see water being wrung through ashes, to grow salt: but this opinion seemeth of no great soundnesse; because the first Riuers and Lakes being drawne out of the Earth altogether, and in regard of their small quantity, more apt to yeeld and receiue this tincture, are notwithstanding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoide of all such Quality.

The forme is the straining and concoction, which is made by the Sun; for the saltishnes is said to arise out of the commixtion of Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>striall drynesse, concurring with moisture, ioin'd with adusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Heat: so that two things are chiefly concurring to the Generation of saltishnesse; to wit, Drouth and Adustion. This seemes to bee prooued by instance of Fresh-waters in the kit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chin, which turne salt, being much boyled, because the thinner and sweeter vapours of it are drawne vp, and dissipated, leauing that behind which is thicker and saltish. The same would some haue in the Sea, seethed (as it were) and burnt with the Heate, which we experimentally find in hot water on the fire. But this is excepted against by some, because wee find by experience,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:8020:197"/>
that many salt wells and fountaines arise in diuers places of the Earth, which are ingendred in the bowels of the Earth farre remote and separate from this extreame heate and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustion of the Sunne-beames: But to this wee may easily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, that such salt springs are either by some violence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced from the sea by certaine secret cauernes, and hollow places of the Earth: or else that they receiue their tincture of saltnesse from some salt minerals of the Earth, through which they passe. Wherefore this opinion of <hi>Aristotle</hi> I see not yet sufficiently refuted. The other opinion concerning this quality of such, which would haue it essentiall to the sea wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and inbred in the first creation, is grounded on two small causes: First they say that the sea is salt, for the preseruation of the Fishes, who would otherwise rot, because experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence shewes, that Fish will soone putrifie without salt; but this is thwarted by three reasons: First, because if fish were in this sort salted in the sea Water, the cooke might saue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe a labour in salting them againe in his kitchin: Also Fishes caught in the sea, are oftentimes preserued longer and swee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, lesse needing salt then those which are found in fresh Ponds and Riuers: Secondly, if this reason should hold cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, why should not the Fishes also rot and put<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ify in fresh Water? Thirdly, why should fishes couet the fresh Water (as wee see by experience in many fishes) if in it they should suffer putrefaction, which is a great enemy to nature; Aboue all what need wee feare this putrefaction of fishes, while they are endowed with a liuing soule, which is a greater preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uatiue then all the salt in the world; or why should wee not doubt the same calamity in all liuing creatures in the land, which are as subiect to rottenesse in the Aire, as the other on the land? The second cause (say they) Why the sea should bee created salt, is; Because the sea it selfe should not putrify, for as much as wee find by experience, that salt is the only thing to resist Putrefaction; But here wee may demaund; why these Authors should feare Putrefaction in the vast body of the sea, rather then in other Waters and Riuers, which are neither salt, nor come neere the greatnesse of the Ocean;
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:8020:198"/>
whereas <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmes in the fift chapter of the 4 booke of his Meteors, that if the Sea were d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>uided into many parts, it would more easily dissolue and putrify. The grounds of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion being ouerthrowne, there want not reasons to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict: First (sayes one) if the Sea were not created salt, then was there some time wherein it was fresh: To this I answer two wayes: First, that it might bee created fresh, yet being apt from the heat of the Sunne to receiue saltnesse, it might, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most at the first receiue it. Secondly, if I should grant that it was a long time before it embraced this quality, I know neither History to confute mee, or reason to conuince mee. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, it is vrged from the Nature of liuing creatures in the Sea, that they cannot well liue in fresh waters, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it seemes originally salt, and not by Accident: But this is of no great force: First, because experience shewes, that many kind of fishes liue in both, and many rather couet and desire the fresh Water, then the Sea: Secondly, it is not improbable, that as the Sea by little and little and by degrees turned from freshnesse to saltnesse, the temper and disposition of the fishes, was in like manner changed and altered: Whence it may come to passe, that fishes since bred and nourished in fresh Waters, cannot so well endure the salt. Moreouer who knowes whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all these seuerall kinds of fishes now found in the Sea, were from the beginning, since wee see by experience, that sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry kinds of liuing creatures dayly arise out of putrefaction on the land, which may with like probability, or more, bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the Sea. There are yet behind other reasons of one <hi>Patricius</hi> a <hi>Platonist,</hi> who would oppose <hi>Aristotle</hi> in good earnest. <hi>Aristotle</hi> (saith hee) speaking of the saltnesse of the Sea Water, shewed not the cause. For I would aske, why that parcell of water, from whence the thinner parts are extracted, should remaine salt: was it so from the beginning, or after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards imprest; was it <hi>Inbred,</hi> or <hi>Accidentall</hi>? If hee would haue it an inbred quality from the beginning, hee vainly goes about to seeke out the cause; If the <hi>saltnesse</hi> bee <hi>aduentitious,</hi> the cause is to bee giuen; but the cause giuen by him, is not true, for as much as it rather takes away the saltnesse: But to
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:8020:198"/>
these obiections of <hi>Patricius,</hi> spunne out in many words, wee may answer two wayes: either that the saltnesse is meerely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentitious bred by an exhalation, drawne vp by the Sunne, and so distilling downe againe; or else, because this answere seemes not wholely to satisfy. For as much as rainy Water is seldome salt, and if it were, could hardly flow in so great quantity to feed the saltnesse of the Sea: I will answer second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the saltnesse is radically or originally in the matter of the Water; yet so, as it cannot bee drawne out and sensibly bee perceiued in the mixture of many sweet humours, ioyned with it, without a separation first made by the heat of the Sunne of the thinner parts from the thicker: So that the Sunne is a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent, though not a productiue cause of this saltnesse in the Sea.</p>

                              <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in so much as <hi>Aristotle</hi> one of the acutest Philosophers, is reported to haue stood amazed at the flowing and ebbing of <hi>Euripus,</hi> and despairing of finding out the cause, at length en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced to cast himselfe into the Riuer which had before con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded him. Wherefore it may seeme sufficient for mee to trace their steps, who haue waded far into the search of this cause, hauing very little hope to goe further. The first opinion was of the <hi>Stoickes,</hi> who supposed the whole World to bee a great liuing creature, composed of diuerse Elements, which inioyes both breath and life: This liuing creature they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine to haue his nostrils placed in the maine Ocean, where by drawing in, and sending foorth breath, the <hi>ebbing</hi> and <hi>flowing</hi> of the Sea is caused: but this seemeth rather to bee a <hi>Poeticall</hi> fiction, or <hi>Allegory</hi> then any conceit of a Philosopher. <hi>Apollo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius Tianaeus</hi> was of an opinion, that certaine Spirits eithervn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, or aboue the Water, breathed into it this motion. <hi>Timaeus</hi> taught the cause of this moisture to be the riuer, breaking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ocean by the great mountaines; <hi>Plato</hi> thought that it was made by the swallowing vp of the Sea into a gulfe or hole which being againe cast out, was the cause of that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Sea. <hi>Seleuous</hi> the Mathematician, which affirmed that the Earth was carried round with a perpetuall motion,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:8020:200"/>
thought that the Moone was turned round with a motion contrary to the motion of the E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap>rth, and from this to proceed that motion of ebbing and flowing of the Sea, whereof wee now treat. What <hi>Aristotles</hi> opinion was concerning this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is an vncertaine coniecture; forasmuch as litle or nothing can bee gathered touching this point in controuersie out of a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny booke, which is certainly knowne to be <hi>Aristotles:</hi> for the tract of the propriety of Elements, where the cause of this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ascribed to the <hi>Moone,</hi> is iudged to be none of <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles,</hi> but of some later Authour. Yet <hi>Plutarch</hi> imposeth on <hi>Aristotle</hi> this opinion; that this motion of the Sea should come from the Sun, because by it are raised vp many windy exhalations, which should cause the Sea to swell, blowing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the great Atlantick Ocean. But thisopinion is charged by <hi>Pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 </gap>ricius</hi> of a threefold errour: 1. That it should proceed from the <hi>Sun</hi>; 2<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> From the wind; 3 That it is only in the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Sea. He saw (saith <hi>Patricius</hi>) that in the <hi>Atlantick,</hi> which he could not in the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea at home and neere <hi>Athens.</hi> For 1 No wind blowes so regularly, that for one six houres it should blow forward, the other six houres backward: for the wind oftentimes blowes many daies the same way without ceasing; yet is their not one only flowing or one ebbing in the Sea. 2. The <hi>Sunne</hi> stirres vp sometimes windes, and some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times stirres them not vp. But of a <hi>perpetuall</hi> effect which is daily, why would this Philosopher giue a cause meerely <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,</hi> and not <hi>quotidian,</hi> which notwithstanding would haue nothing violent to be perpetuall? If the Sea bee somewhere moued naturally by other motions, as the <hi>Euripus,</hi> (which is said to be his death) wherefore will he deny this motion to be <hi>Naturall,</hi> seeking out an externall cause of this effect?

I should much rather beleiue that no such opinion is to be found in <hi>Aristotle,</hi> at least that it is indirectly related: which I the rather beleiue, because one <hi>Caesalpinus</hi> a late Writer, aswell opposite to <hi>Aristotle,</hi> as the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:8020:201"/>
other hath related <hi>Aristotles</hi> opinion otherwise; to wit, that the ebbing and flowing of the Sea is deriued from a double cause: whereof the one is the multitude of Riuers bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a great force of waters into it: whence it comes to passe that it flowes only towards one pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

So that <hi>Aristotle</hi> (saith <hi>Caesalpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi>) would haue that to agree to the Sea, which vsually hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to a paire of ballance: which hauing receiued the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning once of their motion, are inclined sometimes this way, &amp; sometimes that way, by reason of the equality of the weight: for if the weight of one should ouercome, thewhole would incline thatway, and would not ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But against this opinion imposed on <hi>Aristotle, Caesalpinus</hi> not without good reason, excepts, that the <hi>Superficies</hi> of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being <hi>Equidistant</hi> from the Center (as is supposed by <hi>Geographers</hi>) no reason may bee giuen why it should incline more to one side then another, hauing once obtained his true place: sith according to <hi>Aristotles</hi> owne grounds, no violence c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="85" facs="tcp:8020:201"/>
Water will leape back to the opposite part, &amp; will oftentimes poize it selfe hither &amp; thither, seeking an aequilibration: when therefore the Earth is a litle caried forward, &amp; the water (as it were) left behind, being out of his <hi>Aequilibrium,</hi> or aquall poize, it will runne to the other part, but beyond the true poize<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> forthe violence of the motion oppressed into it in the beginning, from thence, for the same cause, it will tend againe to the opposite part, doing this oftentimes, seeking an equall weight, wherein it may rest: so that if the Earth should at any times rest from her naturall motion, the Water would also leaue off the <hi>Libration</hi> to and fro. But because the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of the Earth is imagined to be perpetuall, the libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the sea is also per petuall: so farre forth then that this motion is of the continent or Earth, it is onely accidentall in the Water, neither besides his proper nature, neither accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to nature: But so farre forth as the Water is in some sort moued in the Earth, it may be said to be according to nature: for it alwaies seekes the lower place, because it cannot aequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow the motion of the Earth. Hence they giue the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why this motion is not perceiued in Lakes and Riuers, as well as in the maine Ocean: for sith the motion of the Earth is not very sensible, it cannot be perceiued but in a great masse of waters. The reasons to confirme this opinion, besides the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of other opinions, are chiefly these two. If the Water by it selfe should be mou'd without the motion of the Earth, it must needs be moued either <hi>according</hi> to, or <hi>against</hi> his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. But neither of them can be graunted; First, if according to Nature, there would not be one only motion of one body according to nature, but many, which is denyed by <hi>Ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>stotle</hi>; If besides, or against Nature, some violent motion would bee perpetuall, which also seemes absurd: wherefore it must needs follow, that the sea should moue accidentally: For sith the Water is conteined outwardly of the Aire, internally of the Earth: And that part of the Aire which toucheth the Water is of <hi>Aristotle</hi> called <hi>Stagnans</hi> or standing still, not flowing, as that which is aboue the Earth, but is onely troubled vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously with windes. This libration or motion of the Water
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:8020:202"/>
cannot bee caused by the wind or Aire, wherefore it must proceed from the motion of the Earth. The second reason may be drawne from the quantity of tides in diuers places of the Earth, for it is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hitherto wee haue shewed the variety of motion in the sea, in regard of the diuersity of places: wee are next to speake something concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the variation of it in regard of the times, which, though it properly appertaine not to Geography, yet am I loath to leaue it out, because the discourse is pleasant. Concerning which point, the Marriners make six degrees of change in the tides according to the times. First diurnall, whereof wee speake in this discourse: The second Hebdomedary, or weeke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which <hi>Possidonius</hi> called monethly or weekely; because it is distinguished by seuerall weekes of a moneth: but tarries not till the end of the moneth: For it is found by experience of Nauigatours that a day before the coniunction of the Moone with the Sunne, and the day of coniunction, and a day after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the seas in the maine <hi>Ocean</hi> haue their greatest flowes and ebbes, being lifted higher and laid lower downe, and then the tides are most swift: The fourth day from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, the tide is lesse and lesse swift: The fift yet lesse then then the former; and the sixt day lesse then the fift: But in the seuenth day, which is a day before the quarter, and in the eight following, wherein it is <hi>halfe-faced</hi>; and in the ninth, which is a day after the quarter, the sea is, as it were, dead, not much stirring, neither much ebbing or much flowing; which was (as it seemes) only obserued by <hi>Pliny</hi> in the <hi>Euboian Euripus</hi>; but whether it so happen else-where, I leaue to men experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in these matters; This motion as it doth encrease accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the age of the Moone: So it is said proportionally to decrease againe. The third motion is monethly, which seemes in the time of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>iunction, wherein the sea-tides are highest and swiftest. The fourth is called <hi>motus semestris</hi> or <hi>six-month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> happening at the times of the Equinoctiall; differing one from the other like monethes; The fift is called <hi>Trimestris,</hi>

The fourth is from the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Iohannes Guietanus,</hi> who putting forth from <hi>Tidor,</hi> came into <hi>Spaine</hi> before the sixteenth moneth: This iourney from <hi>Tidor</hi> to the <hi>Cape of good hope,</hi> containes 55 leagues, which makes 1650 miles: from this to the Iland of S. <hi>Hele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> by the relation of another pilot are 1400 miles: from whence to the Equinoctiall circle are 1600 miles: from hence to <hi>Spaine</hi> by the computation of degrees, are not aboue 1520 miles: of all which the summe is, 7114.

Now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by how much swifter the motion of the Heauen is, by so much more is the Rarefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Aire, or other Elementary bodies right vnder it: whether it be Aire (as it is most probable) or Fire as <hi>Peripate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:8020:208"/>
encreasing neere the Poles perpetually, must haue a perpetuall current towards the Equatour, where they are againe exhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted in vapours by the Heat of the Sunne; in such sort, that as well the parts of the Sea betwixt themselues, as the waters in regard of the Aire, may proportionally maintaine themselues by the mutuall transmutation. To this reason some haue added another, that the Sunne soiourning in the Southerne Signes, is neerer to the Earth, then when hee is in the North, by the whole Latitude of his excentrice, and therefore of greater force to draw the water toward the South: But whether this Reason be of any great force, I will not spent time to dispute: let euery man vse his own iudgment. It seemes to me a conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture not improbable, that these currents may bee also varied according to diuers reasons of the yeere; as also according to diuers channels, by diuers crossings and doublings of the Tides, as wee find in diuers places: but I will not be too bold in this opinion, because I loue not to walke without a guide in these vncertainties.</p>

This wind driues the Seas from <hi>Pontus</hi> into the <hi>Egean</hi> Sea, euen so farre as <hi>Egypt.</hi> In the second place may wee range such windes as are called <hi>Chelidonian,</hi> because they arise at the first comming of the Swallowes.

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times from the <hi>North-west,</hi> so that with others it is accounted among the North windes: These <hi>Chelidonian</hi> winds driuing from the North or North-west still fill all the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> euen to the coasts of <hi>Syria</hi> and <hi>Palestine,</hi> and continue in the summer time for many dayes together. In the third place may we accompt that winde, which <hi>Columbus</hi> perceiued on the coast of <hi>Portugall</hi> comming ouer the <hi>Atlanticke</hi> Ocean, which at some times of the yeere was carried higher, at other times cleauing (as it were) to the bosome of the Sea, whence hee probably coniectured that it was deriued from some moist land, whereon hee aduentured on the first search of <hi>America</hi> and layed the first worke of that discouery.

windes may be reduced those yeerely flowings of the <hi>Persian</hi> and <hi>Indian</hi> Seas, which the <hi>Portugall</hi> marriners call Motions.

The like hath heretofore beene found (if we will credit Histories) in the <hi>Belgicke</hi> Sea, on which the Northwest windes blow with such vehemency and so long that it brake downe the ordinary banks; and in <hi>Zeland</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp many townes with infinite multitudes of people. Which seemes to be warranted by a report, I haue heard of many trauaylers, that in a calme tide the topps of towres and steeples haue beene seene aboue the water.

The second reason is taken from Ilands in the sea which are nothing else but parts of the land raised vp aboue the water. Thirdly we find by experience, that a ship carried with the like wind is driuen so swiftly from the port into the open sea, as from the sea into the port, which could not be done if the sea were higher then the land: for it must needs be, that a ship if it were to be carried to a higher place, should be moued slower then if it came from an higher to a lower<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fourthly all Riuers runne into the sea from the inner parts of the land which is a most euident signe, that the land is higher then the sea; for it is agreeable to the nature of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to flow alwaies to the lower place, whence we gather that the sea shore, to which the Water is brought fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the land, must needs be lower; otherwise the water in ru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ning thither,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:8020:213"/>
should not descend but ascend. This opinion I hold farr more probable as being backt by reason, and the Authority of our best Philosophers: yet not altogether exactly true (as we shall shew hereafter.) But <hi>Bartholomew Keckerma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in</hi> a late German writer holding these 2 former opposite opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s (as it were) in one equall Ballance, labours a reconciliation. In a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerse respect (saith he) it is true that the sea is higher, and that it is lower then the Earth. It is higher in respect of the <hi>shores</hi> and <hi>borders,</hi> to which it so comes that sensibly it swells to a Globe or a circumference, and so at length in the middle raiseth vp it selfe and obtaines a greater hight then in those parts where in the middle of the sea it declines towards the shore: Of which parts the hight suffer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap> such a decrease, that by how much neerer the shore they shall approach, by so much the lower they are in respect of the shore: in somuch that tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the shore it selfe, it is much lower then the Earth. For this opinion our Author pretends a demonstration: which hee grounds on the 4 chapter of <hi>Aristotle de Caelo,</hi> in his second booke, where hee puts downe these two positions; which he calls <hi>Hypotheses,</hi> or suppositions; First that the Water no lesse concurrs to the making of a Globe or circle, then the Earth: for it so descends naturally, that it doth sensibly gather it selfe together, and makes a swelling, as wee see in small dropps cast on the ground: Secondly the Water makes a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle which hath the same center with the center of the Earth: Out of these grounds would our <hi>Keckerman</hi> conclude the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in some places to bee higher, in other places to bee lower then the Earth: And hence proceeds he to giue an answer to their reasons who haue affirmed the Earth to bee higher then the sea: What to thinke of the proposition or conclusion we will shew hereafter, but in the meane space I hold this conclusion not rightly inferred out of these premises: For first whereas he sayth that the water by nature is apt to gaher it selfe round into an orbe or spheare, I would demaund whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther such a roud body hath the same center with the world, or a diuerse center: he cannot say that it hath a diuerse center, from the center of the Earth: First, because (as we haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrated
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:8020:213"/>
in our first part) the Earth and the Water haue but one center: and that the Water is concentricall with the Earth: Secondly from the second proposition or ground of his, out of <hi>Aristotle</hi>; if he meanes such a sphaericity as hath the same center with the center of the Earth: I answer, first that he contradicts himselfe, because he giues an instance in small dropps cast on the ground, whose quantity being so small, and conuexity sensible, can in no mans iudgment be concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trick to the Earth. Secondly, out of this ground that the Spheare of the water is concentrick to the Earth, hee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futes himselfe; for according to the principles of <hi>Geometry,</hi> in a Spheare or circle, all the lines drawne from the center to the circumference must be equall. Then must all places in the circumference or superficies of a sphericall body be of equall hight from the center, and by consequence the sea being such a Sphericall body, cannot haue that inequality which <hi>Kecker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> imagines it to haue: wherefore some other demonstati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must be sought for this conclusion. I will goe no further then that I haue spoken in the former chapter concerning the figure of the Water: Where I haue probably shewed it to be <hi>conicall</hi>; and out of this may be easily gathered, how it may be higher then the land in some places, as of the middle of greater seas, where the head of the Cone is lifted higher; in other, lower; as in the narrow streits where the increase of the eminencie is also lesse.

In which difficult passage, wherein many haue spent both their liues and hopes, it may seeme enough for me to goe with their Relations; suffering my coniecture to flye no farther then their sailes. The reasons which I meet with in my sle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>der reading, I will examine as I can, without partiality, and so leaue euery man to bee his owne Iudge. First<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then wee must co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sider that the voyage to the <hi>Indies</hi> must be effected by either of these two waies; to wit, <hi>Northward,</hi> or <hi>Southward,</hi> To beginne with the South, it must be performed two waies; ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by some vnknowne passage through the <hi>South-Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi> neare the <hi>Antartick</hi> Pole, or neare the <hi>Magellane-straits.</hi> The former is most vncertaine, for want of discoueries in those vnknowne and remote parts: and if any such passage were found out, it were litle aduantage to our Countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who haue already a shorter and nearer way: yet no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance can bee giuen to the contrary, but that this part being clouen (as it seemes most probable) into many lesser lands, may admit of such a passage: But in such vncertainties it is as easy to deny as to affirme. The second <hi>South-passage</hi> is found out by Nauigatours, which is either by the strait of <hi>Magellane</hi> it selfe, or else through the <hi>Straights</hi> of <hi>Mayre</hi> before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, which this Age of ours hath put out of doubt.

                              </gap>, is the finding out of a passage <hi>Northward</hi> to <hi>Cathay,</hi> either by the <hi>North-east,</hi> or <hi>North-west</hi>; wherein we will consider two

things: 1 Whether it be likely, that any such passage should be at all? 2 whether this passage should be performed by the North-East, or North-West. For the former many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are vrged which seeme to crosse this opinion, of a way to the <hi>Indies</hi> toward the <hi>North-parts</hi>: For The manifold attempts of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Hollanders,</hi> both towards the <hi>North-East</hi> and <hi>North-West,</hi> either altogether spent in paine or failing of their ends, seemes to giue large testimonie, if not of absolute <hi>impossibility,</hi> yet at least of the vnlikely-ho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For what cost or dangers would not almost all the Marriners of our <hi>Northerne</hi> world vndergoe, to find so neare a cut to their golden <hi>Indies</hi>? and if by chance many of them mistooke the right way, yet would it seeme improbable, that latter Nauigatours corrected by the former errours, should not after so many trialls and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, at length hit the marke. This reason sauours of some <hi>probability</hi>: yet comparing this with diuerse matters of the same kinde, would seeme to be of no great force. For the truth and right being onely one and the same, is oppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Moreouer, for ought I can find in the Relations of most mens discoueries, the passage which they sought was too farre Northward towards the Pole; where being infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A second reason against this <hi>North-passage</hi> may bee drawne from the innumerable sorts of beasts wherewith <hi>America</hi> is stored: for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this passage, we must needs grant <hi>America</hi> to bee an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.

<pb n="119" facs="tcp:8020:217"/>
whereon the Arke was deliuered of her burthen, was <hi>Asia.</hi> These grounds layed, I would demaund how such a multitude of beasts of all sorts, should be transported from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia</hi> to <hi>America,</hi> being supposed to bee an <hi>Iland,</hi> and euery where diuided by the Sea from other parts of the Earth could these silly creatures of their owne accord swimme from one shore to another? but alasse the Sea was too large, and these beasts too fearefull to aduenture on such a voyage. And admit some by Nature had bin fitted to such an action, yet were it very strange to imagine the same effect of all, being of many kinds. What then? were they transported in ships? But Naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in those daies being an infant, vnfurnished of the <hi>Chart</hi> and <hi>Compasse,</hi> durst not aduenture into the <hi>Ocean</hi> so farre out of sight of land.

Could we beleeue any man to be so mad, as to carry o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer with him <hi>Lions, Beares, Tigers, Foxes,</hi> and other innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable sorts of rauenous and vnprofitable beasts, as pernicious to mankind, as other creatures seruing for his vse? If any were found so foolish or malicious, yet were it very vnlikely hee should transporte so many kinds. This argument seemes no more to concerne <hi>America,</hi> then most Ilands of the World, wherein we find diuers creatures, not only seruing for the vse of man, but many vnprofitable &amp; hatefull to the Inhabitants: The meanes of this transportation is very difficult to finde. S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                              <hi>Augustine</hi> with some other Diuines haue bin driuen to a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall cause, as if Almighty God should performe this matter by the ministry of Angels, which answer we dare not vtterly reiect, being supported by the authority of so great a Pillar of the church: yet I cannot so easily imagine, that God who vsed naturall meanes for the preseruation of all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing creatures in the Arke, should haue recourse to a superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall power in the propagation of these creatures on the face of the Earth: wherefore to me the reason would seeme better answered out of our ground which we shall proue hereafter:
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:8020:218"/>
That Ilands were not from the first Creation, but afterward broken from the maine Continent by the violence of the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: Hence it might come to passe, that such beasts as were in the parts of the Earth so broken off, haue since there continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by continuall propagation vntill this day; I meane of rave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous and hurtfull beasts: because of the others lesse doubt can be made, but that they might be convayed from one Country into another by shipping, to serue the necessity of mankind. Here we see that no argument as yet hath bin vrged so strong against the <hi>North-passage,</hi> but may with reasonable probability be answered. It remaines in the second place that we descend somewhat to particulars, to inquire whether this be to be effected either towards the <hi>North-east</hi> or the <hi>North-west:</hi> The <hi>North-east passage</hi> hath heretofore bin attempted by many of our <hi>English</hi> Nauigatours, but with vnhappy suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse: yet were not these voyages altogether fruitlesse; foras<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as by this meanes, a way was found out to <hi>Russia,</hi> whence began the first trade betweene ours and the <hi>Russian</hi> Merchants: But that litle hope can hence arise, sundry reasons may be alleaged, the chiefe whereof are these; 1 The dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous rending of the <hi>Scythick Cape,</hi> set by <hi>Ortelius</hi> vnder 80 degrees Northward, together with the perillous sailing in those Northerne Seas alwayes pestred with Ice and Snow, seconded by diuerse <hi>Bayes</hi> or <hi>shelues, mists, fogges,</hi> long and darksome <hi>nights,</hi> most aduerse to any happy Nauigation, 2 The obseruation of the Water, which is more shallow to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>East,</hi> which giues small hope of a through passage, because all <hi>Seas</hi> are fed with waters, and for the most part are obserued to be more shallow towards the shore then in the middle: But where in sailing forward, any Sea is found to decrease in depth; it is a likely argument, that it is rather a <hi>Creeke Bay</hi> or <hi>Riuer,</hi> then a Straite; Notwithstanding these reasons, some haue heretofore gone about to proue a passage by the <hi>North-east</hi> to <hi>Cathay</hi>; of which opinion was <hi>Antony Ienkinson,</hi> whose reasons be well answered by S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                              <hi>Humphrey Gilbert,</hi> which I briefly touch, adding some things of mine own, as I find occasion. The first reason was drawne
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:8020:218"/>
from a Relation of <hi>Tartarian,</hi> who reported that in hunting the <hi>Morse</hi> he sailed very far towards the <hi>South-east,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he found no end; which might giue a likely coniecture, that it was a passage throughout. But to this we may easily answere, that the <hi>Tartarians</hi> are a barbarous Nation, altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant of Nauigation, which neither know the vse of the <hi>Charte, Compasse,</hi> or Celestiall <hi>Obseruations</hi>; &amp; therefore in a wide Sea know not how to distinguish the <hi>North-east</hi> from the <hi>South-east</hi>: Besides the curious search of this long passage must depend on better Discoueries then a poore Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sher-man, who seldome dares aduenture himselfe out of sight of land; besides, the Fisher-man iudging by sight, could not see about a kenne at sea, which will proue nothing in regard of so long a distance, The second Reason vrged by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                              <hi>Ienkinson,</hi> was this that there was an <hi>Vnicorne's</hi> horne found vpon the coasts of <hi>Tartaria,</hi> which could not come (saith he) by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes then with the tide in some <hi>streight</hi> in the North-east in the frozen Sea, there being no <hi>Vnicorne</hi> in all <hi>Asia,</hi> sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <hi>Humphrey Gilbert</hi> many waies; 1 We may well doubt whether <hi>Tartarians</hi> knowe a true <hi>Vnicornes</hi> horne, or no: 2 It is credible, that it could bee driuen so farre by the Tide, being of such a Nature that it cannot swimme. 3 The Tides running to and fro, would haue driuen it as farre backe with the <hi>Ebbe,</hi> as it brought it forward with the <hi>Floud.</hi> 4 the <hi>Horne</hi> which was cast on this coast, might be the Horne of an <hi>Asinus Indicu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The third and strongest reason which was vrged for the <hi>North-east</hi> passage was this: That there was a continuall current through the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:8020:219"/>
                              <hi>Frozen</hi> Sea, of such swiftnesse, that if any thing were throwne into the water it would presently be caried out of sight. To this we may easily answer, that this strong current is not maintained by any Tide co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming from another Sea, but by diuerse great Riuers falling into this <hi>streight</hi>: In like sort we find a strong current from <hi>Maeotis Palus</hi>; by <hi>Pontus Euxinus, Sinus Bosphorus,</hi> and along all the coast of <hi>Greci</hi> (as <hi>Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus</hi> and diuerse other affirme out of their own experience) and yet the Sea lyeth not open to any other Sea, but is main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by <hi>Tanais</hi> and diuerse other riuers: so in this <hi>North-east</hi> part may this current of water be maintained by the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers <hi>Du<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                           <p>Hitherto haue we treated of other passages, either effected or attempted to <hi>Cathay</hi> and the <hi>East Indies.</hi> The last and most desired and sought in our time, is that by the <hi>North West.</hi> This way hath bin often attempted, as by <hi>Cabot, Dauis, Frobisher, Hudson,</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                              <hi>Thomas Button</hi> and others, but as yet not found out.

Three <hi>Quaeries</hi> I must leaue for the learned to consider, and for the time to decide; 1 whether this relation of Mariners concerning the <hi>Bay</hi> of <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Thomas Button</hi> and <hi>Hudson</hi> be true or no? no man will (I suppose) censure me as vnmannerly for asking such a question, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how much many Nauigatours, either by their mistakes or their industrious falsities haue deceiued mens credulities; the one is incident to mankind, which out of vncertaine obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uations, or vnnecessary deductions, from thence often drawes an ill consequence; The other, the ordinary policy of disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerers, who lest their Trauailes might bee thought fruitlesse, would at least promise hope in the reuersion. How many rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions haue been corrected by experience of later Nauigatours, euery one may iudge. 2 Whether this strong Tide in <hi>Hud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> Bay comming from the <hi>West,</hi> were from the <hi>South-Sea,</hi> or from the <hi>North,</hi> betwixt the Continent and diuerse Ilands by an Inlet, is not a matter as yet cleerely out of doubt. <hi>Terra Del Fuogo</hi> was heretofore supposed to bee a <hi>Continent,</hi> till <hi>Schouten</hi> in his discouery found it to bee an <hi>Iland,</hi> and a large Sea beyond it toward the <hi>South.</hi> Likewise <hi>New-found-land</hi> in all our former Mappes and Globes, expressed as a part of the Maine of <hi>America,</hi> is by later experience found to be an <hi>Iland:</hi> and why may not this happen in the other, that at the entrance into <hi>Hudsons Bay,</hi> the land on the right hand should be clouen into many <hi>Ilands</hi>; betwixt which the waters issuing, should be turned in such sort, as it might seeme to proceede from the <hi>West:</hi> sith the Tides taking their beginning from the <hi>Maine Sea,</hi> and continued through some Straite, commonly follow the crooked windings of the Channell. 3 That <hi>Cali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fornia</hi> is an <hi>Iland,</hi> it may (for ought I know) be well warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: But the euidence drawne from the <hi>Spanish Chart,</hi> seemes rather to cherish hope, then perswade consent. In this which I haue spoken of these worthy mens coniectures, I haue rather expressed my doubts, then my opinion; esteeming notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing that doubt almost &amp; <hi>Heresy,</hi> which should discourage any generous and deseruing spirit from a farther attempt of this <hi>North-west-Passage.</hi>

Whence it is a probable coniecture, that this knowledge of Nauigation was discouered first to <hi>Noah</hi> at the time of the <hi>Deluge</hi> whose <hi>Arke</hi> resting afterwards on the mountaines of <hi>Ararat,</hi> gaue a president to other Nations neere bordering, in what manner shipps were to be framed.

Of the <hi>Venetians</hi> skill in this matter, we read no other argument then their great riches &amp; magnificent power, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially by the sea, which hath continued vnto this day: whereof no other cause can be thought on, next vnto Gods prouidence, then their industrie in Sea-voyages.

                           </argument>
                           <p>Necessity is vsually taken two wayes; either for an absolute need, without the which a thing cannot bee: or Compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuely for a conueniency, without the which a thing cannot well bee: In both senses I may call Nauigation necessary for a mans life: for to deferre the later, whereof lesse doubt is made; it is certaine that many places are so poore, barren, and indigent of all succour and reliefe, that they cannot maintaine a populous Nation without forraigne commerce and trafficke; especially in these dayes, where the multitude of men is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased to so great abundance: for the later, many arguments may bee produced to proue the conueniency of Nauigation, which no man of any iudicious insight can deny to bee most strong and forcible. The first argument may bee drawne from the Authours and Inuentours of it, whereof wee haue spoken in the former proposition: for first (as wee haue shewed) it was prescribed by God himselfe, who neuer taught mankind any thing idle or vnnecessary. It was embraced and cheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed by many Nations euen till this day, which no doubt had long since beene lost, had not vse and profit seconded the Inuention.

                              </gap>ansportation of commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which cannot bee administred without Sea-voyages: first because greater store of Merchandize may be carried in a ship then in a Cart, Waggon, or any other Instrument ordinarily in vse. Secondly, because in ships greater variety of wares may bee brought from diuerse places, to which a Waggon cannot without great difficulty approach, or not at all. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause wares and such commodities cannot so quickly bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uayed in the land from places farre distant, as on the sea: nor with so little cost and charges. The commodities conuayed from one Countrey to another are chiefely three; stuffes and other matters necessary for apparell, victuals and food, Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicall Druggs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all which no man will deny to be most profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the vse of mankind. Moreouer it is not to bee imagined that nature produceth such commodities onely for the priuat behoofe of some one country wherin they grow: First, because such commodities in some countries are found in such abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, that the same place seemes not to need them: And na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were vaine, if the vse were not required. <hi>India mittit E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bur, molles sua thura Sabai.</hi> Secondly, because other Nations altogether want such things which abound in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes: without the which not withstanding they cannot well liue. A fourth reason may bee drawne from the promotion of Religion &amp; sciences, which cannot well be atcheiued without Sea-voyages or Nauigation. For the former wee need goe no farther then the holy Scripture which giues large testimony of such voyages: In the old Testament as well as in the new, we haue recommended to all posterity the industrie of the Queen of <hi>Saba,</hi> who is said to haue come from the vttermost parts of the Earth to heare the wisdome of <hi>Salomon</hi>: And how should

Secondly, out of the first propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Learning into our parts; which wee shall finde (as it were) foot by foot to follow Nauigation. Hence wee see that from the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> and <hi>Chaldees</hi> it was deriued to the <hi>Tyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>; from them to the <hi>Egyptians</hi>
                              <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and thence to most parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> A fourth reason may bee taken from the necessity of transporting <hi>Colonies</hi> into forraine countryes: for as after the vniuersall <hi>Deluge</hi> of the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the people dayly encreasing, were enforced in tract of time to disperse themselues into diuerse Countreyes: so euery Countrey left to it selfe, and not much molested with famine, or deuoured by warres, will at length grow too populous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> vnable to sustaine its owne weight, and relieue its owne Inhabitants. Whence it hath been a policy practised by most Kings &amp; States in such eases, to make forrayne expeditions, and send forth Colonies into other Countreyes lesse peopled, to disburden their owne of such encombrances: as we see the Kings of <hi>Spaine</hi> to haue sent many into the <hi>West-Indies</hi>; and we at this day discharge many <hi>Idlers</hi> into <hi>Virginia</hi> and the <hi>Barmudas.</hi> Here al<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Fiftly, Naui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation seemes to bee of greater importance for the defence of a Countrey against forraine Nations; because Sea-fights are lesse dangerous and inconuenient to the Land, then Land-fights. All these arguments haue their force and life to proue the profit of this excellent Science. Many arguments may bee drawne to proue the vse of it for pleasure and delectation; which being well vsed, hath his place amongst other of Gods especiall blessings. This delight will first shew it selfe in the mutuall commerce and society with other Nations: Sith a
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:8020:227"/>
man (as <hi>Aristotle</hi> affirmes) is by nature inclined to mutuall society, and cannot reape greater pleasure then in such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctions: And as one Man with another findes solace; so one Nation with another: especially in the variety of sundry <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, customes, rites,</hi> and <hi>dispositions.</hi> Secondly, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of wise <hi>Nature,</hi> who hath endowed diuerse coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes with diuers <hi>Minerals, Plants, Beasts,</hi> and such commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities; then which variety nothing can be more delectable to an ingenious vnderstanding. To all which we may add as a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rollary, the <hi>Honour</hi> which hath been giuen to Nauigation by Princes and States, as well of former as later yeeres. In ancient times wee read that <hi>Ptolomy Philadelphus,</hi> that learned King of <hi>Egypt,</hi> who furnished himselfe with so rich a <hi>Library</hi> 277 yeeres before Christs Incarnation, gaue great incouragement to Nauigation, and maintained the passage through <hi>Sinus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabicus,</hi> or the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> by which the commodities of <hi>India</hi> and <hi>Arabia</hi> were brought to <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and from thence dispersed through diuerse places of <hi>Europe, Asia,</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> This was afterward seconded and cherished by the <hi>Romans,</hi> at which time <hi>Egypt</hi> was made subiect to their dominion: But the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire being afterwards rent in pieces by the <hi>Gothes, Vandals, Lumbards,</hi> and <hi>Saracens,</hi> all trafficke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt nations began a while to cease; till such time as the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conuenience being knowne, a new <hi>Mart</hi> was set vp at <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha</hi> in <hi>Taurica Chersonesus,</hi> belonging at that time to the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois:</hi> Thence was it deriued to <hi>Trebizond,</hi> and afterwards to <hi>Samerchand,</hi> where the <hi>Indian, Turkish,</hi> &amp; <hi>Persian</hi> Merchants were wont to trade with the <hi>Venetians.</hi> This <hi>Art</hi> was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards set vp and reuiued by the <hi>Sultans</hi> of <hi>Egypt,</hi> through the passage of the <hi>Red-Sea,</hi> till such time as it was in a manner taken away by the <hi>Portugals, Spaniards, English,</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi>; who haue found out for themselues a better way by the <hi>Cape of good Hope,</hi> to the <hi>East Indies,</hi> and by this meanes much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated the Trafficke of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> and the wealth of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians.</hi> Neither in this Age of ours haue there wanted great Potentates, who haue not onely endowed this <hi>Trade</hi> with great and ample priuiledges; but also themselues practised
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:8020:227"/>

                           <p>The originall of fountaines and Riuers on the earth is a matter of great difficulty, and for ought I know, not yet found out of our greatest <hi>Philosophers</hi>; yet being willing to goe as farre as I can, I will glaunce at probabilities, and first set downe other mens opinions. Some haue beene of opinion
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:8020:229"/>
that in the bowels of the earth are hid certaine vast concauities and cauernes, which receiuing into them a great quantity of raine-Water, haue giuen originall to <hi>Lakes</hi> and <hi>Fountaines.</hi> Hence they giue the reason why these fountaines are perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall; Because the raine-water receiued into these cauernes being extraordinary great, is sufficient to nourish such springs of water vntill the next winter; whence comes a new supply of more raine. These Riuers (say they) in the summer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, and sometime are dry, because of the defect of w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ter, when the place is not great enough to receiue sufficient water for the whole yeere. This opinion seemeth grounded on these reasons: First, because wee find by experience, that Riuers and fount<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ines are greater and larger in <hi>Summer</hi> then in <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> Secondly, because where there is lesse <hi>Raine,</hi> fewer or no Riuers are seene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> As in the Desarts of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> and <hi>Africke</hi> few or no Riuers are found: But in <hi>Germany, France, Brittany,</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> many Riuers shew themselues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> because they abound in the moisture of the <hi>Aire</hi> and much fall of <hi>Raine.</hi> Thirdly, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst vs (wee see by experience) in a hot and dry <hi>Summer</hi> they are much decreased from their ordinary greatnesse, or al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together dryed vp; which is a great probability that their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall is from raine. This opinion if it bee onely vnderstood of some Riuers, may be probable; because some currents out of doubt take their originall from great showers or snowes, as at the foot of the <hi>Alpes</hi> and other such places, where the snow daily melts and feeds them: but if it be generally vnderstood of all Riuers, it is manifestly false as may appeare by these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. First, because the Earth no where drinkes vp the raine farther then ten foot deep in the soile; for the higher superfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the earth is either dry and so easily drinkes vp and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes the Water within that space; or else being already moist, it receiues it not at all, but expells it by Riuers and channells: Secondly, some mountaines not couered with earth, but consisting of hard rocke, notwithstanding send forth great store of <hi>springs</hi> and <hi>fountaines,</hi> which water could not bee receiued in, through a hard rocky substance. Thirdly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in very dry places certaine pits being digged downe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:8020:230"/>
the ground 2 hundred or three hundred foot deep, will dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer many great streames of Water, which could not be from the receite of Raine. Fourthly, it cannot be imagined that so much raine could in a winter fall into one place, besides that which the drouth of the earth consumes, to nourish so mighty and great Riuers in the Earth, as are Riuers running in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall course. Fiftly, all Riuers almost take their originall from some mountaines or other; as <hi>Danubius</hi> from the <hi>Alpes,</hi> and <hi>Nilus</hi> from the mountaines of the <hi>Moone</hi> in <hi>Africke</hi>; Which places being extraordinary high, are more vnapt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue water, then lower places of the earth. To the reasons that they alleadge for their opinions, it is not hard to answer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That riuers should be greater in winter th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap> in the summer, the cause may be better giuen, Because more moisture of the Aire falls into the brinke from externall R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>ine or snow in winter then in summer; and the ground being moister, is able to drinke lesse then at other times: which is also the reason why in hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and dry Countreyes there is not such plenty of Riuers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for we deny not, but fountaines may sometimes be increased and sometimes diminished by addition of raine-water but that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny such vast con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>auity should be vnder ground, as the recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of so much raine, and should nourish so many and so great currents. The second opinion is of those who thinke that the originall of all riuers and fountaines is from the Sea: Which conceit hath beene strongly fortified by many Fathers of the Church, and graue Diuines of later time; which opinion is chiefly grounded vpon these reasons: First because it seemes a most incredible matter, that so much vaporous matter should be engendred vnder the earth, to feed such a perpetuall course of water: Secondly, if all Riuers should not be deriued from the sea, no reason could bee giuen, why so many riuers dayly emptying themselues into the sea, the sea should not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, but continue in the same quantity. Thirdly, to this purpose they vrge the place of <hi>Eccles.</hi> 1. <hi>All riuers runne in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the sea, and yet the sea is not full: To the place whence they came they returne, that they may flow againe.</hi> But this opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on seemes to bee shaken with a great difficulty. For it is a
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:8020:230"/>
hard matter to conceiue how the water of the sea being by nature heauy, &amp; lower then the superficies of the earth (as we haue demonstrated) should ascend into high mountaines; out of which we find springs of water oftentimes to arise: for ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it must ascend <hi>Naturally</hi> or by <hi>Violence</hi>: not naturally for the foresaid cause; because it is a heauy body: If violently, they must assigne some externall Agent, which enforceth it to this violence. This difficulty diuerse Authors haue laboured diuerse waies to salue: Some amongst whom the chiefe was <hi>Theoderet</hi>
                              <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> haue fled to a supernaturall cause in Gods provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; as though the water in it's own nature heauy, should be notwithstanding enforced to the topps of the mountaines; But this opinion seemes very improbable; because, although we cannot deny Gods miraculous and extraordinary wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in some things; yet all men haue supposed this to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd within the bounds of nature: And very strange it were to imagine that almighty God in the first institution of nature should impose a perpetuall violence vpon nature.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:8020:231"/>
asmuch as they are supposed to driue and enforce the water against his owne nature. For by nature (as all men know) it is apt to descend; whereas here it is supposed to ascend by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of such spirits. They cannot bee violent agents because they bee perpetuall; whereas no violent thing can be perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall. <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> being desirous to shew, how much fountaines could ascend out of the <hi>sea-water</hi> varies in opinion from the former, and imagines that the <hi>fountaines</hi> and <hi>Riuer-water</hi> is drawne vpwards through the force of <hi>Celestiall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> for the common good; to wit that it might water aswell the <hi>mettalls</hi> in the bowells of the earth, as giue moisture and nourishment to <hi>Plants,</hi> and liuing creatures, dwelling there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And this motion (saith he) although it be against the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> nature of the water, is not altogether violent: because elementary bodyes are bound by a certaine law to obey and subiect themselues to the heauenly; so that motions impressed by them, are not enforced on them by violence.

But this opinion of <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> (in my conceit) seemes lesse sound then the former: For first <hi>Thomas</hi> had no need at all of these shifts, holding some of his other grounds: For in another place, comparing the hight of the <hi>s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              </gap> in some places, were sufficient to cause such <hi>springs</hi> and <hi>riuers</hi> in the earth: Secondly, his opinion cannot stand without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest contradiction of himselfe; for how can the water, being of his owne nature heauy, be drawne vpward without vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and thwarting of nature. And whereas he alleadges for himselfe an <hi>obedientiall</hi> aptnesse in the elementary bodies to obey the superiour, he shall find very little helpe to maintaine his part. For this <hi>obedientiall</hi> inclination must be either accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

to the nature of the water, or opposite vnto it, or at least the one must be sudordinate vnto the other: That it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the nature of the water, he himselfe disclaimes and experience refutes; because it naturally <hi>descends,</hi> not <hi>ascends:</hi> if it be opposite (as indeed it must needes be) he contradicts himselfe: If the <hi>Physicall</hi> and <hi>obedientiall</hi> inclination be <hi>subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate</hi> the one to the other; I vrge, that subordinate causes can produce no other then subordinate effects; for asmuch as the causes and the effects are measured and proportioned the one by the other. But wee plainly see that the motions of as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent or descent are diametrally opposed, and contrary the one to the other; so that they cannot otherwise proceed, then from opposite and contrary causes. Secondly this obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall aptnesse, is commonly vnderstood of a creature, in respect of his Creator, in whose hand it is, as to create all things of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, so to reduce all things againe into nothing. But this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be aboue nature, yet no way contradicts nature: and easier it is to be imagined, that the <hi>Creator</hi> should annihilate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Creature,</hi> then letting it remaine in his own Nature, giue it a motion against nature: Moreouer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Thirdly, it will hardly be resolued by any of this opinion, by what meanes or instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the heauenly or superiour Bodies can haue such an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratiue power ouer the water, as to lift it vpward from his owne Center: for neither can this thing be performed by <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, hight,</hi> or any <hi>Influe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce,</hi> which are the three meanes of ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of celestiall Bodies on elementary: I will not stand to proue every particular in this matter: But onely would haue my aduersary to answere, and giue an instance and speciality.

Moreouer a great part of the Earth, and other vapours therein contained, and stirred vp by the force of the Starres, are conuerted into Aire; and that aswell the Aire included in the bowells of the Earth, as vapours there also bred, are perpetually conuerted into water: This reason may seeme to perswade, because it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes of necessity, that the coldnesse of the Earth expelling their heat, they should harden &amp; condensate, &amp; be disposed at last to the generation of water: whence also the cause <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

in the Earth; Thirdly (we haue already shewed) that the <hi>super<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ficies</hi> of the Earth is higher then the Water; so that it cannot be conceiued how riuers should be deriued from the Sea. To this opinion, howsoeuer seeming probable, and supported with the name and authority of so great a <hi>Philosopher,</hi> I dare not wholly assent; forasmuch as it thwarts the Testimony of holy <hi>Scripture,</hi> and cannot otherwise stand with reason: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it cannot well be imagined how so many vapours, and so continually, should be ingendred in the bowels of the earth, to nourish so many and so great currents, as we see springing out of the Earth: for a very great quantity or portion of <hi>Aire</hi> being condensated and made Water, will become but as a little drop: The Aire, according to <hi>Aristotles</hi> grounds being by a <hi>Tenne-fold</hi> proportion thinner then the Water. Moreouer the <hi>Aire</hi> in these places seated in the <hi>superficies</hi> of the Earth, and higher then other places, and by consequent neerer the Sun, should rather be <hi>rarified</hi> and <hi>thickned</hi>; because heat is the greatest cause of rarefaction, as we shall shew hereafter: for the reasons alleaged for these opinions, they are drawne only from the weaknes of their assertion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which hold that <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines</hi> are deriued either from <hi>Raine water,</hi> or from the <hi>Sea:</hi> both which wee haue examined briefly, and whereof wee shall speake hereafter.

who caused many men expert in digging of mettalls, to be let downe into an old and forsaken <hi>mine</hi> to search out the veines of mettalls, to see whether the couetousnesse of antiquity had left any thing to posterity. These men vsing great lights are said to haue found nothing there, but great and vast riuers and great receptacles of waters. This they also labour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme by many and suddaine eruptions and breaking out of waters out of the earth, whereof we shall haue occasion to speake more hereafter. This first position, howsoeuer in it selfe true enough, seemes litle to the purpose; but we will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to the second, which is this: That when God in the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> third day of the Creation seperated the waters into one place, and hid it in the cauerns and secret receptacles of the earth; at the same time dispersed into diuerse parts of the earth, a great quantity of water by diuerse occult passages and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, whence comes that great masse of waters vnder the earth; which is before mentioned. This they seeme to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade by reason: for (say they) as the wise <hi>Architect</hi> of all for mans sake, and the rest of liuing creatures for the vse of man, hath discouered the dry land, by restrayning all the waters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one place: so it was most necessary, that he should in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly water the earth; by which <hi>stones, mettalls, mineralls,</hi> &amp; other such things in the bowells of the Earth, should in time grow and increase. Also that some water should from hence breake vp out of the Earth, for diuerse causes hereafter spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified. Finally as <hi>Philo-Iudaeus</hi> affirmes, for the continuation of the parts of the earth, which otherwise might by drouth be seperated and diuided. The third proposition grounded on <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the two former is this; That many riuers and fountaines in diuerse places by Gods decree arise out of the earth, by quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of waters hid in the cauernes of the earth, which they proue by reasons drawne from the vtility of such fountaines <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and riuers, springing out of the earth. Fourthly they defend, that all fountaines and currents were not so made and appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the first <hi>Creation</hi>; because Histories &amp; experience teach vs, that many haue broken out of the ground afterwards; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> whereof we shall haue occasion to speake hereafter.

they affirme, that if the opinion of <hi>Aristotle</hi> be vnderstood of all fountaines and flouds, it cannot be approued; for as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it seemes sufficiently declared in the third opinion, how such riuers might be generated without such vapours; as also because many arguments and places of <hi>holy Scriptures,</hi> seeme to proue the contrary. As also the foure Riuers of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radice</hi> created in the beginning of the world, cannot bee guessed to draw their originall from such vapours, as <hi>Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle</hi> imagines; to which accord many ancient <hi>Fathers</hi> vpon these places recited in that opinion, whereas all riuers are thought to fetch their originall from the sea. Sixtly for the credit of their master <hi>Aristotle,</hi> they are constrained to auerre that although his opinion cannot be verified of all riuers and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> fountaines of the earth, yet if it be restrayned to some such perpetuall currents, it may haue probability, For asmuch aswe are to beleeue that many such large cauerns and holes are hid vnder the earth, in which no small quantity of vapours may be inge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dred. This probability is greater in those riuers which are lesser in quantity then the greater, for the reasons before shewed. Seuenthly they affirme that it is absolutely to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeued; that not only great riuers and currents are deriued <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> from subterranean waters, which haue originall from the sea; but also lesse fountaines and springs for the most part, chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge the same beginning: whence they labour to proue by this reason, that in very few places of the earth there is found so perpetuall and apt disposition of vapours vnder the ground as to nourish so many and so great currents of water. Eight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (say they) it cannot be denied, but that Waters aswell pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> from raine, as that which is generated of vapours in the cauerns of the earth, sometimes may flow into fountaines and riuers: What concernes Torrents bred of <hi>raine,</hi> they haue recourse to the reasons of the first opinion; for others they make it also probable; because we see by experience that <hi>Vapours</hi> and <hi>Aire</hi> compassed about with earth, are by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the cold enuironing it, turned into water, This is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the opinion of those subtill <hi>Iesuits</hi> of <hi>Conimbra,</hi> wherein although they giue a flourish, as if they would defend their

It will bee expected at least that we should disclose our owne opinion, hauing censured the former: which we will briefly doe as neere as probability can lead vs, submitting also to those which are more iudicious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> First therefore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we will suppose as probable: that the earth is in a manner compassed round about with water; for howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer the places more eminent, and separated for our habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be dry land<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet not farre vnder the superficies of the earth, whereon we tread, is the earth sprinkled round with water, for which we may draw an argument; aswell fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Porous</hi> and <hi>spongy</hi> nature of the <hi>Earth,</hi> which is apt to drinke in the water of the <hi>sea,</hi> in the same hight; (because it is the nature of the water, to diffuse it selfe abroad) as also from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Minors</hi> and such as digg deepe into the earth, who in most parts find water<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, this water so enuironing the earth, were it left to it's own naturall situation, without an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Agent, would lift his superficies no higher, then the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficies of the sea; because being as one with the sea, it will challenge the same <hi>Sphericall</hi> superficies. Now to know how the water thus naturally settled, is notwihtstanding lif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vp higher to become the source of Springs, we must vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand, that it comes to passe not onely by the heat of the <hi>sunne</hi> and <hi>starres,</hi> piercing farte vnder the superficies of the earth, according to the circle, we haue allotted to the water.

will not curiously here dispute, being of it selfe too large a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect for me in this place to handle. This <hi>heat</hi> may be conceiued to concur to the production of fountaines 2 manner of waies: First, by drawing vp diuerse moist <hi>vapours,</hi> which by reason of the <hi>thicknesse</hi> and solidity of the earth, being not presently euaporated out of the superficies of the earth, are enforced to disperse themselues through diuerse crooked passages, where condensated by cold distilling againe into drops of water, they breake out through some places of the earth, and so become a fountaine. A second way which may also seeme probable, is that the <hi>Heat</hi> peircing the <hi>Subterranean Water,</hi> though not able to dissolue much of it into vapours for the solidity of the earth, may notwithstanding through his heat, <hi>Rarifie</hi> and attenuate these waters. These waters then rarified, must needs seeke a greater place, wherein they may be contained: sith <hi>Rarefaction</hi> is nothing else but the extension of a body to a greater place then before it occupied. Hence is the Water enforced to enlarge his limits: This enlargement or the place cannot be downeward towards the Center; because all that place was supposed to be filled vp as farre as the Earth could drinke it. Wherefore it must needs extend it's limits <hi>sidewise,</hi> or <hi>vpwards:</hi> By the former of which it may find a passage to breake forth on the superficies of the ground: By the latter it may be lifted high enough, to runne from the side of a higher mountaine, towards the <hi>Sea-shore.</hi> If any man should aske why this <hi>Rarefaction</hi> &amp; swelling of the Water is not so sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the open <hi>Ocean,</hi> I answere that the sea is also much rarified &amp; lifted vp by reason of the sunnes heate: which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the cause of ebbing and flowing of the sea, in part we haue before disputed: Secondly that the <hi>sea-water</hi> should not rise so high as other water vnder the ground, these rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons may be giuen; First that the <hi>Ocean</hi> hath a larger channell to runne abroad on either side, and so this swelling must of necessity become more insensible, whereas the Waters in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerns &amp; concauities of the Earth, being oftentimes straightly bounded on either side, by the narrownesse of the channell, must of necessity take vp the more in hight and eminency. 2
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:8020:235"/>
the <hi>Sunne, heauenly bodies</hi> and <hi>subterranean fires</hi> worke more strongly and effectually on the open nakednes of the sea, then on the waters hid vnder the ground, which are more shrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from such an extreame heat. Whence it comes to passe, that many parts of the <hi>sea,</hi> are dissolued into <hi>vapours,</hi> and so consumed and dispelled by the same; Whereas this heat in the <hi>Subterranean</hi> waters being more moderatly impressed; doeth not dissolue into vapours, and consume so great a quantity of water; but being of a middle temper, rather rarifies it to the vse forenamed. This seemes the more probable, because spring water rising commonly in the sides of mountaines, is for the most part thinner then the Sea-water, as experience dayly warrants, Thirdly the <hi>subterranean</hi> vapours are soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner dissolued into dropps of water by reason of the <hi>cold</hi> they must necessarily meete within their passage, through the <hi>Earth</hi>; whereas the other from the <hi>Sea</hi> meet with no such en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter till they arriue at the <hi>Middle-Region</hi> of the <hi>Aire,</hi> whence they returne againe in showres of Raine.</p>

                           </argument>
                           <p>For the confirmation of this assertion, many histories may be produced: It is reported that in <hi>Caria</hi> neere about the city <hi>Lorus,</hi> there arose out of the Earth suddenly a great floud of Water, bringing out with it a great quantity of creatures and fishes, of which being fatted vnder the Earth, whosoeuer chanced to eat, dyed presently. The like is reported, that at the time of the <hi>Mithridatick</hi> warre, at a certaine city of <hi>Phry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia</hi> named <hi>Apamea,</hi> there sprang vp out of the ground many new <hi>Lakes, Fountaines, Brookes</hi>; and that one riuer sprang vp very <hi>salt,</hi> which brought vp with it a great quantity of <hi>Oisters,</hi> and other <hi>Sea-fishes</hi>; although the city <hi>Apamea</hi> bee very farre off from the <hi>Sea.</hi> This is reported by <hi>Nicolaus Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mascene.</hi> Also Cardinall <hi>Contarenus</hi> testifies in the second booke of Elements, that in a cleare day being in <hi>Valentia</hi> in <hi>Spaine,</hi> there happened a very great <hi>inundation</hi> of water brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king out of the Earth, which being carried towards the City,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:8020:236"/>
had well neere turned it into the Sea, had not the gates bin shut, and dammes well ordered. Why this sudden change should sometimes happen, many reasons may be produced. The first reason may be, because of some sudaine ruine or fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling downe of some parts of the Earth, whereby the courses of the riuers being one way stopped, must needs seeke out a passage some other way. This sometimes happens in great <hi>Earth-quakes,</hi> as we may reade in <hi>Theophrastus,</hi> that in the mountaine <hi>Coricus,</hi> after an <hi>Earth-quake</hi> many new springs and fountaines discouered themselues. Another reason not much vnlike the former is giuen from the <hi>Hardnes</hi> of the Earth, which oftentimes stopping and hindering the naturall course of the water, enforceth it to seek a new passage. Hence the foresaid <hi>Theophrastus</hi> was induced to belieue, that in a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Crete</hi> the fountaines were stopped vp because the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants betoke themselues to another place; so that the soile was not so much shooke and moued as before. A third reason may be the wasting or cutting downe of great <hi>woods</hi> on the Earth; for it is the nature of the Trees and plants to suck to themselues the Moisture of the ground into one place. But these trees cut downe or remoued, the waters course must needes be altered.</p>

                           <p>For the confirmation of this point, there want not reasons: The first reason may be drawne from the quantity of Water in most Lakes, which is found without any great sensible dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to remaine the same, without any diminution or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease; whereas if the water bound in with these limits, should haue no passage out any way, it should encrease to such greatnes, that it would easily ouerwhelme the bankes To giue a few instances, we find that diuerse very vast riuers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haust themselues into the <hi>Caspian</hi> Lake as <hi>Volga</hi> and <hi>Edill,</hi> which receiuing into them many notable riuers, are at last themselues swallowed vp in the said lake: In like manner the Lake of <hi>Palestine</hi> called the dead sea, is known to receiue into it besides diuerse lesser riuers, the great and famous riuer <hi>Ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan.</hi> Heere would I demaund, whether these great riuers perpetually casting themselues into a Lake, giue an encrease to the former quantity or not: if they should augment the water, they would by consequence alter the bounds: But this is contradicted by experience. If the quantity of the water suffers no encrease, it must needs follow then, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter should some other way be diminished, as it is heere encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. This must either be by the sunne drawing vp some parts of it by vapours, or by some cauerns of the Earth, drinking vp some parts of it: Or lastly by a subterranean passage into
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:8020:240"/>
the sea: Concerning the former it cannot bee denied, but much Water is drawne vp into <hi>vapours</hi> by the heat of the <hi>sun</hi> yet that these vapours counteruaile the water perpetually brought in, is in my conceit very improbable: for against this quantity of water extracted out this way of <hi>evaporation,</hi> I will oppose these three things which shal perswade a reaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable man, that the water receiued in, shall farre surpasse the vapours exhaled from it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> First that the vapours are stirred vp in the day time, when the sunne is lifted aboue the <hi>Horizon</hi>; at such a height that his heat is somewhat strengthned, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as all these watry currents neuer intermitting their vsuall course, neuer cease to runne by <hi>day</hi> or <hi>night:</hi> wherein is seen a double aduantage of the riuers, in respect of the watry exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Secondly of these watry vapours, so drawne out, a great part must at diuerse times returne back, or at least so much otherwise by <hi>rayny</hi> showres, dropped downe into this <hi>Lake.</hi> Thirdly, these watry parts thus rarified and attenuated in vapour should (putting this supposition) in equality, diffuse themselues abroad in such extraordinary manner, that all the Regions round about should in all likely-hood suffer a great inconueniency of foggy exhalations. On the other side it is very vnlikely, that it should bee receiued into empty ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns of the Earth, without passage into the sea, or some great riuer, disburthening it selfe thereunto. For I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund whether these cauerns were euer filled with water or not? if they haue been filled, how could they receiue more water, sith the filling of any place supposeth it to be first empty. That they were neuer yet filled with Water, is farre more vnreasonable: that any man should imagine, any ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne of the Earth to bee so vast, with so great currents of Water perpetually running in almost six thousand yeares, should not replenish: especially considering the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ells of the Earth, not farre from the vpper face, to be every where spread with Water round, which might also helpe to this purpose: Wherefore it cannot well bee imagined but that euery such great lake, hath some vent or passage vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the sea, either by some <hi>secret</hi> &amp; subterranean channell, or
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:8020:240"/>
at least by some great <hi>riuer</hi> issuing out of it, and so running into the Ocean. Another reason may be taken from the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents of some seas, which are by good reason ascribed to this cause: For it is obserued by skilfull Nauigatours, that the Water is carried by a very stiffe course from <hi>Propontis</hi> and the <hi>black</hi> sea into the <hi>Aegaean,</hi> and from thence into the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean</hi>: The originall of which current m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Thirdly that these subterranean passages are not vnlikely, may be confirmed by many riuers which are swallowed vp, some wholly, some for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                              <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent monuments of the fathers before the flood, may probably be coniectured by the testimony of <hi>Iosephus</hi> a writer of good credit, who affirmeth that he saw one of the pillars, erected by <hi>Seth,</hi> the second from <hi>Adam</hi>; which pillars were set vp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue 1426 yeares before the flood, accompting <hi>Seth</hi> to bee a hundred yeares old at the erection of them, and <hi>Iosephus</hi> himselfe to haue liued some 40 or 50 yeares after <hi>Christ</hi>; Now although we are not bound to credit all thar he relates; yet may we trust him concerning such matters as happened in his time; and that this pillar was set vp by <hi>Seth</hi> was neuer yet called in question, but warranted by <hi>antiquity:</hi> the like is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by <hi>Berosus</hi> of the Citty of <hi>Enoch,</hi> that it was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molished by the flood, but remained many yeares after, the ruines whereof as <hi>Annius</hi> in his commentary reports, were to be seene in his time, who liued in the time of <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Isabella</hi> of <hi>Castile.</hi> It is also reported by <hi>Pomponius Mela,</hi> that the Citty of <hi>Ioppa</hi> was built before the flood, of which <hi>Cepha</hi> was King, whose name with his brother <hi>Phineus</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the grounds and principles of their religion, were found grauen vpon Altars of stone: All which are sufficient to proue the violence of the Waters, not to haue bin so great to demolish all <hi>mountaines</hi> and <hi>monuments</hi>; Moreouer it may be plainly proued out of the text, that the Waters suffered the plants and trees of the Earth to grow, and remaine as<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they did before; because it is said, that when <hi>Noah</hi> the second time sent out the <hi>Doue,</hi> she returned with an <hi>oliue</hi> branch in her mouth, which no doubt she had plucked from the trees, after the trees were vncouered; for otherwise she might the first time haue found it floating on the Waters: a manifest proof that the trees were not torne vp by the roots, or turned topsy turuy, but remained fixed in the Earth as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. Fourthly, had the water suffered this extreame violent motion, as whereby it might make many mountaines. I aske whence this motion should come<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it could not bee from the

naturall motion of the water, which is to moue downward: for what descent of waters can bee in a <hi>Sphericall</hi> round bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, where no part is higher, or lower? That there was any wind to driue and enrage the Waters, is very vnlikely; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is said, that God caused a wind to passe vpon the Earth, and the Waters ceased<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so that there was no wind till the Waters sanke: Lastly, wee may argue from a <hi>finall cause,</hi> that this inequality in the superficies of the Earth was before the flood; because it is certaine that all things were in as good or better estate, then now with vs, and that the Earth was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned with all varieties of creatures as well for <hi>profit</hi>; as <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectation.</hi> Now it is found by experience, that all commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities agree not to all places, but some are found in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, at all sorts of <hi>mettalls</hi> &amp; <hi>mineralls, Plants,</hi> &amp; <hi>Vegetalls</hi> for the most part prosper best in the <hi>vallies</hi> and <hi>plaines</hi>: Also that the mountaines serue for a shelter to guard the vallies from the rigor of <hi>cold</hi> and <hi>wind,</hi> both for the better conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encie of mans life, and encrease of fruits for the vse of man: Whence we may conclude, that it is farre more probable, that the great <hi>Mountaines</hi> were so created in the beginning, and not made by the flood; yet can wee not deny, but that some small <hi>Hillockes</hi> might be made by the flood, and afterward by the industrie of man, which haue raised great <hi>fortresses,</hi> and bulworks, which afterward decaied, were made great heaps of Earth (as we see many in this land) but this is of small note &amp; not worthy consideration, in comparison of the great moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines of the Earth whereof we especially treat.</p>

A second reason why <hi>mountanous</hi> Regions should exceed others in cold, may be the vicinity of them to the middle Region of the Aire; for of all the Regions (if we beleiue <hi>Aristotle</hi>) the <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi> is the <hi>coldest,</hi> as being more seperate from the <hi>Sunne</hi> the fountaine of <hi>heat,</hi> and the higher Region, farther off from the reflexion of the <hi>Sunne-beames,</hi> then the lower: Now sith the parts of the Earth are affected with the quality of the Aire, it must needs stand with reason, that the more it shall approach to the <hi>middle Region,</hi> the more it must partake of its quality.

This Theoreme to demonstrate the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, we will first lay these grounds oftentimes before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned. First (as appeares by testimony of holy Scripture) the figure of the Earth was in the beginning more perfectly <hi>Sphericall,</hi> ouer-whelmed euery-where with Waters. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> That a seperation was made by translocation of the parts of the Earth, in such manner as some places admitting of conca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uities, became the receptacle of the waters, other places wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on these parts of the Earth were heaped together, were made mountanous. 3. Hence will follow, that the Earth thus swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling vp in high mountaines, is out of his naturall site and posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:8020:245"/>
&amp; therefore according to the law of nature, will endeuour by litle and litle to returne to her former state and condition. Now that the Earth hath sensibly suffered such a change since the beginning, it is easie to shew out of experiments: the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses we shall find to be the <hi>water,</hi> aswell of the <hi>Rain</hi> as <hi>Riuers,</hi> which we shall demonstrate by these Reasons: 1 We see <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers</hi> by litle and litle continually to fret and eat out the feet of <hi>mountaines,</hi> whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce the parts thus fretted through, by co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall falling downe weare out the mountaines, and fill vp the lower places in the valleyes, making the one to encrease, as the other to decrease, &amp; the whole Earth to approach nearer to a <hi>Sphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall</hi> figure then before; which seemes to be warranted by a place in <hi>Iob</hi> 14, where he saith to God; <hi>The mountaine falling, commeth to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The waters weare the stones, thou washest away the things which grow out of the dust of the earth.</hi> From these Riuers in the valleyes continually eating through the parts of the Earth, as the feete of mountaines are caused those slow but great Ruines called <hi>Labinae, a lambendo,</hi> by which sometimes whole Townes and Villages haue bin cast into the next great Riuer. 2 To proue that Raine water challengeth a part in this diminution of mountains, we may shew by the like experie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce: we see plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that Raine-water daily washes downe from the Toppes of mountaines some parts of the Earth; whence it comes to passe that the highest mountaines are harder and more rocky then others as being more able to resist this violence of the water. Hence also it happens that old buildings being erected in the sides of mountaines, haue their foundations after a time vnco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered, and are much subiect to Ruines: an instance whereof may bee giuen out of the <hi>Romane Capitoll,</hi> whose foundation (according to the relation of <hi>George Agricola</hi>) appeares now plainly aboue the ground, which without question was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore deepe rooted in the Earth. In Plaines and valleyes we find all things to happen contrary wise, to wit, that all places in regard of their superficies are raised much higher then they were in times past, The reason whereof may easily be giuen out of the great quantity of the Earth, carried by the washing
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:8020:246"/>
of the Raine from the Topps of mountaines into the valleyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whence we may perceiue old houses, heretofore fairely built, to be now almost buried vnder ground, and their windowes heretofore set at a reasonable hight, now growne euen with the pauement: so some write of the Triumphall Arch of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timius</hi> at the foot of the Capitoll Mountaine in <hi>Rome,</hi> now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most couered with Earth, insomuch as they are inforced to descend down into it by as many staires as formerly they were vsed to asce<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d. In like sort we see in old Monasteries &amp; Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous houses, their lower roomes, windowes, &amp; doores, very far couched vnder grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, of which great inco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenience we cannot suspect the Architects iudgment, but rather our fore-mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned cause: from this burying of parts of some houses vnder ground, it may be gathered, that the farther they are vnder ground, so much ancienter they are: as we may obserue heere with vs in <hi>Oxford,</hi> that our most ancient Colledges haue the windowes of their lower roomes, some-where altogether choaked vp with Earth without, or at least halfe way, in so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the flore within, is found to bee farre inferiour in height to the street without: This is also confirmed by Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitects, who in digging vp old foundations, before they came to firme ground whereon to erect a building, are enfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced first to remoue away the <hi>Rubbish</hi> or (as they terme it) the <hi>Made-ground,</hi> wherein oftentimes they find <hi>Wood, Iron-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, old coine,</hi> with diuers other Trash of this Nature. An instance we haue in some of the lower places in <hi>Somerset<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shire,</hi> where some vpon occasion digging the Earth somewhat deep, haue found great <hi>Okes</hi> turned topsy turvy with their Roots vpwards. To coniecture with some, that this was cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by <hi>Noah's Floud,</hi> seemes to be very improbable: 1 be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause as we haue formerly shewed in this Chapter, the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the <hi>Deluge</hi> could not haue so violent a motion to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure such an alteration in the parts of the Earth. 2 It cannot so well be imagined how such Trees should remaine so long a time without putrefaction: wherefore we cannot well cast it on any other cause, then the addition of the earthly parts, brought by raine from the mountaines into the valleyes: and
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:8020:246"/>
so by some Land-flood which partakes much of slimy and earthly matter dispersed abroad vpon the land about. Now on the contrary part wee find in few places of mountaines such <hi>made-ground</hi> which hath before beene moued. This will also appeare out of the industry of our <hi>Low-countreyman,</hi> who by baying vp the Riuers into certaine Artificiall Channels, the ground about hath been much raised: where on the contrary side the forcing of the water into higher places, oftentimes is found to fret through the Earth, and make it lower. What we haue spoken of the effects of Riuers and Raine in diminishing the greatnes of the mountaines and exalting of the vallyes, we may in some sort find in the sea. For the bottome of the Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lower then the Earth, and many great Riuers continually running from the Earth into it; it is manifest that there is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in their current a great quantity of earth, in so much as by the heaping of sand and earthly rubbish, the mouthes of great Riuers are in time choaked vp, and commodious hauens spoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and remoued farther into the land: of which alternall trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation of the Sea and Land w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

For to let passe the ordinary vse of fire in euery house and family, which in so infinite a multitude of people, in so many yeeres since the Flood, must require an extraordinary proportion of wood and fuell, how many Arts haue beene since inuented, depending onely vpon this Element? we will goe no farther then the Art of <hi>Lique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> fining of gold and other mettals, found out in the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the Earth, wherein the couetousnesse of men hath been as vnsati<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

To this which wee haue said, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be opposed two things: first, the power and inclination of euery Creature to multiply and propagate it selfe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the industry of mankind in seconding that inclination: Whence it may bee coniectured that great woods should by durance increase to a greater quantity: for the former, no man
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:8020:248"/>
will deny, but that plants and trees left to themselues, will commonly propagate their kind: neuerthelesse it cannot pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile so much as the other, which procure the decrease: first because the Earth being dryer now, then soone vpon the Flood, cannot so much further the growth of vegetals as then it did: Secondly, because (as wee haue said) this growth in a populous Countrey, cannot bee so great as the diminution, since few or no houses can want so necessary an Element as fire. To the second wee answer that mans industry hath done somewhat in plantation of groues, and such like: but how little is this in comparison of the huge and vast forrests in time by man wasted and consumed. We shall read of <hi>Germany,</hi> that in the time of <hi>Caesar</hi> it seemed a wilde Countrey, hauing many great woods and forrests, but few Cities: but now the case be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altered, we shall find the Cities both in number and great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes increased, and the Woods diminished. Two instances may suffice, the one of the Forrest of <hi>Ardenna</hi> in <hi>Lutzemburg,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted in <hi>Caesars</hi> time 500 miles ouer, now scarce 50.

                           <p>This situation wee vnderstand to comprehend almost all the temperat Zone, reaching either way so farre as 60 degrees or there about. The demonstration of this Theoreme depends of these two foments of all plants, Heat and Moisture; both which concurre, not only to the abundance and fertility, but also to the greatnesse of all plants; for it is most certaine that wheresoeuer these two vitall succours are wanting or defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, there must be a great scarcity of <hi>trees, fruits, herbage,</hi> and such like: This is the cause why the Regions far North neere
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:8020:248"/>
about the Pole, beyond 60 degrees, haue not onely scarcity of trees, but haue them such as are, of a farre smaller quantity then other Regions, lying more temperate: For the internall and naturall heat is almost extinguished, with the extremity of cold, and the moisture (as it were) dried vp by the frosty dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the Region. To this cause may wee ascribe, that which Geographers haue deliuered concerning Island, that for want of Timber they couer their houses with fish-bones, digging out houses in the sides of Rockes and mountaines. Moreouer that the meere defect of moisture may cause a scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of growth, may bee proued by many places: 1 because temperate Regions, which are Mountainous and lying higher, produce trees of small length; <hi>Bodin</hi> testifies as a thing very remarkeable, that hee hath obserued oakes in <hi>France</hi> not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding 3 or 4 feet. But this is no great wonder with vs in <hi>England:</hi> sith in the dry and barren plaines about <hi>Salisbury</hi> there are many examples not much different: All which, we can ascribe to no other cause then the want of moisture. On the other side as great or greater a defect of heat &amp; moisture, is found neere the <hi>Equatour,</hi> by reason of the externall heat of the Sunne; which in all plants and vegetalls, not onely euapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates the moisture, and by consequence causeth drowth; but by the extraction of Internall heat, leaueth a greater cold be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind, correspondent to that humour in a man, which we call <hi>Melancholy</hi> and <hi>choler-adust:</hi> But this extremity of heat cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing this defect of internall heat &amp; moisture, wee place not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly vnder the Equinoctiall; because we haue shewed it to be more temperate: but rather vnder the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> which by experience are found scorched with great heat. How subiect these places vnder the <hi>Tropickes</hi> are to this sterility, we need goe no farther then <hi>Libia</hi> and <hi>Numidia</hi> to confirme; Places by the report of trauailers, indigent not onely of Woods and Trees, but almost of all vitall succours. Whereas the Woods &amp; Forrests dispersed almost in euery region of <hi>Europe,</hi> and the more temperate parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> are celebrated of all writers.

or there-abouts; wee cannot warrant this as an absolute generall obseruation; because some places lying very low, and subiect to much moisture, though situat more Southerly, may enioy this proportion, as we haue formerly shewed of trees neere the Riuer <hi>Hiarotis</hi> recorded by <hi>Strabo,</hi> to haue their noone shadowes of 5 furlongs, as also of certaine trees in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi> neere <hi>Riuo Negro,</hi> wherein (as <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> writes) a King dwelt with all his family.

How from hence they should spread themselues into Ilands, is the doubt.

<pb n="186" facs="tcp:8020:251"/>
instinct fearefull of death, and carefull of his owne preseruati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Whence it is more likely to imagine, that these parcels of land being first furnished with such creatures, were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by the violence of the flood, or some other like Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, torne off from the maine Continent, retaining still such Creatures as it had before. But here <hi>S. Augustine</hi> seeme to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid this Argument two wayes: It is not (saith he) incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that wild and sauage beasts might bee transported from one Countrey to another by Sea: either by Men for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of Hunting; or else by the helpe of Angels by Gods Commandement, or at least permission. This answer seemes very probable as well for it selfe, supposing nothing impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Almighty God, as also for the authority of the Author. But with all reuerence to the Authour, whom all the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Churches are bound to honour, this assertion is not so strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fortified to enforce assent. And first it is not very likely that pleasure with men should so farre ouersway the generall weale and profit, as to transport so many rauenous and hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full beasts, for meere hunting sports and recreation. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the chase of some, as <hi>Lions, Leopards,</hi> and such like, hath more danger in it then sport or delight; and if so be these were conueyed ouer Sea for such ends, yet it is very probable, they would keepe them rather close and imprisoned to serue occasion, then to let them loose and free for farther propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Finally, whereas hee ascribes the transportation of them to the ministery of Angels; no man can deny but this may bee possible; because by their permission of Almighty God they might effect greater matters. Yet seemes this not so likely as the other, because wee finde that in the generall preseruation of all creatures in the Arke, hee vsed the ordinary helpe of Naturall meanes, although directed and assisted by a Diuine power: And of God effected greater matters in this sort, why may wee not belieue it of things of lesser moment and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity? But of this wee haue spoken before. Another reason for our opinion that Ilands were not before the flood, or at least from the Creation, is vrged by <hi>Verstegan</hi> a late Writer in this manner: There is nothing broken) (saith he) that hath not bin
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:8020:251"/>
whole; which he sets downe as an infallible principle: for howbeit Nature doth sometimes against her own intent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit some errours, in so much as the things formed haue either too much, or too little; yet bringeth she forth nothing broken or disseuered; but such as it is, it is alwayes whole and not broken, except afterwards by some accident. And if Nature, the hand-maide of God, neuer misseth this perfection, much more ought wee to belieue that God the Father of Nature in the first Creation left no part thereof broken and vnperfect. But euery man may see by ordinary obseruation, that the <hi>Clifts</hi> and <hi>bounds</hi> of the Sea (as not being by God in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion so formed) seeme not onely seuered and broken, but (as it were) cut <hi>streight</hi> and <hi>steep</hi> downe from the top to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome, not stooping or declining by degrees; as wee see in <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Hills</hi> in their descent vnto the valleyes. The forceable breach of the land (as wee pretend) by the Sea fretting through some narrow place, seemes the more to be confirmed in that we find it not steep towards the Land, where the Land declines by a sloping descent as in other places; but rather to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea in such sort, as both the sides of a narrow and streite Sea oftentimes in the nature of the soile, and conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of figure, seeme to answer one other; onely shewing the want of substance betwixt them which is lost. It may hence be obiected that many other hills and rocky places of Iland Countreyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> seeme in like manner as broken and steep downe at these <hi>clifts</hi> bounding the Ocean: as also that the <hi>clifts</hi> tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards the Sea are broken higher vp then any waies the Sea could be imagined to ascend. To this wee answer, first that rocks on the dry land many times seeme broken, when indeed they are not, being by Nature fashioned craggie and vneuen: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereas Hills in Inland countries seeme broken, this might proceede heretofore by Earthquakes which haue oftentimes beene obserued to produce such effects as it hath lately beene knowne to doe in a Towne called <hi>Pleurs</hi> in the <hi>Grisons</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey neere the <hi>Alpes:</hi> and for the appearance of such breaches in the tops of clifts aboue the ascent of the waters, it might bee caused by the violence of the Sea-waues, fretting and eating
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:8020:252"/>
out the sides of them beneath the bottome; whence it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that the higher part for want of vnder-propping must needes fall and breake off from the other. This Argument of our said Authour is by him back't with another, drawne from the name of a <hi>cliffe,</hi> which in our ancient language is drawne from cleauing or breaking off: which appellation is neuer gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to our Inland Hils, but only to such as terminate and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>passe in the Sea.

This wee call a Deluge or Inundation. The inundations which euer haue been obserued on the Earth, are of two sorts, either Vniuersall or particular: An vniuersall is that whereby the whole face of the Earth is couered with water; whereof we haue onely two examples: The first was in the first creation of the world, when (as wee read in the Scriptures) the whole face of the Earth was round inueloped with Water, which couered the tops of the highest mountaines, till such time as God by a supernaturall hand, made a separation of the Waters from the dry land: But this is improperly called an Inundation, because, the same properly taken implies as much as an ouer-flowing of that which was dry land before: The second (as we read in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis</hi>)
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:8020:254"/>
happened in the time of <hi>Noah,</hi> when God for the sinne of man, drowned the whole world, breaking open the cataracts of Heauen, and loosing the springs of the deepe.

                           </argument>
                           <p>Of the causes of Inundations many disputes haue beene a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst Naturall Philosophers: some haue trusted so farre to Nature, that they haue ascribed not only particular Inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but that vniuersall Deluge in the time of <hi>Noah</hi> to second causes: of this opinion was <hi>Henricus Mecliensis</hi> a Schollar of <hi>Albertus Magnus,</hi> who in his Commentaries vpon the great Coniunctions of <hi>Albumazar,</hi> obserued that before <hi>Noahs</hi> flood, chanced a coniunction of <hi>Iupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturne</hi> in the last degree of <hi>Cancer,</hi> against the constellation since termed <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go's ship</hi>: out of which he would needs collect, that the floud of <hi>Noah</hi> might haue beene fore-showne; because <hi>Cancer</hi> is a watry signe, and the house of the <hi>Moone</hi> being mistrisse of the Sea, and all moist bodyes according to <hi>Astrologie:</hi> which opinion was afterwards confirmed by <hi>Petrus de Alliaco,</hi> who affirmes in his Comment vpon <hi>Genesis,</hi> that although <hi>Noah</hi> did well know this flood by diuine Reuelation; yet this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction being so notable, hee could not bee ignorant of the causes thereof; for those were not only signes, but also appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant causes by vertue receiued from the first cause, which is God himselfe. Further to confirme this assertion hee would haue <hi>Moses</hi> by the <hi>cataracts</hi> of Heauen, to haue meant the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:8020:255"/>
the great &amp; watry coniunction of the Planets. A reason wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of hee seemes to alleage, because it is likely that God would shew some signe in the Heauens, by which all men might be warned to forsake their wicked courses. But notwithstanding this curious opinion, I rather cleaue to those which thinke this Deluge to be meerely Supernaturall, which I am induced to belieue for diuers causes vrged by worthy writers. First, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause this is set downe in Holy Scripture for a chiefe token or marke of <hi>Noahs</hi> extraordinary faith &amp; dependance vpon Gods promises: which had been much diminished, and of small mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, had it any way been grounded on the fore-sight of se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond causes. For this was no more then might haue beene dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered to the rest of the wicked worldlings, who no doubt would in some sort haue prouided for their safety, had they receiued any firme perswasion of this dreadfull Deluge. To which others adde a second reason, that second causes of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, without any change or alteration, are not able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce such an admirable effect as the drowning of the whole World: for it is not conuenient (say they) that God the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Nature should so dispose and direct the second causes, that they might of themselues bee able to inuert the order of the Vniuerse, and ouer-whelme the whole Earth, which hee gaue man for his habitation. But this reason is thought very weake, for as much as it seemeth to imply a new creation: The conceit of a new Creation is pronounced by a learned Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyman of ours, both vnlearned and foolish: for whereas it is written (saith hee) that the fountaines of the deepe were broken open, it cannot otherwise be vnderstood, then that the waters forsooke the very bowels of the Earth, and all whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer therein was dispersed made an eruption through the face of the Earth. Now if wee compare the height of the waters in this deluge aboue the highest mountaines, being onely 15 cubits, with the depth of the semi-diameter of the Earth to the Center, we shall not find it impossible, answering reason with reason, that all these waters dispersed vnder the Earth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should so far extend as to drowne the whole Earth: for the semi-dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the Earth (as <hi>Astronomers</hi> teach) is not aboue 35 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

miles, wherein the waters contained and dispersed, may bee sufficient for the hight of the greatest mountaines, which neuer attaine 30 miles vpright: whereas this distance of 30 miles is found in the depth of the Earth 116 times. Secondly, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tension of the Ayre being exceeding great, it might please God to condensate and thicken a great part thereof, which might concurre to this Inundation. We willingly assent to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Authour, that this Inundation might bee performed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any new creation: Notwithstanding we cannot hence col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect that it was Naturall. But to compose the difference the better, and to shew how far Nature had a hand in this admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble effect, we will thus distinguish; that an effect may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Naturall two manner of wayes: First, in regard of the causes themselues: Secondly in respect of the Direction and Application of the causes. If we consider the meere secondary and instrumentall causes, wee might call this effect Naturall, because it was partly performed by their helpe and concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence. But if we consider the mutuall application and coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of these second causes together with the first cause, which extraordinarily set them a worke, we must needs acknowledge it to be supernaturall. For other particular Inundations in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Regions we may more safely terme them Naturall, as directed and stirred vp by second causes, working no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, then according to their owne naturall disposition. Two causes concurring together, are here most notable, whereof the first is the great coniunction of watry Planets working on the water their proper subiect: the other the weaknes of the bounds and banks restraining the water, which by processe of time weare out and suffer breaches: both these causes some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times concurring together, cause an Inundation: which asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion wee may lawfully accept, but with this caution, that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God working by second causes, neuerthelesse directs them oftentimes to supernaturall and extraordinary ends.</p>

the Earth: Wherefore some <hi>Philosophers</hi> haue expressed three principall wayes which make this <hi>Earth-quake:</hi> first, when a great quantity of exhalations is suddenly ingendred, which for the greatnesse of it cannot be contained in so little a space: for then being almost choked, it seekes a way to fly forth: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, when the Earth is condensated by cold, and driues the exhalation from one place to another, which flying hither and thither, shakes and strikes the Earth: Thirdly, when the exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, the <hi>cold</hi> compassing it round by an <hi>Antiperistasis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets heat within it, and so is rarified: for so being vnable any longer to confine it selfe to its former place, it breakes forth, and so shakes the Earth: We must here note by the way, that not onely exhalations are cause of the distemperature in the Earth, but also <hi>subterranean fires</hi> and <hi>windes:</hi> all which by some are iudged to bee of equall force in this action: for the diuision of Earthquakes so farre forth as it concernes the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of <hi>places,</hi> we must vnderstand, that it may be either <hi>V<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall</hi> or <hi>particular:</hi> An <hi>Vniuersall</hi> Earth-quake is that which shakes all the whole Earth in euery part, at least in the vpper face: whereof (I suppose) no <hi>naturall</hi> cause can be giuen, but the <hi>immediate</hi> and miraculous power of God: such an Earth-quake happened at the time of our Sauiours Passion, whereof <hi>Dydimus</hi> a graue and ancient Writer left record.

                           <p>Wee must here vnderstand (as wee haue before noted) that all Nations haue a threefold originall, the first before the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall deluge, the other soone after, the later long after. For the first, no doubt can bee made by such as credit the truth of holy Scriptures, but it was from <hi>Adam</hi> the first father of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For the last, it is doubtfull and various, and therefore cannot well bee handled in generall, before wee come to the description of particular countryes; where we are determined to make a search as neere as can be into their originall: But that which we chiefly here note in the second ofspring of mankind soone after the flood: For certaine it is that all mankind was confined to the family of <hi>Noah</hi> in the <hi>Arke,</hi> so that their first originall must be drawne from the <hi>Arke,</hi> and that place where the <hi>Arke</hi> rested, presently vpon the falling of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters: which we shall proue to be far Eastward. Hence is the manifold arrogancy of many nations well discouered; for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Ancients some haue so much affected the antiquity of their race<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that forgetting their humane condition, they haue deriued their nobility from the Gods. Which humour hath not onely inuaded the minds and affections of foolish and ignorant men, but also of such as haue stood in great opinion &amp; estimation of wisdome and vertue: In so much as <hi>Caesar</hi> in a certaine oration to the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> was not ashamed to boast, that he was descended by his Fathers side from the Gods, by his mother from Kings: As also <hi>Aristotle</hi> deriued his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spring from <hi>Apollo</hi> and <hi>Aesculapius:</hi> which strange affectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was little lesse in the people of lower and baser condition, who either being vtterly ignorant of their owne ofspring, or at least dissembling it, for the hate they bore to strangers haue called themselues <gap reason="foreign">

For besides many other reasons which moued <hi>Moses</hi> to write of the <hi>Genealogies</hi> of people, this one seemes not the least, that men should vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand themselues to bee all (as it were) kinne, and descended from the same originall; then which there is no greater means to conciliate and ioyne mens affections for mutuall amitie and conuersation. As it is reported of <hi>Diomedes</hi> and <hi>Glaucus</hi> and many others, who being armed to one anothers ruine and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow, haue beene drawne to breake off their hatred by the meere pretence and shew of consanguinity. But these who so arrogantly boast themselues to bee Sonnes of the Earth, not beholding to any other countrey for their ofspring, striue to breake in sunder the bonds of society be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt nations, which<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Gods Word and the Law of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons binds vs to obserue.

Secondly, to expresse it more plainly, he aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that it was watred with a riuer springing out of a Region called <hi>Eden,</hi> being a country neare vnto <hi>Canaan</hi> in <hi>Mesopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tania</hi> as <hi>Ezechiel</hi> witnesseth.

Fourthly, it is proued by continuation of the same Story: 1 Because God gaue <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> free-will to eate of euery tree of the garden (the foresaid tree excepted:) besides he left all the beasts of the Earth to be named by him, which cannot be meant of imaginary trees and beasts: for this were to make the whole Creation <hi>aenigmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call.</hi> 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi> This name is often vsed in holy Scriptures else-where as in <hi>Ezech<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

Also why was the <hi>Angell</hi> set after <hi>Adams</hi> expulsion to barre his re en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, if it were not a <hi>particular</hi> place: for according to their opinion <hi>Adam</hi> should be driuen out of the whole World. Their second reason is, because it semes impossible that <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, Ganges,</hi> and <hi>Euphrates,</hi> by so many portions of the world so farre distant, should issue out of the same fountaine. To this we answer, that by common <hi>Interpreters</hi> of Scripture, being ignorant of <hi>Geographie, Pison</hi> was falsely taken for <hi>Ganges,</hi> &amp; <hi>Gihon</hi> for <hi>Nilus</hi>: Although it can no way be true that <hi>Ganges</hi> should be taken for a riuer by <hi>Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The third opinion is, that Paradise is higher then the <hi>Moone,</hi> or higher at least then the Middle Region of the Aire: this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is cast vpon <hi>Beda</hi> and <hi>
                                 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                                    <desc>•</desc>
                                 </gap>abanus</hi>; to which also <hi>Ruper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> seemes to accord: who (as it seemes) borrowed their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion from <hi>Plato,</hi> and he from <hi>Socrates.</hi> But these two (as it seemes) are misinterpreted, Because by Paradise they meant Heauen it selfe as many imagine. But to confirme that this ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restriall Paradise is such a place, some men produce these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments. First that it is reported by <hi>Solinus,</hi> that there is a place exceeding delightsome and healthsome on the top of Mount <hi>Athos</hi> called <hi>Acrothones,</hi> which being seated about clouds, or raine, or such inconueniences, the people by reason of their long liues are called <gap reason="foreign">
                                 <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                              </gap>. Secondly they alleage for the hight of this Paradise, that <hi>Enoch</hi> was there preserued
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:8020:263"/>
from the violence of the flood, as <hi>Isidore</hi> and <hi>Peter Lombaard</hi> maintaine: But this opinion was of the Diuines condemned in the <hi>Florentine</hi> counsell: and first where as they say, that such a pleasant place is in the top of the mountaine <hi>Athos</hi>; this nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proues that this is Paradise, neither is it so high as they would haue it: For euery high and pleasant place is not Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise. Secondly, whereas they would haue <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in the place, it is expressely against <hi>Holy Scripture,</hi> which affirmes directly that the waters ouer-flowed all the mountaines, making no such distinction. Secondly should wee credit this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we might as well beleiue that certaine Giants sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued themselues in that high place, as some haue beleiued. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides the answer of their friuolous arguments, these reasons may bee brought against their assertion: First, that such a place cannot be commodious to liue in: for being so neare the <hi>moon,</hi> it had also bin too neare the <hi>sun.</hi> Secondly, because in this sort it had bin too neare a neighbour to the Element of <hi>fire.</hi> Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because (as many hold) the <hi>Aire</hi> in that Region by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heauens is carried about so violently, as nothing there can well consist. Fourthly, because according to <hi>Ptolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,</hi> the place between the <hi>Earth</hi> and the <hi>Moone</hi> is seuenteene times the <hi>Diameter</hi> of the Earth, which make by a grosse ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compt about 120000 miles. Hence it must needs follow that Paradise being lifted vp to this great hight, must haue the compasse of the whole Earth for a <hi>basis</hi> or foundation. But this cannot be imagined: first, because it would be subiect to the eyes and knowledge of men. Secondly, it would hide the light of the <hi>Sunne</hi> for the first part of the day being on the East side. Thirdly it would ouer-poize the <hi>Earth,</hi> and so make it to shrinke out of his place; one side being farre greater and heauier then the other. The fourth conceit is of <hi>Tertullian, Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauenture,</hi> and <hi>Durandus,</hi> who would haue Paradise to bee seated vnder the <hi>Aequatour,</hi> because that contrary to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of most of all the Ancients, they thought this place to be most pleasant and commodious for habitation. It is true that the places vnder the <hi>Aequinoctial</hi> are not so burnt with the Sunne as some thought: but, as we haue proued out
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:8020:264"/>
of latter Nauigators, very pleasant and fruitfull for the most part: yet cannot this be the place of Paradise; for asmuch as the Riuers of Paradise mentioned in holy Scripture, are not found to meet there: which argument might also confute them which thought it was seated vnder the <hi>North-pole.</hi> The last o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion which I hold the truest, is of some latter Writers, that Paradise was seated in a Region South-east from <hi>Mesopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> which is most amply and copiously proued by <hi>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Walter Rawleigh,</hi> to whom I referre my Reader: only two reasons I will alleage. The first from the name of <hi>Eden,</hi> sith there is found an Iland of this name <hi>North-west</hi> from the place assig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, very fruitfull &amp; pleasant in all commodities of the Earth, and in later times knowne also by the name of <hi>Eden,</hi> which is likely to haue been continued from the beginning. Secondly from the Riuers of Paradise, which cannot be imagined to meet in any part of the world: for <hi>Tigris</hi> and <hi>Euphrates</hi> it is certaine that they are found in this very Region: for the other Riuer <hi>Gihon</hi> that it is falsely vnderstood of a Riuer running through <hi>Aethiopia</hi> is also most certaine; for such a Riuer could neuer meet with <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which is out of question one of the Riuers of Paradise: for asmuch as it is so farre dista<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t &amp; diuided from it by the Mediterranean Sea: wherefore I am constrained rather to embrace their opinion which interpret <hi>Chut</hi> to be a part of <hi>Arabia,</hi> where <hi>Chush</hi> the father of <hi>Noah</hi> se<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

But howsoeuer it be, certain it is, that Paradise was seated in the East, from whence mankind had it's first off-spring And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable it is that <hi>Adam</hi> being excluded out of Paradise, was cast into some place neare adioyning thereunto, which may also from our habitable place of the West, be accounted East<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

To the vse of gunnes and ordinance, many suppose <hi>Philostratus</hi> to haue alluded, speaking in the life of <hi>Apollonius Tiraneus lib:</hi> 2. <hi>cap:</hi> 14.

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:8020:265"/>
certaine that it was as ancient as <hi>Seth</hi>: And that <hi>Printing</hi> first came to vs, from this <hi>Easterne</hi> part, appeares by <hi>Iohn Guttem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> who brought it first out of the <hi>Easterne</hi> world: Which art <hi>Conradus</hi> being instructed in, brought the practise there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to <hi>Rome,</hi> which afterward one <hi>Gesnerus</hi> a <hi>French-man</hi> much bettered and perfected: For howsoeuer amongst the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropaeans</hi> this inuention seemed but newly borne, yet the <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nois,</hi> had it before either the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> or <hi>Phaenicians:</hi> When the <hi>Graecians</hi> had neither knowledg nor <hi>ciuility</hi>: which is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed aboue a hundred yeares gone by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Portugalls.</hi> Farther for the <hi>magnificence</hi> of those nations, an argument may bee drawne from the History of <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, who found more stately <hi>buildings</hi> and <hi>Cities</hi> in the little kingdome of <hi>Porus</hi> which lay side by side against the <hi>East-Indies,</hi> then in all his former trauailes: for in <hi>Alexanders</hi> time <hi>learning</hi> &amp; <hi>ciuility</hi> were not spread so farre <hi>west</hi> as <hi>Rome:</hi> Neither did he esteeme of <hi>Italy</hi> any otherwise, then of a <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous</hi> and <hi>vnciuill</hi> place: which made him to turne his army rather against <hi>Babilon</hi> and the <hi>east,</hi> which seemed a farre wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier prize: Moreouer, <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> shewes that letters and discipline was first borrowed from the <hi>easterne</hi> people, without any returne of interest. A third reason may bee from the extraordinary strength of those <hi>easterne</hi> people in most ancient times. For it is reported by <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> out of <hi>Clesias</hi> that <hi>Semiramis</hi> the wife of <hi>Ninus,</hi> not many discents from <hi>Noah,</hi> brought an army to inuade <hi>India</hi>

Then it is manifest that the first <hi>Plantation</hi> of nations begunne in the <hi>easterne</hi> parts of the Earth: But where we shall place and define this Easterne part, seemes a matter of greater difficulty then the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

For to iudge indifferently of either, they are both vices declining from that golden mediocrity, which wee call Constancy. For the defect is leuity, the excesse Pertinacy: and as it is very culpable in any man to turne with euery winde; so it is as great an indiscretion, to be so wedded to our owne opinions or affections as to turne on no occasion: Because all things vnder the sunne are subiect to change and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And therefore it is the part of a wise man to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date himselfe vnto the obiect, and not in a fond dreame to wrest all the world to his owne fancy. For a wise Sea-man will rather obey the storme then seeke his ruine, and when he cannot recouer the port, will turne to any other point for his owne preseruation. I speake here onely of matters of state and policy, and not of religious actions, otherwise then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne the externall rites and Ecclesiasticall discipline, the most part of which, by wise men haue been esteemed no other, then matters indifferent which may admit of change &amp; alteration. But here some one might obiect that the <hi>French</hi> of all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, haue been generally taxed of lightnesse and inconstancy, being notwithstanding in the middle region, more <hi>North</hi> then the <hi>Africans,</hi> yet more <hi>South</hi> then the <hi>Germans</hi> or <hi>Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians</hi>; I cannot altogether excuse them of this Nationall ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish, yet with their countreyman <hi>Bodin,</hi> I hold it more fitly tearmed temerity then leuity, being a people very quicke and agill, as well in speech, as action in so much as the executions

                           <p>Another difference betwixt the Northerne and Southerne man is discouered in the Affection of Anger and Reuenge. The <hi>Northerne</hi> man though quickly moued to anger, and very furious, prouokes his enemy to the open field, and after a little time is quickly pacified, forgetting the iniury. The <hi>Southerne</hi> man contrarywise is not so quickly in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

A proofe whereof wee haue in most men amongst vs, of a melancholy disposition, which according to our common prouerbe, threaten danger and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred implacable: of this disposition were <hi>Aiax</hi> and M. <hi>Corio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanus,</hi> whereof the former for want of reuenge, in a distracted fury fell on the heards of cattle: the other would by no meanes be reconciled to his Countreymen, till he saw all their Cities in flames. Of the cruelty of the <hi>Africans</hi> many histories haue giuen testimonies, especially <hi>Leo Afer,</hi> speaking of the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> dissention: and with later Writers most memorable is the story of miserable <hi>Mulleasses</hi> deposed of his Crowne, his eyes burnt out, and his face disfigured, tendring his complaint to the Emperour <hi>Charles.</hi> This cruelty hath no lesse been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued in the most Southerne <hi>Ameri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:8020:280"/>
And if we examine the originall of tortures and seuere lawes, we shall find them originally deriued from the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erne people, which the Northerne Man hath seldome vsed but vnwillingly in matters of horrible treason. And not without good reason haue our Lawes taken other courses for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiction of malefactors in cases of fellony and murther, then the extortion of confession by extreame tortures, a thing common with the <hi>Italian</hi>; because (as some of our Statists haue obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) our Nation is by nature more apt to confession without torture, and so fearefull of torment, that they will more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly be brought to the blocke or gallowes, then the racke: whereas the Southerne people by their melancholy temper more fearefull of death, and obstinate in their opinion, will yeeld rather to the greatest torture then confession.</p>
                           <p>Thirdly we shall find as great a disparity betwixt the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne</hi> and <hi>Southerne</hi> man in the sluttish carelesnesse of the one, and the cleanly neatnesse of the other. <hi>Tacitus</hi> reports of the old <hi>Germans,</hi> that they liued at home in their houses in sordide manner, almost naked, and that they vsed the same roomes as receptacles as well of their beasts as of themselues: which custome we shall not find much changed amongst some, if we read <hi>Lipsius</hi> speaking of the <hi>Westphalians,</hi> or haue so much patience elsewhere to make experiment. It is also reported that the <hi>Scythians</hi> whensoeuer they found themselues oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed on the way, or in the wars by hunger or thirst, were wont to open a veine vnder their horses eares, and to sucke out their bloud, and to banquet with the flesh, as we read of <hi>Tamerlanes</hi> Army on the like occasion: but the <hi>Southerne</hi> people are of a neat and cleanly disposition, abhorring all sordide and vnclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly action, vsing often bathings &amp; washings, not only in sacred and Ecclesiasticall matters, but also in priuate. And therefore no wonder if (as <hi>Xenophon</hi> among the Ancients reports) that amongst the <hi>Persians</hi> it were accompted a very vnmannerly thing to spit; or that amongst the <hi>Abyssines</hi> (as <hi>Aluarez</hi> writes) it should bee deemed a most hainous and flagitious crime, to drop any filth or spittle in any of their temples. An ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of this may be their extraordinary affection of neat &amp;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:8020:281"/>
dainty delicates, which (as <hi>Athen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony</hi> a luxurious spend-thrift, finding himselfe by <hi>Cleopatra</hi> surmounted, he smiled at his owne ambition in that kinde, and laughed at the <hi>Romans</hi> his owne Nation as ignorant and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Of the <hi>Persian Theophrastus</hi> writes, that by a certaine Law certaine great rewards were promised to such men as had inuented any new kindes of Delicates or pleasures, which is a great argument of the licorous affection of this Nation. A fourth difference may be discouered in the conuersation of the <hi>Northerne</hi> and <hi>Southerne</hi> Man. For the <hi>Scythian</hi> and <hi>Northerne</hi> man is naturally addicted to company and society, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by the communion of many men in one place in the fields, who amongst the ancients were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But the <hi>Southerne</hi> man being (as we haue proued) of a melancholy disposition, chuseth rather to liue solitary, and to lurke in woods and desarts, then amongst people: Neere to which nature come the <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who affect rather a retired Grauity, then an open Society<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and conuerse but at a distance, rather for formality the friendship<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 5<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>, no lesse disparity in the disposition of these nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons shall we find aswel in the Languages they ordinarily vse, as the kinds of musicke which they affects for the former we may generally obserue in the <hi>Northerne</hi> Languages a rough collisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of consonants and aspirations, as in the <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian</hi> Tongues.

For these which more neerely incline to the one then the other, it will bee apparant that as they approach the one in one quality, so they are farther off in another: as if they approach neerer in contemplatiue wit to the <hi>Southerne</hi> people, so will they come so farre short of the <hi>Northerns</hi> valour.

                           <p>For demonstration of this point wee need not spend much time; first, it is manifest that this Hemispheare was peopled a long time before the other, which is a probable argument of their culture and ciuility: because all these matters haue com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly their growth &amp; perfection with Time, the mother of all perfection. That this part was peopled a long time before the other, is most credible: for it is plaine out of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that the first off-spring of mankind was in <hi>Asia</hi>; whence it could not disperse it selfe into <hi>America</hi> and other parts of
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:8020:283"/>
the Earth, till such time as their populous growth had requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red larger bounds. The passage from <hi>Asia</hi> into <hi>America</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt had been performed either by sea or land. By Sea it was improbable they should aduenture in that infancy of the World, when the Art of Nauigation was in her swathing bands, and neither the Chart or Compasse as yet inuented. If by land they made their passage, it was doubtlesse through the North of <hi>Asia,</hi> supposing <hi>America</hi> with <hi>Asia</hi> to bee one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent. But this people comming out of a pleasant and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Countrey, would without question first attempt the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the like quality, as most pleasing their eye, and fitting their disposition, before they would inforce their passage to the Icy and frozen Climates of the <hi>North,</hi> which can only bee beholding to necessity for habitation. Hence without doubt it came to passe, that those Nations wandring farre from their first fountaine, and leauing no sufficient monument to instruct their posterity in their first originall, came short of the other, as well in reuealed as acquired knowledge in reuealed know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, either sought in Holy Scriptures, or Traditions, they could not but come short; as being most distant from the first head and fountaine where it was to be found in greatest perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. In <hi>Acquired</hi> knowledge gotten by industry and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience they could not come so farre as the other; because all such knowledge hauing its beginning from obseruation, and its growth with age, could not bee brought to that perfection amongst them, who came more lately to bee a people, and scarce euer endowed with any settled gouernment: but what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer the causes may bee thought of this diuersity betwixt the people of the <hi>Westerne</hi> and <hi>Easterne</hi> Hemispheare, certaine I am that the effect it selfe is most apparant.

First there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what can speake more, for the witty temper of the <hi>moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine</hi> people, then their <hi>cleare</hi> and <hi>subtile Aire</hi> being farre more purged and rarified, then that in <hi>low</hi> countries: For
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:8020:287"/>
holding the <hi>vitall spirits</hi> to bee the chiefest instruments in the soules operation, no man can deny but they sympathrize, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially with the <hi>aire</hi> their chiefest foment. Euery man may by experience finde his <hi>intellectuall</hi> operations more vigorous in a <hi>cleare</hi> day, and on the contrary most dull and heauy when the aire is any way affected with foggy vapours. What wee finde in our selues in the same place at diuerse seasons, may we much more expect of places, diuersely affected in <hi>constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi> A second reason for the proofe of our assertion, may bee drawne from the <hi>thinne</hi> and <hi>spare diet,</hi> in respect of those o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Forpeople liuing on <hi>plaines,</hi> haue commonly all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities in such plenty, that they are much subiect to <hi>surfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting</hi> and <hi>luxurie,</hi> the greatest <hi>enemy</hi> and vnderminer of all <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectuall</hi> operations. For a <hi>fat-belly</hi> commonly begets a <hi>grosse head,</hi> and a <hi>leane braine:</hi> But want and scarcity the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of frugality, inuites the mountaine dwellers to a more sparing and wholsome diet. Neither growes this conuenience onely out of the scarcity of viandes, but also out of the nature of the diet. <hi>Birds, Fowles</hi> and <hi>Beasts,</hi> which are bred vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>higher</hi> places, are esteemed of a more cleanely and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some feeding, then others liuing in <hi>fennes</hi> and foggy places: And how farre the quality of our <hi>diet</hi> preuailes in the altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our <hi>organs</hi> and <hi>dispositions</hi>; euery naturalist will easily resolue vs. A third reason may bee drawne from the <hi>cold Aire</hi> of these mountanous regions, which by an <hi>Antiperistasis</hi> keepes in, and strengthens the internall heat, the chiefe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument in <hi>naturall</hi> and <hi>vitall</hi> operations. For who per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiues not his vitall, and by consequence his intellectuall parts, in cold frosty weather to be more strong and vigorous, then in hot and soultry seasons, wherein the spirits are more diffused and weakened. This disparity in the same region, at diuerse times, in regard of the disposition of the aire, may easily declare the disparity of diuerse Regions, being in this sort diuersely affected. A fourth reason may bee taken from the customary <hi>hardnesse,</hi> whereunto such people inure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues from their infancy; which (as <hi>Huartus</hi> proues) begets a better temper of the braine, in regard of the wit and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing;

Finally such haue beene the alterations of this people, that being heretofore farre <hi>North</hi> and <hi>branded</hi> with all the markes of <hi>Northerne rudenesse,</hi> they are now estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the Catalogue of <hi>Southerne Inhabitants</hi>: Not in regard, as much of <hi>place,</hi> as <hi>nature.</hi> The like may wee obserue of the <hi>Turkes</hi> and <hi>Tartars,</hi> who spreading their empire from the <hi>North</hi> towards the <hi>South,</hi> a long time retained their rude bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous <hi>nature,</hi> which they haue not at this day altogether cast off; yet so much hath time and place gained vpon their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that they are much mollified and farre more tractable to <hi>humanity,</hi> addicting themselues euery day more and more to the study of <hi>artes</hi> and <hi>ciuility:</hi> in so much that (as one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serues) had they not preserued their strict <hi>discipline</hi> in training vp their youth to <hi>armes,</hi> they had long since lost much of their large empire, and haue yeelded to the <hi>Polonian</hi> and <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uite.</hi> This change may we find not onely in <hi>mankinde,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so in <hi>beasts</hi> and <hi>plants,</hi> which being transported into other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions, though a long time retaining their natiue perfection, will notwithstanding in time by little and little degenerate: As I haue heard by relation of some of our <hi>Virginian</hi> colony in <hi>America</hi>: who finde a great alteration in our Corne and Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, translated thither.

                           </argument>
                           <p>This proposition is by naturall consequence deduced from the former: Because all <hi>Colonies</hi> transplanted retaining some-what of their former nature, the <hi>Mixture</hi> must pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>variety.</hi> First, because the <hi>number</hi> of people of any regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by this is supposed to consist of more kindes of dispositions: Secondly, because the promiscuous <hi>mixture</hi> of these kindes being vnequally tempered, must according to their seuerall combinations produce people, as vnlike one to the other, as to the former. Hence a reason may bee giuen, why the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the <hi>extreame</hi> regions, either <hi>North</hi> or <hi>South</hi> are found to bee amongst themselues as well in <hi>temper,</hi> as in externall <hi>face</hi> and habite more like one to the other: whereas the <hi>mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle</hi> partake of more variety. For the <hi>Cimbrians, Danes,</hi> and other <hi>Scythians,</hi> are for the most part of a <hi>whitish</hi> hue, with flaxen, and yellow <hi>haire</hi>; on the other side the <hi>Ethiopians</hi> for the most part are <hi>blacke-haired</hi> and <hi>curled.</hi> The <hi>French, Germans,</hi> and the <hi>English,</hi> admit of all variety, hauing some <hi>white-haired,</hi> some <hi>black,</hi> some <hi>yellow,</hi> some <hi>tawny,</hi> some <hi>smooth</hi> and some <hi>curled-pates.</hi> This diuersity the <hi>Stoicks</hi> would as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to the <hi>phantasie,</hi> or image conceiued in the minds of men. Whence they would giue a cause, why beasts commonly

bring forth yong, more like one the other then men; because (say they) wanting a <hi>reasonable</hi> soule they are not stirred vp as men with sundry cogitations, but onely with sense. So the <hi>Scit hian</hi> and <hi>Northerne</hi> man being by nature more <hi>simple,</hi> and affecting those pleasures which are agreeable to nature, and lesse distracted by variety of thoughts, is found to beget children more like their parents then those of the <hi>middle cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</hi> This cause wee should admit probable enough, but for a reason vrged by <hi>Bodin</hi> and others, that in <hi>Aethiopia,</hi> where the people of all other is more <hi>Acute,</hi> and more <hi>vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent</hi> in lust, they are most like one to the other. For euen all are found to be <hi>small</hi> of stature, <hi>curle-pated, black-skinned, flat-nosed, smooth-skinned, great-lip't, white-toothed, black-eyed:</hi> Wherefore this infinite diuersity in the middle region, we cannot well ascribe to any other reason, then the manifold <hi>intermixtion</hi> and <hi>combination</hi> of both the <hi>extreames.</hi> Whence it comes to passe, that by how much more we wander from the <hi>middle region,</hi> so much the more shall wee finde the people amongst themselues: In so much as <hi>Tacitus</hi> spake of the <hi>Germans,</hi> that amongst themselues they were very like in respect of other nations. This mixture in the <hi>middle regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> out of the <hi>extreames,</hi> may easily be shewed out of diuerse <hi>Colonies,</hi> which from the <hi>extreames,</hi> haue beene translated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>middle region,</hi> as the better place of habitation. For hither came the great and extraordinary armies of the <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Gothes, Turkes</hi> and <hi>Tartars</hi>; None besides the <hi>Vandalls</hi> passed into <hi>Africke,</hi> from whence they were in short time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsed. The <hi>Arabians</hi> and <hi>Punicaeans</hi> called by the ancient <hi>Saracens,</hi> leading their Colonies into <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> setled themselues in the <hi>middle</hi> region; None came into <hi>Scythia:</hi> for when they had inuaded <hi>Spaine, Italy</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> they were in <hi>France</hi> altogether broken, and cut off: After which, <hi>Spaine</hi> and <hi>Italy</hi> found a meanes to free themselues from their bondage. Likewise the Colonyes of the <hi>Celtes</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> endeauoured alwaies to settle themselues in the <hi>middle Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and neuer ventured as farre as <hi>Scythia</hi> Northward, or Southward as farre as <hi>Aethiopia:</hi> Whence the <hi>middle</hi> charged

with intermixture of both <hi>extreames</hi> begat a great diuersity. For we find by experience, that out of the mixture of diuerse <hi>kinds,</hi> diuerse <hi>Formes</hi> and <hi>Natures</hi> are ingendred: As of the <hi>Mule, Leopard, Crocuta, Lycisca,</hi> and <hi>Camelopardus</hi>; which being <hi>mixt</hi> Creatures are vnlike their Sires: So may we iudge of the various mixture of diuerse kinds of men. A <hi>Mastiffe</hi> or <hi>Lycisca,</hi> little differs from a <hi>Wolfe,</hi> because he was conceiued of a <hi>Wolfe</hi> and a <hi>Dogge</hi>; So that a <hi>Wolfe</hi> is (as <hi>Varro</hi> noteth) nothing else then a <hi>wilde Dogge.</hi> But on the other side, a <hi>Mule</hi> from an <hi>Asse</hi> and a <hi>Horse,</hi> As a <hi>Camelopardus</hi> from a <hi>Panthor</hi> and a <hi>Camell,</hi> differ very much; so that if people very neere in <hi>Nature</hi> be linckt together, they produce an of-spring very like themselues: But if two very vnlike in nature, as an <hi>Ethiopian</hi> and a <hi>Scythian</hi> should match together, they must needs bring forth a birth very vnlike to themselues: like a <hi>Personated man</hi> brought vpon the stage by <hi>Ptolomaeus Philedephus,</hi> who (as <hi>Athenaeus</hi> writes) was of two colours, on one side <hi>white,</hi> on the other <hi>blacke.</hi>

The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients amongst the <hi>French</hi> (as <hi>Bodin</hi> testifies) deemed a long visage the most handsome: Whence the Midwiues endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to frame most faces to this fashion, as may bee seene in most ancient statues and images.

But <hi>time</hi> and <hi>discipline</hi> preuailing against <hi>barbarisme,</hi> they are (God be praised) reduced to such a height of civility, that they may (as it were) reade other mens wantes in their owne perfections, and measure other mens losse by their owne gaines.

accidentall: For as much as nothing spurres on a true reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution more then a <hi>good conscience,</hi> and a true touch of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: witnesse the holy <hi>Martyrs</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> of all ages, whose valour and constancy hath outgone all heathen presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. But because souldiers for the most part, being a most dissolute kinde of people, hauing either a <hi>false religion</hi> which can suggest no setled resolution, or an ill conscience grounded vpon no assurance, <hi>Religion</hi> must needs beget in them a more fearefull disposition. Another cause may bee the seuerity of discipline, which especially in the training vp of youth, is mixed with a kind of slauery: without which our yonger yeers are very vntractable to tast the bitter roots of <hi>knowledge.</hi> This <hi>feare</hi> (as it were) stamped in our affections cannot but leaue behind it a continuall impression, which cannot sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainly bee razed out. Such as we find in vs of our <hi>masters</hi> and <hi>teachers,</hi> whose <hi>friendship</hi> we rather imbrace, then <hi>familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> A third reason, why discipline would weaken and molli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a Nation, may be the delight which men reape in <hi>Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>platiue</hi> studies, and <hi>morall</hi> or <hi>politicke</hi> duties, whence followes a neglect of the other. For people of <hi>knowledge</hi> must needs finde a greater felicity in giftes of the minde, which is vsual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seconded with a contempt of externall and military affaires. The last cause may bee the want of vse and practise of military affaires in most common-wealths; for many states well esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished continue a long time without warres, neither mole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting their neighbours, nor dissenting amongst themselues; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept very seldome, and that by a small army, without troub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the whole state: whence the generall practise be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lesse knowne, becomes more fearefull. Notwithstanding, all this it were brutish to imagine <hi>discipline</hi> any way <hi>vnne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary</hi> or <hi>hurtfull,</hi> either to a <hi>Captaine</hi> or <hi>Statesman.</hi> For as much as it more strengthens the <hi>wit</hi> then abates the courage of a nation. Neither is it properly said to breake and weaken, but rather to temper and regulate our spirits. For it is not <hi>valour,</hi> but rather <hi>rashnesse</hi> or <hi>fiercenesse,</hi> which is not managed with <hi>policy</hi> and discretion. And although it hath sometimes beene attended with notable exploites, as that of <hi>Alexander</hi>
                              <pb n="286" facs="tcp:8020:301"/>
the <hi>great,</hi> of the <hi>Gothes,</hi> the <hi>ancient Gaules</hi> and many other. Yet shall we obserue such conquests, to bee of small continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: For what they atcheiued by <hi>strength,</hi> they lost for want of <hi>policy.</hi> So that it is well said by one: that <hi>moderation</hi> is the mother of <hi>continuance,</hi> to <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Kingdomes.</hi> Thus haue we run ouer (by Gods assistance) the chiefe <hi>causes</hi> of diuersity of <hi>dispositions</hi> of Nations: Wherein if any man will informe himselfe (as hee should) hee must compare one circumstance with another, and make his iudgement not from a <hi>man</hi> but a nation; and not censure any Nation out of <hi>one</hi> obseruation: For <hi>practise</hi> in <hi>Art</hi> cannot alwayes come home to <hi>speculation.</hi> So <hi>experience</hi> in this kinde will oftentimes crosse the most gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall <hi>rules</hi> wee can imagine. Tis enough to iudge as wee finde, and walke where the way is open; If any man will desire more curiosity, hee may spend more labour to lesse purpose. Let euery man by beholding the <hi>nationall vices</hi> of other men, praise Almighty God for his owne happinesse: and by seeing their vertues, learne to correct his owne vices. So should our trauaile in this Terrestriall Globe bee our direct way to Heauen: And that eternall guide should conduct vs which can neuer erre: To whom be ascribed all Glory, Prayse, and Power, for euermore.</p>
