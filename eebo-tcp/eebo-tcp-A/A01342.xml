            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>But see the troups, see how they march along:</l>
            <l>Where severall ranks and orders make a throng</l>
            <l>Promiscuously blended; sex and age,</l>
            <l>Nation and language jointly do engage</l>
            <l>Their devout forces to redresse thy woes,</l>
            <l>Ierusalem, ravisht by barbarous foes.</l>
            <l>Peter the Monk, leaving his sullen cell,</l>
            <l>His Beads, and Offices, and every spell</l>
            <l>Of his mysterious zeal, breaks forth at last</l>
            <l>To kindle all the world with fat all blast.</l>
            <l>First Kings proceed; and Captains follow them:</l>
            <l>The helmet waits upon the diadem.</l>
            <l>The next are Prelates; who stray farre from home</l>
            <l>To winne the glorious name of Martyrdome.</l>
            <l>Since all their mild perswasions could not work</l>
            <l>Upon th'obdurate Antichristian Turk,</l>
            <l>They will at length (if nought prevent their plot)</l>
            <l>Confute his Alcoran with sword and shot.</l>
            <l>After those reverend men, whose cloven mitres</l>
            <l>Speak them not warriours so much as writers,</l>
            <l>A bald-pate regiment of Friars comes;</l>
            <l>Whose crowns might serve the army for their drums,</l>
            <l>And give as full a sound, if you'l confesse</l>
            <l>The greatest noise t'arise from emptinesse.</l>
            <l>Then moves the main Battalia, straitly knit</l>
            <l>Into a steadie <hi>Phalanx,</hi> square, but fit</l>

            <l>March on: For the shrill trumpet and the fife,</l>
            <l>Your tongues may serve; then to secure your life</l>
            <l>You need no weapons, every face and eye</l>
            <l>Carrieth sufficient artillerie.</l>
            <l>A slender company doth next succeed:</l>
            <l>Call it the <hi>Infantrie</hi>; 'tis so indeed.</l>
            <l>As if the driving of the Turks away</l>
            <l>From Christian cities, were but childrens play.</l>
            <l>The last in this Religious army crawls</l>
            <l>A band collected out of Hospitals</l>
            <l>And Spittles. One would think this piteous sight</l>
            <l>Did rather come from warre then go to fight.</l>
            <l>Their commendation's this, How-e're the day</l>
            <l>Shall chance to prove, they'l hardly run away.</l>
            <l>This is the totall muster. Let the book</l>
            <l>Tell their atchievements: Mean time as you look</l>
            <l>Vpon this Frontispice, you'l plainly see</l>
            <l>Their dismall end and sad Catastrophe.</l>
            <l>Th'incensed Angel with his flaming blade</l>
            <l>Great slaughter of perfidious souls hath made.</l>
            <l>To teach us truth and justice, see how God</l>
            <l>Scourges their falshood with a fiery rod.</l>
            <l>Then the grand Signor his proud fauchion stretches</l>
            <l>With domineering hand over the wretches</l>
            <l>Low prostrate at his foot. Can Christian eyes</l>
            <l>Endure this figure! Let the captives rise,</l>
            <l>Surly black Saracen; their bended knee</l>
            <l>Has higher objects then to reverence thee:</l>
            <l>They serve a Lord greater then Mahomet.</l>
            <l>Though now their sunne be darken'd and beset</l>
            <l>With clouds of disadvantage, time will be</l>
            <l>When such poore things shall triumph over thee;</l>
            <l>And their old prophecie shall be made good,</l>
            <l>Thy <hi>Moon shall</hi> then <hi>be turned into bloud.</hi>
            </l>

            <l>Sicknesse and casualty on either hand,</l>

            <l>Those that escap'd, came home as full of grief</l>
            <l>As the poore Purse is empty of relief.</l>
            <l>They're turn'd, and so is it; but nothing in't,</l>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen I observe the severall alterations in No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie, I find foure principall actours on the theatres of great Families; the Beginner, Advancer, Continuer, and Ruiner. The Beginner is he who by his vertues refineth himself from the drosse of the vulgar, and layeth the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his house: An excellent workman indeed, as who not onely bringeth his tools, but maketh his materialls. The Advancer, who improveth the patrimonie of Honour he receiveth; and what his Father found glasse and made crystall, he findeth crystall and maketh it pearl. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuer, who keepeth his Nobilitie alive, and passeth it along neither marring nor mending it; but sendeth it to his Sonne as he received it from his Father. The Ruiner, who base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly degenerateth from his Ancestours; so that in him Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie hath runne so farre from its first starting, that it is tired: and whilest he liveth he is no better then his Grandfathers tombe; without, carved over with honourable titles; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, full of emptinesse, or what is worse, corruption.</p>
            <p>Now to apply. You cannot be Beginners of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; that care was cared for before your nurses were
<pb facs="tcp:21984:4"/>
chosen, or your cradles provided. Your Fathers, though of late yeares fixed in a higher Sphear, were bright Starres long before. None can go on in our English Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but they must meet with a <hi>Montagu</hi> and a <hi>Powlet,</hi> either in peace in their gowns, or in warre in their armour. Yea, when I go backward by the streams of your Paternall Nobilitie, (not to speak of the tributarie brooks of their matches) I can never find the first fountain; and hope none shall ever find the last fall. For as for the ruiners of houses, I should rend that thought out with my heart, if it should conceive that of you. Nay, let me tell you; if you be but bare continuers of your Honour, you deceive both the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires and hopes of your friends. Good is not good when proceeding from them from whom farre better is expected. Your youthfull vertues are so promising, that you cannot come off in your riper age with credit without performing what may redound to the advancing of the honour of your family, and without building your houses one storie higher in the English Historie.</p>
            <p>Now know, next Religion, there is nothing accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a man more then Learning. Learning in a Lord, is as a diamond in gold. And if you fear to hurt your tender hands with thornie School-questions, there is no danger in meddling with History, which is a velvet-study, &amp; recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-work. What a pitie is it to see a proper Gentleman to have such a crick in his neck that he cannot look backward! yet no better is he who cannot see behind him the actions which long since were performed. History maketh a young man to be old, without either wrinkles or gray hairs; privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him with the experience of age, without either the
<pb facs="tcp:21984:4"/>
infirmities or inconveniences thereof. Yea, it not onely maketh things past, present; but inableth one to make a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall conjecture of things to come. For this world afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth no new accidents, but in the same sense wherein we call it <hi>a new Moon,</hi> which is the old one in another shape, and yet no other then what hath been formerly. Old actions return again, furbished over with some new and different circumstances.</p>
            <p>Now amongst all particular histories (I may say) none is more generall then this of the Holy warre, which now I present to your Honours. Some will condemn me for an ill husband, in lavishing two Noble Patrones on one book, whereas one of them might have served to have patronized many volumes. But first, I did it in the weak expression of my thankfulnesse unto you, being deeply indebted to you both; and I thought it dishonestie to pay all to one cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditour and none to another; and therefore conceived it best, to share my estate joyntly betwixt you, as farre forth as it would extend. Secondly, considering the weaknesse of this Work, now being to walk abroad in the world, I thought it must be led by both arms, and needed a double supporter. And now I am sure this Holy warre, which was unhappie heretofore, when acted; will be happie hereafter, now writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and related, because dedicated to your Honours. So resteth</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N this work I can challenge nothing to my self, but the composing of it. The materialls were found to my hand: which if any Historian will make, let him not be commended for wit, but shamed for falshood. If every-where I have not charged the margin with the Authours names, it is either because the storie is authour for it self (I mean, generally received) or to avoyd the often citing of the same place. Where I could not go abroad my self, there I have taken aire at the window, and have cited Authours on others citations; yet so that the stream may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect to the fountain.</p>
            <p>If the reader may reap in few houres what cost me more moneths, just cause have I to rejoyce, and he (I hope) none to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain. Thus may the faults of this book redound to my self, the profit to others, the glory to God.</p>

            <l>To conquer and recover't from the Turk:</l>
            <l>'Tis done already: FVLLERS learned work</l>

            <l>Ierusalem with darknesse long beset,</l>
            <l>Captiv'd to time more then to Mahomet,</l>
            <l>Inthrall'd to silence and oblivion</l>
            <l>(A bondage worse then that of Babylon)</l>
            <l>Is now redeem'd. Lo, by this sacred Story</l>
            <l>How she revives into her ancient glory!</l>
            <l>Look, how her bury'd pinnacles 'gin to peep</l>
            <l>Out of their venerable dust and sleep!</l>
            <l>See, how the Temple and the Sepulchre,</l>
            <l>Wak'd with the trumpet of this Holy warre</l>
            <l>From their own grave and ruines, do resent</l>

            <l>Set up your rest here in this Holy warre.</l>
            <l>Here you may visit and adore the Shrine</l>

            <lg>
               <l>CAptain of Arts, in this thy Holy warre</l>
               <l>My Muse desires to be thy Trumpeter,</l>
               <l>In thy just praise to spend a blast or two:</l>
               <l>For this is all that she (poore thing) can do.</l>

                  <hi>Peter</hi> the Hermite, like an angry owl,</l>
               <l>Would needs go fight all armed in his cowl.</l>
               <l>What, had the Holy man nought else to do,</l>
               <l>But thus to lose his bloud and credit too?</l>
               <l>Seeking to winne Christs Sepulchre, God wot,</l>
               <l>He found his own: This was the ground he got.</l>
               <l>Except he got more ground, when he one day</l>
               <l>Besieging Antioch fiercely ran away.</l>
               <l>Much wiser was the Pope: At home he stay'd,</l>
               <l>And made the world beleeve he wept and pray'd.</l>
               <l>Mean while (behold the fruit of feigned tears)</l>
               <l>He sets the world together by the cares.</l>
               <l>His head serves him, whil'st others use their hands:</l>
               <l>Whil'st Princes lose their lives, he gets their lands.</l>
               <l>To winne the Holy land what need Kings roam?</l>
               <l>The Pope can make an Holy land at home</l>
               <l>By making it his own: Then for a fashion,</l>
               <l>'Tis said to come by Constantines donation.</l>
               <l>For all this Fox-craft, I have leave (I hope)</l>
               <l>To think my friend farre wiser then the Pope</l>
               <l>And Hermite both: He deals in Holy warres</l>
               <l>Not as a stickler in those fruitlesse jarres,</l>
               <l>But a composer rather. Hence this book;</l>
               <l>Whereon whil'st I with greedie eyes do look,</l>
               <l>Me thinks I travel through the Holy land,</l>
               <l>Viewing the sacred objects on each hand.</l>
               <l>Here mounts (me thinks) like Olivet, brave sense;</l>
               <l>There flows a Iordan of pure eloquence:</l>
               <l>A Temple rich in ornament I find</l>
               <l>Presented here to my admiring mind.</l>
               <l>Strange force of Art! The ruin'd Holy citie</l>
               <l>Breeds admiration in me now, not pitie.</l>
               <l>To testifie her liking, here my Muse</l>
               <l>Makes solemn Vows, as Holy Pilgrimes use.</l>
               <l>I vow, deare friend, the Holy warre is here</l>
               <l>Farre better writ then ever fought elsewhere.</l>

                  <hi>Out of Iacob shall a starre arise</hi>; though he proved but a fading comet, whose blazing portended the ruine of that nation. The captives, by order from Adrian, were transported into Spain; the countrey laid waste, which parted with her peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and fruitfulnesse both together. Indeed pilgrimes to this day here and there light on parcels of rich ground in Palestine: which God may seem to have left, that men may tast the former sweetnesse of the land, before it was sowred for the peoples sinnes; and that they may guesse the goodnesse of the cloth by the finenesse of the shreds. But it is barren for the generality: the streams of milk and hony wherewith once it flowed, are now drained dry; and the <note n="*" place="margin">

much for want of dressing, as because God hath frowned on it. Yet great was the oversight of Adrian, thus totally to unpeople a province, and to bequeath it to foxes and leopards. Though his memory was excellent, yet here he forgot the old Romanes rule, who to prevent desolations, where they rooted out the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, planted in colonies of their own people. And surely the countrey recovered not a competencie of inhabitants for some hundred yeares after. For though many pilgrimes came thither in after-ages, yet they came rather to visit then to dwell: and such as remained there, most embracing single lives, were no breeders for posterity. If any say that Adrian did wilfully neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this land, and prostitute it to ruine for the rebellion of the people; yet all account it small policie in him, in punishing the Jews to hurt his own empire, and by this vastation to leave fair and clear footing for forrein enemies to fasten on this countrey, and from thence to invade the neighbouring dominions: as after the Persians and Saracens easily overran and dispeopled Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine; and no wonder if a thin medow were quickly mown. But to return to the Jews; Such stragglers of them, not conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in number, as escaped this banishment into Spain (for few hands reap so clean as to leave no gleanings) were forbidden to enter into Jerusalem, or so much as to behold it from any rise or advantage of ground. <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>THus the main bodie of the Jews was brought into Spain, and yet they stretched their out-limbes into every countrey: so that it was as hard to find a populous citie without a common sink, as without a company of Jews. They grew fat on the barest pasture, by usurie and brokage; though often squeezed by those Christians amongst whom they lived, counting them dogs, and therefore easily finding a stick to beat them. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes

in any tumult, when the fense of order was broken, the Jews lay next harms: as at the coronation of Richard the first, when the English made great feasts, but the pillaged Jews paid the shot.<note place="margin">

But had these two latter kings banished all Jewish bloud out of their countreys, they must have emptied the veins of their best subjects, as descended from them. Still they are found in great numbers in Turkie; chiefly in Salonichi, where they enjoy the freest slavery:<note place="margin">

Lastly, they are thick in the Popes dominions, where they are kept as a testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie of the truth of the Scriptures, and foyl to Christianitie, but chiefly in pretense to convert them. But his Holinesse his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting facultie worketh the strongest at the greatest distance: for the Indians he turneth to his religion, and these Jews he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verteth to his profit. Some are of opinion of the generall cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Jews: and no doubt those who dissent from them in their judgements, concurre in their wishes and desires. Yet are there three grand hindrances of their conversion: First, the offense taken and given by the Papists amongst whom they live, by their worshipping of images, the Jews being zelots in the second commandment: Secondly, because on their conversion they must <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>BUt the sinnes of the Eastern countreys, and chiefly their damnable heresies, hastened Gods judgements upon them. In these Western parts, heresies like an angle caught single per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons; which in Asia, like a drag-net, took whole provinces<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The stayed and settled wits of Europe were not easily removed out of the old rode and tract of religion, whiles the active and nimble heads of the East were more desirous of novelties, more cunning to invent distinctions to cozen themselves with, more fluent in language to expresse their conceits, as alwayes errours grow the fastest in hot brains. Hence it came to passe, that Melchites, Maronites, Nestorians, Eutycheans, Jacobites, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spread these parts, maintaining their pestilent tenents with all obstinacy, which is that dead flesh which maketh the green wound of an errour fester by degrees into the old sore of an heresie. Then was it just with God to suffer them who would not be convinced with Christian Councels, to be subdued by the Pagans sword: For though Chosroes had not long a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled government in Palestine, but as a land-floud came and went away quickly; yet the Saracens who shortly followed, as stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water drowned all for a long continuance.<note place="margin">636.</note>

               <p>It may justly seem admirable how that senselesse religion should gain so much ground on Christianitie; especially having neither reall substance in her doctrine, nor winning behaviour in her ceremonies to allure professours. For what is it but the scumme of Judaisme and Paganisme sod together, and here and there strewed over with a spice of Christianitie? As Mahomets
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:21984:13"/>
tombe, so many sentences in his Alcoran seem to hang by some secret loadstone, which draweth together their gaping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependences with a mysticall coherence, or otherwise they are flat non-sense. Yet this wonder of the spreading of this leprosie is lessened, if we consider that besides the generall causes of the growing of all errours (namely the gangrene-like nature of evil, and the justice of God to deliver them over to beleeve lies who will not obey the truth) Mahometanisme hath raised it self to this height by some peculiar advantages: First, by permitting much carnall libertie to the professours (as having many wives) and no wonder if they get fish enough, that use that bait: Secondly, by promising a paradise of sensuall pleasure hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, wherewith flesh and bloud is more affected (as falling under her experience) then with hope of any spirituall delights: Thirdly, by prohibiting of disputes, and suppressing of all learning; and thus Mahomet made his shop dark on purpose, that he might vent any wares: Lastly, this religion had never made her own passage so fast and so farre, if the sword had not cut the way before her, as commonly the conquered follow for the most part the religion of the conquerours. By this means that cursed doctrine hath so improved it self, that it may outvie with professours the Church of Rome, which boasteth so much of her latitude and extent; though from thence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre that her faith is the best, is falsely to conclude the fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the cloth from the largenesse of the measure.</p>
               <p>Now the condition of the Christians under these Saracens was as uncertain as April-weather. Sometimes they enjoyed the libertie and publick exercise of their religion: and to give the Mahometans their due, they are generally good-fellows in this point, and Christians amongst them may keep their consciences free, if their tongues be fettered not to oppose the doctrine of Mahomet. Sometimes they were under fierce and cruel afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, their Bishops and Ministers forced to flie from their places were kept very poore, as alwayes the Clergie under persecution count the God gives them living enough, when he gives them their lives. Tyrius <note n="*" place="margin">

For a spitefull and malicious Saracen had secretly defiled one of their Mosques in Jerusalem; which deed being imputed to the poore Christians, they were all presently dragged to the place of execution to be put to death, when behold a young man, a zealous Christian, by an officious lie (the most lawfull of all unlawfull things) confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed himself alone to be guilty of the fact, and so being killed by exquisite torments, saved the lives of many innocents. In memorie of which act, the Christians in Jerusalem kept a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant solemnity, and once a yeare triumphantly marched with

               <p>IT happened there came a pilgrime to Jerusalem called Peter, an Hermite, born at Amiens in France; one of a contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble person: His silly looks carried in them a despair of any worth; and yet (as commonly the richest mines lie under the basest and barrenest surface of ground) he had a quick appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension, eloquent tongue, and what got him the greatest re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, was accounted very religious. With him Simon the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of Jerusalem often treated, concerning the present mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Christians under the Turks; what hope of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and how the matter might secretly be contrived, that the Princes in Europe might assist and relieve them. Peter mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the Patriarchs perswasions, the equitie and honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blenesse of the cause, and chiefly with a vision (as they say) from <note n="*" place="margin">

               <head>Chap. 9. Arguments for the lawfulnesse of the Holy warre.</head>
               <p>IT is stiffely canvased betwixt learned men, whether this warre was lawfull, or not. The reasons for the affirmative are fetcht either from piety or policie: And of the former sort are these.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. All the earth is Gods land let out to tenants; but Judea was properly his demesnes, which he kept long in his own hands for himself and his children. Now though the infidels had since violently usurped it, yet no prescription of time could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the title of the King of Heaven, but that now the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians might be Gods champions to recover his interest.</item>
                  <item>2. Religion bindeth men to relieve their brethren in distresse, especially when they implore their help, as now the <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Tyrius, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.</note> Christians in Syria did; whose intreaties in this case, sounded commands in the eares of such as were piously disposed.</item>
                  <item>3. The Turks by their blasphemies and reproches against God and our Saviour, had disinherited and devested themselves of all their right to their lands; and the Christians, as the next undoubted heirs, might seize on the forfeiture.</item>
                  <item>4. This warre would advance and increase the patrimony of Religion, by propagating the Gospel, and converting of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. If any object that Religion is not to be beaten into men with the dint of sword; yet it may be lawfull to open the way by force, for instruction, catechising, and such other gentle means to follow after.</item>
                  <item>5. The beholding of those sacred places in Palestine would much heighten the adventurers devotion, and make the most frozen heart to melt into pious meditations.</item>
                  <item>6. <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Bellarm. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>de Rom. Pont. cap.</hi> 17.</note>This enterprise was furthered by the perswasions of sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry godly men, S. Bernard, and others. Now though a lying spirit may delude the prophets of Achab, yet none will be so uncharitable as to think God would suffer his own Michaiah to be deceived.</item>
                  <item>7. <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Ibidem.</hi>
                     </note>God set his hand to this warre, and approved it by many miracles which he wrought in this expedition, and which are so confidently and generally reported by credit-worthy wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that he himself is a miracle that will not beleeve them.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Neither want there arguments derived from policie.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Palestine was a parcell of the Romane Empire, though since won by the Saracens: and though the Emperour of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople could not recover his right, yet did he alwayes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue his claim, and now (as <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Baronius, tom.</hi> 11. <hi>pag.</hi> 687.</note> appeared by his letters read in the Placentine Councel) Alexius requested these Princes of the West to assist him in the recovery thereof.</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:21984:16"/>2. A preventive warre grounded on a just fear of an invasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is lawfull: But such was this Holy warre. And because most stresse is laid on this argument, as the main supporter of the cause, we will examine and prove the parts thereof.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Though umbrages and light jealousies created by cowardly fansies be too narrow to build a fair quarrel on; yet the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of a preventive warre founded on just fear, is warranted by reason and the practice of all wise nations. In such a case it is folly to do as countrey-fellows in a fense-school, never ward a blow till it be past: but it is best to be before-hand with the enemie, lest the medicine come too late for the maladie. In such dangers to play an after-game, is rather a shift then a poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: especially seeing warre is a tragedy which alwayes destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the stage whereon it is acted; it is the most advised way, not to wait for the enemie, but to seek him out in his own countrey.</p>
               <p>Now that the Mahometans (under whom the Turks and Saracens are comprehended, differing in nation, agreeing in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and spite against Christians) were now justly to be fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, cannot be denied. So vast was the appetite of their sword, that it had alreadie devoured Asia, and now reserved Grecia for the second course. The Bosporus was too narrow a ditch, and the Empire of Grecia too low an hedge to fense the Pagans out of West-Christendome: yea, the Saracens had lately wasted <note n="*" place="margin">

The cafe therefore standing thus, this Holy warre was both lawfull and necessarie: which like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a sharp pike in the bosse of a buckler, though it had a mixture of offending, yet it was chiefly of a defensive nature, to which all preventive warres are justly reduced.</p>
               <p>Lastly, this warre would be the sewer of Christendome, and drain all discords out of it. For active men like mill-stones in motion, if they have no other grist to grind, will set fire one on another. Europe at this time surfeted with people, and many of them were of stirring natures, who counted themselves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, when they were out of doing; and therefore they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed themselves in mutuall jarres and contentions: But now this Holy warre would make up all breaches, and unite all their forces against the common foe of Christianitie.</p>

                  </note> many are of the contrary opinion, and count this warre both need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse and unlawfull, induced thereunto with these or the like arguments.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. When the Jews were no longer Gods people, Judea was no longer Gods land by any peculiar appropriation; but on the other side, God stamped on that countrey an indelible character of desolation, and so scorched it with his anger, that it will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver change colour, though Christians should wash it with their bloud. It is labour in vain therefore for any to endeavour to reestablish a flourishing kingdome in a blasted countrey: and let none ever look to reap any harvest, who sow that land which God will have to lie fallow.</item>
                  <item>2. Grant the Turks were no better then dogs, yet were they to be let alone in their own kennel. They and the Saracens their predecessours, had now enjoyed Palestine foure hundred and sixty yeares: Prescription long enough to sodder the most crackt title, and not onely to corroborate but to create a right. Yea, God himself may seem herein to allow their title, by suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them so long peaceably to enjoy it.</item>
                  <item>3. To visit those places in Jerusalem (the theatre of so many mysteries and miracles) was a uselesse as difficult; and might be superstitious if any went (as it is to be feared too many did) with placing transcendent holinesse in the place, and with a wooden devotion to the materiall Crosse.

                  <item>4. Lastly, this warre was a quicksand to swallow treasure, and of a hot digestion to devoure valiant men: no good, much evil came thereby; and the Christians that went out to seek an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie in Asia, brought one thence, to the danger of all Europe, and the losse of a fair part thereof. For though

               <head>Chap. 11. The private ends and profits of the Pope, which he is charged by authours to have had in this Holy warre.</head>
               <p>IT is enough with some to make it suspicious that there were some sinister ends in this warre, because Gregory the seventh, otherwise called Hildebrand (and by Luther, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>In his Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologie.</hi>

                  <hi>Larva diaboli</hi>) the worst of all that sat in that chair, first began it: but death preventing him, Urbane the second (whom Cardinall Benno called<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Balaeus, in Rom. Pont. in Urban.</hi> 2.</note> Turbane for troubling the whole world) effected it. And though the pretenses were pious and plausible, yet no doubt the thoughts of his Holinesse began where other mens ended, and he had a privie project beyond the publick designe;</p>
               <p>First, to reduce the<note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Matt. Dress. De bello sacr. cited by Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padius Melli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic. histor. part.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 266.</note> Grecians into subjection to himself with their three Patriarchs of Jerusalem, Antioch, and Constantino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to make the Eastern Church a Chapell of ease to the Mother-Church of Rome.</p>
               <p>Secondly, this warre was the Popes house of Correction, whither he sent his sturdie and stubborn enemies to be tamed. Such high-spirited men whom he either feared or suspected, he condemned to this employment, as to an honourable banish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and as Saul being afraid of David sent him to fight against the Philistines, that so he might fall by their sword; so the Pope
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:21984:17"/>
had this cleanly and unsuspected conveyance to <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See Daniel, in Henry the third, pag.</hi> 141.</note> rid away those he hated, by sending them against infidels. This appeared most plainly in the matter of the Emperour himself, whom he sent from home, that so he might rob his house in his absence. At the beginning of this warre, the Popes temporall power in Italy was very slender, because the Emperours dominions did gird him close and hard on all sides: but soon after he grew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in short time without all measure, and did lurch a castle here, gain a citie there from the Emperour, whiles he was imployed in Palestine: So that by the time that the Christians had lost all in Syria, the Emperour had lost all in Italy; his dominions there being either swallowed up by Peters patrimony, or by private Princes and upstart free-states, which as so many splinters flew out of the broken Empire.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, hereby the Pope determined on his side the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullest controversie that ever was in Christendome<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This was about the investiture of Bishops, whether the right lay in the Pope or in secular Princes. Now his Holinesse diverted this question out of Princes heads, by opening an issue an other way; and gave vent to the activitie of their spirits in this martiall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, and in the mean time quietly went away without any corrivall, concluding the controversie for his own profit.</p>
               <p>Lastly, he got a masse of money by it. He had the office to bear the bag, and what was put into it, as contributed to this action from pious people, and expended but some few drops of the showres he received. Guesse the rest of his griping tricks from this one which<note n="*" place="margin">

Diversis muscipulis simplicem Dei populum substantiâ suâ moliebatur Romana cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria privare, nihil petens nisi aurum &amp; argentum.</note> Matth. Paris reporteth. First, he prompt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many people in England unfit for arms, to take upon them a vow to go to the Holy warre, and this was done by the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and preaching of the Friars. This done, he compelled and forced those Votaries (whose purses were more usefull for this service then their persons) to commute their journey into money, the payment whereof should be as meritorious as their pilgrimage. And thus scraped he a masse of coin from such silly people as thought themselves cleansed of their sinnes when they were wiped of their money, and who having made themselves slaves to the Pope by their rash vow, were glad to buy their libertie at his price.</p>
               <p>As the Pope, so most of the Clergie improved their estates by this warre: for the secular Princes who went this voyage, sold or morgaged most of their means (selling for gold to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase with steel and iron) and the Clergy were generally their chapmen. For they advised these undertakers, seeing this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was for Christ and his Church, rather to make over their estates to spirituall men, of whom they might again redeem the same, and from whom they should be sure to find the fairest

the first, yet afterwards it proved the main Atlas of the warre: that nation like a heavie bell was long a raising, but being got up made a loud sound.</p>
               <p>Italy sent few out of her heart and middle provinces nigh Rome. The Pope was loth to adventure his darlings into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: those white-boyes were to stay at home with his Holinesse their tender father: Wherefore<note n="*" place="margin">

Peters patrimonie must as well be looked to, as Christs se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre. But though the Pope would spend none of his own fewel, he burnt the best stakes of the Emperours hedge, and furthered the Imperiall partie to consume it self in this tedious warre. Out of the furthermost parts of Italie, Boemund Prince of Tarentum, and Tancred his nephew (both of the Normane seed, though growing on the Apulian soyl) led an army of twelve thousand men. And Lombardy was also very liberall of her souldiers towards this expedition.</p>

                  </note>England (the Popes pack-horse in that age, which seldome rested in the stable when there was any work to be done) sent many brave men under Robert Duke of Normandy, brother to William Rufus; as Beauchamp, and others, whose names are lost.

               <p>Spain had other use for her swords against the Saracens at home, and therefore sent none of her men abroad. As <note n="*" place="margin">

Thus they acted the same part, though not on the same stage with our Pilgrimes, as being also imployed in fight against the infidels.</p>
               <p>Poland had the same excuse for not much appearing clean through this warre; because she lieth bordering on the Tartars in her appendant countrey of Lituania, and therefore was busied in making good her frontiers. Besides, no wonder if Prussia, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuania, and Livonia were not up in this service; for it was scarce break of day with them, and the sunne of the Gospel was new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (if at all) risen in those parts.

               <p>Hungary might bring filling-stones to this building, but few foundation or corner-stones, and at this time had no commander of note in this action.</p>
               <p>Scotland also presenteth us not with any remarkable piece of service which her men performed in all this warre. It was not want of devotion, which was hot enough in that cold countrey: rather we may impute it to want of shipping, that countrey be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

               <p>Denmark and Norway neare-acquainted with the Arctick pole, though they lagged the last, (and may therein be excused because of the length of the way) were sharers in the honour of this imployment, and performed good sea-service.</p>
               <p>Sweden either acted not at all, or else had a very short part in this businesse.

               <p>This was no pleasant prospect to Alexius the Grecian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, to see the sea full of ships, the shore of souldiers. He had gotten the Empire by bad practices (by deposing and cloistering Nicephorus his predecessour) and an ill conscience needeth no enemie but it self: for now he affrighteth himself with the fansie, that these Pilgrimes were so many pioners come to undermine him. Yea, he seemeth to have entailed his jealousies on all his successours; who never cordially affected this warre, but suspect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that these Western Christians made but a false blow at Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, and meant to hit Constantinople. But though he had a storm in his heart, yet he made all fair weather in his face; and finding these his guests so strong that they could command their own welcome, he entertained them rather for fear then love. At last it was <note n="*" place="margin">

               <head>Chap. 16. The estate of Asia; siege, and taking of Nice; Turks overthrown in battel.</head>
               <p>AT our last mentioning of the Turks and their victories, we left them possest of Jerusalem, and the greater part of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria: but since they have thrived better, and won the lesser Asia from the Grecian Emperour. Indeed those Emperours with their own hands lifted up the Turks into their throne, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed them thus speedily to conquer. For giving themselves over to pleasure, they gave little countenance, and lesse maintenance to men of service and action: whereby the martiall sparks in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble spirits were quenched; and no wonder if vertue did wither where it was not watered with reward. Secondly, out of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetousnesse the Emperours unfurnished their frontiers of garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and laid them open to invasions; a notorious solecisme in policie: for if doores in private houses are to be locked, much more frontiers in kingdomes. Neither did it a little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage the Turks proceedings, that the Grecian Empire fell to
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:21984:21"/>
Eudoxia a woman, and her children in minoritie, too weak pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots to steer so great a State in the tempest of warre. And though after other changes it fell to Alexius, one whose perso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall abilities were not to be excepted against; yet he being to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally busied at home, to maintain his title against home-bred foes, had no leisure to make any effectuall resistance against for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein enemies. Nor did the death of Cutlen-Muses their king any whit prejudice the Turkish proceedings: for Solyman his sonne succeeded him, a Prince no lesse famous for his clemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie then his conquests; as victory to generous minds is onely an inducement to moderation. In this case under the tyrannie of the Turks stood Asia the lesse; and though there were many Christians in every citie, yet these being disarmed, had no other weapons then those of the Primitive Church, tears and prayers.</p>
               <p>But now these Western Pilgrimes arriving there,<note place="margin">1097</note> besiege the citie of Nice with an armie as glorious as ever the sunne be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>May</hi> 14.</note> This citie was equally beholden to nature and art for her strength; and was formerly famous for the first generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel, called there by Constantine against Arius, wherein were assembled 318 Bishops. The Pilgrimes had a Lombard for their engineer; the neighbouring wood afforded them materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, whereof they made many warlike instruments, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped speedily to conquer the citie. But breathed deer are not so quickly caught. The Turks within being experienced soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, defeated their enterprises. And here one might have seen art promising her self the victory, and suddenly meeting with counter-art which mastered her. The lake Ascanius whereon the citie stood, having an out-let into the sea, much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantaged the besieged, whereby they fetcht victualls from the countrey, till at last that passage was locked up by the Grecian fleet. Soon after the citie was surrendred,<note place="margin">

Solymans wife and young children were taken prisoners, and the citie (according to the agreement) was delivered to Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus the Grecian Admirall in behalf of Alexius his master.</p>
               <p>From hence the Christians set forward to the vale of Dogor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, when behold Solyman with all his might fell upon them, and there followed a cruel battel, fought with much courage and varietie of successe. A cloud of arrows darkened the skie, which was quickly dissolved into a showre a bloud. The Christians had many disadvantages: For their enemies were three to one; and valour it self may be pressed to death under the weight of multitude. The season was unseasonable; the scorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the sunne much annoying these northern people, whilest
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:21984:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the Turks had bodies of proof against the heat. Besides, the Christians horses affrighted with the barbarous sounds of the Turkish drummes, were altogether unserviceable. However, they bravely maintained their fight by the speciall valour and wisdome of their leaders (amongst whom Boemund, and Hugh brother to the King of France, deserved high commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations) till at last finding themselves overmatched, they began to guard their heads with their heels, and fairly ran away.

Two thousand on their side were slain, whereof William the brother of Tancred, Godfrey de Mont, and Robert of Paris were of speciall note.

Hereupon it was bestowed on Boemund; though this place dearly purchased was not long quietly possessed: For Corboran the Turkish Generall came with a vast armie of Persian forces, and besieged the Christians in the citie, so that they were brought into a great strait betwixt death and death, hunger within and their foes without. Many secretly stole away, whereat the rest were no whit discomfited, counting the losse of cowards to be gain to an armie. At last, they generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved rather to lose their lives by whole-sale on the point of the sword, then to retail them out by famine, which is the worst of tyrants, and murdereth men in state, whilest they die in not dying.

               <p>The pride of the Turks being abated in this battel, and an 100000 of them being slain, the Christians grew mightily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent, and forgot to return to God the honour of the victorie. Whereupon followed a great mortalitie, and 50000 died in few dayes; whether this proceeded from the climate (the bodies of Europe not being friends with the aire of Asia, til use by degrees reconcileth them) or whether it was caused by their intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance: for after long fasting they would not measure their sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macks by the standard of physick<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and dieting themselves till nature by degrees could digest the meat; but by surfeting dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged their graves with their own teeth.</p>
               <p>And now we are come to the skirts and borders of Palestine. Wherefore as Heralds use to blazon the field before they med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the charge, so let us describe the land before we relate the actions done therein.

               <head>Chap. 19. Galilee described.</head>
               <p>PAlestine contained foure provinces: Galilee on the north, Trachonitis beyond Jordan on the east, Judea on the south, and Samaria in the middle. Galilee was divided into the upper and lower. The upper (called also Galilee of the Gentiles, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it bordered on them) comprehended the tribes of Asher and Nephthali.</p>
               <p>Asher entertaineth us with these observables: 1. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Iosh.</hi> 11.8.</note> Misrephoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>majim, the Nantwich of Palestine, where salt was boyled. 2. Sarepta, where Elijah multiplied the widows oyl. 3. Tyre, anciently the Royall-Exchange of the world; but of this (as of Sidon and Ptolemais) largely hereafter. 4. Aphek, whose walls falling down gave both the death and grave-stones to 27000 of Benhadads souldiers. 5. Cana the great, whereof was that wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whose daughter Christ dispossessed of a devil. 6. Belus, a rivulet famous for his glassie sand. 7. Mount Libanus, whether so called (as our Albion) from his snowy top, or from frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense growing thereon.</p>
               <p>Nephthali, with these: 1. Abel-beth-maacha: In this bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough Sheba that vermine earthed himself, till a womans wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome threw his head over the wals: And pitie it was those wals should have stood, if they had been too high to throw a tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours head over them. 2. Harosheth, the citie of Sisera, who for all his commanding of 900 iron-chariots, was slain with one iron-nail. 3. Capernaum, where Christ healed the Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rions servant; and not farre off fed an army of guests with five loaves and two fishes: so that if we consider what they ate, we may wonder that they left any thing; if what they left, that they ate any thing. 4. Kedesh, a citie of refuge, whither they were to flie that killed men unawares. As for those who formerly privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged Sanctuaries in England, where the worst traytours and wilfullest murderers were secure from punishment, they rather propounded Romulus then Moses for their president. 5. Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blah, where King Zedekiah (more unhappy that he saw so long then that he was blind so soon) had his eyes put out, after he had beheld the slaughter of his sonnes. 6. Cesarea-Philippi, the chief citie of Decapolis; which was a small territorie on both
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:21984:24"/>
sides of Jordan, so called of ten cities it contained; though Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours wonderfully differ in reckoning them up. 7. Christs mount, so named because it was his pulpit, as the whole Law was his text, when he made that famous sermon in the mount. This Sunne of righteousnesse, which had all Palestine for his zodiack, the twelve tribes for his signes, stayed longest here and in Zabulon; and as S. Hierome <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Lower Galilee consisted of Zabulon and Issachar. Zabulon presenteth us with Naim, where our Saviour raised the widows sonne, so that she was twice a mother, yet had but one child. 2. Cana the lesse, where he shewed the virginitie of his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles at a marriage, turning water into wine. 3. Bethulia, where Judeth strook off Holofernes his head; though some since have strook off that story, not onely from canonicall scripture, but from truth. 4. Bethsaida, upbraided by Christ, famous for her great means, great ingratitude, great punishment. 5. Nazareth, where our Saviour had his conception and education. 6. Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berias, so called by Herod the Tetrarch in the honour of Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius. 7. Mount Carmel, the Jewish Parnassus, where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were so conversant. 8. Tabor, where our Saviour was transfigured, the earnest of his future glory. 9. The river Ki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shon, Gods besome to sweep away Sisera's great armie.</p>
               <p>In Issachar we find Tarichea, taken with great difficultie by Vespasian. 2. Shunem, where Elisha was so often entertained by an honourable woman. And as if this land had been thirsty of bloud, here in this tribe were fought the battels of Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deon against the Midianites, Jehu against Jehoram, Saul against the Philistines upon mount Gilboa. David therefore cursed that mountain that neither dew nor rain should fall on it. But of late some English travellers climbing this mountain were well wetted, David not cursing it by a propheticall spirit, but in a poeticall rapture.</p>

3.

Megiddo, where Josiah that bright sunne set in a cloud, engaging himself in a needlesse quarrel, wherein he was slain. 5. Cesarea-Stratonis, where Herod was eaten up with worms. 6. Jezreel, a royall citie of the Kings of Israel, nigh which lay the vineyard or rather bloud-yard of Naboth.</p>
               <p>Ephraim was adorned with Samaria the chief citie of Israel, which at this day sheweth more ruines then Jerusalem. 2. Shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loh, where the Ark was long leiger; and where Eli heart-bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with bad news, brake his neck with a fall. 3. Sichem, where Dinah bought the satisfying of her curiositie with the losse of her chastitie. And as if the ground here were stained with perfidiousnesse, here Simeon and Levi killed the Siche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites, Joseph was sold by his brethren, Abimelech usurped the government, the ten tribes revolted from Rehoboam. 4. Mount Ephraim, a ridge of hills crossing this countrey. 5. Gerizzim and Ebal, two mountains: the blessings were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced on the one, and the curses on the other.</p>

They hitherto had been fellow-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners with the Angels, feeding on manna, which here ceased; God withdrawing miracles where he afforded means. 2.

Here Joshua sent his mandate to the sunne to stand still, and to wait on him whilest he conquered his enemies. 3. Nob, where Doeg, more cruel then the Kings cattel he kept, slew eighty five Priests as inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent as their ephods were white. 4. Jericho, whose walls were battered down with the sound of rammes horns. 5. Bethel, where God appeared to Jacob. 6. Ai, where the Israelites were slain for the sacriledge of Achan.</p>
               <p>Dan had these memorables. 1. Joppa a safe harbour, where Jonah fled from Gods service. 2. Ashdod or Azotus, where Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon did twice homage to the Ark, not onely falling bare, but put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:21984:25"/>
off his head and hands. 3. Gath, a seminary of giants, where Goliath was born. 4. Ekron, where Beelzebub the God of flies had a nest or temple. 5. Timnath, where Judah committed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cest with Tamar, but betrayed himself by his own tokens, and beat himself with his own staff. Hence Samson fetcht his wife, whose <hi>epithalamium</hi> proved the dirge to so many Philistines. 6. Modin, where the Maccabees were buried. 7. Sorek, the chief if not onely rivulet of this tribe.</p>
               <p>Entring on the south-coasts of Simeon, we light on Askelon, where Herod was born. 2. Gaza, chief of the five Satrapies of the Philistines, the gates whereof Samson carried away; and hither being sent for to make sport in the house of Dagon, acted such a tragedie that plucked down the stage, slew himself and all the spectatours. 3. More inland; Ziklag, assigned by Achish to David. 4. Beersheba and Gerar, where Abraham and Isaac lived most constantly, neare unto the brook of Besor.</p>
               <p>The tribe of Judah was the greatest of all, so that Simeon and Dan did feed on the reversion thereof, and received those ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which originally belonged to this royall tribe. Memorable herein were 1. Hebron, the land whereof was given to Caleb, because he and Joshua consented not to the false verdict which the jurie of spies brought in against the land of Canaan. 2. Nigh, in the cave of Machpelah, the Patriarchs were buried; whose bodies took livery and seasin in behalf of their posteritie, which were to possesse the whole land. 3. Kirjath-sepher or Debir, an ancient Universitie of the Canaanites: for though Parnassus was onely in Greece, yet the Muses were not confined to that countrey. 4. Tekoa, where Amos was born, fetcht from the herdsmen, to feed Gods sheep; and to dresse his vine, from gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wild-figs. 5. Zoar, Lots refuge; neare to which his wife for one farewell-glance at Sodome, was turned into a pillar of salt, to season us to measure a sinne by the infinitenesse of God who forbiddeth it. Adjoyning is Lots cave; where he affecting solitarinesse, had too much company of his own daughters. 6. Carmel, where Nabal lived as rich as foolish; but those grains of wisdome which were wanting in him, were found over-weight in his wife. Here Uzziah pastured his cattel, a King, yet delighted in husbandry; as thrift is the fewel of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificence. 7. Bethlehem, where our Saviour was born. 8.

The river Arnon parteth this tribe from Moab.</p>
               <p>In Gad, we find Peniel where Jacob wrestled with God; lost a sinew, but got a blessing: Jabesh-gilead, where Saul was bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried: Ramoth-gilead, where Ahab was slain: Rogelim, the mannour of Barzillai, superannuated to be a courtier: Maha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naim, where the Angels appeared to Jacob: The forrest of Ephraim, where that execution was done by Jephthah on the Ephraimites, for not pronouncing that heavie aspiration in Shib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boleth: The river Jabbok.</p>

                  <hi>Man shall carry nothing away with him, neither shall his great pomp follow him.</hi> Thirdly, Aceldama that burying-place for strangers: and the grave that every where hath a good stomack, hath here a <hi>boulimia</hi> or greedy worm; for it will devoure the flesh of a corpse in 48 houres. Fourthly, Absaloms pillar, which he built to continue his memorie, though he might have saved that cost, having eternized his infamy by his unnaturall rebellion. Fifth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the houses of Annas and Caiaphas, to passe by others of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour note.</p>
               <p>On the east; First, mount Olivet, from whence our Saviour
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:21984:27"/>
took his rise into heaven. The chapell of Ascension, of an eight-square round mounted on three degrees, still challengeth great reverence; and there the footsteps of our Saviour are still to be seen, which cannot be covered over. Secondly, the fig-tree which Christ cursed: for he who spake many, here wrought a parable; this whole tree being but the bark, and Christ under it cursing the fruitlesse profession of the Jews. Thirdly, the place where S. Stephen was stoned; and the stones thereabouts are over-grown with a red rust, which is (forsooth) the very bloud of that holy martyr. Fourthly, the place where Judas surprised our Saviour, and he fell down on a stone, in which the print of his elbows and feet are still to be seen. Fifthly, the sepulchre of the blessed Virgin: whose body after it had been three dayes bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, was carried up by the Angels into heaven; and she let fall her <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sandys, pag.</hi> 190.</note> girdle to S. Thomas, that his weak faith might be swad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled therewith: otherwise he who in the point of Christs resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection would have no creed, except he made his own articles, and put his finger into his side, would no doubt hardly have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved the Virgins assumption. With this legend we may cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple another, which though distant in place will be beleeved both together: They shew at <note n="*" place="margin">

But who will not conclude but there was a <hi>vertigo</hi> in his head, who first made a starre subject to the falling-sicknesse? Sixthly, the vale of Hinnom or Tophet, in which wise Solomon befooled by his wives, built a temple to Moloch. Seventhly, Cedron, a brook so often mentioned in Scripture.</p>
               <p>The west and north-sides of Jerusalem were not so happily planted with sacred monuments; and we find none thereon which grew to any eminencie.</p>
               <p>We will now lead the Reader into Jerusalem: Where first on mount Moriah (the place where Isaac was offered, though not sacrificed) stood Solomons temple, destroyed by the Chalde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, rebuilt by Zorobabel: Afterward Herod reedified it so stately (saith Josephus) that it exceeded Solomons temple; if his words exceed not the truth. But no wonder if he that never saw the sunne, dare say that the moon is the most glorious light in the heavens. Secondly, Solomons palace, which was <note n="*" place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 7.1.</note>thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen yeares in building, whereas the temple was finished in <note n="*" place="margin">1. <hi>King.</hi> 6.38.</note>seven: Not that he bestowed more cost and pains (because more time) on his own then on Gods house: but rather he <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> plied Gods work more throughly, and entertained then more build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; so that contrary to the proverb, Church-work went on the most speedily. Thirdly, the house of the forrest of Lebanon, which was (as appeareth by comparing the text) fourtie cubits
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:21984:27"/>
longer, and thirtie cubits broader then the temple it self. But no doubt the holy Spirit speaking of holy buildings, meaneth the great cubit of the Sanctuary; but in other houses, the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary or common cubit. It was called the house Lebanon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause hard by it Solomon planted a <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Adricom. ex Hieron. pag.</hi> 153.</note> grove, the abridgement of the great forrest; so that the pleasures of spacious Lebanon were here written in a lesse character. Fourthly, Pilates palace, and the Common hall, where the Judge of the world was condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death. Fifthly, the pool of Bethesda, the waters where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of troubled by the Angel were a <hi>Panpharmacon</hi> to him that first got into them. Here was a spittle built with five porches, the mercy of God being seconded by the charitie of man; God gave the cure, men built the harbour for impotent persons. Sixthly, the house of Dives the rich glutton: and therefore (saith <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Theatr. Terr. sanct.</hi> 153.</note> Adricomius) it was no parable: But may we not retort his words? It was a parable; and therefore this is none of Dives his house. Sure I am, Theophylact is against the literall sense thereof, and saith, They think <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>But my discourse hasteth to mount Calvarie; which at this day hath almost ingrossed all reverence to it self. It is called Calvarie, Golgotha, or the place of a scull, either because the hill is rolled and <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Illyricus, in</hi> 27. <hi>Matth.</hi>
                  </note> rounded up in the fashion of a mans head, (as <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> 
                  <hi>Pen</hi> in the British tongue signifieth both an head, and a copped hill) or because here the bodies of such as were executed were cast. As for the conceit, that Adams scull should here be found, it is confuted by S. Hierome, who will have him buried at He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bron. Neither is it likely, if the Jews had a tradition that the father of mankind had here been interted, that they would have made his sepulchre their Tiburn where malefactours were put to death, and the charnel-house where their bones were scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. Over our Saviours grave stood a stately church, built say some by Helen, say others by Constantine: but we will not set mother and sonne at variance; it might be she built it at his cost. In this church are many monuments: As the pillar where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Christ was bound when scourged; wherein red spots of dusky-veined marble <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bridenb. De Domin. sepulcre.</hi>
                  </note> usurped the honour to be counted Christs bloud. Secondly, a great cleft in the rock which was rent in sunder at the Passion, whereby the bad thief was divided from Christ (the signe of his spirituall separation) and they say it reacheth to the centre of the earth: a thing hard to confute. Thirdly, certain pillars which being in a dark place under ground, are said miraculously to weep for our Saviours suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. But I referre those who desire the criticismes of these pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces without going thither, to read our English travellers: for in this case as good wares and farre cheaper peny-worths are bought at the second hand.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="38" facs="tcp:21984:28"/>To conclude our description of Palestine, let none conceive that God forgot the Levites in division of the land, because they had no entire countrey allotted unto them. Their portion was as large as any, though paid in severall summes: They had 48 cities with their suburbs, tithes, first-fruits, free-offerings; being better provided for then many English ministers, who may preach of hospitalitie to their people, but cannot go to the cost to practice their own doctrine.</p>

As for the brook Cedron, it was dried up, as having no subsistence of it self, but merely depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the benevolence of winter-waters, which mount Olivet bestoweth upon it.

As for the Christians want of ladders, that was quickly sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: for the Genoans arriving with a fleet in Palestine, brought most curious engineers, who framed a wooden towre, and all other artificiall instruments.

perchance King <note n="*" place="margin">2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.15.</note> Uzziah first made it; for we find him very dextrous and happy in devising such things. And although these bear-whelps were but rude and unshaped at the first, yet art did lick them afterwards, and they got more teeth and sharper nails by degrees; so that every age set them forth in a new edition, corrected and amended. But these and many more voluminous engines (for the ramme alone had an hundred men to manage it) are now virtually epitomized in the cannon. And though some may say, that the finding of gunnes hath been the losing of many mens lives, yet it will appear that battels now are fought with more expedition, and victory standeth not so long a neuter, before she expresse her self on one side or other.</p>

               <p>When the first light brought news of a morning, they on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh; the rather, because they had <note n="*" place="margin">

The Turks retired to Solomons temple (so called
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:21984:29"/>
because built in the same place) there to take the farewell of their lives. In a desperate conflict there, the foremost of the Christians were miserably slain, thrust upon the weapons of their enemies by their fellows that followed them. The pave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment so swam, that none could go but either through a rivulet of bloud, or over a bridge of dead bodies. Valour was not wanting in the Turks, but superlatively abundant in the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, till night made them leave off. Next morning mercie was proclaimed to all those that would lay down their wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons: For though bloud be the best sauce for victorie, yet must it not be more then the meat. Thus was Jerusalem wonne by the Christians, and <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>M. Paris, pag.</hi> 65.</note>twentie thousand Turks therein slain, on the fifteenth of July being Friday, about three of the clock in the afternoon. <note n="*" place="margin">

But these Synchronismes, as when they are naturall they are pretty and pleasing; so when violently wrested, nothing more poore and ridiculous.</p>
               <p>Then many Christians, who all this while had lived in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem in most lamentable slaverie, being glad to lurk in secret (as truth oftentimes seeketh corners as fearing her judge, though never as suspecting her cause) came forth joyfully, wellcomed and embraced these the procurers of their liberty.</p>

The pretense was for fear of treason in them, if the Emperour of Persia should besiege the citie. And some slew them with the same zeal wherewith Saul slew the Gibeonites; and thought it unfit that these goats should live in the sheeps pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sture. But noble Tancred was highly displeased hereat, because done in cold bloud, it being no slip of an extemporany passion, but a studied and premeditated act; and that against pardon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, many of them having compounded and paid for their lives and libertie. Besides, the execution was mercilesse, upon sucking children, whose not-speaking spake for them; and on women, whose weaknesse is a shield to defend them against a valiant man. To conclude; Severitie hot in the fourth degree, is little better then poyson, and becometh crueltie it self: and this act seemeth to be of the same nature.</p>

               <p>They go on to a second choice; and that they may know the natures of the Princes the better, their servants were examined on oath to confesse their masters faults. The <note n="*" place="margin">

All admired hereat, that this mans worst vice should be so great a vertue, and unanimously chose him their King. He accepted the place, but refused the solemnity thereof; and would not wear a crown of gold there, where the Saviour of mankind had worn a crown of thorns.</p>
               <p>He was sonne to Bustace Duke of Bouillon, and Ida his wife, daughter and heir to Godfrey Duke of Lorein; born, saith <note n="*" place="margin">

Whilest he lived there, there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened an intricate suit betwixt him and another Prince about title of land; and because Judges could not untie the knot, it was concluded the two Princes should cut it asunder with their sword in a combat. Godfrey was very <note n="*" place="margin">Quantum potuit renite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur, <hi>Tyrius, lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 7.</note> unwilling to fight, not that he was the worse souldier, but the better Christian: he made the demurre not in his courage, but in his conscience; as conceiving any private title for land not ground enough for a duell: Yea, we may observe generally, that they who long most to fight duells, are the first that surfet of them. Notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he yeelded to the tyranny of custome, and after the fashion of the countrey entred the lists: when at the first encounter his sword brake; but he struck his adversary down with the hilt, yet so that he saved his life, and gained his own inheritance. Another parallel act of his valour was when being standard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearer to the Emperour, he with the imperiall ensigne killed Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulphus the Duke of Saxony in single fight, and fed the Eagle on the bowels of that arch-rebell. His soul was enriched with many vertues, but the most orient of all was his humility, which took all mens affections without resistance: And though one saith, Take away ambition, and you take away the spurres of a souldier; yet, Godfrey without those spurres rode on most tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphantly.</p>

               <p>BUt now let us leave the Helmets, and look on the Mitres, and consider the ordering of Ecclesiasticall affairs. For the Common-wealth is a Ring, the Church the Diamond; both well set together, receive, and return lustre each on other. As soon as Antioch was taken, one Bernard (a reverend Prelate) was made Patriarch there with generall consent. But more stirre was there about that place in Jerusalem: For first Arnulphus, a worthlesse and vitious man, was by <note n="*" place="margin">Fatuo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo suffragia inconsulta ministrante, <hi>Tyrius, lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> popular faction lifted up into the Patriarchs chair; but with much ado was avoided, and Dabert, Archbishop of Pisa, substituted in his room: one very wise and politick, an excellent book-man in reading of men, and otherwise well studied, especially as that age went, wherein a mediocrity was an eminency in learning. But he was infected with the humour of the clergie of that age, who counted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to want room except they justled with Princes. As for Arnulphus, he never ceased to trouble and molest this Dabert; and as a firebrand smoketh most when out of the chimney, so he after his displacing was most turbulent and unquiet, ever sitting on his skirts that sat in the Patriarchs chair, till after many chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges he struggled himself again into the place.</p>
               <p>Under these Patriarchs many Archbishops and Bishops were appointed in the very places (as neare as might be) where they were before the Saracens overrunning the countrey, and good maintenance assigned to most of them.</p>
               <p>But at this time Bishops were set too thick for all to grow great; and Palestine fed too many Cathedrall churches to have them generally fat. <note n="*" place="margin">

Surely, many of these Bishops (to use Bishop <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>In the Archbishops of Cant. p.</hi> 143.</note> Langhams expression) had high racks but poore mangers. Neither let it stagger the reader if in that catalogue of Tyrius he light on many Bishops seats which are not to be found in Mercator, Ortelius, or any other Geographer; for some of them

               <head>Chap. 5. The scuffling betwixt the King and Patriarch about the city of Ierusalem; the issue thereof.</head>
               <p>NOt long after, there was started a controversie of great consequence betwixt the King and Patriarch: the Patriarch claiming the cities of Jerusalem and Joppa, with the apperte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances; the King refusing to surrender them.</p>
               <p>The Patriarch pleaded, That these places anciently belonged to his predecessours: He set before the King the hainousnesse of sacriledge; how great a sinne it was when Princes, who should be nursing-fathers and suckle the Church, shall suck from it: and shewed how the Common-wealth may grow fat, but never healthfull, by feeding on the Churches goods.</p>
               <p>On the other side the King alledged, That the Christian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces had now purchased Jerusalem with their bloud, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed it on him: that the Patriarchs overgrown title was drowned in this late conquest; from which, as from a new foundation, all must build their claims who challenge any right to any part in the city. Secondly, he pleaded, it was unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that the King of Jerusalem should have nothing in Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem (as at this day the Romane Emperour is a very ciphre, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out power or profit in Rome) and should live rather as a sojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then a Prince in his royall citie, confined to an airy title, whilest the Patriarch should have all the command.</p>
               <p>To this the Patriarch answered, That the Christians new conquest could not cancell his ancient right, which was enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed even under the Saracens; That this voyage was principally undertaken for advancing the Church, and not to restore her onely to her liberty, and withhold from her her lands, so that in this respect she should find better usage from her foes then from her children. If we mistake not, the chief pinch of the cause lieth on the Patriarchs proof, that the lands he demanded formerly belonged to his predecessours: and we find him to fail in the main issue of the matter. True it was, that for the last thirty yeares the Patriarchs on condition they should repair and fortifie the walls of Jerusalem, were possessed of a fourth part of the city, even by grant from Bomensor the Emperour of the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:21984:34"/>
Saracens, in the yeare of our Lord 1063. But that ever he had the whole citie, either by this or by any previous grant, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth not in Tyrius; who saith moreover, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lib.</hi> 9. <hi>cap.</hi> 16.</note> We wonder for what reason the lord Patriarch should raise this controversie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Duke Godfrey.</p>
               <p>Let me adde, that this our Authour is above exception: for being both a politick states-man and pious prelate, no doubt his penne strikes the true and even stroke betwixt King and Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch. Besides, he might well see the truth of this matter, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a well-proportioned distance of time from it. Those who live too neare the stories they write, oftentimes willingly mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take through partiality; and those who live too farre off, are mistaken by uncertainties, the footsteps of truth being almost worn out with time.</p>
               <p>But to return to Godfrey, who though unwilling at first, yet afterwards not onely on Candlemasse-day restored to the Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch the fourth part of the citie, but also on the Easter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gave him all Jerusalem, Joppa, and whatsoever he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: conditionally that the King should hold it of the Patriarch till such time as he could conquer Babylon, or some other roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all citie fit for him to keep his court in. If in the mean time Godfrey died without issue, the Patriarch was to have it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently delivered unto him.</p>
               <p>We will be more charitable then those that say that the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch herein did <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> bewitch and be mad Godfrey to make this large donation to him, by torturing his conscience at the confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his sinnes. Onely we may question the discretion of this Prince in giving a gift of so large a size: for Charities eyes must be open as well as her hands; though she giveth away her branches, not to part with the root.</p>
               <p>And let the reader observe, that Godfrey at the time of this his bountifull grant lay on his death-bed, sick of that irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable disease which ended him. How easily may importunity stamp any impression on those whom desperate sicknesse hath softened! And if the sturdiest man nigh death may be affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into good works for fear of Purgatory, no wonder if devout Godfrey were pliable to any demand.<note n="*" place="margin">

As for that religious scruple which Godfrey made, to wear a crown of gold where Christ wore one of thorns, Baldwine easily dispensed therewith. And surely in these things the mind is all: A crown might be refused with pride, and worn with humility.</p>
               <p>But before his Coronation there was a tough bickering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the city of Jerusalem. Dabert the Patriarch, on the death of Godfrey, devoured Jerusalem and the towre of David in his hope; but coming to take possession, found the place too hot for him. For Garnier Earl of Gretz, in the behalf of King Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine (who was not as yet returned from Edessa) manned it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. But so it happened, that this valiant Earl died three dayes after, which by <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Tyrius, lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 4.</note> Dabert was counted a just judgement of God upon him for his sacriledge. Now though it be piety to impute all events to Gods hand, yet to say that this mans death was for such a sinne, sheweth too much presumption towards God, and too little charity towards our neighbour. Indeed if sudden death had singled out this Earl alone, it had somewhat favoured their censure; but there was then a generall mortality in the city which swept away <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vrsperg. pag.</hi> 236.</note> thousands: and, which is most materiall, what this Patriarch interpreted sacriledge, others accounted loyalty to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne. As for that donation of the city of Jerusalem and towre of David which Godfrey gave to the Patriarch, some thought that this gift overthrew it self with its own greatnesse, being so immoderately large: others supposed it was but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall act of Godfrey, and therefore died with the giver; as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving his successours not obliged to perform it, because it was unreasonable that a Prince should in such sort fetter and restrain those which should come after him. Sure it is, that Baldwine having both the stronger sword, and possession of the

He hearing that he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of to the Pope for his irregular election, posted to Rome to excuse himself, shewing he was chosen against his will: and though preferment may not be snatched, it needs not be thrust away. But all would not do; It was enough to put him out, because the King put him in.

                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:21984:36"/>Gibellinus coming to Jerusalem, concluded the election of Ebremarus to be illegall and void, and was himself chosen Patriarch in his place; and the other in reverence of his piety made Archbishop of Cesarea.<note place="margin">1108.</note> And though Arnulphus (the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brand of this Church) desired the Patriarchs place for himself, yet was he better content with Gibellinus his election, because he was a through-old man, and hoped that candle would quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go out that was in the socket.</p>

                     <hi>Baronius in anno</hi> 1108.</note> But Bernard Patriarch of Antioch found himself much aggrieved hereat; because many of these cities by the ancient ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Councel of Nice, were subject to his Church. At last the Pope took the matter into his hand, and stroked the angry Patriarch of Antioch into gentlenesse with good language. He shewed, how since the Councel of Nice the countrey had got a new face; ancient mountains were buried, rivers drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in oblivion, and they new-christened with other names: Yea, the deluge of the Saracens tyranny had washed away the bounds of the Churches jurisdictions, that now they knew not their own severals, where Mahometanisme so long had made all common and waste. He desired him therefore to be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with this new division of their jurisdictions: especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was reasonable, that the King of Jerusalem and his successours should dispose of those places which they should winne with their own swords. Bernard perceiving hereby how his Holinesse stood affected in the businesse, contented his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that he had set his title on foot, and then quietly let it fall to the ground, as counting it no policie to shew his teeth where he durst not bite.</p>
               <p>Gibellinus never laid claim to the citie of Jerusalem, whether it was because in thankfulnesse for this large ecclesiasticall power which King Baldwine had bestowed upon him, or that his old age was too weak to strive with so strong an adversarie. He sat foure yeares in his chair, and Arnulphus thinking he went too slow to the grave, is suspected to have given him something to have mended his pace, and was himself substituted in his room by the especiall favour of King Baldwine.</p>
               <p>This Arnulphus was called <hi>mala corona,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1112.</note> as if all vices met in him to dance a round. And no wonder if the King being himself wantonly disposed, advanced such a man: for generally, loose Patrones cannot abide to be pinched and pent with over-strict Chaplains. Besides, it was policie in him to choose such a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch as was liable to exceptions for his vitious life; that so if he began to bark against the King, his mouth might be quickly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:21984:36"/>
stopped. Arnulphus was as quiet as a lambe, and durst never challenge his interest in Jerusalem from Godfreys donation; as fearing to wrestle with the King, who had him on the hip, and could out him at pleasure for his bad manners. Amongst other vices he was a great church-robber, who to make Emmelor his niece a Princesse, and to marry Eustace Prince of Sidon, gave her the citie of Jericho for her dowrie, and lands belonging to his See worth five thousand crowns yearly. And though Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists may pretend that marriage causeth covetousnesse in the Clergie, yet we shall find when the Prelacie were constrained to a single life, that their nephews ate more church-bread then now the children of married Ministers. Yea, some Popes not onely fed their bastards with church-milk, but even cut off the churches breasts for their pompous and magnificent mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. And thus having dispatched the story of the Church in this Kings reigne, we come now to handle the businesse of the Common-wealth entirely by it self.</p>

The army that came out of Lombardy were so eaten up by the swords of the Turks, that no fragments of them were left, nor news to be heard what was become of them: And no wonder, being led by Prelates unexperienced in martiall affairs; which, though perchance great Clerks, were now to turn over a new leaf, which they had no skill to reade. <note n="*" place="margin">

Whereupon, as these Pilgrimes went through his countrey, he did them all possible mischief, still under the pretense of kindnesse, (What hinderer to a false helper?) calling the chief Captains of the army his sonnes; but they found it true, The more courtesie, the more craft.

               <p>MEan time King Baldwine was imployed with better suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse in Palestine: for hitherto Joppa was the onely port the Christians had; but now by the assistance of the Genoan fleet (who for their pains were to have <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>But see the chance of warre; Few dayes after at the same place he received a great defeat by the Infidels, wherein besides many others, the two Stephens, Earls of Burgundy and Bloys, were slain. This was the first great overthrow the Christians suffered in Palestine: and needs must blows be grievous to them who were not used to be beaten. The King was reported slain, but fame deserved to be pardoned for so good a lie; which for the present much disheartened the Christians, a great part of the souldiers courage being wrapped up in the life of the Generall.</p>

This his victory followed so suddenly after his overthrow, that some mention not the overthrow at all, but the victory onely; as that good horseman is scarce perceived to be thrown, that quickly recovereth the saddle.</p>

               <p>Fleshed with this conquest, they next besieged Tyre. Sea and land, nature and art consented together to make this city strong: for it was seated in an island, save that it was tacked to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent with a small neck of land, which was fortified with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny walls and towres. It is questionable whether the strength or wealth of this city was greater; but out of question that the pride was greater then either. Here the best purples were died, a colour even from the beginning destined to Courts and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracie; and here the richest clothes were imbroidered and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously wrought. And though generally those who are best with their fingers are worst with their arms, yet the Tyrians were also stout men, able mariners, and the planters of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blest colonies in the world. As their city was the daughter of Zidon, so was it mother to Romes rivall Carthage, Leptis, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tica, Cadiz, and Nola. The most plentifull proof they gave of their valour, was, when for three yeares they defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves against Nebuchadnezzar; and afterwards stopped the full career of Alexanders conquests; so that his victorious army which did flie into other countreys, was glad to creep into this citie. Yet after seven moneths siege (such is the omnipotency of industry) he forced it, and stripped this lady of the sea naked beyond modesty and mercy, putting all therein to the sword that resisted, and hanged up 2000 of the prime citizens in a rank along the sea-shore.</p>

               <p>Much time Baldwine spent in beholding this river, wherein he took many fishes, and his death in eating them: for a new surfet revived the grief of an old wound, which he many yeares before received at the siege of Ptolemais. His sicknesse put him in mind of his sinnes, conscience speaking loudest when men begin to grow speechlesse: And especially he grieved, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving another wife alive, he had married the Countesse of Sicilie, the relict of Earl Roger: But now heartily sorrowfull for his fault, he sent away this his last wife; yet we reade not that he received his former again.

could not be present, the desire was a sufficient proxy. He died at Latis, a city in the road from Egypt, and was brought to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, and buried on Palm-sunday in the temple of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchre, in the 18. yeare of his reigne.<note place="margin">1118</note>

               <head>Chap. 14. Baldwine the second chosen King; Prince Eustace peaceably renounceth his right.</head>
               <p>IT happened the same day King Baldwine was buried, that Baldwine de Burgo his kinsman and Count of Edessa came casually into the city, intending onely there to keep his Easter: when behold the Christian Princes met together for the electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:21984:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of a new King. The greater part did centre their suffrages on Prince Eustace, brother to the two former Kings, but then absent in France. They alledged, That it was not safe to break the chain of succession, where the inversion of order bringeth all to confusion; and, That it was high ingratitude to the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of Godfrey and Baldwine, to exclude their brother from the crown; especially he being fit in all points to be a King, wanting nothing but that he wanted to be there; That in the mean time some might be deputed to lock up all things safe, and to keep the keyes of the State till he should arrive.</p>
               <p>On the other side, some objected the dangers of an <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regnum,</hi> how when a State is headlesse, every malecontent would make head; inconveniences in other countreys would be mischiefs here, where they lived in the mouth of their enemies: and therefore to stay for a King, was the way to lose the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</p>
               <p>Then Joceline Prince of Tiberias, a man of great authoritie, offered himself a moderatour in this difference, and counselled both sides to this effect: To proceed to a present election, and therein to be directed not confined by succession; though they missed the next, let them take one of Godfreys kindred: As the case now stood, he must be counted next in bloud that was next at hand; and this was Baldwine Count of Edessa, on whom he bestowed most superlative praises. All were much affected with these his commendations; for they knew that Joceline was his sworn adversary, and concluded that it must needs be a mighty weight of worth in Baldwine, which pressed out praise from the mouth of his enemy: though indeed private ends prompted him to make this speech, who hoped himself to get the Earl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Edessa when Baldwine should be translated to Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem. However, his words took effect, and Baldwine hereupon was chosen King,<note place="margin">1118</note> and <note n="*" place="margin">

But he hearing that another was already in possession, though he was on his journey co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, quietly went back again. A large alms, to give away a Kingdome out of his charity to the publick cause.</p>
               <p>Baldwine was of a proper personage, and able body, born nigh Rhems in France, sonne to Hugh Count of Rorster and Millisent his wife.

               <p>ACcording to our wonted method, let us first rid out of the way Church-matters in this Kings reigne, that so we may have the more room to follow the affairs of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth. We left Arnulphus the last Patriarch of Jerusalem; since which time the bad savour of his life came to the Popes nose, who sent a Legate to depose him. But Arnulphus hasted to Rome with much <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Tyrius, lib.</hi> 11. <hi>cap.</hi> 26.</note> money, and there bought himself to be innocent, so that he enjoyed his place during his life.</p>
               <p>Guarimund succeeded in his place,<note place="margin">1119.</note> a very religious man, by whom God gave the Christians many victories. He called a Councel at Neapolis or Sichem, wherein many wholesome things were concluded for reformation of manners. Betwixt him and William Archbishop of Tyre (an English-man) there arose a difference, because this Archbishop would not receive his confirmation of him, (from whom by ancient right he should take it) but from the Pope, counting it the most honour to hold of the highest landlord. And indeed the Pope for gain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed him, though he should have sent him to the Patriarch. But the court of Rome careth not though men steal their corn, so be it they bring it to their mills to grind.</p>
               <p>After Guarimunds death,<note place="margin">1128.</note> Stephen Abbot of S. John de Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia was chosen Patriarch; once a cavalleer, but afterward laying down the sword, he took up the Word, and entred into Orders. He awaked the Patriarchs title to Jerusalem, which had slept during his three predecessours, and challenged it very imperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously of the King; for he was a man of spirit and metall. And indeed he had too much life to live long. For the King fearing what flame this spark might kindle, and finding him to be an active man, gave him (as it is suspected) a little more active poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:21984:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which cut him off in the midst of his age, and beginning of his projects.</p>
               <p>The King coming to him when he lay on his death-bed, asked him how he did: To whom he answered, My <note n="*" place="margin">

A cruel murder, if true: But it is strange,<note place="margin">1130.</note> that he whose hands (as we have said) were hardened with frequent prayer, should soften them again in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent bloud. Wherefore we will not condemn the memory of a King on doubtfull evidence.

               <p>Indeed at first they were very poore; in token whereof they gave for their <note n="*" place="margin">

brake their knees, it grew so heavy at last; and these ungratefull Templars did pluck out the feathers of those wings which hatched and brooded them. From Alms-men they turned Lords; and though very valiant at first (for they were sworn rather to die then to flie) afterwards lazinesse withered their arms, and swelled their bellies. They laughed at the rules of their first Institution, as at the swaddling-clothes of their infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie; neglecting the Patriarch, and counting themselves too old to be whipped with the rod of his discipline; till partly their vitiousnesse, and partly their wealth caused their finall extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as (God willing) shall be shewed <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>IT is worth the Readers marking, how this Kings reigne was checquered with variety of fortune: For first, Roger Prince of Antioch (or rather guardian in the minoritie of young Boe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund) went forth with greater courage then discretion;<note place="margin">

But Baldwine on the 14 of August following, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Turks to a restitution of their victorie, and with a small army gave them a great overthrow, in spite of Gazi their boasting Generall.</p>
               <p>To qualifie the Christians joy for this good successe,<note place="margin">1122</note> Joce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line unadvisedly fighting with Balak, a petty King of the Turks, was conquered and taken prisoner: and King Baldwine coming to deliver him, was also taken himself; for which he might thank his own rashnesse: For it had been his best work to have done nothing for a while, till the Venetian succours which were not farre off, had come to him; and not presently to adventure all to the hazard of a battel.</p>
               <p>Yet the Christians hands were not bound in the Kings capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity:
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:21984:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
For Eustace Grenier, chosen Vice-roy whilest the King was in durance, stoutly defended the countrey: and Count Joceline, which had escaped out of prison, fighting again with Balak at Hircapolis, routed his army, and killed him with his own hands. But the main piece of service was the taking of Tyre, which was done under the conduct of Guarimund the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch of Jerusalem; but chiefly by the help of the Venetian navy, which Michael their Duke brought, who for their pains were to have a third part of the city to themselves. Tyre had in it store of men and munition; but famine increasing (against whose arrows there is no armour of proof) it was yeelded on honourable terms. And though perhaps hunger shortly would have made the Turks digest courser conditions, yet the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians were loth to anger their enemies valour into desperate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>

               <p>KIng Baldwine a little before his death renounced the world, and took on him a religious habit. This was the fashion of many Princes in that age; though they did it for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ends. Some thought to make amends for their disorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lives by entring into some holy order at their deaths: O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers having surfeted of the worlds vanitie, fasted from it when they could eat no more because of the impotency of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies: Others being crossed by the world by some misfortune, sought to crosse the world again in renouncing of it. These like furious gamesters threw up their cards, not out of dislike of ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming but of their game; and they were rather discontented to live then contented to die. But we must beleeve that Baldwine did it out of true devotion, to ripen himself for heaven, because he was piously affected from his youth; so that all his life was religiously tuned, though it made the sweetest musick in the close. He died not long after, on the 22 of August, in the 13 yeare of his reigne; and was buried with his predecessours in the temple of the Sepulchre. By Morphe a Grecian Lady his wife, he had foure daughters: whereof Millesent was the eldest; the second Alice, married to young Boemund Prince of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och; the third Hodiern, wife to Reimund Prince of Tripoli; and Mete the youngest, Abbesse of Bethanie.</p>

Wherefore knowing himself to need strong arms who was to swim against the stream, he wrought himself into the favour of the Princesse of Antioch, the widow of young Boemund, so that he commanded all her command, and beat down his enemies with her strength. He promised to make a marriage betwixt her and Reimund Earl of Poictou, (a Frenchman of great fame, who was coming into these parts) but he deceived her, and caused the Earl to marry Constantia the daughter of this Lady, by whom he had the principality of Antioch. Indeed this Constantia was but a child for age; but they never want yeares to marry, who have a Kingdome for their portion.</p>
               <p>The Patriarch to make firre work, bound Prince Reimund by an oath to be true to him: But friends unjustly gotten, are seldome comfortably enjoyed: Of his sworn friend, he proved his sworn enemy, and forced him to go up to Rome, there to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer many accusations laid to his charge; wherein the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work perchance was true, though malice might set the varnish
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:21984:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
on it. The main matter was, that he made odious comparisons betwixt Antioch and Rome, and counted himself equall to his Holinesse.</p>
               <p>Rodolphus coming to Rome found the Popes doores shut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him, but he opened them with a golden key. Money he sowed plentifully, and reaped it when he came to be tried; for he found their hands very soft towards him whom formerly he had greased in the fist. He also resigned his old pall, and took a new one from the Pope. As for his other crimes, it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that Albericus Bishop of Ostia should be sent into Syria the Popes Legate, to examine matters, and to proceed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly with the Patriarch as things there should be found al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged and proved: Whereat his adversaries much stormed, who expected that he should instantly have been deposed.</p>
               <p>Yet afterwards they prevailed mightily with Albericus the Legate, and bowed him on their side. He coming to Antioch cited the Patriarch to appear; who being thrice called, came not. On his absence all were present with their conjectures what should cause it: Some imputing it to his guiltinesse; others to his contempt; others to his fear of his enemies potencie, or judges partiality: for indeed the Legate came not with a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-judgement, but ravished with prejudice; being preposses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed with this intent to dispossesse him of his place. Some thought he relied on his peace formerly made at Rome, where the illegality of his election was rectified by his laying down his first pall, and assuming a new one from the Pope.</p>
               <p>Here was it worth the beholding in what severall <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Baronius, in anno</hi> 1136.</note> streams mens affections ran. All wished that the tree might be felled, who had hopes to gather chips by his fall; and especially one Arnulphus, and Dean Lambert, the promoters against the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch. Others pitied him, and though perchance content that his roof might be taken down, were loth he should be razed to the ground. Some reserved their affections till they were coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selled by the event which side to favour; and would not be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by any manifest declaration, but so that they might fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retreat if need required. Amongst other Prelates which were present, Serlo Archbishop of Apamea was one, who formerly had been a great enemy to the Patriarch, but had lately taken himself off from that course. The Legate demanded of him why he proceeded not to accuse the Patriarch as he was wont: To whom he answered,
<q>

Hereupon the Legate immediately (such

                     <hi>Vide suprà,</hi> book 1. chap. 15.</note> he refused it: so fair a tender was a paiment. Others argued, That that generation which made this contract was wholly dead, and that the debt descend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not on them to make it good. But most insisted on this, That Alexius kept not his covenants, and assisted them not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the agreement. Indeed he called these Princes his sonnes; but he disinherited them of their hopes, and all their portion was in promises never payed. No reason then, that the knot of the agreement should hold them fast, and let him loose.</p>
               <p>The worst of these answers had been good enough, if their swords had been as strong as the Grecian Emperours.

with some other Princes, fearing what wofull conclusion would follow so violent premisses, made a composition between them.

               <p>NO great service of moment was performed in the reigne of King Fulk, because he was molested with domesticall dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, and intestine warres against Paulinus Count of Tripoli, and Hugh Earl of Joppa: Onely Beersheba was fortified, and some forts built about Askelon, as an introduction to besiege it. Also skirmishes were now and then fought with variety of successe, against Sanguin one of the Turks great Princes.</p>
               <p>And here let the reader take notice, that though we have mentioned many Commanders, as Auxianus, Corboran, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miravissus, Tenduc, Gazi, Balak, Dordequin, Borscquin, San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guin, some Turkish, some Saracen, yet none of these were ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Kings (though perchance in courtesie sometimes so styled by writers) but were onely Generals &amp; Lieutenants accountable to their superiours, the Caliphs either of Babylon or Egypt: Who what they were, we referre the reader to our Chronologie.</p>
               <p>Caliph was the Pope (as I may say) of the Saracens, a mixture of Priest and Prince. But we need not now trouble our selves with curiosity in their successions; these Caliphs being but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure men, who confined themselves to pleasures, making play their work, and having their constant diet on the sawce of recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. We are rather to take notice of their Generals and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptains, which were the men of action. For a Souldan (which was but a Vice-roy) with his borrowed light shineth brighter in

history then the Caliph himself. Yet may we justly wonder, that these slothfull Caliphs should do nothing themselves, and commit such unlimited power to their Souldans; especially seeing too much trust is a strong tentation to make ambitious flesh and bloud disloyall.

Childerick, Theodorick, Clovis, Childebert, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gobert, &amp;c. a chain of idle Kings well linked together, gave themselves over to pleasures privately, never coming abroad; but onely on May-day they shewed themselves to the people, riding in a chariot, adorned with flowers, and drawn with oxen, (slow cattel, but good enough for so lazy luggage) whilest Charles Martell and Pipin, Maiors of the palace, opened pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, gave audience to Embassadours, made warre or peace, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted and repealed laws at pleasure, till afterwards from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trollers of the Kings houshold they became controllers of the Kings, and at last Kings themselves.</p>

               <p>Now as these Hospitallers wronged the power of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, so did they rob the profit of poore Priests, refusing to pay any tithes of their Mannours, which contained many pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishes (so that the Pastours who fed the flocks, were starved themselves; and having laboured all day in the vineyard, were at night sent supperlesse to bed) the Hospitallers pleading that the Pope had freed them from these duties; as if an acquittance under the hand of his Holinesse was sufficient to discharge them from paying of tithes, a debt due to God.

               <p>THe late-come Pilgrimes having sufficiently recreated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, the Emperour and the King of France concluded to besiege Damascus: for a small town was conceived too narrow an object of their valour, whilest so eminent an action was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate to the undertakers. Damascus is so pleasant a citie, that Mahomet durst never enter into it, lest this deceiver should be deceived himself, and be so ravished with the pleasures of the place, that he should forget to go on in that great work he had in hand. Some make Eliezer Abrahams steward builder of this citie, because he is called Eliezer of Damascus; though that phrase speaketh him rather to have had his birth or dwelling there, then the citie her building from him. To passe this by, because as the foundations are hidden in the ground, so the founders of most ancient places are forgotten. It was for many yeares after the Metropolis of Syria,<note place="margin">1148</note> and was now straitly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieged by the Christians with great hope of successe, had they not afterwards fallen out amongst themselves who should eat the chickens before they were hatched. Conrade and King Lewis destined the city to Theodorick Earl of Flanders, lately arrived in those parts; whilest other Princes which had been long resident in Palestine, and born the heat of the warre, grudged hereat: and their stomachs could not digest the crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of a raw upstart to be preferred before them. Yea, some of the Christians corrupted with Turkish money (though when they received it, it proved but <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>The French proverb was verified of this voyage, Much bruit and little fruit. They not onely did no good in the Holy land (<note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> save that some think their coming advantaged King Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wine for the taking of the citie of Askelon) but also did much harm. For now the Turks seeing one citie both bear the brunt and batter the strength of both armies, began to conceive that their own fear was their greatest enemy; and those swords of these new Pilgrimes which they dreaded in the sheath, they sleighted when they saw them drawn; and shook off that aw

which had formerly possessed them, of the strength of the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stern Emperour.

               <p>We must not forget how the French King coming home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was taken prisoner by the fleet of the Grecian Emperour, and rescued again by Gregory Admirall to Roger King of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilie.

He gave her back again all the lands in France which he had received with her in por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; scorning her wealth which neglected his love.

               <p>But much may be alledged truly to excuse this good man:</p>

               <p>Secondly, the true cause of the ill successe was the vitious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the undertakers.

<q>If we should say that Bernard that holy Abbot was inspired by Gods Spirit to incite us to this warre, but we through our pride and wantonnesse not observing his holy commands deservedly brought on our selves the losse of our goods and lives, we should say nothing but what is agreeable to reason, and to ancient examples.</q>
However, it was an heavy afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to S.

               <p>And surely this humiliation was both wholesome and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary for him. For the people, who cannot love without doting, nor approve without admiring, were too much transported with an high opinion of this man and his directions; as if that arrow could not misse the mark which came out of S.

And no doubt he made a good use of this bad accident. The lesse his fame blazed, the more his devotion burned; and the cutting off of his top, made him take deep root, and to be made more truly humbled and sanctified.

               <p>UPon the departure of Emperour Conrade and King Lewis, Noradine the Turk much prevailed in Palestine.<note place="margin">1149</note> Nor was he little advantaged by the discords betwixt Millesent Queen-mother and the Nobility; thus occasioned: There was a No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble-man called Manasses, whom the Queen (governing all in her sonnes minority) made Constable of the kingdome. This man unable to manage his own happinesse, grew so insolent that he could not go, but either spurning his equals, or trampling on his inferiours. No wonder then, if envy the shadow of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse waited upon him. The <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Tyrius, lib.</hi> 17. <hi>cap.</hi> 13.</note> Nobility highly distasted him: but in all oppositions the Queens favour was his sanctuary; who to shew her own absolutenesse, and that her affection should not be controlled, nor that thrown down which she set up, still preserved the creature she had made.</p>
               <p>His enemies perceiving him so fast rooted in her favour, and seeing they could not remove him from his foundation, sought to remove him with his foundation; instigating young King Baldwine against his mother, and especially against her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite. They complained how the State groned under his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solency; He was the bridge by which all offices must passe, and there pay toll; He alone sifted all matters, and then no wonder if much bran passed; He under pretense of opening the Queens eyes did lead her by the nose, captivating her judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in stead of directing it; He like a by-gulf devoured her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which should flow to her children. They perswaded the King he was ripe for government, and needed none to hold his hand to hold the sceptre. Let him therefore either untie or cut himself loose from this slavery, and not be in subjection to a subject.</p>
               <p>Liberty needeth no hard pressing on youth, a touch on that stamp maketh an impression on that waxen age.

               <p>IN the Church of Jerusalem we find Amalrick still Patriarch: A Frenchman born, but little fit for the place to which he was preferred by the favour of Sibyll, Countesse of Flanders, the Kings sister. Mean time the Church needed a Salick law, to forbid distaffs to meddle with mitres; and neither to be, nor to make Patriarchs.</p>
               <p>But the most remarkable Church-matter in this Kings reigne, was the clandestine christening of a Sultan of Iconium. And more of his courtiers might have followed him,<note place="margin">

But the master proudly answered, That he had already enjoyned him penance, and had directed to send him to the Pope, but stoutly refused to surrender him to the King. This cruel murder embittered the Assasines more desperately against the Christians.</p>
               <p>These Assasines were a precise sect of Mahometans, and had in them the very spirits of that poysonous superstition. They had some six cities, and were about fourty thousand in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, living neare Antaradus in Syria.

               <p>EGypt was the stage whereon the most remarkable passages in the reigne of King Almerick were acted. It will be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary therefore to premise somewhat concerning the estate of that kingdome at this time. Whilest the Turks thus lorded it in Syria and the lesser Asia, the Saracen Caliph commanded in Egypt; under whom, two great Lords, Dargan and Sanar, fell out about the Sultanie or Vice-royship of that land. But Sanar fearing he should be worsted by Dargan, sued to Noradine King of the Turks at Damascus for aid: who sent him an army of Turks, under the command of Syracon an experienced Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptain, against Sultan Dargan.<note place="margin">1165</note> So Dargan and Sanar met and fought. The victory was Dargans, but he enjoyed it not long, being shortly after slain by treachery; whereby Sanar recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Sultans place. Mean time how strange was the voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lethargie of the Caliph Elhadach, to pursue his private plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, whilest his Vice-royes thus fought under his nose, and imployed forrein succours, yet he never regarded it; as if the tottering of his kingdome had rocked him fast asleep.</p>
               <p>Nor was he moved with that which followed, and more near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned him. For Syracon the Turkish Captain, whom Sanar had gotten to come into Egypt, would not be intreated to go home again; but seized on the city of Belbis, fortified it, and there attended the arrivall of more Turks from Damascus, for the conquest of Egypt. Which afterwards they performed, the land being never completely cleared of them, till at last they conquered the whole kingdome, partly under this Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racon,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:21984:55"/>
and wholly under Saladine his nephew.</p>
               <p>And here my discourse (by the leave of the reader) must a little sally forth to treat of the danger of entertaining merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary souldiers. They may perchance be called in with a whistle, but scarce cast out with a whip. If they be slugs, they indanger a State by their slothfulnesse; if spirited men, by their activity. Cesar Borgia, Machiavells idol, whose practice he maketh the pattern of policie, saith, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mach. Prince, cap.</hi> 9. Se malle vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci suis armis quàm alienis victorem esse.</note> That he had rather be conquered with his own men, then be conquerour with an army of others; because he counted that conquest to be none at all.</p>
               <p>Yet good physick may be made of poyson well corrected: They may sometimes be necessary evils; yea, good and service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to defend a land, if thus qualified: First, if they have no command of castles, or place neare about the Princes person: for then they have a compendious way to treason, if they intend it. Secondly, if they be not entertained in too great numbers, but in such refracted degrees, that the natives may still have the predominancie: for a surfeit of forrein supplies is a disease incurable. Thirdly, if the Prince who imployeth them, hath their wives, children, and estates in his own hands; which will be both a caution and pawn for their fidelity, and will also in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest their affections more cordially in the cause. Lastly, if they be of the same religion with them, and fight against the enemy of the religion of both: for then they are not purely hirelings, but parties in part, and the cause doth at least medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately concern them. I beleeve that it will scarcely be shown, that the Protestants have turned tails and betrayed them they came to assist.</p>
               <p>We may observe, the Low-countreys have best thrived by setting this trade of journey-men-souldiers on work. Let them thank God and the good English: for if Francis Duke of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou with his Frenchmen had well succeeded, no doubt he would have spread his bread with their butter. Next them the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians have sped best: for they have the trick, when they find it equally dangerous to casheer their mercenary Generall or to entertain him any longer, fairly to kill him; as they served <note n="*" place="margin">

But Syracon would not so quickly quit the countrey; but goeth to the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liph of Babylon (who was opposite to him of Egypt, each of them claiming as heir to Mahomet that false prophet, the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty over all that were of the Saracen law) &amp; offereth him his means for the exstirpation of this schismaticall Caliph, and the reduction of all Egypt to the subjection of the Babylonian.

               <p>Sanar affrighted hereat maketh new and larger proffers to King Almerick to stop this deluge of his enemies, and proffereth him a pension of fourty thousand ducats yearly for his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hooffull assistance.

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:21984:56"/>
state; till at last they were brought to the Caliphs own lod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging. Where entring the presence, the Sultan thrice prostrated himself to the ground before the curtain behind which the Caliph sat. Presently the traverse wrought with pearls was opened, and the Caliph himself discovered, sitting with great majesty on a throne of gold, having few of his most inward eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs about him.</p>
               <p>The Sultan humbly kissed his masters feet, and briefly told him the cause of their coming, the danger wherein the land stood, the proffers he had made to King Almerick, desiring him now to ratifie them, and in demonstration thereof to give his hand to the Kings Embassadours. The Caliph demurred here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at, as counting such a gesture a diminution to his State; and at no hand would give him his hand bare, but gave it in his glove. To whom the resolute Earl of <note n="*" place="margin">

This act of Meller must be condemned, but withall Gods justice admired. Christians break their covenant with Saracens in Egypt, whilest other Christians, to punish them, make and keep covenant with Turks in Asia.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, the Saracens grew good souldiers on a sudden: who were naked at first, and onely had bows; but now learned from the Christians to use all offensive and defensive weapons. Thus rude nations alwayes better themselves in fighting with a skilfull enemy. How good mark-men are the Irish now-a-dayes, which some seventy yeares ago, at the beginning of their rebellions, had three men to discharge a <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Fourthly, Almericks hopes of conquering Egypt were fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strated;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:21984:57"/>
for after some victories he was driven out, and that whole kingdome conquered by Saladine (nephew to Syracon) who killed the Caliph with his horse-mace as he came to do him reverence, and made himself the absolutest Turkish King of Egypt.<note place="margin">1173</note> And presently after the death of Noradine, the kingdome of the Turks at Damascus was by their consent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed upon him.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>May.</hi>
                  </note> Indeed Noradine left a sonne, Melexala, who commanded in part of his fathers dominions; but Saladine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death got all for himself. Thus rising men shall still meet with more stairs to raise them; as those of falling, with stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-blocks to ruine them.</p>
               <p>Mean time Jerusalem was a poore weather-beaten king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, bleak and open to the storm of enemies on all sides, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no covert or shelter of any good friend neare it, lying in the lions mouth betwixt his upper and nether jaw; Damascus on the North, and Egypt on the South; two potent Turkish kingdomes, united under a puissant Prince, Saladine. This made Almerick send for succours into Europe: for now few volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries came to this service; souldiers must be pressed with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity. Our Western Princes were prodigall of their pity, but niggardly of their help: The heat of the warre in Palestine had cooled their desires to go thither: which made these Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadours to return without supplies, having gone farre to fetch home nothing but discomfort and despair.</p>
               <p>Lastly, King Almerick himself wearied with whole volleys of miseries, ended his life of a bloudy flux, having reigned eleven full yeares; and was buried with his predecessours: Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving two children, Baldwine and Sibyll, by Agnes his first wife: and by Mary his second wife (daughter to John Proto-Seba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stus, a Grecian Prince) one daughter, Isabell; married <note n="*" place="margin">

King Henry was singled out for this service before other Princes, because the world justly reported him valiant, wise, rich, powerfull, and fortunate: And (which was the main) hereby he might expiate his murder, and gather up again the innocent bloud which he had shed of Thomas Becket. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, Heraclius entituled our Henry to the kingdome of Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, because Geoffrey Plantagenet his father was sonne (some say, brother) to Fulk the fourth, King of Jerusalem. But King Henry was too wise to bite at such a bait, wherein was onely the husk of title, without the kernel of profit. Yet he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended he would go into Palestine; and got hereby a masse of money towards his voyage: making every one, as well Clerk as Lay (saving such as went) to pay that yeare the tenth of all their revenues, moveables, and chattells, as well in gold as in silver.

               <head>Chap. 40. Saladine fitteth himself with forrein forces. The originall and great power of the Mammalukes, with their first service.</head>
               <p>IN the minority of King Baldwine, who was but thirteen yeares old, Milo de Plancia Noble-man was Protectour of the Realm: Whose pride and insolence could not be brooked; and therefore he was stabbed at Ptolemais, and Reimund Count of Tripoli chosen to succeed him.</p>
               <p>Now Saladine seriously intendeth to set on the Kingdome of Jerusalem, and seeketh to furnish himself with souldiers for that service. But he perceived that the ancient nation of the Egy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptians had lasted so long, that now it ranne dregs; their spirits being as low as the countrey they lived in, and they fitter to make merchants and mechanicks then military men: For they were bred in such soft imployments, that they were presently foundred with any hard labour. Wherefore he sent to the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cassians by the lake of Meotis, neare Taurica Chersonesus, and thence bought many slaves of able and active bodies. For it was a people born in a hard countrey (no fewel for pleasure grew there nor was brought thither) and bred harder; so that warre was almost their nature, with custome of continuall skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishing with the neighbouring Tartars.</p>
               <p>These slaves he trained up in military discipline, most of them being Christians once baptized; but afterwards untaught Christ, they learned Mahomet, and so became the worse foes to religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for once being her friends. These proved excellent soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and speciall horsemen, and are called Mammalukes. And
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:21984:59"/>
surely the greatnesse of Saladine and his successours stood not so much on the legs of their native Egyptians, as it leaned on the staff of these strangers. Saladine, and especially the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Kings after him, gave great power, and placed much trust in these <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Tyrius, lib.</hi> 21. <hi>cap.</hi> 23.</note> Mammalukes: Who lived a long time in ignorance of their own strength, till at last they took notice of it, and scorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any longer to be factours for another, they would set up for themselves, and got the sovereignty from the Turkish Kings. Thus Princes who make their subjects over-great, whet a knife for their own throats. And posterity may chance to see the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solent Janizaries give the grand Seignor such a trip on the heel as may tumble him on his back. But more largely of these Mammalukes usurping the kingdome of Egypt (God willing) in its proper place.</p>
               <p>Thus Saladine having furnished himself with new souldiers, went to handsel their valour upon the Christians; invaded the Holy land, burning all the countrey before him, and raging in the bloud of poore Christians, till he came and encamped about Askelon.</p>
               <p>Mean time whilest Reimund Count of Tripoli, Protectour of the Kingdome, with Philip Earl of Flanders, &amp; the chief strength of the Kingdome were absent in Celosyria, wasting the countrey about Emissa and Cesarea, young King Baldwine lay close in Askelon, not daring to adventure on so strong an enemy. With whose fear Saladine encouraged, dispersed his army, some one way,<note place="margin">1176</note> some another, to forrage the countrey. King Baldwine courted with this opportunity,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Nov.</hi> 25.</note> marched out privately, not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving past foure hundred horse, with some few footmen, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saulted his secure enemies, being six and twenty thousand. But victory standeth as little in the number of souldiers, as verity in the plurality of voices. The Christians got the conquest, and in great triumph returned to Jerusalem.</p>
               <p>This overthrow rather madded then daunted Saladine: Who therefore to recover his credit, some moneths after with his Mammalukes fell like a mighty tempest upon the Christians, as they were parting the spoil of a band of Turks, whom they had vanquished; put many to the sword, the rest to flight. Otto grand Master of the Templars, and Hugh sonne in law to the Count of Tripoli, were taken prisoners; and the King himself had much ado to escape. And thus both sides being well wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with warre, they were glad to refresh themselves with a short slumber of a truce solemnly concluded; and their trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled estates breathed almost for the space of two yeares.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1181</note>BUt this so welcome a calm was troubled with domesticall discords. For the Kings mother (a woman of a turbulent spirit) and her brother his steward, accused Reimund Count of Tripoli, governour of the Realm in the Kings minority, as if he affected the Crown for himself: which accusation this Earl could never wholly wipe off. For slender and lean slanders quickly consume themselves; but he that is branded with an hainous crime (though false) when the wound is cured, his cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit will be killed with the scarre. Before we go further, let us view this Earl Reimunds disposition, and we shall find him marked to do mischief, and to ruine this Realm. He was sonne to Reimund, grandchild to Pontius Earl of Tripoli, by Cecilie the daughter of <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Tyrius, lib.</hi> 21. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</note> Philip King of France, great-grandchild to Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram first Earl of Tripoli, great-great-grandchild to Reimund Earl of Tholose, one of speciall note amongst the primitive adventurers in the Holy warre. His mother was Hodiern, third daughter of Baldwine the second, King of Jerusalem. A man whose stomach was as high as his birth; and very serviceable to this State, whilest the sharpnesse of his parts were used against the Turks; which at last turned edge against the Christians: Proud, not able to digest the least wrong; and though long in captivity amongst the Turks, yet a very treuant in the school of affliction, who never learned the lesson of patience: So revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, that he would strike his enemy, though it were through the sides of religion and the Christian cause. For this present ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cusation of treason, good authours seem to be his compurga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours for this at this time, though afterwards he discovered his treacherous intents. And because he could not rise by his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he made his service fall by him; and undid what he had done for the publick good, because thereby he could not attain his private ends. He commanded over the Earldome of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poli, which was a territory of large extent, wherein he was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Lord. And by the way we may take notice of this as one of the banes of the Kingdome of Jerusalem, That the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities of Antioch, Tripoli, and Edessa (whilest it was Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian) were branches of this Kingdome, but too big for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: For the Princes thereof on each petty distast would stand on their guard; as if they had been subjects out of courtesie, not conscience: and though they confessed they owed the King
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:21984:60"/>
allegeance, yet they would pay no more then they thought fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themselves.</p>
               <p>To return to King Baldwine; This suspicion of Earl Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund, though at first but a buzze, soon got a sting in the Kings head, and he violently apprehended it. Whereupon Reimund coming to Jerusalem, was by the way commanded to stay, to his great disgrace. But some of the Nobility foreseeing what danger this discord might bring, reconciled them with much labour. However, Baldwine ever after looked on this Earl with a jealous eye. Jealousie, if it be fire in private persons, is wild-fire in Princes, who seldome rase out their names whom once they have written in their black bills. And as the Italian proverb is, Suspicion giveth a passe-port to faith to set it on packing; so this Earl finding himself suspected, was never after cordially loyall, smothering his treachery in this Kings life, which afterwards broke forth into an open flame.</p>

               <p>THe kingdome of Damascus being recovered of the famine, Saladine having gotten his ends by the truce, would now have the truce to end; and breaking it (as not standing with his haughty designes) marched with a great army out of Egypt through Palestine to Damascus, much spoiling the countrey. And now having joyned the Egyptian with the Damascene forces, re-entred the Holy land. But young King Baldwine meeting him,<note place="margin">

Afterward he besieged Berytus both by sea &amp; land: but the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancie and valour of King Baldwine defeated his taking of it.</p>
               <p>Saladine finding such tough resistance in the Holy land, thought to make a better purchase by laying out his time in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sopotamia. Wherefore passing Euphrates, he wonne Charran and divers other cities: and then returning, in Syria besieged Aleppo the strongest place the Christians had in that countrey;
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:21984:60"/>
so fortified by nature, that he had little hope to force it. But treason will runne up the steepest ascent, where valour it self can scarce creep: and Saladine with the battery of bribes made such a breach in the loyaltie of the governour, that he betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it unto him.</p>
               <p>Thus he cometh again into the Holy land more formidable then ever before, carrying an army of terrour in the mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his name, which drove the poore Christians all into their fenced cities. As for King Baldwine, the leprosie had arrested him prisoner, and kept him at home. Long had this Kings spirit endured this infirmity, swallowing many a bitter pang with a smiling face, and going upright with patient shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders under the weight of his disease. It made him put all his might to it, because when he yeelded to his sicknesse, he must leave off the managing of the State; and he was loth to put off his royall robes before he went to bed, a Crown being too good a companion for one to part with willingly. But at last he was made to stoop,<note place="margin">1183</note> and retired himself to a private life, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Baldwine his nephew (a child of five yeares old) his succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sour; and Guy Earl of Joppa and Askelon, this childs father in law, to be Protectour of the Realm in his minority.</p>
               <p>But soon after he revoked this latter act, and designed Rei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Earl of Tripoli for the Protectour. He displaced Guy, because he found him of no over-weight worth, scarce passable without favourable allowance, little feared of his foes, and as little loved of his friends. The more martiall Christians sleight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him as a slug, and neglected so lazy a leader that could not keep pace with those that were to follow him: Yea, they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed (whilest he was Protectour) at his command to fight with Saladine; and out of distast to their Generall, suffered their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie freely to forrage; which was never done before: For the Christians never met any Turks wandring in the Holy land, but on even terms they would examine their passe-port how suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent it was, and bid them battel.</p>
               <p>Guy stormed at his displacing, and though little valiant, yet very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ullen, left the Court in discontent, went home, and fortified his cities of Joppa and Askelon. What should King Baldwine do in this case? Whom should he make Protectour? Guy had too little, Reimund too much spirit for the place. He feared Guy's cowardlinesse, lest he should lose the kingdome to the Turks; and Reimunds treachery, lest he should get it for himself.

               <p>WHilest Heraclius did Patriarch it in Jerusalem, one Haymericus had the same honour at Antioch. He wrote to Henry the second King of England, a bemoning let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Christians in the East, and from him received ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, fraught with never-performed fair promises.

I must confesse, it passeth my Chymistrie to extract any agreement herein out of the contrariety of writers. We must also take notice, that besides the Latine Patriarchs in Jerusalem and Antioch, there were also Grecian Anti-patriarchs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Emperour of Constantinople: who having no temporall power nor profit by Church-lands, had onely juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction over those of the Greek Church.

               <p>Antioch also had her Greek Patriarchs: As one Sotericus, displaced for maintaining some unsound tenets about our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: After him Theodorus Balsamon, the oracle of the learned Law in his age.

Balsamon took upon him to prove it: and a Lawyers brains will beat to purpose when his own preferment is the fee. But herein he did but crack the nut for another to eat the kernel: For the Emperour mutable in his mind, changing his favourites as well as his clothes before they were old, when the legality of the translation was avowed, bestowed the Patriarchship of Constantinople on another; and Theodorus was still staked down at Antioch in a true spirituall preferment, affording him little bodily maintenance.</p>

               <head>Chap. 45. The revolt of the Earl of Tripoli; The Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans irrecoverably overthrown, and their King taken prisoner.</head>
               <p>THere was at this time a truce betwixt the Christians and Saladine,<note place="margin">1187</note> broken on this occasion: Saladines mother went from Egypt to Damascus, with much treasure and a little train, as sufficiently guarded with the truce yet in force: when Reinold of Castile surprised and robbed her. Saladine glad of this occasion, gathereth all his strength together, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siegeth Ptolemais.</p>
               <p>Now Reimund Earl of Tripoli appeareth in his colours, vexed at the losse of the government. His great stomach hath no room for patience: and his passions boyled from a fever to a phrensie; so that blinded with anger at King Guy, he mistaketh his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and will be revenged on God and religion; revolting with his Principalitie (a third part of the Kingdome of Jerusalem) to Saladine; and in his own person under a visard, assisted him in this siege.</p>
               <p>Out of the citie marched the Templars and Hospitallers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>May</hi> 1.</note> and falling on the Turks killed twentie thousand of them.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:21984:62"/>
Yet they gave welnigh a valuable consideration for their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory, the master of the Hospitallers being slain; and a brave Generall in battel never dieth unattended.</p>
               <p>Saladine hereupon raiseth his siege; and Reimund Earl of Tripoli, whether out of fear the Christians might prevail, or remorse of conscience, or discontent, not finding that respect he expected of Saladine (who had learned that politick maxime, To give some honour, no trust to a fugitive) reconciled himself to King Guy; and sory for his former offense, returned to the Christians.</p>
               <p>King Guy hereupon gathering the whole strength of his weak Kingdome to do their last devoir, determined to bid Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladine battel; though having but fifteen hundred horse and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thousand foot, against an hundred and twenty thousand horse and an hundred and sixty thousand foot.<note place="margin">

More Christians (thirsty within and scalded without) were killed with the beams the sunne darted then with the arrows the enemies shot. Reinold of Castile was slain, with most of the Templars and Hospitallers. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Besoldus, in Guidone; ex Crusio.</hi>
                  </note> Gerard Master of the Templars, and Boniface Marquesse of Montferrat were taken prisoners; and also Guy the King, who saw the rest of his servants slain before his eyes, onely obtaining of Saladine the life of his schoolmaster. Yea, in this battel the flower of the Christian chevalrie was cut down: and what was most lamented, the Crosse (saith Matthew Paris) which freed men from the captivity of their sinnes, was for mens sinnes ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken captive. Most impute this overthrow to the Earl of Tripoli, who that day commanded a great part of the Christian army, and is said of some treacherously to have fled away. But when a great action miscarrieth, the blame must be laid on some; and commonly it lighteth on them who formerly have been found false, be it right or wrong: So impossible is it for him who once hath broken his credit by treason, ever to have it perfectly joynted again. It increaseth the suspicion, because this Earl, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards found dead in his bed (as some say) was circumcised.</p>
               <p>Victorious Saladine, as he had thrown a good cast, played it as well; in a moneth conquering Berytus, Biblus, Ptolemais, and all the havens (Tyre excepted) from Sidon to Askelon. He used his conquest with much moderation, giving lives &amp; goods to all, and forcing no Christians to depart their cities, save onely the Latines. This his gentlenesse proceeded from policy, well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if the Christians could not buy their lives cheap, they
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:21984:63"/>
would sell them deare, and fight it out to the uttermost. Aske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon was stout, and would not surrender. Wherefore Saladine, loth with the hazard of so long a siege to check his fortune in the full speed, left it, and went to Jerusalem, as to a place of lesse difficulty and more honour to conquer.</p>

For though those within the city vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly defended it for a fortnight, yet they saw it was but the playing out of a desperate game which must be lost: Their foes neare, their friends farre off; and those willing to pity, unable to help.

All Latines were cast out of the citie; but those of the Greek religion were permitted to stay therein: Onely Saladine to two Frenchmen gave liberty to abide there, and maintenance to live on, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to their age:<note place="margin">

               <p>Saladine possessed of Jerusalem, turned the churches into sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, sparing onely that of the Sepulchre for a great summe of money. Solomons Temple he converted to a Mosque, sprin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kling it all over with rose-water, as if he would wash it from profanenesse, whilest he profaned it with his washing.</p>
               <p>Thus Jerusalem after it had fourescore and eight yeares been enjoyed by the Christians, by Gods just judgement was taken again by the Turks. What else could be expected? Sinne reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in every corner; there was scarce <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>This dolefull news brought into Europe, filled all with sighs and sorrows. Pope Urbane the third (as another Eli at the Arks

               <p>In this generall grief of Christendome there was one woman found to rejoyce, and she a German Prophetesse called S. Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian, a virgin. Who as she had foretold the day of the defeat, so on the same she professed that she saw in a vision Christ and his Angels rejoycing. For the losse of the earthly Canaan was gain to the heavenly; peopling it with many inhabitants, who were conquerours in their overthrow; whilest they <note n="*" place="margin">Quandam morti Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toris vicem cum multa devotione re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendunt, <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1187.</note> requited Christs passion, and died for him who suffered for them.

But by his leave, though the first of his observations be true, the second is a flat falsitie, the third a foul mistake, and may thus be mended: (It is charity to lend a crutch to a lame conceit) When the Crosse was taken from the Persians, Heraclius was Emperour; and when it was taken from the Turks, Heraclius was Patriarch. Thus these curious observations (like over-small watches) not one of a hundred goeth true. Though it cannot be denied, but the same name (as Henry of England, one the winne-all, another the lose-all in France) hath often been happy and unhappy in founding and confounding of kingdomes.

But soon after Isaac was sick of this Physician who had cured his Empire. If private debters care not for the company of their creditours, much lesse do Princes love to see them to whom they ow themselves and their kingdome: so unwelcome are courtesies to them when above their requitall. Now it is an

To this end Isaacius by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasions of some spurred on Conrade (free enough of himself to any noble action) to go into Palestine, there to support the ruinous affairs of the Christians. Conrade was sensible of their plot, but suffered himself to be wrought on, being weary of the Grecians basenesse; and came into the Holy land with a brave company of Gentlemen furnished on their own cost.</p>

               <p>MAtters going thus wofully in Palestine, the Christians sighs there were alarms to stirre up their brethren in Europe to go to help them, and chiefly Frederick Barbarossa the Germane Emperour. Impute it not to the weaknesse of his judgement, but the strength of his devotion, that at seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty yeares of age, having one foot in his grave, he would set the other on Pilgrimage. We must know that this Emperour had been long tied to the stake, and baited with seven fresh successive Popes; till at last not conquered with the strength, but wearied with the continuance of their malice, he gave himself up to be ordered by them; and Pope Clement the third sent him on this voyage into the Holy land.</p>

                  </note> he was welcomed by King Bela. But changing his host, his entertainment was changed; being basely used when he entred into the Grecian Empire.</p>
               <p>Of the Emperours whereof we must speak somewhat. For though being to write the Holy warre I will climbe no hedges, to trespasse on any other story; yet will I take leave to go the high-way, and touch on the succession of those Princes which lead to the present discourse.</p>
               <p>When Conrade Emperour of Germanie last passed this way, Emmanuel was Emperour in Greece: Who having reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thirtie eight yeares, left his place to Alexius his sonne: A youth, the depth of whose capacitie onely reached to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand pleasure; governed by the factious nobilitie, till in his third yeare he was strangled by Andronicus his cousin.</p>
               <p>Andronicus succeeded him; a diligent reader and a great lover of <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> S. Pauls epistles, but a bad practiser of them: Who rather observing the Devils rule, That it is the best way for those who have been bad, to be still worse, fensing his former villanies by committing new ones, held by tyrannie what he had gotten by usurpation; till having lived in the bloud of others, he died in his own, tortured to death by the headlesse multitude; from whom he received all the cruelties which might be expected from servile natures when they command.</p>
               <p>Then Isaacius Angelus, of the Emperiall bloud, was placed
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:21984:67"/>
in his throne; of whom partly <note n="*" place="margin">

He succeeded also to their suspicions against the Latines, as if they came through his countrey for some sinister ends. This jealous Emperour reigned when Frederick with his armie passed this way; and many bad offices were done bewixt these two Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours by unfaithfull <note n="*" place="margin">

The citie of Philomela he made to sing a dolefull tune, rasing it to the ground, and executing all the people therein as rebells against the law of nations, for kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling his Embassadours: and so came with much difficulty and honour into Syria.</p>
               <p>Saladine shook for fear, hearing of his coming; and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the advice of <note n="*" place="margin">

For he feared if the Dutch wonne these places, they would not easily be driven out:
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:21984:67"/>
whereas now being naked from shelter, he would weary them with set battels, having men numberlesse, and those neare at hand; and so he would tame the Romane Eagle by watching him, giving him no rest nor respite from continuall fighting. It is therefore no Paradox to say, That in some case the strength of a kingdome doth consist in the weaknesse of it. And hence it is, that our English Kings have suffered Time, without dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbing her meals, to feed her belly full on their in-land castles and citie-walls; which whilest they were standing in their strength, were but the nurseries of rebellion.

               <p>But Frederick the Emperour, being now entring into the Holy land, was to the great grief of all Christians sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly taken away, being drowned in the river of Saleph; a river (such is the envie of Barbarisme obscuring all places) which cannot accurately be known at this day, because this new name is a stranger to all ancient maps. If he went in to wash himself, as some write, he neither consulted with his health nor honour: Some say, his horse foundred under him as he passed the water; others, that he fell from him. But these severall relations, as varietie of instruments, make a dolefull consort in this, that there he lost his life: and no wonder, if the cold water quickly quenched those few sparks of naturall heat left in him at seventie yeares of age. <note n="*" place="margin">

Let it content us to know that often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heaven blasteth those hopes which bud first and fairest; and the feet of mightie Monarchs do slip, when they want but one step to their enemies throne.</p>
               <p>After his death Frederick Duke of Suevia, his second sonne, undertook the conduct of the armie. Now the Turks conceiving grief had steeped and moistened these Pilgrimes hearts, gave them a sudden charge, in hope to have overthrown them. But the valiant Dutch, who though they had scarce wiped their eyes had scoured their swords, quickly forced them to retire.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Iune</hi> 21.</note> Then Frederick took the citie of Antioch, which was easily delivered unto him, and his hungrie souldiers well refreshed by the citizens, being as yet for the most part Christians. Marching from hence in set battel, he overthrew Dodequin Generall of Saladines forces, slew foure thousand,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:21984:68"/>
and took a thousand prisoners with little losse of his own men: and so came to the citie of Tyre, where he buried the corpse of his worthy father in the Cathedrall Church next the tombe of learned Origen; and Gulielmus Tyrius the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Archbishop preached his funerall sermon. We may heare his sorrowfull army speaking this his Epitaph unto him;
<q>
                     <l>Earth scarce did yeeld ground enough for thy sword</l>
                     <l>To conquer, how then could a brook afford</l>

               <p>From hence by sea they were conveyed to the Christian army before Ptolemais, where young Frederick died of the plague: and his great army which at first consisted of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fiftie thousand at their setting forth out of Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, had now no more left then <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>How many bloudie blows were here lent on both sides, and repayed with interest? what sallies? what assaults? what encounters? whilest the Christians lay betwixt Saladine with his great army behind them and the citie before them. One memorable battel we must not omit. It was agreed betwixt Saladine and the Christians to trie their fortunes in a pitched field: and now the Christians were in fair hope of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, when an <note n="*" place="margin">Fuga ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginario metu orta, <hi>Sabell.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:21984:68"/>
behold, Geoffrey Lusignan King Guy's brother (left for the guarding of the camp) marching out with his men, confuted the Christians in this their groundlesse mistake, and reinforced them to fight; whereby they wonne the day, though with the losse of two thousand men and Gerard Master of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plars.</p>
               <p>It was vainly hoped, that after this victorie the citie would be surrendred: but the Turks still bravely defended it, though most of their houses were burnt and beaten down, and the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie reduced to a bare <hi>sceleton</hi> of walls and towres. They fought as well with their wits as weapons, and both sides de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised strange defensive and offensive engines: so that Mars himself, had he been here present, might have learned to fight, and have taken notes from their practice. Mean time famine raged amongst the Christians; and though some provision was now and then brought in from Italy (for so farre they fetch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it) yet these small showres after great droughts parched the more, and rather raised then abated their hunger.</p>
               <p>Once more we will take our farewell of this siege for a twelve-moneth: But we must not forget that at this time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the walls of Ptolemais the Teutonick order, or <note n="*" place="margin">

For the King deputed William Bishop of Ely his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy; choosing him for that place rather then any lay-Earl, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a Coronet perchance may swell into a Crown, but never a Mitre: For a Clergie-mans calling made him unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of usurpation in his own person.</p>
               <p>Thus having settled matters at home, he set forth with many of our nation; which either ushered or followed him. Of these the prime were, Baldwine Archbishop of Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, Hubert Bishop of Salisburie, Robert Earl of Leicester, Ralph de Glanvile late chief Justice of England, Richard de

               <p>Yea, the interviews of equall Princes have ever been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served dangerous. Now Princes measure their equalitie not by the extent of their dominions, but by the absolutenesse of their power; so that he that is supreme and independent in his own countrey, counteth himself equall to any other Prince how great soever. Perchance some youthfull Kings may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sport and solace themselves one in anothers companie, whilest as yet pleasure is all the elevation of their souls: But when once they grow sensible of their own greatnesse, (a lesson they will quickly learn, and shall never want teachers) then emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation will be betwixt them: because at their meeting they cannot so go in equipage, but one will still be the foremost: Either his person will be more proper, or carriage more court-like, or attendance more accomplished, or attire more fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable, or some thing will either be or conceived to be more majesticall in one then the other: And corrivalls in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour count themselves eclipsed by every beam of state which shineth from their competitour.

At Messana in Sicilie these two Kings meet again: where to complete King Richards joy, behold his Navie there safely arriving, which with much difficultie and danger had fetched a compasse about Spain.</p>
               <p>And now King Richard by his own experience grew sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible of the miseries which merchants and mariners at sea underwent, being alwayes within few inches, often within an hairs breadth of death. Wherefore now touched with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morse of their pitifull case, he resolved to revoke the law of Wracks, as a law so just that it was even unjust. For former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly both in England and Normandie, the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bracton, lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</note> Crown was intituled to shipwrackt goods, and the King <hi>jure gentium</hi> made heir un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them; which otherwise <hi>jure naturali</hi> were conceived to be <hi>in bonis nullius,</hi> pertaining to no owner. But now our Richard refused to make advantage of such pitifull accidents, and to strip poore mariners out of those rags of their estates which the mercie and modestie of the waves and winds had left them. And therefore on the moneth of October, at Messana, in the presence of many Archbishops and Bishops, he for ever <note n="*" place="margin">Quietum clamavit <hi>Wreck,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Roger Hove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, in Rich.</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>pag.</hi> 678.</note> quitted the claim to Wracks: So that if any man out of the ship cometh alive to the shore, the propertie of the shipwrackt goods is still preserved to the owner. Yea, this grant was so enlarged by our succeeding Kings, that <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Tankred at this time was King of Sicilie; a bastard born: and no wonder, if climbing up to the throne the wrong way, he shaked when he sat down. Besides, he was a Tyrant; both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the dowrie and imprisoning the person of Joan wife to William late King of Sicilie, and sister to King Richard. But in what a case was he now, having two such mightie Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs come unto him! To keep them out, was above his power; to let them in, against his will. Well he knew it was wofull to lie in the rode where great armies were to passe: For power knoweth no inferiour friend; and the land-lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly loseth his rent, sometimes his land, where the tenant is too potent for him.</p>
               <p>At last he resolved (how wisely or honestly, let others judge) openly to poise himself indifferent betwixt these two
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:21984:70"/>
Kings, secretly applying himself to the French: which King Richard quickly discovered; as dissembling goeth not long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visible before a judicious eye.</p>
               <p>Mean time the citizens of Messana did the English much wrong, if not by the command<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the consent of the King. For though it be unjust to father the base actions of unrulie people on their Prince; yet Tankred not punishing his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for injuring the English, when he might and was required thereunto, did in effect justifie their insolencies, and adopt their deeds to be his. Wherefore King Richard to avenge himself, took Messana by assault, seised on most forts in the Island, demanding satisfaction for all wrongs done to him and his sister. Tankred though dull at first, now pricked with the sword, came off roundly with many thousand ounces of gold; and seeing, as the case stood, his best thrift was to be prodigall, gave to our King what rich conditions soever he demanded.</p>
               <p>Worse discords daily encreased betwixt the Kings of France and England; King Richard slighting the King of France his sister, whom he had promised to marrie, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing more affection to Beringaria daughter to the King of Navarre. Some Princes interposing themselves in this breach, rather asswaged the pain then removed the maladie: So dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous are ruptures betwixt great ones, whose affections per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance by the mediation of friends may be brought again to meet, but never to unite and incorporate. King Philip think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to forestall the market of honour, and take up all for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, hasted presently to Ptolemais: Richard followed at his leisure, and took Cyprus in his way. Isaac (or Cursac) reigned then in Cyprus; who, under Andronicus the Grecian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour (when every factious Noble-man snatched a plank out of that shipwracked Empire) seised on this Island, and there tyrannized as a reputed King. Some falsely conceive him a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan: and his faith is suspected, because his charitie was so bad; killing the English that landed there, not having so much man as to pitie a woman, and to suffer the sea-sick Lady Beringaria to come on shore. But King Richard speedily overran the Island, honoured Isaac with the magnificent captivitie of silver fetters; yet giving his daughter libertie and princely usage. The Island he pawned to the Templars for readie money. And because Cyprus by antiquitie was celebrated as the seat of Venus, that so it might prove to him, in the joyous moneth of May he solemnly took to wife his beloved Lady Berin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garia.</p>

               <p>WHilest King Richard stayed in Cyprus,<note place="margin">1191</note> the siege of Ptolemais went on: and though the French King thought with a running pull to bear the citie away, yet he found it staked down too fast for all his strength to stirre.</p>
               <p>Mean time, the plague and famine raged in the Christians camp; which the last yeare swept away fiftie Princes and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of note: Who, no doubt, went hence to a happie place; though it was before Pope Clement the sixth <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>This mortalitie notwithstanding, the siege still continued. And now the Christians and Turks, like two fensers long play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, were so well acquainted with the blows and guards each of other, that what advantage was taken betwixt them was merely casuall, never for want of skill, care, or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour on either side. It helped the Christians not a little, that a concealed Christian within the citie, with letters unsub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed with any name, gave them constant and faithfull intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of the remarkable passages amongst the Turks.</p>
               <p>No Prince in this siege deserved more then Leopoldus Duke of Austria; who fought so long in assaulting this citie, till his armour was all over gore bloud, save the place covered with his belt. <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>By this time King Richard was arrived (taking as he came a dromond,<note place="margin">

               <p>The houses which were left, with the spoil and prisoners, were equally divided betwixt Philip and Richard. Whereat many Noble-men, partners in the pains, no sharers in the gains,

Hereupon it was commanded that none hereafter should be baptized against their wills.</p>
               <p>Here the English cast down the ensignes of Leopoldus Duke of Austria, which he had advanced in a principall towre in Ptolemais; and as some say, threw them into the jakes. The Duke, though angrie at heart, forgot this injurie till he could remember it with advantage; and afterwards made King Richard pay soundly for this affront. It is not good to exasperate any, though farre inferiour: for, as the fable telleth us, the beetle may annoy the eagle, and the mouse befriend the lion.</p>
               <p>When the citie was taken, it grieved the Christians not a little that their faithfull <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Hoveden, in Rich.</hi> 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. <hi>pag.</hi> 694.</note> correspondent, who advised them by his letters, could no where be found: Pitie it was that Rahabs red lace was not tied at his window. But indeed it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he was dead before the surrendring of the citie. Greater was the grief that the Crosse did no where appear, either carelessely lost, or enviously concealed by the Turks. Whilest the Christians stormed hereat, Saladine required a longer respite for the performance of the conditions. But King Richard would not enlarge him from the strictnesse of what was concluded; conceiving this was in effect to forfeit the victorie back again. Besides, he knew he did it onely to gain time to fetch new breath: and if he yeelded to him, his boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had not been thanked, but his fear upbraided, as if he durst not denie him. Yea, in anger King Richard commanded all the Turkish captives which were in his hands, <note n="*" place="margin">

For which fact he suffered much in his repute, branded with rashnesse and crueltie, as the murderer of many Christians: For Saladine in revenge put as many of our captives to death. On the other side the moderation of the French King was much commended, who reserving his prisoners alive, exchanged them to ransome so many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians.</p>

               <p>MEan time the Christians were rent a sunder with faction: Philip the French King, Odo Duke of Burgundie, Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pold Duke of Austria, most of the Dutch, all the Genoans and Templars siding with King Conrade; King Richard, Henry Count of Champaigne, the Hospitallers, Venetians, and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sans taking part with King Guy.

               <p>All would not do, Philip persisted in his old plea, How the life of him absent would be more advantageous to the cause, then the death of him present; and by importunitie got leave to depart, solemnly swearing not to molest the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands dominions.</p>
               <p>Thus the King of France returned in person, but remained still behind in his instructions, which he left (with his armie) to the Duke of Burgundie; to whom he prescribed both his path and his pace, where and how he should go. And that Duke moved slowly, having no desire to advance the work where King Richard would carrie all the honour. For in those acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons wherein severall undertakers are compounded together, commonly the first figure for matter of credit maketh ciphres of all the rest.

               <p>COnrade being killed and Guy gone away, Henry Earl of Champaigne was chosen King of Jerusalem by the especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all procuring of King Richard his uncle. To corroborate his election by some right of succession, he married Isabella, the widow of King Conrade and daughter to Almerick King of Jerusalem. A Prince (as writers report) having a sufficient stock of valour in himself, but little happie in expressing it; whether for want of opportunitie, or shortnesse of his reigne, being most spent in a truce. He more pleased himself in the style of Prince of Tyre then King of Jerusalem; as counting it more honour to be Prince of what he had, then King of what he had not.</p>
               <p>And now the Christians began every where to build: The Templars fortified Gaza; King Richard repaired and walled Ptolemais, Porphyria, Joppa, and Askelon. But alas! this short prosperity, like an Autumne-spring, came too late and was gone too soon to bring any fruit to maturitie.</p>

                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:21984:73" rendition="simple:additions"/>It was now determined they should march towards Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem: for all this while they had but hit the butt; that Holy ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie was the mark they shot at. Richard led the vantguard of English; Duke Odo commanded in the main battel over his French; James of Avergne brought on the Flemings and Brabanters in the rere. Saladine, serpent-like biting the heel, assaulted the rere, not farre from Bethlehem; when the French and English wheeling about, charged the Turks most furious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Emulation, formerly poyson, was here a cordiall, each Christian nation striving not onely to conquer their enemies, but to overcome their friends in the honour of the conquest. King Richard seeking to put his courage out of doubt, brought his judgement into question, being more prodigall of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son then beseemed a Generall.

The Christians got the victory, without the losse of any of number or note, save James of Avergne, who here died in the bed of honour: But more of the Turks wore slain then in any battel for fourtie yeares before.</p>
               <p>Had the Christians presently gone to Jerusalem, probably they might have surprised it, whilest the Turks eyes were muffled and blindfolded in the amazement of this great over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw.

               <head>Chap. 12. The little-honourable peace King Richard made with Saladine; Of the value of Reliques.</head>
               <p>BUt bad news out of Europe shaked his steadiest resolutions, hearing how William Bishop of Ely, his Vice-roy in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, used unsufferable insolencies over his subjects: So hard it is for one of base parentage to personate a King without over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting his part. Also he heard how the King of France and John Earl of Morton his own brother, invaded his dominions; ambition, the Pope in their belly, dispensing with their oath to the contrary. Besides, he saw this warre was not a subject ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of valour to any purpose; the Venetians, Genoans, Pisans and Florentines being gone away with their fleets, wisely shrinking themselves out of the collar, when they found their necks wrung with the hard imployment. Hereupon he was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced first to make the motion of (in plain terms, to begge) peace of Saladine.</p>
               <p>Let Saladine now alone to winne, having all the game in his own hand. Well knew he how to shoot at his own ends, and to take aim by the exigencies wherein he knew King Richard was plunged. For he had those cunning gypsies about him, who could read in King Richards face what grieved his heart; and by his intelligencers was certified of every note-worthy pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage in the English armie. Upon these terms therefore or none (beggers of peace shall never be choosers of their conditions) a truce for three (some say, five) yeares might be concluded, That the Christians should demolish all places they had walled since the taking of Ptolemais; which was in effect to undo what with much charge they had done. But such was the tyrannie of King Richards occasions, forcing him to return, that he was glad to embrace those conditions he hated at his heart.</p>
               <p>Thus the voyage of these two Kings, begun with as great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the undertakers as expectation of the beholders, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued with as much courage as interchangeablenesse of suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse, baned with mutuall discord &amp; emulation, was ended with some honour to the undertakers, no <note n="*" place="margin">

Some farre-fetched deare-bought honour they got; especially King Richard, who eternized his memory in Asia: whom if men forget, horses will remember; the Turks
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:21984:74"/>
using to say to their horses when they started for fear, Dost thou think King Richard is here? Profit they got none, losing both of them the hair of their heads in an acute disease; which was more, saith <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>They left the Christians in Syria in worse case then they found them: as he doeth the benighted traveller a discourtesie rather then a kindnesse, who lendeth him a lantern to take it away, leaving him more masked then he was before.</p>
               <p>And now a little to solace my self and the reader with a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry digression, after much sorrow and sad stories; King Richard did one thing in Palestine which was worth all the cost and pains of his journey, namely, He redeemed from the Turks a chest full of holy Reliques (which they had gotten at the taking of Jerusalem) so great, as <note n="*" place="margin">

And though some know no more then Esops cock how to prize these pearls, let them learn the true value of them from the Romane jewellers.

               <p>He disguised himself to be one Hugo a merchant, whose one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly commodity was himself, whereof he made but a bad bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain.

Yet all the weight of their cruelty did not bow him beneath a Princely carriage.</p>
               <p>Leopoldus Duke of Austria hearing hereof, as being Lord of the soil,<note place="margin">

               <p>SOon after,<note place="margin">1193</note> Saladine the terrour of the East ended his life, having reigned sixteen yeares.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Febr.</hi> 16.</note> Consider him as a man, or a Prince, he was both wayes admirable.</p>
               <p>Many Historians (like some painters, which rather shew their skill in drawing a curious face then in making it like to him whom it should resemble) describe Princes rather what they should be then what they were; not shewing so much their goodnesse as their own wits. But finding this Saladine so gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally commended of all writers, we have no cause to distrust this his true character.</p>
               <p>His wisdome was great, in that he was able to advise; and greater, in that he was willing to be advised: Never so wedded to his own resolves, but on good ground he would be divorced from them. His valour was not over-free, but would well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer the spurre when need required. In his victories he was much beholden to the advantage of season, place, and number; and seldome wrested the garland of honour from an arm as strong as his own. He ever marched in person into the field, remembring that his predecessours, the Caliphs of Egypt, brake themselves by using Factours, and imploying of Souldans. His temperance was great, diet sparing, sleep moderate, not to pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per nature, but keep it in repair. His greatest recreation was va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety and exchange of work. Pleasures he rather sipped then drank off; sometimes, more to content others then please him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self. Wives he might have kept sans number, but stinted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to one or two; using them rather for posterity then wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnesse. His justice to his own people was remarkable; his promise with his enemies generally well kept. Much he did tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph in mercy: Fierce in fighting, mild in conquering; and having his enemies in his hand, pleased himself more in the power then act of revenge. His liberality would have drained his treasure, had it not had a great and quick spring, those Eastern parts being very rich. Serviceable men he would pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase on any rate; and sometimes his gifts bare better propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his own greatnesse then the receivers deserts. Vast bribes he would give to have places betrayed unto him, and often effected that with his gold which he could not do with his steel. Zealous he was in his own religion, yet not violent against Christians <hi>quà</hi> Christians. Scholarship cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected

in him who was a Turk by his birth (amongst whom it is a sinne to be learned) and a souldier by breeding. His humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was admirable; as being neither ignorant of his greatnesse, nor over-knowing it. He provided to have no solemnities at his funerals; and ordered that before his corpse a black cloth should be carried on the top of a spear, and this proclaimed, <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>AFter his death, Almerick Lusignan, brother to King Guy, was in the right of his wife crowned King of Jerusalem: For he married Isabella the Relict of Henry the last King. This Lady was foure times married: first, to Humphred Prince of Thorone; then to the three successive Kings of Jerusalem, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade, Henry, and this Almerick. He was also King of Cyprus; and the Christians in Syria promised themselves much aid from the vicinity of that Island. But though he was neare to them, he was farre from helping them, making pleasure all his work; being an idle, lazy, worthlesse Prince. But I trespasse on that politick rule, Of Princes we must speak the best, or the least; if that be not intended, when the truth is so late that danger is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed upon it.</p>
               <p>In his time, Henry Emperour of Germany, indicted by his conscience for his cruelty against King Richard, seeking to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume his name in the nostrils of the world, which began to be unfavourie, set on foot another voyage to the Holy land. Pope Celestine the third sent his Legates about to promote this ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,<note place="margin">1197</note> shewing how God himself had sounded the alarm by the dissension of the Turks: Jerusalem now might be wonne with the blows of her enemies; onely an army must be sent, not so much to conquer as to receive it. Generall of the Pilgrimes was Henry Duke of Saxony; next him, Frederick Duke of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria, Herman Landtgrave of Thuringia, Henry Palatine of Rhene, Conrade Archbishop of Mentz, Conrade Archbishop of Wirtzburg, the Bishops of Breme, Halberstadt, &amp; Regenspurg, with many more Prelates; so that here was an Episcopall ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, which might have served for a nationall Synod: Insomuch that one truly might here have seen the Church Militant. We have no ambition, saith <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Some of these souldiers were imployed by Henry the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour (who knew well to bake his cake with the Churches feuel) to subdue his rebells in Apulia. This done, they passed through Grecia, and found there better entertainment then some of their predecessours. Hence by shipping they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into Syria: Here they brake the <note n="*" place="margin">

The citie Berytus they quickly wanne, and as quickly lost. For Henry the Emperour suddenly died, the root which nourished this voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and then the branches withered. Henry also Duke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xony, Generall of this army, was slain. And Conrade Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of Mentz, one of the Electours, would needs return home to the choice of a new Emperour; knowing he could more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably use his voice in Germany then his arms in Syria.

               <p>The rest that remained fortified themselves in Joppa. And now the feast of S. Martin was come, the Dutch their Arch-Saint. This man being a Germane by birth, and Bishop of Tours in France, was eminent for his <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>THis truce notwithstanding, another armie of Pilgrimes was presently provided for Syria: The Tetrarchs whereof were Baldwine Earl of Flanders, Dandalo the Venetian Duke, Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald Earl of Champaigne, Boniface Marquesse of Montferrat, with many other Nobles.</p>
               <p>Leave we them a while taking the citie of Jadera in Istria for the Venetians. Mean time if we look over into Greece, we shall find Isaac Angelus the Emperour deposed, thrust into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, his eyes put out (the punishment there in fashion) so that he ended his dayes before he ended his life, by the cruelty of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexius Angelus his brother, who succeeded him.</p>
               <p>But young Alexius, Isaac Angelus his sonne, with some Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Noble-men, came to the courts of most Western Princes to beg assistance to free his father and expell the tyrant. He so deported himself, that each gesture was a net to catch mens good will; not seeking their favour by losing himself, but though he did bow, he would not kneel: so that in his face one might reade a pretty combat betwixt the beams of majesty and cloud of adversity. To see a Prince in want, would move a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sers charity. Our Western Princes tendered his case, which they counted might be their own; their best right lying at the mercy of any stronger usurper. Young Alexius so dressed his meat, that he pleased every mans palate; promising for their succours to disingage the French from their debts to the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian; promising the Venetian satisfaction for the wrongs done them by the Grecians; and bearing the Pope in hand he would reduce the Eastern Churches into his subjection: things which he was little <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Nicetas.</hi>
                  </note> able to perform. But well may the statute of Bankrupt be sued out against him who cannot be rich in promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. These his fair proffers prevailed so farre, that the Pope commanded, and other Princes consented, that this army of Pilgrimes levied for the Holy land, should be imployed against the usurping Grecian Emperour. Many taxed his Holinesse for an unjust steward of the Christian forces, to expend them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Grecians, which were to be laid out against the Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels: Especially now when Palestine, through the dissension of the Turks, offered itself into the Christians arms to be regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Others thought the Pope took the right method; because
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:21984:78"/>
he which should winne Jerusalem must begin at Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople: And by this warre the Grecian Empire, which was the bridge to Syria, would be made good, and secured for the pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage of Pilgrimes. The souldiers generally rejoyced at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of their service: for the barren warres in Syria starved the undertakers; and a cook himself cannot lick his fingers where no meat is dressed. There nothing but naked honour was to be gotten, here honour clothed with spoil; the usurpers treasure would make brave scrambling amongst them: And it was good plowing up of that ground which had long lien fallow.</p>

Which brittle honour of theirs was quickly broken: For soon after the father died, being brought into an open place, kept before in a close pent dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon; and having long fasted from good aire, he now got his death by surfeting on it. His sonne was villainously strangled by Alexius Ducas, called from his beetle-brow Mursiphlus: One of base parentage, who was tumultuously chosen Emperour by the people. This Ducas offered some affronts to the Latines which lay before Constantinople in their ships. Wherefore, and also because they were not payed for their former service, they the second time assaulted the citie,<note place="margin">1204</note> and took it by main force;<note place="margin">

It was now expected that they should have advanced hence into Palestine: But here having well feathered their nests, they were loth to flie any further.

               <p>POpe Innocent the third having lately learned the trick of imploying the armie of Pilgrimes in by-services,<note place="margin">1206</note> began now to set up a trade thereof. For two yeares after he levied a great number of them, whom he sent against the Albingenses in France. These were reputed hereticks, whom his Holinesse in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to root out with all crueltie; that good shepherd know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no other way to bring home a wandring sheep then by worrying him to death. He fully and freely promised the undertakers the self-same Pardons and Indulgences as he did to those who went to conquer the Holy land; and very conscio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably requested their aid onely for fourty dayes, hoping to chop up these Albingenses at a bit. Though herein he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and they stuck in his and his successours teeth for fifty yeares together. The place being nearer, the service shorter, the work lesse, the wages the same with the voyage into Syria, many entred themselves in this imployment, and neglected the other.</p>
               <p>We will trace this armie by their footsteps, and our penne

must wait on their swords. And I hope that his Holinesse, who absolved many of their vows from Palestine, and commuted them into a journey into France, will also of his goodnesse dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense with my veniall digression herein, in prosecuting their actions. Yea, indeed, I need not his dispensation, being still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident on my own subject, this also being styled, The Holy warre, The warre for the Crucifix, The army of the Church; the souldiers also bearing the badge of the Crosse on their coat-armour.</p>
               <p>But first let us throughly examine what these Albingenses were, and what they held: a question that will quit the cost in studying it.</p>
               <p>They were a younger house of the Waldenses, and branched from them; not different in doctrine, but later in time, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant in place: so called from the countrey Albigeois in France, where they lived.</p>
               <p>I find three grand different opinions of Authours concerning them:
<list>
                     <item>First, Some make them to have been very monsters in life and doctrine; so that the heaviest punishment was too light for them. And this is the generall voyce of most writers in that age, and all Romanists in our dayes.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, Others clean contrary hold, That these Walden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses (for I make them and the Albingenses <hi>synonyma,</hi> as <note n="*" place="margin">

These alone were Gods Virgins, his Witnesses in sackcloth, his Woman in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, his sealed ones, his seven thousand whose knees were not suppled with the Baalisme of that age. This is the expresse opinion of some strict Protestants; and of some who speak it not out, yet mutter it to themselves.</item>

They conceive that the maintainers hereof engage themselves in a labyrinth of difficulties, hanging too great a weight on so slender a string, in making such an handfull of men the onely Church for so long continuance. More moderately therefore they hold, That these Albingenses were a purer part of the Church; and though guilty of some errours (as there must be a dawning before the day) and charged with more, yet they maintained the same <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>ABout the yeare 1160, Peter Waldo a merchant of Lyons, rich in substance and learning (for a lay-man) was walking and talking with his friends, when one of them suddenly fell down dead. Which lively spectacle of mans mortality so im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed the soul of this Waldo, that instantly he resolved on a strict reformation of his life: Which to his power he perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; translating some books of the Bible; instructing such as resorted to him in godlinesse of life; teaching withall, That Purgatorie, Masses, dedication of Temples, worshipping of Saints, prayers for the dead, were inventions of the devil, and snares of avarice; That Monkery was a stinking carrion, the Church of Rome the whore of Babylon, the Pope that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ Paramount: He sharply lanced the vitious ulcers of Clergie-mens lives, reproving their pride and luxury. Soon got he many followers, both because novelty is a forcible load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, and because he plentifully relieved his poore disciples; and those that use that trade shall never want custome.</p>
               <p>The Archbishop of Lyons hearing such doctrines broched as were high treason against the Triple crown, ferreted Waldo and his sectaries out of Lyons and the countrey thereabouts. But persecution is the bellows of their Gospel, to blow every spark into a flame. This their division proved their multiplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Some fled into the Alpes, living there on so steep hills, and in so deep holes, that their enemies were afraid to climbe or dive after them. Here they had the constant company of the snow: And as it by the height of the hills was protected from the sun-beams, so they from the scorching of persecution, even to Luthers time. Others fled into Picardy, Flanders, England, Alsatia, Bohemia, <note n="*" place="margin">

Many of them were cruelly massacred, five and thirty Burgesses of Mayence burned at Bingen in one fire, eighteen at Mayence, fourescore at Strassburg at the instance of the Bishop thereof. But Martyrs ashes are the best compost to manure the Church: for others were wonne to their opinion, by beholding their constancie and patience. Strange that any should fall in love with that profession, whose professours were so miserable! But truth hath alwayes a good face, though often but bad clothes.</p>
               <p>They were called by sundry names; Sometimes from the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where they lived: As from Albigeois, Tholose, Lyons, Picardy, Bohemia; Albingenses, Tholousians, Lyonists, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cards, Bohemians.

               <p>They had also nick-names; called, First, Poore men of Ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: not because they chose to be poore, but could not choose but be poore, being stripped out of all their goods: And why should the Friars glory be this peoples shame? they mocking at poverty in others, which they count meritorious in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves.

Thirdly, Turlupins; that is, Dwellers with wolves, (and yet might they be Gods sheep) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forced to flee into woods. Fourthly, likewise they were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Sicars; that is, Cut-purses. Fifthly, <hi>Fraterculi</hi>; that is, Shift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Sixthly, <hi>Insabbatha</hi>; that is, Observers of no sabbath. Seventhly, Pasagenes; that is, Wanderers. As also Arians, Manicheans, Adamites (how justly will appear afterwards.) Yea, scarce was there an arrow in all the quiver of malice which was not shot at them.</p>

               <head>Chap. 20. The Albingenses their answer, confessing some, denying most crimes laid to their charge; Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations their adversaries give them.</head>
               <p>COme we now to the full and foul indictment wherewith these Albingenses are charged: That they gave no reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Reinerius, fol.</hi> 22. <hi>art.</hi> 32.</note> holy places; rejected the baptisme of infants; held that temporall power was grounded in grace; that it was a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious work to persecute the Priests of Rome and their sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: With the Adamites they went naked (an affront to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;) with the Manicheans they made two first causes, God of good, the devil of evil; held community of all things, even of wives amongst them; were <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Claudius Rubis, History of Lyons, pag.</hi> 269.</note> sorcerers and conjurers (pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to command the devil, when they most obeyed him) guilty of incest, buggery, and more unnaturall sinnes, whereby men (as it were) runne backward to hell.</p>
               <p>No whit affrighted with this terrible accusation, many late writers dare be their advocates to defend them, though confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them guilty of some of these, but not in so high and hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous a manner as they are accused.</p>
               <p>True it is, because most in that age ranne riot in adoring of Churches (as if some inherent sanctity was cieled to their roof, or plaistered to their walls; yea, such as might more ingratiate with God the persons and prayers of people there assembled) the Waldenses (out of that old errour not yet worn out, That the best way to straighten what is crooked, is to over-bow it) denied Churches that relative holinesse and fit reverence due unto them. Baptisme of infants they refused not (though <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> S. Bernard, taking it rather from the rebound then first rise, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them therewith) but onely deferred it till it might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred by one of their own Ministers; their tender consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences not digesting the Popish baptisme, where clear water by Gods ordinance, was by mans additions made a salve or plaister. That dominion was founded in grace, seemeth to be their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry opinion: Yea, it hangeth as yet in the Schools on the file, and is not taken off, as a thing disputable, finding many favourers. But grant it a great errour (for wicked men shall be arraigned before God, not as usurpers, but as tyrants; not for not having right, but not right using the creatures) yet herein they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not so farre as the Papists now-a-dayes, to unthrone and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose excommunicated Princes: So that they who do most, have least cause to accuse them. That they spoke too homely
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:21984:81" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and coursely of the Romish Priests, inveighing too bitterly and uncharitably against them, condemning all for some, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance be proved: And no wonder if they spake ill of those from whom they felt ill. But take their speeches herein, as the words of men upon the rack, forced from them by the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie of cruel usage.</p>
               <p>In these errours the Albingenses hope to find favour, if men consider, First, the ignorance of the age they lived in: It is no news to stumble in the dark. Secondly, the frailty (that squire of the body) attending on mans nature; yea, he shall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall who liveth till he be stoned by one without fault. Thirdly, the errours themselves, which are rather in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limbes then vitalls of religion. And it may be conceived they might have been reclaimed, if used with gentle means, not cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chized with fire and fagot; it being a true rule, That mens con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences are more moved with leading then dragging or drawing.</p>
               <p>But the sting of the indictment is still behind in the tail or end thereof; charging them with such hainous errours in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, and vices in life: All which the patrones for the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants <note n="*" place="margin">

Waldo and the rest, for ought we know, and I beleeve (set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting malice aside) for ought you know, were godly men. Their great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est errour was that they complained of the disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious lives of the Clergie.</note> deny and defie, as coined out of the mint of their enemies malice.</p>
               <p>It will be objected, If denying the fact might serve the turn, we should have no malefactours: This therefore is but a poore plea, barely to deny, when that such clouds of witnesses are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them. And grant they have a few straggling writers, or some sleeping records which may seem to acquit them, what are one or two men (though suppose them giants) against a whole army?</p>
               <p>To this I find it answered for the Albingenses, That it hath been the constant practice of the Romish writers, alwayes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame those that differ from them, especially if they handle too roughly the <hi>Noli me tangere</hi> of the Popes supremacie.

                  </note> Bolsecus laid on Luther and Calvine? Now how fearlesse will they be to steal at midnight, who dare thus rob men of their good name at noon-day?

               <p>Secondly, I find they produce the authenticall copies (such as are above their enemies calumnies) of the Catechismes, Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, Remonstrances of these Albingenses; wherein the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled doctrine of the Protestants is delivered free from

Manicheisme, or any other heresie fathered upon them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, their enemies slanders plainly appear in some parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; which justly shaketh the credit of the whole accusation. For whereas they are charged with the Adamites willingly to have gone naked, we find them rather <hi>nudati</hi> then <hi>nudi,</hi> forced thereunto by the Popes Legate: Who being about to take the city of Carcassone in France, where these people most swarmed, he would not grant them their lives but on this condition, That both males and females should go forth, and passe by his army <note n="*" place="margin">

Argued it not a very foul stomach in him who could feed his eyes with contentment on such a sight, which otherwise would more deeply have wounded the mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty of the beholder then of the doers, who did it by compulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? See now how justly these innocents are charged! As well may the Israelites be blamed for cruelty to themselves, in put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out their own eyes, when they were commanded to do it by the mercilesse Ammonite.</p>
               <p>Lastly, they are cleared by the testimonies of their very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and who knoweth not, but such a witnesse is equivalent to a generall consent? For those, who, when bemadded with anger, most rave and rage against them, yet <hi>per lucida intervalla,</hi> in their cold bloud, when their words are indicted from their judgements not passions, do most sufficiently acquit them from these accusations.</p>
               <p>Reinerius, a Jacobine Monk, and a cruel inquisitour of the Waldenses, testified, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Cited by Fox in his Maetyrol. pag.</hi> 232.</note> That they lived justly before men, and beleeved all things well of God, and held all the articles con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Creed; onely they blasphemed the Romish Church, and hated it.</p>
               <p>Claudius de Seissell Archbishop of Turin confesseth, As touching their life and manners they were sound and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveable, without scandal amongst men, giving themselves (to their power) to the observation of the commandments of God.</p>
               <p>King Lewis the twelfth of France being throughly inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the faith and life of the Waldenses in his time, bound it with an oath, That they were better men then he or his people.

               <p>POpe Innocent the third having now gathered together an armie of one hundred thousand Pilgrimes, set forwards for the finall exstirpation of the poore Albingenses. The best cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions for his Holinesse herein, were the Duke of Burgundy, the Earls of Nevers, S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Paul, Auxerre, Geneva, Poictiers, with Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Earl of Montfort; Of the Clergie, Milo the Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate, the Archbishops of Sens, Rovan; the Bishops of Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, Nevers, Lysieux, Bayeux, Chartres, with divers others; every Bishop with the Pilgrimes of his jurisdiction: To whom the Pope promised Paradise in heaven, but not one peny on earth. Their work was to destroy the Albingenses, which were in great numbers in Daulphine, Provence, Narbonne, Tholose, and other parts of France. Their Commission also extended to the rooting out of all their friends and favourers, whether
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:21984:83"/>
detected, or onely suspected; such as were Reimund Earl of Tholose, Reimund Earl of Foyx, the Vicecount of Besiers, Gaston Lord of Berne, the Earl of Bigorre, the Lady of la Vaur, with divers others. See here a new gate to heaven never opened before, for men to cut their way thither through the throats of their innocent brethren! Behold the holy Ghost, who once came down in the form of a Dove, now counterfeited in the shape of a Vulture!</p>
               <p>But we must not forget how just before the warre began, the Pope pretended to reclaim them by reasons to the Church of Rome: To which end he gave order for a disputation with them. The parties, place, and time were agreed on; who, where, when they should dispute: but <hi>in fine</hi> nothing was ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. Yea, who ever knew conferences in so great oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ripen kindly, and bring any fruit to perfection? For many come rather for faction then satisfaction, resolving to carry home the same opinions they brought with them: An upright moderatour will scarce be found, who hangeth not to one side: The place will be subject to suspicion, and hinder liberty: Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and readinesse of speech with the most (though not most judicious) auditours will bear away the bell from solidity of arguments: The passages in the disputing will be partially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and both sides will brag of the conquest; so that the rent will be made worse, and more spirits conjured up then allayed.</p>
               <p>But now words ended in blows; the Pope onely entertaining them in <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>The first piece of service his souldiers performed, was in sacking the citie of Besiers, and burrough of Carcassone: In which many Catholicks, stedfast in the Romish faith, did dwell, and promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scuously were slain with the Albingenses; yea, Priests them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were cut in pieces in their priestly ornaments, and under the banner of the Crosse: So that the swallowing of their foes made their friends also go down glib through their throats, without danger of choking. As for the city of Carcassone, which was not farre from the burrough; to the inhabitants thereof those immodest conditions were propounded, whereof former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: which they refused; and God better provided for them: For whilest the citie was besieged, they escaped out by the benefit of a vault under ground, and so shifted abroad for themselves.</p>

               <head>Chap. 22. Simon Earl of Montfort chosen Captain of the Holy warre; He conquereth the King of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon, prevaileth against the Albingenses, and at last is killed by a woman.</head>
               <p>HItherto this warre was managed by the Popes Legate:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of this following slo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in Io. Paul Perin. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. <hi>&amp; deinceps.</hi>
                  </note> But now it was concluded that a secular captain should be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned to him, in whose person the chief command should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side over Martiall affairs; and for his pains, by the Popes do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he was to enjoy all countreys that should be conquered from the Albingenses or their favourers. The place was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Duke of Burgundy; who refused it, saying, He had lands and Lordships enow of his own, without spoiling others of their goods. It was waved also by the Earls of S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>-Paul, and Nevers, whether out of conscience or policie; because though the Pope gave them the bears skinne, they must first kill and slay him themselves.<note place="margin">1210.</note> At last Simon of Montfort, nigh Paris, accepted of it, swearing to vex the Lords enemies. And for a breakfast to begin with, he was seised of the Vicecounty of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siers, proceeding from hence to take many castles and cities.</p>
               <p>One grand inconvenience attended on this armie of Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes: For when their quarantine, or fourty dayes service, was expired (the term the Pope set them to merit Paradise in) they would not stay one whit longer: Like post-horses they would runne to their set stage, but could not be spurred one foot further; contenting themselves they had already purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed heaven, and fearing they should be put in possession thereof too soon, by losing their lives in that service. And though the Bishops perswaded some few to stay, that so the surplusage of their merits might make up the arrerages of their friends which wanted them, yet could they not prevail to any purpose. Nor could they so cast and contrive their matters, the tide of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples devotion being uncertain, but that betwixt the going out of the old and coming in of the new store of Pilgrimes, there would be a low ebbe, wherein their armie was almost wasted to nothing: whereof the Albingenses made no small advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
               <p>However, the Earls of Tholose, Foyx, and Comminge, and Prince of Berne, the patrones of the Albingenses, finding they were too weak for this Holy armie, sheltered themselves under Peter King of Aragon; whose homagers they were, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:21984:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
investiture from him, though their dominions lay on this side of the Pyrenean hills. This King had the greatnesse of the Earl of Montfort in suspicion; fearing lest these severall Principalities, which now were single arrows, should be bound in one sheaf, conquered and united under Earl Simon. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he fomented a faction in them against the Holy armie; publickly protesting against the proceedings of Earl Simon; charging him to have turned the bark of Gods Church into a pirates ship, robbing others and enriching themselves under the pretense of Religion, seising on the lands of good Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks for supposed hereticks, using Gods cause as hunters do a stand, in it the more covertly to shoot at what game they please: Otherwise, why was the Vicecount of Beziers, who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and died firm in the Romish faith, lately trained into the Legates hand, and against oathes and promises of his safe return, kept close prisoner till his death, and his lands seised on by Earl Simon?</p>
               <p>At last the King of Aragon taking the Earl of Montfort on the advantage (shooting him as it were betwixt wind and water, the ending of the old and beginning of new Pilgrimes) forced him to a battel. The King had thirty thousand foot and seven thousand horse; but the Earl, of both foot and horse not above two thousand two hundred. They closed together neare the castle of Moret: And the King, whether out of zeal of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest and thirst of honour, or distrust of under-officers, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to animate others, or a mixture of all, ranne his curvets so openly, and made his turns and returns in the head of the army, that so fair a mark invited his enemies arrows to hit him; by whom he was wounded to death, and fell from his horse; to lesson all Generals to keep themselves, like the heart, in the body of the army, whence they may have a virtuall omnipresence in every part thereof; and not to expose their persons (which, like crystall viols, contain the extracted spirits of their souldiers spilled with their breaking) to places of imminent danger. With his bodie fell the hearts of his men:<note place="margin">1212.</note> And though the Earls of Tholose, Foyx, and Comminge, perswaded, entreated, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them to stay, they used their oratorie so long till their audience ranne all away, and they were fain to follow them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving themselves by flight to redeem their honour some other time.</p>
               <p>Simon improving this victorie, pursued them to the gates of Tholose, and killed many thousands. The Friars imputed this victory to the Bishops benediction, and adoring a piece of the Crosse, together with the fervency of the Clergies prayers, which remaining behind in the castle of Moret, batter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed heaven with their importunity. On the other side, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bingenses
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:21984:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
acknowledged Gods justice in punishing the proud King of Aragon; who, as if his arm had been strong and long enough to pluck down the victory out of heaven without Gods reaching it to him, conceived that Earl Simon came rather to cast himself down at his feet then to fight. But such reckonings without the host are ever subject to a rere-account.</p>
               <p>Yet within few yeares the face of this warre began to alter: (With writers of short-hand we must set a prick for a letter, a letter for a word, marking onely the most remarkables.) For young Reimund Earl of Tholose, exceeding his father in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour and successe, so bestirred himself, that in few moneths he regained what Earl Simon was many yeares in getting: And at last Earl Simon besieging Tholose,<note place="margin">1118</note> with a stone which a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man let flie out of an engine, had his head parted from his body.</p>
               <p>Men use not to be niggards of their censures on strange acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: Some paralleled his life with Abimelech that tyrant-Judge; who with the bramble (fitter to make a fire then a King of) accepted of the woodden Monarchie, when the vine, olive, figge-tree declined it. They paired them also in their ends, death disdaining to send his summons by a masculine hand, but arresting them both by a woman. Some perswaded themselves they saw Gods finger in the womans hand; that because the greater part of his cruelty lighted on the weaker sex (for he had buried the Lady of laVaur alive, respecting neither her sex nor nobility) a woman was chosen out to be his executioner: though of himself he was not so prone to cruelty, but had those at his elbow which prompted him to it. The time of his death was a large field for the conceits of others to walk in; because even then when the Pope and three Councels, of Vaur, Montpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier, and Laterane, had pronounced him sonne, servant, favourite of the faith, the invincible defender thereof: And must he not needs break, being swoln with so many windie titles?

               <p>Soon after began the Laterane Councel under Innocent the third:<note place="margin">1215</note> Wherein many things were concluded for the recovery of the Holy land; as, That the Crosse should every where be preached with zeal and earnestnesse to procure Pilgrimes; That all <note n="*" place="margin">

Cent.</hi> 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 9.</note> tiltings in Christendome for three yeares should be forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, that so the spears of Christians might onely be broken against Infidels; That Clergie-men that went this voyage might (if need were) mortgage their Church-livings for three yeares to provide themselves with present necessaries, That all debters, during their Pilgrimage (though bound by oath in conscience, the strongest specialty) should be dispensed with to pay no use to their creditours; who if Christians, by excommunications; if Jews, were to be forced by the secular power to remit their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest; That all Priests should contribute the twentieth part of their revenues for three yeares, to advance this designe. And lest (saith his Holinesse) we should seem to lay heavy burdens on others which we will not touch with our least finger, we as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signe a ship at our own cost to carry our Pilgrimes of the citie of Rome; and disburse for the present what can be spared from our necessary expenses, to the summe of thirty thousand pounds, to further the project: and for three yeares to come, we and our brethren the Cardinals of Rome, will fully pay the tenth of our Church-profits.</p>
               <p>Hereupon next spring a numerous armie set forward to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine,<note place="margin">1216</note> conducted by Pelagius the Popes Legate, Andrew King of Hungarie (who having washed himself in the river of Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, would stay no longer, but instantly returned home) the three Electorall Archbishops, with those of Liege, Wirtzburg, Bamberg, Strassburg, Paris, &amp;c.

                     <hi>Nov.</hi>
                  </note> a piece of great consequence on the sea-side.</p>
               <p>Then was it debated on both sides of translating the warre<note place="margin">1217</note>
                  <pb n="153" facs="tcp:21984:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
into Egypt. Which many advised to be done: For that countrey afforded the Turks their victuals and munition; and the best way to draw them low, was to stop them in the fountain. It was also most honour to rouse the Lion in his own denne. And Palestine was so forraged, that there was nothing to be gleaned in the stubble; whereas Egypt was so rich and fruitfull, it cared not for the frowns of heaven, so it might have the favour of Nilus; and there was no fear to want bread in that the granary of the world. That according to the rule, <hi>Plus animi est infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renti periculum, quàm propulsanti</hi>; the Christians would be heartened, but the Egyptians discouraged in the invasion of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt. The sad spectacle of their countreys vastation would dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb their minds, make them diffident of their own worth, and unsufficient to maintain their cause. Lastly, the Christians might leave when they list, reserving at all times Ptolemais to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them, in case fortune should crosse their designes.</p>
               <p>But the reasons to the contrary wanted not weight but weighing. They considered not (what was objected) That to invade a strong entire countrey without having a partie within it to side with them, was to endeavour to cleave a tree with a beetle without a wedge. Besides, Egypt was an exception from the rules of all other countreys, &amp; had certain locall maximes of leading of an armie appropriated to it-alone. That Valour must needs have the fall, when it wrestleth with Nature it self, and fighteth against bogs, rivers, and inundations. That it was more agreeable to reason, first to recover and defend what once was their own, before they attempted other mens possessions. That these their forces afforded little hope of victory in another Kingdome, which were not able to clear their own countrey, and the forts in Syria, from so dangerous an enemy. Lastly, That the Egyptians fighting for their fathers, wives, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, would raise their valour to the highest point of resolution. These arguments notwithstanding, the watch-word was given for Egypt; whither all addressed themselves.</p>
               <p>And here began the discords betwixt King John and the Popes Legate, who challenged not onely an influence but a predominancy in every thing, and would dictate to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall what he should do in martiall affairs: He presumed on his book-learning to controll the practice of experienced captains by his military speculations. The King stormed hereat, shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there were some mysteries in the Captain-craft not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municable to any which had not served the trade, and which the heart of a Scholar was too narrow to contain; That though Scholarship was a stock fit to graff any profession on, yet some good time is requisite thereunto; and that they must not think to proceed military Masters at their first admission in a camp; That
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:21984:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>
though the Legate might conceive himself to know the latitude of warlike principles, yet he knew not the use of distinctions, exceptions, and cautions of application; and might easily be misled by disproportion and dissimilitude of examples, the variation of circumstances, the infinitenesse of punctuall occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences: Wherefore he forbad him to meddle with martiall matters, challenging them to belong to his own disposall. But Pelagius the Legate highly opinioned of his own sufficiencie, as if his place made him infallible in every thing, and loth to confesse himself besides the cushion whilest he sat in the chair, would have an oar in all actions. He held this conclusion, That the generall rules of warre were easily known; and as for the qualification of them <hi>pro exigentia hîc &amp; nunc,</hi> herein reason was the key of the work, which scholars having most perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by learning, were thereby the most competent judges what should be done on all occasions. How dearly the Christians payed for this his errour, and how this discord, smothered for a while, brake out, we shall see hereafter. Mean time, hoising up sails, the Pilgrimes navie safely arrived at Damiata.</p>

               <p>First, with a great chain crossing the harbour: which with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defatigable pains, and art mingled with labour, they brake asunder; industry in action being as importunity in speech, by continuall inculcation forcing a yeelding beyond the strength of reason.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the river Nilus did much annoy them. This river (the height of whose flowing is the Egyptian Almanack, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they prognosticate future plenty or penury) now out of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:21984:87" rendition="simple:additions"/>

Against this mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief they fensed themselves with prayer, and a publick fast en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by the Legate; whereby the water soon abated. And lest Gods mercie herein, when gotten, should be forgotten, a publick thanksgiving was proclaimed, that this favour obtained by prayer might be kept by praises.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, they were to grapple with the fort of Pharia, a seeming-impregnable place, betwixt them and Damiata. To check this fort, the Christians built a towre on ships: which suddenly falling, brained many, bruised more of their own men; and all who felt not the blow, were stricken with the fright. King John comforted his souldiers discouraged hereat, desiring them to apprehend actions by their true causes; and as not to vaunt of blind victories, so not to be dismayed at casuall mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, so purely accidentall, that there was no guard against them in the schools of defense, either of wisdome or valour. By his advice a more substantiall towre was built, the rarest piece in that kind the world ever saw;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Aug.</hi> 24.</note> by the manning where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, after many bloudy assaults, they mastered the fort of Pharia.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, they had to do with Meladine King of Egypt, who lay besides them, constantly furnishing the citie with men and victuals, and exercising the Christians with continuall skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mishes. In one, with his wild-fire he did them much harm, and King John was dangerously scorched. But seeing that the Christians hewed their way through the rocks of all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,<note place="margin">1219</note> he propounded peace unto them by the mediation of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radine his brother,<note place="margin">

               <p>But the Legate would no wayes consent, alledging this voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was undertaken not onely for the recovery of Palestine, but for the exstirpation of the Mahometane superstition.

A full yeare the Christians stayed here, contented to make this inne their home. Here arose new discords betwixt the King and the new Legate, who by vertue of his Legation challenged Damiata for his Holinesse, which by publick agreement was formerly assigned to the King. Bren in anger returned to Ptolemais, both to puff out his discontents in private, &amp; to teach the Christians his worth by wanting him: For presently they found themselves at a losse; neither could they stand still without disgrace, nor go on without danger. The Legate commanded them to march up; but they had too much spirit to be ruled by a Spirituall man, and swore not to stirre a step except the King was with them. Messengers there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were sent to Ptolemais to fetch him. They found him of a steelie nature; once through-hot, long in cooling: yet by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising him he should have his own desires, they over-perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him not to starve an armie by feeding his own humours.</p>

                  <pb n="157" facs="tcp:21984:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>Scarce after eight moneths absence was he returned to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miata, but new divisions were betwixt them: The Legate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the armie to march up and besiege Cairo; he promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, if they would obey him, they should quickly command all Egypt, by present invading it. Let defendants lie at a close guard, and offer no play. Delayes are a safe shield to save, but celerity the best sword to winne a countrey. Thus Alexander conquered the world before it could bethink it self to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance. And thus God now opened them a doore of victorie, except they would barre it up by their own idlenesse.</p>
               <p>But the King advised to return into Syria; That Cairo was difficult to take, and impossible to keep; That the ground whereon they went, was as treacherous as the people against whom they fought; That better now to retire with honour, then hereafter flie with shame; That none but an empirick in warre will denie, but that more true valour is in an orderly well grounded retreat, then in a furious rash invasion.</p>
               <p>But the Legate used an inartificiall argument drawn from the authority of his place, thundering excommunication against those that would not march forward: And now needs must they go when he driveth them.</p>
               <p>The crafty Egyptians (of whom it is true, what is said of the Parthians, Their flight is more to be feared then their fight) ran away, counterfeiting cowardlinesse.

banks, and unmuzzling the river, let it runne open mouth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; yet so, that at first they drowned them up but to the middle, reserving their lives for a further purpose, thereby in exchange to recover Damiata and their countreys liberty.</p>
               <p>See here the land of Egypt turned in an instant into the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian sea! See an army of sixty thousand, as the neck of one man, stretched on the block, and waiting the fatall stroke! Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny cursed the Legate, and their own rashnesse, that they should follow the counsel of a gowned man (all whose experience was clasped in a book) rather then the advice of experienced captains. But too late repentance, because it soweth not in sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, reapeth nothing but unavoidable miserie.</p>
               <p>Meladine King of Egypt seeing the constancy and patience of the Christians, was moved with compassion towards them. He had of himself strong inclinations to Christianity, wearie of Mahometanisme, and willing to break that prison, but for watchfull jaylers about him. He profered the Christians their lives, on condition they would quit the countrey and restore Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miata. They accepted the conditions, and sent messengers to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miata to prepare them for the surrendring of it. But they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the citie, being themselves safe on shore, tyrannized on their poore brethren in shipwrack; pretending, That this armie of Pilgrimes deserved no pity, who had invited this misfortune on themselves by their own rashnesse; That if they yeelded up this citie for nothing, which cost so many lives, they should betray themselves to the derision of the whole world; That if these perished, more men might be had, but no more Damiata's; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a place of such importance, it would alwayes be a snaffle in the mouth of the Egyptian King. On the other side, the friends of the distressed Christians confessed, That indeed their voyage was unadvised and justly to be blamed; yet worse and more inconsiderate projects have armies oft undertaken, which, if crowned with successe, have been above censure, yea, have passed not onely without questioning but with commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: But this is the misery of misery, that those who are most afflicted of God, shall be most condemned of men. Wherefore they requested them to pity their brethren, and not to leave them in this forlorn estate. How clamourous would their inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent bloud be in the court of Heaven, to sue for revenge on those who forsook them in this distresse! And grant Damiata a citie of great consequence; yet cities in themselves were but dead things, and men were the souls to enliven them: so that those souldiers which wonne Damiata, if preserved alive, might haply recover as strong a citie afterwards.</p>
               <p>But finding their arguments not to prevail, they betook themselves to arms, by force to compell the adverse party to
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:21984:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
resigne the citie. King John also threatned, in case they denied to surrender it, to give up to Meladine Ptolemais in Syria in exchange for Damiata. At last, according to the agreement, Damiata was restored to the Turks, and the Christian armie let out of the trap wherein it was taken. Meladine out of his prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goodnesse furnished them with <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>P. Aemyl. pag.</hi> 205.</note> victuals, and with horses to carry their feeble persons upon. And thus the Christians had the greatest blow given them without a blow given them; the Egyptians obtaining their victory not by bloud but by water.</p>

               <p>THere was also concluded a peace with the Turks for eight yeares. And now matters being settled as well as they might be in Syria, King John took a journey to Rome; where he was bountifully feasted, and honourably entertained by the Pope. Here it was agreed (whether at the first by his volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry offer, or working of others, it appeareth not) that he should resigne the Kingdome of Jerusalem to Frederick the second, Germane Emperour, who was to marry Iole the sole daughter of King John by his first wife; though by a second he had ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Martha, married to Robert Emperour of Constantinople: so that he was father in law both to Emperour of East and West.</p>
               <p>Some condemned his resignation as an unadvised act; as if he had first parted from his wits, who would willingly part from a Kingdome; whilest others commend his discretion: For first, his wife was dead, in whose right he held his Kingdome, and thereby a doore was opened for other litigious pretenders to the Crown. Secondly, it was policie, <hi>fugere nè fugaretur</hi>: yea, this was no flight, but an honourable departure. Well he knew the Turks power to invade, and his own weaknesse to defend what was left in Syria: So that finding the weight too heavy for himself, he did well to lay it on stronger shoulders. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, before his resignation he had little more then a title: and after it he had nothing lesse; men having so tuned their tongues to salute him King of Jerusalem, that he was so called to the day of his death. Lastly, what he wanted in the statelinesse of his bed, he had in the soundnesse of his sleep; and though his commons perchance were shorter, yet he battled better on them.</p>

very slender, and make it almost quite nothing. We will not engage our selves in their quarrels; but may safely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, that Frederick was neither saint, nor devil, but man. Many vertues in him his foes must commend,<note place="margin">1227</note> and some vices his friends must confesse. He was <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Pantal. De viris illustr. Germ. part.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 121.</note> very learned, according to the rate of that age, especially for a Prince, who onely baiteth at learning, and maketh it not his profession to lodge in. Wise he was in projecting; nor were his thoughts ever so scattered with any sudden accident, but he could instantly recollect himself. Valiant he was, and very fortunate; though this tendeth more to Gods praise then his: Wondrous bountifull to scholars and souldiers; whose good will he enjoyed, for he payed for it.</p>
               <p>But this Gold had its allay of Cruelty; though this was not so much bred in him as he brought to it: Treasons against him were so frequent, he could not be safe but must be severe, nor severe without incurring the aspersion of crueltie. His Pride was excessive; and so was his Wantonnesse: A Nunnes vail was but a slender shield against his lust: This sinne he was given to, <note n="*" place="margin">Praeter gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis morem, <hi>Egnatius.</hi>

               <p>In a word, he was a better Emperour then a man, his vices being personall, most hurting himself; his vertues of a publick nature, and accomplishing him for government.</p>

               <p>IT is verily conceived that the Pope provided this match for Frederick to imploy him in Palestine, whilest he at home might play his game at pleasure. For as provident Nature in marshalling the elements, assigned fire a place in the verge and border of this lower world farre from the rest, lest otherwise the activity thereof might set the others in combustion: so the Pope disposed this hot violent-spirited Emperour farre off, and engaged him in a distant and dangerous warre out of the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Europe.</p>
               <p>Frederick smelt the project of his Holinesse, being also ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster in the art of dissembling, though he must acknowledge the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:21984:91" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Pope his senior in that faculty: Wherefore he deferred the performance of his promise and his voyage into Palestine from moneth to moneth, and yeare to yeare, wisely gaining time by losing it.</p>
               <p>The truth was, he was not yet ripe for such an expedition. The Pope was afraid of his valour, he of the Popes treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and more feared him behind his back then the Turk before his face. He was loth to let go the Eagle he had in hand, to catch the little bird that was in the bush. Wherefore as yet he refused to go, pleading that the eight yeares truce which King Bren had made with the Turks, was not yet expired; before which time to fight against them, was to fight against God and conscience: and that it was no way to propagate the Faith by breach of faith.</p>
               <p>Pope Honorius continued still to put him in mind of his promise: Yea, he rubbed his memory so roughly, he fetched off the skinne, with his threats and menaces. But before Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dericks journey began,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mar.</hi> 19.</note> Honorius his life ended, and Gregory the ninth succeeded him; who at the first dash excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Emperour for his delay.</p>
               <p>Know by the way, that his name-sake Gregory the seventh (otherwise Hildebrand) first hanselled his excommunication on Henry the fourth. Before his time the Imperiall majesty (what is observed of the Seal, that it is never hit with thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der) was never fulminated against with excommunication: af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward nothing more usuall; till the commonnesse of those thunderbolts caused their contempt, and the Emperours na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures were so used to this physick it would not work with them. Of late his Holinesse is grown more advised, very spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly using them, especially against Protestant Princes; count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it policie to hold that weapon within the scabbard which hath no other edge but what is given it by the opinion of those against whom it is used.</p>
               <p>Frederick at last cometh forth of Germany with his armie, marcheth through Italy, cometh to Brindisi, where the plague seiseth on his men, whereof died the Landtgrave of Thuringia,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sept.</hi> 13.</note> and others. Soon after he fell very desperately sick himself, which stayed his journey many moneths.</p>
               <p>It went neare to the Pope, that the Emperour was so neare to him: His case now was worse then formerly: For he had rouzed the Lion out of his denne, but could not get him into the net. His sicknesse must either be more or lesse to do good. And the Pope having no variety of weapons, excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him afresh, pretending Fredericks disease was onely the cramp of lazinesse, and that he was sick to do good, but swoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do mischief; as appeared by his unjust seising on the

goods of Lewis Landtgrave of Thuringia late deceased.</p>
               <p>The Emperour protested his innocencie, accused the Popes injustice, putting himself on the triall of all Christian Princes; to whom he wrote letters.<note place="margin">1228</note> At last health came, and Frederick departed,<note place="margin">

The fame of Fredericks valour and maiden fortune, never as yet spotted with ill successe, like an harbinger hastening be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, had provided victorie to entertain him at his arrivall; yea, this Emperour, swifter then Cesar himself, overcame before he came over into Palestine.</p>
               <p>At this time the state of the Turks in Syria was very aguish, and Fredericks coming put them into a shaking fit. <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> Coradine was dead, his children in minority, the Turkish Souldans facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, boiling in enmity one against another. Whereupon the Sultan of Babylon, who was of chiefest authority, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned Syria, profered Frederick so honourable conditions as he might desire, but could never hope for: namely, To restore unto him Jerusalem and all Palestine, in as full and ample a manner as it was possessed by Baldwine the fourth, before Sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine subdued it; To set all Christian captives at liberty; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, that the Turks might have accesse to the Sepulchre, (though not lodging in the citie but suburbs, and that in small numbers at a time) there to do their devotions, they also having a knowledge of, and giving an honour to Christ, though no better then ignorance and dishonour of him.</p>
               <p>Frederick before he ratified any thing by oath, sent to have the Popes approbation: <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>See that produced as it were in an instant which the succession of many yeares could not perform, all the Holy land recovered! Some gallants perchance (whose curious palates count all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quests drie meat which are not juyced with bloud) will dispraise this Emperours victory for the best praise thereof, because it was so easily gotten without drawing his sword for it. But they deserve to go naked who scorn to wear good clothes if they cost not dear.</p>
               <p>The Templars were vexed at heart that they had no partner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship in the glory of this action; yea, this touched their copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold: Had they lived lazie thus long in Palestine, sucking the <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Wherefore they wanting true merit to raise themselves to the pitch of Fredericks honour, sought by false detraction to depresse him to the depth of their own basenesse; defaming him, as if he conspired with the Sultan to the ruine of all Christianity.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hus the Christian affairs in Palestine were in good case and possibility of improvement. But the Pope knew he should catch no fish if the waters were thus clear: Wherefore he stirred up John Bren, Fredericks father in law (ghesse whether his plots ran not low when he used such dregs) to raise a rebellion in Italy against him.</p>
               <p>His Holinesse spread a false report of purpose, that Frederick was dead. Who would think there were so much substance in a shadow! This vain rumour wrought reall effects, strengthening Fredericks foes with hopes, and staggering his friends with fear and uncertainties. Bren striking the iron whilest it was hot, wonne many places from the Emperour: And though Time soon after was delivered of her daughter Truth, yet the confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation came too late, to shut the doore when the steed was stoln; the Pope having attained his ends, and served his turn already.</p>
               <p>A jubile of liberty was proclaimed to all the Emperours sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and they dispensed with from the Pope for their alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance to him. Milain, and many other cities in Italy, formerly Imperiall, danced at this musick, made a foot-cloth of their Masters livery, and from this time dated themselves Free-States. Here was brave gleaning, where all ranne away with whole
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:21984:93" rendition="simple:additions"/>
sheaves; where robbery was priviledged for lawfull purchase. And the Pope, wise enough not so to give away the pie but to keep the best corner for himself, carved all Apulia for his own part.</p>
               <p>Whilest hostility in Italy, treason beset Frederick in Syria; the Templars intimated to the Sultan his private project to wash himself in Jordan, that so he might be surprized. But the Sultan (no doubt out of pity to see a Lion catched in a Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap, there being a consanguinity of all Princes, and the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all bloud which runneth in their veins causing a sympathie of Majesty betwixt them) scorned to advantage himself by trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, and sent their letters to Frederick: Who afterwards u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Templars, and generally all the Clergie in Palestine (counting them complies with the Pope) coursely, not to say cruelly.</p>
               <p>At last having confirmed his ten yeares truce, and having appointed Reinoldus Duke of Bavaria his Lieutenant in Syria, without noise he cometh into Europe: For to return trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phantly in state, had been but an alarm to awaken envy, and a warning-piece for his enemies to prepare against him. He out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sailed fame it self, landing in Italy in person before he arrived there in report. Then the love of his loyall subjects, hitherto rather covered then quenched, appeared; and though former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forced to a contrary motion, returned now quickly to their own Prince their proper centre.</p>
               <p>Within fifteen dayes, assisted with the Duke of Spoletum, Frederick recovered all which was wonne from him, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravelled the fair web of John Brens victory, even to the very hemme thereof.</p>
               <p>Then was all Italy (resembled by Geographers for the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shion thereof, to a mans legge) troubled with the incurable gout of schisme and faction: Not a city of note in it which was not dichotomized into the sect of the Guelfes, which fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Pope, and Gibellines, which adhered to the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour.</p>

               <p>But that which kept both Christians and Turks in aw, and made them willing mutually to observe the truce, was the fear of the Tartars, a fierce nation, which now had their first flight out of their own nest into the neighbouring countreys.</p>
               <p>These Tartarians, anciently called Scythians, inhabit the Northern part of Asia, a countrey never conquered by any of the Monarchs, priviledged from their victorious arms chiefly by its own barrennesse: For except souldiers were ambitious of hunger and cold, here is nothing to countervail their pains of an invasion; yea, no meat to maintain them. It is true, rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barb the best of drugs groweth in this the worst of countreys: But souldiers seek rather for food then physick when they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade a countrey.

               <p>If it be surest to follow the most, the stream of writers make it called Tartaria from the river Tartar: but Europe and Asia will by wofull experience justifie the etymologie, if deduced from <hi>Tartarus,</hi> Hell.

Hence in gratitude they never count themselves more gay then when their helmets are hung with owls feathers.

He taketh and his subjects give him little lesse then divine honour; who in other things at this time were pure Pagans and Idolaters. Now their countrey, which is like a poore man whose common is overstocked with children, swarming with more bees then hives, sent their super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous numbers to seek their fortunes amongst the Christians. They needed no steel-armour who had iron-bodies. Onely with bows, cruelty, and multitude they overranne Lituania, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolia, Polonia, and those countreys which are the East-boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danes of Europe. Others took their way Southward into Asia, committing outrages as they went; and sensible how incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably their own countrey was surpassed for pleasure and profit by these new lands (blame not their judgement if they preferred a palace before a prison) they little cared to return home.</p>
               <p>Their incursions into Europe were so farre and frequent, that Pope Innocent the fourth, about the yeare 1245, began to fear them in Italy. Wherefore he sent Askelin, a Friar much admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in that age, with three other, into Tartaria, to convert that nation to Christianity. Where Askelin in stead of teaching them the elements of our religion, laid this foundation, to amplifie to them the power of the Pope, setting him out in his full di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mensions; How he was above all men in the Christian world. A good nurse, to feed infants, in stead of milk, with such drie bones: enough almost to affright them from entring into our Church, seeing such a giant as they painted the Pope, to stand before the doore.</p>
               <p>But Baiothnoi chief Captain of the Tartarian armie (for they were not admitted to speak with the great Cham himself) cried quits with this Friar, outvying him with the greatnesse and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of their Cham; and sent back by them a blunt let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter:

               <head>Chap. 3. The Greeks recover their Empire from the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines; The Holy warre thereby much enda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged.</head>
               <p>IT was conceived that it would be much beneficiall to the Pilgrimes in their voyages to Palestine, that the Latines were lately possessed of the Grecian Empire: For what is saved, is gained: And grant that the Latines in Greece should not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally assist in the Holy warre, yet it was a considerable advantage what all justly expected, That Pilgrimes should now have safe and secure passage through Grecia, the pitfall which formerly had devoured so many.</p>
               <p>But these fair hopes soon miscarried. For what through the celerity of Theodorus Lascaris, and the gravity of John Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas his sonne in law, who reigned as Grecian Emperours in Nice, the Greeks recovered every foot of ground that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines had wonne from them: Onely the Venetians being good at holdfast, kept their portion when all others had spent theirs, and enjoy Candie to this day. This is imputed to their discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in their choice, who in the sharing of this Empire amongst the Western Princes, refused the continent countreys (though greater in extent, and richer in cities) and chose rather the Islands, which being as little worlds in themselves, were most capable of entire fortifications, especially in their way, who were most powerfull at sea.</p>
               <p>Sixty yeares almost did the Latines make a hard shift to hold Constantinople, under five succeeding Emperours: 1. Baldwine the first,<note place="margin">1203.</note> Earl of Flanders; 2. Henry his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; 3. Peter,<note place="margin">1205.</note> Count of Auxerre in France, Henrie's sonne in law;<note place="margin">1216.</note>
                  <note place="margin">1221.</note> 4. Robert; 5. Baldwine the second, and last. An example which the observers of the ominous circulation or return of names alledge,<note place="margin">1238.</note> That as a Baldwine was the first, so a Baldwine was the last Latine Emperour in Grecia.</p>
               <p>Of these, the first Baldwine had his hands and feet cut off, and died in a ditch; Peter invited to a feast, payed the shot with his life; the other three died without any violence, but with much misery. And thus their conquest of Grecia, like a little sprig stuck into the ground, did sprout at the first whilest it had any sap in it, but then withered for want of a root.</p>
               <p>Indeed it was impossible long to continue: For when the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of the primitive adventurers in this action were dead, there wanted another to succeed them; and the countreys
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:21984:96"/>
whence they came were so farre off that supplies of Latine people came thither very slowly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Onely Venice well peopled her parts from the vicinity of her dominions. And that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of souldiers which is sufficient by sudden conquest to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne a countrey,<note place="margin">1237</note> is incompetent without a second edition of new supplies, to make good, manage, and maintain it: especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly being to meddle with the Greeks, farre exceeding them in number, subject onely out of fear, longing daily for their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and opportunity to recover it.</p>
               <p>Let never any Pilgrimes hereafter make Greece their inne in their journey to Palestine. Yea, also at this time the furnace of the Grecian jealousie was made seven times hotter: For be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides this Civil, an Ecclesiasticall and Spirituall breach happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed betwixt them and the Latines; which we come now to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe.</p>

               <p>HItherto Grecians and Latines lived together in Palestine in some tolerable correspondencie; differing in judgement, but complying in affections; as counting themselves two seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall sides, yet both making up the body of Christians. But now by an unhappy discord they were irreconcilably parted asunder, to the great advantage of the Turks and prejudice of the Holy warre. We will fetch this flame from the first spark; and though we go farre about, the length of the journey will be recompensed by the goodnesse of the way.</p>
               <p>Anciently in the primitive time the Church of Rome was esteemed the first and chiefest of all others, but without any jurisdiction above them. Because that was the Imperiall citie and Queen of the world, therefore the Church therein was highest in account; as the candle which is in the fairest can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestick is alwayes set above the rest (though otherwise equall unto it in light) at the upper end of the table.</p>
               <p>It happened afterward that the Emperour removed his seat from Rome to Constantinople: Whereupon orphane Rome suddenly decayed (for the Emperours court carried day with it, and left night behind it) was chief mourner at the funeralls of her own greatnesse; and from a pleasant garden turned a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dernesse overgrown with Goths, Vandals, and other barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous weeds: whilest Constantinople tricked and tired her self,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:21984:96" rendition="simple:additions"/>
started up in an instant great, rich, and stately; insomuch that John her Patriarch claimed to be universall Bishop above all other. Gregory the Great, Bishop of Rome, stoutly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood him, protesting that he was the usher of Antichrist who assumed that swelling title; wherein he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eated the brand to mark his successour with: For Boniface (save one, the next) Pope of Rome so dealt with Phocas the Emperour of Constantinople, that he got himself confirmed universall Bishop over the whole world. A Chaplain and a Patrone well met, both usurpers, supporting one another (like stones in an arch) with their reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall aid; Phocas held Boniface in his chair, and Boniface kept Phocas in his throne. And thus was the Pope of Rome first possessed of his Primacie both of dignity and authority, both of precedencie &amp; of power and jurisdiction over all other Churches. As for his pretense, to challenge it by commission from Christ and succession from Peter, this string to his bow is so full of gauls, frets, and knots, it cannot hold, and is broken by many learned Divines.</p>
               <p>However, Constantinople rather overborn then overcome, for want rather of strength then stomach, ever rebelled, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther resisted (for no rebellion against usurpation) Romes supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie (especially when she found her self befriended with any advantage) for many hundred yeares after.</p>
               <p>It happened (to come to the matter in hand) that a Grecian <note n="*" place="margin">

Where the Court demanded for him such unreasonable fees (toll more then the grift) that the Prelate perceived it would weaken him to be confirmed, and shake his estate to settle him in his Bishoprick. Home therefore he cometh with a loud alarm against the extortions of Rome, and mustereth together many of his countrey-men; who hereupon for ever withdrew their obedience from Rome, and threw off that heavy yoke they could not bear, hereafter owning her for their sister not mother.</p>
               <p>It may seem strange that the Romane Court being here just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taxed for extortion, would not amend it. But how often so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever she be told of her dirty face, she will never wash it: For re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming would argue a former fault; and they feared, if they yeelded themselves guilty in one point, it would shake the whole fabrick of their credit. Besides, if the Grecians had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived satisfaction and redresse in this grievance, it would have given them pretense to prepare more requests, and to think that they also were due. Lastly, no strength of perswasion will draw men from those sinnes which are glued unto them by their profit. Thus the avarice of the Romish officers (as of late the shamefull shamelesse covetousnesse of their Indulgence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:21984:97" rendition="simple:additions"/>
occasioned Luthers falling from them) caused the Grecians wholly to renounce their subjection to that See: and Germanus Patriarch of Constantinople now grew absolute of himself, without any dependencie on the Pope.</p>

               <p>BEsides their rejecting of the Popes both Ecclesiasticall and Temporall tyranny, the Greeks differ from the Latines in other matters of moment: For they maintain the procession of the holy Spirit from the Father alone. As for their other te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, they stand in some middle terms of opinion betwixt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists and Protestants; yet so, that they approch nearer the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists in more, to us in more weighty and dominative points. With Rome they concurre in Transubstantiation,<note place="margin">

With us they consent in the Sufficiency of the Scriptures to salvation, in denying the Infallibility of the Church (much more of the Pope) the overplus of Merits, Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ununderstood, Indulgences, Liberaties out of Purgatorie, and the like.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the Romanists condemn them all for hereticks and castawayes, killing more then a third of all Christians (as Cain did a quarter of mankind with a blow) with this their unchari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

censure. But heaven-gate was not so easily shut against multitudes when S. Peter himself wore the keyes at his girdle. And let us not with rash judging thrust all into the pit of hell whom we see walking neare the brink thereof. We shall think better of them if we consider, That</p>
               <p>First, their tenets wherein they dissent from the Romanists are sound enough, save that of the holy Ghost. Concerning which it is an usefull <hi>quaere,</hi> Whether, granting the first au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours and ringleaders of that errour in a bad condition, there be not some favour to be allowed to those who in simplicity succeed to hereditary errours received from their ancestours, if they do not wilfully barre nor bolt their eyes against the beams of the truth, but be willing (as we charitably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive of the Greeks) to receive and embrace better instruction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the Master of the Sentences (waited on herein with other <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Thirdly, our quickest sight in the matters of the Trinity is but one degree above blindnesse. Wherefore, as concerning it, let our piety lodge there where in other disputes the deceit of sophisters used to nestle it self, namely, <hi>in universalibus,</hi> in large and generall expressions, and not descend to curious particulars. To search into the manner of the Spirits procession, is neither manners nor religion, and rather falleth under an awfull adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and belief then an exact and curious enquirie.</p>
               <p>Lastly, this their tenet doth not infect any other point in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity with its poysonous inferences. Some errours are worse in their train then in themselves, which (as the Dragon in the Revelation drew down a third part of the starres with his tail) by their bad consequences pervert other points of religion: But this Grecian opinion (as learned men propound it) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the holy Ghost, hath this happinesse, that it is barren, and begetteth no other bad tenets from it, being entire in it self.</p>
               <p>More may be alledged for the lessening of this errour: But grant it in its full extent, yet surely the moderate judgement of that learned <note n="*" place="margin">

               <head>Chap. 6. A comparative estimate of the extent of the Greek and Latine Church; What hope of reconcilement betwixt them; The influence this breach had on the Holy warre.</head>
               <p>IF that religion were surely the best which is of the greatest latitude and extent, Surveyers of land were fitter then Divines to judge of the best religion. Neither is it any matter of great moment to measure the greatnesse of either Church: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause Rome maketh her Universality such a masterpiece to boast of, let us see if the Greek Church may not outshoot her in her own bow.</p>
               <p>If we begin with the Grecian Church in Africa under the Patriarch of Alexandria, thence proceeding into Asia, and fetch a compasse about Syria, Armenia, Asia the lesse, with Cyprus, Candie, and other Islands in the mid-land-sea, and so come into Grecia; if hence we go into Russia and Muscovia (who though differing in ceremonies, dissent not in doctrine; as a sundry dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect maketh not a severall language) to take onely entire King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and omit parcels: it is a larger quantity of ground then that the Romish religion doth stretch to, since Luther cut so large a collop out of it, and withdrew North-Europe from obedience to his Holinesse.</p>
               <p>Perchance the Romanists may plead they have lately impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the patrimony of their religion by new purchases in both Indies: But who knoweth not that those people, rather watered then baptized, affrighted with cruelty into Christianity, deserve not to be accounted settled and well-grounded professours of their religion?</p>
               <p>As for reconciliation betwixt the Grecians and Latines, it is utterly improbable, except the Greeks submit to the Popes Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie, which they will never do. No hope then of their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing together, when neither party will stirre step towards other.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="177" facs="tcp:21984:98"/>True it is, some fourty yeares since (<hi>anno</hi> 1594) the Bishops of little Russia (a countrey following the Eastern Church, but under the King of Poland) on condition they would accept the Popes <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Besides the hatred they have against the Popes pride, another great hindrance of the union is the small intercourse the Eastern Christians have or desire to have with the Western. They live amongst the Turks, and are grown to be contented slaves; and having long since parted with their hopes, now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most have lost their desire of liberty.</p>
               <p>We must not forget, how some fifty yeares ago solemn news was reported in Rome, that the <note n="*" place="margin">

And though afterwards this report was controlled to be false, yet mens spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits then being cold, were not so sensible of it as before: and the former news came to many mens eares who never heard af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards of the check and confutation thereof. Nor is there any State in the world that maketh such use and advantage, as the Papall doth, of false news. To conclude; As it is a maxime in Philosophy, <hi>Ex quibus constamus, ex iisdem nutrimur:</hi> so a great part of their religion consisting of errours and falshoods, it is suitable that accordingly it should be kept up and maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with forgeries and deceits.</p>
               <p>To return to Palestine; This rent (not in the seam but whole cloth) betwixt these Churches was no mean hindrance to the Holy warre. Formerly the Greeks in Syria were not so clearly cut asunder from the Latines, but that they hung together by one great sinew in the common cause, agreeing against the Turk the enemy to both: But since this last breach, the Greeks did in their desires propend and incline to the Turks, being better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented they should conquer, from whom they should have fair quarter, free exercise of their religion, and secure dwelling in any citie, paying a set tribute; then the Latines, who they feared would force their consciences, and bring their souls in subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Popes supremacie. Expect we then never hereafter, that either their hearts or hands should afford any assistance to our Pilgrimes in their designes.</p>

In that age Sermons were news, and meat for Princes not common men: Yea, the Albingenses with
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:21984:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>
their preaching had drowned the voices of secular Priests, if these two Orders had not helped to out-noise those supposed hereticks. These amplified with their rhetorick the calamity of the Christians, tyrannie of the Turks, merit of the cause, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of successe; performing their parts with such gravity, shew of devotion, accents of passion, not glued on for the present purpose but so naturall as from true affection, that many were wooed to undertake the voyage:<note place="margin">1239</note> Principally, Theobald King of Navarre, Almerick Earl of Montfort, Henry of Champaigne, Peter Earl of Bretaigne, with many others of inferiour rank.</p>
               <p>Ships they had none; wherefore they were fain to shape their passage by land through Grecia: where they were entertained with treachery, famine, and all the miseries which wait on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stressed armies. These came last that way, &amp; (I may say) shut the doore: For no Christian army ever after went that tedious jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney by land.</p>
               <p>Having passed the Bosporus, they marched into Bithynia: thence through Galatia they came unto the mountain Taurus; where they were much damnified by the Turks, who fell on and off upon them, as they were advised by their own advantages. The Christians desired no other gift but that a set battel might be given them; which the Turks would not grant, but played at distance and would never close. But with much ado the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians recovered to Antioch, having scarce a third part of them left, their horses all dead, and themselves scarce mounted on their legs, miserably weak; as what the mercy of sword, plague, and famine had pleased to spare.</p>
               <p>Hence the Templars conducted them to Gaza; where they fell on forraging the countrey of the Sultan, assaulting no pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which were of strength, or honour to subdue, but onely spoiled poore villages, which counted themselves walled with the truce as yet in force. Abundance of wealth they got, and were now late returning home, when after their plentifull sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per a deare &amp; sharp reckoning was called for: Behold, the Turks in great numbers fell upon them neare unto Gaza; and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians down with their bundles of spoil, and out with their swords, bravely defending themselves till such time as the night parted the fray. Here they committed a great errour, and (as one may say) a neglect in over-diligence: for in stead of repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing themselves to rest, and appointing a set watch, they all lay in a manner <hi>Perdues,</hi> no one slumbering all night, but attending their enemies; contrary to the rules of an armie, which with Argus should never have all its eyes wake or sleep together. Next morning when the Turks, whose numbers were much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased, set upon them, alas! they being but few to many, faint to fresh, were not able to make any forcible resistance: Yet,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:21984:100" rendition="simple:additions"/>
what they could not pay in present, they pawned their lives for; and their arms being too weak for their hearts, they were rather killed then conquered. Earl Henry was slain, Almerick taken prisoner, the King of Navarre escaped by the swiftnesse of his Spanish gennet; which race, for their winged speed, the Poets feigned to be begot of the wind.</p>
               <p>Mean time the other Christians looked on, and saw their brethren slaughtered before their eyes; and yet though they were able to help them, were not able to help them, their hands being tied with the truce, and Reinoldus charging them no way to infringe the peace concluded with the Sultan. Hereupon many cursed him as the Christians cut-throat; he as fast con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned the King of Navarre and his army for breaking the truce. And though the Papall faction pleaded that the former peace concluded not these late adventurers, and that it was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made with Frederick the Emperour; yet he representing the whole body of Christianity, all the bundle of their shifts could not piece out a satisfactory answer, but that they were guilty of faith-breaking.</p>
               <p>Home hastened the King of Navarre with a small retinue, clouding himself in privatenesse; as they actour who cometh off with the dislike of the spectatours, stealeth as invisibly as he may into the tiring-house. Expectation, that friendly foe, did him much wrong; and his performance fell the lower, because men heightened their looking for great matters from him.</p>

               <p>THe desperatenesse of the disease priviledgeth the taking of any Physick. The Christians being now in deep distresse, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved on a dangerous course, but (as their case stood) thought necessary: For they made peace with the Sultan of Damascus and Seisser, and with the Sultan of Cracci; (These were Dyna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes in Syria of some good strength, and were at discord with the Sultan of Babylon) and swearing them to be faithfull, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed an armie of their forces, with them joyntly to resist the Corasines; seeking, saith <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Robert Patriarch of Jerusalem was a most active commander over all. S. Lukes day was the time agreed upon for the fatall battel; neare Tiberias was the place. As the Christians were ordering themselves in aray, it was questioned in what part of their armie their new Turkish assistants should be disposed, and concluded that they should be placed in the front, where if they did no other good, they would dull the appetite of their enemies sword. This is thought to have been a notorious er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, and cause of their overthrow. For though those souldiers who mean to be false, will never be made faithfull in what place soever they be bestowed, yet may they be made lesse dangerous if cast into the body or main battel of the army, whence they have no such scope to fling out, and to take advantage of place to do mischief, as they have either in the front or wings there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

The Christians manfully stood to it, and though over-powerd in number, made a great slaughter of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, till at last they were quite overthrown.

               <p>Thus were the Christians conquered by the Corasines, and beaten by a beaten nation; Palestine being wonne by those who could not keep their own countrey.

               <p>Whilest Lewis stayed in Cyprus, the Templars in the Holy land began to have his greatnesse in suspicion.

               <p>BUt he stood so long in aiming, that the bird saw him, and had leisure to flie away, and Meladine the Egyptian King to provide himself to make resistance. Last time (some thirty yeares before) whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Christians under John Bren invaded Egypt, they were not impeached in their arrivall, but suffered to land with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any opposition. But Meladine now was sensible of the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodity in permitting his foes safely to come on shore: For first, they wasted &amp; spoiled the countrey &amp; the provision about them: Secondly, opportunity was given to male-contents and ill-disposed persons to flie to the enemie: Lastly, he found it most policie to keep the enemy off at arms end, and to close at the last; and not to adventure his Kingdome on the single die of a battel, but rather to set it on a chance, that so he might have the more play for it. Wherefore he resolved to strengthen his maritime places, and not suffer them to land; though also here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he met with many difficulties. For as nothing was more cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain then that Lewis would set on Egypt, so nothing more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain; and because it was unknown at what time or place he would come, all times and places were provided for. This ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted a masse of treasure to keep in pay so many souldiers for many moneths together. But it is no time to dispute about un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary thrift, when a whole Kingdome is brought into que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion to be subdued.</p>
               <p>And because the landing-places in Egypt are of great disad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:21984:105" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to the defendants, yeelding them no shelter from the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of their enemies artillery, being all open places and plain (the shores there being not shod against the sea with huge high rocks, as they are in some other countreys, because the land is low and level) Meladine was forced to fortifie welnigh an hundred and eighty miles along the sea-side; and what Nature had left bare, Art put the more clothes on; and by using of great industry (such as by Tully is fitly termed <hi>horribilis industria</hi>) in short space all that part of Egypt was fenced which respecteth the sea.</p>
               <p>Winter being past, Robert Duke of Burgundie and Alphonse King Lewis his brother arrived in Cyprus with a new armie; and hereupon they concluded to set forward for Egypt, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to land neare Damiata.<note place="margin">

Besides, those on land threw their weapons downwards from the forts they had erected, so that the declivity and downfall did naturally second the violent impression of their darts. How-ever, the Infidels at last were here beaten with what commonly was their own weapon, I mean multitude; so that they fled into the town, leaving behind them their governour and five hundred of their best souldiers dead on the shore.<note place="margin">5.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Damiata was a strong city, the taking whereof was accounted the good task of an armie for a yeare. But now the Egyptians within were presented afresh with the memory of the miseries they indured in the last long siege by the Christians; and fearing lest that tragedy should be acted over again, set fire on their houses, and in the night saved themselves by flight. The French issuing in quenched the fire,<note place="margin">9.</note> and rescued much corn and other rich spoil from the teeth of the flame.</p>
               <p>Meladine much troubled with this losse, to purchase peace <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>ABout this time brake out the dissensions betwixt the French and English. The cause whereof (as some say) was, for that the Earl of Sarisbury in sacking a fort got more spoil then the French. But surely the foundation of their discontents lay much lower, being an old enmity betwixt the two nations; and Robert Earl of Artois used Earl William and his men with much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courtesie.</p>
               <p>This Robert stood much on the Royaltie of his descent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brother to King Lewis, though nothing of kin in conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons being as bountifull to deal injuries and affronts as the other alms and charitable deeds. The English Earl, though he stood on the lower ground in point of birth, yet conceived himself to even him in valour and martiall knowledge. And though godly King Lewis used all his holy-water to quench these heart-burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, his successe answered not his pains, much lesse his desires; onely his cooling perswasions laid their enmities for the present fairly asleep.</p>
               <p>Amidst these broils died Meladine the Egyptian King. A worthy Prince he was; though some write very coursely of him: as he must rise early, yea, not at all go to bed, who will have every ones good word. Let Christians speak of him as they found: whose courtesies to them when they were half-drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Egypt, if they will not confesse, they deserve to be whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly drowned for their ingratitude. In the latter end of his age he quite lost the good will of his subjects, and lived unloved, and died unlamented, though a deserving and fortunate man, which oftentimes covereth a multitude of faults. The chief reason whereof was, because they suspected him to be unsound in his religion, and offering to Christianity: Besides, having reigned above thirty yeares, his government became stale; and good things, if of long continuance, grow tedious, they being rather affected for their variety then true worth: Lastly, the rising

sunne stole the adorers from the sunne setting; and Melechsala his sonne being an active and promising Prince, reigned before in mens desires over the Kingdome. To him now they all ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied themselves; and having more wisdome in their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on then the Christians, instantly ceased their private dissensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And now the Sultans of Damascus, Aleppo, and Babylon twisted themselves in a joynt agreement with Melechsala to defend their Mahometane religion.</p>

With some danger and more difficulty they passed an arm of Nilus, being conducted by a fugitive Saracen to a place where it was foordable. Hence Earl Robert marched forward with a third part of the army, and suddenly assaulting the Turks in their tents (whilest Melechsala was absent in solemnizing a feast) put them to flight. Hereupon this Earl proclaimed himself in his hopes Monarch of the world: This blow made his enemies reel, the next would fell them: Now speed was more needfull then strength: This late victory, though gotten, was lost if not used: What though they were not many? the fewer the adventurers, the greater the gain: Let them therefore forwards, and set on the whole power of the Turks, which was incamped not farre off.</p>
               <p>But the Master of the Templars,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. pag.</hi> 1049.</note> in whom the sap of youth was well dried up, advised the Earl to stay and digest the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour he had gotten, expecting the arrivall of the rest of their armie: for the work was weighty they undertook, and needed two shoulders, the united strength of the Christians, effectually to manage it: His souldiers were weary, and must be refreshed; and it was madnesse to starve them to day in hope of a feast to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>morrow: That they were to march through a strange countrey, and their best instructours were behind: let them stay for their lantern, and not go in the dark. He minded him that he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valued his victory, not considering the enemies strength, whose harvest was not spoiled by losing an handfull of men.</p>
               <p>But the Earl, full of the emptinesse of self-conceit, allowed
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:21984:107"/>
no counsel for currant but that of his own stamp. He scorned to wait the leisure of another opportunity, and opprobriously ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to the <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Here the Earl of Sarisbury interposed himself to make peace, and to perswade Robert to listen to the wholesome counsel that was given him. But his good will was rewarded with Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, Dastard, English-tail, and such like contumelious terms. Wherefore said our Earl, Well, Generall, on in Gods name; <note n="*" place="margin">Erimus (credo) ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, ubi non audebis cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam equi mei attingere, <hi>Idem ibid.</hi>

               <p>Marching on, they assaulted the castle of Mauzar, and were notably repulsed; and Melechsala coming in with his whole strength, hemmed them in on every side. The Christians were but the third part of the armie; and at the present, they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves were scarce the half of themselves, being faint for want of refreshing. Yet never shall one reade more valour in so little a volume: They played their parts most stoutly. As for the French Earl who went on like thunder, he went out like smoke, crying to the Earl of Sarisbury, Flee, flee, for God fighteth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst us. To whom our Earl, God forbid my fathers sonne should flee from the face of a Saracen. The other seeking to save himself by the swiftnesse of his horse, and crossing the river, had there water enough to drown him, but too little to wash from him the stain of rashnesse and cowardise. Thus died the Earl of Artois: who had in him the parts of a good Generall, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and in transposition, bold in counsel, fearfull in execution. He was one of that princely quaternion of brothers which came hither at this voyage, and exceeded each other in some quality; Lewis the Holiest, Alphonse the Subtillest, Charles the Stout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, and this Robert the Proudest.</p>
               <p>As for the Earl of Sarisbury, he resolved to sell his life at such a rate that the buyer should little boast of his peny-worth, slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many a Turk; and though unhorsed and wounded in his legs, stood on his honour when he could not stand on his feet; and refusing all quarter, upon his knees laid about him like a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate man. The longer he fought, the fewer wounds he had; and there at last he breathed forth his soul in the midst of his enemies. Of all the Christians there escaped no more then two Templars, one Hospitaller, and one common souldier, the mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers of this heavy news.</p>
               <p>The French writers, because they can say little good, say lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of this battel, and lessen the overthrow as much as may be; which Authours of other nations have more fully reported.

               <p>IT is easier to be conceived then expressed, what generall grief this dolefull news brought to the French; who followed not farre off, and who before had cause enough to sorrow for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: For the plague began to rage furiously amongst them, and daily swept away thousands. Mean time good King Lewis sent many of the weakest and impotentest people down the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to Damiata, there to enjoy the benefit of privacie, good at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance, and physick. Melechsala having intelligence hereof, met them by the way; and setting upon them (having neither arm to fight, nor legs to runne away) either burned or drowned them all, save one English man, Alexander Giffard (whose anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and famous family flourisheth to this day at Chellington in Staffordshire) who wounded in five places of his bodie, escaped to the French, and reported what had happened to the rest.</p>
               <p>And by this time Melechsala understood of the correspon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency betwixt King Lewis and the governour of Cairo, for the betraying of the city: Whereupon he caused him suddenly to be apprehended; whereby the French King lost all hopes to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that place of importance. Yea, now full willingly would the Christians have accepted the terms formerly offered them; and now their hungry stomachs would make dainties of those conditions which before, when full of pride, they threw away as fragments. But the Turks now sleighted them as not worth the treating with; and as knowing that these Frenchmen, who at their first landing were more then men, would at last be lesse then women.</p>
               <p>Then began the French Lords to perswade King Lewis to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:21984:108" rendition="simple:additions"/>
provide for the safety of his own person, and to return to Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miata. They told him, That if he stayed with them, there was no hope grounded on probability (and what was any other but a wilfull self-delusion?) of his escaping: If he were killed, his death would be a living shame to their religion; if taken prisoner, how would Mahomet insult over Christ! The captivity of the most Christian of the most Christian Kings would be foundation enough for the Turks thereon to build tropheys of eternall tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph. But Lewis would not leave them, that they might not leave him, but resolved to be a commoner with them in weal and wo; disdaining to be such a niggard of his life as not to spend it in a good cause in so good company.</p>
               <p>Forward they march, and come to the fatall place where the last battel was fought. There behold the mangled, headlesse, handlesse, feetlesse corpses of their fellow-countreymen. They knew in generall they were all their friends; none knew his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular friend. The cause of this unwonted cruelty to the dead, was a proclamation which Melechsala made, assigning a great summe of money to every one who would bring the head, hand, or foot of a Christian: And this made many of his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous cowards (who carried their valour in their purses) to be couragious. Whilest the French were here bemoning their fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, Melechsala came upon them with an infinite multitude,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Apr.</hi> 5.</note> and put them all (being few and feeble) to the sword; taking King Lewis, with his two brethren, Alphonse and Charles, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners.</p>
               <p>Instantly the Turks went up with French ensignes to Damia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, hoping so suddenly to surprise it. Which project had it took effect, then farewell King Lewis for ever. He must be sent a present to the Caliph of Babylon, from whom never any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned alive; Melechsala being but Purgatory, whence there was redemption; but the Babylonian Caliph Hell it self, from whence no hope of release. But God defeated their designe; for the Turks could not French it so handsomely, but that they were discovered. The very language of their hands made them suspected afarre off, because they could not counterfeit the French idiotismes in managing their bucklers, that nation being most punctuall and criticall in their military postures: But being come neare, it was plain for any to read Turk in their beards and complexions; so that they departed without having what they desired.</p>

But so great an eclipse could not long be kept from the eyes of the world; &amp; this dolefull and dismall news was sounded and seconded from every side. Then was there a generall lamentation over all Christendome, chiefly in France, where all were so sorrowfull, that any mirth was counted profanenesse.

Some say, that he never intended it; and that this onely was a trick to stroke the skittish cow to get down her milk. His stubborn subjects said, that they would tarry for his company till midsummer, and no longer. Thus they weighed out their obedience with their own scales, and the King stood to their allowance. But hearing of this sorrowfull accident, both Prince and people altered their resolution; who had come too late to help the French in their distresse, and too soon to bring themselves into the same misery.</p>

               <p>But see here a sudden alteration: One Tarqueminus a sturdy Mamaluke, with another of that society, killed Melechsala in the very height of his victorious happinesse, and succeeded him in the Egyptian Kingdome. This Tarquemine came in with an intent to send Lewis the same way: Which poore Prince was onely armed with innocence and majesty, and yet his bare per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son defended his person from that cruel attempt: such an awfull impression did his very presence, saith my Authour, strike into him who would have stricken him. But we may rather think that the city of Damiata was King Lewis his corslet, and that all the towres and walls of that place fensed him; Tarqueminus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving his person as an equivalent ransome, thereby to redeem that royall citie.</p>
               <p>Now Lewis had changed his Lord, but not his lamentable condition, continuing still a prisoner. At last he was restored to his liberty, on condition, that the Christians should surrender Damiata, and he also pay back to the Turks many thousand
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:21984:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
pounds, both for ransome of Christian captives, and in satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the vastations they had committed in Egypt. Lewis for security of this money, pawned to the Turk the Pyx and Host (that is, the body of Christ transsubstantiated in the Eucharist) as his chiefest jewel which he should be most carefull to redeem. Hence, in perpetuall memory of this conquest, we may see a <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Note by the way, that the Turks were most unreasonable in their rates of ransoming souldiers, and in all other their pecunia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry demands. For their own countrey being neare to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of gold and silver, they made as if it flowed as plentifully in other places, measuring the wealth of other lands by their own, and asking as much for a private mans ransome as would drain a Princes purse in these Western parts.</p>
               <p>Thus was Damiata restored again to the Turks, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians punctually performed their promises; though the false Miscreant on the other side set not half the captives free, killed all the sick persons whom by promise he should relieve, and (contrary to the agreement) suffered not any Christian to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any of his goods out of Egypt.</p>
               <p>Hence Lewis sailed to Ptolemais: where he lived in a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble case, being forsaken of his brothers, subjects, friends, and the Pope himself. His brothers, Alphonse and Charles, though sent into France to solicite his suit, and to advance his ransome with speed, yet being arrived forgot the affliction of Joseph; and the King was as farre from their mind as their sight: Wherefore God justly visited Alphonse with an incurable disease. His sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, though furious at first in bemoning him, yet the fit past, complained not so much for him as on him; charging him for ill managing the matters in Egypt by his cowardlinesse and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>discretion. His friends, the Pisans and Genoans, reviled him as the marrer of their mart, Damiata being formerly their most gainfull port; but now their hony was spoiled by destroying the hive: For the Sultan seeing the city taken twice of the Christians in short time, to prevent further dispute about it, took away the subject of the question, and rased it to the ground. The Pope forsook him: And though many intreated his Holinesse not to prosecute the Emperour Frederick any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, from whom Lewis expected all the beams of his comfort, yet he would heare of no submission from him, but sought fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally to ruine him. Onely Blanch, King Lewis his mother, was carefull for her sonne, and laboured his cause day and night. But alas! her arms were too short to bring all ends together. And having gathered a considerable summe of money, and shipped it for Palestine, a tempest in a moment <note n="*" place="margin">

her care and thrift was many moneths in getting. All this he bore with a soul not benummed with Stoicall senselessenesse, but becalmed with Christian patience:<note n="*" place="margin">

It somewhat mitigated his misery, that he had the company of his consort Margaret, a woman wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy so good a husband. Here she bore him a child, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause another Benoni, or Sonne of sorrow, was called Tristram. But that <note n="*" place="margin">S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Tristram a Knight long before. <hi>See Carew, in Cornwall, fol.</hi> 61.</note> name is more ancient, nor had it its birth from the christening of this child.</p>
               <p>Foure yeares King Lewis lived (not to say, loitered) in Syria, daily expecting in vain that some Prince of Europe should fetch him off with honour, being loth to return till he could carry home his credit with him. And though he was out of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, yet was he in his kingdome, whilest surveying there the sacred monuments wherewith he was so highly affected.</p>

               <p>Saladine (as is touched <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>chap.</hi> 40.</note> before) was the first of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Kings who began the gainfull trade of the Mammalukes. These were Christian captives, brought out of Taurica Cherso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesus, and instructed as in Mahometanisme so in all military discipline; Saladine disposing them in martiall nurseries, and continuing a constant succession of them one under another. It is above belief how much and speedily they were improved in warlike exercises: Art doubled their strength by teaching them to use it. And though they came rough out of their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, they were quickly hewen and polished by education: yea, their apprehensions prevented the precepts, and their practice surpassed the presidents of those that instructed them. As it is observed in fruits and flowers, that they are much bettered by change to a fitter soil; so were these people by altering their climate: The cold countrey wherein they were bred, gave them big and robustious bodies; and the hot climate whereinto they were transplanted, ripened their wits, and bestowed upon them
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:21984:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
craft and activity, the dowrie of the Southern countreys. They attained to be expert in any service; especially they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent horsemen: and at last they began to ride on the backs and necks of the Turkish Kings themselves.</p>
               <p>True it is, Saladine kept his distance over them, used them kindly, yet made them not wantons; and so poised these Mamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lukes with his native Egyptians, that in all actions he still reser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the casting voice for himself. But Meladine and Melechsala his successours, entertained them without number, and instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them beyond reason, so that under them in a manner they monopolized all places of strength and command; till at last, the stemme of these mercenary souldiers being too great for the stock of the natives, the Turkish Kingdome in Egypt, like a top-heavy tree, became a windfall. Indeed, the dastardnesse of the Egyptians made these Mammalukes more daring and insolent. For the Egyptians more loved profit then honour, &amp; wealth then greatnesse; and though contented to abide labour, would in no wise undergo danger. Merchandise they were wholly imployed in; and it seemed they used trading so long, till at last they made sale of their own spirits. Yea, one could not now know Egypt to be Egypt, but onely by the overflowing of Nilus, not by any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining ancient marks of valour in the peoples disposition. Thus the <hi>genius</hi> of old Kingdomes in time groweth weaker, and doteth at the last.</p>
               <p>But to come to Tarqueminus; He being one of these Mamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lukes, and perceiving how easie it was for those that did sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, to supplant the Turkish Kings, with another of his associ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates slew Melechsala, as it was said. And because it was unfit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting so great a Prince should go to the grave alone, he also sent his children and intimate friends thither to attend him. Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queminus afterwards procured of his society to be chosen King of Egypt. He was the Solon or Lycurgus of this slavish common-wealth; and by the consent of the rest of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny he enacted many laws: Whereof these were those of the Grand Charter, which admitted of no revocation:

                     <item>Secondly, That none should be admitted to the Order of the Mammalukes which were either Jews or Turks by birth, but onely such as being born Christians, were afterwards taken ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives, and then from the time of their slavery had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed in the Mahometane religion.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, That though the sonnes of the Mammalukes might enjoy their fathers lands and wealth, yet they might not take upon them the name or honour of a Mammaluke.</item>
                     <item>Fourthly, That the native Egyptians should be permitted no

               </p>
               <p>In surveying this State, we can turn no way but must meet with wonders:
<list>
                     <item>First, one would think that there was such an indelible cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of slavery in these captives, and such a <hi>laesum principium</hi> in them, that none of them ever should make a good Prince, as knowing no more how to sway a sceptre then a pure clown to manage a sword; or else that they should over-state it, turn ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, and onely exchange their slavery, by becoming vassals to their own passions. Yet many of them in their kinds were wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Princes for government, no whit inferiour to those which are advantaged with royall birth and breeding.</item>
                     <item>Secondly, it is a wonder they should be so neglective of their own children. How many make an idol of their posterity, and sacrifice themselves unto it, stripping themselves out of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries to provide their heirs a wardrobe! yea, it is a principle in most moderate minds, to advance their posterity; thinking hereby in a manner they overcome death, and immortalize their memories, in leaving their names and honours to their children: Whereas the contrary appeared in these Mammalukes.</item>
                     <item>Thirdly, it is admirable that they fell not out in the election of their Prince, being in a manner all equall amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. We see elective States in Christendome, though bound with the straitest laws, often sagge aside into schismes and factions; whereas this strange Empire in their choice had no dangerous discords, but such as were quenched in the kindling.</item>
                     <item>Lastly, who ever knew a wall that had no better cement, to stand so sure and so long? Two hundred sixty and seven yeares this State endured; and yet had it to do with strong and puissant enemies. Some Kingdomes ow their greatnesse not so much to their own valour and wisdome as to the weaknesse of their neighbours: but it fared not thus with the Mammalukes. To o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Prester John, who neighboured them on the south; on all other sides they were encompassed with potent opposers: From whom right valiantly they defended themselves, till in the yeare 1517 they were overcome by Selimus the great Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Emperour.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude; As for the Amazons and their brave atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with much valour and no manhood; they and their State had onely being in the brains of fabulous writers: As for the Assasines, or regiment of rogues; it never spread to the breadth of any great countrey, nor grew to the height of a Kingdome; but being the jakes of the world, was cast out in a place betwixt barren hills: But this Empire of vassals was every way won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfull, stretching so farre over all Egypt and most of Syria,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:21984:111" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and lasting so long. A strange State! wherein slavery was the first step to their throne, and apostasie the first article in their religion.</p>

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1250</note>IN this same yeare Frederick King of Jerusalem and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of Germany ended his troublesome dayes. A Prince, who in the race of his life met with many rubs, some stumbles, no dangerous falls. Besides the Turk, he had to do with the Pope (the Pope immortall in his succession.) And though his Holinesse was unfit for warre (as being alwayes old, and never ripe for that place till almost rotten) yet he used his own head, and commanded the hands of others; whereby he kept Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick in a continuall warre. Yet never could he have beaten him with fair play, had he not used a weapon, if not against the law of Arms, against the law of God, and against which no guard, Arming his subjects against him, and Dispensing with the oath of allegeance.</p>
               <p>But he gave Frederick the mortall wound, in setting himself against himself; I mean, Henry his eldest sonne. And though Frederick easily conquered that rebellious youth, and made him fast enough, keeping him in prison in Apulia, where he died; yet he carried the grief hereof to his grave. For now he knew not where or in whom to place any confidence; as suspecting the single cord of Loyaltie would not hold in others, which brake in his own sonne though twisted with Naturall affection.</p>
               <p>The greatnesse of his spirit was a great hastening of his death; and being of a keen, eager, and active nature, the sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the sword cut the scabbard the sooner asunder. Bowe he could not, break he must. What-ever is reported, he died of no other poison then sorrow (which ushered him into a wasting ague) grief being a burden whereof the strongest shoulders can bear the least. As for the fame, that <note n="*" place="margin">

He forbad any state<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly funerall for himself, though in his life immoderately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessive in pomp; as if he would do penance for his pride after death. A Prince, who had he not been hindred with domesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call discords, would have equalized Cesar himself: For if thus bravely he laid about him, his hands being tied at home with continuall dissensions, what would he have done if at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty?

               <p>We must not forget a memorable passage which happened more then twenty yeares after Fredericks death: <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Calvisius,</hi> anno 1285. <hi>ex Spang. Et Pantal. in Rodulpho Caesare.</hi>
                  </note> One Tylo Colupp, a notable juggler, sometime brought up at the Court, cunningly sowing together all the old shreds of his Courtship, and stretching them out with impudency, pretended to be Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick the Emperour, long detained in captivity in Palestine. The difference betwixt their aspects was easily reconciled; for few Physiognomy-marks are so deeply fixed in any face, but that age and misery will alter them. The credulity of the vulgar sort presently betrayed them to be couzened by him: yea, some Princes took this brasse for gold without touching it. But the best engine which gave this puppet his motion, was a bruit constantly buzzed, That Frederick was not dead. For Princes, the manner of whose deaths hath been private and obscure, fame commonly conjureth again out of their graves, and they walk abroad in the tongues and brains of many, who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm and beleeve them to be still alive. But the world soon surfeted of this cheaters forgerie; and this glow-worm when brought into the light, shined no more, but at Nanse was burnt to ashes by Rodulphus the Emperour.</p>
               <p>After Fredericks death there was an <hi>interregnum</hi> for three and twenty yeares in the Empire of Germany. True it is, that of some, William Earl of Holland (one without a beard, not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour) was nominated Emperour. The Spirituall electours chose Richard, brother to our King Henry the third. And as in Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall he got much coin, so Germany gave him a bottomlesse bag to put it in. A third party named Alphonse King of Castile, an admirable Mathematician: But the ointment of his name is marred with the dead flie of his Atheisticall speech, That if he had been in Gods stead, he could have framed the world bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then now it is. Notwithstanding, the best Dutch writers make an <hi>interregnum,</hi> as counting the Empire still a widow, and all these rather her suiters then any her husband.</p>
               <p>In like manner also in Palestine there was not any King for fourteen yeares after Fredericks death. The right indeed lay in Conrade Duke of Suevi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <head>Chap. 21. The Pastorells killed in France; King Lewis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home.</head>
               <p>GO we back to King Lewis, who all this while stayed in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine, busying himself partly in building and fensing of Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Cesarea, partly in composing discords betwixt the Pisans and Genoans, even proceeding to threaten them into agreement: But these armed men little cared for his naked me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing. He being also an excellent religious Antiquary and Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick on holy monuments, much employed himself in redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of old sacred places from the tyranny of time and oblivion.</p>
               <p>Mean time,<note place="margin">1251</note> in his Kingdome of France happened this strange accident; <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Being to shape their course into Palestine, they went into France; shewing they had a <hi>vertigo</hi> in their heads, mistaking the West for the East; or else, that like vagabonds they were never out of their way.</p>
               <p>The Holy Lambe was their ensigne, but their actions neither holy nor lambe-like. They pillaged and killed the poore Jews as they went (an unhappy nation, whose heads lie pat for every ones hands to hit, and their legges so stand in mens way that few can go by them without spurning at them:) Where they wanted Jews, they made Jews of Christians, especially if they were rich, using them with all cruelty. But at last neare Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux threescore thousand of them were slain, and the rest di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed.

               <p>LEwis is gone, and left the Christians in Syria in a wofull condition, without hope of amendment. Now, can any good come out of Tartary? Can the Northern wind blow a comfortable warmth? Yea; see a strange vicissitude of things! Haito the Christian King of Armenia had travelled to Mango the Cham of Tartary,<note place="margin">

He might expect onely this courtesie, to be last devoured.

Never since the time of Constantine the Great, did the devil at once lose a greater morsel, or was there made a more hopefull accession to the Faith.</p>
               <p>Understand we this conversion of Tartary (though Authours predicate it universally of that whole countrey) onely of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaia, the Eastern and most refined part of that Empire: For Cannibals were still in the North, who needed first to be converted to reason and to be made men, before they could become Christians.

               <head>Chap. 23. The discord betwixt the Genoans and Venetians, who burn the Genoans ships in Ptolemais.</head>
               <p>BUt they were unworthy of this happinesse, who would not be at leisure to make use of it, but busied themselves in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate dissensions, the Genoans against the Pisans and Venetians. These States (as many other in Italy) at this time were so proud in their Masters old clothes, they scarce knew themselves, grown brave with the feathers the Eagle had moulted, and set up by the breaking of the Emperour in Italy. The Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians and Genoans were hardly matched: The Pisans were not so strong, but as stomachfull as either of them, and then in this point of policie superiour to both; That first siding with the Genoans, they whipped the Venetians; then when they were sufficiently humbled, taking part with the Venetians, they strip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and lashed the Genoans: and the scales being even before, Pisa made that weigh down by course wherein she cast her grains.</p>
               <p>Now not content to fall out at home within the doores of Italy, they must fight in Syria in the open street, where the Turks looked on and laughed at them; counting it in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension as good sport as to see a spider poison a toad. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their old grudges transported hither out of Italy, this green wound was the cause of their dissension here: In Ptolemais these three States had their severall streets, severall markets for trading, and courts for causes both civill and criminall: but all three had one Church (that of S. Sabbas) common unto them, by the ordering of the Pope himself; who counted the same Church might serve the worshippers of the same God: But the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>So saith Blondus, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cad.</hi> 2 <hi>lib.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 308. <hi>But if we consult with Tyrius, lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 28. <hi>the Genoans and not the Venetians wonne Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais.</hi>
                  </note> Venetians by the vertue of an ancient agreement betwixt them and King Baldwine for their service in winning this city, challenged a peculiar interest therein. Hereabout was there old bustling; and in a tumult, the Genoans at that time surpassing for number, drave the Venetians out of the Church: Yea, Philip of Montfort, a French Governour of Ptolemais in the time of the <hi>interregnum,</hi> wanting not onely policie for a Magistrate, but wit for a man (Blondus <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Loco priùs citato.</hi>
                  </note> saith he was half-mad, and his actions speak him no lesse) compelled the Venetians generally to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake the city.</p>
               <p>Implacably incensed hereat, the Venetians arm thirteen galleys which they had at Tyre, &amp; coming to Ptolemais forced asunder the chain which crossed the haven, and burned five and twenty ships of the Genoans which lay there. For alas! being strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:21984:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the haven, they had no room (being intangled) to turn and free themselves one from another. And though united force be most forcible, yet not when so stifled and smothered that it cannot expresse and exercise it self. Many brave souldiers in these ships lost their lives in a bundle, without selling them, or ever opening their wares.</p>
               <p>To avenge this losse, the State of Genoa sent from home a navie of fifty ships of all sorts, which came to Tyre. There meet they with Reinerius Zenus Duke of Venice, with the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted power of the Venetians and Pisans, counting no fewer then seventy foure vessels well provided. They would have fought in the very haven of Tyre, but the Governour of the citie for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad it: It would be more scandalous to Christianity; The ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving fireballs might hurt the citie, and sinking ships hinder the harbour; Besides, the conquered party would probably com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of the partiality of the place, that it more favoured one side; They should not fight under his nose; if they had a mind to it, let them out and try their fortunes in the open sea.</p>

               <head>Chap. 24. The Genoan navie beaten by the Venetian; Sea and land-service compared, both in danger and honour.</head>
               <p>ACcordingly it was performed; out they go and fall to their work. Their galleys, like Ostriches, used their legges more then their wings, more running with oars then flying with sails. At that time, before Ordinance was found out, ships were both gunnes and bullets themselves, and furiously ranne one against another.</p>
               <p>They began with this arietation: Herein strength was much but not all; nimblenesse was also very advantageous to break and slent the down-right rushings of a stronger vessel. Then fell they to grappling: Here the steady ship had the better of it; and those souldiers who best kept their legges could best use their arms, the surest stander being alwayes the soundest striker. Much valour was shewed on both sides, and at last the victorie fell to the Venetian. The Genoans losing five and twenty of their ships, fled, and saved the rest in the haven of Tyre, after a most cruel and desperate battel.</p>
               <p>And surely, generally sea-fights are more bloudy then those on the land, especially since gunnes came up, whose shot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:21984:115" rendition="simple:additions"/>
wind and water (like those wounds so often mentioned in the Scripture under the fifth rib) is commonly observed mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall. Yea, farre harder it is for a ship, when arrested and ingaged in a battel, to clear it self, then for souldiers by land to save themselves by flight. Here neither his own two nor his horses foure legges can bestead any; but like accidents they must pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish with their subjects, and sink with their ship.</p>
               <p>And then why is a sea-victory lesse honour, being more dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, then one atchieved by land? Is it because sea-service is not so generall, nor so full of varieties, and the mysteries there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of sooner learned? or because in sea-fights fortune may seem to be a deeper sharer, and valour not so much interested? What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever it is, the laurel purchased on land hath a more lively ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure then that which is got at sea.</p>
               <p>We return to the Venetians: Who using or rather abusing this conquest, enter Ptolemais, cast out all Genoans thence, throw down their buildings both publick and private, demolish the fort which they had builded at S. Saba, rifle and spoil their shops, ware-houses and store houses: onely the Pope prevailed so farre with them, that they set at liberty the prisoners they had taken.</p>
               <p>Ten yeares did this warre last betwixt these two States in Syria, composed at last (saith my Authour) by the authority of Pope Clement the fourth, and by famine (the bad cause of a good effect) which in Palestine starved them into agreement. Longer these warres lasted betwixt them in Italy: their successe like the sea; they fought on ebbing and flowing. In this costly warre Pisa was first beggered; and for all her politick parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, Genoa at last trode so heavy upon her, that ever since she hath drooped and hung the wing, and at this day is maid to Florence, who formerly was mistresse of a good part of Italy. But I have no calling and lesse comfort to prosecute these bloudy dissensions: For warres of Christians against Infidels, are like the heat of exercise which serveth to keep the body of Christianity in health; but these civil warres amongst them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, like the heat of a feaver, dangerous, and destructive of religion.</p>

               <p>This honour was first offered to Lewis himself; but piety had dried up in him all ambitious humours: then to our Henry of England; but his warre-wasted purse could not stretch to the Popes price:<note place="margin">1265</note> At last, this Charles accepted it. But it is not for any speciall favour to the bush, if a man runne under it in a storm: it was no love to Charles, but to himself, to be sheltred from Maufred, that the Pope conferred this honour upon him. And the wife of Charles, that she might go in equipage with her three sisters, being Queens, sold all her <note n="*" place="margin">

warre. How-ever, one may question the truth of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, whether reall at first: This spring was too forward to hold; and the speedy withering of their religion argueth it wanted root. And as tame foxes, if they break loose and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn wild, do ten times more mischief then those which were wild from the beginning; so these renegadoes raged more fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously then any Pagans against religion. Guirboca sacrificed many Christians to the ghost of his nephew, destroyed Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarea and burnt it, using all cruelty against the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>Nor lesse were the Christians plagued at the same time with Bendocdar the Mammaluke Prince in Egypt; who succeeded Melechem, and every where raging against them, either killed or forced them to forswear their religion. The city of Joppa he took and burned;<note place="margin">1268.</note> and then wonne Antioch, slaying there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in twenty thousand, and carrying away captive an hundred thousand Christians. But it may justly be suspected that these numbers were written first in figures, and therefore at too much length, when the adding of nothing may increase many thousands.</p>
               <p>These wofull tidings brought into Europe, so wrought on the good disposition of Lewis King of France, that he resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to make a second voyage into Palestine to succour the Christians.</p>
               <p>He so fixed his mind on the journeys end, that he saw not the dangers in the way. His Counsel could not disswade, though they did disswade him. First, they urged, That he was old; let younger men take their turns: They recounted to him his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ill successe; How lately had that hot countrey scorched the lilies of France, not onely to the blasting of the leaves, but almost withering of the root? Besides, the sinews of the Christians in Syria were so shrunk, that though lifted up, they could not stand; That Nature decayed, but not thus whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destroyed, was the subject of physick; That the Turks had got a habit of conquering, and riveted themselves into the possession of the countrey; so that this voyage would but fleet the cream of the Kingdome to cast it into the fire.</p>
               <p>But as a vehement flame maketh feuel of whatsoever it meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; so this Kings earnest resolution turned bridles into spurres, and hindrances into motives to his journey. Was he old? let him make the more speed, lest envious death should prevent him of this occasion of honour. Had he sped ill formerly? he would seek his credit where he lost it: Surely, Fortunes lottery had not all blanks, but that after long drawing he should light on a prize at last. Were the Christians in so low a case? the greater need they had of speedy help.</p>
               <p>Thus was this good Kings judgement over-zealed. And
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:21984:117" rendition="simple:additions"/>
surely though Devotion be the naturall heat, Discretion (which wanted in him) is the radicall moisture of an action, keeping it healthfull, prosperous, and long-lived.</p>
               <p>Well, King Lewis will go, and to this end provideth his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vie; and is accompanied with Philip and Tristram his sonnes, Theobald King of Navarre his sonne in law, Alphonse his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Guido Earl of Flandres. There went also Edward eldest sonne to Henry King of England. It was a wonder he would now adventure his head when he was to receive a Crown, his father being full-ripe to drop down without ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering, having reigned longer then most men live, fifty and five yeares. But thirsty was this Edward of honour: Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shanks was he called; and as his strides were large, so vast and wide was the extent of his desire. As for his good father, he was content to let go the staff of his age for to be a prop to the Church. And though King Lewis was undiscreet in going this journey, he was wise in choosing this his companion, to have this active Prince along with him; it being good to eye a suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious person, and not to leave him behind.</p>
               <p>With Edward went his brother Edmund Earl of Lancaster, surnamed Crouch-back; not that he was crook-shouldered, or camel-backed: (From which our English Poet most zealously doth vindicate him;

                  <note place="margin">1270</note>LEwis now having hoised up sail, it was concluded by the generall consent of his Counsel, That to secure and clear the Christians passage to Palestine from pirates, they should first take the city of Carthage in Africa by the way.</p>
               <p>This Carthage long wrestled with Rome for the sovereignty,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:21984:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and gave as many foils as she took, till Scipio at last crushed out her bowels with one deadly fall. Yet long after the citie stood before wholly demolished, to be a spurre to put metall into the Romanes, and to be a forrein mark for their arrows, lest other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise they should shoot against themselves. At last by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel of Cato it was quite destroyed: who alledged, That it was not safe to have a knife so neare their throat; and though good use might be made of an enemy at arms end, yet it was dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to have him too close to ones side; as Carthage was within a dayes sail from Rome.</p>
               <p>Out of the ruines of this famous citie, Tunis arose; as often a stinking elder groweth out of the place where an oak hath been felled. Theeving was their trading: but then as yet they were Apprentises to piracie, whereof at this day they are grown Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters. Yea, not considerable was Tunis then in bignesse, great onely in mischief. But as a small scratch just upon the turning of a joynt is more troublesome then a bigger sore in another place; so this paltry town (the refuge of rogues, and wanderers home) seated in the passage betwixt Europe, Asia, and Africa, was a worse annoyance to Christian traffick then a whole countrey of Saracens elsewhere. Wherefore both to revenge the bloud of many Christians, who passing this way to Palestine were either killed or taken captive, as also to secure the way for the time to come, Lewis with his whole fleet (augmented with the navy of Charles King of Sicilie and Jerusalem, his brother) bent his course to besiege it.</p>
               <p>It was concluded both unnecessary and unfitting, first in a fair way to summon the city; because like pernicious vermine they were to be rooted out of the world by any means: nor was it meet to lavish the solemn ceremonies of warre on a company of theeves and murderers.</p>
               <p>The siege was no sooner begun but the plague seised on the Christian armie: whereof thousands died; amongst others, Tristram King Lewis his sonne: And he himself of a flux follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after.

                  <note place="margin">1271</note>BY this time Tunis was brought to great distresse, and at last on these conditions surrendred: That it should pay yearly to Charles King of Sicily and Jerusalem fourty thousand crowns; That it should receive Christian Ministers, freely to exercise their religion; If any Saracen would be baptized, he should be suffered; That all Christian captives should be set free; That they should pay back so much money as should defray the Christians charges in this voyage. Our Edward would needs have had the town beaten down, and all put to the sword; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foulest quarter too fair for them. Their goods (because got by robbery) he would have sacrificed as an <hi>anathema</hi> to God, and burnt to ashes: His own share he execrated, and caused it to be burnt, forbidding the English to save any thing of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that coals stolen out of that fire, would sooner burn their houses then warm their hands. It troubled not the consciences of other Princes to enrich themselves herewith, but they glutted themselves with the stolen hony which they found in this hive of drones: And which was worse, now their bellies were full they would go to bed, return home, and go no further. Yea, the young King of France, called Philip the Bold, was fearfull to prosecute his journey to Palestine; whereas Prince Edward struck his breast, and swore, That though all his friends forsook him, yet he would enter Ptolemais, though but onely with Fowin his horse-keeper. By which speech he incensed the English to go on with him.</p>

Besides, their navie was pursuivanted after with a horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble tempest, and a curse (entailed either on their ill-gotten goods, or deserting Gods cause, or both) arrested them in their return: so that of this great wealth little was landed in Europe, their ships being wracked, &amp; the goods therein cast into the sea; with which the waves played a little, and then chopped them up at a morsel. Whilest the weather frowning on them, smiled on the English, Prince Edward no whit damnified either in his men or ships, with Elenor his tender consort then young with child, safely arrived at Ptolemais, to the great solace and comfort of the Christians there being in great distresse.</p>

               <p>AT his arrivall the last stake of the Christians was on losing: For Bendocdar the Mammaluke Prince of Egypt and Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, had brought Ptolemais to so low an ebbe, that they therein resolved (if some unexpected succour reversed not their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions) within three dayes to resigne the city unto him.

               <p>And now those who before in despair would have thrown up their cards, hope at least to make a saving game; and the Christians taking comfort and courage, both defie their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and their own thoughts of surrendring the citie. Prince Edward having sufficiently manned and victualled Ptolemais, taking six or seven thousand souldiers, marched to Nazareth; which he took, and slew those he found there. After this, about midsummer, understanding the Turks were gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at Cakhow fourty miles off, very early in the morning he set upon them, slew a thousand, and put the rest to flight.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:21984:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>In these skirmishes he gave evident testimonies of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonall valour: Yea, in cold bloud he would boldly challenge any Infidel to a duell. To speak truth, this his conceived per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection was his greatest imperfection: For the world was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly satisfied in the point of his valour; yet such was his confidence of his strength, and eagernesse of honour, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving merited the esteem of a most stout man, he would still supererogate: yea, he would profer to fight with any mean person, if cried up by the <hi>volge</hi> for a tall man: this daring being a generall fault in great spirits, and a great fault in a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, who staketh a pearl against a piece of glasse. The best was, in that age a man fighting with sword and buckler, had in a manner many lives to lose; and duells were not dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
               <p>Whilest he stayed at Ptolemais, Elenor his Lady was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered of a fair daughter, called from her birth-place Joan of Acres: But fear of her husbands death abated her joy at her daughters birth. The Turks not matching him in valour, thought to master him with treachery, which was thus contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: The Admirall of Joppa, a Turk, pretended he would turn Christian, and imployed one Anzazim an Assasine in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sinesse betwixt him and Prince Edward; who carried himself so cunningly, that by often repairing to our Prince he got much credit and esteem with him.</p>

But sure, so cunning a companion had long conversed with light, and been acquainted with men, yea, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians and Princes, as appeareth by his complying carriage; else, if he had not been well read in their company, he could not have been so perfect in his lesson.

And though she cried out and wrung her hands, Madame, said they, be contented; it is better that one woman should weep a little while then that all the realm of England should lament a great season: And so they conducted her out of the place. And the Prince, by the benefit of physick, good atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and an antidote the Master of the Templars gave him, shewed himself on horse-back whole and well within fifteen dayes after.</p>

               <p>Whosoever plotted, God prevented it, and the Christians there would have revenged it, but Edward would not suffer them. In all haste they would have marched and fallen on the Turks, had not he <note n="*" place="margin">

What musick can one string make when all the rest are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken? what could Edward do alone, when those Princes fell back on whom the project most relied? Lewis and Charles were the main undertakers; Edward entertained but as an adventurer and sharer: and so he furnished himself accordingly, with competent forces to succour others, but not to subsist of themselves. But as too often, where the principall miscarrieth, the second &amp; sureties must lie at the stake to make the debt good: so in their default he valiantly went forward, though having in all but thirteen ships and some thousands of men (too many for a plain Prince to visit with, and too few for a great one to warre with) and performed what lay within the compasse of his power.

And though this was but an old policie, To send the Emperours far away, that so he might command in chief in their absence; yet his Holinesse did so turn and dresse this threed-bare plot with specious pretenses of piety, that it passed for new and fresh, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to those that beheld it at distance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But Rodulphus could not be spared out of Germany, being there imployed in civil dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords: The knees of the Dutch Princes were too stiff to do him homage, till he softned them by degrees. And indeed he was not provided for the Holy warre, and wanted a stock of his own to drive so costly a trade, having no paternall lands considerable, no bottom to begin on; though through his thrift and providence he first laid the foundation of the Austrian familie.</p>
               <p>Yet somewhat to answer expectation,<note place="margin">1275</note> he sent Henry Duke of Mechlenburg with competent forces into Palestine: Who coming to Ptolemais, made many notable incursions into the countrey a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Damasco, with fire &amp; sword destroying all as he went, &amp; car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying thence many rich booties; till at last he was circumvented and taken prisoner by the Mammalukes. Twenty six yeares he li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in captivity, keeping his conscience free all the while: At last the Sultan of Egypt (a renegado Germane, who formerly had been engineer to this Dukes father) set him at liberty, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Martine his servant; that he who so long had shared of his misery, might also partake of his happinesse. No sooner had this Duke put to sea, but he was again taken by pirates; and the Sultan, out of pity to this distressed Prince, and out of scorn that fortune should frustrate and defeat his reall courtesie, set him free again. At last he came safely home, and was there welcomed with as much wonder as joy; his subjects conceiving his return a resurrection, having buried him in their thoughts long before.</p>
               <p>Here he found <note n="*" place="margin">

               <head>Chap. 31. Charles King of Ierusalem; His intentions in Syria stopped by the Sicilian Vespers; His death, and sonnes succession.</head>
               <p>BY this time Charles King of Jerusalem and Sicily had made great preparations for the Holy warre. And to make his claim to the Kingdome of Jerusalem the stronger, he bought also the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of Maria Domicella Princesse of Antioch, which pretended a right to the same. He sent also Roger the Count of S. Severine as his Vice-roy to Ptolemais: where he was honourably received in despite of Hugh King of Cyprus, by the especiall favour of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertine Morisine the Venetian Consul there. And now his navie was reported to be readie, and that by the way he had a project upon Michael Paleologus the Emperour of Greece: When all his intentions were suddenly blasted; it so happening, that on Easter day, as the bell tolled to Even-song, all the throats of the French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in Sicily were cut in a moment by the natives thereof, and that Island wonne by Peter King of Aragon. The grand contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of this massacre was one Jacobus Prochyta a Physician; and I dare say he killed more in an houre then he cured all his life-time.</p>
               <p>Those that condemn the Sicilians herein, cannot excuse the French; such formerly had been their pride, lust, covetousnesse, and cruelty to the people of that Island, putting them causelessely to exquisite torture, so that an ordinary hanging was counted an extraordinary favour. But the secrecie of contriving this slaughter of the French was little lesse then miraculous; that so many knowing it, none should discover it; like cunning dogs, barking in triumph after they had bitten, not before, to give any warning.<note place="margin">1282</note> Hence grew the proverb of <hi>the Sicilian Vespers</hi>; though their Even-song was nothing to the English Mattens intended in the Gunpowder-treason. Mean time King Charles was at Rome, beholding the making of Cardinals, when this dolefull news was brought unto him, and struck him to the heart. He sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived a yeare or two longer, but dull and melancholick, living as it were without life, and died at last, having reigned King of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem twenty yeares. A Prince which had tasted of various suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cesse; fortune for a while smiling on him, and at last laughing at him.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1284</note>His sonne Charles succeeded him in the Kingdome of Naples and in the title of Jerusalem. He was surnamed <hi>Cunctator,</hi> Delayer; not in the same sense as Fabius the Shield of Rome was so called: he onely stayed till opportunity was come; our Charles, till it was passed. I find nothing memorable of him except this, That
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:21984:122" rendition="simple:additions"/>
offended with the Templars in Palestine for taking part against him with the King of Cyprus, he seised on their lands, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scated all their goods they had in Naples or any other part of his dominions. How-ever, let him have room in the catalogue of our Kings of Jerusalem. For as high hills neare the sea-side, though otherwise never so base and barren ground, yet will serve to be sea-marks for the direction of mariners: so this Charles, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Hugh, John, and Henry, Kings of Cyprus, pretending also to Jerusalem, though we reade nothing remarkable of them, will become the front of a page, and serve to divide and distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish times, and to parcel the history the better to our apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion.

               <p>BUt whilest these titular Kings slept, the Mammaluke Princes were vigilant to infest the reliques of the Christians in Pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine: Which Princes succession we will adventure to set down; nor are we discouraged with the difficulties which encounter us herein. The hardnesse in the story of the Mammalukes proceedeth (as we conceive) from one of these causes: First, the State is not written directly, but by reflexion; not storied by any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant writer of their own, but in snaps and parcels, as the Chroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clers of neighbouring Christian countreys have catched at them. Secondly, out of a popular errour, their chief Captains by reason of their large authority passe for absolute Kings. Thirdly, the same King hath many names, and the same name by translation in sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry languages is strangely disguised. How-ever, we will use our best conjectures in these uncertainties: and a dimme candle is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then no light.</p>
               <p>Bendocdar or Bandodacar, otherwise Melechdaer, was the last Egyptian Prince we mentioned.

Some wholly omit him; enough to make us su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that he was onely some Deputy clapped in to stop up the vacancie till Melechsaites was chosen.</p>
               <p>Melechsaites (called by Marinus, Melechmessor) wonne the strong castle of Mergath from the Hospitallers. He much loved and was very bountifull to the Carmelites, who lived dispersed in Syria:<note place="margin">1285</note> but afterwards he banished them out of his countrey, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they altered their habit, and wore white coats at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Pope Honorius; the Turks being generally enemies to innovations, and loving constancy in old customes. Nor was this any mishap but an advantage to the Carmelites, to lose their dwellings in Syria, and gain better in Europe, where they planted themselves in the fattest places: So that he who knoweth not to choose good ground, let him find out an house of the Carme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites (a mark that faileth not) for his direction.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1289</note>Alphir was next to Melechsaites, otherwise called Elsi. He per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that now or never was the time finally to expell the Christians out of Palestine, whilest the Princes in Europe were in civil warres, besieged and wonne Tripoli, Sidon, Berytus, and Tyre, beating them down to the ground, but suffering the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants on some conditions to depart. Nothing now was left but Ptolemais: which Alphir would not presently besiege, lest he should draw the Christians in Europe upon him; but concluded a peace for five yeares with the Venetians, as not willing wholly to exasperate them by winning all from them at once, and think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this bitter potion would be better swallowed by them at two severall draughts.</p>
               <p>Mean time Ptolemais was in a wofull condition. In it were some of all countreys; so that he who had lost his nation, might find it here. Most of them had severall courts to decide their causes in; and the plenty of Judges caused the scarcity of justice, malefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctours appealing to a triall in the courts of their own countrey. It was sufficient innocency for any offender in the Venetian court, that he was a Venetian. Personall acts were entituled nationall, and made the cause of the countrey. Outrages were every-where practised, no-where punished; as if to spare Divine revenge the pains of overtaking them, they would go forth and meet it. At the same time, they were in fitters about prosecuting their titles to this city, no fewer then the Venetians, Genoans, Pisans, Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentines, the Kings of Cyprus and Sicily, the Agents for the Kings of France and England, the Princes of Tripoli and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, the Masters of the Templars
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:21984:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and Hospitallers, and (whom I should have named first) the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate of his Holinesse, all at once with much violence contending about the right of right nothing, the title to the Kingdome of Jerusalem, and command of this city; like bees, making the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est humming and buzzing in the hive when now ready to leave it.</p>

               <p>WIthin the city were many voluntaries lately come over, five hundred whereof were of the Popes furnishing. But belike he failed afterwards in his payment to them, the golden tide flowing not so fast out as into his Holinesse coffers. The soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers being not payed, according to their blunt manners, would pay themselves; and marching out, pillaged the countrey contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the truce: Sultan Serapha (who succeeded Alphir) demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing restitution, is denied, and his Embassadours ill intreated.</p>
               <p>Hereupon he sitteth down before the city with six hundred thousand men.<note place="margin">1290</note> But we are not bound to beleeve that Alexanders souldiers were so big as their shields speak them which they left in India, nor Asian armies so numerous as they are reported. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Turks dominions spacious and populous, and that they rather drained then chose souldiers; yet we had best credit the most niggardly writers, which make them an hundred and fifty thousand. Serapha resolveth to take it, conceiving so convenient a purchase could not be over-bought: The place, though not great, yet was a mote in the eye of the Turkish Empire, and therefore pained them.</p>
               <p>Peter Belvise Master of the Templars, a valiant Captain, had the command of the city assigned him by generall consent. He encouraged the Christians to be valiant, not like prodigall heirs to lose this city for nothing which cost their grandfathers so much bloud; at least let them give one blaze of valour ere their candle went out. How should they shew their friends their faces, if they shewed their foes their backs! Let them fight it out man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully; that so, if forced at last to surrender it, they might rather be pitied for want of fortune then justly blamed for lack of valour.</p>
               <p>And now Ptolemais being to wrestle her last fall, stripped her self of all cumbersome clothes: women, children, aged persons, weak folks (all such hindering help, and mouthes without arms) were sent away; and twelve thousand remained, conceived com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to make good the place.</p>
               <p>Serapha marcheth up furiously; his men assault the city, with open jaws ready to devoure it, had not their mouthes been stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped with the artillery the Christians shot at them. Back they
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:21984:123" rendition="simple:additions"/>
were beaten, and many a Turk slain. But Serapha was no whit sensible thereof: who willingly would lose a thousand men in a morning for a breakfast, double so many at a dinner, and continue this costly ordinary for some dayes together; yea, in spite he would spend an ounce of Turkish bloud, to draw a drop of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian.</p>
               <p>In this conflict Peter Belvise was slain with a poisoned arrow: A losse above grieving for. Many were strong in desiring the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour who were weak to discharge the office. But the worst mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief was; the Christians were divided amongst themselves, and neglected to defend the citie, conceiving that though that was taken, yet every particular nation could defend it self, having their buildings severally fortified: And this dangerous fansie took off their thoughts from the publick good, and fixed them on their private ends. Mean time, the Patriarch of Jerusalem, and others (some name with them Henry King of Jerusalem and Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus) more seeking their safety then honour, secretly fled (with their bodies after their hearts) out of the city; and some of them shunning a noble death, fell on a base end, being drowned in the sea. Their cowardlinesse is imputed by some Authours to all the rest; whereas it appeareth on the contrary, they most vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly behaved themselves.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">1291</note>At last, the Turks entred the city by undermining the walls, and conceived their work now done, when it was new begun. For they found Ptolemais not a city, but a heap of cities thrown together: wherein the people of every countrey so fensed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their severall forts, that they powdered the Turks with their shot when they entred the streets. It is hardly to be paralleled in any siege, that a taken city was so long before it was taken: for it held out fifty dayes; and the Knights-Hospital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers made good their castle for <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lampad. Mellif. hist. part.</hi> 3. <hi>pag.</hi> 313.</note> two whole moneths together. But alas! as the severall parts of <hi>Insecta</hi> being cut asunder, may wriggle and stirre a while, not live long; so these divided limbes could not long subsist, and at last most of them were slain.</p>
               <p>Yet was it a bloudy victory to the Turks; most of them that entred the city being either burned with fire, or killed with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, or smothered with the fall of towres, the very ruines (as thirsty of revenge) killing those that ruined them.</p>
               <p>Serapha evened all to the ground, and (lest the Christians should ever after land here) demolished all buildings; the Turks holding this position, That the best way to be rid of such ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, is to shave the hair clean off, and to destroy all places wherein they may nestle themselves.</p>
               <p>Some say, he plowed the ground whereon the city stood, and sowed it with corn: but an <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sand. Trav. pag.</hi> 204.</note> eye-witnesse affirmeth, that still there remain magnificent ruines, seeming rather wholly to consist
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:21984:124" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of divers conjoyned castles, then any way intermingled with pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate dwellings.</p>
               <p>No fewer then an hundred thousand Latine Christians (all that were left in Syria) fled at this time into Cyprus. It is strange what is reported, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lampad. pag.</hi> 312.</note> That above five hundred matrones and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins of noble bloud, standing upon the shore of Ptolemais, and having all their richest jewels with them, cried out with lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table voice, and profered to any mariner that would undertake safely to land them any-where, all their wealth for his hire, and also that he should choose any one of them for his wife. Then a certain mariner came, and transporting them all freely, safely landed them in Cyprus; nor by any enquiry could it after be known (when he was sought for to receive his hire) who this mariner was, nor whither he went.</p>
               <p>The Hospitallers for haste were fain to leave their treasure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, and hide it in a vault; which being made known from time to time to their successours, was fetched from thence by the <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sand. Trav. pag.</hi> 204.</note> galleys of Malta about three hundred yeares afterwards.</p>
               <p>Henry King of Cyprus to his great cost and greater com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, gave free entertainment to all Pilgrimes that fled hither, till such time as they could be transported to their own countreys; and thanks was all the shot expected of these guests at their departure.</p>
               <p>Thus after an hundred ninety and foure yeares ended the Holy warre; for continuance the longest, for money spent the cost<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liest, for bloudshed the cruellest, for pretenses the most pious, for the true intent the most politick the world ever saw. And at this day, the Turks to spare the Christians their pains of coming so long a journey to Palestine, have done them the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcome courtesie, to come more then half the way to give them a meeting.</p>

The historie thereof is but in twilight, not clearly delivered, but darkened with many doubts and difficulties: We must pick out letters and syllables here and there as well as we may; all which put together spell thus much.</p>
               <p>Pope Clement having long sojourned in France, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived many reall courtesies from Philip the King; yea, he owed little lesse then himself to him. At last, Philip requested of him a boon, great enough for a King to ask and a Pope to grant; namely, all the lands of the Knights Templars through
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:21984:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
France, forfeited by reason of their horrible heresies and licentious living. The Pope was willing to gratifie him in some good proportion for his favours received (as thankfulnesse is alwayes the badge of a good nature) and therefore being thus long the Kings guest, he gave him the Templars lands and goods to pay for his entertainment.</p>
               <p>On a sudden all the Templars in France they clapt into pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, wisely catching those Lions in a net, which had they been fairly hunted to death, would have made their part good with all the dogs in France. Damnable sinnes were laid to their charge; as, sacrificing of men to an idol they worshipped, rosting of a Templars bastard and drinking his bloud, spitting upon the crosse of Christ, conspiring with Turks and Saracens against Christianitie, Sodomie, bestialitie, with many other villanies out of the rode of humane corruption, and as farre from mans nature as Gods law.</p>
               <p>Well; the Templars thus shut in prison, their crimes were half-proved. The sole witnesse against them was one of their own Order, a notorious malefactour; who at the same time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in prison and to suffer for his own offenses, condemned by the Master of their Order, sought to prove his own innocency by charging all his own Order to be guiltie. And his case stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus, he must either kill or be killed, die or put others to death, he would be sure to provide water enough to drive the mill, and swore most heartily to whatsoever was objected against the Order. Besides, the Templars being brought upon the rack, confessed the accusations to be true wherewith they were charged. Hereupon all the Templars through France were most cruelly burned to death at a stake, with James the grand Master of their Order.</p>

               <head>Chap. 2. Arguments produced on either side, both for the innocencie and guiltinesse of the Templars.</head>
               <p>THere is scarce a harder question in later historie then this, Whether the Templars justly or unjustly were condemned to suffer. On the one side, it is dangerous to affirm they were innocent, because condemned by the Pope, infallible in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of such consequence. This bugbear affrighteth many, and maketh their hands shake when they write hereof. If they should say the Templars were burned wrongfully, they may be fetched over the coals themselves for charging his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:21984:125" rendition="simple:additions"/>
so deeply; yea, hereby they bring so much innocent bloud on the Popes head as is enough to drown him: Some therefore in this matter know little, and dare speak lesse, for fear of after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claps. Secondly, some who suspect that one eye of the Church may be dimme, yet hold that both the eyes, the Pope and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councel together, cannot be deceived.</p>
               <p>Now the Councel of Vienne countenanced the exstirpation of the Templars, determined the dissolution of their Order, and adjudged their lands to be conferred on the Knights-Hospital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers. Men ought then to be well advised how they condemn a generall Councel to be accessorie <hi>post factum</hi> to the murder of so many men.</p>
               <p>For all this, those who dare not hollow, do whisper on the other side, accounting the Templars not malefactours but martyrs: First, because the witnesse was unsufficient, a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factour against his Judge; and secondly, they bring tortured men against themselves. Yea, there want not those that maintain that a confession extorted on the rack is of no validitie. If they be weak men and unable to endure torment, they will speak any thing; and in this case their words are endited not from their heart but outward limbes that are in pain: and a poore conquest it is, to make either the hand of a child to beat, or the tongue of the tortured man to accuse himself. If they be sturdie and stubborn, whose backs are paved against torments, such as bring brasen sides against steely whips, they will confesse nothing. And though these Templars were stout &amp; valiant men, yet it is to be commended to ones consideration, whether slavish and servile souls will not better bear torment, then generous spirits, who are for the enduring of honourable danger and speedie death, but not provided for torment, which they are not acquainted with, neither is it the proper object of valour.</p>
               <p>Again, it is produced in their behalf, that being burned at the stake, they denied it at their death, though formerly they had confessed it; and whose charitie, if not stark-blind, will not be so tender-eyed as to beleeve that they would not breathe out their soul with a lie, and wilfully contract a new guilt in that very instant wherein they were to be arraigned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judge of heaven.

               <p>Moreover, the people with their suffrage acquitted them: happie was he that could get an handfull of their ashes into his bosome, as the Relique of pious martyrs, to preserve.

                  <item>2. Surely many of them were most hainous offenders. Not to speak what they deserved from God (who needeth not pick a quarrel with man, but alwayes hath a just controversie with him) they are accounted notorious transgressours of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane laws: yet perchance if the same candle had been lighted to search, as much dust and dirt might have been found in other Orders.</item>

                  <item>4. The chief cause of their ruine was their extraordinary wealth: They were feared of many, envied of more, loved of none. As Naboths vineyard was the chiefest ground for his blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemie; and as in England, <note n="*" place="margin">

right valiantly clean through the Holy warre: And, which foundeth much to their honour, they cannot be touched either for treason or faction, but were both loyall and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the whole service.</p>
               <p>But at last they perceived, that by the course of the cards they must needs rise losers if they continued the warre in the Holy land, and even resolved to abandon it. It happened at the same time, that Conrade Duke of Mazovia offered them most honourable conditions; namely, the enjoying of Prussia, on condition they would defend it against the Infidels which annoyed it. Indeed the <hi>fratres gladiferi,</hi> or sword-bearing brothers, brave slashing lads, undertook that task: but finding either their arms too weak, or swords too blunt to strike through their enemies, they imployed the aid of, and conjoyned themselves to this Teutonick Order. Hereupon, in the yeare of our Lord 1239, Hermannus de Saltza, fourth Master of these Dutch Knights, came with most of his Order into Prus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sia; yet so that he left a competent number of them still in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestine, which continued and did good service there even to the taking of Ptolemais.</p>
               <p>But the greater number of these Dutch Knights, in Prussia did knight-service against the Tartarians, and were Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes best bank against the inundations of those barbarous people. By their endeavours the Prussians, which before were but heathen-Christians, were wholly converted; many a brave citie builded, specially Marienburg, where formerly a great oak stood; (who would think so many beautifull build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings would spring out of the root of one tree?) and those countreys of Prussia and Livonia, which formerly were the course list, are now become the rich fringe of Europe.</p>
               <p>At last the Prussians grew weary of the tyrannous oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of those Dutch Knigh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

He took to task Lewis Erlinsufe the Master of their Order; and so ordered him, that whereas before he pleaded himself to be a free Prince of the Empire, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after he should acknowledge the King of Poland for his Lord and Master. The successours to this Lewis fretted against this agreement, as prejudiciall to them: They could do no lesse then complain, and could do little more; for the King of Poland in spite of their resistance held them to their agreements.</p>
               <p>Albert of the house of Brandenburg was the last grand Master of this Order, and first Duke of Prussia. He brake the vow of their Order, losing his virginitie to keep his chastitie, and married Dorothie daughter to the King of Denmark.

And thus in this Albert, for ought we can find to the contrarie, the Teutonick Order had its end, and was quite dissolved.</p>

               <head>Chap. 5. The severall flittings of the Knights-Hospitallers, from Cyprus, by Rhodes, Nice, Syracuse, to Malta.</head>
               <p>WE must now wait on the Hospitallers to their lodgings, and we have done. We left them driven from Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais, and landed at Cyprus; where King Henry courteously en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained them. But a friends house is no home: Hence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were conveyed to their severall Alberges in Europe.</p>
               <p>But such active spirits could not long be idle; such running streams would not end in a standing pond. Wherefore they used all their own strength, and improved their interest with all their benefactours, to furnish out a fleet: Which done, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Fulk de Vilderet their grand Master they wonne the Island of Rhodes from the Turks eighteen yeares after Ptolemais was lost, and there seated themselves.</p>
               <p>Besides Rhodes, they also enjoyed these five adjacent Islands, saith my Authour, Nicoria, Episcopia, Iolli, Limonia, and Sirana; places so small, that consulting with maps will not find them out: enough almost to make us think with Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian of Delos, that once there were such Islands, which at this day are quite vanished away.</p>
               <p>Two hundred and fourteen yeares, to the terrour of the Turks, comfort of the Christians, and their own immortall fame, they maintained this Island, and secured the seas for the passage of Pilgrimes to Jerusalem: till at last in the yeare 1523, after six moneths siege they surrendred the citie to their own honour, and shame of other Christians who sent them no suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour in season.</p>
               <p>Yet changing their place they kept their resolution to be honourably imployed. Hence they sailed to Nice in Piemont, a citie lying opposite to Africa, from whence the Moores and Saracens much infested Christendome. Wherefore Charles Duke of Savoy bestowed that citie upon them to defend it;
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:21984:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
counting the courtesie rather done to him then by him, that they would accept it.</p>
               <p>Afterwards, they perceived it was more needfull to stop the Turks invasions then their pillagings: They had lately wonne Buda, and (as it was thought) would quickly stride over the Adriatick sea, and have at Italie. Wherefore the Hospitallers left Nice, and planted themselves at Syracuse in Sicilie: Where they right valiantly behaved themselves in defending that countrey.</p>
               <p>But Charles the fifth, a politick Prince, though he saw their help was usefull, yet desired not much to have them live in his own countrey. He liked their neighbourhood better then their presence, to have them rather neare then in his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome. Wherefore he appointed them the Island of Malta to keep for themselves, their grand Master onely paying yearly to the King of Spain a <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Malta is an Island in the mid-land-sea, seated betwixt Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope and Africa, as if it meant to escape out of both as being in neither. Here S. Paul suffered shipwrack, when the viper stung him not, but the men did, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 28.4.</note> condemning him for a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer. And here the Hospitallers seated themselves, and are the bulwark of Christendome to this day, giving dayly evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proof of their courage. But their master-piece was in the yeare 1565, when they couragiously defended the citie of Malta besieged by Soliman: When he discharged seventie eight thousand bullets (some of them seven spans in compasse) against it, big enough not onely to overthrow walls but overturn mountains; yet notwithstanding they held out valiant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly five moneths, and at last forced the Turk to depart.</p>

the Kings spirit, that like a torrent it would bear down any thing which stood betwixt him and his desires; If his anger were once inflamed, nothing but their bloud could quench it: Let them not flatter themselves into their own ruine, by relying on the aid of their friends at home, who would not substitute their own necks to save theirs from the ax; nor by hoping for help from forrein parts, who could send them no seasonable succour.</p>
               <p>This counsel harsh at first, grew tunable in the eares of the Hospitallers; so that contented rather to exchange their clothes for worse then to be quite stript, they resigned all into the Kings hands.

And at this time, many had Danae's happinesse, to have golden showres rained into their bosomes.</p>
               <p>These Abbey-lands, though skittish mares to some, have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven good milk to others: Which is produced as an argument, That if they prove unsuccessefull to any, it is the users default, no inherencie of a curse in the things themselves.

Some outrages were committed in the manner of these dissolutions: Many manuscripts, guiltie of no other superstition then red letters in the front, were condemned to the fire: and here a principall key of antiquitie was lost, to the great prejudice of posteritie.

               <head>Chap. 9. Observations on the Holy warre; The horrible superstition therein.</head>
               <p>WE have finished the story of the Holy warre: And now I conceive my indentures are cancelled, and I dischar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the strict service and ties of an Historian; so that it may be lawfull for me to take more libertie, and to make some observations on what hath been past.</p>
               <p>Before I go further, I must deplore the worlds losse of that worthy work which the Lord Verulam left unfinished, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Holy warre; an excellent piece, and alas! it is but a piece: so that in a pardonable discontent we may almost wish that either it had been more, wholly to have satisfied our hunger, or lesse, not at all to have raised our appetite. It was begun not in an historicall but in a politick way, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the Holy warre past with the Turks but advising how to manage it in the future. And no doubt if he had perfected the work, it would have proved worthy the Authour: But since, any have been deterred from finishing the same; as ashamed to adde mud-walls and a thatched roof to so fair a foundation of hewen and polished stone.</p>
               <p>From that Authour we may borrow this distinction, That three things are necessarie to make an invasive warre lawfull; the lawfulnesse of the jurisdiction, the merit of the cause, and the orderly and lawfull prosecution of the cause. Let us apply to our present purpose in this Holy warre: For the first two, Whether the jurisdiction the Christians pretended over the Turks dominions was lawfull or not; and, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this warre was not onely <hi>operae</hi> but <hi>vitae pretium,</hi> worth the losing so many lives; we referre the Reader to what
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:21984:131" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hath been said in the <note n="*" place="margin">Chap. 9, and 10.</note> first book. Onely it will not be amisse, to adde a storie or two out of an <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Froissard, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 18, 19.</note> Authour of good account. When Charles the sixth was King of France, the Duke of Burbant sailed over into Africa with a great armie, there to fight against the Saracens. The Saracen Prince sent an herald to know of him the cause of his coming: The Duke answered, it was to revenge the death of Christ the Sonne of God, and true Prophet, whom they had unjustly crucified. The Saracens sent back their messenger again to demonstrate their innocencie, how they were not Saracens but Jews which put Christ to death, and therefore that the Christians (if posteritie should be punished for their predecessours fault) should rather revenge themselves on the Jews which lived amongst them.</p>
               <p>

                     <hi>Monstrell. lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 68.</note> Another relateth, that in the yeare of our Lord 1453, the great Turk sent a letter to the Pope, advertising him how he and his Turkish nation were not descended from the Jews, but from the Trojans, from whom also the Italians derive their pedegree, and so would prove himself a-kinne to his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse. Moreover he added, that it was both his and their dutie to repair the ruines of Troy, and to revenge the death of their great grand-father Hector upon the Grecians; to which end, the Turk said he had already conquered a great part of Greece. As for Christ, he acknowledged him to have been a noble Prophet, and to have been crucified of the Jews, against whom the Christians might seek their remedie. These two stories I thought good to insert, because though of later date, and since the Holy warre in Palestine was end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet they have some reference thereunto, because some make that our quarrel to the Turks.</p>
               <p>But grant the Christians right to the Turks lands to be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and the cause in it self enough deserving to ground a warre upon: yet in the prosecuting and managing thereof, many not onely veniall errours but unexcusable faults were committed; no doubt, the cause of the ill successe.</p>
               <p>To omit the book called the Office of our Lady, made at the beginning of this warre to procure her favourable assistance in it (a little manual, but full of blasphemies in <hi>folio,</hi> thrust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her with importunate superstitions into Gods throne, and forcing on her the glory of her Maker;) superstition not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tainted the rind, but rotted the core of this whole action. Indeed most of the pottage of that age tasted of that wild gourd. Yet farre be it from us to condemn all their works to be drosse, because debased and allayed with superstitious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents: No doubt there was a mixture of much good metall in them, which God the good refiner knoweth how to sever, and
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:21984:132"/>
then will crown and reward. But here we must distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt those deeds which have some superstition in them, and those which in their nature are wholly superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, such as this Voyage of people to Palestine was. For what opinion had they of themselves herein, who thought that by dying in this warre, they did make Christ amends for his death? as one saith: Which if but a rhetoricall flourish, yet doth hyperbolize into blasphemie. Yea, it was their very judgement, that hereby they did both merit and su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pererogate; and by dying for the Crosse, crosse the score of their own sinnes and score up God for their debtour. But this flieth high, and therefore we leave it for others to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low. Let us look upon Pilgrimages in generall, and we shall find Pilgrimes wandring not so farre from their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey as from the judgement of the ancient Fathers.</p>
               <p>We will leave our armie at home, and onely bring forth our champion: Heare what <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epist. seu Orat. de iis qui adeunt Hierosol. Edit. Gr. Lat. Parisiis,</hi> 1615.</note> Gregorie Nyssene saith, who lived in the fourth Centurie, in which time voluntary Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages first began; though before there were necessarie Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimes, forced to wander from their countrey by persecution. Where, saith he, our Lord pronounceth men blessed, he reckoneth not going to Jerusalem to be amongst those good deeds which direct to happinesse. And afterwards, speaking of the going of single-women in those long travels; A woman; saith he, cannot go such long journeys without a man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct her; and then whatsoever we may suppose, whether she hireth a stranger or hath a friend to wait on her, on neither side can she escape reproof, and keep the law of continencie. Moreover; If there were more Divine grace in the places of Jerusalem, sinne would not be so frequent and customarie amongst those that live there: Now there is no kind of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse which there they dare not commit; malice, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, thefts, idolatrie, poysonings, envies and slaughters. But you will say unto me, If it be not worth the pains, why then did you go to Jerusalem? Let them heare therefore how I defend my self: I was appointed to go into Arabia to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Councel, held for the reforming of that Church: and Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bia being neare to Jerusalem, I promised those that went with me, that I would go to Jerusalem to discourse with them which were presidents of the churches there; where matters were in a very troubled state, and they wanted one to be a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour in their discords. We knew that Christ was a man born of a Virgin, before we saw Bethlehem; we beleeved his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection from death, before we saw his sepulchre; we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed his ascension into heaven, before we saw mount Olivet: But we got so much profit by our journey, that by comparing

them, we found <note n="*" place="margin">

Change of place maketh not God nearer unto us: wheresoever thou art, God will come to thee, if the Inne of thy soul be found such, as the Lord may dwell and walk in thee, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A patrone of Pilgrimages not able to void the blow yet willing to break the stroke of so pregnant and plain a testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie, thus seeketh to ward it; That indeed Pilgrimages are unfitting for women, yet fitting for men. But sure God never appointed such means to heighten devotion necessary thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, whereof the half of mankind (all women) are by their very creation made uncapable.</p>
               <p>Secondly, he pleadeth, That it is lawfull for secular and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to go on Pilgrimages, but not for Friars, who lived re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluse in their cells, out of which they were not to come: and against such (saith he) is Nyssens speech directed. But then, I pray, what was Peter, the leader of this long dance, but an Hermite? and (if I mistake not) his profession was the very dungeon of the Monasticall prison, the strictest and severest of all other Orders. And though there were not so many cowls as helmets in this warre, yet alwayes was the Holy armie well stocked with such cattel: So that on all sides it is confessed that the Pilgrimages of such persons were utterly unlawfull.</p>

I know something he pretended herein to defend himself, but of no validitie; and such plausible and curious wittie evasions to avoyd perjurie, are but the tying of a most artificiall knot in the halter, therewith to strangle ones own conscience.</item>

                  <item>4. Our Richard, at his departure from Palestine, made a firm peace for five yeares with Saladine, and it stood yet in force when Henry Duke of Saxonie coming with a great armie of new adventurers invaded the Turkish dominions.</item>
                  <item>5. Frederick the second, Emperour, made a truce of ten yeares with the Sultan of Babylon; and yet in despite there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, Theobald King of Navarre forraged the countrey of Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, to the just overthrow of him and his armie.</item>
                  <item>6. Reinold Vice-roy of Palestine, in the name of Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick the Emperour, and after him our Richard Earl of Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wall, drew up a firm peace with the said Sultan; which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly disturbed and interrupted by the turbulent Templars.</item>

Lastly, the Venetians, in the name of all Christian Princes, concluded a five yeares peace with Alphir the Mammaluke Prince of Egypt; yet some voluntaries in Ptolemais pillaged and robbed many Saracen merchants about the citie.

A sinne so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to all morall honestie, so injurious to the quiet &amp; peace of the world, so odious in it self, so scandalous to all men, To dissolve a league when confirmed by Oath (the strongest bond of conscience, the end of particular strife, the soulder of publick peace, the sole assurance of amitie betwixt divers nations, made here below, but inrolled in his high court whose glorious name doth signe it;) a sinne, I say, so hainous, that God cannot but most severely punish it.<note place="margin">

               <p>SO much concerning those <hi>laesa principia</hi> in this Holy warre, Superstition and Perjurie, which struck at the root of it. Come we now to consider many other hindrances, which abated the good successe thereof. Amongst these we will not be so hereticall as to denie the Popes Primacie; but account him the first cause of their ill successe. Such wounds as we find in his credit, we will neither widen nor close up; but even present them to the Reader as we found them. In foure respects he baned the Christians good speed in this warre:
<list>
                     <item>1. He caused most of their truce-breaking with the Turks, urging men thereunto. Thus Pope Celestine drove on the Christians against the Turks, whilest as yet the peace our Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard concluded with them was not expired; and so many other times also. For alas! this was nothing with his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse; who sitting in the temple of God, so farre advanceth himself above God, as to dispense with oathes made sacred by the most holy and high name of God; and professing himself the sole Umpire and Peace-maker of the world, doth cut asun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der those onely sinews which hold peace together.</item>
                     <item>2. In that twice the Kingdome of Jerusalem was offered to the Christians, and the Popes Legates would not suffer them to accept it: (No doubt, by instructions from their Master; this being to be presumed on, That those his absolute creatures altered not a tittle, but went according to the copie that was set them) Once <hi>anno</hi> 1219; when Pelagius the Legate refused the free offer of Melechsala: And the second time, some thirtie yeares after; when the same bountifull profer weas refused by Odo the Popes Legate: For when the same Melechsala again offered the free resignation of the whole Kingdome of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:21984:135"/>

                     <item>3. Frederick the second, Emperour, was possessed of it; when the Pope molested him, and stirred up the Templars against him, as so many needles to prick him when he was to sit down on the throne.</item>
                     <item>4. By diverting the Pilgrimes, and over-titling his own quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels to be Gods cause; nothing being more common with him, then to employ those armies which were levied for the Holy warre, in subduing the Albingenses and many others of his private enemies.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>By all these it plainly appeareth, That what fair shews soever his Holinesse made, calling Councels, appointing Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, providing preachers, proclaiming pardons, to advance this warre; yet in very deed, he neither intended nor desired that the Christians should make a finall conquest of Palestine, but be imployed in continuall conquering it. He would have this warre go on <hi>cum decente pausa</hi>; fair and softly: let the Christians now beat the Turks, and then the Turks beat the Christians; and so let them take their turns, whilest his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate profit went on. For (as we touched before) to this warre the Pope condemned all dangerous persons (especially the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours of Germanie) to be there imployed. As little children are often set to school, not so much to learn, as to keep them out of harms way at home: so this carefull Father sent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his children to the Holy warre, not for any good he knew they would either do or get there, but it would keep them from worse doing; which otherwise would have been paddling in this puddle, raking in that channel, stirring up que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions and controversies unsavourie in the nostrils of his Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and perchance falling into the fire of discord and dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion against their own Father. Indeed at last this warre ended it self in despite of the Pope: Who no doubt would have driven this web (weaving and unweaving it, Penelope-like) much longer if he could: yet he digested more patiently the ending thereof, because the net might be taken away when the fish was already caught, and the warre spared now the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Emperours strength thereby was sufficiently abated in Italie.</p>
               <p>Much also this warre increased the <hi>intrado</hi> of the Popes revenues. Some say, Purgatory-fire heateth his kitchin: they may adde, the Holy warre filled his pot, if not paid for all his second course. It is land enough, to have the office of collecting the contributions of all Christendome given to this
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:21984:135"/>
warre. So much for his great receits hereby. And as for what he expended, not too farre in the point. If the Pope (saith <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Dist.</hi> 40. <hi>can.</hi> Si Papa suae &amp; fraternae salutis negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gens.</note> their law) thrusteth thousands of souls into Hell, none may say to him, Why doest thou so? It is presumption then to make him answer for money, who is not accountable for men.</p>
               <p>With the Pope let the Emperours of Greece their Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie go, as the second bane of the Christians successe in this warre. These Emperours tormented themselves in seeking that they would have been loth to find, the treacherie of the Latines; and therefore to begin first, used them with all trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherie: Whereof, largely <note n="*" place="margin">

And surely, though a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious circumspection be commendable in Princes; yet in such over-fear, they were no lesse injurious to themselves then to the western Pilgrimes. Yea generally, suspiciousnesse is as great an enemy to wisdome, as too much credulitie; it doing oftentimes as hurtfull wrong to friends, as the other doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive wrongfull hurt from dissemblers.</p>

               <p>THe next cause of their ill successe was the discord arising from the paritie of the Princes which undertook this voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. Many of them could abide no equall; all, no superiour: so that they had no chief, or rather were all chiefs: The swarm wanted a master-Bee, a supreme commander, who should aw them all into obedience. The Germane Emperour (though above all) came but seldome, and was not constant amongst them: The King of Jerusalem (especially in the declining of the State) was rather sleighted then feared: The Popes Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate usurped a superioritie, but was never willingly nor ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally obeyed. Surely smaller forces being united under one command would have been more effectuall in proof (though not so promising in opinion and fame) then these great armies variously compounded by associations and leagues, and of the confluence of Princes otherwise unconcurring in their severall courses.</p>

<pb n="252" facs="tcp:21984:136"/>
the armies joyned, the shouting of the Romanes was farre more great and terrible, as being all of one voice from the same nation; whilest Hannibals souldiers voices were different and disagreeing, as consisting of severall languages. If such a toy be considerable, and differing in tongues lesseneth the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riblenesse in an armie; how doth dissenting in hearts and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections abate the force thereof? and what advantage had the united Turks against divided Christian Princes which managed this warre? Had the emulation betwixt those equall Princes onely been such as is the spurre of vertue, farre from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie and hatefull contention, striving with good deserts to outstrip those who by the same means sought to attain to the like end; had it been mixed with love in regard of the affini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their affections and sympathie of their desires, not seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ruine of their competitour but succouring him in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; then such <hi>simultates</hi> had been both honourable and use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to the advancing of the Holy cause: But on the other side, their affections were so violent, and dispositions so crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that emulation in them boyled to hatred, that to malice, which rested better satisfied with the miserable end of their opposite partner, then with any tropheys deservedly erected to their own honour. And herein the warres betwixt the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians and Genoans in Syria are too pregnant an instance.</p>
               <p>The length of the journey succeedeth as the fourth impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment. There needed no other hindrance to this voyage then the voyage; the way was so long. In sensation, the object must not be over-distant from the sense; otherwise Lynceus eyes may see nothing? So it is requisite in warlike adventures, that the work be not too farre from the undertakers. Indeed the Romanes conquered countreys farre from home: but the lands betwixt them were their own, wherein they refreshed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; and well may one lift a great weight at arms end if he hath a rest to stay his elbow on. So though Spain hath sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued much in the Indies, yet there they met with none or naked resistance. It fared not thus with the Christians in this warre: By the tediousnesse of the journey their strength was exhaust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; they ranne dregs when first they were broched in Syria, and as it were scattered their powder in presenting, before they came to discharge.</p>
               <p>Frederick Barbarossa wrote a braving letter to Saladine, reckoning up the severall nations in Europe under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and boasting what an armie of them he would bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Syria. <note n="*" place="margin">

you must passe before you can bring your men hither. Besides, if the Christians shaped their journey by land, then their miseries in Hungarie, Grecia, and Asia the lesse, made their land-journey more tedious and troublesome then if they had gone by sea.</p>

               <p>THat Prelates and Clergie-men were often Generalls in this action (as Peter the Hermite, Pelagius the Cardinall, and many others) was another cause of their ill successe: For allow them able in their own way, for matter of learning, yet were they unsufficient to manage martiall affairs. Many who in England have learned the French tongue, and afterwards have gone over into France, have found themselves both deaf and dumbe in effect, neither hearing to understand nor speaking to be understood: They in like manner who frame to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in their studies a model of leading an armie, find it as full of errours as rules when it e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>meth to be applied; and a measure of warre taken by book, falleth out either too long or too short, when brought into the field to be used.</p>
               <p>I have heard a storie of a great map-monger, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to travel over England by help of his maps, without ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the least direction of any he met. Long he had not ridden but he met with a <hi>non plus ultrà,</hi> a deep unpassable gullet of water, without bridge, ford, or ferry. This water was as unknown to his Camdens or Speeds maps as to himself; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was neither body nor branch of any constant river or brook (such as onely are visible in maps) but an <hi>ex-tempore</hi>-water, flowing from the snow which melted on hills. Worse unexpected accidents surprise those who conceive themselves to have conned all martiall maximes out of Authours, and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant their skill in warre against all events out of their great read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; when on the sudden some unwonted occurrent taketh them unprovided, standing amazed till destruction seiseth on them.</p>
               <p>Indeed, sometimes such unlooked-for chances arrest even the best and most experienced Generalls, which have long been acquainted with warre; nor are they priviledged by all their experience from such casualties, nor are they so omnisci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent but that their skill may be posed therewith, a minute shewing sometimes what an age hath not seen before: But
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:21984:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>
then such aged commanders have this advantage, that finding themselves at a fault, they can soonest know where to beat about and recover it.</p>
               <p>Adde to the inabilitie, the incongruitie of Prelates going to fight. True, in defensive warres necessitie is their sufficient dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pensation; but otherwise it is improper. In the battel against Amalek, Josua fought; Moses prayed; the Levites bare the ark, no office of command in the Camp. And better it had been that Cardinall Columna had been at his beads, or in his bed, or any where else, then in the camp in Egypt; where by his indiscreet counsel he brought all the lives of the Christians into danger.</p>

               <p>NOw followeth the Diversitie of the climate, which caused the death of many thousands of the Christians, sweeping them away with horrible plagues and other diseases. For even as men when they come into a new Corporation, must pay their fees before they can be freemen thereof and set up trading therein; so it alwayes cost the Christians of Europe a dangerous sicknesse at least, before they could be well acquainted with the aire and climate of Palestine.</p>
               <p>Amongst other diseases the Leprosie was one epidemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call infection which tainted the Pilgrimes coming thither. This (though most rife in our Saviours time, God so order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it that Judea was sickest while her Physician was nearest) at this time of the Holy warre was very dangerous. Hence was it brought over into England (never before known in this Island) and many Lazar-houses erected for the relief of those infected therewith: Their chief house was at Burton-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zars in Leicester-shire. I say not, as this disease began with the Holy warre in England, so it ended with it: Sure such hath been Gods goodnesse, that few at this day are afflicted therewith; and the leprosie of Leprosie, I mean the contagion thereof, in this cold countrey is much abated.</p>
               <p>Many other sicknesses seised on the Pilgrimes there, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in summer. The Turks, like Salamanders, could live in that
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:21984:137"/>
fiery countrey, whose scorching our Northern bodies could not endure. Yea, long before I find it observed by Vitruvius, that they who come cold into hot countreys, cannot long subsist, but are dissolved; whilest those that change out of hot into cold, find not onely no distemper and sicknesse by the alteration, but also grow more healthfull, solid, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted: But this perchance is easilyer said then maintained.</p>
               <p>But let us not hereupon be disheartened to set on our Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern foes for fear to be impaired, nor they invited to invade us by hope to be improved. Know, it is not so much the climate, as bad and unwholesome diet inraging the climate against us, which unsineweth those Northern nations when they come into the South: Which bad diet, though sometimes necessary for want of better food, yet is most-times voluntary through mens wilfull intemperance. In the Portugall action <hi>anno</hi> 1589, more English owed their Calenture to the heat of wine then wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Why do our English merchants bodies fadge well enough in Southern aire? why cannot our valour thrive as well there as our profit; but chiefly for this, That merchants are carefull of themselves, whilest souldiers count it basenesse to be thrif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of their own healths?</p>
               <p>Besides, the sinnes of the South unmasculate Northern bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. In hot countreys the Sirens of pleasure sing the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, which quickly ravish our eares unused to such musick. But should we marching Southwards observe our health in some proportion of temperance, and by degrees habituate our selves to the climate; and should we keep our souls from their sinnes, no doubt the North might pierce the South as farre, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in erect as high and long-lasting tropheys, as ever the South did in the North.</p>
               <p>Nor must it have admittance without examination into a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious breast, what some have observed; That Northern peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple never enjoyed any durable settled government in the South. Experience avoweth they are more happie in speedie conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in long enjoying of countreys.</p>
               <p>But the first Monarch the world ever knew (I mean, the Assyrian) came from the North: Whence he is so often styled in Scripture, The King of the North; conquering, and for many yeares enjoying those countreys which lie betwixt him and the sunne; as Chaldea, Mesopotamia, Babylonia, Syria, Egypt: To speak nothing of the Turks, who in the dichotomizing of the world fall under the Northern part, and coming out of Scythia at first subdued most Southern countreys.</p>

               <p>THus are we fallen on the next hindrance of successe in this Holy warre, the Vitiousnesse of the undertakers. But here first we must make an honourable reservation for many adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers herein, whom we confesse most pious and religious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Let us not raise the opinion of our own pietie by tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling on our predecessours, as if this age had monopolized all goodnesse to it self. Some no doubt most religious and truly valiant (as fearing nothing but sinne) engaged themselves in this action; of whom I could onely wish, that their zeal herein had either had more light or lesse heat. But with these, I say not how many, but too many went most wicked people, the causers of the ill successe.</p>
               <p>It will be objected, <hi>Sanctitas morum</hi> hath been made of some a note of the true Church, never the signe of a fortunate ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie: Look on all armies generally, we shall find them of the souldiers religion, not troubled with over-much precisenesse: As our King John said, (whether wittily or wickedly, let others judge) That the Buck he opened was fat, yet never heard Masse: so many souldiers have been successefull with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least smack of pietie; some such desperate villains, that fortune (to erroneous judgements) may seem to have favoured them for fear.</p>
               <p>True: but we must not consider these adventurers as plain and mere souldiers, but as Pilgrimes and Gods armie; in whom was required, and from whom was expected more pietie and puritie of life and manners then in ordinarie men: whereas on the contrarie, we shall make it appear, that they were more vitious then the common sort of men. Nor do we this out of crueltie or wantonnesse, to wound and mangle the memorie of the dead; but to anatomize and open their ulcerous insides, that the dead may teach the living, and lesson posteritie.</p>
               <p>Besides those that went, many were either driven or fled to the Holy land. Those were driven, who having committed some <note n="*" place="margin">Totum vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus, tam casti quàm incesti, adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teri, homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidae, perjuri, praedones, <hi>Albertus A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quensis, Chron.

Many a whore was sent thither to find her virginitie: Many a murderer was enjoyned to fight in the Holy warre, to wash off the guilt of Christian bloud by shedding bloud of Turks. The like was in all other offenses; malefactours were sent hither to satisfie for their former wickednesse. Now God forbid we should con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn

them, if truly penitents, for impious. May he who speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth against penitents, never have the honour to be one; since Repentance is the younger brother to Innocence it self.

Others fled hither, who having supererogated the gallows in their own countreys by their severall misdemeanours, theft, rapes, incest, murders, to avoid the stroke of Justice, protected them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves under this voyage; and coming to Palestine, so profited in those Eastern schools of vices, that they learned to be more artificially wicked. This plainly appeareth, as in sundrie other Authours, so chiefly in Tyrius, a witnesse beyond exception, who <note n="*" place="margin">

But wether or no this was sacriledge, we referre the reader to what hath been largely discussed before.</p>
               <p>And here I could wish to be an auditour at the learned and unpartiall arguing of this question, Whether over-great dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to the Church may not afterwards be revoked? On the one side it would be pleaded, who should be judge of the over-greatnesse, seeing too many are so narrow-hearted to the Church, they count any thing too large for it; yea, some would cut off the flesh of the Churches necessary maintenance, under pretense to cure her of a tympanie of superfluities. Besides, it would be alledged, What once hath been bestowed on pious uses, must ever remain thereto: To give a thing and take a thing, is a play too childish for children; much lesse must God be mocked therewith, in resuming what hath been conferred upon him. It would be argued on the other side, That when Kings do perceive the Church readie to devoure the Commonwealth by vast and unlimited donations unto it, and Clergie-men grown to suspicious greatnesse, armed with hurtfull and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous priviledges derogatorie to the royaltie of Princes; then, then it is high time for Princes to pare their overgrown great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. But this high pitch we leave to stronger wings: Sure I am in another kind, this Holy warre was guiltie of sacriledge, and for which it thrived no whit the better; in that the Pope exempted six and twentie thousand manours in Europe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Templars and Hospitallers, from paying any tithes to the Priest of the parish; so that many a minister in England smarteth at this day for the Holy warre. And if this be not sacriledge, to take away the dowrie of the Church without assuring her any joynture in lieu of it, I report my self to any that have not the pearl of prejudice in the eye of their judgement.</p>

               <head>Chap. 18. Three grand faults in the Kingdome of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, hindring the strength and puissance thereof.</head>
               <p>COme we now to survey the Kingdome of Jerusalem in it self: We will take it in its verticall point, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Baldwine the third, when grown to the best strength and beautie; yet even then had it some faults, whereby it was impossible ever long to subsist.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It lay farre from any true friend. On the West it was bounded with the mid-land-sea, but on all other sides it was environed with an Ocean of foes, and was a countrey conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually besieged with enemies. One being to sell his house, amongst other commendations thereof, proclaimed, That his house had a very good neighbour; a thing indeed conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable in the purchase, and might advance the fale thereof a yeares value: Sure I am, the Kingdome of Jerusalem had no such conveniencie, having bad neighbours round about: Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus indeed their friend lay within a dayes sail; but alas! the Kings thereof had their hands full to defend themselves, and could scarce spare a finger to help any other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Kingdome was farre extended, but not well com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted: all the bodie thereof ran out in arms and legs. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that ground inhabited formerly by the twelve tribes, and properly called the Holy land; the Kingdome of Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem ranged Northward over all Celosyria and Cilicia in the lesser Asia: North-eastward, it roved over the Principalities of Antioch and Edessa, even unto Carrae beyond Euphrates: Eastward, it possessed farre beyond Jordan the strong fort of Cracci, with a great part of Arabia Petrea: Southward, it stretched to the entrance of Egypt. But as he is a strong man, whose joynts are well set and knit together, not whom nature hath spunne out all in length and never thickened him; so it is the united and well compacted Kingdome entire in it self which is strong, not that which reacheth and strideth the farthest. For in the midst of the Kingdome of Jerusalem lay the Kingdome of Damascus, like a canker feeding on the breast thereof: and clean through the Holy land, though the Christians had many cities sprinkled here and there, the Turks in other strong holds continued mingled amongst them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Lastly, (what we have touched once before) some sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to the Kings of Jerusalem, namely, the Princes of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>och, Edessa and Tripoli, had too large and absolute power
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:21984:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and authoritie: They would do whatsoever the King would command them, if they thought good themselves. Now sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects should be Adjectives, not able to stand without (much lesse against) their Prince, or they will make but bad constru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction otherwise.</p>
               <p>These three hindrances in the Kingdome of Jerusalem added to the nine former, will complete a Jurie. Now if any one chance to censure one or two of them, let him not triumph therein; for we produce not these impediments severally but joyntly, not to fight single duells but all in an armie: <hi>Non no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceant quamvìs singula, juncta nocent.</hi>

               <head>Chap. 19. What is to be conceived of the incredible nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rousnesse of many armies mentioned in this storie.</head>
               <p>FRequent mention hath been made through this Holy warre of many armies, as well Christian as Turkish, whose number of souldiers swell very great; so as it will not be amisse once for all to discusse the point concerning the numerousnesse of armies anciently. And herein we branch our opinion into these severals.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. Asian armies are generally observed greater then those of Europe: There it is but a sucking and infant companie to have ten thousand; yea, under fiftie thousand no number. The reason of their multitude is, not that Asia is more populous, but more spatious then Europe. Christendome is enclosed into many small Kingdomes and free States; which severally can send forth no vast numbers, and seldome agree so well as to make a joynt collection of their forces: Asia lieth in common, in large countreys, and many of them united under one head. Besides, it is probable (especially in ancient times, as may be proved out of Scripture) that those Eastern coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys often spend their whole stock of men, and imploy all their arms-bearing people in their martiall service, not pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or culling them out, as we in Europe use to do.</item>
                  <item>2. Modern armies are farre lesse then those in former ages. The warre-<hi>genius</hi> of the world is altered now-a-dayes, and supplieth number with police; the foxes skinne pieceth out the lions hide. Especially armies have been printed in a smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler letter since guns came up: One well-mounted cannon will
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:21984:140" rendition="simple:additions"/>
spare the presence and play the part of a whole band in a battel.</item>
                  <item>3. Armies both of Europe, and chiefly in Asia (as farther off) are reported farre greater then truth. Even as many old men use to set the clock of their age too fast when once past seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie; and growing ten yeares in a twelve-moneth, are presently fourescore, yea, within a yeare or two after, climbe up to an hundred: So it is in relating the number of souldiers; if they exceed threescore and ten thousand, then <hi>ad rotunditatem nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meri,</hi> they are hoised up to an hundred, and then fiftie thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand more cast in for advantage. Not to speak of the facil mistake in figures; One telleth, at the first voyage of Pilgrimes there went forth <note n="*" place="margin">

                        <hi>Lamp. Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lific. hist. pag.</hi> 313.</note> another count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth three hundred thousand slain at the last taking of Ptole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mais: their glib pennes making no more reckoning of men then of pinnes. We perchance may do justly in imitating the unjust steward, setting down in the bill of our belief but fifty for every hundred.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Nor is it any Paradox, but what will abide the touch, That competent forces of able and well-appointed and well-disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined souldiers under an experienced Generall, are farre more usefull then such an unweldie multitude. Little loadstones will in proportion attract a greater quantitie of steel then those which be farre greater, because their poles are nearer toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and so their vertue more united: So shall we find braver atchievements by moderate armies, then by such portentous and extravagant numbers. I never read of any miracle done by the statue of S. Christopher in Paris, though he be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of a mountainlike then manlike bignesse. Yea, such im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate great armies are subject to great inconveniences. 1. They are not so easily manageable; and the commands of their Generall cool and lose some vertue in passing so long a journey through so many. 2. It is improbable that so many thousands can be heaped together, but the armie will be very heterogeneous, patched up of different people unsuiting in their manners; which must needs occasion much cumbrance. 3. These crowds of souldiers may hinder one another in their service; as many at the same time pressing out at a wicket. 4. Victuals for so many mouthes will not easily be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided; the provisions of a countrey serving them but a meal, they must fast afterwards. 5. Lastly, such great numbers (though this, I must confesse, is onely <hi>per accidens,</hi> yet often incident) beget carelessenesse and confidence in them; as if they would not thank God for their victories, but conceive it a due debt owed to their multitudes. This hath induced some to the opinion to maintain, That a competent able armie
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:21984:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of thirtie thousand (which number Gonzaga that brave Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall did pitch on as sufficient and complete) need not fear upon a paritie in all other respects, any companie whatsoever to come against them: such are enough, being as good as a feast, and farre better then a surfet.</p>

               <p>In the third voyage, Conrade the Emperour led forth no fewer then two hundred thousand foot and fiftie thousand horse; nor was the armie of King Lewis of France farre infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour: Of whom such as returned make no noise, as not consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in number.</p>
               <p>At the fourth setting forth, Frederick Barbarossa counted an hundred and fiftie thousand souldiers in his armie: Of whom when they came to Ptolemais, no more then <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>P. Aemyl. in Phil. Aug. pag.</hi> 175.</note> eighteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred armed men remained.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, what numbers were carried forth by our Richard the first and Philip of France, I find not specified; no doubt they did bear proportion to the greatnesse of the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers: All which at their return were consumed to a very small companie.</p>
               <p>To omit severall other intermediate actions of many Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, who went forth with armies and scarce came home with families; King Lewis carried forth two and thirty thousand: Of
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:21984:141" rendition="simple:additions"/>

               <p>But enough of this dolefull subject. If young Physicians with the first fee for their practice are to purchase a new church-yard, Pope Urbane the second might well have bought some ground for graves when he first perswaded this bloudie project; whereby he made all Jerusalem, Golgotha, a place for sculls; and all the Holy land, Aceldama, a field of bloud.</p>

               <head>Chap. 21. The throne of Deserts: What nation merited most praise in this warre; And first of the French and Dutch service therein.</head>
               <p>AS in the first book we welcomed each severall nation when they first entred into this service; so it is good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners now to take our solemn farewell of them at their going out, and to examine which of them deserved most commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for their valour in this warre. And herein me thinketh the distinction usuall in some Colledges, of Founders, By-founders, and Benefactours, may properly take place. The Founders of this Holy warre, were the French; the By-found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the Dutch, English, and Italian; the Benefactours (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different degrees of bountie) the Spanish, Polish, Danish, Scots, and all other people of Europe.</p>
               <p>The French I make the Founders for these reasons: First, because they began the action first. Secondly, France in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion sent most adventurers. Some voyages were all of French, and all voyages were of some French. Yea, French men were so frequent at Jerusalem, that at this day all Western Europeans there are called Franks (as I once conceived, and perchance not without companie in my errour) because so many French men came thither in the Holy warre. Since, I am converted from that false opinion, having found that two
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:21984:142" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hundred yeares before the Holy warre was dreamed of, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in the time of Constantine <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide M. Selden on Polyolbion, pag.</hi> 150.</note> Porphyrogenetes Emperour of the East, all Western Christians were known to the Greeks by the name of <hi>Franks</hi>; so that it seemeth the Turks borrowed that appellation from the Grecians. Thirdly, As France sent the most, so many of most eminent note: She sheweth for the game no worse cards then a pair royall of Kings; Lewis the Young, Philip Augustus, and Saint Lewis; besides Philip the Bold his sonne, who went half-way to Tunis. The first and last Christian King of Europe that went to Palestine was a French man; and all the Kings of Jerusalem, Frederick the Emperour onely excepted, originally were of that nation. Fourthly, Even at this day France is most loyall to the cause. Most grand Masters of the Hospitallers have been French men: And at this day the Knights of Malta, who have but foure Albergies or Seminaries in all Christendome, have <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Sandys Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, pag.</hi> 229</note> three of them in France; viz. one of the France in generall, one of Avergne, and one of Provence. Yet France carrieth not the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hand so clearly but that Germanie justleth for it; especially if we adde to it the Low-countreys, the best stable of woodden horses, and most potent in shipping in that age of any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey in Europe; which though an <hi>amphibion</hi> betwixt both, yet custome at this day adjudgeth it Dutch.</p>
               <p>Now these are the severall accents of honour in the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane service: First, That countrey sheweth three Emperours in the Holy warre; Conrade, Frederick Barbarossa, and Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derick the second. The last of these was solemnly crowned and peaceably possessed King of Jerusalem. Secondly, Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie sent more Princes to this warre then all Europe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides. It would be an infinite task to reckon them all; it being true of the Germane Nobilitie what Logicians say of a <hi>Line,</hi> that it is <hi>divisibilis in semper divisibilia.</hi> Here honours equally descend to sonnes and daughters; whereby they have Counts without counting in the whole Empire: There were seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Princes of Henault, and seven and twentie Earls of Mans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field all living together: So that one of their own countreymen saith, That the Dutch esteem none to be men but onely such as are Noble-men. We will not take notice of Germanie as it is minced into pettie Principalities, but as cut into principall Provinces. We find these regnant Princes (for as for their younger brethren, herein they are not accounted) to have been personally present in the Holy warre:

All these (I say not, these were all) went themselves, &amp; led forth other companies suitable to their greatnesse. The Reader, as he lighteth on more, at his leisure may strike them into this cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue. Thirdly, Germanie maintained the Teutonick Order, wholly consisting of her nation; besides Templars and Hospital<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, whereof she had abundance: of whose loyall and valiant ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice we have spoken largely before.

               <head>Chap. 22. The English and Italian service compared; Of the Spanish, Polish, Norvegian, Hungarian, Danish, and Swedish performance in this warre.</head>
               <p>NExt in this race of honour follow England and Italie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very even and hard-matched. England (it is no flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terie to affirm what envie cannot denie) spurreth up close for the prize; and though she had a great disadvantage in the starting (Italie being much nearer to Palestine) yet she quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recovered it. Our countrey sent one King (Richard the first) and three Kings sonnes (Robert Courthois, Richard of Cornwall, and Prince Edward) to this warre. Yea, England was a dayly friend to this action: and besides these great and grosse summes of visible adventurers, she dropped and cast in privily many a Pilgrime of good qualitie; so that there was scarce any remarkable battel or memorable siege done through the warre wherein there were not some English of eminent desert.</p>
               <p>Yet Italy cometh not any whit behind, if the atchievements of her severall States, Venetians, Genoans, Pisans, Sicilians, Florentines, were made and moulded up together: Yea, for sea-service and engineers in this warre, they bear the bell away from all other nations. But these things allay the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian service: 1. It was not so abstracted from the dregs of mercinarinesse as that of other countreys (whose adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers counted their very work herein sufficient wages) but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would yeeld their assistance they indented and cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted with the King of Jerusalem to have such and such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, pensions, and priviledges in all places they took, to them and their posteritie; not as an honorarie reward freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on them, but in nature of wages <hi>ex pacto</hi> contracted for aforehand: as the Genoans had in Ptolemais, and the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netians in Tyre. 2. These Italians stopped two gaps with one bush:<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tyrius, lib.</hi> 10. <hi>cap.</hi> 28. <hi>&amp; lib.</hi> 12. <hi>cap.</hi> 25.</note> they were Merchant-Pilgrimes, &amp; together applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to profit and pietie. Here in Tyre they had their banks, and did drive a sweet trade of spices and other Eastern com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities. 3. Lastly, As at first they gave good milk, so they kicked it down with their heel, and by their mutuall discord caused the losse of all they helped to gain in Syria.</p>
               <p>Spain was exercised all the time of this warre in defending her self against the Moores and Saracens in her own bowels: Yet such was her charitie, that whilest her own house was on
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:21984:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
burning, she threw some buckets of water to quench her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: and as other nations cast their superfluitie, she her wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows mite into the treasurie of this action; and produceth two Theobalds Kings of Navarre, and Alphonse King of Castile, that undertook expeditions to Palestine.</p>
               <p>Hungary sheweth one King, Andrew; who washed himself in Jordan, and then shrinking in the wetting returned present<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly home again. But this countrey, though it self did go little, yet was much gone through to the Holy warre (being the rode to Syria for all land-armies) and merited well in this acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in giving peaceable passage and courteous entertainment to Pilgrimes; as to Duke Godfrey, and Frederick Barbarossa, with all their souldiers as they travelled through it. Had the Kings of Hungarie had the same principle of basenesse in their souls as the Emperours of Grecia, they had had the same cause of jealousie against the Christians that passed this way; yet they used them most kindly, and disdained all dishonourable suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions. True it is, at the first voyage, King Coloman, not out of crueltie but carefulnesse and necessarie securitie, did use his sword against some unruly and disorderly Pilgrimes: but none were there abused which first abused not themselves. But what-ever Hungarie was in that age, it is at this day Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes best land-bulwark against the Turks: Where this pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie custome is used, That the men wear so many feathers as they have killed Turks; which if observed elsewhere, either feathers would be lesse, or valour more in fashion.</p>

But if by King Davids <note n="*" place="margin">1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 30.24.</note> statute, the keepers of the baggage are to be sharers in the spoil with the fighters of the battel, then surely Poland and such other countreys may entitle themselves to the honour of the warre in Palestine; which in the mean time kept home, had an eye to the main chance, and defended Europe against forrein invaders.</p>
               <p>Norway (in that age the sprucest of the three Kingdomes of Scandia, and best tricked up with shipping; though at this day the case is altered with her, and she turned from taking to paying of tribute) sent her fleet of tall souldiers to Syria: who like good fellows, asked nothing for their work but their victuals, and valiantly wonne the citie of Sidon for the King of Jerusalem. And it is considerable, that Syria (but a step or

               <head>Chap. 23. Of the Scottish, Welsh, and Irish, their severall adventures.</head>
               <p>THere remain behind the Scottish, Welsh, and Irish. It may occasion suspicion, that these nations either did neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect or are neglected in this Holy warre, because clean through this Historie there is no mention of them or their atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. True it is, these countreys can boast of no King of their own sent to Syria, nor of any great appearing service by them alone performed. It seemeth then they did not so much play the game themselves, as bet on the hands of others: and haply the Scottish service is accounted to the French; the Welsh and Irish, to the English.</p>
               <p>That Scotland was no ciphre in this warre, plainly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; 1. In that <note n="*" place="margin">

suit without entertaining a procuratour for them. Nor must we here forget a Saint, William a Scot, of Perth by birth, by trade a baker, in charitie so abundant that he gave his tenth loaf to the poore, in zeal so fervent that he vowed to visit the Holy land. But in his journey, as he passed through Kent,<note place="margin">

                  </note> he was slain by his servant, buried at Rochester; afterwards Sainted, and shewed many miracles.</p>
               <p>Neither may we think, whilest all other nations were at this Martiall school, that Wales the while truanted at home. The Welsh, saith my <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Ireland also putteth in for her portion of honour in this service. Indeed, for the first fourescore yeares in the Holy warre, Ireland did little there, or in any other countrey. It was divided into many pettie Kingdomes; so that her peoples va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour had no progressive motion in length, to make any impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion in forrein parts, but onely moved round in a circle at home, their pettie <hi>Reguli</hi> spending themselves against them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, till our Henry the second conquered them all. After which time the Irish began to look abroad into Palestine: wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse many houses for Templars, and the stately Priorie of Kilmainam nigh Dublin for Hospitallers; the last Lord Prior whereof at the dissolution, was Sir John Rawson. Yea, we may well think, that all the consort of Christendome in this warre could have made no musick if the Irish Harp had been wanting.</p>

               <head>Chap. 25. Some offers of Christian Princes for Palestine since the end of the Holy warre, by Henry the fourth of England, Charles the eighth of France, and Iames the fourth of Scotland.</head>
               <p>AS after that the bodie of the sunne is set, some shining still surviveth in the west: so after this Holy warre was expired, we find some straggling rayes and beams of valour offering that way; ever and anon the Christian Princes ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a bout with that designe. To collect the severall essayes of Princes glancing on that project, were a task of great pains and small profit; specially, some of them being umbrages and State-representations rather then realities, to ingratiate Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with their subjects, or with the oratorie of so pious a project to woo money out of peoples purses, or thereby to cloke and cover armies levied to other intents: Besides, most of these designes were abortive, or aborsive rather, like those untimely miscarriages not honoured with a soul or the shape and lineaments of an infant. Yet to save the Readers longing, we will give him a tast or two; and begin with that of our Henry the fourth of England.</p>
               <p>The end of the reigne of this our Henry was peaceable and prosperous. For though his title was builded on a bad foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, yet it had strong buttresses: most of the Nobilitie fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured and fensed it: And as for the house of York, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared not; its best bloud as yet ranne in feminine veins, and therefore was the lesse active. Now King Henry in the sunne-shine evening of his life (after a stormie day) was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to walk abroad, and take in some forrein aire. He pitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his thoughts on the Holy <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Lord Veru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam, in his Henry</hi> vii. <hi>pag.</hi> 87.</note> warre, for to go to Jerusalem, and began to provide for the same. One principall motive which incited him was, That it was told him he should not die till he had heard Masse in Jerusalem. But this proved not like the revelation told to old <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 2.26.</note> Simeon: for King Henry was fain to sing his <hi>Nunc dimittis,</hi> before he expected; and died in the chamber called <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in Westminster. By com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring this prophesie with one of Apollo's oracles, we may conclude them to be brethren (they are so alike) and both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten of the father of lies: For the Devil eartheth himself in an homonymie, as a fox in the ground; if he be stopped at one hole, he will get out at another. How-ever, the Kings purpose
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:21984:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
deserveth remembrance and commendation, because really and seriously intended;</p>
               <p>Farre better, I beleeve, then that of Charles the eighth King of France: Who in a braving Embassage which he sent to our Henry the seventh, gave him to understand his resolutions; to make re-conquest of Naples, but as of a bridge to <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>L.

But our King Henry the seventh (being too good a fenser to mistake a flourish for a blow) quickly resented his drift (which was to perswade our King to peace, till Charles should perform his projects in little Britain and elsewhere) and dealt with him accordingly. And as for the gradation of King Charles his purposes, Naples, Grecia, Jerusalem, a stately but difficult ascent, (where the stairs are so farre asunder, the legs must be long to stride them) the French nation was weary of climbing the first, and then came down, vaulting nimbly into Naples and out of it again.</p>
               <p>More cordiall was that of <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Buchanan, in the life of Iames</hi> iiii.</note> James the fourth King of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, that pious Prince: who being touched in conscience for his fathers death (though he did not cause it, but seemed to countenance it with his presence) ever after, in token of his contrition, wore an iron chain about his body; and to expiate his fault, intended a journey into Syria. He prepared his navie, provided his soudiers, imparted his project to forrein Princes; and verily had gone, if at the first other warres, and afterwards sudden death had not caused his stay.</p>

               <head>Chap. 26. The fictitious voyage of William Landt-grave of Hesse to Palestine confuted.</head>
               <p>THese are enough to satisfie; more would cloy. Onely here I must discover a cheat, and have it pilloried, lest it trouble others as it hath done me: The storie I find in Calvisius, <hi>anno</hi> 1460: take it in his very words;
<q>William the Landt-grave ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed an Holy voyage to Palestine; chose his company out of many Noblemen and Earls, in number ninetie eight: He happily finished his journey; onely one of them died in Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus. He brought back with him six and fourtie ensignes of
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:21984:147"/>
horse.</q>
Seven moneths were spent in the voyage, <hi>Fab.</hi> So farre Calvisius, avouching this Fab. for his authour. Each word a wonder; not to say, an impossibilitie. What? in the yeare 1460, when the deluge of Mahometans had overrun most of Grecia, Asia, and Syria? William, a Landt-grave (of Hesse, no doubt) neither the greatest nor next to the greatest Prince in Germanie, farre from the sea, unfurnished with shipping, not within the suspicion of so great a performance! Six and fourtie horse-ensignes taken! Where? or from whom? Was it in warre, and but one man killed? A battel so bloudlesse seemeth as truth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse; and the losing but of one man savoureth of never a one. But seven moneths spent! Such atchievements beseem ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an apprentiship of yeares then moneths. Besides, was Fame all the while dead, speechlesse, or asleep, that she trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peted not this action abroad? Did onely this Fab. take notice of it? be he Faber, Fabius, Fabianus, Fabinianus, or what you please. Why is it not storied in other writers? the Dutch men giving no scant measure in such wares, and their Chronicles being more guiltie of remembring trifles then forgetting mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of moment?</p>
               <p>Yet the gravitie of Calvisius recording it, moveth me much on the other side; a Chronologer of such credit, that he may take up more belief on his bare word then some other on their bond. In this perplexitie, I wrote to my oracle in doubts of this nature, M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Joseph Mead fellow of Christs Colledge in Cambridge, since lately deceased: Heare his answer;

Good guard is kept about the citie, and no Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians with weapons suffered to enter. But the deepest ditch to defend Jerusalem from the Western Christians, is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motenesse of it; and the strongest wall to fense it, is the Turkish Empire compassing it round about.</p>
               <p>Poore it must needs be, having no considerable commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to vent; except a few beads of Holy earth, which they pay too deare for that have them for the fetching. There is in the citie a covent of Franciscans, to whom Christians repair for protection during their remaining in the citie. The Padre Guardian appointeth these Pilgrimes a Friar, who sheweth them all the monuments about the citie: Scarce a great stone, which beareth the brow of reverend antiquitie, that passeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a peculiar legend upon it: But every vault under ground hath in it a deep mysterie indeed. Pilgrimes must follow the Friar with their bodies and belief; and take heed how they give tradition the lie, though she tell one never so boldly. The survey finished, they must pay the Guardian both for their victuals and their welcome, and gratifie his good words and looks; otherwise if they forget it, he will be so bold as to remember them. The Guardian farmeth the Sepulchre of the Turk at a yearly rent: and the Turks which reap no benefit by Christs death, receive much profit by his buriall; and not content with their yearly rent, squeeze the Friars here on all occasions, making them pay large summes for little offenses.</p>
               <p>The other subsistence which the Friars here have, is from the benevolence of the Pope and other bountifull benefactours in Europe.

               <p>THus we state the question; Whether this Holy warre, I mean, for the winning of the citie of Jerusalem and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering of Palestine, will probably ever hereafter be project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and acted again. We may beleeve this tragedie came off so ill the last acting, that it will not be brought on the stage the second time.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Pope will never offer to give motion to it, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it unlikely to succeed. Policies of this nature are like sleights of hand, to be shewed but once; lest what is admired at first be derided afterwards.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Princes are grown more cunning, and will not bite at a bait so stale, so often breathed on. The Popes ends in this warre are now plainly smelt out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which though prettie and pleasing at first, yet Princes are not now, like the native Indians, to be cozened with glasse and gaudie toyes: The load-stone to draw their affection (now out of non-age) must present it self necessary, profitable, and probable to be effected.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There is a more needfull work nearer hand; to resist the Turks invasion in Europe. Heark how the Grecians call unto us, as once <note n="*" place="margin">

Lastly, who is not sensible with sorrow of the dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions (better suiting with my prayers then my penne) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with Christian Princes at this day are rent in sunder? wounds so wide that onely Heavens chirurgerie can heal them: Till which time no hope of a Holy warre against the generall and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon foe of our Religion.</p>

                  <pb n="278" facs="tcp:21984:149" rendition="simple:additions"/>We may safely conclude, that the regaining of Jerusalem and the Holy land from the Turks, may better be placed amongst our desires then our hopes; as improbable ever to come to passe: except the Platonick yeare, turning the wheel of all actions round about, bring the spoke of this Holy warre back again.</p>

yeare 1466. And now how would a Herald sweat with scouring over these time-rustie titles, to shew whence these Princes deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their severall claims, and in whom the right resteth at this day? &amp; when his work is done, who should pay him his wages?</p>
               <p>My clew of thread is not strong enough, on the guidance thereof for me to venture into this labyrinth of Pedegrees; we will content our selves with these generall observations:
<list>
                     <item>1. It seemeth this catalogue containeth as well those who had <hi>jus in Regno</hi> as those who had <hi>jus ad Regnum:</hi> as name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Prince of Thorone, and Patriarchs of Jerusalem, and State of Genoa; whose ambition surely soared not so high as to claim the Kingdome of Jerusalem, but rather perched it self upon some lands and Signories challenged therein.</item>
                     <item>2. A small matter will serve to intitle a Prince to a titular Kingdome: In this case, Kings can better digest corrivals where they be many, and all challenge what is worth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. In this catalogue it seemeth some onely intitle them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of good fellowship and love of good companie: These like squirrels recover themselves, and climbe up to a claim on the least bough, twig, yea leaf of a Right. Thus the Counts of Brienne in France (if any still remain of that house) gave away their cake and kept it still; in that John Bren parted with his right to this Kingdome, in match with Iole his daughter, to Frederick the second Emperour, and yet the Earls of his familie pretend still to Jerusalem.</item>
                     <item>3. We may beleeve, that by matches and under-matches some of these titles may reside in private Gentlemen; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in France: And what wonder? seeing within fourteen ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, the <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <item>4. At this day some of those titles are finally extinct: as that of the Emperours of the East, conquered by the Ottoman familie: Their Imperiall Eagle was so farre from beholding the sunne, that the half-moon dazzled, yea quite put out his eyes. Rank in the same form the Kings of Armenia, and Sultans of Egypt.</item>
                     <item>5. Some of these titles are translated: That of the Lusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnans, Kings of Cyprus, probably passed with that Island to the State of Venice; The claim of the Hungarian Kings seem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth at this day to remain in the Germane Emperour.</item>
                     <item>6. Some united: The claim of the Arch-dukes of Nize (a style I meet not with elsewhere) twisted with that of the Duke of Savoy; The Kings of Naples and Aragon now joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the King of Spain.</item>

               <head>Chap. 30. Of the greatnesse, strength, wealth, and wants of the Turkish Empire; What hopes of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proching ruine thereof.</head>
               <p>THe Turkish Empire is the greatest and best-compacted (not excepting the Romane it self in the height there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of) that the sunne ever saw. Take sea and land together (as bones and flesh make up one bodie) and from Buda in the West to Tauris in the East, it stretcheth about three thousand miles: little lesse is the extent thereof North and South. It lieth in the heart of the world, like a bold champion bidding defiance to all his borderers, commanding the most fruitfull countreys of Europe, Asia, and Africa: Onely America (not more happie in her rich mines then in her remotenesse) lieth free from the reach thereof.</p>
               <p>Populous it is not; for men will never grow thick where meat groweth thinne: It lieth waste, according to the old pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, Grasse springeth not where the Grand Signors horse setteth his foot. Besides, a third part (I may say, half) of those in Turkie are not Turks, but either Jews or Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</p>
               <p>The strength of this Empire consisteth either in bones or stones, men or munition. Of the first, The best stake in the Turks hedge is his great number of Horsemen called <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Knolls, in his descript. of the greatnesse of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Empire.</hi>
                  </note> Tima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots, conceived to exceed seven hundred thousand fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men: These are dispersed over all his Dominions, and have lands allotted unto them in reward of their good service and valour, much in the nature of those souldiers of the Romish Empire called <hi>Beneficiarii.</hi> And indeed the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kish Empire resembleth the Romane in many particulars: not that they ever studied imitation, and by reading of Historie conformed their State to Romane precedents, (farre be it from us to wrong them with the false imputation of so much learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) but rather casually they have met in some common principles of policie. Of these Timariots, on occasion and competent warning, he can bring into the field an hundred and fiftie thousand, all bound by the tenure of their lands to arm, clothe, feed, pay themselves: So great an armie,
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:21984:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which would drain the wealth of other Princes, doth cost the great Turk no drop of expense.</p>
               <p>Next follow his best footmen, called Janizaries, taken young from their Christian parents (parallel to the Romane Pretorian souldiers) being the guard of the Grand Signors person. But as they watch about him, so he casteth a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full eye on them; seeing of late they are grown from pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to be proud, yea insolent and intolerable: it being true of these Janizaries in the Turkish Empire, as of Elephants in an armie; If well ruled, they alone are enough to winne the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel; if unruly, they alone are enough to lose it. As for all other sorts of the Turks, both foot and horse, they are but slugs; as whom the Grand Signor little trusteth, and others need lesse fear.</p>
               <p>His frontier cities, especially those which respect Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, are exactly fortified. Rank with these such places of importance and castles as command passages of conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. As for his inland-cities, there is no superfluous, scarce competent, strength in them. But if we allow those people to be chaste who never were solicited to be otherwise, then may many cities lying in the bowels of his Empire passe for strong, which for a long time have not had nor in haste are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have the temptation of a siege.</p>
               <p>Of Ordinance he hath great store, and hath excellent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials to make them of; and is also very powerfull in shipping. Indeed ships of great burden would be burdensome in those narrow seas, and experience hath found lesser vessels of greater use; whereof he hath store. And though the Turks either want ingenie or industrie, either care not or cannot be good ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrights themselves; yet the spite is, as long as there is gold amongst the Turks there will be drosse amongst the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, I mean some who for base gain will betray the mysteries of our usefull arts unto them. As for wood to build with, he hath excellent in Bithynia; yea, generally in this wild Empire, trees grow better then men. To his sea-munition may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced his multitude of slaves, though not the informing yet (against their wills) the assisting form of his Galleys, and in whom consisteth a great part of their strength and swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</p>
               <p>Nor must we forget the Pirates of Tunis and Algier; which are Turks and no Turks: Sometimes the Grand Signor dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimeth, renounceth and casteth them off to stand upon their own bottom; as when those Christian Princes which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federate with him, complain to him of the wrongs those sea-robbers have done them. But though he sendeth them out to seek their own meat, he can clock them under his wings
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:21984:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
at pleasure: And we may verily beleeve, though sometimes in the summer of his own prosperitie he throweth them off as an upper garment of no use, yet in cold weather he will buckle them on again; and if necessitie pincheth him, receive them not as retainers at large but as his best servants in ordinarie.</p>
               <p>Nor is it the last and least part of the strength of this Empire, that all her native people are linked together in one religion: The discords about which in other kingdomes have been the cause, first of the unjoynting, and then of the finall ruine &amp; desolation of many worthy States: Whereas here, the Mahometane religion (if I wrong it not with so good a name) is so full of unitie and agreement, that there is no difference &amp; dissension about it. Yea, well may that coat have no seam which hath no shape. A sense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse ignorant profession it is, not able to go to the cost of a controversie: And all colours may well agree in the dark.</p>
               <p>Next the strength followeth the wealth; yea, it is part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: For all rich Kingdomes may be strong, and purchase arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall fortification. The certain and constant revenues of the great Turk are not great, if withall we consider the spatious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his Dominions. Some have mounted his ordinarie yearly in-come to eight <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Knolls.</hi>
                  </note> millions of gold. But men guesse by uncertain aim at Princes revenues, especially if they be so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote: We may beleeve that in their conjecture herein, though they misse the mark, they hit the butt. Farre greater might his <hi>intrado</hi> be, if husbandrie, and chiefly merchandise, were plied in his countrey: merchants being the <hi>Vena porta</hi> of a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; without which it may have good limbes, but emptie veins, and nourish little. Now although this Empire be of a vast extent, having many safe harbours to receive strangers there, and Staple commodities (chiefly if industrie were used) to allure them thither; yet hath it in effect but foure prime places of trading; Constantinople, Cairo, Aleppo, and Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. As for the extraordinarie revenues of the Grand Signor, by his escheats and other courses if he pleaseth to take them, they are a <hi>Nemo scit:</hi> For in effect he is worth as much as all his subjects (or slaves rather) throughout his whole Empire are worth, his spunges to squeeze at pleasure.</p>
               <p>But the Lion is not so fierce as he is painted, nor this Empire so formidable as fame giveth it out. The Turks head is lesse then his turbant, and his turbant lesse then it seemeth; swel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling without, hollow within. If more seriously it be consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, this State cannot be strong, which is a pure and abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute tyrannie. His subjects under him have nothing certain but this, That they have nothing certain; and may thank the Grand Signor for giving them whatsoever he taketh not away from them. Their goods they hold by permission not proprietie;
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:21984:152" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not sure that either they or theirs shall reap what they sow, or eat what they reap: and hereupon husbandrie is wholly neglected: For the plowman (as well as the ground he ploweth) will be soon out of heart, if not maintained and (as I may say) composted with hopes to receive benefit by his labours. Here great officers, if they love themselves, must labour not to be beloved: for popularitie is high treason; and generally wealth is a sinne to be expiated by death. In a word, it is a cruel ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, bathed in the bloud of their Emperours upon every succession; a heap of vassals and slaves; no Nobles (except for time being, by office) no Gentlemen, no Free-men, no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance of land, no Stirp or ancient families; a nation with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any, moralitie, arts and sciences, that can scarce measure an acre of land or houre of a day.</p>
               <p>And needeth not that Kingdome constant and continued pointing, which is cemented with fear not love? May we not justly think, that there be many in this Empire which rather wait a time then want desire to overthrow it? For though some think the Grecians in Turkie bear such inveterate hate to the Latine Christians, that they would rather refuse deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance then accept them for their deliverers; yet surely both they, and perchance some native Turks, out of that principle of desiring libertie (the second rule next preserving life in the charter of Nature) would be made (if this Empire were seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously invaded, so that the foundation thereof did totter) sooner to find two hands to pluck it down then one finger to hold it up.</p>
               <p>And we have just cause to hope that the fall of this unwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die Empire doth approch. It was high noon with it fiftie yeares ago; we hope now it draweth neare night: the rather, because luxurie, though late, yet at last hath found the Turks out, or they it. When first they came out of Turcomania, and were in their pure naturals, they were wonderfully abste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mious, neglecting all voluptuousnesse, not so much out of a dislike as ignorance of it: But now having tasted the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the cup, they can drink as great a draught as any others. That Paradise of corporall pleasure which Mahomet promised them in the world to come, they begin to anticipate here, at leastwise to take an earnest of it, and have well soked them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in luxurie. Yea, now they begin to grow covetous, both Prince and people, rather seeking to enjoy their means with quiet then enlarge them with danger.</p>
               <p>Heaven can as easily blast an oak as trample a mushrome. And we may expect the ruine of this great Empire will come: for of late it hath little increased its stock, and now begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth to spend of the principall. It were arrant presumption
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:21984:153"/>
for Flesh to prescribe God his way; or to teach him, when he meaneth to shoot, which arrow in his quiver to choose. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance the Western Christians, or the Grecians under him (though these be better for seconds then firsts, fitter to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then raise a faction) or his own Janizaries, or the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sian, or the Tartarian, or some other obscure Prince not as yet come into play in the World, shall have the lustre from God to maul this great Empire. It is more then enough for any man to set down the fate of a single soul; much more to resolve the doom of a whole nation when it shall be. These things we leave to Providence to work, and posteritie to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. As for our generation, let us sooner expect the dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our own Microcosmes then the confusion of this Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: For neither are own sinnes yet truly repented of, to have this punishment removed from us; nor the Turks wickednesse yet come to the full ripenesse, to have this great judgement laid upon them.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>Erein I present the Reader with a generall view and <hi>synopsis</hi> of the whole story of the age of the <hi>Holy Warre;</hi> that he may see the coherence betwixt the East and the West, and in what equipage and corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency of time the Asian affairs go on with those of Europe: for they will reflect a mutuall lustre and plainnesse on one another.</p>
            <p>The Chronologie is marshalled into Ranks &amp; Files: The Ranks, or transverse spaces, contain twentie yeares on a side; the Files, or co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes directly downward, are appropriated to those severall States whose name they bear.</p>
            <p>In the six first columnes I have followed <hi>Helvicus</hi> with an impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite faith, without any remarkable alteration, both in ingraffing of yeares and making them concurre, as also leaving sometimes emptie spaces. In the other columnes I have followed severall authours, and left the yeares unnoted where the time was uncertain; counting it better to bring in an <hi>Ignoramus</hi> then to find a verdict where the evidence was doubtfull and obscure.</p>
            <p>Such long notes as would not be imprisoned within the grates of this Chronology, we have referred by asterisks to the foot of the page.</p>
            <p>Know that every note belongeth to that yeare wherein it begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, except signed with this mark ☉; which reduceth it to the yeare it endeth in.</p>

            <p>Note, whilest there were Caliphs of Egypt, then the Sultans were but Deputies and Lieutenants; but afterwards the Mama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luke Sultans were absolute Princes, acknowledging no Superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
