            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT will not be denied but that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was once
a most pure, excellent, flourishing and Mother<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 1. 8.</note> Church.</p>
            <p>This Church could not cease to be such,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 16.</note> but she must fall
either by Apostasie,<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> Heresie or Schism.</p>
            <p>

but the very Name and Title to Christianity: No Man will
say, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had ever such a fall, or fell thus.</p>

<hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. By what General Council was she ever condemned?<note n="*" place="margin">2 Demonst.</note>
            </p>

            <p>3. By what Authority was she otherwise reproved? For,

                  <hi>Reynolds</hi> in his 5th. Conclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> that so great a
Church should be condemned by every one that hath a mind
to condemn her.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>III.</hi> Schism is a departure or division from the Unity of the
Church, whereby the Band and Communion held with some
former Church, is broken and dissolved.</p>
            <p>If ever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> divided her self by Schism from
any other Body of faithful Christians, or brake Communion,
or went forth from the Society of any Elder Church: <hi>I</hi> pray
satisfie me as to these particulars.</p>
            <p>1. Whose Company did she leave?</p>
            <p>2. From what Body did she go forth?</p>
            <p>3. Where was the true Church which she forsook?</p>
            <p>For it appears a little strange to me, that a Church should be
accounted Schismatical, when there cannot be assigned any
other Church different from her, (which from Age to Age,
since Christ his time, hath continued visible,) from whence she
departed.</p>

            <head>To my honoured Friend, Mr. S. B.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Had no sooner perused the Paper which I received
from you, but I perceived that it was penn'd
for the sake of such, as either are not well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the matters of Controversie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
Us and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> or with the Way
and Method of arguing. To such as these they are
wont to pretend high: To those that are ignorant of the
former, they talk of Antiquity and Universality; and to
such as are unskilful in the latter, of Demonstrations,
and self-evident Principles, of Axioms and Definitions.
But all this is a mere flourish of Words; for if these things
come strictly to be examined, instead of Antiquity, we
shall too frequently find Forgery and Imposture; instead
of the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> instead
of Demonstrations and Definitions, Sophistry and Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Arguments. And after this strain is this Paper
wrote, in which things are so artificially mingled, that
they look very speciously to those that do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand
them; and are so well fitted to work upon the
easie, the ignorant, and inconsiderate, that after it had
been printed, as I perceive, long since in <hi>Fiat Lux,</hi> it
is again singled out, to be put into the Hands of such as
they have a design upon. But I shall endeavour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel
it, and hope, by that time that I have done, that
what is therein said will appear to be wholly insufficient
to justifie their Church, and acquit it of those Crimes
it is charged with: And this I shall doe by shewing,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:41168:3"/>
First, That the whole is false.</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the particulars are very fallacious.</p>
            <p>The former I shall make good by these following
Considerations:</p>
            <p>I. That a Church may fall from what it once was.</p>
            <p>II. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not now what it was
in Apostolical and Primitive times; when it might most
of all pretend to be (as he calls it) <hi>a most pure, excellent,
and flourishing Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. That the alteration from what it was then, to
what it is now, is to the worse; and that it is thereby
intolerably corrupted.</p>
            <p>If these Propositions be proved, then the way taken
by our Authour will signifie nothing; since it will not
be worth the while to enquire how it is, whether it be
fallen by Apostasie, Heresie, or Schism, when it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable
that so it is, that it is fallen.</p>
            <p>I. That a Church may fall from what it once was;
that is, from its primitive Purity and Simplicity in Faith
and Manners, is evident to any that will read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and mind what is therein said of the Churches of
the <hi>Jews, Sardis</hi> and <hi>Laodicea;</hi> or that are acquainted
with Ecclesiastical History. And this they of the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> are bound to grant; who must acknowledge,
according to their own Principles, that we once were a
Church, when in their Communion; and that call us
Apostatical, Heretical, and what not, since we have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saken
it.</p>
            <p>II. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is not now what it was
in Apostolical and Primitive times, but is changed in
Principles and Practice.</p>
            <p>First, In Principles, as,</p>
            <p>1. That the Pope is Christ's Vicar; that is, that he is
the Universal Pastor over Christ's Flock, and hath a Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction
over all Churches whatsoever, is a new Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:41168:3"/>
This the Scripture (which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of
old used to appeal to) is so far from giving any Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
to, that our Saviour expresly cautions the Apostles
against any such Usurpation. Luke 22. 25. <hi>When
there was a strife among them, which of them should be
accounted the greatest; he said unto them, The Kings of
the</hi> Gentiles <hi>exercise Lordship over them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>but it
shall not be so: but he that is the greatest [or will be great,</hi>
Mark 10. 43.] <hi>among you, let him be as the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,</hi>
&amp;c and in the 30. <hi>v.</hi> saith, <hi>ye shall sit upon twelve
Thrones,</hi> &amp;c. not preferring one before the other. And
lest what he had occasionally spoke to <hi>Peter,</hi> Mat. 16. 19.
<hi>Whatsoever thou shalt bind on Earth, shall be bound in
Heaven,</hi> &amp;c. should be misconstrued, he doth give the
same power to the rest of the Apostles, both before his
Death, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 18. and also after his Resurrection, <hi>Joh.</hi>
20. 23. And if we would understand the sense of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,
as to this matter, I know no surer nor shorter
way, than to see what is said by the Councils; for then
the Fathers may be supposed to speak most impartially
and with greatest authority; and of this I shall give you
a brief Account. The first general Council was that of
<hi>Nice,</hi> called by <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, and held <hi>An.</hi> 325.
which in the sixth Canon doth thus decree, <hi>That the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop
of</hi> Alexandria, <hi>and accordingly of</hi> Antioch, <hi>and of
other Provinces, should have power over their own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
according to ancient Custome, and the Custome in that
case of the Church of</hi> Rome; <hi>and that none should invade
the Privileges of each other.</hi> The same is said and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed
in the second Canon of the second general Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
held at <hi>Constantinople</hi> by the command of <hi>Theodosius</hi>
the Emperour, <hi>An.</hi> 380. And farther ratified by the third
general Council at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> in the Year 431. <hi>Can.</hi> 8.</p>
            <p>If we go forward, we shall find that it was farther de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
in the abovesaid Council of <hi>Constantinople, Can. 3.
That the Bishop of</hi> Constantinople <hi>should have the order
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:41168:4"/>
of Primacy next to the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>because it is New</hi>
Rome. And what is thereby to be understood, is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
declared in the 28th. Canon of the Fourth Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Council assembled at <hi>Chalcedon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> An.</hi> 451. in which
it is decreed, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Constantinople <hi>should
have equal Privileges with that of</hi> Rome, <hi>there being the
same Reason for that as the other, as it was the Imperial
Seat:</hi> and accordingly is there a particular Instance gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in case of Appeals, <hi>Can.</hi> 9. From this Jurisdiction
which every Church had over its own Members, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
other Canons: as, <hi>That those who were excluded
the Communion of one Church, should not be received by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi>
so <hi>Can.</hi> 5. of the aforesaid Council of <hi>Nice. That
no Appeals should be made to foreign or transmarine
Churches;</hi> so the Council held at <hi>Milevis</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> (where
S. <hi>Augustine</hi> was present,) <hi>An. 416. Can.</hi> 22. which Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
<note n="‖" place="margin">L. 2. de Rom. Pon. cap. 24.</note> 
               <hi>Bellarmine</hi> confesseth was made with a particular
respect to <hi>Rome.</hi> To the same purpose the sixth Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil
held at <hi>Carthage, An.</hi> 420. (in which also S. <hi>Augustine</hi>
was) passed a Decree<note n="*" place="margin">Can. 31.</note>. From all which you may observe,
1. That the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> had anciently a limited Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction,
it was over his own Province onely. 2. That
the Jurisdiction which he had over his own Province
was such as all other Supreme Bishops had over theirs.
3. That none had a power to transgress the ancient and
settled bounds of Jurisdiction, or to invade those of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.
4. That the Honour given to the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>
(whatever priority it was that he had) was not by any
Divine Authority, but as <hi>Rome</hi> was the Imperial Seat.
5. That the Honour and Privilege which it had by that
means, was what another was capable of; for the same
was given to <hi>Constantinople.</hi> 6. That none of these De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
in those General Councils were ever opposed by the
Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> 'till the Council of <hi>Chalcedon.</hi> 7. That
at that time the pretences of the Pope's Legates were
universally opposed and rejected. And I may add,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:41168:4"/>
8. That what was at any time in those days claimed by
the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> was claimed not upon any Divine
Authority, but onely upon the Authority of the Council
of <hi>Nice,</hi> (as it appears from the transactions in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
Council of <hi>Carthage.</hi>) 9. What was then claimed
under that pretext, was upon a pretended, if not a forged,
Canon of the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> which was detected so to
be by that Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and their Usurpation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected,
as is evident from the Acts of that Council, and
the Epistle written by the Fathers there assembled, to
Pope <hi>Celestine</hi> upon it.</p>
            <p>From all which it appears (and more I could shew)
that there was no such thing originally, as this Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
Pastorship, which the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> doth now
challenge, and that <hi>Rome</hi> is therein changed from what
it was.</p>
            <p>And now let our Authour ask (if he please) <hi>by what
Councils was the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>ever condemned?</hi> And
you may answer, by the four first general Councils. Let
him ask again, <hi>Which of the Fathers ever wrote against
her?</hi> And you may answer, no less than 1068. for so
many were then convened in all these four Councils.
And if this suffice not, we may turn him to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils
of <hi>Milevis</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> before-mentioned, and to
others also of good Authority, besides particular Fathers.
I have been the longer upon this, not onely because it
could not be well comprised in less, but also because if
this Claim of theirs fall, their Cause must fall with it.</p>
            <p>2. Another new Principle of theirs is, That the Pope
hath at least, <hi>in ordine ad Spiritualia,</hi> a Power over all
Kingdoms within the Church, and of deposing Kings in
case of Heresie, or Obstinacy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and of absolving Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
from their Allegiance to them when thus deposed.
That this is the Principle of their Church is plain from
<hi>Can.</hi> 3. of the Fourth Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> and from the
Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in <hi>Sess. 25. de reform. c.</hi> 19. where it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:41168:5"/>
is somewhat covertly expressed, for a Reason which the
state of Affairs at that time made necessary. That this is
the Doctrine of their Church, is proved beyond all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction,
by the present Lord Bishop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> in his
late Learned Treatise <hi>Of Popery,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But that this Doctrine of theirs is <hi>new,</hi> is commonly
confessed among themselves, and maintained so to be by
several of their own Communion, and which any one
may so far receive satisfaction in, from what is written
by <hi>Roger Widdrington (aliàs Preston</hi>) in his <hi>Apologia pro
Jure Principum,</hi> and his <hi>Humillima Supplicatio ad Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum
Quintum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. <hi>Transubstantiation was not originally an Article of
their Creed, as it is now. So it is said by</hi> Jo. Tribarn,
<note n="*" place="margin">Comment. in 4. Sent. Scoti. l. 4. Dist. 11. Q. 3. disp. 42. Sect. 1.</note> 
               <hi>an approved Authour of theirs,</hi> In primitiva Ecclesia de
substantia fidei erat, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It was of the substance of Faith
in the primitive Church, to believe that the Body of Christ
was contained under the <hi>species</hi> of Bread and Wine; but it
was not of Faith, that the substance of the Bread should
be turned into the Body of Christ, and upon Consecration
should not be Bread. For, <hi>saith he,</hi> this was not found out
by the Church till the time of <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, in the
Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> where many Truths that before lay hid
are explained in the Chap. of <hi>Firmiter Credimus,</hi> amongst
which this of Transubstantiation is the chief. <hi>So also saith</hi>
Peter Tataret<note n="‖" place="margin">Com. in 4. Sent. p. 101. col. 1. Ven. 1607. <hi>and</hi> p. 142. col. 1.</note>. And this was the Opinion of <hi>Scotus</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">In 4 Sent. dist 11. q. 3. <hi>SS.</hi> ad ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. pro prima &amp; dist. 10. q. 1. <hi>SS.</hi> quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum ergo.</note>,
<hi>the great Schoolman.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now it is supposed that <hi>Scotus,</hi> who lived within 150
Years after, must better understand what was the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of their Church before it, and what was the sense
of that Council concerning it, than he that comes about
450 Years after, and chides him for so doing, with a
<hi>minime probandum</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min l. 3. de Euchar. c. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>.</note>.</p>
            <p>4. The Doctrine of Infallibility, respecting their
Church as the Seat of it, was not anciently known, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
claimed by themselves, nor granted by others.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:41168:5"/>
Amongst all the directions given in Scripture for finding
out the truth, there is not one word to this purpose;
and amongst all the Disputes in the Primitive Church,
we find no such course taken for the final determination
of them, as the having recourse to the Apostolical Chair
of <hi>Rome.</hi> Heresies were not then so scarce, nor the
confutation of them so easie, as that this relief should be
forgotten. And it seems they themselves did then as
little understand their own Privileges, as they did the
Principles of Faith; for this was never so much as
thought of, in all those Councils which were called on
purpose for the suppression of Heresies, and where the
Legats of the Pope were present: Nay to this very day
they are at a loss where to go for it, whether to the
Pope, or a Council, or both, or Tradition, or the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective
Body of Christians; that is, they know not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to give up the Cause or to maintain it. I must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess,
if I should hear a person solemnly declare, that he
hath Treasure enough in his possession to enrich the whole
World, and should gravely invite all persons to address
themselves to him, but in the mean time perceive (though
he hath been of the same Mind for several Years,) that
he can neither tell where it is, nor is he and his Family
for all this the richer, or in a better condition than
other Folk, I should vehemently suspect him either to be
a notorious Impost or, or perfect Lunatick. And when
we hear the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> confidently asserting its
own Infallibility, but find withall that she knows not
where to fix it, and that its ruptures and differences are
in the mean time as great as in other Churches, and
what are never ended by the way it pretends to, but by
plain downright force, I cannot for my heart but think
there is for the most part more of Interest than Reason
in the Case, and what they themselves do rather live by
than believe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:41168:6"/>
But in my mind there is no better Evidence that this
is <hi>new,</hi> than that it's false; and no better evidence that
it is false, than that it hath mistaken. Of which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides
what hath been, or shall be farther said of alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in that Church, I shall give you two plain Instances,
The Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">Sess. 4. d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

was a Tradition in the Church for 600 Years after Christ;</hi>
which is now condemned (as he shews) by the Council of
<hi>Trent.</hi> Again, S. <hi>Hierom</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">In I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>a c 6. &amp;c. 8.</note> saith, that <hi>the Latine Church
then did not receive the Epistle to the</hi> Hebrews <hi>amongst
the Canonical Scriptures:</hi> But that is now taken into the
number by them, and required so to be under an Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
<hi>Sess. 4. Decr. 1. Conc. Trid.</hi> Now Infallibility and Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility
are contradictory, and if that Church hath erred,
(as erred she hath) then she cannot be infallible, and so
consequently the Infallibility of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was
not the Principle of the Primitive Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could shew as much of Novelty in the Doctrines of
Indulgences, Purgatory, the Mass's being a Propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
Sacrifice, and of no Salvation out of the <hi>Romish</hi>
Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but what I have said I think is sufficient.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The Alterations are as great in point of
Practice; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> differs therein as much
from what she originally was: As,</p>
            <p>1. The keeping the Scriptures and publick Service in
an unknown Tongue, is new. The first is evident from
the Translations of the Scripture into several Languages,
and especially into the Latine, (at that time a vulgar
Tongue) of which no sufficient Reason can be given,
were it not for the use of those that understood not the
Originals. The latter is not onely clear from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.
but what <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">De Verbo Dei, lib. 2. cap. 16.</note> doth acknowledge; who saith,
<hi>That the custome of the Peoples saying</hi> Amen, [that is to
what they understood,] <hi>as they did in the Apostles time,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:41168:6"/>
continued long in the Western as well as Eastern Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Worshipping of Images, which was first established
in the second Council at <hi>Nice,</hi> but is so different from
and contrary to the practice of the Primitive Church, that
<hi>Cassander</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">Consult. Artic 21. sect. 4.</note> (an Authour of theirs) saith, <hi>that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians
had not then so much as Images in their Churches;</hi>
and doth farther declare from <hi>Origen,</hi> that the Ancients
<hi>ab omni veneratione</hi> (the very word used by the Council
of <hi>Trent, Sess. 25. decret, de Invocat.) imaginum abhorru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erunt,</hi>
that all Veneration of them was abhorred. To
this I refer the worshipping of Saints, which was so
little thought of, that many of the Fathers did not
think that the Souls of any should enjoy the beatifick
Vision, and be in a state of happiness till the Resurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
as <hi>Stapleton</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Defens. Eccl. cont. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> l. 1. c. 2. Tom. 1. p. 868.</note> doth shew. And it seems not to
have been an Article of Faith in the time either of <hi>Lom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard</hi>
or <hi>Scotus,</hi> the former of which saith<note n="‖" place="margin">Sent. l. 4. dist. 45.</note> 
               <hi>It's not incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
the Saints do hear what we say;</hi> and the latter<note n="*" place="margin">In 4. dist. 45. Q 4.</note> that
<hi>it's probable God doth reveal our prayers that are offered
unto them.</hi> It was then the Doctrine of probability one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but now all are required to believe it under an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema,
by the Council of <hi>Trent</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">Sess. 25. de Invocat.</note>.</p>
            <p>As much is to be said concerning the Innovation of
Worship to the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> of which we read nothing
in Scripture or Antiquity, unless in what was practised
by the Hereticks, called <hi>Collyridiani</hi> in <hi>Epiphanius</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">Haeres. 79.</note>,
that used to carry about her Image, and offer Cakes and
Worship to it; with whom that good Father thus
encounters: <hi>What Scripture hath delivered any such
thing,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Let</hi> Mary <hi>be in honour, but let the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost be worshipped; let no man
worship</hi> Mary.</p>
            <p>3. Communion in one Kind expresly contrary to the
Scripture, and the former practice of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church.
The former is acknowledged by the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi>
               <note n="*" place="margin">Sess. 13.</note> when they decreed with a <hi>notwithstanding</hi> for it.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:41168:7"/>
The latter is acknowledged by <hi>Cassander</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="margin">Artic. 22.</note>, who saith,
<hi>That the</hi> Roman <hi>Church it self retained the practice of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
in both Kinds, for above one thousand years after
Christ, as is evident from innumerable testimonies of anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Writers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To these I might add the practice of saying private
and solitary Masses, of the Adoration of the Host, and
carrying it about in Procession, Confession, (as used in
their Church,) <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But I shall forbear.</p>
            <p>III. These alterations are to the worse; and gross Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions.
For if the Pope is not Christ's Vicar original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and by his Deputation, then he is so far a great Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
If he hath not a Power over Kings, to depose them,
and absolve their Subjects from Allegiance to them, then
those of them that have used that power have been noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
disturbers of the World. If their Church be not infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
and can no more penetrate into, or resolve and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
points of Faith than another, they do deceive and
are deceived. If Transubstantiation be a Doctrine of their
own, and not of Christ's, they usurp upon his Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.
If the Scriptures are free to all, then their Church
is guilty of the damnation of all amongst themselves,
that perish through the want of knowing and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
them; and of all the ignorance in the Christian
World, which proceeds from that cause. If worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
Images, Saints and Angels, the Host, and Reliques,
be not Christian Doctrine, and that these are no lawful
Objects of such Worship, then they are Idolaters. If
Christians are obliged to partake of the Wine as well as
the Bread in the Lord's Supper, then what are they that
deny and forbid it? In fine, they that doe such things
are no Friends to the Kingdom of Christ and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian
World.</p>
            <p>If all this be true, that a Church may fall from what
it once was, and be altered to the worse, and that theirs
is so, then we need not spend time in disputing what
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:41168:7"/>
               <hi>Apostasie, Heresie</hi> and <hi>Schism</hi> is, upon which we may
talk prettily and subtilly; or by which of them that
Church is faln, as long as faln she is. But yet to clear
the matter of all wrangling Disputes, I shall consider
these things also; and shew,</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the particulars are very fallacious;
which will appear from the consideration of the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Terms.</p>
            <p>1. <hi>Most pure, excellent, flourishing Mother-Church;</hi>
of all which little or nothing is said in the places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
quoted by him in the Margin. If we consult the
Epistle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> there referred to, we shall find,
That it was so far from being at that time a <hi>flourishing
Church,</hi> that it is there not once so much as called a
Church. The Apostle directs two Epistles to the Church
in <hi>Corinth,</hi> and two to the Church of the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi>
and one to the Churches of <hi>Galatia;</hi> but to the <hi>Romans</hi>
he writes thus, <hi>Ch. 1. v. 7. To all that be in</hi> Rome, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
of God, called to be Saints;</hi> as if they were yet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts
at large, without any other setled Constitution,
than what was in the House of <hi>Aquila,</hi> which he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
calls a Church, <hi>Ch. 16. v.</hi> 5. And therefore <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron,</hi>
aware of it, thinks St. <hi>Paul</hi> would not call them
a Church purposely, <hi>because of the Factions that were
there at that time betwixt the</hi> Jews <hi>and</hi> Gentiles.
<hi>Tom. 13. in Rom. 1. disp. 7. p. 299. col.</hi> 2.</p>
            <p>But if we should grant it a Church; yet how doth
that, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 8. prove that it was <hi>flourishing,</hi> when it's
onely said there, <hi>Your Faith is spoken of throughout the
whole World;</hi> and <hi>in Ch. 16. v.</hi> 19. (for I suppose that
is the other place he would refer to) <hi>Your obedience is
come abroad unto all Men;</hi> by which doubtless no more is
to be understood, but that the Conversion of many to
Christianity in that City was spread throughout the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
World; and did tend much to the propagation of
it, as that City was then the Imperial Seat.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:41168:8"/>
This is the explication given of this place by some of
their own Writers, <hi>viz. Rigaltius,</hi> in his Notes upon
St. <hi>Cyprian, Epist. p.</hi> 78. and <hi>Tolet,</hi> who in <hi>c. 1. ad
Rom. Annot.</hi> 16. call it a true <hi>Exposition,</hi> and saith it's
to be understood as 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 1. 8.</p>
            <p>As for the Term <hi>Mother,</hi> I hope he means not that
the Gospel first came from thence; for in that sense she
was a Daughter, and not a Mother. And if any Church
could pretend to any Authority from that consideration,
it must be <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> which in this sense was the <hi>Mother
of us all.</hi> But if he means thereby that she was an Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
and Apostolical Church, planted by the Apostles,
or in Apostolical times (for so <hi>Tertullian</hi> useth these
Words alike, <hi>lib. de praescript. cap.</hi> 21. when he calls
them <hi>Matrices &amp; Originales Ecclesiae,</hi> and again <hi>Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siae
Apostolicae</hi>) then such also was <hi>Ephesus</hi> in <hi>Asia,</hi> and
<hi>Corinth</hi> in <hi>Achaia,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Tertullian</hi> there shews, <hi>c.</hi> 32,
and 36. of which Churches it will be hard for him to
find any thing remaining, and which, while they did
remain, he must acknowledge to have faln, and been
grosly corrupted. And therefore <hi>Rome</hi>'s being a <hi>Mother</hi>
Church, in this sense, is no security against <hi>Apostasie,
Heresie</hi> and <hi>Schism.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. <hi>Apostasie,</hi> he saith, <hi>is a renouncing not onely the
Faith of Christ, but the very Name and Title to Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi>
This indeed is Apostasie with a Witness; but as it
is no more than a Branch or particular kind of it, so it
can be no complete or true definition of it. It being
just as if he should say, that Theft is the violent and
forcible taking away of another Man's Goods; which
indeed is the highest degree of it, and what we usually
call Robbery; but there are other sorts of Theft besides;
and though it be never so surreptitiously and clandestine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
done, it is as well Theft, and a breach of the Eighth
Commandment as the other. So it is in the present
case; the highest degree of Apostasie is a renouncing the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:41168:8"/>
very name of Christian, the turning a <hi>Renegado,</hi> a <hi>Turk,</hi>
or <hi>Jew:</hi> But that is Apostasie also, when there is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from the Faith of Christ, or from any great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle
or Articles of it. And so far a person may be tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an Apostate, and yet <hi>retain the Name and Title to
Christianity.</hi> I must confess, I always took those to be
Apostates, whom the Apostle speaks of, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. 1.
that <hi>depart from the Faith of Christ,</hi> who yet seem to
have continued in the profession of it. And I am apt
to believe Antichrist will be thought an Apostate; and
yet it's the opinion of many among themselves, that he
shall retain the name of Christian. But if this will not
doe, I must refer him to the <hi>Bulla Coenae</hi> of Pope <hi>Paul</hi>
the Fifth, where it's said in the first Article of it, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicamus,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>We excommunicate and anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,</hi>
&amp;c. <hi>all</hi> Hussites, Wicklevists, Lutherans, Zuingli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Calvinists, Hugonots, Anabaptists, Trinitarians,
<hi>&amp; à Christiana fide Apostatas, ac omnes &amp; singulos alios
Haereticos,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and all Apostates from the Christian
Faith, and all other Hereticks,</hi> &amp;c. which is doubtless
spoken of such as have not, nor are supposed to have
renounced the Name and Title to Christianity. So that
either the Pope in one of his most solemn Bulls is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken,
or this Gentleman: And if we take to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,
as I hope he either in modesty, or for a more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant
reason which he is privy to, will allow, then
the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> may be faln by Apostasie, though
she doth retain the Name and Title, and will needs be
the onely Church of Christ.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Heresie,</hi> he saith, <hi>is an adhesion to some private or
singular Opinion or Errour in Faith, contrary to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
approved Doctrine of the Church.</hi> Before we admit
this Definition, there are a great many things to be
considered; as first, that the relation which he makes
Heresie to have to the Doctrine of the Church, is not
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:41168:9"/>
current amongst themselves. For many of them do say,
that Heresie is <hi>Nihil aliud quàm Error in rebus fidei cum
pertinacia, Heresie is nothing else than an Errour in the
matters of Faith with obstinacy,</hi> as <hi>Sayrus</hi> acknowledgeth
in his <hi>Clavis Sacerdotum, l. 2. c. 9. n.</hi> 34. and <hi>Durand</hi> is
of the same mind (notwithstanding what <hi>Sayrus</hi> saith
of him to the contrary) as appears <hi>l. 4. dist. 13. Q.</hi> 5.
where he makes the respect which Heresie hath to the
Church, to be <hi>because the Church is constituted, per uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem
fidei, by the unity of the Faith:</hi> So that accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to these, the respect which Heresie hath to the
Church, is onely from the respect which the Church
hath to the Faith: And to find out what Heresie is, we
must enquire not what the Church is, but what is the
Faith. And if so, a Church, even that of <hi>Rome,</hi> may
fall by Heresie, though she may hold the general appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
Doctrine of the Church. But I doubt, if we should
admit the whole, and yet take it in any sense but one,
<hi>viz.</hi> for the general approved Doctrine of the Church
of <hi>Rome</hi> in the last Ages of it, that we shall find her
guilty in this point also. Shall the Church be taken for
the primitive Church three or four hundred years after
our Saviour, then they are guilty of Heresie who will
have the Pope to be Christ's Vicar, and to have Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
over all Churches; that do maintain worshipping
of Images, Angels and Saints, to be lawful and necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> contrary to the general approved Doctrine of
those Ages. Should we take the Church for the
Church Catholick in any Age (as <hi>Cassander</hi> doth, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult.
Artic.</hi> 22.) that is, the Congregation of Christ's
faithful people all over the World, then still <hi>Rome</hi> would
fall into the same condemnation, since that she is but a
little part in comparison of the whole. Should we take
<hi>Church</hi> again for the <hi>Romish</hi> Church in the first Ages of
Christianity, it would then also condemn it self, as I
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:41168:9"/>
have before shewed. And I see no way for them, even
according to this definition, (which is perfectly one of
their own making) to avoid this imputation, but by
stifly maintaining, that they thereby understand the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> for some Ages last past; if that will
doe; and then we know where to find them, and what
to understand when they talk of the Church.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>Schism,</hi> he saith, <hi>is a departure from the Vnity of
the Church whereby the Band and Communion held with
some former Church is broken.</hi> This is as lame and falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
a definition as any of the rest. For by foisting in
that word <hi>Former,</hi> which he after runs upon, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strains
it to one particular Branch of Schism; and it's just
as if he should say, <hi>A Church is an Assembly of Christians
that join in Communion with each other in the City of</hi>
Rome; which none will allow to be a sufficient defini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Church: For that term added, <hi>In the City of</hi>
Rome, doth no more than prove that the Assembly of
Christians there met is a Church; but is no definition
of a Church; for then no Church could be out of the
City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and every Church, if it be a Church,
must be in that City, and no where else, if that be a
true definition of it. So it is here, the word <hi>Former</hi>
added to the definition of Schism here given, doth prove
no more than that a departure from the Unity of a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
Church is a <hi>species</hi> and sort of Schism, but is no ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
definition of it. For if it is, then no Church can
be guilty of Schism, that doth, how unwarrantably so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
refuse to hold Communion with, or doth break
off from the Communion of a Church that was not a
Church before it. And consequently, though the
Church of <hi>Jerusalem</hi> had denied to hold Communion
with any Church whatsoever, (though it were even
with the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> it self,) she could not be
guilty of Schism, because she was the first Church, and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:41168:10"/>
none was prior to her. And we also should be quit of
that blame (if we had nothing else to say for our selves)
forasmuch as a Church was founded here in <hi>Britain</hi>
two years before that of <hi>Antioch;</hi> and St. <hi>Peter</hi> was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
years at <hi>Antioch</hi> before he presided at <hi>Rome,</hi> as <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronius</hi>
saith, <hi>An. 35. Num.</hi> 5. and <hi>An. 39. Numb.</hi> 23.
from whom, and from which time they pretend alone
to derive their Supremacy.</p>
            <p>And now this will hold, although the Church thus
separated from had given no reason or colour at all for it.
For according to the definition of our Authour, it must
be a <hi>Former Church</hi> which the departure must be from
to make it Schism. We may indeed say, that Schism
is when the Band or Communion held with any Church,
is (without just reason) broken and dissolved; because all
Christian Churches ought to maintain Communion with
each other, where it may be had: But if so, then the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is the most Schismatical in the World,
that denies Communion with all Churches that are not
in all <hi>Tridentine</hi> points one with her.</p>
            <p>If you now, Sir, reflect upon his Scheme and frame
of Arguments, you will see that they hold in nothing
which he produceth them for.</p>
            <p>For what will it signifie, if it be granted that the
Church of <hi>Rome</hi> was once a most pure, flourishing
Church, if she be now abominably corrupted? What
if she was a Mother-Church planted by the Apostles,
and watered with their Doctrine, and their Bloud,
when she now preacheth another Doctrine than she
was taught by them, and hath grosly corrupted that
Faith which they did there establish? What if she was
a Mother-Church to some other Churches, yet, that as
it gives her no Authority over those whom she was not
in any sense a Mother to, so even not over such as she
might pretend that Relation to, when she is now not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:41168:10"/>
to be approached to, or held Communion with, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
apparent hazard of Salvation; and is faln from
those Principles and that Faith which she at their first
conversion instructed them in? When she is faln by
Apostasie, Heresie and Schism.</p>
            <p>By Apostasie, as she hath forsaken the Primitive
Church, and is not now what she originally was, either
in Faith or Manners.</p>
            <p>By Heresie, as she hath received new Articles of Faith,
that were not such before; and so obstinately persisted
therein, that she hath turned the Anathema upon all Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senters
in those points from her. Such Articles she hath
embraced, and doth now hold, as have been <hi>condemned
by Councils, wrote against by Fathers, and reproved by
Authority.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Some of these she was particularly charged with, and
reproved for; and in others she is as much concerned,
as if particularly charged, because she hath embraced
those things which were by them condemned. For if
the things and principles were condemned, whoever holds
them is as much so condemned by that Authority, as if
particularly named. As they will acknowledge, that if
a Church now in Communion with them should fall off
from them, she is thereby as much under the <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>
of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> as if she had at the meeting
of that Council been so far faulty, and thereby been
particularly condemned.</p>
            <p>By Schism she is faln, as she denies Communion with
all other Churches in the World, whether they were so
before she was a Church, or were Churches converted
and established at the same time with her, or that have
embraced the Christian Faith since she did. The
company of such she hath left: From these Bodies she
is gone forth: And these were the true Churches which
she forsook. So that she will be found as often guilty of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:41168:11"/>
Apostasie, as there are particulars of Faith, Doctrine,
Worship and Manners, which she is fallen from the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive
Church in. As often of Heresie, as she hath
new Principles of Faith, and which the Church was not
then acquainted with. As often of Schism, as there are
Churches in the World, that she will not hold Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with, onely because they will not embrace those
Principles, or join with her in those practices which she
holds contrary to them, and with them to the Primitive
Church.</p>
            <p>And thus, Sir, I have made good, I hope, what I
first undertook, and if thereby any service can be done
to you or our Religion, it will be a great satisfaction to,</p>
