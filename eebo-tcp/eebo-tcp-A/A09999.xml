            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

In all which, what hath beene done by this Reverend and worthy man, we had rather should appeare in the Treatise it selfe, to thy indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent iudgement, then to bee much in setting downe our owne opinion. This we doubt not of, that, by reason of the spirituall, and convincing manner of handling this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it will winne acceptance with many, especially consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, that it is of that nature, wherein, though much haue beene spoken, yet much more may be said with good relish to those that haue anie spirituall sense: for it is the most spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall action, wherein wee haue nearer communion with</hi> God, <hi>then in anie other holie performance, and whereby it

Onelie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that we let these Sermons passe forth as they were delivered by himselfe, in publicke, without taking that li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of adding or detracting, which, perhaps, some would haue thought meete: for wee thought it best that his owne meaning should be expressed in his owne words and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, especially considering there is little which perhaps may seeme superfluous <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

It would be a good prevention of manie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences, in this kinde, if able men would bee perswa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to publish their owne works in their life time, yet wee thinke it a good service to the Church, when that defect is supplied by giving some life to those things, which otherwise would haue died of themselues.

Hee is an idle man that workes not, when hee ought to worke; So hee is sayde not to pray continually that prayes not when hee ought to pray.

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:6314:11"/>
that the <hi>Lord</hi> might be vvorshipped, (wherein we should follow that example of worshipping him morning and evening.) But likewise our occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are such, that that is the least we can doe to <note place="margin">2</note> call vpon him constantly morning and evening: for there is no day but we vse many blessings, and vve take many of his creatures. Now vvee may not take any of them without his leaue; so that thou art bound to aske for them before thou take them, and pray for a blessing vpon them; or else thou hast no right to them, thou hast no lawfull vse of them, that place is plaine, 1. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4. <hi>Everie</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim: 4:</note> 
                  <hi>Creature of God is good, and ought not to bee refused, if it be receiued with thanksgiuing: for it is sanctified by prayer.</hi> So that, if you take common blessings e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day, and doe not seeke them at the <hi>Lords</hi> hands before you take them, they are not sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed vnto you, you haue not a lawfull vse of them, you haue no right vnto them.</p>
               <p>Besides, my beloued, It is that which the Lord commands in every thing, <hi>Make your requests</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">3</note> 
                  <hi>knowne in every thing,</hi> that is, vvhensoever you need any thing, make your requests knowne; so <hi>in every thing giue thankes.</hi> And therfore the least we can doe vvhen vve have received, and do need so many mercies, is to give thankes, and to seek to him so often, from day to day.</p>
               <p>Moreover, doe not our hearts need it, are they not ready to goe out of order, are they not ready to contract hardnesse, are they not ready to goe from the <hi>Lord,</hi> and to bee hardned from <hi>Gods</hi> feare. Therefore this duty is needfull, in that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:6314:12"/>
to compose them, and bring them backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine into order.</p>
               <p>More ouer, doe not the sinnes we commit dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, put a necessity vpon vs, of doing this, that they <note place="margin">5</note> may be forgiuen, and done away, and that wee may be reconciled to <hi>God</hi> againe? Therefore do not thinke that it is an arbitrary thing to call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>God</hi> twice a day, because there is no particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar expresse command; for, if you consider these places that I haue named, and the reasons, wee shall see there is a necessitie lyes vpon vs to doe it. So much shall serue for that, I come novv to make some vse of this that hath beene deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered.</p>
               <p>First, in that such <hi>prayers,</hi> as the <hi>Lord</hi> accepts, are an expression of holy desires, such desires as rise <note place="margin">Vse 1.</note> from the regenerate part of a man; Hence then we see that all natural men are in a miserable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, when times of extreamitie come; and when the day of death comes, when there is no helpe in the world, but seeking to the <hi>Lord,</hi> when all the creatures forsake them, and are not able to helpe them; and there is no way to goe to the <hi>Lord</hi> but by prayer; if prayer bee an effect, and fruit of the regenerate part of a man, a carnal man is not able to helpe himselfe, hee is in a miserable condition. Therefore let men consider this that put all off to times of extreamitie. Put the case, thou hast warning enough, at such a time. Put the case thou hast the vse of thy vnderstanding, yet thou art not able to doe any good without this: For, if there be not grace in the heart, thou art
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:6314:12"/>
not able to make a spirituall prayer to the <hi>Lord,</hi> that the Lord accepts. Therefore take heede of deferring, and putting off. Labour to bee rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, to haue your hearts renewed, while you haue time, and if thou bee not able to call vpon <hi>God</hi> in the time of health, how wilt thou doe it when thy wits, and thy spirit are spent, and lost, and in the times of sicknes and extreamity: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let that be considered, which we do but touch by the way briefly.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if the Lord command this, if it bee the command of God: <hi>Pray continually:</hi> Then <note place="margin">Vse 2.</note> take heed of neglecting this duty, rather bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to be frequent and servent in it, to <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue therein, and watch there to with all perseuerance.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 6:</note> It is a common fault amongst vs, either wee are ready to omit it, or to come to it vnwillingly, or <note place="margin">Motiues to prayer:</note> else we performe it in a carelesse, and negligent manner, not considering, what a command lyeth vpon the sonnes of men to performe it constantly and conscionably. I beseech you consider this, that it is a priviledge purchased by the blood of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> Christ dyed for this end, it cost him the shedding of his blood, <hi>That wee through him,</hi>

If you doe, so farre as is in you, you cause his blood to be shed in vaine: for, if you neglect the priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges gotten by that blood, so farre you neglect the blood, that procured them; but to neglect this duty is to neglect that. Besides, if wee aske you <note place="margin">Mot. 2.</note> the reason; why you abstaine from other sins, why

you steale not, why you commit not adulterie, and murther; The reason that you giue, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>If you make conscience of one commandeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, why doe you not of another? consider <hi>Daniel</hi> in <note place="margin">Dan: 6:</note> this case, <hi>Dan.</hi> 6. hee would not omit a constant course of prayer, he did it 3. times a dayes, &amp; that was his ordinary custome. If he would not omit it to spare his life, if he would not omit it in such a case of danger as that, why will you omit it for businesse, for a little aduantage, for a little gaine, for a little wealth or pelie, or pompe or pleasure, or whatsoever may draw you from that duty? doe but consider what an vnreaso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, and how vnequall a thing it is, that when the <hi>Lord</hi> giues vs meate and drinke, and cloathes, from day to day, when he giues vs sleepe, euerie night, when hee prouides for vs such comforts, as wee haue neede of (as there is not the least creature that doth vs any service, but as farre as he sets it a worke to doe that service) for vs to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get him, and not to giue him thankes, and not to ask these things at his hands, not to seeke vnto him, but to liue as <hi>without God in the world,</hi> as we do, when we neglect this duty. I say, it is a professi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note place="margin">Eph: 2:</note> of living without <hi>God</hi> in the world; wee are strangers to him, it is open rebellion against him. Therefore take heed of omitting it, take heed of neglecting it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:6314:13"/>
Besides all this, wee should doe it for our <note place="margin">3. Mot.</note> owne sakes, if wee consider what vse we haue of this duty for our selues. Is it not the key that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peneth all Gods treasures? when heaven was shut vp, was not this the key that opened? when the wombes were shut vp, was not this it that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened? you know, <hi>Eliah prayed for raine,</hi> so wee may say for every other blessing. All Gods trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures are lockt vp, to those that doe not call vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his name, this opens the doore to them all, whatsoever they be that we haue occasion to vse, this is effectuall; it doth it better then any thing besides. If a man be sicke, I will be bold to say it, a faithfull prayer is more able to heale his disease then the best medicine, <hi>The prayer of faith shall heale the sicke. Iam</hi> 5. you know, the woman that <note place="margin">Iames 5:</note> had the bloody issue, when she had spent al vpon Phisitians, and could doe no good; Then shee comes to Christ, and offered faithfull prayer to him, that did it, when so many years phisick could not do it, beloued, if there be a Prince or a great man, whose mindwe would haue turned towards vs, a faithfull prayer will doe it sooner then the best friends.

I adde this to all I prest in the morning, <note place="margin">6. <hi>Mot.</hi> The omission of it doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage men:</note> that if you doe neglect it, it exposeth you to great disadvantage, both for the outward man, and for the inward man, and there are but these two that you need to care for.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:6314:17"/>
For the outward man, it deprives you of the blessing; put the case, you haue never so good <note place="margin">1 In the outward man.</note> successe in your enterprizes; put the case you haue outward comforts in abundance, yet still the blessing is wanting, and not onely so, but it vncovers the roofe, as it were, and the curse is rayned downe vpon your tables, vpon your meat and drinke, vpon all the endeavours, and all the enterprizes you take in hand. We consider not what we doe, when we neglect this duty, what dangers we expose our selues vnto from day to day: for it is one thing to haue outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and another thing to haue the blessing with them.</p>
               <p>Besides, consider what losse you suffer in the inward man, when you neglect this duty at any <note place="margin">2 In the inward man.</note> time: for that is ready to be distempered; and to goe out of order, it is ready to contract hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to contract soile, spirituall grace is ready to decay. It falls out with mans heart, as it doth with a garden that is neglected; it will quickly be overcome with weedes, if you looke not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently <note place="margin">Simile.</note> to it, and the way to looke to it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy in this duty.

surely, saith he, thou restrainest prayer from the <hi>Lord;</hi> So it is with vs, let vs restraine prayer from <hi>God,</hi> and distempers will arise quickly in our spirits, worldly mindednesse will bee ready to grow vpon vs, wee shall be apt to be carnall, we shall forget <hi>God,</hi> and forget our selues, and forget the good purposes, and desires wee had; and therefore, that you may keepe your hearts in order, you must keepe a constant course in this duty: for if you doe (though your peace be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted) this will repaire it againe, it will make vp the breaches againe; though there bee some distempered affections, that grow vpon vs, yet prayer will compose all. As sleepe composeth <note place="margin">Simile.</note> drunkennesse: so prayer will compose the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, a man may pray himselfe sober againe, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth it sooner, nothing doth it more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually; and this you shall finde, that as you, ey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther omit it, or slight it over; so you shall finde a proportionable weaknesse growing vpon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, as the body feeles, when it neglecteth either sleepe, or diet, or exercise: therefore, to end this exhortation, let vs bee constant in it.</p>
               <p>Onely remember this (when wee exhort you thus to keepe a constant course, for which you heard so many reasons in the morning, I say, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this caution) that if it be performed in a <note place="margin">No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

If a man send his servant to goe to such a place, it is not his going to and fro that <note place="margin">Simile.</note> he regards, but hee would haue him to dispatch the businesse; so in all other workes, hee cares not for the formalitie of performance, but would haue the thing so done, that it may bee of vse to him; if you set a servant to make a fire <note place="margin">Simile.</note> for you, and he goe, and lay some greene wood together, and perhaps put a few coales vnder, this is not to make a fire for you, but hee must, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther get dry wood, or he must blow till it burne, and be fit for vse; so when your hearts are vnfit, when they are like greene wood, when you come to warme them, and to quicken them by prayer to <hi>God,</hi> it may be, you post over this dutie, and leaue your hearts as cold, and as distempered as they were before: My beloved, this is not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme this dutie. The dutie is effectuallie perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, when your hearts are wrought vpon by it, &amp; when they are brought to a better tune, and to a better temper then they were before.

When <hi>Adam</hi> was in <hi>Paradise,</hi> the having of <hi>Gods Image,</hi> you know, it excelled all other excellencies in the world and so it doth still, and the more you pray, the more you get of this image: for a man of much praier is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies a man of much grace, it much increaseth those spirituall gifts, which are better then al the outward things you can get by your imploiment and diligence in them: therefore, I say, though it doe spend you much time; yet know (as <hi>Christ</hi> said to <hi>Mary)</hi> he that praies much, though he be a great looser in other things, yet he <hi>chooseth the better part.</hi>

               <p>Oh, but, a man will say further, I am willing <note place="margin">Obiect. 1.</note> to doe it, but I am vnfit for it, and it may be the longer I striue, the more vnfit I grow.</p>
               <p>To this I answer, first, in generall, if thou doe it as well as thou canst, though thou do it not so <note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> well as thou wouldest, in this case, <hi>God accepts the will for the deed,</hi> when a man puts his strength to it, when there is no indiligence in him, when there is no lazinesse (for in that case he will not accept the will for the deed, but) when a man doth his vtmost, as those that would haue giuen more, and could not, their will was accepted for the deed, in 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 8. 12. I say, when thou doest what thou canst, when thou sparest no labour to <note place="margin">2 Cor. 8: 12, 13</note> get thy heart vpon the wing, to raise and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en it, and to inlarge it in this dutie: there <hi>God</hi> accepts it. <note place="margin">Ans. 2.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But againe, I adde further, there is an vnskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse in going about this dutie: many times when we are not fit, we thinke to make our selues fitter, by spending time in thoughts, and medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations before, which I denie not but they may be profitable, but yet this I will propound to you
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:6314:20"/>
that the best way to fit our selues to this duty, <note place="margin">How to fit a mans selfe to prayer.</note> when we finde an indisposition vnto it, is, not to stay till we haue prepared our selues by medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but to fall presently vpon the dutie, (I will giue you the reason of it) because, though a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is required for the performance of eues rie spirituall dutie, yet, the remote preparation is that which is intended, and meant, when we say we must prepare: for, if we speake of that which is immediate, the very doing of the dutie is the first preparation to it. For example, if a man were to runne a race, if he were to doe any bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Simile.</note> exercise, there must be strength of bodie, hee must be fed well, that he may haue abilitie, but the vse of the very exercise it selfe, the very parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular act, that is of the same kind with the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise, is the best to fit him for it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> so in this duty of prayer, it is true, to be <hi>strong in the inward man,</hi> to haue much knowledge, to haue much grace, makes a man able, and fit for the dutie; but, if you speake of the immediate preparation for it, I say, the best way to prepare vs, is the very dutie it selfe; as all actions, of the same kinde, increase the habits, so prayer makes vs fit for prayer; and that is a rule, <hi>the way to godlinesse is in the compasse</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Note.</note> 
                  <hi>of godlinesse it selfe,</hi> that is, the way to grow in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grace is the exercise of that grace.</p>
               <p>It is a point that <hi>Luther</hi> pressed, and hee pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it out of his owne experience, and this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <note place="margin">Note this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</note> he vseth; in this case, saith he, when a man goes about to fit himselfe, by working on his owne thoughts, now he goes about to overcome
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:6314:21"/>
himselfe by his owne strength, and to contend with <hi>Sathan</hi> alone, but when a man feeleth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition, and goes to <hi>God</hi> by prayer, &amp; rests on <hi>God</hi> to fit him, he takes <hi>Gods</hi> strength to oppose the indisposition, and deadnes of his flesh, &amp; the temptations of Sathan, that hinder him, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists him. Therefore you shall find this to be the best way to fit your selues for prayer, namely, to performe the duty. If you seeke to expedite, and devolue your selues, out of your vnfitnes, by the working of your own thoughts, commonly, you involue your selues farther into those labyrinths, and are caught more and more. But this I speake by the way concerning matters of vnfitnes. The maine answer to this obiection is that, which I gaue you before, that if a man doe what hee can, and do it faithfully, and in sinceritie, that indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition shall not hinder him, but still remember, it must be done, it is not an excuse to vs, at any time, nor ought to be, that wee should omit the duty wholy, vnder pretence of an vnfitnes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, a man is ready to say againe, but I <note place="margin">3 Obiect.</note> find many difficulties, how shall I doe to remove them?</p>
               <p>The best way hereunto, is the very naming of the difficulties to you, that you may know them, <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> 7 impediments of prayer, that makes it dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult.</note> and make account of them; therefore you must consider this in generall, that, indeede, it is not an easie thing to call vpon <hi>God</hi> constantly: our misprision of the dutie, our reckoning of it, that it is a more facile, and easie thing, then it is, makes vs more to slight it, and causeth
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:6314:21"/>
vs not to goe about it with that intention, which otherwise we would, but consider a little what <note place="margin">1 Note that.</note> it is. The dutie is very spirituall, and our hearts are carnall, and it is no easie thing to bring spirituall duties, and carnall hearts toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Besides, our natures are very backward to come into the <hi>Lords</hi> presence, partly by reason of his <note place="margin">2</note> great glory, by reaso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of his M<hi rend="sup">ty</hi>, who <hi>dwels in light <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>Again, the variety of occasions hinders vs, eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <note place="margin">3</note> thing keepes vs back; if a mans heart be cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, it is apt to delight in other things; if a mans heart be sad, on the other side; if it bee a slight sadnes, men are ready to driue it away with company, and with sports, and with doing other things, and if the sadnesse be great, we are swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed vp with anguish of spirit, and then any thing is easier then to pray, as you may see by <hi>Iudas,</hi> it was easier for him to dispatch himselfe, then to goe and call vpon <hi>God;</hi> so it is with men, when they haue excessiue griefe, when their an guish of heart is exceeding great: so that, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a man hath a cheerefull disposition, or a sad, whether the sadnes bee great or small, still you shall finde a difficultie. If we be idle, &amp; haue
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:6314:22"/>
nothing to doe, our hearts will be possest with vaine thoughts, and, if we bee full of businesse, that distracts vs also, and indisposeth vs, on the other side: so still there are impediments.</p>
               <p>But there is one great impediment, among the rest, and most common, which is worldly cares, <note place="margin">4</note> and worldly-mindednes; worldly cares hinder spirituall prayer, and spirituall conference, and the holy performance, almost, of euery duty, and therefore, if you finde a difficultie in it, looke narrowly, if that be not the cause.</p>
               <p>Againe, another great cause of this difficultie in prayer, of such backwardnesse to it, of such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>disposition <note place="margin">5</note> to it, is, because we doe not well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the nature of <hi>God,</hi> we want faith in his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and in his prouidence we doe not consider, that he hath that disposing hand, which he hath in euery thing, that belongs to vs, in health, in sicknesse, in pouertie, in riches, in good successe, and ill successe: for, if we did see the prouidence of <hi>God,</hi> and acknowledge it more; we should be ready to call vpon him, but this want of faith in his providence, that the <hi>Lord</hi> is not seene in his greatnesse, and in his mightie power, this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth men to be backward to seeke him, but very forward to seeke to the creatures. When we haue any thing to doe, of any consequence, we are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to post from this man to that man, and from this meanes to that meanes, but very backward, and negligent to goe to <hi>God,</hi> in prayer, to haue the thing brought to passe, that wee desire, and this ariseth from want of faith, and from ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:6314:22"/>
of <hi>God,</hi> and our not consideration of him.</p>
               <p>Besides, Sathan hinders vs exceedingly in this <note place="margin">6</note> duty: for he knowes of what moment it is, and of what consequence, and therefore he doth as the <hi>Aramites</hi> did, hee <hi>fights not against small nor great, but against the King,</hi> he knowes it is this duty <note place="margin">1 King. 22. 31.</note> which quickens euery grace, it is the greatest e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy, which he hath, and if he can keepe vs from prayer, hee hath the vpper hand of vs, hee hath wrested the weapon out of our hands, hee hath disarmed vs, as it were, and then he may do what he will with vs.</p>
               <p>Likewise the sins we commit, especially grosse sinnes, they are a great hinderance to this duty, <note place="margin">7</note> and keepe from the spirituall, and cheerefull performance of it: for sinne wounds the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, it disioynteth, and dismembers the soule, and a disioynted member, you know, is vnfit to doe any businesse; yea, when the sinne is healed, and forgiven, yet there is a sorenesse left in the heart, though some assurance of pardon should follow, vpon the commission of a great sin, so that, that is another impediment. I must not stand to reckon vp many, we shall find enough by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall experience.</p>
               <p>Onely this vse we must make of it, that, if the <note place="margin">Vse.</note> impediments bee so many, and the difficulties that keepe vs from a constant course in prayer, <note place="margin">What course is to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these impediments.</note> and from the performance of it to purpose, so great, then we must put on a resolution to breake through all, and lay it, as an inviolable law vpon

and remoove it, wee could not spend an houre better.</p>
               <p>The obiections, that are commonly in the hearts of men, are many, I will name to you but these 4 briefly.</p>
               <p>First, a man is ready to say, what need I spend <note place="margin">1 Obiect.</note> so much time, and bee so large in the expression of my wants to <hi>God,</hi> when he knowes them? I cannot make them better knowne to him, hee knowes them well enough already, and therfore what needeth it?</p>
               <p>To this I answer (in a word, because it is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection <note place="margin">Ans.</note> that hath not much weight in it) that it is true; the <hi>Lord</hi> knowes thy wants, but withall, he will haue thee to know them; because, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, thou wilt not seeke to him, thou wilt not set a price vpon the things, that hee bestowes on thee, thou wilt not be thankefull to him, when he hath granted them, and therefore you shall finde, our Saviour Christ vseth this very argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as a meanes to quicken vs to prayer, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Your heavenly Father knowes what you haue</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>neede of,</hi> what then? shall we not therfore pray? yes, saith he, therefore pray ye the more earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the more importunately to him: for since he knowes your wants, he will be more ready to heare your requests.</p>
               <p>I, but, it will be said againe, that hee doth not only know them, but he also means, &amp; purposeth <note place="margin">2 Obiect.</note> to bestow them: for hee hath made a promise to vs, and his promise i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:6314:24"/>
hath fully purposed it, what needs so much pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bring it to passe?</p>
               <p>I answer, the promises of <hi>God</hi> are to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood <note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> with this secret condition annexed, I will doe such and such a thing for you, if you pray, though it be not expressed: and therefore, we see when <hi>God</hi> promised things in particular, yet still they prayed, and prayed earnestly. When he promised <hi>Elish</hi> that it should raine, yet, wee see, he prayed and contended much in his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <note place="margin">1 Kin 18. 41, 42</note> when he made a promise to <hi>David,</hi> that hee would <hi>make him a house,</hi> yet you know <hi>David</hi> went <note place="margin">2 Sam. 7. 11. 2 Sam. 7. 18.</note> to the house of the <hi>Lord,</hi> and sat before him, and made earnest prayer, as is recorded in the 2. of <hi>Sam.</hi> so <hi>Daniel</hi> had particular promise, and yet <note place="margin">Dan 9.</note> he prayed, and prayed long. The example of our Saviour <hi>Christ</hi> is without exception, who had all the promises sure to him, yet, you see, <hi>he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> yea, <hi>he spent whole nights in prayer,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you must so vnderstand it, that though you haue a promise made, though the thing be neuer so sure to you; yet it is to be vnderstood with that if you call vpon God.</p>
               <p>And why the <hi>Lord</hi> would haue you doe it. I shewed you many reasons in the morning, wee <note place="margin">Ans. 2.</note> will adde this to it. What, if the <hi>Lord</hi> will haue thee call vpon him, though hee purpose to doe the thing, even for this end, that thou maist wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for, what is it to worship the <hi>Lord?</hi> you shall finde this vsuall in the old Testament, <hi>The people <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

is this, to worship God is nothing else, but to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the worthinesse that is in him. As when you doe worship to a man, you doe vse so much outward demeanor &amp; observance to him, as may acknovvledge a vvorth in him aboue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man: outvvard gesture, that is the outward vvorshipping of God, the invvard vvorship is invvardly to acknovvledge his attributes. Novv, you shall see, prayer giues an acknowledgment of his attributes most of any thing: for hee that prayes to <hi>God,</hi> he doth, in so doing, acknowledge his <hi>omnipresence,</hi> and his <hi>omniscience;</hi> that hee heares that, which the Idols of the Gentils could not doe, that hee knowes the secrets of mens hearts, that neither men, nor Angels can doe:</p>
               <p>Againe, it acknowledgeth his Almightie po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, that hee is able to doe anie thing; for that is presupposed, when wee come, and seeke to him.</p>
               <p>Againe, it acknowledgeth his mercie, and his goodnes; that he is not onely able, but exceeding willing to helpe.</p>
               <p>Againe, it acknowledgeth his truth, that as he hath promised, so, I make account, hee will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, when I go, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>e to him, in a word, all the attributes of <hi>God</hi> are acknowledged in prayer. Therefore therein you worship him in a speciall manner, when you goe, and seek to him, and pray to him, in so doing, you acknowledge him, yea you acknowledge him to be a <hi>Lord,</hi> and a father, as when we see a childe run to a man, and aske him blessing, when we see him ask him

foode, and rayment, wee say, surely such a man is his father; so this very praying to <hi>God,</hi> is a worshipping of him, because it acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his attributes, and his relation to vs, and ours to him.</p>

So that, when you thinke you draw <hi>God</hi> to you, with your arguments, in truth, you draw <note place="margin">Simile.</note> your selues neerer to him; as when a man in a ship pluckes a rocke, it seemeth as as if he pluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the rocke neerer to the shippe, when as the shippe is plucked neerer the rocke: so, I say, wee draw our selues neerer to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and when wee draw neerer to the <hi>Lord,</hi> in prayer, and there is a spirituall disposition wrought in our hearts, by the exercise of this dutie, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede the <hi>Lord</hi> drawes neere to vs, to send vs helpe, and to grant our requests, that wee put vp to him, and therefore that you should marke by the way, that any prayer, as it hath a higher pitch of holinesse in affection, and as it hath stronger arguments in it; so it is a better prayer; not because this prayer shall prevayle with <hi>God</hi> more, or, that the excellencie of this prayer should moove him, but because this pitch of holie affection, and strength of argument workes vpon your hearts: for the strength of arguments mooues your vnderstanding, and the holinesse of affection puts your will in a

               <p>Againe, on the other side, he hath prayed for such and such things, and yet they haue not bin granted? so this obiection hath two parts, that a man hath obtained blessings, without prayer, and againe he hath prayed, and yet hath not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained <note place="margin">2</note> the blessings he sought for, at the <hi>Lords</hi> hands.</p>
               <p>For answer to the first, that men doe obtaine many blessings that doe not pray (as how many <note place="margin">Ans.</note> young men are there, and old men too, that haue health, and wealth, and peace, and libertie, and abundance of all things, and yet, eyther they <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

               <p>First, though they haue these blessings, yet they haue them <gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 word">

               <p>But I answer again (which is the chiefe answer <note place="margin">Answ. 2.</note> to this obiection) that there is a great deale of difference betweene hauing blessings, through the providence of <hi>God,</hi> and betweene hauing <note place="margin">Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween hauing of blessings through the prouidence of God, &amp; from the loue of God.</note> them from the mercie of <hi>God,</hi> and by vertue of his promise, and out of his loue to vs in <hi>Christ Iesus.</hi> A naturall man may haue many blessings of <hi>God,</hi> (so <hi>God</hi> said that he made <hi>Ieroboam</hi> a King, he gaue him a Kingdome, and many such passa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges we shall find, when men come vniustly to them, as he did to the Kingdome, yet <hi>God,</hi> saith he, did it, that is, it was by his providence) and yet he hath them not in mercie: for if thou hast these blessings, health, and sleepe, and successe in the enterprises, from day to day, and yet thy hart tells thee within, that thou hast not sought them at the <hi>Lords</hi> hands, as thou oughtest, I say to such a man (and marke it) it were better for him that he should want them: for certainely, when hee hath them, in this manner, he hath them without a blessing; yea he hath them with a curse, and so were better be without them; as it had been bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for <hi>Ab<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1 letter">

onely prevaile with him, not that the naturall are excluded (that is not my meaning) for they may adde vvindes to the sayles, though holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse may guide the rudder, and keepe the course, and make the sterage, yet naturall desires may make vs more importunate, and may adde much to it: therefore, I say, consider thy prayer.</p>
               <p>Consider againe, when thou hast sought so ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to <hi>God,</hi> whether it be not <hi>to bestow it vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thy lusts,</hi> as the Apostle speakes, <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 3. when thou hast a businesse to be performed, it may be, thou <note place="margin">Iam: 4. 3.

                  <note place="margin">1 Tim: 6. 9.</note>

anie affection exceedes, it ceaseth to bee an affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and begins to be a lust, and therfore where it is said, If any man will be rich &amp;c. it is said af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is a <hi>lust.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, you will say, how shall a man know, when he prayeth to bestow that, which he prayeth for, <note place="margin">Quest.</note> vpon his lusts?</p>
               <p>I answer, if a man consult with his owne heart, &amp; deale impartially with himselfe, he may know <note place="margin">Ans.</note> vvhat his ends are; but, if you cannot find it out, that way, you may know it by the effect, you may know it by the bills you bring in.

If a steward haue a <note place="margin">Simile.</note> great summe of mony, that his master hath tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted him vvith, and his bills be, that he hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed so much in riot, so much in fine apparrell, &amp;c, but there hath beene but so much bestowed for his masters advantage, it is an argument hee hath spent it ill: so, when we see, there hath been so much health spent, so much time, and so much strength, in following our owne plots, and our owne worldlie businesse, without respect to <hi>God,</hi> not serving <hi>God,</hi> and men in our calling, as vvee should doe, and that there hath beene little time bestowed in praier, in reading, in making our hearts perfect with <hi>God,</hi> in taking paines vvith them, from day to day, I say, if wee looke vpon this bill of expenc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:6314:29"/>
one price, that we haue in our hands, by vvhich we may doe good, it is as a bucket by which wee may draw from others, and likewise it is a spring, and fountaine, wherewith we may feede others, with the waters of life) consider, how wee haue laied out all these things, and by that wee may know, how we are disposed to vse the blessings, we seek for at <hi>Gods</hi> hands, whether we seek them to bestow them vpon our lusts, or to spend those gifts to our masters advantage; and, if we find we doe it for our owne lusts, in this case, I say to you go and amend your praiers, and God will amend your speeding. Wee must doe in this case, as an angler doth, when he hath throwne the bait into the river, if it stay long, and catch nothing, hee takes vp the baite, and amends it, and when hee <note place="margin">Simile.</note> sees it is well, he then continues, and waites: so we must doe in this case, if thou praie, and praie long, and haue not obtained the thing thou prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est for, looke diligentlie to thy praiers; see whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be right or no, if they bee not, amend thy praiers, and <hi>God</hi> will amend his readinesse to heare thee; if thou finde, they bee sincere and heartie, mingled with holie desires, and not with carnall, and corrupt affections, then, let the baite lie still, that is, continue to praie, and to vvaite, and the Lord vvill come in due time.</p>
               <p>But this is not all, though that bee one thing, <note place="margin">2 In respect of the manner, when they are vttered care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesly:</note> when thou art not heard, consider, if thou hast not praied amisse; it is a common fault amongst vs, when we succeede not in anie thing, we attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute

it to many other things, but not to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misnesse, and carelesnesse in seeking to <hi>God:</hi> if a man want sleepe, if he finde sicknesse, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and distemper of body, he thinkes that he hath eaten amisse, and considers not whether he hath prayed amisse; if a man haue miscarried in his businesse, he begins to thinke, whether hee haue not beene improvident, whether he hath not dealt foolishly; whether hee hath not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted such and such meanes, as hee might haue v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, hee neuer thinkes whether he haue prayed amisse; and that indeede, is the cause of our miscarrying, and not commonly the thing, which we attribute it vnto: for though <hi>God</hi> be not the immediat cause, you know hee is the great cause; <hi>There is no ill, that he hath notdone;</hi> and that which moues him is alway grace, and sinne; that which moues him to doe vs good, is our obedience to him, that which moues him on the contrary, is neglect on our part.</p>

It is all one, whether a man bee preserved from the blow of an enemie, or haue a helmet given <note place="margin">Simile.</note> him to keepe it off; it may be a man prayes for money, and for estate: if <hi>God</hi> provide meate and drinke, and cloathes immediately, in stead of this, is it not all one?

So that they thought they were further off now then ever they were before; but, in truth, they were nearer: for the increase of the bondage, increased <hi>Pharaohs</hi> sinne, and made him ripe for destruction: againe, it increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the peoples humility, it made them to pray harder, and to cry more servently to <hi>God</hi> for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, and so it made them more fit for it; and at the last, <hi>Moses</hi> was more fitted to be a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer, after hee was so long trained vp, and was so much humbled; so that when <hi>God</hi> seemes to goe a cleane contrary way, yet it is the next

               <p>Sometimes, for the tryall of our faith; as, wee see, he deferred to grant to the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Foure Reasons of Gods deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to grant our requests.</note> although he did meane to grant her request, yet he deferred long, that hee might put her to the triall; and, you see, shee was no looser by it, but when she held out in her prayers, she had her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest granted to the full.</p>
               <p>Sometimes, he deferres to grant it, that wee <note place="margin">2</note> may be more humbled: as you know, <hi>Paul</hi> prayed
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:6314:35"/>
earnestly, but <hi>God</hi> tolde him, that he would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre him, because he needed more humility: so he deferred to grant the request, that the men of <hi>Beniamin</hi> put vp to him, when the cause was iust, and <hi>God</hi> intended to helpe them, yet they fell be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their enemies twice, though they fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Againe, sometimes <hi>God</hi> deferrs, that we might <note place="margin">3</note> bee more able to vse those blessings that hee meanes to bestow vpon vs: so hee deferred to raise <hi>Ioseph</hi> to preferment: so he deferred to bring <hi>David</hi> to the Kingdome, that those afflictions that they indured might the better fit them to enioy so great prosperity, as he had provided for them afterwards.</p>
               <p>And lastly, he deferrs that he might set a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er <note place="margin">4</note> price vpon his blessings, that hee might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunce the price of them; as the fisher drawes <note place="margin">Simile.</note> away the bait, that the fish might follow it the more; so <hi>God</hi> withholds blessings, that we might haue a greater edge set vpon our desires, that we might pray harder for them, that we might prize them more, when wee haue obtained them.</p>
               <p>Now, as he doth thus for the time, and as we are often deceived in the time, in taking delayes for denialls; so likewise wee are often deceived <note place="margin">Concerning the measure, if God giue vs not so much as wee aske.</note> in the measure; many times God grants the things that wee would haue, but, because wee
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:6314:36"/>
haue not so large a measure as we expect; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we thinke we haue not it at all, and that the <hi>Lord</hi> hath denied vs our prayers, when indeede he hath not: for a lesser measure, many times, may serue as well as a greater; as God saith to <hi>Paul, my grace is sufficient for thee;</hi> though the temptation doe abide vpon vs, if there be suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient grace to keepe vs in a continuall conflict, and warre against it, if there be sufficient grace to obtaine pardon, to vphold, and to comfort vs in it, it is sufficient, it may bring vs to heaven, we haue a deliverance from it, even when wee seeme not to be delivered; though we haue not so full a victory, as we would haue, yet that grace may be sufficient.</p>
               <p>You shall see this almost in all the things we <note place="margin">A lesse measure may serue as well as a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Cleared in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. 1. Wealth. Psal: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

               <p>A little wealth may serue, as well as great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues: as in <hi>Psal.</hi> 38. 16. <hi>A little that the righteous hath is as much as great revenues to the wicked;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause a little, when God shall fill it with his bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings, it shall serue the turne as well; but, if a man hath great revenues, and God blowes vpon them, and leaues an emptinesse in them; if a man haue great revenues, if he haue great out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comforts, yet, if there be an emptinesse, if there be a vanity in them, if they be as the husk, without the graine, as the shell, without the ker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell, as they are often; though there be a great bulke, and they seeme very fit to comfort vs, yet

they will doe vs little good; whereas a little, on the other side, will doe much good: for in this case it is as it was with <hi>Manna, those that had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, yet they had sufficient, and those that gathered over, yet they had never a whit <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And so likewise, a little grace may be so vsed, <note place="margin">2.

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>: but this is a rule which is true, you will finde it true in all obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, <note place="margin">Note.</note> through the Scriptures, that, sometimes, those that haue great grace, yet they may fall into great sinnes, that they may be subiect
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:6314:37"/>
to some strong prevailing lust; as <hi>David,</hi> you know, had great grace, and yet, we see, hee was subiect to great sinnes together with it.</p>
               <p>And againe, a man may haue but a little grace, and yet that little grace may bee so ordered, and husbanded, and improved, that that little grace may keepe him from sinne, more then the other: this must bee warily vnderstood, not but that <note place="margin">Note in what sense this is to be taken.</note> great grace enables a man to doe greater workes, then the other; it enables a man, in the ordinary course, to resist greater temptations, more then lesse grace, but yet, (I say for our comfort, that) though a man haue but a little strength, yet, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> it is said there in the same place, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3. in that <note place="margin">Rev: 3.</note> little strength, <hi>I haue set a doore open to thee,</hi> it opened the doore of heaven wide enough, so that no man could shut it.</p>
               <p>And as we say for grace, so like wise for gifts, smaller gifts, meaner gifts may serue the turne, <note place="margin">3 Instance in gifts.</note> many times, as well as greater gifts: for, you know, a little finger, a small hand may serue to thread a needle, as well as a greater, and, it may <note place="margin">Simile.</note> be, will doe it better; for, in the Church there are varieties of operations, and variety of fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, and meaner gifts may serue for the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of some operations, of some services for the Church, as well as greater. And therefore, as there are variety of functions, so there are varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of members, some stronger, some weaker, and the weaker may serue, in some cases, as well as the stronger; a little barke may doe better in a small river, then a greater ship; so a man that <note place="margin">Simile.</note>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:6314:37"/>
hath but meane gifts may serue meane capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as well as greater, and better: and therefore thinke not that things are denied. when the thing is granted, not in such a measure. And lastly, to bee faithfull in a little gift will bring as great a reward, as to be faithfull in greater: <hi>thou hast beene faithfull in little,</hi> may <hi>make</hi> a man <hi>ruler over much,</hi> and may bring a great increase of the <hi>talents</hi> after. Therefore let not a man be discou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged, if he haue not so great a measure as others haue: so likewise if a man desire patience, and strength to goe through all variety of conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <note place="margin">4 Instance, in crosses, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions.</note> through all the troubles hee meetes with: sometimes the <hi>Lord</hi> layes a great burthen. vpon a mans shoulders, and giues him great strength to beare it; sometimes againe he giues but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <note place="margin">Simile.</note> strength, but then hee proportions the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then to it; and is it not all one, whether the burthen be great, and the strength answerable, or the burthen be lesse, and the strength little? sometimes he takes away calamity, sometimes he layes it vpon a man, and giues him as much strength as will beare it, and that is as good, as if it were removed; else, what is the meaning of that, <hi>you shall haue an hundred fold with persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> but that you shall haue so much ioy, and strength in persecution, that it shall be all one as if you wanted it? so we see <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. when <hi>Christ</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Heb: 5. 7.</note> prayed for deliverance, in that great houre of triall, the text saith, <hi>he was heard in the things hee feared,</hi> and yet, we see, the cup did not passe from him, because hee was strengthened to beare it,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:6314:38"/>
and so it is in this case; and so much shall serue for a full answere to that, that we be not mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in iudging our prayers not to be heard when they are heard.</p>
               <p>And now, Beloved, what remaines, but that we set out selues to the duty, to doe that we are exhorted vnto here, namely, to <hi>pray continually,</hi> that is, to pray very much, to keepe, at least, a <note place="margin">Dangers by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, or neglecting prayer.</note> constant course in it; for, if we doe neglect it, we doe but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

when they declined from that pitch, from that degree of faith, which they had obtained, you shall finde it commonly to arise from remisnesse in this duty: therefore we say to such, <hi>repent and amend, and doe your first workes;</hi> that is, vse your former diligence, renew that, and that will renew grace, and strength againe: therefore take <note place="margin">Benefit of fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency and diligence in prayer.

We haue great cause to be incouraged to it, for there is not a faithfull prayer that wee make shalbe lost, but they come vp into remembrance; and therefore you must consider with your selues, not onely what you doe for the present, but what stock of prayers you haue layed vp; you know a man may haue much, in bils, and bonds, as well as in present money; so there is a certaine <note place="margin">Simile.</note> stocke of prayer, a certaine treasure layed vp, that shall not be forgotten. The husbandman lookes not onely vpon the graine that hee hath in his <note place="margin">Simile.</note> garner, but he lookes vpon that which is sowne, though it be out of his hands, yea he reckons that the better of the two; so those prayers that haue beene sowed, it may be, many yeares agoe, are such as will bring in a sure increase: therefore let vs be exhorted to be constant in this duty, to be frequent therein, to <hi>continue in it, watching thereto with perseverance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now we haue dispatched this, wee will come to answere some cases of conscience that fall out in the performance of this duty, which are divers.</p>
               <p>First, this is one; what shall a man iudge of <note place="margin">Case 1</note>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:6314:39"/>
his prayers, when they are accompanied with <note place="margin">About wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring thoughts in prayer.</note> wandring thoughts, whether those prayers are such as <hi>God</hi> wholly refuseth, or what he is to doe in such a case, when he is subiect to wandring thoughts, to vanity of minde, and distemper in the performance of that duty?</p>
               <p>To this I answere, that wee must distinguish <note place="margin">Ans.</note> of the cause whence these wandring thoughts a rise.</p>
               <p>Sometimetimes they arise, not so much from our owne neglect, as from weaknesse, from temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: <note place="margin">1 The cause of them is weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note> and in such a case, <hi>God</hi> layes them not so much to our charge: as, for example, one that aymes at a marke, and doth his best to hit the <note place="margin">Simile.</note> marke, yet, if hee hath a hand, or an arme, that hath the palsey in it, or if one iogg him while he is about it, the fault was not so much in him, it was not want of good will to doe it, nor want of diligence; but, either it is his weaknesse, or it is an impediment cast in by another: so it is in this case, this wandring of minde proceeds from a naturall infirmity, and imbecillity that hangs vpon the nature of man, which is not so able to keepe it selfe close to such a spirituall businesse; and thy <hi>God</hi> considers: for he is wise, and <hi>kno<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> to doe it.</p>
               <p>But the other case is, when he is iogged in his <note place="margin">2. Temptation.</note> shooting by another, that is, when <hi>Sathan</hi> inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts him, when he is diligent to hinder him in such a dutie; in this case, <hi>God</hi> chargeth it not vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, and doth not cast vs off, nor reiect our pray ers, because of that: but, on the other side, when this wandring of minde shall rise from meere negligence, on our part, from profanesse, from <note place="margin">3. Negligence</note> want of reverence, because we doe not intend holy duties as we ought, we come not to them with that conscionablenesse, with that careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse as we should doe; in this case now, it is a great sinne, this moues the <hi>Lord</hi> to anger, when we performe the duty in that manner, when we doe not so much as set our selues about it with our strength, but suffer our mindes to wander without any resistance.</p>
               <p>Or secondly, when we our selues be the cause <note place="margin">4. Voluntary admitting vaine thoughts</note> of it by admitting of loose thoughts, by suffering our selues to be worldly minded, by suffering an indisposition to grow vpon vs, and not labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to resist it, and cast it off againe. You know, when an instrument is out of tune, if the lesson <note place="margin">Simile.</note> be never so good, that is played vpon it, yet it is vnpleasant because the instrument is out of tune; and whose fault is that? so, when thou com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mest to <hi>God,</hi> and sufferest thy heart to be distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered before and doest not looke to keepe it in order; that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

When a <note place="margin">Simile.</note> man is to vse his horse, he doth not suffer him to runne vp and downe in the pastures wildly, but will haue him vnder bridle; so we should keepe our hearts in frame, that they may be ready to doe vs service in such a holy dutie, when wee haue neede of them.</p>
               <p>Secondly, we must be diligent, when we come to performe the duty, that, though our mindes doe wander, yet we may be ready to recall them presently, to set our selues to it with all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: so much for answering of this first case.</p>
               <p>The second case is, what a man is to doe, when hee findes a great indisposition to prayer, <note place="margin">

               <p>To this I answere briefly, that in all such cases, <note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> a man is bound notwithstanding to performe it, let his heart bee never so much out of temper, let there be never so great a dulnesse, and dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of spirit vpon him, yet hee is bound to doe it.</p>

               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:6314:40"/>
I answere, that a man by setting himselfe vpon the worke, shall gather a fitnesse, though he were <note place="margin">Answ.</note> vnfit at the first: you know, members, that are <note place="margin">Simile.</note> benummed, yet by vsing them, they get life, and heate, and come, in the end, to bee nimble e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough; so it is with the heart, in this case, when it is benummed, the very vsing of it makes it fit for the duty: You know, wood, though it bee <note place="margin">Simile.</note> greene, yet, if it be long blowed, at the length, it will be dry, and take fire; so it is with the heart, a man may be long about getting it on the wing, yet, with much adoe, he may doe it, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ought to doe this duty in such a case; yea, so much the rather, because there is never more neede of calling vpon <hi>God,</hi> then at such a time: for then a man lyes most exposed to temptation, then, if any sinne come, he is ready to bee over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken with it, he is vnfit for any thing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <note place="margin">Note.</note> if ever he haue neede to call vpon <hi>God</hi> it is at that time.</p>
               <p>But you will say, it may be, <hi>God</hi> will not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it? <note place="margin">Obiect.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I answere briefly, if a mans heart be so indispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, <note place="margin">Answ. 2.</note> that, when he hath done all he can, yet hee can get no life, hee can get no heate in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of such a duty, yet <hi>God</hi> may accept that prayer, as well as that which is most servent: And that you may vnderstand this aright, you must take it with this distinction:</p>
               <p>This dulnesse, and deadnesse in prayer, it comes from one of these two causes. <note place="margin">Causes of dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse.</note>
               </p>
               <p>One is, when <hi>God</hi> withdrawes his owne spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <note place="margin">1. Desertion.</note>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:6314:41"/>
that is, withdrawes not his spirit altogether; <note place="margin">2. When there is some neglect on our part.</note> (for there may be a helpe, when we perceiue it not), but when hee withdrawes the liuelinesse, and quicknesse of his spirit, and in this case, if wee doe our dutie, if wee doe the best wee can, the <hi>Lord</hi> doth accept it, though hee hath not vouchsafed such inlargement of our hearts, though hee haue not powred out his spirit vpon vs, in the performance of the dutie, as at other times, but he giues a secret helpe, that perhaps we feele not, nor perhaps is so great as at other times; yet I say, when it ariseth from his owne withdrawing of that fitnesse, &amp; we are not neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, but we doe our best, in this case, <hi>God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts the will for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>,</hi> as wee haue often said to you: that rule alway holds good, when the impediment is such as we cannot remoue, when the dulnesse of spirit is such as it is not in our power to remoue, when wee haue vsed our vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most diligence, in that case it is no hindrance: and therefore it is a great comfort vnto vs, that we haue vsed our diligence in this duty, when we haue vsed our best to quicken our hearts, though it be not done, yet <hi>God</hi> accepts our prayers, as well as if they were performed in a more liuely and fervent manner.</p>
               <p>The next case is what a man is to doe after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he hath committed some great sinne, after he hath <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Case.</hi> 3. About praying after a man hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted some gross<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap> sinne.</note> wounded his conscience, whether then, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, he must come, &amp; keep his consta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t course in prayer, morning, &amp; evening, whether he shall be so bold, as to come into <hi>Gods</hi> presence afte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> he hath so exceedingly offended him.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:6314:41"/>
To this I answere, that a man is bound, (not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> In this case prayer is not to be neglected.</note> any sinne that he hath committed, be it what it will be) to keepe his course con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly in prayer, and not to omit it, not to keepe off, not to deferre it. And my ground for it is, because this is a duty, it is a charge that <hi>God</hi> hath layed vpon all, to <hi>pray continually;</hi> that is, at the least twice a day, as we shewed before, to keepe a constant course in it: now, it is certaine, our failing in one thing, must not excuse vs in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <note place="margin">Note.</note> When the dute lyes on vs, wee haue no dispensation to be negligent in it; and therefore we are bound to doe it.</p>
               <p>Againe, consider this, that a particular offence doth not offend so much, as if we grow strangers <note place="margin">2. Reas.</note> to <hi>God:</hi> as if we grow to a generall rebellion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. As, put the case, a childe commits a great offence against his father, yet, if hee runne <note place="margin">Simile.</note> away from his fathers house, and grow a stranger to him, that is more then the particular offence: for a generall rebellion must needs be more then the particular, and to giue over calling vpon <hi>God,</hi> to breake off that course, to grow a stranger to him, to runne away from his house, and (as it were) to be ready to giue over all his ordinances, &amp; a constant course of obedience to him, this is a generall rebellion, &amp; is worse then the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; yea such carriage, after sin committed, moues <hi>God</hi> to anger more then the sin it selfe; as, many times, the contemptuous, negligent, rebellious carriage, after an offence, moues a mast<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>r, a hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, or a parent more, then the particular failing though it were exceeding great.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:6314:42"/>
Besides, consider, when a man commits a great finne, he makes a great gap in his conscience, he <note place="margin">Reas. 3.</note> makes a great breach there, and will you haue that breach lye open? is not that very dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous? is not that the way to bring in more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>in, and to suffer those good things that are in the heart to steale out? I will giue you but one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance for this: You see, St. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he had committed a great sinne, in denying his master, and forswearing of him too, yet, because he came in presently, and repented, and sought pardon, (as you know hee did) you see, hee was preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from running into further arrerages: for hee made vp the gappe, hee made vp the breach.</p>
               <p>We see, on the other side, when <hi>David</hi> had committed that sinne with <hi>Batb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>But may I not stay till I bee more fitted, till my heart bee more softened, and more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled? <note place="margin">Quest.</note>

                  <pb n="79" facs="tcp:6314:42"/>
the heart commonly growes more hard in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance; the conscience is more tender, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the sinne is committed, then it is afterwards; and when thou stayest for more hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, thou findest lesse; and therefore, while the wound is greene, and when the fire hath ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken newly holde, it is then best to quench it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wound be festered, before it hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued long; for the heart will grow worse, and worse, as it is <hi>Heb:</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Take heede that you be not hardened through the deceitfulnesse of sinne;</hi> the <note place="margin">Heb: 3 12.</note> meaning is this, when thou committest a sinne, you thinke, if you stay a weeke, or a fortnight, or a moneth, you shall come in as well as at the first; no, saith the Apostle, <hi>while it is to day,</hi> come in, that is, doe it presently, for sinne will deceiue you, it will harden your heart before you bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, it will make a distance betweene <hi>God,</hi> and you, it will take you off from him, it will leade you further on; and therefore take heede, that your hearts bee not hardened through the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulnesse of sinne, that sinne doe not deceiue you, and it will doe it before you thinke of it: and therefore in this case you should doe as you <note place="margin">Simile.</note> doe with waters, when waters breake out a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, it is best to stop them presently; if you suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them, they will make the breach greater, till at length, you be vnable to stop them; so in this case, when you have committed a great sin, come in speedily.</p>
               <p>But you will say, what shall a man come into <hi>Gods</hi> presence, who is most holy, after he hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed <note place="margin">Obiect.</note>

himselfe with some great sinne, is not this an vnreuerent thing?</p>
               <p>I answer briefly, it is very true, if thou be bolde <note place="margin">Answ.</note> to come into <hi>Gods</hi> presence with the same d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>unesse: and therefore, when we say, thou must come in, and keepe a constant course in prayer notwithstanding, the meaning is, you must come in with a disposition turned aside from your sinnes, and brought home to <hi>God,</hi> with a minde to abhorre that which is evill, and to cleaue to that which is good; there must bee this conversation of the minde to him, thou must not come in with the same disposition, that must be altered.

had set formes they vsed, and I know no obie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction against it of weight. One maine obiection is this:</p>
               <p>That in stinted prayer the spirit is streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> when a man is tyed to a forme, then he shall haue his spirit, as it were, bounden, and limited, that he cannot goe beyond that, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed; and therefore, say they, it is reason a man should be left to more libertie, (as he is in conceived prayers) and not tyed to a strict forme?</p>
               <p>To this I answere, even those men, that are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <note place="margin">Answ. 1.</note> this, and that vse this reason, they doe the same thing daily in the congregation: for when another prayes, that is a set forme to him, that heares it, I say, it is a forme to him: for put that case, that he that is a hearer, that heares a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother pray, suppose that his spirit bee more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, it is a straightning to him, hee hath no li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie to goe out: he is bound to keepe his minde intent vpon it; and therefore, if that were a suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient reason, that a man might not vse a set forme, because the spirit is streightned, a man should not heare another pray, (though it be a conceived prayer) because, in that case, his spirit is limited, it may be, the hearer hath a lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger heart, a great deale, then he that speakes and prayes; so that there is a bounding, and streight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and a limiting of the spirit. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that reason cannot be good.</p>

                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> no tye, and limit vpon that. And this is enough to satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie that, that a set for me of prayer must be vsed.</p>
               <p>But now, if you aske; whether that be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent? whether a man may thinke, if hee haue <note place="margin">Quest.</note> beene present at publique prayer, (which is a commendable thing to vse it constantly) I say, whether that be sufficient?</p>
               <p>My Beloved, this is a matter of some moment, to consider what we ought to doe in this case; <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Publick prayer not sufficient.</note> for we may be deceived in it, and I answer plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, it is not sufficient: a man that i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> diligent in publique prayers, that keeps them morning and evening; if he thinkes now hee hath discharged his duty, he is in a very great error: and this is the reason, because they are not sufficient. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, they are to be vsed; for <hi>God</hi> is worshipped in them, and it is a more publ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>que worship; and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:6314:44"/>
when <hi>God</hi> is honoured before many, as a man, <note place="margin">Simile.</note> when there are many spectators, more honour is done to him, it is a greater honour; so it is when men ioyne in this worship. And many other reasons there be, but that is not the thing, I am now vpon, to commend it to you; but, I say, it is not sufficient, although it ought to bee done, <note place="margin">1. Reas.</note> because there are many particular sinnes, which cannot be confessed in publique prayer, there are many particular wants, which in publique pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er you cannot vnfold, and open, and expresse vnto the <hi>Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Againe, the end of a set forme of prayer is to be a helpe for the private, (for the publique it is <note place="margin">2. Reas.</note> another case) a helpe that one may vse that is yet exceeding weake: a childe, that cannot goe, may haue such a proppe, but we must not alway bee children, we must not alway vse that helpe.</p>
               <p>Besides, we must consider this, that there is no man, that hath any worke of grace in his heart, <note place="margin">3. Reas.</note> but he is inabled in some measure to pray, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a set forme of prayer, hee is able to expresse his desires to <hi>God</hi> in private, one way, or another: there was never any man, in any extreame want, but he knew how to expresse himselfe, where he had libertie to speake: so it is in this case.</p>
               <p>Besides, the spirit of a man hath greater li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie in private; there a man may <hi>powre forth</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">4. Reas.</note>

                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:6314:45"/>
Besides, there is a particular paines that a man is to take with his heart, from day to day, which, <note place="margin">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>, and worldly mindednesse, the end of this duty is to worke them out againe, to renew repentance againe; and, when there is a forgetfulnesse of the covenant, when grace growes weake, when good desires begin to languish, to renew, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them, to put fewell to them: and this is not done by the performance of the publ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>I answer this briefly, (for there is no great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in these things, and therefore I p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>sse them <note place="margin">Ans.</note> over) for the gesture in publike, there is more heede to be taken of that; because it is a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like and open worship of <hi>God;</hi> and therefore in publike the g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ture is alway to be reverent. You know how often it is repeated, (in the olde te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:6314:45"/>
especially) that they <hi>bowed downe, and worshipped</hi> still, <hi>Christ</hi> looked vp to heaven, <hi>Paul kneeled downe,</hi> and the rest with him, and prayed; and many such like expressions you haue men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Scriptures: where you haue prayer mentioned in publike, still you shall finde an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression of some reverend gesture, and when we appeare before the <hi>Lord</hi> in the publike perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of this dutie, especiall care must bee taken hereunto in the private, the case is different; there variety of gestures may be vsed. I doe not see, but all variety of gestures may be vsed; there are many examples for <hi>walking,</hi> and <hi>lying,</hi> and <hi>sitting;</hi> onely this is to be taken heede to, that, even in private, as farre as may be, the gesture be such, as may both expresse the inward reverence in the heart, and of the outward man; but there i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap> a libertie in that: I thinke this is the best rule in private, that the gesture bee vsed, that doth <note place="margin">Note.</note> most quicken, and doth helpe the duty most. Some gesture may bring a dulnesse, and in dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, when another may quicken the body, and make it more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>it for prayer: sometimes lying is inconvenient, and sometimes more convenient; and therefore, in this case, the best rule is, to vse that ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ure, which quickens most, which helpes most the duty: some gesture may breede a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinesse in the body, some may breede a dulnesse, some are painfull to the body, all this is a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to the duty, when the change of it may quicken and helpe.</p>
               <p>Now for the voice, I say, for that (as for the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:6314:46"/>
sture) it is not simply required: for <hi>God is a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and he will be worshipped in spirit:</hi> men, that <note place="margin">Iohn 4. 24.</note> haue eares, and bodies, they must haue men speak to them, but <hi>God,</hi> that is a spirit, delights in that, which is like himselfe; and therefore all his eye is vpon the inward behaviour of the spirit. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, the spirit may speake to <hi>God,</hi> when the voice doth not; as, you know, the <hi>Angels</hi> speake to <hi>God,</hi> and they speake one to another. The Schoolemen haue great disputes about the speech of <hi>Angels,</hi> but this they agree in, that one <hi>Angel</hi> speakes to another after this manner; when any one hath a conceit, in his minde, of any thing, with a will that another should vnderstand it, and that <hi>God</hi> should vnderstand it, that is enough for the expression of it; so it is with the spirit of a man, when he hath such a petition in his heart, in his minde, and there is a desire in his will, that <hi>God</hi> should vnderstand that petition; that is an offering it vp to the <hi>Lord,</hi> it is as true a speaking to the <hi>Lord,</hi> as when you deliver it by an outward voice: for the spirit agrees with the Angels; as it is a speech, and as they speake one to another, and to the <hi>Lord;</hi> so doth the spirit of man; though, indeede, the tongue be to be vsed, as it is <hi>Iam.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>there with blesse <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> God;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with should we pray among others, and before others; and speake before others: but when there is any cause to vse the voice, in private, it is this, as farre as it may quicken the heart, (as I said of gesture) and as farre as thereby wee may keepe our thoughts from wandring. If the voice
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:6314:46"/>
were not vsed, perhaps, thoughts would be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to more wandring, and we should not be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to take notice of them; but they would slip before we are aware; &amp; therfore, when the voice is vsed, it must be to keepe in the thoughts. In some cases, to omit the voice, is more convenient when it may draw any other inconvenience, but that is left to every mans particular case; as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

a time, but <hi>God,</hi> in mercie, and in wisedome, hath left it to our liberty: onely, you see, this is the command, <hi>Pray continually,</hi> doe it exceeding much, at the least, keepe a constant course in it, as wee heard before, but you may bee shorter in it.</p>
               <p>Now let these foure Cautions be observed.</p>
               <p>First, take heede that this straightning come <note place="margin">Cautions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout shortnes of prayer in such straits.</note> not from your ill husbandry, that is, from your ill husbanding of time; For, if a man were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to redeeme time before, it may be, he neede <note place="margin">1 Caution.</note> not be put to such a strait, as he is at that time, when he is to performe this duty: suppose you haue a iourney to goe, that requires so much time, and you must be gone early, you may so husband the time before, that you may get time for your iourney. And for the performance of this duty, and so for other businesse, as I said in the morning, when you should sequester your selues to performe this duty of prayer, take heed that you be good steward of your time, that you husband it well.</p>
               <p>And likewise, this is another part of husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding your time, that you let not that, which is very pretious, goe for things of small moment, for that is ill husbandry. You should redeeme the time, and buy it with the losse of something. You haue time to bestow in the waighty busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of your calling, in things that belong to the good of man, much more should you in this that belongs to the worship of <hi>God:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if it may be, redeeme it with some losse; so

you ought to husband it, otherwise you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme not time as you ought. This is the first Caution that ought to be observed, to husband and redeeme the time well.</p>
               <p>The second is, if we bee straitned at any time, <note place="margin">2 Caution.</note> recompence it an another time: for if it be not a feigned excuse and pretence, if you be straitned, when you haue libertie, you will bee carefull to spend mo<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e time in it; by that you shall know your sinceritie in it, that it is true, and that it is not an excuse, and a putting off.</p>
               <p>Moreover, another Caution to be observed is, that you take not too much businesse vpon you: <note place="margin">3 Caution.</note> if you be straitned with businesse, and therefore cannot be so large in the performance of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as otherwise you would, if you take not too much vpon you, your selues are the cause of it: And therefore, he that takes lesse, he that spends more time in the things that belong to salvation, he hath made the better choise; As <hi>Mary</hi> made a better choise then <hi>Martha,</hi> though her imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were good.</p>
               <p>Likewise, as you must not pester your selues with too much businesse, so likewise you must <note place="margin">4 Caution.</note> take care, that your mindes be not too much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent vpon them; for too much intention of mind vpon businesse, causeth distraction in prayer, and causeth vs post over over the dutie, as well as too much businesse: when a mans minde shootes it selfe too farre in businesse, when it is too much occupied about it, when it is too much intent, when the soule cleaues too fast vpon the busines,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:6314:49"/>
and cannot loose it selfe to the performance of spirituall duties, which require freedome.</p>
               <p>The last Caution is, that the strait rise not <note place="margin">5 Caution.</note> from diffidence in <hi>God,</hi> and confidence in the vse of the meanes; for, it falls out oft times when wee haue businesse of moment in hand, there is a turning, and posting from one crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to another, from the vse of one meanes to another, that we cannot get time in prayer, not so much for want of time simply, but because we minde the meanes too much, we intend them too much, we doe not trust <hi>God</hi> enough with the businesse, if wee did, wee might spend lesse time in them, and more in seeking to him. So much for that case.</p>
               <p>Another case of Conscience in this businesse of calling vpon <hi>God</hi> is, what a man is to doe <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Case</hi> 7 About vse of the meanes.</note> for the vse of the meanes, for when we are bid to pray and seeke to <hi>God,</hi> that is the ordinarie question; But may wee not vse the meanes too?</p>
               <p>To this I answere, That prayer is so farre from excluding the meanes, that it includes <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Answ.</hi> Reasons why meanes must be vsed.</note> them; for, if the desire be servent, when we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire any things at <hi>Gods</hi> hands, it will make vs dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the vse of the meanes, to vse a convenient <note place="margin">1</note> diligence; as it will make you earnest in seeking to <hi>God,</hi> and in putting vp your requests to him: for, if a man shall pray, and bee negligent in the vse of the meanes, I will be bolde to say it, it is but like the desire of the sluggard, that is a languishing, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>ting desire: He desires, but
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:6314:49"/>
his soule hath nothing; hee desires, but hee putts his hand into his bosome; The desires, which you expresse, when you pray, they are not servent, they are not earnest, if you bee remisse in the vse of the meanes. Hee that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires grace, desires strength, against sinfull lusts, and temptations, and yet is remisse in the vse of the meanes, by which grace should be increased, and strength gained, to resist those corruptions, and temptations; Certainly those desires are but vaine desires.</p>
               <p>Besides, it is an an argument that wee trust <note place="margin">2. Reas.</note> not in <hi>God,</hi> That wee make not accompt of our prayers, except wee bee diligent in the vse of the meanes; therefore wee are farre from excluding them: for, if you seeke to <hi>God,</hi> and trust to your prayers, and thinke that they will prevaile with him, it will worke this effect, That you will bee carefull to vse such meanes, as <hi>God</hi> hath ordeined to bring the thing to passe. Even as, if a man seeke to a Phisitian, to such a Phisitian, that hee trust<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <note place="margin">Simile.</note> to, into whose hands hee would put his life; When this Phisitian prescribes such a course, such a dyet, and such a thing to bee taken at such a time, the more hee rests vpon the Phisitian, the more carefull hee will bee to obserue his prescription, and rules: And so, in this case, the more you rest on <hi>God,</hi> the more carefull you will be to vse such meanes, as hee hath appointed, when hee hath said, these, and these meanes are to bee vsed. In this
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:6314:50"/>
case, I say, it is a signe your prayers are more to purpose, when you are diligent in the vse of them, when you dare not sleight nor neglect them.</p>
               <p>Againe, you must consider this, that, when we pray, at anie time, wee doe not pray to haue <note place="margin">3. Reas.</note> any thing done without meanes, but we pray to haue a blessing vpon the meanes, but we pray, to haue a blessing vpon the meanes, and, if we pray for a blessing vpon the meanes, our minde is not that they should bee omitted; for, you see, <hi>God</hi> doth all things by second causes, he saues us not without our selues, that is, he vseth vs as instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, he doth everie thing by men, and by crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and by meanes, and the end of our praiers is, not to haue them done without meanes, but to haue a blessing vpon them. But that that is chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flie to be observed to cleare this point to you is this; That praier is not the onelie meanes, it is but part of the meanes to bring anie things to passe.</p>
               <p>There are two things to effect a businesse, that <note place="margin">4. Reas.</note> is, praier and meanes both: we doe not say praier is the onelie meanes; indeed, then the other were excluded, but since it is but a part, and the other makes vp the totall meanes of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any thing to passe, it doth not exclude them, but they may bee both ioyned together, praier, and the vse of the meanes. This is enough to shew that we may vse means, we may pray, &amp; lay our hand on the plowe, wee maie seeke to <hi>God,</hi> and bee diligent, and as diligent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 words">

else; But now these three Cautions are to bee <note place="margin">Cautions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the vse of meanes</note> observed..</p>
               <p>The first is, That, if wee doe vse meanes, wee vse those that are right; for, if you trust <hi>God,</hi> and <note place="margin">1 Caution.</note> depend vpon him, you will not step out to anie inordinate meanes, nor vse lawfull meanes in an inordinate manner: If you doe so, it is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment your praiers are of no value in your owne esteeme, you doe not rest on <hi>God;</hi> for, if you did, you would not vse other meanes, then hee hath appointed.</p>
               <p>Secondly, though you vse the meanes, and <note place="margin">2 Caution.</note> pray both, yet you must so vse the meanes, that your confidence be in your praiers: for it is one thing to vse the meanes, and it is another thing to haue confidence in them. And therefore wee say to you in this case, that you must doe as hee <note place="margin">Simile.</note> that vseth the light of the Sunne; he so vseth the light, that he hath an eye vpon the Sunne from whom that light co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>nes; for, he knowes, that if the Sunne were set, the light would be gone. Or as he that takes water in a Cesterne, or River, he <note place="margin">Simile.</note> so takes it, as that he hath an eye to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, he knowes if the fountaine were stopped, the River would bee quickly dried vp: So you should thinke with your selues, if I use any meanes, any creature, any instrument to bring things to passe, mine eye must be vpon <hi>God:</hi> for all the helpe that we haue from the creature, it is but as a beame to the helpe that comes from <hi>God</hi> himselfe. And therefore you must doe, in this case, as Phisitians are wont to doe, they put ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <note place="margin">Simile.</note>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:6314:51"/>
ingredients into a thing, but it is one princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall ingredient, amongst the rest, that hee makes account will cure the disease: So doe, in this case, make vse, both of the prayer, and of the meanes, yet you must know, that prayer is the principall effecter of the thing, and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall meanes, it is that, wherein your confidence is to bee: for, indeede, it is <hi>God</hi> that doth bring every thing to passe: There is no good in the Citty, nor no evill, but he doth it; you know he takes all to himselfe. All the meanes, by which Good, and Ill is conveyed to you, they doe not doe the thing, they are but the <hi>v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>ls,</hi> they are but the Instruments, as the beere, and the wine, wherein the ph<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>sicke is taken, but it <note place="margin">Simile.</note> is the phisicke, the medicine that cures: So all the meanes cannot doe it, it is the helpe, and the power of <hi>God,</hi> the efficacie, that comes from him, that brings things to passe; therefore, that must bee remembred, vse the meanes, that you vse, with dependance vpon <hi>God,</hi> with an eye vpon him, that your hearts rest not vpon them: for, if they doe, it is an inordinate vse of them.</p>
               <p>Lastly, you must take heede of sticking in any particular meanes; for, if you doe, it is a signe <note place="margin">3 Caution.</note> trust not <hi>God,</hi> as you ought to doe. It is a fault commonly, we pitch vpon such a particular way, and we thinke that must doe it, or nothing: Now, if <hi>God</hi> be trusted to, hee hath more wayes to the wood then one, he hath more meanes to bring a thing to passe then one: And therefore we must leaue it to him, who often doth it best by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:6314:51"/>
meanes, then we dreamed of. As for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>David</hi> had a promise of the Kingdome; Now, when he had the Kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> yet you know, the Kingdome of <hi>Israel</hi> stood out: for <hi>Ishbosheth</hi> had the Kingdome, and <hi>Abner</hi> was his chiefe Captaine: besides, in his comming into his Kingdome of <hi>Iudah,</hi> we see how <hi>God</hi> wrought the businesse, without device, by a meanes, that he never thought of, in that battaile, when <hi>Saul</hi> was killed, and so many of his sonnes, there was so much way made for him, when himselfe vsed no meanes to bring it to passe. Afterward when the Kingdome of <hi>Israel</hi> was kept from him, and he had onely <hi>Iudah,</hi> we see, <hi>God</hi> caused a division between <hi>Ishbosheth,</hi> and <hi>Abner</hi> his chiefe Captain; vpon that comes <hi>Abner,</hi> and offers to <hi>David</hi> the whole Kingdome, but yet he was but a reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led enemie; and what <hi>Abner</hi> might haue done, he knew not. Therefore, <hi>God</hi> by his providence, though <hi>Ioab</hi> sinned in it, caused <hi>Abner</hi> to bee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by <hi>Ioab;</hi> when this was done, yet <hi>Ish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bosheth</hi> was aliue still; then were there two men set by the providence of <hi>God,</hi> (though it were a great sinne in them) to take away his head, and so the Kingdome came wholly to <hi>David:</hi> for, there were but two sonnes, <hi>Mephibosheth,</hi> that was lame of his seete, and <hi>Ishbosheth,</hi> that was lame in his minde, a weake man vnable to mannage so great, and weighty a businesse, to purpose: So <hi>God</hi> brought the businesse to passe by a way, that <hi>David</hi> thought not off. Therefore, though wee may vse means, yet, after the vse of them, wee
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:6314:52"/>
must depend vpon <hi>God,</hi> and leaue it to <hi>God</hi> to take one meanes, or other. We must doe, in this case, as we doe when wee goe to a man, that is very <note place="margin">Simile.</note> skilfull to doe a worke for vs: If we goe to a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, and tell him we haue such a thing to bee done; or, if we goe to those that we call <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Why will you not trust <hi>God,</hi> that goes so much beyond vs, that hath an infinite wisedome, and an infinite po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer? And therefore we should so vse the meanes, that withall we keep our dependance vpon him, that we leaue it to him to vse this, or that meanes, as it pleaseth him. For sometimes, it may be, he ta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>s away that which we are about, sometimes he leaues vs partly destitute, and findes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>Another Case is, what it is to pray in faith? You know that is required. Now there is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Case</hi> 8 About praying in faith, when a man wants a particular pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, that the thing which he asketh shall be granted.</note> errour in this point: for a man may say, if I pray for the salvation of another, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

nesse, from such a calamity, that he lyes vnder, he findes no particular promise, and, for ought he knowes, it shall never be granted: How can hee bee said to pray in faith? for to pray in faith, is to beleeue, that the thing shall bee done.</p>
               <p>I answere, that to pray in faith is to goe as farre as the promise goes. Now no particular <note place="margin">Answ.</note> man hath any particular promise, that hee shall haue such a deliverance, that he shall haue such a particular mercie granted him; and therefore it is not required to belieue that particular thing should be done.</p>
               <p>But you will say; what faith is it then that is <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Obiect.</hi> What faith is, required</note> required?</p>
               <p>I say, it is enough to beleeue that <hi>God</hi> is a father, that hee is readie to heare, and not <note place="margin">Ans.</note> onely that hee is readie to heare, but that hee is readie to doe that which is best for mee, in such a particular: for both are required, that you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him to bee well affected towards you, as a father, as one that tenders your good, and not onely so, but that hee will doe that, in that particular, that shall bee most for his owne glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and for your good: and, if you doe so, you pray in faith; though, for the particular, you know not, whether it shall be granted, or no. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if we had a particular promise, as <hi>Elias</hi> had that it should not raine, &amp;c. in that case, we were bound to beleeue in particular, but not having that, wee are not tyed vnto it: for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise is the obiect of faith, and the habit is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:6314:53"/>
not to worke beyond the obiect; for the obiect is the rule, and the limit of the habit; therefore you may pray in faith, when yet you haue no ground to belieue, and to thinke, that that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular thing should be granted. For example, if a father pray, that his sonne may haue grace wrought in his heart, that his soule may be saved, it may be the <hi>Lord</hi> will never doe it; or, if one friend pray for another to the same purpose, though the thing be not done, yet the prayer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnes into his bosome, hee is no looser by it, there is a reward belongs to him, for seeking to <hi>God</hi> in sinceritie, it is his duty, that he should doe so. The like I may say for every particular case. And this incouragement you may haue, that there is never any particular prayer put vp, wherein you seeke things, that are not granted, but you mistake in it: for, if you believe thus farre, as I said to you, be sure, that your prayers are accepted, <hi>God</hi> will doe that, which is best for you, and your prayers shall not be lost. So much also for that.</p>

               <p>In that case, a man may bee very earnest, and yet hee cannot build vpon it, to say, my heart is much inlarged in prayer, and therefore I shall be heard; but take in this, when the heart is inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with holy desires, and that in a speciall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, somewhat more then ordinary, as that, you see, it is the worke of the spirit of <hi>God,</hi> quickning your heart, opening it wide, strengthening, and

The like wee may say of every particular case: we must bee carefull to cleanse our selues from all sinfull lusts, and corrupt affections, that they haue not dominion in our hearts; but that we lift vp pure hearts, and innocent hands, and that is the first thing that is required; that the person bee right, that is, not onelie that hee bee within the Covenant, but likewise that those par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular sinnes be removed, that may be an impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment to his prayers.</p>
               <p>The second thing required is faith; <hi>List vp</hi>

Now the <hi>Lord</hi> requires faith; partly, for his <note place="margin">Why the Lord requireth faith in prayer.</note> owne sake, he would not otherwise be acknow ledged, if you did not trust him, when you come to seeke him, if you did not rest vpon him.

                  <note place="margin">Atwofold faith required in our prayers.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The one is a faith in the providence of <hi>God,</hi> the other is a faith in his promise.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="107" facs="tcp:6314:56"/>
First, I say, faith in the providence, which is a thing of much moment, and we are apt to forget it. We see it cleerely, <hi>Psal.</hi> 146. <hi>Blessed is hee that trusts in the God of Iacob, &amp;c. who made heaven, and</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Psal: 146. 5. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>earth, and the sea, who keepes Covenant, and mercie for ever;</hi> you see faith there required in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, <hi>he made heaven and earth, and the Sea,</hi> is he such a <hi>God,</hi> who is able to bring any thing to passe; for he made heaven, and earth; and is he not able to doe any thing besides?</p>
               <p>Secondly, there must be a faith in the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, as is expressed in the other words, <hi>hee keepeth Covenant for ever.</hi> So likewise, to expresse the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it: You see when <hi>Martha,</hi> and <hi>Marie</hi> came to <hi>Christ</hi> to raise <hi>Lazirus,</hi> they believed hee was readie enough to doe it, (there was faith in his willingnesse) but they wanted faith in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: for <hi>Martha</hi> comes to him, &amp; tels him, <hi>Lord</hi> saith she, <hi>he hath beene in the graue foure dayes;</hi> as if she had said, surely now it cannot be done, if thou hadst come sooner, it might haue beene brought to passe; so she beleeved him to be willing, but there wanted faith in the providence.</p>
               <p>Againe, as here faith in the providence was wanting, so, we see, in the leper, there was faith in the providence, (it may be, the other was wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, but that is not expressed, it is more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble he had both) <hi>Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me whole.</hi> Here was an evidence of faith in the providence, he acknowledgeth his power, <hi>if thou wilt, thou caust make mee whole;</hi> but because <hi>Christ</hi> did answere him, it is likely hee had
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:6314:57"/>
faith in the promise too; So, I say, there must be a faith, first, in the providence; secondly, there must be a faith also in the promise of <hi>God:</hi> you haue ground enough for that, you haue his sure word for it, he hath said, <hi>aske and yee shall haue, seeke and you shall finde, knocke, and it shall be opened to you; and whatsoever you aske, if it be according</hi>

                  <hi>to his will, is shall be done to you</hi> So that is the thing we are chiefliy to looke vnto, to consider this faith in <hi>Gods</hi> promise; for men are ready to say, I doubt not but <hi>God</hi> is able, but all the question is, whether he be willing or no: And therefore, if wee will haue our prayers strong, and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, we must be carefull to strengthen our faith in his promise: for, as that is strong, so our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers doe more prevaile with <hi>God.</hi> It is a matter of much moment, and therefore wee will shew briefly how your faith may be strengthened, and likewise how you may know it.</p>
               <p>First, you shall strengthen your faith, if you consider the nature of <hi>God.</hi> Beloved, this is a <note place="margin">How saith may be strengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in prayer.

For example, (that I may o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen it to you a little, and shew you the way of making vse of the Attributes of <hi>God,</hi> in calling vpon him, and strengthning our faith from them) consider, first, the <hi>Iustice</hi> of God, (I will giue you examples, how the Saints haue still strengthned their faith from <hi>Gods</hi> Attributes) <hi>David</hi> vsed this

Argument, <hi>Lord, thou art Iust, I am Innocent;</hi> when <note place="margin">1 Iustice:</note> he telleth <hi>God</hi> of his Iustice, and withall expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth his owne innocencie, it is a strong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>David,</hi> you see, vseth it oft, (I neede not to name particulars. <hi>Lord reward mee ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to mine Innocencie, &amp;c.) thou knowest I am righteous,</hi> and mine enemies haue done mee thus, and thus much wrong, and thou art Iust: <hi>God</hi> cannot denie this; for it is a strong argument, that is taken from such an attribute.</p>
               <p>So againe, the <hi>goodnesse</hi> of God; <hi>Lord thou art</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">2 M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>full of mercie;</hi> on the other side, <hi>I am full of mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie:</hi> and when these are put together, it is a great meanes to strengthen our faith.

               <p>So againe, another Attribute of God is, his <note place="margin">3 Glory</note>

                  <hi>God,</hi> that is another of his attributes: and when we make our argument thus, <hi>Lord,</hi> thou art faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and I trust in thee, it is a strong argument, you know, it is an argument that prevailes much with men. A man is ready to say, hee trusts me, I must not deceiue him: Now the <hi>Lord</hi> keeps Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and mercie for ever. When we come, and vse this to him, <hi>Lord,</hi> thou art faithfull, thou hast said, thou wilt keep Covenant, and mercy for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, thou canst not doe otherwise, it is thy nature, thou canst not deny thy selfe, and I rest on thee, I depend on thee, in such a case, it cannot be, that the <hi>Lord</hi> should faile vs; I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap> a man will not faile one that trusts in him, certainly the <hi>Lord</hi> will
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:6314:59"/>
not, and that is an argument that is vsed oft, thou never failest them that trust thee.</p>
               <p>Then, besides the absolute attributes of God, consider his relatiue attributes: he is a <hi>father,</hi> and a <hi>Master:</hi> it is a strong argument, that is taken from these. If we goe to the <hi>Lord,</hi> and say, <hi>Lord,</hi> thou art a father, thou art a Master, thou art a husband, whither should the children goe, but to their father? whither should the wife goe, but to their father? whither should the wife goe, but to her husband? whither should the servants goe, but to their Master, to their Lord? <hi>Lord,</hi> thou hast commanded vs to provide for our owne, and <hi>he is worse then an Infidel that provides not for his owne. Lord,</hi> wee belong to thee, wee are thine. We see, <hi>David</hi> vseth this Argument, that <hi>God hath made him.</hi> You haue it oft in the Psalmes, that God hath made him, not onely his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but had made him againe, hee was his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, <hi>I am thy Servant,</hi> he oft vseth this Relatiue, that God was his God, and that hee was Gods servant, one that did belong to him, and that did depend vpon him. And surely (my Beloved) dependance, and seeking to God, is a great meanes to winne him to vs. When wee see an other depend vpon vs, one that is our<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, that is an effectuall motiue with men: the same is as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent with God, and therefore may strengthen our faith. Now, when I say these Arguments prevaile with God, the meaning is indeed, that they prevaile with vs, they strengthen our faith, they enable vs to beleeue, that God is readie to
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:6314:59"/>
helpe vs, and, when wee beleeue it, and trust vpon him, then indeede <hi>God</hi> is readie to second it; because, then wee are prepared, weo can then put up our desires in the prayer of faith; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, they are put vp with doubting, and that makes them vnacceptable to God, and vneffectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all. And now, as I haue shewed you the way, so likewise, in a word, we will shew you, when wee <note place="margin">How we may know that we pray in faith.</note> doe pray in faith, (for, that is a thing that is very vsefull) you shall know it by this (for I adde that, because I see the Scripture requires it, as such a maine condition, without which a man cannot be accepted, <hi>bee it done to thee according to thy faith,</hi> it is every where inculcated) you shall know it by the quietnesse of your minde, and your securitie. When a man calls vpon <hi>God,</hi> and his minde is quiet in it, it is a signe that hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues, and trusts in him, it is a prayer of faith. <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> you know, in that case, she <hi>looked no more sad,</hi> because she trusted in <hi>God;</hi> she believed the thing should be done: and therefore, if you finde solicitude, and perplexitie in your mindes, it is a signe that your prayers want so much faith; for if you did rest vpon God, you would bee quiet, and secure in him.</p>
               <p>Secondly, if you doe beleeue, you will conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue <note place="margin">2</note> in prayer. You know, it was an argument of the faith of the woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that she conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, that she would take no deniall; though the <hi>Lord</hi> denied her, and put her off, yet she held out: and what was the reason of it? because she be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved that he was the sonne of <hi>David,</hi> that hee
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:6314:60"/>
was mercifull, and that hee would heare in the end. So that continuance in prayer, is an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we doe beleeue the <hi>Lord.</hi> As a man that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeues, that such a man is within the house whom <note place="margin">Simile.</note> he desires to speake with, hee is content to waite long.

               <p>Likewise, an argument of faith is a diligent vse of those meanes, that God hath prescribed, and <note place="margin">3</note> no other.

Now, the heart of a man is holy then, when it is withdrawne from all things else, and particular to the <hi>Lord</hi> alone.

So that, now he that will haue an eye vpon credit, vpon vaine glory, vpon wealth, vpon his lusts, vpon any thing besides the <hi>Lord,</hi> that the heart is wedded to it, that hee bestowes any part of that coniugall affection vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, that should be wholly the <hi>Lords,</hi> this man is an vnholy man, his heart is not holy: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>And as the heart must be holy, so must the prayer be holy. When a man prayes to the <hi>Lord</hi> with respect vnto him, and hath an eye vpon him, and nothing else comes in to take away part of this prayer; if by respect, and worldly, and

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:6314:69"/>
as the <hi>Israelites</hi> had a charge never to make peace with <hi>Amalek;</hi> such a disposition is in such a man, he never makes peace with any sinne; though he be led captiue sometimes by it, yet he yeelds not to that captivity. This is to haue a pure heart, though his heart be defiled sometimes, as a vessell will be fowle, yet hee washeth, and renseth his heart, he never suffers it to continue muddy, and vncleane, and in a filthy disposition, but he hath a fountaine, a spring of grace within, that will worke out all impurity, as a spring workes out mudde: he that thus purifies himselfe still, though the fountaine be muddy, though there be many iniections, many temptations, many lusts, and sinnes, yet, if he be purified himselfe, that hee will suffer no sinne to mingle with his heart (as it were) to rest there, and to abide, and dwell there, to lye, and continue there, such a man hath a pure heart. We say that is pure, that is full of it selfe, and will haue no <hi>heterogenea,</hi> no other thing mingled with it, such a thing is pure, as pure oyle is nothing else but oyle. Now hee that hath a pure heart, is not he that hath simply nothing else, that hath no sinne mingled, that hath no drosse mingled with his wine, but hee that suffers it not to rest there; but as oyle and water, when you iumble them together, (as you <note place="margin">Simile.</note> know, when they are shaken together, they min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle) yet the oyle workes out, &amp; puifies it selfe, it will not suffer it selfe to abide with the water: a man, that is regenerate, a man that <hi>is borne of God,</hi> hath a seed remaining in him, though he doe

sin, yet, saith the Apostle, <hi>he cannot sin,</hi> that is, he doth not agree, hee doth not mingle with that sinne, it hath no rest in his heart, but he workes it out, in a passion; when he is shaken (as it were) when he is transported, when he is not himselfe, there may be a mixture, and the fountaine, &amp; the spring may be made muddy, yet let him come to himselfe, still he workes it out; that is to haue a pure heart. So that a man thus affected may come with boldnesse to the throne of grace, and not be discouraged; what though thy sinnes be many, and very great, and often repeated? yet, if thou finde in thy selfe such a disposition of purenesse, and holinesse, still to clense thy selfe, though thou be still polluted and defiled, I can assure thee, thy heart is pure, thou maist go with confidence to the throne of grace.</p>
               <p>But now you will say this to me, (that may be <note place="margin">Obiect.</note> obiected) why? but may not any carnall man say as much, hee sinnes against <hi>God,</hi> and comes and askes mercie, he comes, and cries for forgiuenes, and saith, he will sin no more; and yet he sinnes againe the next day, and <hi>addes drunkennesse to thirst;</hi> that is, his sinne and his repentance, they runne in a circle, as drunkennes, and thirst? how shall wee distinguish then betweene these two, that purifying disposition in the Saints, and those vanishing purposes, that carnall men may haue, that never had experience of the worke of grace, of that purity of heart, that wee speake of.</p>

So <hi>Saul</hi> would not waite vpon <hi>God,</hi> but he would offer sacrifice, this was to make hast. And so it is, when a man is discouraged; <hi>David,</hi> when the thing was not presently granted, he was ready to giue over, and falls to a desperate complaint, saying, <hi>one day I shall fall by the hands of Saul.</hi> Take heede of this, and when wee offer our prayers thus, learne to know what they are, learne to trust them, and to depend, and waite vpon <hi>God,</hi> say certainly, I shall not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, the thing shall surely be granted.</p>
