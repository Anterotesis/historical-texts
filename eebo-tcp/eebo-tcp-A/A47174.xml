            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Quakers,</hi> I thought fit to Tranſcribe ſome few Paſſages of <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> in a printed Book of his, called, <hi>Directions for weak diſtempered Chriſtians,</hi> that may be of ſome ſervice to that injured People, called in ſcorn <hi>Quakers.</hi> In pag. 142. of that Book, he ſaith, <hi>From my own Obſervation, which with a grieved Soul, I have made in this Generation, I hereby give warning to this and all ſucceeding Ages, that if they have any regard to Truth, or Charity, they take heed how they believe any factious partial Historian, or Divine, in any evil that he ſaith of the Party that he is against; for (though there be good and credible Perſons of moſt Parties, yet) you ſhall find that Paſſion and Partiality prevaileth againſt Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, Truth and Charity in most that are ſick of this Diſeaſe, and that the Envious Zeal which is deſcribed,</hi> James 3. <hi>doth make them think they do God Service, firſt in believing falſe Reports, and then in venting them againſt thoſe that their Zeal or Faction doth call the Enemies of Truth.</hi> And a little after he ſaith, pag. 143. <hi>Moſt Chriſtian is that Advice of</hi> Dr. Henry Moore, <hi>That all Parties of Chriſtians would mark all the good which is in other Parties, and be more forward to ſpeak of that, than of the Evil: And this</hi> (ſaith <hi>Baxter</hi>) <hi>would promote the Work of Charity in the Church, and the intereſt of Chriſtianity in the World; whereas the overlooking of all that's Good, and aggravating all the Evil (and falſly feigning more than is True) is the Work of greateſt Service to the Devil, &amp;c.</hi> Now if both <hi>Richard Baxter</hi> and <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> had well practiſed this Advice, they would not have been ſo Uncharitable to the People called <hi>Quakers.</hi>

And would it not be a great Cheat to ſay, That whereas the Law requireth two Witneſſes, and there is but one man that giveth witneſs to <hi>Cotton Mathers</hi> hearing, that C.M. ſhould alledge, his Ears are other two Witneſſes, becauſe they have heard him, and ſo they are three in all: And as great a Cheat and Fallacy is it, to call the witneſs of the Scripture the inward Witneſs of the Spirit, when they confeſs, the inward Work of the Spirit, is only <hi>Effective,</hi> to open the Ear to hear the outward Witneſs of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but not to ſpeak by any diſtinct Witneſs, to the inward Ear: And it is like that other Fallacy, as if <hi>James</hi> being required to give his Witneſs, he giveth it not by himſelf, but by <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>John</hi> being required to give his Witneſs, he giveth it by <hi>James,</hi> but neither of them by himſelf, or at leaſt the one not by himſelf; for when they are asked, By what do they know the Scriptures to be the Word of God? they anſwer, <hi>By the Spirit:</hi> And again, By what do they know the Spirit? they anſwer, <hi>By the Scripture.</hi> And thus the Fallacy and Falſhood both of the <hi>Confeſſion</hi> and of C.M. is detected, and G.K. is cleared from being no wiſe guilty of any Lye in the caſe. And what I ſaid of <hi>John Owen</hi> is true, for the Title and deſign of his Book is concerning <hi>The Self-Evidencing Authority of the holy Scriptures,</hi> only he confeſſeth the Spirits inward Work is neceſſary to let men ſee or know it; but that is no proper Witneſs, more than a mans hearing is one Witneſs, and the thing heard is another. I do therefore Appeal to all ſober, impartial and judicious Readers, Whether not I, but <hi>Cotton Mather,</hi> be not convicted of groſs Lying or Falſhood, and whether the Society he belongs unto, ought not to bring him to Repentance for ſuch Crimes, to uſe ſome of his own words.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Second</hi> Argument is, <hi>That I am guilty of having committed moſt

horrible Blaſphemy againſt the holy Spirit of God, which is the unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Sin</hi>; And though he doth charge this one while poſitively, yet another while <hi>If I have not the certain, yet fearful Marks of it</hi>; and <hi>my Sin is very like that Sin</hi>; and yet again charging it poſitively on me, <hi>That I have taken part with the Phariſees in dorg that impardonable Injury to the Eternal Spirit of God</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But how doth he prove any thing of this to have the leſt ſhow or ſhadow of truth? Why, becauſe, as he alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>I called his and his Brethrens Prayers, more than once, a Conjuring of the Devil, and do put on them the ſtile of Charms and Spells; by which Prayers,</hi> he alledgeth, <hi>he and his Brethren did cast out the Devil, that did Bodily poſſeſs ſome Young People, and that therefore their Prayers were the ſpecial Operations of the holy Ghoſt, which I blaſpheme, and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have committed the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>npardonable Sin.</hi> But I Anſwer; 1<hi>st,</hi> As I ſaid in my Book called, <hi>A Refutation, &amp;c.</hi> I am little concerned whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not theſe Young People were bewitched, or had a Diabolical Poſſeſſion; further than to take notice, That C.M. will have it to be ſo, to make the ſimple believe, that his and his Brethrens Prayers did conjure the Devil, and caſt him out; by which it is moſt clearly apparent, to every one of common ſence, that I did not mean that his or his Brethrens Prayers were done by any Diabolical Art or Craft of Conjuration, for I do not think them to be Conjurers, but that they would have People believe, that by ſome divine Power of Exor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm, as was frequent in the primitive Church, they did conjure the Devil, which is as widely different from his Perverſion, as Eaſt from Weſt. Now I cannot believe that they had this divine Gift of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orciſm, which was a Miraculous Gift in thoſe primitive Times (that Popiſh Prieſts do alſo pretend to have, and many ſtrongly affirm, they have cured many by their Prayers) becauſe they commonly ſay, <hi>That Immediate Revelaiion, with the Gifts of Miracles, are ceaſed:</hi> How then can they have them? And I appeal to all ſober <hi>Readers,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> hath not groſly perverted my words, that becauſe I did not own them to have a divine Power of Exorciſm, whereby to conjure the Devil, as if I did affirm their Prayers were <hi>a Conjuring of the Devil,</hi> which inſtead of affirming, I ſtrongly denyed, as the <hi>Reader</hi> may ſee in my Book called <hi>A Refutation, &amp;c.</hi> and by this, and his other man.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:94364:12"/>
he doth ſo palpably pervert my words to a plain contrary ſence, that is obvious to them of the weakeſt Capacity. Nor did I call his and his Brethrens Prayers <hi>Charms and Spells,</hi> as he alledgeth; ſee my Book p. 71, 72. only I ſaid, <hi>That ſeeing they generally mock at any, at this day laying claim to divine Inſpiration and Revelation, I cannot own their Prayers to be true, they are liker to Charms and Spells of ſuperſtitious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, &amp;c.</hi> But this will not infer that I did really call or judge them. <hi>Charms</hi> or <hi>Spells</hi>; for I think they are not Witches, except in that ſenſe uſed by <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 3.1. becauſe they bewitch (not the Bodies, but) the Souls of People from believing and obeying the Truth; for I may ſay one thing is liker to another thing, and yet not ſay, it is that very thing; As if I ſhould ſay, C.M. is liker to a Phariſee or Maſs-Prieſt, than to a true Miniſter of Chriſt, doth it therefore follow, that I judge he is really a Phariſee or Maſs-Prieſt? or, to uſe his Phraſe, were the Tranſmigration of Souls a Truth, if I ſhould ſay, <hi>Cotton Mather</hi> is liker <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Silver-Smith (who accuſed <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe his and his Brethren's Craft was in danger to be ſet at naught, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.27.) than to a true Miniſter of Chriſt, Doth it therefore follow, that I judge that C.M. is <hi>Demetrius</hi> riſen again from the dead? By no means And for his comparing me to <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Copper-Smith, it is fooliſh and envious; I honour and eſteem highly both <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine and himſelf, and all the Prophets and Apoſtles of the Lord; and therefore I do nothing reſemble <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> the Copper-Smith; but C.M. and his Brethren do too much reſemble, not only <hi>Alexander</hi> the Copper-Smith, who oppoſed <hi>Paul,</hi> but <hi>Demetrius</hi> the Silver-Smith, that they are in ſuch fear their Craft be ſet at nought by the People call'd <hi>Quakers,</hi> elſe why do they make ſuch a ſtir about their Wages and Hire?

And true Believers may have it witneſſed to them (as many have had and daily have) by the inward Teſtimony of Gods Spirit, <hi>That their ſins are forgiven them, and that they belong unto God,</hi> and that without all logical and argumentative way of Syllogiſms, that as many faithful Souls have not skill to form, ſo many Hypocrites de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive themſelves with ſuch a way of arguing themſelves to be ſincere. But ſome <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> have acknowledged, That there is another far more evident, clear and ſatisfactory way that ſome have, whereby to be aſſured, that their ſins are forgiven, without any ſuch way of Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logyſm, as particularly my Country-man <hi>William Guthergy,</hi> in his
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:94364:25"/>
his printed Book concerning <hi>Perſonal Covenanting with God,</hi> and he calleth it <hi>A felt Arms full of the holy God, filling the Soul with God, as he is Love, Life and Liberty; and though it is no audible Voice</hi> (<hi>viz.</hi> to the outward Ear) <hi>yet it doth countervail that of God to</hi> Daniel, <hi>O Man! greatly beloved; and is like to that which paſſed from Chriſt to</hi> Mary, <hi>when he ſaid,</hi> Mary, <hi>and ſhe anſwered</hi> Rabboni: And ſurely here was no way of ſyllogiſing. In his 4<hi>th Aſſertion</hi> he doth alſo fail in ſtating the Queſtion; for, <hi>firſt,</hi> we grant, <hi>That the Day of Salvation is expired towards many men now alive, and they are left without any ſaving Light in them:</hi> 2<hi>dly,</hi> we grant, <hi>That the clear and bright Day of Salvation hath not yet appeared unto many, but it is as yet Night unto them; and to others it is as a little dawning; but to others clear Day</hi>; which anſwers to that of <hi>Paul, Now is the accepted Time, now is the Day of Salvation,</hi> to wit, to ſuch who had Chriſt crucified and raiſed again, livingly and effectually preached to them by Chriſts faithful Meſſengers; but yet even to ſuch who are in the Night ſtate, and are in Darkneſs, to whom the clear Day of God hath not appeared, ſome divine Light ſhineth in their Darkneſs, and that Light, though ever ſo ſmall, is of a ſaving tendency, and doth prepare the way of the Lord inwardly, as <hi>John</hi>'s outward Miniſtration prepared the Way of the Lord, as he came outwardly; and even inwardly, the Law and the Prophets go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the clear Manifeſtation of Chriſt and his Goſpel; ſo that the Law even inwardly (as well as outwardly) is a Schoolmaſter to bring them who are under it, to Chriſt. Nor do we ſay, That the Light doth reveal in every man all that we muſt know, in order to Salvation, upon its firſt appearance, or in its firſt Miniſtration; for we diſtinguiſh betwixt the various inward Miniſtrations of the Light and Spirit, and teach, <hi>That the former makes way for the latter, as it is well improved</hi>; and as he that goeth up a Stair or Ladder, muſt begin at the loweſt Step or Round, and ſo by degrees, and in proceſs of time, getteth up higher, untill he come to the place where he would be; and as the ſojourning of the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the Wilderneſs, had its ſeveral Removes, which were Typical, of the Souls inward progreſs, from ſpiritual <hi>Aegypt</hi> to the ſpiritual <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſo the Souls of men have their ſeveral inward and ſpiritual Sojournings from one degree to another, until they receive the end of their Faith, which is the Salvation of their Souls, as it is written in the <hi>Pſalms, They go from strength to ſtrength, &amp;c.</hi> And it is a great Perverſion in <hi>C. Mather,</hi> that becauſe I
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94364:26"/>
blame them for denying, <hi>That there is any Light in men generally, that is ſufficient to enable them to do any Work acceptable to God,</hi> as if therefore I did hold, <hi>That every man hath ſo much Grace &amp; Illumination, as doth enable him to do any</hi> (i.e. whatſoever) <hi>Work acceptable to God:</hi> For, <hi>All men Not to be able to do any work acceptable to God,</hi> And <hi>All men To be able to do any or every VVork acceptable to God,</hi> are not Contradictory, as being both U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal; and therefore they are both falſe, and as two Univerſals are not Contradictory, and are both falſe, ſo two Particulars are not Contradictory, when the one is Poſitive and the other Negative, and therefore may be both True; As it is true, <hi>That ſome men are good,</hi> and <hi>That ſome men are not good</hi>; ſo it is true, <hi>That ſome good Works may be done by ſome men,</hi> and yet it is as true, <hi>That they cannot at that time do ſome other good VVorks</hi>; for it is a good Work to believe in Chriſt crucified and raiſed again, and to love him as ſuch; and yet we do not ſay, that the Light in every man doth either teach or enable every man at firſt ſo to do, for that cannot be done without ſome ſpecial Revelation or Illumination; but yet that more common and general Illumination, where it is well and duely improved, doth enable men to do ſome other good things, that prepareth the Souls of men to receive that more ſpecial Illumination that cometh from the ſame Author and Fountain, and ſo is Introductory to that more ſpecial; for the Law is Introductory to the Goſpel (and yet hath the Goſpel hid in it, as in a Seed) as one Natural Science is introductory to another, as the Science of natural Phyſick is introductory to the Science of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and common Arithmetick is introductory to the more abſtruſe and recondite parts of Mathematical Learning; for the Operation of the Law inwardly doth ſo convince the Soul of ſin, and doth ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to the Soul its weakneſs and ſhortneſs in Obedience, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſome things that it doth, which are good, after a ſort, that it maketh the Soul ſick, and ſo to need the Phyſition, which is Chriſt, even crucified and raiſed again, as the Myſtery of him is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly revealed and applyed to the Soul by the Spirit. In his 5<hi>th Aſſertion,</hi> he doth alſo groſly prevaricate, and pervert the ſtate of the Queſtion; for we do not ſay, That Chriſt is ſo in the Wicked or Unconverted as he is in the Saints, but after a far other manner; for he is in the Saints by <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> and <hi>Communion</hi> with them, and giveth great and glorious Manifeſtations of his Glory; whereas in others, he is not in them by any Union or Communion, yet he is ſo in them, as to
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94364:26"/>
operate in them, and to reveal and diſcover ſome things in them, that are ſuitable to their preſent ſtate, in order to their Converſion: Nor do we ſay, <hi>That Chriſt is perſonally in the Saints,</hi> as ſome imagine.</p>
            <p>And as to his Queſtion, <hi>How we ſhall know Light within from Thought within? I Anſwer</hi>; If he mean by Thought within, a good Thought or Thoughts, they are diſtinguiſhed as the cauſe and effect; for the divine Light within is the cauſe of every good Thought and Deſire, as of every good Word and Work; but all evil Thoughts proceed not from the Light, but from the Darkneſs; and the Light within doth as plainly diſtinguiſh betwixt good and bad Thoughts, and other Motions, as the outward Light of the Sun helpeth us to diſtinguiſh betwixt things white and black, or ſtraight and crooked; but as blind men cannot judge of Colours, ſo who are greatly blinded with Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and Unbelief againſt the Light within, (as C.M. is) can but very little diſtinguiſh or know good from evil, except in things notoriouſly groſs; nor was it the true Light in <hi>Saul,</hi> that approved him in his Perſecution, but pricked him in his Conſcience, and witneſſed againſt him, if he had hearkned to it; but as a man in his heat of Paſſion hearkeneth not to true Reaſon, but is Deaf to it, though it be in him; ſo men being blinded and hardened with ſin, doth not give due regard either to true Reaſon, or the true divine Light, which are both in them notwithſtanding; and yet even thoſe men when they become more cool and calm, may, and do hearken to the dictates of both.</p>
            <p>And for his other Queſtion, <hi>Whether their Magiſtrates (viz.</hi> the Quakers) <hi>ever had a Light which directed them to puniſh a filthy VVoman for expoſing her ſelf ſtark Naked before their Eyes in a publick Aſſembly, to prove her Attainment of that Innocency which is without ſhame?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>

according to us, <hi>The Counſel</hi> (or Decree) <hi>of God, and conſequently the very Eſſence of God, being one therewith, doth depend on the free will of man</hi>; Which is a moſt groſs and wretched Perverſion; for we ſay, the Dec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ree and Counſel of God, doth extend to all evil Actions of men per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſively, but not effectively, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo as not to be the Cauſe and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminer of them; and Gods Decree and Counſel hath no Cauſe to depend upon, without God himſelf, as he doth falſly inſinuate againſt us: Nor is Gods Permiſſion, as concerning Evil Actions, as <hi>Judas</hi> betraying Chriſt, and the <hi>Jews</hi> crucifying him, a bare Permiſſion, as if God only did look on, as an idle Spectator, which is moſt abſurd to imagine; but he moſt juſtly, moſt wiſely and moſt ſoveraignly bounds and limits all evil Actions of men, that they neither do, nor can do any thing but what is for the glory of God, and the good of his choſen, as it is written, <hi>The Wrath of Man ſhall praiſe thee, and the remainder of it thou wilt reſtrain.</hi> But C.M. and his brethren are too guilty of Blaſphemy, that affirm, <hi>That all evil Actions of Men and Devils, come to paſs by the Effective Decree of God, that doth infallibly and inevitably determine and move them to the ſame</hi>; and ſo ſay the Ranters, fathering all their wicked Actions upon God.

            <p>In his 7<hi>th Aſſertion,</hi> he proceedeth in the like groſs Perverſion, and miſ-ſtating of things; and as to the firſt part of it, fighteth againſt his own ſhadow, and not my Aſſertion; for I granted, <hi>That God hath choſen all the Heirs of Salvation unto Faith and Holineſs, as the means, and unto Eternal Salvation and Glory, as the end, in Chriſt Jeſus, before the Foundation of the World</hi>; and alſo, I have granted, <hi>That all are not elected,</hi> nor are any elected who periſh finally; and yet this doth not infer eternal Reprobation, becauſe <hi>Elected</hi> and <hi>Reprobated</hi> are not Contradictory Terms, as I have formerly declared; and yet he hath not proved that they are; but maketh a noiſe ſtrongly aſſerting what he doth not prove. Nor doth it follow that <hi>Reprobation</hi> is before the Foundation of the World, becauſe Gods Decree and Purpoſe to deſtroy all finally Impenitent Sinners, is before the Foundation of the World; for though Gods Decree be before all Time, yet it doth reſpect all Reprobates, as it doth conſider them in Time, having refuſed all the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94364:27"/>
tender Offers of Gods Grace and Mercy unto the very laſt. And as Gods Decree of creating men, doth not infer, that men were created from Eternity, or that mens Creation is co-evous with Gods Decree, ſo nor doth it follow, that the Reprobation of men finally Impenitent is co-evous with Gods Decree; for <hi>Reprobation</hi> is not the Decree of God, as <hi>C.M.</hi> doth ſtrongly aſſert, but doth no wiſe prove. And if ſome ſhould ſay, (as I know ſome do ſay) <hi>That Election, though in being before the Foundation of the World in Chriſt, is not ſimply or only the Decree of God</hi> (as it is an Immanent Act of God) <hi>but is ſome-what by way of an Effect, reſulting or flowing from Gods Decree, existing in Chriſt the Head and Mediator of all Gods Elect, before the Foundation of the World</hi>: For as C.M. cannot diſprove it, as contrary to Scripture, ſo it is not inconſiſtent with what divers ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In his 8<hi>th Aſſertion</hi> he is wholly idle and impertinent; for we own as much as he, <hi>That there is in God, the Father, the Son and the Spirit, and that they are One in Being, and Three in relative Attributes and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties</hi>; and we diſlike nothing but the unſcriptural invented Names of [<hi>Three Perſons</hi>] for which <hi>Calvin</hi> hath ſufficiently excuſed us, as I have above ſhowed.</p>
            <p>In his 9<hi>th Aſſertion</hi> he wholly fighteth with his own ſhadow, and giveth up the Cauſe, acknowledging, <hi>That the Price paid by our Lord in his Death, was indeed ſufficient for all Mankind, and that the benefit of it is tendered and proffered unto all Indefinitely, if they will believe</hi>; but he ſhould have told us how the benefit of it is tendered unto all, ſeeing many Millions of men never had it outwardly preached to them, nor ever had any outward Teſtimony of it by men; and if he would ſtand to this, the Controverſie in this Particular would be at an end.

But for his Inferences and Conſequences, which he would fix upon us, moſt perverſly, we utterly deny them to flow juſtly from our innocent Faith, according to Scripture, which is, <hi>That Chriſt dyed for all men, &amp;c.</hi> As that, <hi>First, The Virtue and Succeſs of our Lords Death depends upon the Free VVill of Man:</hi> 2dly, <hi>That man in the principal in his own Salvation:</hi> 3dly, <hi>That the Number of Perſons intereſted in our Lords Death, is not certain</hi> (for we ſay, none have a true and real Intereſt in Chriſt, or in his Death, but ſincere Believers) 4thly, <hi>That Simon Peter was no more beholden to the Merit of our Lord, than</hi> Simon Magus, <hi>or any that periſh</hi> (Though it will be hard for C.M. to prove, that <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was a Reprobate) And 5thly, <hi>That God in ſending his bleſſed Son to dye, had as full a purpoſe to ſave them that Periſh, as them that ſhall be ſaved:</hi> Theſe, and the like abſurd and Illogical or unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Conſequences we altogether deny, they being only C.M's Perverſion.</p>
            <p>In his 10<hi>th Aſſertion</hi> he doth as groſly pervert the ſtate of the Queſtion, as in any of the former; for we deny not, but affirm, <hi>That our Juſtification is by the Righteouſneſs or Obedience of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt imputed unto us</hi>; but we alſo ſay, <hi>It is imputed to none but ſuch who have Faith, Repentance and ſincere Obedience</hi>; and that is true inward Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, wrought in them by the Spirit of Chriſt; and though <hi>Faith,</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> and <hi>Obedience</hi> are not the Foundation of our Juſtification, yet they are the Terms and Condition of it, as I have ſufficiently ſhowed in my former printed Treatiſes; nor doth <hi>Edward Burrough</hi> and <hi>VV.

            <p>IN his 12<hi>th Aſſertion</hi> he doth not fairly ſtate the Queſtion, eſpecially in the Explanation of it; for he ſhould have diſtinguiſhed betwixt the ſtate of <hi>Servants</hi> and <hi>Sons of the Free Woman,</hi> and ſo betwixt Saints by way of Inchoation or Initiation, and Saints by way of Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as betwixt Corn in the Bud or Blade, or green Ear, when it is in danger of blaſting, and ripe Corn that is paſt all danger of blaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; for as to this latter, I did grant in my former printed Treatiſes, in unity with my faithful Brethren, that there is a confirmed ſtate in Faith and Sanctification, wherein the Saints perſevere to the end of all Tryals, and from which they cannot fall away; and the Faith of ſuch is more precious than Gold that periſheth, &amp; endureth all Tryals and Tentations, even as true Gold endureth the Fire, and looſeth nothing in it; but all have not attained to this State, which is indeed the only proper ſtate of Salvation, that is as the Harbour or Port of Safety to the toſſed Marriner; and till the Soul arrive to this ſtate, it is but as a Ship expoſed to the Waves of the Tempeſtuous Sea: Alſo, I readily grant, that none of Gods elect can finally fall away; for his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

That the temporary Faith that may be lost, is not falſe</hi>; and if not falſe, then true after a ſort; although I grant, it is not that Faith of Gods Elect that's more precious than Gold, that endureth all fiery Tryals, yet is of a ſaving tendency, and ſuch who have it, it they did well and duely improve it, might in due time arrive to that Confirmation in Faith and Holineſs, that cannot be totally &amp; finally loſt: But whether the Faith that may be loſt, and the Faith that cannot be loſt, differ in Kind or Specie, or only in Degree, it being too Nice, and rather Philoſophical, and too Logical, I did not (as I ſaid in my former printed Book) ſee cauſe to enquire, ſeeing it is a very great diſpute, among Schollars, what maketh a Diſtinction of things, in Kind or Specie, ſome affirming, That the <hi>Mettles</hi> and <hi>Elements</hi> differ not in Specie, others contradicting, and ſaying they do.</p>

            <p>In his eſſaying to prove his 16<hi>th Aſſertion,</hi> he ſhoweth himſelf extreamly weak, as if becauſe God commanded the <hi>Jews</hi> to keep the <hi>Seventh Day for a Sabbath,</hi> from the beginning of the World, in the fourth Commandment, therefore <hi>he commandeth the Chriſtians in the ſame fourth Commandment to keep the first Day.</hi> But I need ſay no more on this Head, but refer him to his much eſteemed <hi>Calvin,</hi> for his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation, who in that doth fully agree with us, as generally do all the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and many in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In his 17<hi>th Aſſertion</hi> he is as weak and abuſive as in any of the former, That he &amp; his Brethren cannot own true Piety to be eſſential to a true Miniſter of Chriſt, to make a neceſſary Proviſion for the everlaſting Peace of renewed Souls, which cannot be ſaved without their Aſſertion, <hi>viz. That true Piety is not eſſential to a true Miniſter, for this would make their Converſion or Peace wholly depend upon Grace in the heart of a Miniſter.</hi> But this is a moſt groſs Abuſe and Pervertion, and a moſt ſilly trick or cheat, to palliate or excuſe their abſurd Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which a Child may diſcover; for the Contradictory Aſſertion, <hi>viz. That true Piety is eſſential to a true Miniſter of Chriſt, doth not make, that the Converſion of the Souls dependeth on Grace in the Miniſter,</hi> becauſe many Thouſands of Souls have been and are daily converted without any Miniſter, good or bad, by reading or hearing the holy Scriptures, the holy Spirit aiding and concurring therein, and this is generally confeſſed by all <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> And if ſome think <hi>they were converted by means of ſome Miniſters that were afterwards ſound to be Hypocrites,</hi> all that this can prove, is, not that they are not converted, but that they are in ſome miſtake about the man whom they thought was the Inſtrument of it, and was not. And for my ſaying, <hi>It is no wonder that</hi> New-England <hi>abounds with ſuch Impious Miniſters</hi>; I did argue <hi>ad hominem,</hi> according to your Principle; for, to ſay, <hi>True Piety is not eſſential to a true Minister of Chriſt,</hi> openeth a door to let in a ſtood of Impious Miniſters upon the People of <hi>New-England</hi>; and it is to be feared, this abſurd Principle hath too much open'd a Door unto them: And for all your ſtrict pretended Tryal of men, before they enter into the Miniſtry, do ye try them concerning their Piety? if nay, then
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94364:30"/>
ye open a door to them who may be really Impious, if they have but wit enough to be Hypocrites, and only ſeemingly Pious, if Yea, this contradicts your Doctrine, who ſay, <hi>ye have no certain way to try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men be really Pious or not</hi>; for ye reject all pretence to a diſcerning of Spirits, whereby to know who are really Pious, and who not; and the Marks given by <hi>Paul,</hi> whereby to try men, before they be owned to be either <hi>Biſhops</hi> (i. e. <hi>Overſeers,</hi> or <hi>Pastors</hi>) or <hi>Deacons,</hi> were not out-ſide Marks of Holyneſs only, that Hypocrites may have, but to be really <hi>ſober, just, holy, temperate</hi> (<hi>Tit.</hi> 1.8.) and where theſe Virtues are, they do as certainly and infallibly diſcover themſelves in words and works, to the ſpiritual Diſcerners, as Spices and precious Oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Perfumes, diſcover their ſweet ſmell and odour to them who have the right uſe of their natural ſmelling.</p>
            <p>And as to his Queſtion, <hi>How People may know whether we have an Immediate Call to the Miniſtry?</hi> To this I <hi>Anſwer</hi>; There muſt be ſome ſpiritual Ability or Gift of Diſcerning in ſuch, who are able to know ſuch a thing; for it is only the ſpiritual Man that is able to judge of ſpiritual things; and whomſoever God calleth to the Miniſtry by his Power and Spirit inwardly revealed (that is immediate) his Power and Preſence, according to his faithful Promiſe, doth go along with them, ſo that ſome that hear them, though not all, are the Seal of their Miniſtry, and the Blind are made to ſee, the Deaf to hear, the Lame to walk, the Dumb to ſpeak, and the Dead to live, to wit, ſpiritually. And as this was <hi>Luther</hi>'s anſwer to the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> that asked for ſome Signs to prove his and his Brethrens Call, who did commonly upbraid them, <hi>That they never ſo much as cured a Lame Horſe</hi>; ſo it may ſuffice for our Anſwer; for whether C.M. believe it or not, we have had the Seal of our Miniſtry, that many by means of our Teſtimony have had their inward Eyes opened, and have been turned from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Light, and from the Power of Sathan unto God, and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Change hath had its evident Effects of <hi>Chriſtian Piety, Sobriety</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> in their outward Converſation. But ſuch who were blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and hardned againſt the Spirit of Truth, did not know Chriſt nor his Apoſtles and Miniſters, and therefore we cannot expect that ſuch can know us. And this Queſtion of C.M. may be eaſily retorted upon him, that doth ſo confidently affirm. <hi>That there are ſo many Ministers in</hi> New-England, <hi>that have and uſe all true Piety</hi>; let him tell us, how he or they can prove, that they are really Holy, and that their Holy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

<q>Gods more near and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate imparting himſelf to the Soul that is prepared for that Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by divine Love, Humility and Reſignation, in the way of a vital Touch and Sence, is a thing poſſible in it ſelf, and will be a great part of our Heaven. That Glory is begun in Grace, and God is pleaſed to give ſome excellent Souls the happy Antepaſt. That holy men in antient Times have ſought and gloried in this enjoyment, &amp; never complain ſo ſorely as when it was with-held &amp; interrupted. That the Expreſſions of Scripture run infinitely this way, and the beſt of Modern good men, do from their own Experience atteſt it. That this ſpiritualizeth Religion, and renders its enjoyments more comfortable and delicious. That it keeps the Soul under a vivid ſenſe of God, and is a grand ſecurity againſt Temptation. That it holds it ſteady amid the flatteries of a proſperous ſtate, and gives it the moſt grounded Anchorage and ſupport amid the Waves of an adverſe Condition. That 'tis the Nobleſt Encouragement to Virtue, and the biggeſt aſſurance of an happy Immortality. I ſay, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered theſe weighty things, and wondered at the careleſneſs and prejudice of Thoughts that occaſion'd <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

I am convinced, that things of Guſt and Reliſh muſt be judg'd by the ſentient and vital Faculties, and not by the poetical Exerciſes of ſpeculative Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings: And upon the whole, I believe infinitely, that the divine Spirit affords its ſenſible Preſence, and immediate beatifick Touch to ſome rare Souls, who are diveſted of carnal Self, and mundane Pleaſures, abſtracted from the Body by Prayer and holy Meditation; ſpiritual in their Deſires, and calm in their Affections, devout Lovers of God, and Virtue, and tenderly affectionate to all the World; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
