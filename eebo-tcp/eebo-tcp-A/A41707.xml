            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

READER.</head>
            <p>THIS Diſcourſe following had
never ſeen the light, if <hi>Jack
Presbyter</hi> would have permitted
the Author to be quiet; the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple
here defended is a plain Truth, juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
by our Saviour's life, That an Afflicted,
is more Eligible than a Sinful ſtate, which
I preſume was ſound Primitive Doctrine, and
will be always ſo eſteemed by the Regular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant:
Notwithſtanding it gave great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaſt
to the Presbyterian Brotherhood. One
Gentleman would have had me Whipt for ſaying
it was Irrational and Irreligious to commit a
Sin that Good might come thereof. Another
told me I forgot to <hi>Preach Jeſus Chriſt and
him Crucified;</hi> and yet (if I miſtake not)
<hi>he was a man of Sorrows, and acquainted
with grief, yet knew no ſin, niether was
guile found in his mouth.</hi> A third Zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drunk
<pb facs="tcp:61785:3"/>
Monſeur Complimented me in the
Queens Bath, that Mr. <hi>Topham</hi> (a Serjeant
at Arms, I think) was my very good Friend,
and deſired a Copy of what I delivered, and
that if I had any Service to him, he would
effectually preſent it; my Anſwer was very
ſharp, and being publickly known abroad,
needs not now be repeated. Hang the Raſcal,
ſaid a fourth, He Preached for a Cardinals
Cap at the coming in of the Pope; by which
you may gueſs what will become of <hi>William
Goulde,</hi> if theſe Gentlemen once give Law
to the Church and State. But I have how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
printed it, to ſhew I dare be honeſt, and
will not be huft out of my Integrity by Noiſe
and Tumult, for I have learned <hi>to fear him
who can caſt body and ſoul into Eternal
torment,</hi> more than a Speaker, or a Pope, or
the Reprimand of either or both.</p>
            <p>In this Diſcourſe I affirm and will prove it,
that by the Laws of God, by the Principles of
the true Proteſtant Religion, publiquely Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> the Bill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Duke of <hi>York</hi> is not to be Juſtified,
and my Reaſon is grounded in the Text, It is
not lawful to chuſe Sin to avoid being Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted;
and that Bill which renders a man dead
<pb facs="tcp:61785:3"/>
in Law for want of Grace, will bring more
Confuſion unto a State than it pretends to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void,
and approaches too near the Doctrine of
the Conclave, of the Popes power in diſpoſing
the Kingdoms of an Heretique.</p>
            <p>I declare my ſelf as free from Popery, as any
Zealot of the Kirk, and in two great Points,
the Regall and Epiſcopal Government, I have
a greater Value for theſe than any Presbyterian
or Independent either Rigid or Moderate. He
that ſhall conſider how the Jeſuitical Party in
the Conventicle of <hi>Trent,</hi> undermined the
Power of King and Biſhop to give the Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction
of both to their Lord God the Pope, and
compare it with the practices of the Covenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Presbyter againſt Prince and Biſhop, to
make them both Truckle under the Lay-Elder-Government,
will think it unreaſonable to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
theſe later, whilſt the others are ſubject
to the Penalties of the Act of the <hi>35th.</hi> of
Queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> If <hi>Jack-Presbyter</hi> think
any Injury done him, I hope the two follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Arguments will clear me from his Charge
in all moderate Mens Judgment. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The
Votes of Non-Addreſſes to, or receiving any
Meſſages from the late Martyr'd Monarch,
was certainly Cozen-German (if not more
<pb facs="tcp:61785:4"/>
nearly related) to the Bull of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> be it remembred that
thoſe Votes were never recalled, till the King
was under the Armed Power of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> The Bill againſt Biſhops root
and branch, ſolemnly attending upon the
League and Covenant, was as much prejudicial
to the Epiſcopal Government of the Church
of <hi>England,</hi> as any thing ſaid or Acted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
that Ancient order, by any Jeſuit Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts
in the Council aforeſaid. Of theſe two
Arguments (if the Reader dares be Honeſt
and Candid) he is left to be the Judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

            </epigraph>
            <p>TO have the favour to receive Commands, and
the Meekneſs to obey them, is the ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Angels: and it is hence concluded by
<hi>Gerſon</hi> (the late learned Chancellor of <hi>Paris</hi>) that if
an Angel were to ſet out himſelf in luſtre and triumph
in a <hi>Magnificat,</hi> it would be rather in the bleſſed Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
ſtile as a ſervant of God, than a Prince of ſo
many Myriads of Subjects: would the Scripture al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
me that kind of Idolatry, the binding my Faith
or obedience to any one infallible earthly Judge or
Prince, were it reconcileable to my Creed, it would
be certainly with my intereſt to get into that poſture
of Obedience; yet we find Subjection ſo hard a leſſon
to the Sons of men, that neither Wrath nor Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
can prevail with us to obey God, (or for his
ſake) to ſubmit to our lawful Superiours: This is
ſo well underſtood by wiſe Princes and States, that
they have invented new ways to entertain buſie and
active Spirits, to keep them from tampering with
their publique Laws and Conſtitutions. The body
of a Flea or an Ant, will afford a Vertuoſo many
choice Obſervations, demonſtrating Problems, ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Phaenomena's and drawing Schemes and Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grams,
may divert your buſie Mercurial Witts, from
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:61785:5"/>
making new Ideas and Platforms for Churches and
Kingdoms: the ground of which Averſneſs is the
want of a right underſtanding of that great principle
of our Chriſtian Religion, the going the high-way
of the Croſs to the Kingdom of heaven; and hence
it comes that Chriſtianity is ſcandalized by Recuſants,
Popiſh and Puritan, who prefer Rebellion before
Martyrdom, and ſo are lyable to <hi>Elihu's</hi> reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for chuſing <hi>iniquity rather than affliction.</hi> I ſhall
ſumm up the ſubſtance of the whole Text into one
plain and Genuine Obſervation, That Sin is neither
eligible in its ſelf, nor to be choſen to avoid the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
of Perſecution.</p>
            <p>Sin I ſay cannot (properly taken) be the object
of a rational mans, or true Chriſtians choice; <hi>Firſt,</hi>
if conſidered in its ſelf or Conſequences; <hi>Secondly,</hi> if
we look on Sin as oppoſite to Gods Eſſence and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes;
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> if we conſider it as the tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of Gods Laws; <hi>Fourthly,</hi> as deſtructive to our
own Souls; <hi>Fifthly,</hi> as the Original of all the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers
of our Bodies; and <hi>Sixthly,</hi> as the occaſion
of Death in all kinds, Temporal, Spiritual, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
as Divines diſtinguiſh according to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures;
<hi>Laſtly,</hi> (which includes the <hi>ſecond</hi> branch of
the <hi>Theſis,</hi>) it cannot be the object of a rational choice
as put in the ballance with the greateſt Preſſures,
Afflictions and Difficulties. None can deny (conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the preſent juncture of Affairs) but that I have
pitched on a ſeaſonable Subject of Diſcourſe, and (if
you will pardon my haſty Conceptions) I reſolve to
ſpeak what is very Plain, Innocent, and Honeſt;
conſonant with the primitive rule of Reforming, and
preſervng Churches recommended by <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his
Apoſtles, and their immediate and beſt Succeſſors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:61785:5"/>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Sin is not the object of a Rational man's
choice conſidered either in its ſelf or Conſequences.
1. Not with reſpect to its ſelf, for it is <hi>de numero in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eligibilium</hi>
(as the Schools ſpeak.) There is no Form
nor Beauty in it that we ſhould deſire it: Election is
the act of the Will, whoſe adequate object is good;
and ſo Sin, which is <hi>malum in ſe,</hi> evil in its ſelf,
cannot be properly ſaid to be elected: hence it comes
to paſs that ſuch who have not their Senſes exerciſed
to diſcern between Good and Evil, chuſe Sin by a
miſtake, thinking it to be good, putting light for dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and darkneſs for light (<hi>Iſaiah</hi> 5. 20.) thus Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> (rather <hi>Saul</hi>) before he was Converted, verily
thought with himſelf, that he ought to doe many
things againſt <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth;</hi> and Chriſt tells his
Diſciples, that ſome that Kill'd them by a miſtaken
zeal, ſhould think they did an acceptable ſervice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
God: thus Iniquity in practice paſſeth for Duty,
and Error in opinion for Truth, and Evil is choſen
<hi>ſub ratione boni,</hi> not for its own ſake, but under the
notion of being at leaſt ſeemingly good. Others
chuſe Sin that good may come thereof, that God
may have glory or themſelves advantage by it: This
was objected againſt St. <hi>Paul</hi> and his Doctrine, which
in great Diſdain he rejected, <hi>not as we are ſlanderouſly
reported, and as ſome affirm that we ſay, Let us doe
evil, that good may come: whoſe damnation is juſt.
(Rom.</hi> 3. 8.) Others chuſe evil, to eſcape Danger by
it, elect the evil of Sin to avoid thereby the evil of
puniſhment; So <hi>Demas</hi> reſolving to ſleep in a whole
skin and not to be perſecuted for Chriſts ſake, forſook
St. <hi>Paul</hi> and imbraced the preſent world: now in
all theſe three reſpects, whether Sin be choſen under
the notion of good, by a miſtake, or that good may
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:61785:6"/>
come thereof, or that Danger be eſcaped by it; each
of theſe ſingle, and much more united, are a clear
demonſtration that Sin is not eligible for its ſelf. Sin
indeed is the worſt of any thing that is enemy to God
or man, it is very much worſe than Hell, not only
as its cauſe or parent, but conſidered in its ſelf; for
Hell is good for ſomething, even to glorifie God's
Juſtice, but Sin ſerves only to abuſe his grace and
goodneſs; Hell was of God's making, Sin of the
Devil's; Nay God made Hell as well to terrifie men
from coming there, as to puniſh the willful intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
into that place of torments: And hence the
chief end of Chriſts taking our fleſh, was to ſave us
from our ſins, (our worſt kind of enemies:) Hence
in Scripture when God is ſaid to be angry to the
higheſt pitch, the ſtile runs thus; <hi>I will give him up
that is filthy, to be filthy ſtill; I will chooſe your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions,
give them over to their iniquities;</hi> ſo that
were there no Hell, 'twere in this ſenſe a kind of
Damnation to be ſinners: Of all ſorts of puniſhments
ſin it ſelf is the greateſt, and ſo not the proper object
in its ſelf of a Rational mans, or true Chriſtians
choice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> As Sin is not to be choſen in and for its
ſelf, ſo neither with reſpect tothe Conſequences
thereof. The firſt and moſt immediate fruit of Sin is
ignorance, man was firſt tempted by the promiſe of
Knowledge, and fell into darkneſs by believing the
Devil holding forth his new lights; <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi>
knew what was good before the Devil promiſed them
the knowledge of evil, and had they not imbraced
this temptation they had continued in their happineſs:
This knowledge of evil was the introduction of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
the Underſtanding being baffled, the Will
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:61785:6"/>
became fooliſh, and both conſpired to ruine each
other; for the Will beginning to love Sin, the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
was ſet on work to commend and advance
it, and ſo became both Factious in approving their
new miſerable Purchaſe: for ever ſince <hi>Adam</hi> and
<hi>Eve</hi> yielded to the Tempter, who told them they
ſhould be as Gods in knowledge, Man hath a double
diſadvantage; for the Devil is hence grown more
quick-ſighted to abuſe us, and we the more blind by
his opening of our eyes, as is ſufficiently manifeſt by
the prevalence of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> in the world,
than which nothing can be more ridiculous, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
originally by the Fall of our firſt Parents from
their native paradiſe.</p>
            <p>A ſecond effect of Sin, is Shame, which is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
conſequence of all ſort of wickedneſs, <hi>what
fruit had you then in thoſe things whereof ye are now
aſhamed?</hi> Rom. 6. 21. We ſee the truth of this by
a too ſad Experience, what Arguments, what Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
what Neceſſity can perſwade men to confeſs their
ſins, how do men chuſe to involve Sin in excuſes and
denials, in the clouds of Lying and the white Linnen
of Hypocriſie, to ſhew that a mans ſpirit is ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed
and his face confounded when he is dreſſed of ſo
ſhameful Diſeaſe? It was the unhappy Patrimony
which our firſt Anceſtors bequeathed us, firſt to Sin,
and then to be aſhamed of our ſelves and Actions; <hi>The
woman which thou gaveſt me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Adam,</hi> charging
his ſin upon God; <hi>The Serpent beguiling me,</hi> ſaid <hi>Eve,</hi>
imputing it to the Devil, both betraying the naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of their Souls, as well as bodies, and proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
making Aprons of Excuſes as well as Leaves:
And you may read the Character of the Parents in
the Childrens foreheads, for Shame makes us as back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:61785:7"/>
to reveal our ſins as we are forward to confeſs
our Sickneſſes, and leſs deſirous to truſt God with
the diſeaſes of our Souls, than the Phyſician with
thoſe of our Bodies. None will own ſin amongſt all
its acquaintance. If a man purſue Vengeance he will
Chriſten it Juſtice; he that hates another mans per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
pretends enmity to his ſins, and the theft of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chell</hi>
ſhelters its ſelf under the modeſty of her ſex,
<hi>Geneſis</hi> 30. 34, 35. he that deſigns to play the
Devil, firſt perſonates the Saint, and Rebells call
themſelves the people of the Lord; thus Sacriledge
and Schiſm are a godly thorough Reformation; po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
Fury is Zeal; Obſtinacy againſt Laws, tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Conſcience; Treaſon and Nonſence, praying
by the Spirit; to dye in Rebellion, a glorious Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom;
and the madneſs of the Commons againſt
the King and the Prieſts, is courage in the cauſe of
the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; oppreſſion of our brethren
Subjects, calls its ſelf a High Court of Juſtice; and
ſuch as ſeize our Eſtates, were the Keepers of our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties;
and Doctors, Elders and Deacons, the only
Sceptre of Chriſt; and (to avoid Arbitrary Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)
we kneel at the bar of our fellow-Subjects,
and are impriſon'd for new unheard of Crimes, to
preſerve our Properties and Privileges: A clear Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
that Sin dares not appear in its own colours,
and that Shame is its never failing conſequence, and
ſo ineligible in both reſpects. <hi>Abſalon</hi>'s Rebellion
was covered over with a fit of Devotion; one <hi>Herod</hi>
murthers with worſhipping the bleſſed Babe, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Herod</hi> ſtrikes off the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> Head, to avoid
being perjur'd; <hi>Saul</hi> excuſed his ſin by bringing it to
the Altar, and the worſt of men (incarnate Devils)
of whom St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Timoth.</hi> 3. chap. from the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:61785:7"/>
2. to the 7. <hi>ver.</hi> had <hi>a form of godlineſs.</hi> Now were
Sin an eligible thing, the proper object of a rational
Choyce, what need were there of excuſes or denials,
after the commiſſion of any wickedneſs, or giving
it glorious, or borrowed titles to cover its deformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties?
And ſo Sin is not to be choſen, either for its ſelf,
or with reſpect to its immediate fruits or conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Sin is not the object of a rational Mans,
or true Chriſtians choice, becauſe every way oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to all Gods glorious Attributes, and his very Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Eſſence: If we conſider Gods ſovereignty,
Sin is Rebellion; if his Juſtice, it is Iniquity; if his
Goodneſs, ſin is Unkindneſs; If God's holineſs and
pureneſs, Sin is defilement: Conſider God's holineſs
as a Rule, Sin is a Tranſgreſſion; if as an Excellency,
Sin is Deformity: Thus it is contrary to the whole
nature of God, and ſtrikes at his Attributes and Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.
As God is every way in himſelf good, ſo
Sin is evil in its ſelf, and good in no reſpect; and as
God is to be loved for himſelf, becauſe the chiefeſt
good, ſo Sin is to hated for it ſelf. The holy Ghoſt
could not call it by a worſe name than its ſelf, as
<hi>Rom. 7. 13. Sin that it might appear ſin, and Sin
by the commandment appeared exceeding ſinful.</hi>
Again, God is the great reward of himſelf, and Sin
the puniſhment of its ſelf, (Dyametrically oppoſite.)
We are hereby enemies to God, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1. haters of
God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 30. Sin is contrary to the glory of
God eſſential, and manifeſtative; it denies the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
due to God, <hi>Rom. 1. 21. Titus</hi> 1. 16. deſpiſeth
and reproacheth his glory, and miſimployes it, by
giving it to men, to our ſelves, or to the Devil, (as
they who told our Saviour <hi>that he caſt out Devils by
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:61785:8"/>
Belzeebub.</hi>) Sin wrongs God in his very Nature and
Being, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. 1. every ſinner wiſheth there were
no God, and ſaith it in his heart (as <hi>David</hi> obſerveth.)
Upon each of theſe Heads I might inſiſt very largely,
but to avoid treſpaſſing on your patience, I paſs to
the following particulars.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Sin is the tranſgreſſion of God's Laws,
and ſo not the object of a Chriſtians Choice: In the
Law there is a Rectitude, every thing in God's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands
is juſt, and right, Sin is crookendneſs: the Law
teacheth wiſdom, Sin is folly, and the Wicked man
a fool, and both in Scripture (and very frequent in
the <hi>Proverbs</hi>) made convertible terms: God's
Commands are pure, Sin is filthineſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 12.
there is liberty in the Law, <hi>James</hi> 2. 8. Sin is
a bondage, 2 <hi>Timothy</hi> 2. 26. the keeping of the
Law brings a reward, but Sin ſhame and death,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 22, 23. but that which aggravates the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of Sin upon this account is, that it is the
tranſgreſſion of ſuch Laws as are not grievous.
1. Laws reaſonable and ſuitable to our nature, and
advantageous to our intereſt; 2. Such Laws as the
Author of which hath given us ſufficient power and
ſtrength (if not wanting to our ſelves) for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance;
3. Such Laws by obedience to which we
arrive at an Eternity of happineſs.</p>
            <p>1. The Laws of God (of which Sin is a tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion)
are reaſonable, ſuitable to our Nature, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous
to our Intereſt; <hi>He hath ſhewed thee
O Man, what is good, and what doth the Lord thy God
require of thee, but to doe Juſtice, and love Mercy, and
walk humbly with thy God?</hi> This is the ſumm of the
natural Law, that we behave our ſelves reverently
and obediently to the divine Majeſty, and juſtly and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:61785:8"/>
Charitably towards men; and for the better diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of both, to govern our ſelves in ſenſual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
with Temperance and Moderation; and what
is there grievous in all this? That we inwardly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
and love God, and expreſs it by external
worſhip and our readineſs to obey his will revealed,
teſtifie our dependance on him in all Dangers
and Wants, by offering up to him our conſtant
Prayers and Supplications, and acknowledge our
obligations by continual Praiſes and Thankſgivings
for all his mercies; to entertain of God no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy
thoughts, nor give to others that honour
and reverence, which is only ſutable to his Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and Perfections, carefully to avoid the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation
of his Name, and take heed of the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
and contempt of his Worſhip, or any thing
belonging to it; this is the firſt part of Natural
Religion, the generals of thoſe Duties which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
mans reaſon tells him he owes to God; and
here thus far there is nothing commanded but what
agrees very well with the reaſon of Mankind. As
for the ſix laſt precepts of the Decalogue relating
to the good order and government of our Selves,
with reſpect to our ſelves, Equals, Inferiours or
Superiours; theſe are ſuch Laws as tend to our own
peace, and the happineſs of humane Socieites, and
as expounded in Chriſt's Sermon on the Mount,
nothing more can be deviſed for the welfare of
Mankind, by ſweetning their Spirits, and allaying
their Paſſions and Animoſities.</p>
            <p>2. The Author of thoſe Laws (of which Sin is
the Tranſgreſſion) hath not left us deſtitute of
Strength or Power for performance; 'tis true, We
have Contracted a great deal of Weakneſs by our
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:61785:9"/>
wilful Degeneracy from goodneſs, but that grace
which the Goſpel offers to us for our Aſſiſtance,
is ſufficient for us; <hi>greater is he that is in us, than
he that is in the world,</hi> 1 John 4. 4. and if ſo, then
it clearly followeth, that ſuch as apply themſelves
ſeriouſly to Religion, and yield themſelves tracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to good Motions, will find the Spirit of God
more ready and active for their Incouragement,
than the Devil to pull them back; unleſs we think
God hath given a greater power and a larger
commiſſion to the Devil to doe us miſchief, than
to his holy Spirit and his holy Angels to doe us
good, which were Blaſphemy to aſſert, and the
calling in queſtion the goodneſs of God. Some
ſay we cannot keep the Commandments, and its
true, of our ſelves (as of our ſelves) we are not
able to think a good thought, much leſs to doe a
good work. (As of our ſelves. Note that) for the
ſame Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>I can doe all things through
Chriſt that ſtrengtheneth me,</hi> and theſe two muſt
be reconciled, we cannot, and we can keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments;
that is, we cannot of our ſelves, but
we can, <hi>through Chriſt that ſtrengthens us,</hi> and
whoſe grace is never wanting to us, unleſs we are
wanting to our ſelves: To ſay we cannot keep
the Commandments without adding Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s
Comment (as of our ſelves) I look upon as a Crude
poſition, incourageing Idleneſs, for God inqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
offers us an aſſiſtance equall to the difficulty
of his Commands, or elſe St. <hi>John</hi> was in an Error,
(which may not be ſuppoſed) when he tells us
that <hi>his Commandments are not grievous,</hi> (1 John
5. 3.) and grievous they muſt be, if Gods grace
(we being weak of our ſelves) be not ſufficient
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:61785:9"/>
for the performance in ſuch Evangelical meaſures
and degrees as God expects from us. <hi>I can doe all
things through Chriſt that ſtrengthens me,</hi> Philip.
4. 13. Obſerve here three things, 1. The ſtrength
of Chriſt is the original and fountain of all ours,
2. The ſtrength of a Chriſtian, derived from Chriſt,
hath a kind of Omnipotence, ſufficient for the
whole duty of Chriſtians, (<hi>it can doe all things.</hi>)
3. The ſtrength and power thus beſtowed, is the
work of a Chriſtian, (the man ſtrengthened by
Chriſt) <hi>I can doe all things:</hi> I <hi>Paul</hi> can (through
Chriſts ſtrength, and aſſiſted by grace) keep the
Commandments in the Goſpel ſenſe. If this be
not the Apoſtles meaning, I muſt even go to
School again to underſtand <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Through God
who ſtrengthens us, we are able to perform what
he is able to injoyn; we can ſuffer by his Patience,
what in his Wiſdom he can inſlict; chuſe, by his
direction what in his goodneſs he can propoſe.
In ſhort, we can believe his promiſes and doe his
will; we can reſiſt his enemy and drink his Cup;
but by his Wiſdom, and by his Grace, by his
Power, and by his Patience; and if <hi>Arminius</hi> ſay
more than this, or <hi>Calvin</hi> leſs, with ſubmiſſion to
better Judgments, the middle way between both
extreams, is certainly the ſafeſt, and proves God's
Commands, the only meaſure of our Obedience, not
to be Grievous; and conſequentially to chuſe Sin,
which is the tranſgreſſion of ſuch juſt and reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Laws, muſt be Irrational and Irreligious.</p>
            <p>3, That Law of which Sin is the Trangreſſion,
is ſuch a Law by obedience to which we attain
(<hi>through Chriſt</hi>) Eternal happineſs; and well did
<hi>David</hi> ſpeak upon this account, <hi>Thy Commands, O
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:61785:10"/>
God, are Righteous, and in keeping of them there
is great reward,</hi> Pſal. 19. 11. <hi>An exceeding Eternal
weight of Glory, ſuch as eye hath not ſeen, nor ear
heard, nor hath entred into the heart of man to
conceive,</hi> (as St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks) a happineſs that doth
ſilence invention, non-plus Hyperbolies, exceeds all
our Conceptions, and Imaginations, and the Orato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Men, or Angels. Now to chuſe Sin, which
is the tranſgreſſion of ſuch Laws as are ſuitable to
our Natures, advantageous both to our Temporal
and Eternal Intereſt; Laws, Holy, Good and
Juſt in themſelves, and not Grievous to us; to
chuſe Sin, which is oppoſite to ſuch Laws as
theſe, is the greateſt folly and madneſs, we here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
degrade our ſelves from our very Eſſences, and
bid defiance to our underſtanding (the candle of
the Lord in our own breaſts.)</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> As Sin is not eligible for its ſelf or
Conſequences, not with reſpect to Gods Attributes
and Eſſence, nor with reference to his Laws, ſo
not the object of a rational Choice, becauſe it is
deſtructive to our own Souls; As 1. to the purity
of the Soul, (Sin takes away its beauty.) 2. to its
Dignity, (ſo ſin caſts down the Soul from its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.)
3. to the Souls Liberty (Sin makes it
a Captive.) 4. to the ſtrength of the Soul, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.
30. <hi>Impotens libido,</hi> (Sin makes us weak, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent.)
5. to the peace of the Soul, (<hi>ubi pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum
ibi procella,) there is no peace</hi> (ſaith my God)
<hi>to the wicked;</hi> and Laſtly, to the ſafety and life
of the Soul, (2 <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 1. 9.) there are known To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pical
heads which may be inlarged upon in your
private Meditations. Sin is <hi>Expoliatio gratuitorum,</hi>
(ſay the Schools) a ſtripping of the Soul of all thoſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:61785:10"/>
ſupernatural Excellencies that God gave men when
created after his own image; and 'tis <hi>Vulneratio
Naturalium,</hi> Sin wounds the Soul as to its Naturals
and Morals, as well as Spirituals.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, Sin is the diſeaſe of our Souls, and no
rational man that knows what Health is, will chuſe
a ſickneſs, and be in love with a Diſeaſe: Sin is
as deſtructive of the Souls health, beauty and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as diſtemper'd Humours defect in any Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
Solution of Parts, or Diſlocation of a Joint
can be to the Body: An ignorant Mind is equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
to a blind Eye; a Will diſabled worſe than a
lame hand; and vile Affections more ugly than
deformed Members; an evil Conſcience is more
afflictive than a Cancer in the Breaſt; Pining En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,
more vexatious than the knawing of our Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs;
the furies of Luſt, Rage and Intemperance,
are as unnatural Diſtempers, as Feveriſh heats, and
the inſatiable deſire after Worldly Wealth; and
Greatneſs is an Hydropique thirſt; and hence in
Scripture the ſickneſſes and diſeaſes of our Bodies,
are uſed to repreſent thoſe of our Souls, which
he that attentively reads and meditates on, will
furniſh himſelf with many Inſtances of great uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
and advantage: our Firſt Parents got this
diſeaſe by eating of an Apple which the Devil had
poyſoned, and infected all their Poſterity with the
Venom of it; <hi>Adam</hi> fell in Paradiſe, and all his
Off-ſpring are <hi>Mephiboſeth</hi>'s line from their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
Womb. Sin now runs in a Blood, and flies
higher and higher inſtead of abating its firſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour,
'tis <hi>Morbus epacmaſticus, epidemicus &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagiouſus;</hi>
as Symptoms ſtill heighten, it is a catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and contagious Diſeaſe ſeizing upon thoſe that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:61785:11"/>
come near ſuch as are infected with it, <hi>Flee from
Sin</hi> (Eccleſiaſticus 21. 2.) <hi>as from the face of a
Serpent, for if thou comeſt near, it will bite thee,
the teeth thereof are as the teeth of a Lyon ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Sons of men;</hi> This was the poyſon that lay
under the teeth of the old Serpent the Devil, when
he bit our firſt Parents: Nay Sin is (<hi>Morbus com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitus</hi>)
ſo complicated a Diſeaſe, that all other
diſeaſes are indeed but the Symptomes of this:
Which brings me to the Sixth Particular, That Sin
is not only the Souls Sickneſs, but the ſourſe and
fountain of all the Maladies and Diſtempers that
happen to our Bodies, and ſo an enemy to Body
and Soul at once; and as ſo, not the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of our Election or Choice: Haſt thou a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>?

Ryot, and Debaucheries. Haſt thou a <gap reason="foreign">

—is thy Body turned black and ſallow,
and thy beauty faded? 'tis probably occaſioned by
a too great delight and content in admiring the
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:61785:11"/>
excellency of thy frail Complexion. Haſt thou a
Paralyſis? is the uſe of thy Limbs taken from thee?
'tis Sin is the cauſe; perhaps thy Hands have been
ſhut to the Poor, or thy Feet ſwift to ſhed Blood,
or to walk in the paths of ungodlineſs. Sin there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is not the object of a rational man's Choice,
becauſe it is the Souls Sickneſs and the ſourſe of
all bodily Diſtempers and Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seventhly,</hi> Sin is not a ſit Object to be elected,
becauſe it is the unhappy parent of Temporal,
Spiritual and Eternal Death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>By Sin, Death entred into the World,</hi> Rom. 5. 12.
Death is the Child of ſin, not of Nature; Nay, it
deſtroys our Souls as well as our Bodies, <hi>The Soul
that ſinneth ſhall dye;</hi> the death of Nature and the
death of Grace, Sin occaſion'd both; and not only
ſo, but the death that never dies is ſins Wages;
'tis Sin keeps in the fire of Hell to all Eternity,
that lays on thoſe everlaſting <hi>torments prepared for
the Devil and his Angels;</hi> 'tis ſin that not only feeds
the Worm with our Bodies, but the never-dying
worm with our Souls likewiſe; it kindles the
ſlames of Luſt here in our hearts, and blows the
coals in Hell to torment both our bodies and
ſouls to eternal Ages; and <hi>who can dwell with
everlaſting burnings?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, Sin is not the object of a rational Man,
or good Chriſtians Choice, if put in the ballance
with Afflictions, and that is the laſt Branch of the
<hi>Theſis,</hi> which I laid down at the beginning of my
Diſcourſe, occaſioned by <hi>Elihu's</hi> Reprehenſion of
<hi>Job,</hi> under the notion of chuſing wickedneſs rather
than ſufferings, and this I ſhall demonſtrate briefly
and plainly, and make Application to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:61785:12"/>
My Poſition is this, without any Equivocation;
it is the property of a good Man to chuſe the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Affliction before the leaſt Sin, or there is more
evil in one ſin, than in all whatſoever Suffering.
This appears in ten Particulars, 1. Sin ſeparates from
God, but Affliction not. 2. Affliction is not, Sin is
evil in its ſelf. 3. A ſinful ſtate cannot, but an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
may conſiſt with the love of God. 4. The
evil of Suffering is but momentany, of Sin everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting.
5. We are called to Suffering, commanded
by Chriſt to take up our Croſs, and to follow him,
but not called to ſin. 6. The end of Suffering is
glory, of Sin ſhame. 7. By ſuffering we loſe ſome
outward good, by Sin the ſoul. 8. Suffering ſpeaks
our conformity to Chriſt, Sin to the Devils. 9. God
is the Author of Affliction, not of Sin; Laſtly, Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
may be good if ſanctified to us, but not
Sins. I ſhall not obſerve a ſtrict order, as to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
one of theſe Heads, but ſingle out the chiefeſt
and moſt uſeful for a mixt Audience.</p>
            <p>1. To chuſe Affliction is a hard choice, for Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is not good in its ſelf, but however it may
be uſeful to us; <hi>happy is the man that endureth
temptations, and chaſtnings,</hi> the Scripture ſpeaks in
many places; but happy is the man that commits
Iniquity, hath not the patronage of one ſingle Text:
<hi>David</hi> could ſay upon tryal, Pſal. 119. 71. <hi>It is
good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might
learn thy Statutes;</hi> but he never ſaid, It is good for
me that I have ſinned, unlearned thy Precepts, or
broke thy Commandments: <hi>David</hi> pleaſed himſelf
in being afflicted, but not in thinking he had ſinned,
as is viſible enough in his ſeven Penitential <hi>Pſalms;</hi>
and particularly if we compare the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. chap.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:61785:12"/>
11. <hi>ver.</hi> with <hi>Pſalm</hi> 51. we ſhall find <hi>David</hi> reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his ſins. as the 1, 2, 3. greateſt puniſhment in
all the World; <hi>David</hi> did not firſt pray, that his
Houſe might be delivered from the fury of the
Sword, or that his Wives might not be violated
before his face, his Children might not be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bells;
the good man paſſed by theſe things as tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
and trivial puniſhments, but he cries upon
his Sins, his Sins, his Sins, three times in a breath,
<hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 1. as ſo many haunting Devils that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed
his reſt. When <hi>Paul,</hi> of a Perſecutor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a perſecuted Apoſtle, and was delivered from
his ſins, he was immediately ſo raviſhed with the
love of his deliverer, and the joy of his deliverance,
that he cared not to be delivered from any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
beſides; he even gloried in tribulation, as very
uſeful both to exerciſe and feed his patience, as
<hi>Rom. 5. 3. Acts</hi> 21. 13. he was <hi>ready, not to be bound
only, but dye for the Lord Jeſus.</hi> Sickneſs and Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
Baniſhment and Bonds, and every kind of
Perſecution, are heavy burthens to the Fleſh, but
light, being wighed in the ballance with the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
and miſeries of Sin and Wickedneſs; when
God the Father of Spirits afflicts his Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
he doth it that they may be partakers of his
Holineſs, as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 10, 11. but Sin is the ſting of
all afflictions, 'tis the ſuffering as Evil doers that
keeps men from being Martyrs, but they are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
who ſuffer in a good cauſe, <hi>for even hereunto
are ye called, becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us,
leaving us an example that we ſhould tread in his
ſteps who did no ſin, neither was guile found in his
lips. Moſes</hi> well underſtood himſelf when he <hi>choſe
rather to be afflicted with the people of God, than
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:61785:13"/>
enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon,</hi> Heb. 11. 25.
So the old Martyrs, Will you have a Priſon, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
your Saviour and your Lord? Will you burn
in this fire, or commit that Idolatrous Act? Will
you dye by a Halter, or forſake the Faith? Oh,
ſay they, give us Priſons, Fires, Axes, Gibbets,
Wheels, Lyons, all the Torments invented by Men
or Devils, rather than we will comply with Sin
and Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p>This is a Point neceſſary in all, but eſpecially
theſe Times, wherein men boaſt of a Zeal for
God, but not according to Knowledge; and ſeek
to avoid future poſſible Afflictions by preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful
Actions: As in the Duke of <hi>York</hi>'s Caſe, no
man that underſtands the Scriptures, and will not
ſuffer his Reaſon by paſſion to be ecclipſed, can
believe it lawful by Gods Laws, to bar any man
of his Right of Succeſſion to a Crown (of all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral
Rights, the greateſt) to avoid future proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Inconveniences, in Sacred and Civil Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations;
nor do I believe that any the framers of
this Bill would think it a piece of Juſtice to have
their Children (or in default of Iſſue) their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren
in the fleſh, thus debar'd of their Rights, for
different modes of Worſhip from what is now Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
Eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>That which is ſimply evil, may not for any
good be done; (the Caſe we are now upon) if Saint
<hi>Paul,</hi> or the Holy Ghoſt (ſpeaking by him) under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the Chriſtian Religion, 'tis not lawful to tell
an officious Lye for the glory of God, as <hi>Job</hi> 13. 7.
<hi>Will ye ſpeak wickedly for God? or talk deceitfully
for him?</hi> If not for the glory of God, then not
for an inferiour End, not for the ſaving of a Life,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:61785:13"/>
or the peace of a State. Nay, (as <hi>Anſelm, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi>
and others obſerve) we ſhould rather hazard
the Salvation of mankind than commit a ſin to
ſave it: If St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſay true, (and 'tis hard to ſay
he does not) Damnation is due to ſuch as do a
preſent evil, upon the proſpect of a future good,
<hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 8. Suppoſe there were Preſidents to juſtifie
a Bill of this nature by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> ſhall
humane Laws evacuate the Laws of God? How
often hath <hi>Jack-Presbyter</hi> (the framer of that Bill)
pleaded that God muſt be obeyed rather than
man, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Let him ſtand to his own Argument, or
give a Reaſon for the why not? 'tis ſtrange to
me, that men calling themſelves <hi>Proteſtants</hi>—can
be guilty of ſuch Votes as theſe, which are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned
by the true Proteſtant Religion by Law
eſtabliſhed in this beſt of Reformed Churches. I
am neither <hi>Papiſt</hi> nor Popiſhly affected, but I aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
a true Proteſtant Principle founded on Holy
Writ, that Sin is not to be elected if there be no
other expedient left to avoid being Perſecuted:
As for the diſtinction which ſome make, that we
may not do evil that good may come, that is not
for a private good end, but we may for a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
benefit; I have not ſo learned Chriſt, I thank
God, and I deſie the Jeſuitical, and Presbyterian
Brotherhood, to give me one Scripture Text, or
any one ſound Reaſon to juſtifie that Diſtinction
aforeſaid; and till that be done, let the lawful Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
be Zealot for the intereſt either of Kirk, or
Conclave; as I will not reade Maſs, nor ſwallow
the Covenant, ſo I will not Rebell againſt the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance
of God, but leave God to govern his own
World, <hi>Who reſtrains the ſpirit of Princes, and is
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:61785:14"/>
wonderful among the Kings of the earth.</hi> God, <hi>who
turns the hearts of Kings as the rivers of Water, as
it pleaſeth himſelf:</hi> the God <hi>who remembers mercy
in his wrath, and puniſheth leſs than our ſins deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved;</hi>
and this was the judgment and practice of the
Saints and Churches Apoſtolically Primitive. A Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſian
Maſacre, a Guiſcan League, a Powder Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
a Covenant Reformation, a Spaniſh Inquiſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Houſe, and an Engliſh High Court of Juſtice,
the fighting for Reformation, and bidding Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to Heaven, <hi>by whom Kings reign;</hi> theſe are
Abominations ſo ſcandalous and Antichriſtian, as
do non-plus Hyperbolies, and ſilence Invention;
and next to theſe there is ſcarce any thing more
Criminal than the equally ſinful and ridiculous
Bill againſt the Succeſſion of his Royal Highneſs,
(in caſe he ſurvive the King) to the Crown and
Sceptre of this Nation. I wiſh the King may out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
his Brother, and put a Period to this Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
but I believe the framers of that Bill had a
farther Deſign than the Dukes perſon, and am
clearly of opinion, that there is both a Popiſh Plot,
and a Presbyterian one at this time againſt the
Church, or the King, or both in Conjunction, and
hath been more or leſs ſo, ever ſince the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
and I am heartily ſorry, that ſince Papiſts and
Presbyterians call themſelves <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> that by
their Seditious Principles and Actions, they ſhould
rather ſeem Proſelytes to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> (the Victorious)
than to the Humble, Innocent and Perſecuted <hi>Jeſus;</hi>
and yet that the latter Saints ſhould be ſo far inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of this, as to call all that will not concur with
them in their actions, Tantyvies, and Tories, and
French Penſioners, is very inſolently Ridiculous.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:61785:14"/>
            <p>2. Afflictions are the Exerciſes of our Graces, as
Faith, Patience, Humility, and Charity, in which
<hi>Chriſt</hi> in his life (<hi>who was a man of Sorrows and
acquainted with Griefs</hi>) was pleaſed to be exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary
to us, and we ſhould and ought <hi>to look up
to this Jeſus who endured the Croſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2.
'tis an excellent Expreſſion of <hi>Charles</hi> the Martyr
to his Son, (our Sovereign) this advantage you have
above other Princes, that you have begun, and
now ſpent ſome years in the experience of Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and exerciſe of Patience, wherein Piety, and
all Vertues are commonly better planted to a thri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving,
as Trees ſet in Winter, than in the warmth and
ſerenity of Times: He gives inſtance in <hi>David</hi> and
<hi>Rehoboam,</hi> the one prepared by many Afflictions for
a flouriſhing Kingdom, the other unſoftned by the
unparallel'd proſperity of the Court of <hi>Solomon;</hi> and
this is indeed the great advantage of Afflictions above
earthly Greatneſs, that this laſt makes us Proud, and
Inſolent, and to ſay, <hi>who is the Lord?</hi> and by the
other our graces are exerciſed and increaſed; <hi>Ye have
heard of the patience of Job,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James,</hi> but we
had never heard of any ſuch thing but for his afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and we have heard of <hi>Job,</hi> ſaith, <hi>though he kill me,
yet will I truſt in him;</hi> but this was the fruit of his
patience in ſuffering. St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Charity had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
been upon Record for our imitation, but for his
Perſecution. Had the old Army of Martyrs took
up Arms againſt their Emperors (being Heathens)
inſtead of being Patient, and Charitable, and Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
and Meek, like men that underſtood Chriſt's
Religion, they had neither been Preſidents to us, nor
found for themſelves a place in Heaven. The aſſaults
of Affliction may be terrible, like <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s Lyon,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:61785:15"/>
but they yield much ſweetneſs to thoſe, who can
encounter, and overcome; who know how to out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>live
the witherings of their Gourds, without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content
or Peeviſhneſs whilſt they may yet converſe
with God, as the Royal Martyr <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt,
rarely expreſſeth it.</p>
            <p>3. Afflictions wean us from the World, and bring
us nearer to God, and Sin makes us earthly minded,
and makes a ſeparation between God and us: The
ſufferings of the Saints are the ſumm of Chriſtian
Philoſophy, they are ſent to wean us from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities
and affections of this World, and create in us
ſtrong deſires after Heaven, whilſt God here treates
us rudely, that we may long to be in our Country,
where God ſhall be our Portion, and Angels our
Companions, and Chriſt our perpetual Feaſt, and
never ceaſing Joy the entertainment of all injured
and patient Sufferers. Oh Death! how bitter art
thou to a man that is at eaſe and reſt in his Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons?
but he that is uneaſy in his Body, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet
in his Fortunes, vexed in his Perſon, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compos'd
in his Deſigns, who here finds no pleaſure
or reſt, he will be glad and rejoice to fix his heart
where he ſhall have the full of his deſires, and what
can only make him partaker of real Happineſs. As
long as the waters of Perſecution are upon the earth,
(the Alluſion is pardonable I conceive) ſo long we
dwell in the Ark, but where the Land is dry, the
Dove its ſelf will be tempted to a wandring courſe
of life, and never return to her houſe of ſafety; this
bleſſed effect afflictions had upon <hi>Job,</hi> in making him
bid adieu to the World, <hi>Naked came I out of my
mothers womb, and naked ſhall I return thither,</hi> &amp;c.
and the ſame effect Affliction wrought in the late
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:61785:15"/>
Martyr'd King of <hi>England</hi> (who as he imitated the
Piety, ſo he had the troubles of <hi>David</hi> (I ſhall not
want (ſaith he) the heavy and envyed Crowns of
this World, when my God hath mercifully crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and conſummated his Graces with glory, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chang'd
the ſhadows of my earthly Kingdoms among
men, for the ſubſtance of that heavenly Kingdom
with himſelf. Thus Afflictions wean us from the
World and bring us nearer to God, but Sin and the
World, are a Kin, and of a blood, and Sin is a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from God; the Lord ſaith to ſinners, <hi>you are
departed and gone, your iniquities have ſeparated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
you and your God,</hi> as the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
it.</p>
            <p>4. We are full of Worldly mindedneſs, <hi>adhaeſit
pavimento,</hi> as <hi>David</hi> ſpake; but in another ſenſe,
<hi>our ſoul cleaveth to the duſt:</hi> we all complain the
World is naught, and ſo it is, <hi>the whole World lyeth
in wickedneſs,</hi> and yet as bad as it is, it finds an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
in our hearts proportionably to our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Proſperities; the faſter Riches, and Honours,
and other Vanities increaſe, the more eagerly we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
and dote on theſe Tranſitory things. 'Tis Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction
that takes off their ſeeming pleaſantneſs, and
imbitters the luſciouſneſs of them to our taſte; that
we have any apprehenſion at all of the Vanity of
the World, is due to thoſe vexations of Spirit, that
are interwoven with it.</p>
            <p>5. To be innocent and to be Afflicted, is the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and ſoul of Chriſtianity its ſelf; <hi>I John your Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and partaker of tribulation, and in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and patience of Jeſus,</hi> ſaid good St. <hi>John.</hi> Theſe
were the Titles and Ornaments of his profeſſion,
that is to ſay, I <hi>John</hi> your fellow Chriſtian, for the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:61785:16"/>
former deſcant this is the plain Song. Love is the
Soul of Chriſtianity, and the ſoul of Love is Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
God hath given a ſingle Bleſſing to other gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
but a double to this; it is a double kindneſs we
receive at Gods hands, firſt to be Innocent, and then
to be perſecuted with Jeſus Chriſt. The Church is
like <hi>Moſes</hi> his Buſh, when it is all on fire it is not
at all conſumed, but made full of Miracle, full of
Splendor, and full of God; and unleſs we can find
ſomething that God cannot turn into Joy, if he ſo
pleaſe, we have reaſon, not only with the well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed
Heathens, to be patient under, but (with
St. <hi>Paul</hi>) to rejoice exceedingly in Tribulation, not
to think a Fiery Tryal ſtrange, but rejoice that we
are partakers of Chriſts Sufferings; as St. <hi>Peter
(Paul</hi>'s beloved Brother and our fellow Souldier under
the banner of the Croſs,) exhorts us, and proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
his brother <hi>James, My Brethren, Count it all joy
when ye fall into divers Temptations.</hi> Take the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,
ſaith St. <hi>James,</hi> as an example of Suffering
Afflictions; but Jeſus Chriſt is beyond all theſe, for
<hi>he ſuffered for us, leaving us an example that we ſhould
follow his ſteps.</hi> Theſe things conſidered, is it not
a barbarous thing, for a grave Society of men to preſs
their Sovereign wholly to lay aſide the Rightful
Succeſſor of his Crown, by the Laws of Heaven,
which is the doing evil, to commit a known Sin,
to ſecure thereby the Proteſtant Religion, that is,
(that good may thence come) or rather that the
Zeal-drunk Presbyterian, who prefers Rebellion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Martyrdom, may not run the hazard of ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf no Chriſtian, by remonſtrating againſt
ſuffering Perſecution? A Papiſt cannot be a worſe
King than a <hi>Nero,</hi> or <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> and when St. <hi>Paul</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:61785:16"/>
ſaid we ſhould ſtand to our Faith, to imagine he intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
we ſhould ſtand to our Arms, is a new and ſtrange
Interpretation. But the Miſchief is deeper yet, for
we cannot Diſinherit this Gentleman but by a known
Principle of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> That Grace gives a
a title to Dominion, and accordingly the Pope diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
of an Heretick Kingdom, and barrs the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor,
and gives it to another Man of his own no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
and to the next of the Line, if he be of
the Romiſh Perſwaſion: and with what Conſcience
can theſe men (<hi>mutatis mutandis</hi>) preſs the King to
an imitation of the Pope of <hi>Rome,</hi> whilſt they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
in this very point his unjuſt Uſurpation? When
St. <hi>Paul</hi> preached Obedience to the Higher Powers,
and the Primitive Chriſtians prayed that the Father
might be ſucceeded by the Son, or the next of the
Blood, and Line; could they be ſuppoſed to mean
unleſs he were of this or that Religion, and then it
ſhould be lawful to Diſinherit them? He that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
ſuch a point in a Parliamentary Seſſion, and at
the ſame time calls himſelf a Chriſtian, is not ſo well
qualified for <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> as <hi>Bedlam.</hi> The Doctrine
of taking away the Right of Succeſſion came from
<hi>Rome,</hi> the Pope had it from the Devil without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion,
for St. <hi>Peter</hi> his pretended Predeceſſor, taught
no ſuch thing, but quite contrary exhorts all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians
(and ſo includes the Presbyterian) to endure
the Fiery Tryal, and rejoyce in being partakers of
Chriſts ſufferings; now Chriſt came to give us an
Heavenly, not to take away any mans earthly
Crown, and accordingly, as he knew no Sin, ſo
he underwent all ſorts of Affliction. He that ſaith
I will not have this man to Reign, becauſe a Papiſt,
or a Puritan; or ſaith, this is the Heir, let us by all
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:61785:17"/>
means bar him of Poſſeſſion, is a much worſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
than he that ſaith, <hi>It is the Lord, let him doe
as it pleaſeth him,</hi> I will bear his Indignation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
I have ſinned againſt him; This is the preſent
Queſtion under debate, with reference to the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion,
and not the Fighter for Reformation, but
the Patient under God's Correction, is the beſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender
of Chriſt Religion, I can, and will prove
againſt all the Papiſts and Sectaries in Chriſtendom.
I ask the Presbyterian theſe Queſtions, and requeſt
an Anſwer to them. 1. Doth the wrath of man
work the Righteouſneſs of God? 2. Doth the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
of the World (who came to ſave us from
Sin, not from Affliction) ſtand in need of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
man to promote his Religion, or the Intereſt
of his Kingdom? 3. Did <hi>Chriſt</hi> teach us by his
Example or Doctrine, to prefer Rebellion before
Martyrdom, and is not the contrary Poſition e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual
to a Mathematical Demonſtration? 4. Can
the Pope in <hi>Cathedra,</hi> or Pope <hi>Populus</hi> in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
by voting Evil good, and Good evil, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie
an unlawful action done with a good inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
If theſe things be ſo, I require him to prove
it, if not, St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Doctrine will be found <hi>Billa
vera</hi> in the Court of Heaven, That we may not
commit a preſent known Sin to avoid a future pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
Perſecution, all the Bills, Votes and Reſolves
of Froward men to the contrary notwithſtanding.
I underſtand not the over-looking the lawfulneſs to
paſs to the expedience of the thing, for <hi>Strafford</hi> loſt
his Head to pleaſe the Faction, and then it was
Voted on again, by making it no Preſident for the
Peers of the Kingdom. Suppoſe it be his Majeſties
judgement, and perſwaſion (as he hath declared)
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:61785:17"/>
that he cannot give conſent to the Bill of Excluſion;
Is it either Religion or good Manners (my Brethren)
to perſwade our lawful Sovereign againſt St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s
advice (which the Presbyterians quote ſometimes to
ſerve their own Intereſt and Turn) <hi>Whatſoever is
not of Faith is Sin?</hi> Have not Princes Conſciences as
well as other men, and may they not as well plead
their <hi>Judicium diſcretionis,</hi> who are only reſponſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to the God of Heaven, as any private perſon,
who is, and ought to be accountable both to God
and Man. Is it not ſufficient for his Majeſty to ſay
(what his Father Exemplified) better one Man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly
periſh, than the People be diſpleaſed, is a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious
Maxim, eſpecially conſidering the late King's
concluſion hereupon; I ſee it a bad exchange to
wound a mans own Conſcience, thereby to ſalve State
ſores, to calm the ſtorms of Popular Diſcontents,
by ſtirring up a Tempeſt in a mans own boſome. I
hope the Commons of <hi>England</hi> will never arrive to
that Inſolence, as to anſwer with <hi>Bradſhaw</hi> to their
Sovereign, your Reaſons, Sir, are not to be heard
againſt the Supream Juriſdiction of this Nation; and
yet they have lately huſſ'd their Brethren, and made
them do Penance for being Jury-men, and pay exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
Fees for no crime, under the notion of Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of Petitioning. And now we are upon the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioning
point, I remember a paſſage in Mr. <hi>Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies</hi>
Sermon Preached in 1645. at <hi>Michael Baſing-Shaw
London,</hi> to the Lord Mayor, and his Brethren,
when the Solemn League and Covenant was Renued
with Prayer and Faſting.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>You have (ſaith</hi> Holderforth) <hi>ſhot one Arrow al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready,
ſhoot another, and if that miſcarry, ſhoot ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
He that cuts down a Tree, though he cut it not
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:61785:18"/>
down at the firſt or ſecond blow, yet the firſt and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
blow, prepare to the ſpeeding blow that cuts it
down: You have delivered one Petition, deliver ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
if that miſcarry deliver another, the ſpeeding
Petition will come at laſt.</hi> That is in plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
Worry out your Prince with perpetual Noiſe and
Clamours, give him no reſt till he ſubmit to your
Requeſts. What this Fellow Preached in 1645.
hath been practiſed for two years paſt, yet muſt not
I ſay ſo, during the ſitting of the Commons, for fear of
a Reprimand in ſuch language as was never given a
Prieſt by Imperial Princes. But I bleſs God, I have
the ſpirit of an Engliſh man, and my Knees, due to
God and the King, ſhall never be yielded up to Uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
come what will, come Hanging, Burning, or
any other, or all the Torments that exerciſed the
Patience of the Primitive Chriſtians, and herein I
ſhew my ſelf a Proteſtant, whoſe great Principle it
is, rather than Sin, to chuſe Affliction.</p>
