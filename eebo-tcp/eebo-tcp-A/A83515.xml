            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Firſt, the Sectaries in writing Books againſt the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Presbyterians, have not ſpared to write againſt, and that in a moſt reproachfull and vild way, whole bodies, Aſſemblies, Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, and thoſe the higheſt and greateſt, as the Houſe of Peers, Houſe of Commons, the City of</hi> London <hi>and Common-Councell, the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the Kingdome and Generall Aſſembly of</hi> Scotland, <hi>ſome ſcores of ſuch Books written by Sectaries being in all mens hands; whereas in my writing againſt Sectaries, I have ſpoken only againſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons, but to whole Bodies and Societies I have tendred all due reſpect, vindicating them and their power againſt the Pamphlets and aſperſions of Sectaries. Secondly, the Sectaries in their writings of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact have not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> only named ordinary perſons, but perſons of the greateſt quality and place, abuſing them by name, as divers Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of both Houſes, the Speakers of both Houſes, ſome of the Lords and ſome of the Commons, the Lord Major of</hi> London <hi>by name, but I have all along declined the naming of perſons in authority and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracie,</hi> viz. <hi>in that way. Thirdly, the Sectaries in their perſonall matters and ſtories of the Presbyterians have ſtill related things ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly untrue, of which there hath been no ground at all, as Maſter</hi> Price'<hi>s ſtory of Maſter</hi> Bellamie <hi>

<pb facs="tcp:113943:4"/>
                  <hi>of the new Lord Major known to be untrue; and ſo I could go on with inſtancing in paſſages in Maſter</hi> Saltmarſh, Lilburne, <hi>and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch Books, manifeſtly untrue; and indeed of all the ſtories and matters of fact the Sectaries have in their Pamphlets in diſgrace of the Presbyterians, I hardly know one true one, whereas the ſtories re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by me of them, the moſt of them are knowne to many, and are certain, and I have beene all along carefull, as by my</hi> Reply <hi>to</hi> Cretenſis <hi>is evident. Fourthly, the Sectaries in their matters of fact have fallen upon Preſbyterians with old matters many yeeres ago, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Presbyterians, yea gone back as farre almoſt as to their childhood, as Maſter</hi> Price <hi>did to Maſter</hi> Bellamie, <hi>and Maſter</hi> Burton <hi>goes back to</hi> Bury <hi>ten yeeres before, to finde ſomething againſt Maſter</hi> Calamie, <hi>and ſo I might inſtance in others, but I have confined my ſelfe within three or foure yeeres, and to the times ſince they were Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries. Fifthly, the Sectaries have brought in againſt Preſbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans matters of bodily infirmities, of their complexions and ſuch like, as</hi> Saltmarſh <hi>in his pretended Anſwer to my Second Part of</hi> Gangrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, <hi>upbraids me, ſaying,</hi> Your face and complexion ſhowes a moſt ſadly parched, burnt, and withered ſpirit, <hi>but I have forborne that, leaſt I ſhould reproach my Maker, for he that made me made them. Sixthly, many of the Sectaries in their writings againſt the Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, the Aſſembly, godly Miniſters, the Scots, and particular perſons by name, have done it in the moſt ſcornfull, prophane, blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and abuſive way, even to the abuſing of the Scriptures, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, Proaching, Prayer, and other Ordinances, as ever was heard of in any age, witneſſe</hi> The Arraignment of Perſecution, Martins Eccho, Cretenſis, <hi>and divers others, but in my Diſcoveries of the Errors, Hereſies, Practiſes of the Sectaries, I have ſhunned all ſuch wayes, ſetting my ſelfe plainly to diſcover the Errors and abominable Practiſes, confuting them with Scriptures and Reaſon, and in a ſerious ſad manner applying the danger of thoſe evils to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of all, both Preſbyterians and Sectaries; and thus much for removing that ſtone of offence out of the way, taken from the manner and way of writing.</hi>

               <p>2. <hi>For the matter of this Booke that there's a Truth in the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Stories, Practices related in it, notwithſtanding the clamours and ſpeeches of the Sectaries, that they are lyes, all lyes, I deſire the Reader to obſerve and remember theſe following particulars: 1. That
<pb facs="tcp:113943:5"/>
the Sectaries of our time are ſo ſhameleſſe in this kind, as to ſay all things written againſt them, are lyes: thus they have ſaid the ſtories of the old Anabaptiſts in</hi> Germany <hi>written by</hi> Sleydan, Bullinger, Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus Hortenſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

                  </gap>s <hi>&amp; other worthy men were lyes, and they would not beleeve them; ſo Maſter</hi> Saltmarſh <hi>in one of his Pamphlets againſt Maſter</hi> Ley <hi>denies the truth of thoſe ſtories, and other Sectaries in Pamphlets before him have ſaid the ſame, affirming if the King had over-come the Parliament, ſtories would have made them as bad as the Anabaptiſts, and the Princes of</hi> Germany <hi>prevailing againſt them, ſet men on work to ſet them out ſo, but all was falſe; Now if our Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries will ſpeak and write thus of all the relations of the old Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, how can it be expected, but that they will cry all downe for falſe written of themſelves? So our Sectaries will not beleive the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Antinomians, Anabaptiſts, Familiſts in</hi> New England, <hi>of Miſtris</hi> Huchinſon <hi>and the reſt, but ſay all is falſe, all lyes; and ſome of them have cryed out of Maſter</hi> Wells <hi>his Booke of the Antinomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of</hi> New England, <hi>as much as of mine. 2. The truth of the maine ſubſtance and matter of this Booke both for opinions and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of fact is in the Booke it ſelfe, by quoting Books knowne to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds, by naming of perſons knowne for witneſſes, by relating of things common in the times, and theſe ſet by the Errors in the Margents, or joyned to the matter, ſo manifeſt that he that runs may read it, and rationally there can be no more queſtion made of them, then whether the</hi> Scots <hi>tooke</hi> New-Caſtle, <hi>the Parliaments Forces had a Victory at</hi> Nazeby <hi>Feild, there be ſuch a man as M.</hi> Hugh Peters <hi>or</hi> John Lilburn. 3. <hi>That the Sectaries have uſed devices and found out inventions on purpoſe to poſſeſſe people that relations of things in my Books are falſe, when moſt true; as for inſtance, ſome Sectaries that have been of the ſame name of thoſe Sectaries that I have related ſtories of (though they could not but know by many circumſtances and particulars in the ſtories they were not the men but others) have ſaid, Ther's a ſtory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated of me, I am the man he ſpeaks of, and tis all falſe, for I was at ſuch a place then and could not do ſo: thus one</hi> Webb <hi>an Officer in the Army did, telling the people in the Weſt where he found</hi> Gangraena, <hi>that the ſtory of</hi> Webb <hi>was of him, I am that</hi> Webb <hi>in</hi> Gangraena, <hi>and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb facs="tcp:113943:5"/>
in the Army ſpeak thus to the people to poſſeſſe them againſt</hi> Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graena; <hi>Now I writ not of that</hi> Webb, <hi>but another</hi> Webb <hi>a younger man here in</hi> London, <hi>not one of the Army, who put out a Booke for the vindication of himſelfe, where he confeſſes moſt of the things; and this other</hi> Webb <hi>could not but by many paſſages related, as of the age, as of being a Schoole-Maſter, as of the Chriſtian name, and divers others but know well enough I meant him not, and yet by this did he labour to blaſt my Book. Again ſome who having beene mentioned in Letters written up to friends, and printed by me, have come to my houſe, denying peremptorily thoſe things ſpoken of them in the Letters, deſiring to know who writ them that they might have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>e Anſwers, that thoſe things were moſt true, and they would make them good when ever they ſhould queſtion them, in which kind I could give divers notable inſtances, but the nature of a Preface not admitting many, I will relate only one, namely of Maſter</hi> Maſcall <hi>of</hi> Dover <hi>ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in a Letter ſent from</hi> Dover <hi>ſubſcribed by five hands to a Member of the Aſſembly, printed in the Second Part of</hi> Gangraena <hi>in</hi> p. 135. <hi>of the Second Edition, who preſently after the coming forth of that Book, coming to my houſe with a friend of his and mine for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, denyed poſitively and peremptorily what was written of him in the Letter, declaring he was of another judgement then to ſpeak ſo of our Miniſters and Synods as is expreſſed in that Letter, holding our godly Miniſters to have a lawfull calling, and Synods to be needfull; wherupon I writing to one of the Miniſters all paſſages that paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene us, and deſiring to know what he ſaid to it, he ſent me this Anſwer;</hi>

                     <hi>Worthy Sir, I received your Letter dated</hi> June <hi>the 18. but could not conveniently Anſwer it till now, becauſe I would ſee the carriages of the Independents on laſt wedneſday when we choſe our Elders. What we wrote of Maſter</hi> Maſcall <hi>we can cleare, and will maintaine and much more; and according to your advice you ſhall not faile of ſufficient teſtimony if that Letter be croſſed: whereas he ſaith that he holds our godly Miniſters to have a lawfull calling, he will not ſay it in</hi> Dover, <hi>till he have diſtinguiſhed the word godly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſhadow: For his ſaying they never kept Church-meetings in time of the publicke exerciſes, its a very falſe untruth, and for his ſeeming to accord with us in our account of Synods, he knows that we
<pb facs="tcp:113943:6"/>
hold it a duty to combine Churches, and to have a combination rule the Elders and Paſtor of a Congregation, which we know they will never allow. Thus much in breife for Maſter</hi> Maſcall <hi>who I dare ſay will not challenge any man in</hi> Dover, <hi>for that that is done againſt him, or if he doth, will find as ready an Anſwer as ever man received by man.</hi>

I do here declare and profeſſe againſt any ſuch miſconſtructions, or conſequences, it being not my intent to reflect either upon both Houſes as conjunct, or upon each as conſidered diſtinct, or upon the Committees of either Houſe, the moſt that can be drawne is, that ſome paſſages in Letters or Relations ſhow there are ſome particular Members that are or favor Sectaries, which in writing ſo much of the Sectaries (as I do) for the good of the Parliament and the Kingdome cannot poſſibly be avoided, (though I forbear the naming of, or deciphering any of them) and that there are ſome ſuch crept into the Parliament all the Kingdome knowes and ſpeaks of it, and therefore I meddle not to ſpeake againſt the Houſes in all my Diſcourſe, neither do I inſinuate any thing in the leaſt to bring the people out of love with Parliaments, or this Parliament: I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally declare, leaſt any ſhould miſtake, tis the peoples great intereſt and bleſſing to have the power and Priviledges of Parliament main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and they muſt take heed they be not ſo diſcontented with miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages of any particular Members or Committees that may fall out, as to ſet looſe in their hearts from Parliaments and deſert them.

About thirteene years a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go at</hi> Magnus <hi>Church I preaching againſt forſaking the Publick Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, had on a Lecture night at the ſame Church a Bill given me up (among the Bills to pray for the ſick) ſpeaking bitterly for ſo doing. At</hi> Hartford <hi>about 10. years ago, when Independency and the Church way began to be fallen too by ſome men of Note and ſome people to look after it, I preached againſt it earely, and by all wayes laboured to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the people. About 8. yeares agoe when Errors on the right hand tooke with many, I did at a Lecture in the City at</hi> Alderman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, <hi>and</hi> Coleman-ſtreet <hi>preach againſt Apoſtaſie and falling to Errors on the right hand, and more particularly at</hi> Coleman-ſtreet, <hi>(many in that pariſh being then leaning that way) gave ſome conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations againſt Errors on the right hand, and warned the people of the white Devill, quoting a ſaying of Maſter</hi> Cartwright <hi>out of the Proverbs, and Maſter</hi> Brightman <hi>out of the Revelations againſt lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Church of</hi> England, <hi>and Maſter</hi> John Goodwin <hi>was then well pleaſed with my Sermon that he gave mo great thanks. 2.

And indeed inſtead of any Miniſters or people oppoſing the Sectaries out of Policy, worldly In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts, tis evident tis the high way to ſome gainfull Place or other to become a Sectarie or to favour them, hundreds turning Independents and Sectaries meerly for preferments and Places, as heretofore men
<pb facs="tcp:113943:11"/>
turned Prelatical, and Arminians becauſe of great Livings; and how the Independent party have feathered their neſts, got well for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves above other men, the Reader ſhall find more ſpoken of it in this Book. 7. As for that which is ſaid I write ſo againſt the Sectaries out of a ſpirit of perſecution and hatred of peaceable conſciencious men, I can ſay truly, if I perſecute conſciencious peaceable men, whom do I then love? my love, delight and intereſt is in ſuch, and I am ſo far from a ſpirit of perſecution, that I would be glad but to find the ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure from Independents, Browniſts, Anabaptiſts and others, which I would meaſure unto them if it were in my power, namely I would not impriſon, baniſh them and ſuch like, only hinder them from all places of power and truſt in the Kingdome, and from ſpreading their Errors and Opinions to the hurting of others, keep the unſound from the ſound, which if I differed in judgement from what was eſtabliſhed in a Church, and had nothing elſe done to me, I ſhould never conplaine of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and violence for that; for tis abſolutely neceſſary for the peace and welfare of the civill State, beſides what tis for the honor of God, in the preventing the ſpreading of all Errors and Hereſies. And for a concluſion of this</hi> I <hi>have the clear and full teſtimony of my conſcience, that my appearing againſt the Sectaries hath not riſen from any ſuch baſe and poore grounds as the Sectaries alledge, but from a ſenſe of my duty that</hi> I <hi>might witneſſe to the truth of God in this ſinfull and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous generation.

boaſting what they had done, and how narrowly the Prieſt eſcaped them, and what they would have done if they had gotten him, and there was a great deale of applauding them by their fellowes who were there. The conſtant courſe of that Troop whilſt they quartered in that Town was to ſpeak againſt the Miniſtrie, calling them Prieſts, diſſwading the people from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Church; hardly three of a hundred of that Troop would goe to Church, they would tell the people that they would give them a Book ſhould do them more good then all the Sermons they ſhould ever hear in all their lives from all the Prieſts; and that they could preach better then the Miniſters of <hi>England;</hi> and this Company of Sectarians was ſo rude, that they did more hurt to a fine Dove-houſe of Baron <hi>Trevars,</hi> which this <hi>John Mathews</hi> was to look to, then Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and all his ſouldiers when they quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered there: This <hi>John Mathews</hi> intreated them they would not make ſuch ſpoyle and waſt, killing old as well as young without diſtinction; and he prevailed with their Captaine to go to them to forbid them, but they anſwered him that pigions were ſoules of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the aire given to the ſons of men, and all men had a common right in them that could get them, and they were as much theirs as the Barons, and therefore they would kill them, take their liberty, and not part from their right; upon which words the Captaine ſaid he was ſo convinced with their arguments, that he could not anſwer them, and ſo came away letting them do as they would. At ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time there being Poultrie provided by the good woman of the houſe for their diet, which ſhe killed with wringing their neeks about (as the cuſtome of the Country is) theſe ſouldiers would not have them dreſſed, but threw them away, and fecht others, cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their heads, for they would not eate things ſtrangled; and ſuch was the carriage of theſe Sectaries, that though <hi>John Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thewes</hi> be a man well affected to the Parliament, and well diſpoſed, yet he profeſſed he had rather have Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> and his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to quarter there, then that Troop of Captaine <hi>P.</hi>

I can produce both the names, and I think ſufficient witneſſe (people are affraid almoſt to ſpeak againſt the ſouldiers) that they have ſeriouſly ſpoken (as being their judgements and purpoſes) that if the ſouldiers knew the Countries minds, as the Country might know the ſouldiers, they would have another kind of Reformation then this Parliament is about. That they have not ſo long ſought for liberty, and now to be inſlaved; That they could goe all <hi>England</hi> through by force of <note place="margin">☜</note> Arms if they liſted. That the Country might call the Parliament to account for what they had done, for they were ſet up by them. They commonly in deriſion call our Brethren <hi>Jack Sect,</hi> and ſay they plot with the King againſt the Parliament; but if there were any occaſion of drawing the ſword againſt them, they would be <note place="margin">☜</note> more fierce againſt them, then ever againſt the Cavaleirs. They upon long diſpure with me cominued in this that there is no ſuch office as the Miniſtry; and it's blaſphemy for any one to ſay that he is a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt more then any other man; ſuch an office was, but it ceaſed. A Captaine Reformadoe ſaid, their ſwords ſhall never out of their hands, as long as one Prieſt continued in <hi>England.</hi> They ſcorned all our religious dayes and duties; call them fools that pay Tythes, and them theeves that receive them;

                     <p>Sir, I am bold to impart my troubled thoughts unto you, whom I have cauſe to judge faithfull to God, your Country, and your Friend: Truly, we fear ſome hurt by theſe in Arms, if a ſpeedy courſe be not taken with ſome of them; for I find that they <note place="margin">☞</note> ſtick not to their principle of Liberty, but only in receiving it: they will not give it (if they had the power of giving it) unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.

               <p>There is a godly Miniſter of ſome place more then ordinary,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:113943:37"/>
that was in the Army about <hi>Oxford,</hi> who heard a Colonell of that Army ſpeak it in his hearing, and the hearing of many, that as for fighting againſt the <hi>Iriſh</hi> he was againſt it, for they did no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what they might do lawfully, and gave his reaſons and grounds for it; 1. Becauſe they did but fight for their Religion and Liberty of conſcience, and for their Lands and Eſtates. 2. That if the whole Commons and body of the people would agree and put down King and Parliament, overthrow the Conſtitution of this Kingdom in King, Lords, and Commons, they might do it: as this was told two godly / Miniſters, from whom I had this relation, ſo was it communicated to ſome members of both Houſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> 24. A godly Citizen told me, he heard a great Sectary that belonged to the Army ſay, ſpeaking of <hi>Ireland,</hi> he doubted, and ſo did many more in the Army, whether it were lawfull to go fight againſt the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> and that that Country was theirs, as well as <hi>England</hi> was ours.</p>
               <p>Though the boldneſſe and preſumption of many of the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, Officers and common Souldiers hath been very great, both againſt the command of God, and the Parliament, to preach in the open Churches in all Countries and places where they have come, putting by many godly and able Miniſters from their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice and invading their Pulpits; yet their open and frequent prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> doth moſt of all declare their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie, that they ſhould dare to do it in the midſt of ſo many learned men, and in a place ſo famous for learning; and that in the publike ſchools in <hi>Oxford</hi> to preach daily, and that againſt humane learning as they did for ſome time; and after complaint of it to the Generall as a thing ſo ſcandalous and odious to all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuous men, and his forbidding their preaching in the Schools; yet the Souldiers continue ſtill to preach in <hi>Oxford</hi> daily in a great houſe where they meet for that end; and I ſpak with one that came from <hi>Oxford</hi> in <hi>Aug.</hi> laſt who told me they preach now daily in <hi>Chriſts</hi> Church (one of the greateſt Colledges in <hi>Oxford)</hi> in a kind of Gallery, where the ſouldier ſtands that preaches, many ſitting on the ſtairs, others ſtanding below; and this young man heard one of them preach there, diſcourſing on theſe words: <hi>God would require the life of man at a Beaſt;</hi> this Souldier expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

that by Beaſts was meant a wicked man.</p>
               <p>There are two honeſt men, who laſt <hi>July</hi> told me, that they had heard an Independent who lives at <hi>Dover</hi> ſay it, and ſo had o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that the <hi>Scots</hi> and the Aſſembly were peſts and plagues of the Common wealth, the Aſſembly were a company of diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blers, the Presbytery was Anti-chriſtian; and ſpeaking of the Miniſters, called them, that ugly tribe.</p>
               <p>A Commander in the Army of known fidelity and worth, told me, he had heard Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> preach in <hi>Hedington</hi> Fort, againſt the City of <hi>London,</hi> incenſing the Army againſt the City; telling them, that after you have done all this, they would not have you live nor enjoy any places.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>July</hi> the firſt 1646. I was told by ſome of the Aldermen of the City, who were come that day from the Seſſions, and from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the cauſe, that a great Sectary was brought to the Seſſions of Peace before the Lord Major, for that having woed a Maid to be his wife, and he profering to be her husband, ſhe conſenting; he tooke her by the hand, and for his wife; but ſaid, he would be hanged rather then be married by a Prieſt (calling all our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters Prieſts) and perſwading her, there was no ground in the word to be married any other way: whereupon they both conſenting, came together; but afterwards, he caſt her off and would have nothing to do with her, nor allow her no meanes: This woman being brought a bed of two Children in her travell, related this, and was ready to take her Oath, the Children were his, and that ſhe never knew any man but him.</p>
               <p>Some who come from the Army tell me, that the Sectaries in the Army do exceedingly raile againſt the City and Citizens, and call them the Sect of the <hi>Adamites.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Citizen of <hi>London</hi> of good ranck, told me and divers others, that he being at <hi>Boſton</hi> Faire but a little before, there was a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander a great Sectary, ſpake to many whom he met with, againſt the City of <hi>London,</hi> how the City was quite turned againſt the Parliament, and was come to that paſſe, that if the Army came neere <hi>London</hi> to lye neere them and to awe them, they would raiſe an Army to ſet them further off; and if the Army went north-ward againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> they would help the <hi>Scots</hi> againſt them; this Citizen ſaid, he taking notice of it, ſpake freely to this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:113943:38"/>
Commander, and told him his mind of the faithfulneſſe and fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the City: and at the ſame time this Citizen related <hi>(viz.</hi> the fourth day of <hi>Auguſt)</hi> that it was given in to ſome Committee or members of a Committee, under two hands, that this Officer having an Order for ſo many Barrels of Powder and a Tunne of Match out of the Tower to ſend to ſuch a place, he never ſent it, but ſold it; and afterwards being ſold again, it came to be brought to the Tower, and ſome knew it to be ſuch Powder that was given out by order to ſuch a man: and ſo it came to be diſcovered.</p>
               <p>I was told it by two perſons of quality, a Member of the Houſe of Commons, and a miniſter, that ſome of the Sectarian Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſpeaking of the Remonſtrance, called my Lord Major Raſcall; and for thoſe who had a hand in the Remonſtrance, they hoped ere long to have the pulling them out of their houſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 30. Two perſons of quality and worth, a Reverend Miniſter, and another perſon in publick imployment, went to the <hi>Spittle</hi> in the afternoone to hear Maſter <hi>Randall</hi> (out of a deſire to be ſatisfied upon their owne knowledge (as having heard many ſtrange things of him) and coming, they heard him preach on that text, <hi>A ſower went out to ſowe:</hi> from whence he raiſed this obſervation, That all the Creatures held forth God in Chriſt, and preached the Goſpell.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The heavens declare the glory of God;</hi> that is, <hi>the glory of God in Chriſt:</hi> and he preached that all the creatures and all actions are Sacraments, and do ſet forth the death of Chriſt; common ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary eating and drinking do ſet forth the death of Chriſt, and are to be done as Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me:</hi> He gave no bleſſing at the end of his Sermon, no Pſalme was ſung; there were three great rooms full of people to hear him.</p>
               <p>A mong many Phyſitians in theſe times that are Sectaries, Independents, Anabaptiſts, Seekers, I have been told from good hands of two of them, theſe ſpeeches; one of them ſpeaking about the Miniſters, ſaid there was a neceſſity of the falling of the Tribe of <hi>Levi:</hi> The other about <hi>Aprill</hi> laſt (at which time the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents were in their great <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>About the latter end of <hi>Aprill</hi> laſt, I entreated a Doctor of

Phyſick, a godly man and prudent, to go along with me to a houſe not far from <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> where ſome company were appointed to meet me, to diſcover ſome things to me about the opinions and wayes of ſome of the Sectaries; and there came three, who in my heareing and the Doctors related theſe following particulars of Miſtris <hi>Attaway,</hi> Maſter <hi>Jenney,</hi> and ſome others of their way, and what they related were ſuch things that they had heard from their own mouthes often. Miſtris <hi>Attaway</hi> held that the Book of <hi>Eſdras</hi> and ſome other Apocryphall Books were Canonicall Scriptures; that ſhe ſhould never dye, and that ſhe ſhould bring forth Children at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and that at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhe ſhould meet with Chriſt, and enjoy him viſibly; and this Miſtris <hi>Attaway</hi> had ſo perſwaded <hi>Jenney</hi> that he beleeved he ſhould never dye, and both Miſtris <hi>Attaway</hi> and <hi>Jenney</hi> held themſelves as pure from ſinne as Chriſt was, when he was in the fleſh; and this Miſtris <hi>Attaway</hi> told Maſter <hi>Jenney</hi> ſhee had Letters ſent her from a Prophet, who was ſhut up for a time, and none could come to him; only there was a Maid one <hi>Ellen,</hi> whom they among themſelves call'd the Prophets Maid that went to him, and Miſtris <hi>Attaway</hi> ſhewed <hi>Jenney</hi> theſe Letters, which were to this effect, that ſhe muſt go to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and he muſt go with her, and he ſhould be a Preacher there, have a great hand in repairing <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and there <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> ſhould come down from Heaven, and meet them; and this Prophet by the end of this Summer ſhould come forth with power; For the preſent there was none that was an Adminiſtrator and diſpenſer with power, but this Prophet ſhould come with power, and do greater works then Chriſt, ſaving only he ſhould not dye for the ſinnes of men: This Miſtris <hi>Attaway</hi> had a great parchment role, wherein many things were written, and this was to be given to <hi>Jenney;</hi> and this <hi>Jenney</hi> beleeved all Miſtris <hi>Attaway</hi> told him as fully as might be, that he ſhould never dye, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This Miſtris <hi>Attaway</hi> alſo gave out that there ſhould come ſhips from <hi>Tarſhiſh</hi> to fetch away all the Saints to <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> and all that would not turne <hi>Jewes</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed, and this whole Land ſhould be deſtroyed, and therefore ſhe would goe away before hand to eſcape: This <hi>Jenney,</hi> Miſtris <hi>Attaway</hi> and ſome of their Tribe held no hell but what was in the conſcience; the ſoules mortall; they held the Book of <hi>Eſdr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There is one <hi>Thomas Collier</hi> a great Sectary in the Weſt of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> whom I have ſpoken of in the ſecond part of <hi>Gangraena,</hi> and have printed ſome Letters of his in this third part <note n="*" place="margin">pag. 51. 52.</note>.

of diſcourſing of the power of the Civill Magiſtrate, what hee ſhould do now religion is corrupted, and the Magiſtrates endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is to Reforme it, and to this end have called an Aſſembly of Learned men to aſſiſt them in this work: This Learned Maſter <hi>Collier</hi> if he might be thought meet, makes bold to preſent theſe <note place="margin">page 27.</note> three words in this caſe to the Parliament.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To diſmiſſe that Aſſembly of Learned men, who are now <note place="margin">page 27.</note> call'd together for to conſult about matters of Religion; and the <note place="margin">☞</note> reaſon this Learned Clark gives, is becauſe he cannot conclude that God hath any thing to do there for them; he knowes no rule in the Book of God for ſuch an Aſſembly, and therefore cannot expect a bleſſing.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Word, To go on in ſubduing of Antichriſtian ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <note place="margin">page 28.</note> ſo farre as by Civill Law they have power; for there muſt by this, or ſome other meanes be a deſolation upon the tenth part of the City.</p>
               <p>The third Word is, That the Parliament would give the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the Saints; and for who gives the Kingdom to the Saints, ſo it be done, Maſter <hi>Collier</hi> will not much diſpute whether it be the Lord Jeſus immediatly, or Jeſus by a Parliament; only <note place="margin">page 29.</note> thus much he would have men take notice that by the Kingdome is meant an externall Kingdome, for the Saints ſhall poſſeſſe that as <note place="margin">☞</note> well as the ſpirituall Kingdome and Government of the Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Hence we may ſee by Maſter <hi>Colliers</hi> words, that his Saints, <hi>viz.</hi> thoſe whom he hath deſcribed before in the former part of <note place="margin">Animadverſ.</note> his Book, Separatiſts, Anabaptiſts do look for from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they ſhould give the Kingdome to them and all tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall power and rule, and take it out of the hands of all others; So that the King, the Parliament (unleſſe there be ſome of Maſter <note place="margin">☞</note> 
                  <hi>Colliers</hi> Saints among them) the Judges, and all men who by the Lawes under the King and Parliament, have any Civill power of rule in the Kingdome, muſt have it taken from them and given to the Sectaries Saints: Yea I conceive by <hi>Colliers</hi> words not only <hi>England,</hi> but <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> are to be taken from the King, and to be given by the Lord Jeſus immediatly, or by Jeſus by a Parliament to the Saints; which whether it be not ſo or no, I leave the Reader to judge upon tranſcribing <hi>Colliers</hi> own words,

where giving his ſecond word of advice to the Parliament of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on to ſubdue Antichriſtian enemies, ſo far as they have power, becauſe there muſt by this, or ſome other meanes be a deſolation upon the tenth part of the City, he interprets his meaning in theſe following words. <hi>Which I think to be</hi> England, <hi>and thoſe Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions belonging to it,</hi> Scotland <hi>and</hi> Ireland. <hi>I conceive this to be the time that the Kingdome is to to taken from him, who ſhall ariſe and ſubdue three Kings, that is Kingdoms, ſpeaking great words, thinking to change times and Laws; but the Judgement ſhall fit and take away this Dominion to conſume it, and deſtroy it to the end,</hi> Dan. 7. 26. <hi>Therefore let not your hearts faint, neither your hands draw back, God will finiſh his work.</hi> The third Word, <hi>is, that they would give the Kingdome to the Saints,</hi> Dan. 7. 27. <hi>Who gives the Kingdome to the Saints?

               <p>I Have received lately certaine Information, from ſome who are come out of <hi>Wales,</hi> that a Trooper of Colonell <hi>Riches</hi> Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment hath been for divers weeks laſt paſt in <hi>Wales</hi> in <hi>Radnorſhire,</hi> and <hi>Brecknockeſhire,</hi> a preaching and dipping, where he hath vent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed many Doctrines of Antinomianiſme and Anabaptiſme, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized hundreds in thoſe Countries; Among others, one wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whom he dipped, he held ſo long under water, that what with the water getting into her, and cold ſhe died of it within a day or two. This Trooper going from theſe Countries into <hi>Mongo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meryſhire</hi> another Countie of <hi>Wales</hi> to preach and dippe, ſome in command and Armes for the Parliament, ſeized on him and committed him to priſon; but within a while after this commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by meanes uſed by ſome in the Army there comes an order from higher Authority to thoſe who committed him to releaſe him, and ſo he was ſet free. A Religious Commander who comes from thence tells me, the preaching and dipping of this Trooper and other ſuch, makes the Countries being newly reduced, have an ill opinion of the Parliament; and many of the people ſay, theſe are your Preachers at <hi>London,</hi> and ſuch Preachers as the Parliament <note place="margin">☜</note> ſends; for they being ignorant people, think verily theſe men are ſent forth by the Parliament to preach to them. This Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander tells me alſo there is a ſtrong report in thoſe Countries of <hi>Wales</hi> where he hath been, that there are ſome Sectaries preach for Circumciſion, and that ſome have been Circumciſed, but the truth of that he cannot aſſert, as of the reſt, but muſt have more time to find it out.</p>
               <p>There is a Miniſter now in <hi>London,</hi> or here abouts, who going to a meeting of the Sectaries, heard one of them in his Exerciſing, and preaching to the company aſſembled, affirme that he was Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; whereupon this Miniſter ſpake to him, and ſaid how

can you be Jeſus Chriſt, where are the prints of the nailes in your hands? unto which this wicked Sectarie replyed ſhowing him his hands, here they are, and in one of his hands there were ſome markes, which he ſaid were the prints of the nailes; but ſaid this Sectarie, for all this you will not beleeve me to be Chriſt unleſſe you ſaw Miracles, and turning over his Bible to the Book of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> this Sectary quoted a place that Miracles were wrought to confirme the Doctrine of Divells, which ſaith he you would have me to ſhew to confirme the truth. This is a moſt certain ſtory, related by an eare and eye witneſſe to a Noble Earle of this Kingdom, and to ſome others, and the place where this Sectary dwells related alſo with many circumſtances.</p>
               <p>Some of the Sectarian ſouldiers quartering very dately at a Towne in <hi>Leſter ſhire,</hi> upon the Lords day ſome of them ſhooed their horſes; others who came into the Church, diſturbed and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted a godly Miniſter one Maſter <hi>Boh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And as their carriage was ſo in the Church, ſo a Townſman who rented the Tythes, being upon horſe in the field looking after his Tyth corne, ſome of theſe ſouldiers coming into the field asked who that was, and being told he was a man that came to gather Tyths, they came to him, and one took one leg, and another the other, and others laid hands on him in other parts, and threw him off his horſe abuſing him, and hazarding the limbs of the man, becauſe he renting the Tythes, came to look after them.</p>
               <p>When the Army was marching from <hi>Exeter</hi> for <hi>Oxford,</hi> upon their marching, there was a Faſt kept by the Army, and upon that Faſt day divers of the Sectarian ſouldiers inſtead of keeping it were drinking all the day in Ale-houſes and many of them were ſtark drunk. Of this there was a Letter written from a worthy Colonell in the Army, which was communicated to divers perſons of worth, and a worthy Member of the Houſe of Commons who read it, and knew all the particulars, of place, time, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> related it to me in the hearing of a Member of the ſame Houſe.</p>

                     <p>THough the Stories of Errors and Hereſies be ſo ſad as that pious ſouls cannot but mourn and ſigh, and grieve much at the reading of them; yet ſince your publiſhing of them is many wayes uſefull, as that falſe Doctrines and falſe Teachers might bee diſcovered and made odious, and that truth might bee the more manifeſt to, and lovely in the profeſſors of it, <hi>oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſita juxta ſe poſita magis eluceſcunt;</hi> Wherefore I have ſent you a Copie of thoſe Errors which were ſtifly defended by one <hi>William Bowling</hi> of <hi>Crambrock</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> on Wedneſday laſt, the eighth of <hi>July</hi> 1646 in my paſſage with him in a pair of Oares from <hi>Graveſend</hi> to <hi>London,</hi> there bee five other paſſengers in the Boat that did witneſſe theſe Errors and Hereſies to be ſtoutly
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:113943:44"/>
aſſerted by the party aforeſaid, ſo that you may be confident you ſhall publiſh nothing but the Truth, in publiſhing that theſe Errors following were vented and juſtified by him in leſſe then foure houres paſſage upon the waters.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. He affirmed that <hi>Adams</hi> ſinne in eating the forbidden fruit did not deſerve Hell.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. That Heavens bleſſedneſſe was not propoſed to <hi>Adam</hi> in caſe of his obedience, therefore Hells torments were not threatned to <hi>Adam,</hi> nor due to him in caſe of his diſobedience.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That all the children of <hi>Adam</hi> that dye in their infancie, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be children of <hi>Turks</hi> or Infidels, are undobtedly ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as well as the children of Chriſtians, and would prove it out of <hi>John</hi> 1. 29. where, by ſinne he meant only Originall, where he ſeems to croſſe his firſt point.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. That Chriſts bloud did not purchaſe Heaven for any man. And being asked how came the Saints to be in Heaven: He anſwered, Heaven is a gift given to the Saints as a reward of Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe without relation to his Death and Suffrings which were endured for to be our example, not to purchaſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for us.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. That Chriſt ſhed his bloud for kine and horſes and all other creatures, as well as for men, miſerably perverting that Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture in the eigth to the <hi>Romans</hi> 19, 20, 21, 22. verſes.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. That the Heavens and the Earth mentioned, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. ſhall not be ſet on fire, nor are they reſerved for the judgement and perdition of ungodly men; And that there is no other fire in Hell, then the Hell that is and ſhall be in mens conſciences.</p>
                     <p n="7">7. That the ſouls of Divels and all other men are mortall as well as their bodies, and that there was none immortall but God.</p>
                     <p n="8">8. That if the ſoul which was the breath of God were not mortal, then the breath of God, which is part of God, ſhould be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally tormented in Hell.</p>
                     <p n="9">9. That (thoſe words) <hi>to day,</hi> or, <hi>this day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe,</hi> is ſo to be underſtood (1) at the day of Reſurrection when I come perſonally to reign upon earth a 1000 yeers, at that day ſhalt thou be with me in my Kingdom, for there is Gods Kingdom which Chriſt has now, and there is Chriſts

Kingdom, which the Theifſhall ſhare in then.</p>
                     <p n="10">10. He a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>firmed that place <hi>Revel.</hi> 20. 6. to be meant of a perſonall reign of Chriſt in his body upon earth a 1000 yeers.</p>
                     <p n="11">11. He affirmed that place in <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 7. is not to be underſtood as if the ſoul after death was really ſeparated from the body, for ſayes he, the ſouls of men reſt in the grave with their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies till the Reſurrection, and then Chriſt raiſes up both toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; the ſoul may return to God that gave it, though it lay with the body in the grave, for God is preſent every where, and the ſoul went no more to God then the body did.</p>
                     <p n="12">12. It is injuſtice in God to puniſh the ſouls of the wicked in Hell while their bodies lay at reſt in their graves, for ſeeing both were ſinners together, both muſt be ſufferers together, if God ſhould puniſh the ſoul of <hi>Cain</hi> in Hell ſive or ſix thouſand yeers before he puniſh the body of <hi>Cain,</hi> he then would ſhew himſelf partiall in his diſtribution of juſtice.</p>
                     <p n="13">13. He ſaid, ſinne was not conveyed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>o <hi>Adams</hi> poſterity by <hi>Adams</hi> loynes, He was askt, how then came we to be ſinners? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, only by Satan, for Satan was the father, and our hearts was the mother to receive Satans ſeed, for the Devill is the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of all actuall ſinnes in men, and begets ſinne in them as the Adulterer begets an Adulterous <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ood upon the Adultereſſe, there can be but one father of one child, ſo there can be but one father of ſinne, and that is the Devill, for he is called the father of lyes.</p>
                     <p n="14">14. And he being told that the Devill was but a partiall not a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall cauſe in the production of ſinne, for the Devill he works ſinne <hi>inſtigando,</hi> by temptation, and corrupt nature works ſinne <hi>efficaciter agendo &amp; operando,</hi> by begetting actuall ſinnes, <hi>James 1. 15. Luſt it bringeth forth ſinne.</hi> And the law in <hi>Pauls</hi> mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers did bring me (ſaies <hi>Paul)</hi> into captivity to the law of ſinne. But he replyed ſaying, The Devill was not only a partiall, but a totall father in begetting ſinne upon <hi>Adams</hi> pure ſoul, for <hi>Adam</hi> had no corrupt nature to help him ſinne the firſt ſinne, therefore it was wholly from Satan.</p>
                     <p>I told him the Devill could not by his temptation defile a pure ſoul, that is, not conſenting to his temptation, for then he would have defiled Jeſus Chriſt when he was tempted by the Devill,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:113943:45"/>
therefore I conceive the chief cauſe of <hi>Adams</hi> fall was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of <hi>Adams</hi> own will, which could not be forced by Satan, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had power to ſtand againſt Satans temptations, as well as power to fall.</p>
                     <p>But ſeeing there would be no end of diſpute, I deſired the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple preſent in the Boat to beware of his Errors. But he ſaid, they were ſuch as I that did deceive the people, and we would not open our eyes to ſee the light; our receiving of Tyths did blind us, but he hoped ſhortly there would be no Tythes paid in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>How then will you have the Miniſters of the Goſpel live of the Goſpel?</p>
                     <p n="15">15. He anſwered they muſt take ſuch as the people will give them, and if their people will not maintain them, they muſt work with their hands as <hi>Paul</hi> did.</p>
                     <p n="16">16. He further ſaid our Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> were Antichriſtian Miniſters, and our Parochiall Congregations were no Churches, nor was there any Nationall Church now under the Goſpel, though I told him where ever there is a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion profeſſing the Goſpel according to the Word, there muſt needs be a Nationall Church under the Goſpel, But in <hi>England</hi> there is ſuch a Nation profeſſing the Goſpel, and to be ruled according to the Word of God, witneſſe our Nationall Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; ſome corrupt members in the Nation do not hinder the being of a Nationall Church,</p>
                     <p>I askt him what he thought of the repreſentative body of the Nation now aſſembled in Parliament, and of the Clergy now aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in the Synod, He anſwered, as for the Aſſembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, they are as bad as other Miniſters, and that he hoped ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they would be as contemptible as the Biſhops are; and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they could prove themſelves to be guided by an infallible ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, <note place="margin">☞</note> the Parliament need not accept their adviſe, though they have called them to give their adviſe in the things of Chriſts Kingdom; but the Parliament I hope ſhortly will diſmiſſe them, ſayes he, and call others in a new Aſſembly, that may adviſe them better then they do.</p>
                     <p>Sir, I have hitherto told you a few things of thoſe many that were in diſcourſe between this <hi>William Bowling</hi> and my ſelf, hee

wearied me and perplexed me ſo with his erroneous, hereticall, and wild diſputation, that when we came aſhore at Billinſgate, I was ſorry that I forgate to have him apprehended here, before the Committee of Examinations, who would have ſifted him to purpoſe. I do hear that Maſter <hi>Williamſon</hi> of <hi>Cranbrook</hi> hath heretofore had him before the Committee at <hi>Ailesford</hi> in <hi>Kent</hi> for ſome miſdemeanors, And I hear by others that the man doth Patrizare in ſome of his opinions, but no wonder the world is full of ſuch, and the Church too, and there muſt be Hereſies, and Sects, that they which are approved may be made manifeſt among us. The good Lord in due time purge his Church, and now his Fanne is in his hand, let us pray that he may thoroughly purge his floore; nothing but pure Wheat ſhall be in the Lords Barne: Lord thy will be done in Earth as it is in Heaven, ſo commending your holy labours both in Pulpit and Preſſe to the bleſſing of God I reſt</p>

Our Conſtables are oppoſed in doing their duties; in a word, they do openly contemne, and violently incroach upon the civill power contrary to former ordem ſent them: Yeſterday they demanded more monies of us for the Garriſon; We do what in

But the inſolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of this day is ſuch, that we thought it our duty to make this preſent diſpatch to you, doubting what a day may bring forth. The cauſe is thus; we taking notice of the frequent preaching of Captaines at the Caſtle, Guild-Hall, and in private houſés, and of their drawing away of the people, thought it neceſſary, with the advice of Miniſters, to have the Ordinance of Parliament of the twentie ſixth of <hi>Aprill,</hi> 1645. to be publiſhed, which prohibits all ſuch to preach as were not ordained Miniſters, &amp;c. which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly was read at the Cathedrall before the morning Sermon this day; The Deputy Governour hearing it, commands it to be read the ſecond and third time, the Officers jeering and ſcoffing <note place="margin">☞</note> all the time of the publiſhing of it, in contempt both of the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and of the Committee. After the Sermon was ended, the Deputy Governour moſt preſumptuouſly ſtands up in the Biſhops ſeat, and takes upon him publikely to give the meaning of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and ſaith aloud, that it did not forbid their meetings, and that in the after-noones they would have their exerciſe in the Cuſtle (which accordingly they had) and that he had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the City, and of all that were in it; with many words to the like effect: After ſtands up Captaine Leivtenant <hi>Vernum,</hi> and openly ſaies that in deſpight of men they would have their exerciſe, adding at laſt with ſubmiſſion to Authority; Preſently after Maſter <hi>Parſons,</hi> who publiſhed the Ordinance was ſent for, and although he ſhewed the order of the Committee, yet he was ſent to priſon by the Deputy Governour; the whole Church was in an uproare and the City is in diſorder; what the conſequence may be we know not; we have been and ſtill are affronted by the <note place="margin">☞</note> Garriſon, and the civill power is in a manner trampled under foot. We conceive the publike preſumption to interpret an Ordinance of Parliament, and to commit to priſon the publiſher of it, is ſuch an act as cannot be paralled in the whole Kingdome. We have written to Maſter <hi>Prideaux</hi> very earneſtly about it, and have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to impart it to the Committee of the Weſt; the like requeſt is made to you, that ſo ſome ſpeedy courſe may be taken herein, and an anſwer returned to</p>

                  <hi>Scots</hi> conſtantly abuſed: In their Sermons Maſter <hi>Del,</hi> and <hi>Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marſh</hi> preach free grace, and ſay, Chriſt judges not by the eye, or eare, he regards not mens prayers or duties; if they have Chriſt in their heart, though they do not read and pray, and trade in duties, Chriſt judges them according to their heart. Secondly, We have no uſe of ſecular power, and they that would borrowe the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrats power to make a Reformation in the Kingdome of Chriſt are Anti-chriſtian; it is an evident ſigne that they have not the word nor ſpirit to ſpeak for them: Alas what can the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate convert ſoules with the civ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I told them that if this doctrine were true, they might disband the Army. Thirdly, They preſſed hard to have the law of Love and Liberty obſerved, that there may be an equality; that is their phraſe and the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts. <note place="margin">☜</note> Fourthly, They are moſt offended with that paſſage of the Remonſtrance about places of publike truſt. Fifthly, There is <note place="margin">☜</note> no need of Univerſities; for if men be annointed with the ſpirit, and accepted amongſt the Saints, they are ſufficiently qualified for the Miniſtery. Sixthly, <hi>Paul Hobſon</hi> the Taylor, and Leivtenant
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:113943:49"/>
Colonell <hi>Hewſon</hi> the one-eyed Shoomaker (as Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> calls him) are the moſt renouned preachers, but <hi>Hobſon</hi> hath ſaluted the Army with a farwell Sermon, and is ſent as an Emiſſary to <hi>Exeter,</hi> to raiſe a party there. Seventhly, <hi>Banbury</hi> Caſtle muſt not be ſlighted, they ſay it may be a Garriſon for the Saints, it is concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be the ſtrongeſt in <hi>England.</hi> They uſe an Argument which takes with people much, that if they will joyne with them, they ſhall pay no Tythes; and ſome are ſo fooliſh to give out, there is a conſiderable party in all Countries where ere they have been, <note place="margin">☞</note> that will ſtand for them, ſo they may be excuſed for paying Tythes. Ninthly, Though that Argument do generally take with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane men, yet they ſee there are a company of godly men that are willing to pay Tythes; to them therefore they urge all Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt mixed communion, and they aſſure them that the Aſſembly will beare with all cloſe dangerous Malignants that can ſpeake Greek and Latine, if they be not ſcandalous in their lives, and will conforme to the Presbyteriall government and obſerve the Directorie. Tenthly, They would not have the old military Orders obſerved, which was ſet forth by the Earle of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> that Blaſphemers ſhould be bored through the tongue: The Argument which they urged was, that ſinnes whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

I hope there will be a disbanding very ſhortly; if not, there are five Regiments that want Colonells, and if there could be five Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians put in, the Independents would be well ballanced, for there are a great many conſiderable men in this Army well affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all godly Presbyterians.</p>

               <p>You take it for granted that Chriſts command bears nothing but the baptiſm of beleevers; but how will this be proved? That Chriſt commanded beleevers to be baptized, ye &amp; only beleevers being of age when they enter into Covenant, this is granted; but that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore abſolutely none but Beleevers (actuall Beleevers) by Chriſts command are to be baptized, it followes not.

So neither are ſuch infants excluded from Baptiſme, becauſe Chriſt ſaid <hi>Go, &amp;c. baptiſe all Nations, He that beleeveth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved.</hi> When Circumciſion was in uſe, faith was required in men of yeers, before it might be adminiſtred to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 11. yet this hindred not, but that it was to be adminiſtred to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.

How God will be pleaſed to afford me ſucceſſe in my endeavours with you I cannot tell, but I will not be afraid to ſay that I am ſure I defend the truth, and yet not I but the ſpirit of God that is within me; I know what conſtruction you will be apt to make of this expreſſion, but I will reſerve my defence, till I receive my fore-ſeen objection.

               <p>TO fulfill your deſires, I here give you a few anſwers to your propoſitions: Firſt, for this propoſition, what diſorder will this produce if there be not prayer in families?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> If whole families be Saints then you may pray with them, and pray as often as the ſpirit moves you; But this is the miſery, we have taken up things upon truſt, and done what wee thought good, and have not eyed the rule and direction of the word.</p>
               <p>2. Prayer is a naturall thing, for it is a principle of nature in all men to call upon God, ſo do Turks and Heathens; but God is a God of knowledge, and what is not of faith is ſinne; ſo though the wicked pray, they being unbeleevers, their prayer is ſinne: <hi>Paul</hi> in the Acts reproveth the ſuperſtitious ignorant worſhip of them there, when he found their ſuperſcription to the unknowne God, <hi>whom,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>yee ignorantly worſhip, him declare I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>nto you;</hi> ſo that ignorant people they cannot pray, they muſt have God declared unto them.</p>
               <p>3. Wee have no example nor precept in all the Goſpel for Saints to pray with unbeleevers; when Chriſt prayed he took his Diſciples apart; indeed he taught and exhorted all; ſo the Saints in the Acts they prayed alone from the world; and Chriſt ſaith goe preach the Goſpel to all, he doth not ſay goe pray with all; and Chriſt nor his Apoſtles never prayed with the world; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles taught in their Synagogues and expounded in their Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, but not a word of praying with them; and experience
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:113943:56"/>
teacheth us how our hearts are ſtraitned, and how wee limit the ſpirit (if I may ſo ſpeak) when we pray with unbeleevers, and faith commeth not by praying with them, but by preaching, for faith commeth by hearing: I know no word for the Miniſters praying with the world, nor Saints to joyne with them.</p>

                  <hi>Object.</hi> But Chriſt gave thanks: The Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> gave thanks before them all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Chriſts thankſgiving was ſometimes miraculous, for by his bleſſing the creature he did a miracle; ſo the Apoſtle's was too, as farre as I know; for you know how wonderfully after hee and all with them were preſerved: Or if we may give thanks with them, it is becauſe all have a right to the creatures reſtored them by Chriſt, that in a way of exhortation or praiſe a Saint may informe them therein of their right by Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But what ſhall they do that have families, ſhall they be as Heathens? doth not the word ſay that he will pour out his w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> That makes nothing for it, for it is not ſaid that the Heathen and theſe that know him not, ſhall call on his Name; this is not for it, but to ſhew the miſery of theſe that cannot; ſure it is ſweet for Saints to eye the rule for all that they do: Sure I do not write this that I would diminiſh any of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beleevers priviledges; for Chriſt Jeſus knowes my heart is more pitifull unto them then ever; but I finde in the word that the Goſpel muſt be preached unto them, they muſt be exhorted and pitied and prayed for, and Saints muſt ſhine before them by a holy —</p>

               <p>MUch reſpected, I give you many thanks for your love when I was with you; ſince we have ſpoken to M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. <hi>Roats</hi> about a conference, but as yet have no ſatisfying Anſwer: So ſoon as we heard of their intention to chuſe their Officers, we ſent a Note to him to this effect, That whereas we heard it was their reſolution ſo to do ſuch a day; that we deſired him, if that ſo he could with conveniency to forbear and ſuſpend the doing thereof for a time, in regard that we deſired that there might firſt be a conference in the place by ſome Godly Miniſters, that if it might be, the true way might be more cleerly found out, that thoſe that are deceived or miſled, might be undeceived, ſo as we might aſſent to them or they to us, ſo far as truth might appear ſo; his Anſwer was firſt before any thing was done that they might have ſatisfaction given for what wrongs they had ſuſtained. And 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi>ly, he would allow us to propound ſome queſtions, provided they might do the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt our way; ſo ſeeing no better anſwer could be had, and that they reſolved ſtill to go on ſtill in their buſineſſe: It was thought fit by the Inhabitants of the place for that day to lock the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel door, to teſtifie their not approving their way, and ſo it was done; the which doth much incenſe them: and the laſt Sabboth they had the liberty of the Chappel, wherein they began their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection by the Deacons.</p>
               <p>And in the forenoon ſuch words as theſe was expreſſed in his Sermon, as it was given in to me by an honeſt underſtanding man that was preſent, in an Uſe of exhortation, to thoſe that are joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in Societies in a viſible Church, <hi>viz.

It was related to me by a Juſtice of Peace who was an eare and eye witneſſe, and by a godly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> that there is one <hi>Kendall</hi> (who in the Biſhops times was a great creature of Sir <hi>John Lams,</hi> a bower at the Altar and for all the Innovations) but ſince theſe times of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctariſme,

is turned a great Sectary, having renounced his Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. This man is now a Captaine in <hi>Whitleſey</hi> the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> that Iland of Errors and Sectaries, and a great Preacher, who comes ſometimes to viſit <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> where formerly he was a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.

For <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

Secondly, that <hi>Adams</hi> righteouſneſſe in Innocencie was but fleſh, and oppoſed to the ſpirit. Maſter <hi>Baſely</hi> in the afternoone preaching, confuted his Doctrines, this <hi>Kendall</hi> would have ſtood up in the Church, and have oppoſed him, but was hindred by a Juſtice of Peace who was preſent.</p>
               <p>The 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1646. A godly Miniſter living in <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> told me and another City Miniſter, that he hath in his Pariſh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Manifeſtarians, Diſciples and followers of one <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> ſpoken of in my Firſt and Second Part of <hi>Gangraena,</hi> who upon his knowledge will keep no dayes of Faſt, nor none of the dayes of Thankſgiving, becauſe they will not give thanks to God for one man killing of another. He told me that ſome of the Manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarians hold, and he hath heard ſome of them ſay, they had ſeen Chriſt, and ſeen the Devill to. This Miniſter related to us that there was a young maiden in his Pariſh about 16 yeares of age, one — who preaches to many young men and maidens, he na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med her name, and I well remember it, but forbeare naming her, becauſe being ſo young, happily ſhe may be reclaimed. This <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Moore</hi> comes often into this part of <hi>Lincolnſhire,</hi> and divers times to this Towne where he preaches in houſes; but the laſt time he was there he preached not, and the reaſon (ſome of the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries give out) was becauſe this godly Miniſter is a perſecutor, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay becauſe he could not have the uſe of a great houſe in that Pariſh for his company to meet in. Many of theſe Manifeſtari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans being at a time together, there was ſome occaſion fell out to
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:113943:66"/>
ſend for the Conſtable of the Town, who being come, charged ſome of the company in the Kings name to aid him, to which ſome of the Sectaries replied, that the King was out of office; and therefore to require any thing in the Kings name was nothing.</p>
               <p>A Fellow of a Colledge in <hi>Cambridge</hi> (whom I well know) meeting me in <hi>London,</hi> told me he had been lately at the Leaguer before <hi>Oxford,</hi> and in the company of ſome of the Sectaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Army, where he met with one M. <hi>Wainwright</hi> (ſo he related his name, formerly a Miniſter, who ſaid he came out of ſuch a Country <hi>(Suffolk</hi> as I remember) and had a Living there of two hundred pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> this man boaſted he had pull'd down the Biſhops, and hoped to do as much for ſome others, meaning the Presbyters; he vapoured he had left his Living as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Antichriſtian, and ſaith he, I have every day ſince asked God forgiveneſſe for holding it; he told me alſo that in the Army he was told from good hands, of an Officer, a civill gallant man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would anſwer the Sectaries when they ſpake for their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and againſt the Presbyterians, was upon other pretended ſuggeſtions either formally caſheered, or glad to be gone.</p>
               <p>There are foure famous Preachers in <hi>Hartfordſhire</hi> (as I have it from ſure hands) one <hi>Heath the</hi> Collar-maker of <hi>Watton,</hi> one <hi>Rice</hi> the <hi>Tinker</hi> of <hi>Aſton,</hi> one <hi>Feild</hi> the Bodieſ-maker of <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> one <hi>Crew</hi> the Taylor of <hi>Stevenage;</hi> and beſides theſe, there are ſome other Preachers who ſometimes were Miniſters in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but now great Sectaries, as Maſter <hi>Feake</hi> at <hi>All-Saints</hi> Church in <hi>Hartford,</hi> one Maſter <hi>Harriſon</hi> about Saint <hi>Albons</hi> ſide, and ſome others of whoſe ſtrange preachings, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes, of the complaint to the Judges at the Aſſiſe of Maſter <hi>Feake, &amp;c.</hi> I ſhall hereafter in a fourth part of <hi>Gangraena,</hi> or ſome other Tractate about the Sects, give the Reader an account.</p>

Preacher of the Army, and a young <hi>Peters</hi> (as he was called) ſome who were eare-witneſſes told me of his Sermon, and it was to this effect; That the Country people ſay (that is, he meant the Sectaries in the Army ſay) that the Parliament would do them good, but he Lord Major, the Common-Councell and the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of <hi>London</hi> would not permit them; he feared God would bring the Plague upon them, and Riſings among them; and the cauſe of all was, the uncharitableneſſe of <hi>London</hi> againſt the Saints; and that the oppoſition now was not between worldly men, but between Saints and Saints.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Downing,</hi> alias <hi>Peter</hi> junior, ſpake in <hi>Hackney</hi> pulpit of the Common Councell of <hi>London</hi> at that time in way of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 span">

This <hi>Mary Abraham</hi> before her coming to Maſter <hi>Clarks</hi> had intangled a young youth, an Apprentice here in <hi>London,</hi> and clai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med a promiſe of marriage at his hand, which buſineſſe was heard before Maſter <hi>Jeſſe</hi> the Seeker, an Independent Miniſter and ſome others, and it was concluded he ſhould give her ten pounds, and ſo there ſhould be an end between them; which this youth gave her, and there was a writing of diſcharge between them, which ten pounds given by the boy M. <hi>Jeſſe</hi> received; and faith, it was ſince gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Parliament.

                  <hi>July</hi> the eighth, a godly Miniſter lately of this City, told me in the preſence and hearing of other Miniſters as a certain truth, this ſtory, That at a houſe in <hi>Red-croſſe</hi> ſtreet or thereabouts, there met ſome Sectaries, where ſome forty perſons being preſent, one of then exerciſed his gifts, and in his exerciſe preached theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines.</p>

               <p>A godly Miniſter of <hi>Briſtow,</hi> preaching in <hi>Briſtow</hi> by way of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation, to exhort men to goe out of themſelves, and to reſt on Chriſt, one ſtood up in the Church, either whilſt hee was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or preſently upon finiſhing his Sermon, telling him that hee had preached Antichriſtianiſme to exhort men. The ſame Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter related it, that a Souldier a great Sectary finding fault with ſomething hee had preached of Chriſts wondring at their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leefe, hee told him they were Chriſts words; to which this Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctary replyed, Chriſt ſpake thus in his darkneſſe, or in the time of his darkneſſe.

               <p>A godly Miniſter who lives in <hi>Somerſetſhire</hi> told me of a Sectary and a Sequeſtrator, who to him maintained Adultery was no ſinne; and to another Miniſter, that drunkenneſſe was no ſinne, but a help to ſee Chriſt the better by. Hee told me alſo that ſome Sectaries, having a Book among them called <hi>The fulneſſe of Gods love,</hi> maintained generall election, that God had choſen all men to life, and that election was of all men; with whom this Miniſter reaſoned, alledging that in the 9. of the <hi>Romanes,</hi> verſ. 11, 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and telling them, the word Election implied it was of ſome, not of all; for if I come and chuſe, I take ſome, and leave others; but if I take all, I doe not chuſe.</p>

And Maſter <hi>Burroughs</hi> in his preaching at <hi>Cornhill,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what hee may doe in other places, hath often ſtrange paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and flings, as a little before that, againſt the City Remonſtrance, (though hee named it not) which many took notice of; and at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times againſt the Presbyterians, comparing them to <hi>Eſau,</hi> and the Independents to <hi>Jacob;</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Eſau,</hi> how many rough, wild men had been brought down in the field, and wee had at home many <hi>Eſaus,</hi> wild, rough men againſt their brethren, who hee doubted not ſhould be brought down in due time; or words to that effect.</p>
               <p>There is one Maſter <hi>Symonds</hi> of <hi>Sandwich</hi> a great Independent, who preached, that though hee would not ſay that all who came not into the Church-way were damned, yet hee would ſay that all who had opportunity to joyne to that way, and did not, but lived and died without repentance, for not coming into the Church-way, ſhould be damned: And, ſaith hee, we had been in the Church-way in this place before now, but for an Apoſtate Brother in this Town, ſpeaking of a godly Miniſter once an Independent, but converted from the error of that way: and this Maſter <hi>Symonds</hi> brought that place <hi>Zech.</hi> 14. 17, 18, 19. that <hi>the Lord will ſmite them

This Maſter <hi>Symonds</hi> reporting of this godly Miniſter that hee was a lyar, hee went to him with two more, in a faire way, to ſpeak to him, and this Maſter <hi>Symonds</hi> was ſo imperious and high, that hee called this godly Miniſter, An intolerable Fellow and malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. Some of the Magiſtrates of that Town asking Maſter <hi>Symonds,</hi> why divers of the people in the time of the publike Aſſemblies met in private, hee anſwered, Can you blame them, when they have nothing but bread and cheeſe in publike? ſpeaking of this godly mans Miniſtery. Now upon occaſion of Maſter <hi>Symonds</hi> branding this godly Miniſter for an Apoſtate, becauſe hee had forſaken the Independent way, this godly Miniſter preſently after in his owne Church publikely confeſſed, hee was once of the Independent way, and actually entered into a Church Covenant, and would baptize none but the children of parents in the Church Covenant; but (ſaith hee) this was, when I was in the Iland of <hi>Providence</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, and in the dark; but when I came into <hi>England,</hi> ſince this Parliament, and compared both wayes together, the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and Independent, confer'd with divers Miniſters about them, read books, as Maſter <hi>Rutherfords, &amp;c.</hi> heard Maſter <hi>John Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> preach ſome Sermons for Presbytery, I ſaw the power of the Keyes to be in the Miniſters of the Church, not the people, the Church Covenant, and all thoſe wayes of admiſſion, requiring men to give ſignes of grace, &amp;c. to be Will-worſhips; when I came to hold up the Independent way in the light, (like as men doe the cloth they buy) I ſaw it was a moth eaten garment, and had many flawes in it. Hee told the people hee had been humbled privately before God, that hee had been of that way, and now deſired to be publikely humbled for it; and confeſſed his ſinne in being a Miniſter of an Independent Church, and gave God glory, ſaying, <hi>I am not aſhamed to recant that</hi> wherein I did amiſſe and was miſtaked; it was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

I ſhall inſtance now only in a few things by which the Reader may judge of the man, and of his way. A very god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and judicious Miniſter told me, that he being at <hi>London</hi> about Spring was a twelve month, he went to heare Maſter <hi>Goodwin</hi> preach, who preaching upon that ſubject how hard a thing it was to beleeve the Goſpel, aggravated the hardneſſe of beleeving by theſe Reaſons, one was becauſe there were many contradictions in the Scripture as they appeared to us, and he inſtanced in divers, as about Juſtification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A ſecond was, becauſe take two men of equall abilities for holineſſe, learning, parts, and theſe ſhall expound the Scripures different wayes, ſo that which Expoſition ſhall a man take to in this caſe? Now beſides theſe he gave di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers others ſuch Reaſons, never ſalving or reconciling any of them; ſo that the Miniſter profeſſed to me, he trembled to heare him, and hath looked upon him ever ſince as a wicked man, judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſcope of his preaching, was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Another godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter tells me, that ſome judicious hearers, among the reſt a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of parts, going to heare him preach on a Lords day, he then was upon the Majeſtie of the Scriptures, and among other inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to prove the Majeſtie of the Scriptures, he ſpoke of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions in the Scripture, and went over many particulars, and ſo left them without any ſolution or Anſwer; at which this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was ſo offended, that he ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>e of this to divers the ſame day, and ſaid the Sermon was enough to have made all them A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts who heard it. A godly Miniſter in the City hearing him preach (and as I remember) it was on his Tuſeday Lecture at his Conventicle houſe, upon that point that there were many ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary truths that cannot be proved by Scriptures, ſave only by a ſtrong hand of Reaſon; and inſtancing in that point of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chriſt to be God, he runne over thoſe Scriptures brought to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:113943:84"/>
prove Chriſt to be God, and anſwered them with the Arian, and Socinians evaſions, and ſo left them, never taking away thoſe An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, as if the man would in a ſubtle cloſe way, whil'ſt he ſeemed to prove ſomthing elſe, and confute the Anabaptiſts, ſow the ſeeds of Socinianiſme: This Miniſter was much troubled at it, ſpake of it to many Miniſters of the City, how no Socinian could have pleaded againſt Chriſt being God, more then M. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> ſo far as concerned the eluding of thoſe Scriptures, which are the proofs of it, and could not but leave a tincture in the mind of the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, that it could not be proved by Scripture that Jeſus Chriſt was God, ſeeing the cheif and moſt pregnant places for it were ſo Anſwered.</p>
               <p>Theſe practiſes and way of <hi>Cretenſis,</hi> brings to my mind the practiſe of <hi>Sebaſtian Franck,</hi> a Learned man, and indeed the moſt Learned Sectary of all the Sectaries in theſe latter times, both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and in his age, who hath written a Book <hi>ex profeſſo,</hi> to ſhew the diſcordances of Scriptures, laying down many inſtances in this kind, and ſo leaving them without ſhewing any harmony or agreement; Which <hi>Franck</hi> being a great Seeker, and Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſt, did it without all queſtion upon a deſigne to drawe men off from the Scriptures, to Revelations. Two religious and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding Citizens told me the tenth of <hi>June</hi> laſt, and ſaid they could bring many more to atteſt it, that they heard (not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) Maſter <hi>John Goodwin</hi> preach at his Conventicle as followes; <q>That we ſhould not condemne any thing for an Error, till we had taken as much paines in the ſearching out whether it were ſo or no, as he which broached the Error had done in promoting it; for he did beleeve a man might ſerve God better in an Error, then he who was in the truth.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Here is a brave Patron of Error and a fine fetch to plead for and uphold it, for if Errour muſt not be condemned till men have taken ſo</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Animadverſ.</note> 
                  <hi>much paines, it may never be ſpoken againſt, or at leaſt not till 'tis grown to ſuch a head that 'tis paſt help: For a Heretick who broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches any Doctrine againſt the Scripures, the Trinity, the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſt, Juſtification, may ſay to him who oppoſes theſe Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines, I have ſtudied this twenty yeares theſe points; when you have ſtudied them as long, then preach <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:113943:84"/>
Beſides this implies as if Ministers and Chriſtians could not be ſure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Doctrines were Errors, without long ſearching whether they were ſo or no, and as if there were no received known principls and Doctrines of Chriſtian Religion, lay'd down ſo plainly and clearly in Scriptures, that when errors were publiſhed contrary to them, Miniſters and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians might not condemne them at firſt, but must ſtudy and ſearch to know whether they were Errors or no; which preaching fits well with many paſſages in ſome Books of</hi> Cretenſis, <hi>eſpecially his thirtie eight Queres upon the Ordinance againſt Hereſie and Blaſphemie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <q>There are many thouſand truths both to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and practiſed, that are not contained in the Scriptures, as that Jeſus Chriſt Son of the Virgin. <hi>Mary</hi> was the Son of God; as the Reſurrection from the dead, as Baptizing of Infants, womens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Sacrament of the Lords Supper; all which could not be proved by Scripture, but by a ſtrong hand of Reaſon deducing</q> them. Many other paſſages I have from good hands of <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſis</hi> preaching, of his preferring Reaſon before Faith in points of Religion; of holding the ſleeping of the ſoule till the Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of bodies that dye not riſing the ſame again, with divers ſuch; but I ſhall reſerve them, with the proofs of them, both perſons, times and places, till my nex Anſwer comes out againſt him, and ſhall now inſtance only in one Pamphlet lately ſet forth by <note n="*" place="margin">This Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſpoken and beleeved by all to be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

by his diſcourſe in the Pulpit it was carried in ſuch a way, as under the Malignant ſtriking at the Presbyterian party, who oppoſed Sectaries: In this Sermon he ſpake alſo of the Army to this effect, that when hee thought of the Army, and the carriage of men to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, hee thought of Jeſus Chriſt, how like they were to him, that as he went about doing good and working miracles, and at length the people crucified him, ſo will men do with this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.

<pb n="123" facs="tcp:113943:88"/>
was this, that a man may be a great man in place, power, and yet a graceleſſe man; and in the latter part of his Text and Sermon, he fel upon ſpeaking of <hi>Gamaliels</hi> giving that counſel, <hi>Refrain from theſe men and let them alone,</hi> and there he called him good <hi>Gama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liel,</hi> honeſt <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> wiſe <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> with many words to that purpoſe, ſaying, <q>I profeſſe I had rather live under <hi>Gamaliels</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment then any I know of; where ſhall a man read of ſuch a man? I had rather live under <hi>Gamaliels</hi> Government, then un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any of the Presbyterians. And in his pleading for Liberty</q> of conſcience upon thoſe words of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> one of his Arguments againſt all reſtraint was, becauſe we the Engliſh Nation naturally above others were given to change, and did not love to be held to any thing; in a few years we turned foure or five times, we were Papiſts in <hi>Henry</hi> the eights dayes, Proteſtants in King <hi>Edwards</hi> dayes, Papiſts in Quene <hi>Marys</hi> dayes, Proteſtants again in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> raigne.

reduce to that Praedicament, and draw all the lines to that cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, clearly ſhewing 'tis for the advancing of that party; which that he may do the man cares not what hee writes; but inſtead of a faire, full, open, true Relation of things, he writes very partially in ſome things, falſly in other things, hypocritically and doubly in moſt; and were I at leaſure to write Animadverſions on every line of this Pamphlet, and give a full Anſwer to it, laying one thing to another, I could diſcover many myſteries of iniquity in it, and ſhew it to be exceeding pernicious both to Church and State, and very prejudiciall to the League and Union between the Kingdomes, and ſuch a peece of Politicks, that in this juncture of things, an Arch-Jeſuite if he were imployed to write, would make much ſuch another. I ſhall give ſome inſtances.</p>
               <p>Firſt, his Relation of <hi>Worceſter</hi> buſineſſe is very partiall, much wronging that gallant Gentleman, Col. <hi>Whaley,</hi> giving the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of reducing <hi>Worceſter</hi> to others, who hath deſerved better at the hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> and ſome others, then to be ſo ſerved. This Gentleman did very great ſervice at <hi>Naſeby</hi> Field; this Gentleman reduced that ſtrong Caſtle of <hi>Banbury,</hi> beſides many other gallant ſervices that he hath done; but becauſe he is a Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian, and an Antilibertine; therefore others who never did that worke at <hi>Worceſter,</hi> nor in <hi>Naſeby</hi> Field, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> muſt have the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his labours, and muſt enter upon them, reaping that which hee hath ſowed with much faithfulneſſe, valour, hazards. The relation of this buſineſſe of <hi>Worceſter</hi> is ſo partiall (thats the beſt can be ſaid of it) that I have been informed from perſons of much worth and truſt, that when Col. <hi>Whaley</hi> read it, he went to a great Commander of the Army, ſpeaking to this purpoſe, do you not ſee how <hi>Peters</hi> hath abuſed and wronged me, and ſhall he be ſuffer'd? well, if I meet him, I will cane him ſoundly; and a Commander of the Army told in ſome company to a Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Colonell, a great Sectary, that he had heard, Colonell <hi>Whaley</hi> wherever he met Maſter <hi>Peters,</hi> would cane him, if not cut him, for his relation of <hi>Worceſter</hi> buſineſſe.</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſpeaking of Schiſmaticks and Opinioniſts, he inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in Anabaptiſts, and calls them <hi>the harmeleſſe Anabaptiſts,</hi> which is a falſe Epithite given to them; for what Sect or fort of men ſince the Reformation this hundred years have been more harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full;

ſurely Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> cannot but have read or at leſt heard of the Tumults, Wars, Tragedies, Out-rages, Rapes, raiſed and committed by the Anabaptiſts in ſeverall parts of Chriſtendome, eſpecially in <hi>Germany</hi> and <hi>M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

Are they harmleſſe who in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Baptiſme have piſſed in the Font, have fecht a horſe into the Church and baptiz'd it? Who aſſault with violence godly Miniſters, put them out of their Pulpits by force, openly affront them, and invade their Pulpits whether they will or no: Who make tumults and riots in Countries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who kill tender young perſons and ancient with dipping them all over in Rivers, in the depth of Winter: Who give out that they will never lay down their ſwords whilſt ther's a Prieſt in <hi>England:</hi> Who write and print libells, full ſtuffed with invectives and ſeditious ſpeeches againſt the Right Honourable Houſe of Peers, undoubtedly a Court of Record, the higheſt Court of Iudicature in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: Who make wicked libells and ſpread them abroad of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men, and perſons of great place by name, as that religious and Noble Earle of <hi>Mancheſtor,</hi> the Lord Major of <hi>London,</hi> a whole Kingdome, as <hi>Scotland,</hi> and a whole City, as <hi>London:</hi> Who have endeavored and do by all wayes to involve theſe Kingdomes into a new War, more deadly and deſtructive then the former.

them, and ſpeake ſo favourably of them, as he hath done, and doth here? I am of the mind if any man ſhould have told him fifteen, or ſeven years agoe, Maſter <hi>Peters,</hi> the time ſhall come, that you ſhall live in a Kingdome where all damnable Hereſies and wicked doctrines ſhall be vented, by printing, preaching, and you ſhall be ſo farre from ſeeking to ſuppreſſe and hinder them, as that you ſhall make nothing of them, preach for a Toleration of them, cry them up for Saints who hold them, plot, act, ride, work night and day for the upholding of them; he would have been very angry, boiſterous, and have ſaid, as <hi>Hazael</hi> to the Prophet, <hi>Am I a dog that I ſhould do theſe things?</hi> nay, I am ſo well perſwaded of Mr <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> that he was ſo farre fifteen years agoe from being of theſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions and running theſe wayes, that I am confident 'tis but a few years agoe ſince he is fallen thus; and that the two things that have poyſoned him, are his being in the Army, and his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with ſome wicked Politicians of theſe times, who upon mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of worldly intereſt, being men of ſmall and broken eſtates, that they may be great and the Heads of a great party, counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and patronize all kind of abominable Sectaries; not caring what becomes of Religion, and who propheſies falſly, ſo they may beare rule by that meanes.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Speaking of turning his cheek to the ſmiter, hee ſaith with <hi>Jeremy,</hi> though he neither borrowes nor lends, &amp;c. yet this may be his portion: Now I wonder he can ſay ſo, when a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> his hand hath been againſt every man, medling with all ſorts of men, a Polupragmaticall, medling in the Armies with many, abuſing the Common Councell and the City of <hi>London,</hi> the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, the Reformed Churches, our Brethren of <hi>Scotland,</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees, the King and his children, and indeed who not: I could name particular perſons of both Houſes of whom he hath ſpoken his pleaſure, who have deſerved a great deale better of him.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, There is an unjuſt and ſcandalous paſſage, pag. 11. reflecting upon the City and their Remonſtrance, as if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated about their wills, and not about things needfull, and juſt grievances; and as if the increaſe of the plague upon the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were for any neglect towards the Parliament; whereas I would have Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> know and all his party, the City of <hi>London</hi> could not do leſſe, and have but done their duty; the

Reformed Churches, <hi>Scotland,</hi> the body of this Kingdome, and all who are not Independents and Independentiſh, doe bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the faithfulneſſe of this City to the cauſe of God and the Parliament; and this Remonſtrance was ſo farre from being a matter of meer will (as Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> words import) that I am of the mind, and I beleeve not alone in it, that it will never be well with <hi>England,</hi> till the City of <hi>London,</hi> the Miniſtry of the Kingdome, and all the Counties as one man make a plainer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance, in a more particular way and manner, of all the growing miſchiefs and abominations in Church and Common-wealth, deſiring a ſpeedy and effectuall redreſſe of them. And as for his hinting the cauſe of the increaſe of the plague to come from the City Remonſtrance, or want of the Cities full conſent to a match with the Parliament, I dare boldly ſay of him, in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>o ſaying, He is a falſe Prophet, a dreamer of dreams, ſpeaking the viſions of his own heart, and declaring falſe burdens; and do offer from the word of God to make it good againſt Maſter <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> that if the City of <hi>London</hi> would oftner Remonſtrate and Petition in this kind, and uſe the power they have by their Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and the Lawes in force, to puniſh Hereticks and Sectaries, and diſturb their meetings, the plague would ſooner be removed from them.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, That alſo is a falſe and untrue Aſſertion, That the <q>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Army is onely to obey their Maſters the Parliament; the ſlighting the Army is their money, triumphant chariots would have broke our necks, underſtood in Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> ſenſe, <hi>viz.</hi> of</q> that part of the Army the Sectaries; for if it were ſo as he ſpeak<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And if the ſlighting of the Army is their

And for triumphant chariots, there have been men on purpoſe employed to provide them triumphant cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riots weekly, to carry them throughout the Kingdom, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign parts, in the weekly newes books, wherein they have been lifted up to heaven in praiſes, reports of victories, other mens valiant acts attributed to them, and they upon all occaſions plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for, excuſed, and fair gloſſes put upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, For Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> leaving his Profeſſorſhip in <hi>Frizland</hi> to live with Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> at <hi>Roterdam,</hi> I will not deny that, but I doe deny that it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his Churches Independency; it was upon other reaſons, and of this I can give the Reader ſome good account: (and I muſt acknowledge it as a providence of God, that I many years agoe by reaſon of my intimate acquaintance with the eminenteſt and godlieſt men of thoſe times, and with the prime of thoſe who are now turned Independents, did hear and know many things of all ſorts of godly men, both at home and abroad, in <hi>Holland, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, New-England,</hi> which I then little thought I ſhould ever have had any uſe of, but ſince have been, and are of great uſe in anſwering Independents, when they come and tell the world ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of themſelves, which men know not how to diſprove them:) Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> (as I have been told from grave godly Miniſters) for many years before he died was weary of his place in <hi>Frizland,</hi> and would fain have had ſome place in <hi>England;</hi> he moved and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it to ſome, that if he could but have any living or place to preach in (though in a remote Village) without uſing the Ceremonies and being put upon ſubſcription, he would take it, for he had a mind to give himſelf to preaching, and to enjoy the ſociety of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chriſtians and Miniſters, and was weary be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of that dulneſſe and different way, in regard of the practicall power of godlineſſe he found among thoſe he lived with there, and the godly <hi>Engliſh,</hi> whom he in the former part of his life had been acquainted with; and therefore divers years before there was any thought or ſpeech of Independent Churches or this way, he moved for a place in <hi>England,</hi> and would faine have left his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſorſhip in <hi>Frizeland:</hi> And I am ready to depoſe I have been told this by one or more godly Miniſters of great note. 'Tis ſufficiently known I was well acquainted with Doctor <hi>Preſton,</hi> Doctor <hi>Sibs,</hi> Maſter <hi>Bouls</hi> Doctor <hi>Preſtons</hi> Tutor, Doctor <hi>Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,</hi> Doctor <hi>Staughton,</hi> &amp;c. and from ſome of theſe I had it; and I remember I have been in company with Doctor <hi>Ames,</hi> at Doctor <hi>Preſtons</hi> lodging, who after the death of King <hi>James,</hi> coming to <hi>England,</hi> and to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> I heard him preach there,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:113943:99"/>
and well remember the Sermon and Text, <hi>Jude,</hi> verſ. 20, 21. but times in <hi>England</hi> growing worſe and worſe, there being no hope for ſuch a man as he here, being weary of his Profeſſorſhip in <hi>Frizland,</hi> was willing to be Miniſter of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Church in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> ſince he could not obtain it in <hi>England;</hi> and I make no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if Doctor <hi>Ames</hi> could have been aſſured of a comfortable place for people and maintenance in <hi>England,</hi> without Ceremonies and Subſcription, he would have taken a Pariſh Church in <hi>England,</hi> before he would have gone to Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> at <hi>Roterdam;</hi> but if upon his coming to <hi>Roterdam</hi> there was any ſuch change (as Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Peters</hi> ſpeaks of) that he was really turned to be an Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and of the Church-way, and would have carried on that way with Maſter <hi>Peters,</hi> it was the mercy of God to him to take him away juſt upon his removing, and new coming to <hi>Roterdam,</hi> before he had appeared actually engaged in that way, or writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten for it; becauſe his name and authority, being a learned man, might have ſwayed the more with many; and we ſee Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> makes uſe of his name to credit that cauſe thirteen years after, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that he died upon the borders and entrance into it, before any notice was ever taken by the Reformed Churches of any ſuch thing; though I much queſtion whether or no in his latter time there was any ſuch change as Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> ſpeaks of.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> writes many things hypocritically, which he and his party neither practices, nor intends; but a ſnake lies under the green graſſe, as that of a door open for the Goſpel, and of Itinerary Miniſters in a County three or foure, which is for no other end but to leaven the whole Kingdome with Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, and to fore-ſtall Presbytery from being ſetled; as that of almoſt loſt liberty, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> being ruled by love, as cautions about a new ſlavery, and wiſhes of all marks of ſlavery to be taken off, when as 'tis evident he and his party mean by liberty, a free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to hold what they will, and to be under no Church-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and that he and his party are the greateſt means in all places for keeping up all thoſe things, which the people have uſed to account marks of ſlavery, and againſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> liberty; as that of walking plainly in your Councells; God preſerveth the ſimple, as ſpeaking againſt <hi>Arcana Imperii,</hi> deep-ſet counſells of men, &amp;c. whereas he and his party have and doe practiſe quite

There is one Maſter <hi>Feake</hi> an Independent named in <hi>page</hi> 81. of this Book, of whom becauſe when I writ that ſheet I had not my full profe of particulars as I deſired, I paſſed him over lightly till another time, but having ſince received full and particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of him, I think at good to pay my debt of promiſe ſooner then I made account of: This Maſter <hi>Feake</hi> within this twelve months was Preacher in <hi>London,</hi> and hath preached many ſtrange and odd things at <hi>Peters</hi> in <hi>Cornhill,</hi> beſides <hi>Wool-Church,</hi> and other places, as for ſeparation from our Aſſemblies, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing many heterodox things about mixed Communion at the Lords Supper, againſt maintenance of Miniſters by Tythes; and in Sermons and Prayers hath had many ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

All-Saints;</hi> being put into a Sequeſtrated Living, by the power of ſome of the Independent partie in that Town, without the approbation of the Aſſembly, having never been with the Aſſembly; according to the Order of the Honour. Houſe of Commons, nor with the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Plundred Miniſters neither, (as I beleeve) who uſe to ſend thoſe that come to them for Sequeſtrated Livings to the Aſſembly, before they grant them power and intereſt in ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. As for his carriage at <hi>Hartford,</hi> where he hath preached ſince laſt <hi>January,</hi> it hath been as followes. His preaching and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhewes him no friend to the Aſſembly nor to the Directory: he hath never uſed the Lords Prayer ſince he came thither, but hath preached againſt the uſe of it as a prayer. 'Tis obſerved of him by underſtanding men his Auditors, that they never heard him appoint or ſing a Pſalme, he reades but one Chapter or a peece of a Chapter; he hath not baptized any ſince his coming. One of the Committee, a Juſtice of Peace, put up ſome Articles againſt him at the Aſſizes at <hi>Hartford,</hi> to both Judges then on the Bench; The firſt was this That Chriſt would deſtroy not only unlawfull Government, but lawfull Government, not only the abuſe, but the <note place="margin">☜</note> uſe of it; and as he had begun to deſtroy it in <hi>England,</hi> ſo would he by raiſing combuſtions in the bowells of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine;</hi> and that he would deſtroy <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> for Tolerating Arminianiſme: When he denyed the words, one being preſent, and asked, affirmed him to have preached thus; and there are
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:113943:101"/>
foure others, underſtanding men and of good worth will teſtifie the ſame. Then Maſter <hi>Feake</hi> explained himſelf before the Judges, that there was in <hi>Monarchie</hi> and <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> an enmity againſt Chriſt, which he would deſtroy; and as he was ſpeaking ſome turbulent fellowes and Sectaries, clambred up by the Bench, and cryed out my Lord, my Lord, Mr <hi>Pr.</hi> doth it in malice, we will main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine our Miniſter with our bloud; whereupon the Judge threw away the paper, and ſaid he would heare no more of it, though he had before commanded Maſter <hi>Eldred,</hi> to read openly all thoſe Heterodoxies. The Lords day following, Maſter <hi>Feake</hi> in the Pulpit endeavored to anſwer all the Articles put up againſt him to the Judges, in a great Auditory. Many other things I have heard of him ſince his coming to <hi>Hartford;</hi> but what I here ſet down of him, beſides the relation I have had by word of mouth of perſons of worth, 'tis given me under hand in writing, and that with this ſeale ſet to it, what I have here written I will juſtifie, and much more when I am called to it.</p>
               <p>There is one <hi>Richard Overton</hi> a deſperate Sectary, one of <hi>Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnes</hi> Breed and followers, who hath printed many ſcandalous things againſt the Houſe of Peers, and notice being given of him, there was an Order granted for the taking of him, and ſeaſing of his Preſſe (a Preſſe that had printed many wicked Pamphlets, that have come out of late, againſt the King, the Lords, the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall Government, the City, and for a Toleration, and Liberty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive to all Religion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Lawes and Government, yea overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the principles laid down in them, the <note n="*" place="margin">This is fully proved in the firſt ſheet of this <hi>Gangrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> and in ſome ſheets following this.</note> power of the Houſe of Commons, whilſt they ſeeme to cry up and inveſt that Houſe with the Monopoly of all the power of the Kingdome) who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehended by the Meſſengers ſent out for him, was brought before a Committee of the Houſe of Lords, where he refuſed to anſwer any queſtions, and carried himſelf with a great deale of contempt and ſcorne, both in words and geſture; and after this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought before the Houſe of Lords, he refuſed to anſwer any queſtions propounded by the Speaker as in the name of the Houſe, and to that queſtion, whether he were a Printer or no, hee would not anſwer, but told them he was reſolved not to make anſwer to any interrogatories that ſhould infringe his propertie, right or freedome in particular, or the rights, freedomes, and properties

countenanced by too many, the power and priviledge of the Houſe of Commons would be overthrowne and cut ſhort, as well as the Kings and Lords: For inſtance, (to ſay nothing of that, that the Commons power is not only by being choſen by the ſeverall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Townes, but by the vertue of Writs under the Great Seal, and by vertue of Lawes and Rules, according to which the ſeverall Electors muſt goe, or elſe their Elections give them no power at all;) If this Principle were true, the Houſe of Commons ſhould have no power over me, nor over many thouſands more in the Kingdome, and we might all ſay the ſame things to the Houſe of Commons, which <hi>Lilburne, Overton,</hi> and all the Sectaries ſay to the Houſe of Lords; for we never choſe them, had no voyces in their Elections, they are not our choſen ones, as the Sectaries ſay of the Lords; I and many Miniſters of the Kingdome, with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſands of people who have not ſo much free land <hi>per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num,</hi> are excluded from election of Knights of the Shires, and not being free-men of Towns, have no voyces in choyce of Burgeſſes, and ſo may refuſe ſubjection to their Orders, reſiſt their Officers who come with their Warrants, and refuſe to live by the Lawes they make, as not being choſen by us, who no queſtion are the greateſt number of perſons in the Kingdom; (I beleeve there are more men of years of underſtanding without ſo much free land <hi>per annum,</hi> then there are thoſe who have ſo much:) Beſides, if this Principle were true, That all ſubjection and obedience to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and their Lawes ſtood by vertue of electing them, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides all non-free-holders exempted from the Juriſdiction of the Houſe of Commons, all women at once were exempt from being under Government, and all youths who were under age at the beginning of this Parliament ſix years ago (though now men) and had no voyces in the choyce of Parliament men; yea, if this Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ſit many years longer, all thoſe who were boyes and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when they come to years of underſtanding muſt be exempt too, as having had no voyces in election; nay yet further, ſo weak a Principle this is, upon which the Sectaries would overthrow all the power of the King and Lords, and give all power to the Commons, that if it were true, none were bound to any obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of thoſe Knights and Burgeſſes whom they choſe not, but oppoſed with all their might, ſo that by this rule all Free-holders

               <p>There is one <hi>John Price</hi> an Exchange man, <hi>Cretenſis</hi> beloved Diſciple, and one of his Prophets; who among others preach for him, when he hath any Book to Anſwer, or ſome Libertine Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctate to ſet forth; This man hath put forth three Pamphlets, one about Independencies, the other two Replyes or Anſwers; one to the City Remonſtrane, the other to a Vindication of the Remonſtrance; in all which he ſhewes himſelf to be Schollar to <hi>Cretenſis,</hi> and ſomewhat allyed to <hi>Lilburne, Overton,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe Sectaries, who give all the ſupreame power of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to the Houſe of Commons: For in his City Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance Remonſtrated, and in his moderate Reply he is againſt the City Remonſtrance, for giving only a ſhare of the ſupreame power to the Houſe of Commons, and inſtead of three Eſtates the <note n="*" place="margin">City Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance Remonſtrated. pag. 23, 24, 25, 26.</note> King, Lords, and Commons, of which the fundamentall Conſtitution of the Government of this Kingdome is made up, he holds there is but one, and that the Commons, for which hee gives his Reaſons (ſuch as they be) and puts Queres to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

of the Juſtification of the City Remonſtrance; their ſcope being all along, to give the whole ſupreame power, and not only a part to the Commons. Certainly theſe Books of Maſter <hi>Price</hi> were not written in the yeare 1645. but in the yeare 1646. that they agree ſo with <hi>Lilburne, Overton,</hi> &amp;c. And if I ſhould uſe his Maſter <hi>Goodwins</hi> Argument againſt him here, I wonder how hee would anſwer it; <q>Thoſe who are choſen by the generality of the Land, Worldlings, drunkards, uncleane perſons are not fit to have the whole ſupreame power of the Kingdome, and neither King, nor Lords to have any part with them. But ſo are the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</q> of <hi>England</hi> choſen. <hi>Ergo.</hi> Now both the <hi>major</hi> and the <hi>minor</hi> are his Tutor <hi>Goodwins,</hi> only the <hi>major</hi> is ſtronger as I put it; for if according to Maſter <hi>Goodwin,</hi> becauſe they are choſen by the Common people, and not only by Saints, they are uncapable of a part of the ſupreame power, becauſe there is an impoſſibility of a ſpirituall extraction out of a ſecular root; then much more ſhould they not have the whole ſupreame power. And as this man is bold with the power of the King and Lords to exchange it, and give it to the Commons, ſo he is with the City, the Court of Common-Councell, calling the City Remonſtrance made by the Common-Councell, <hi>the diſturber of the quiet and peace of the Church and State,</hi> &amp;c.

               <p>There is one Maſter <hi>Cradock</hi> who came out of <hi>Wales,</hi> and is going thither again to be an Itinerary Preacher whom I have ſpoken of in <hi>page</hi> 131. that hee declined coming to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, but now lately <hi>October</hi> 14. ſeeing the pay could not be had without the concurrence of the Lords, and in all this time having made ſome leading men his friends, hee came to be examined and is paſſed; but beſides that he hath gathered a Church, admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring the Lords Supper in a houſe at evening, he hath preached many odd things in the City, ſtraines tending to Antinomia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſme, Libertiniſme, as ſpeaking againſt men of an old Teſtament ſpirit, and how poore Drunkards and Adulterers could not look into one of our Churches but hell fire muſt be flaſhed in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. That if a Saint ſhould commit a groſſe ſinne, and upon the committing of it ſhould be ſtartled at it, that would be a great ſinne in him. And now lately this <hi>October,</hi> or at the latter end of <hi>September,</hi> he preached on that Text in <hi>Thames-ſtreet, Wee are not of the night, but of the day;</hi> upon which Text he delivered matter to this effect, that ſince the Apoſtles times, or preſently after them, there had been a great night, but now the day was breaking out after a long night, and light was coming every day more then other; and there were many Goſpel priviledges, and of the new <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> that we ſhould then enjoy: In that day there ſhould be no Ordinances to puniſh men for holding opinions, there ſhould be no Confeſſions of Faith, there every one ſhould have the liberty of their conſciences, then as in <hi>Micah</hi> 'tis propheſied of thoſe Goſpel times, <hi>All people will walke every one in the name of his God, and wee will walke every one in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever,</hi> which place was brought for liberty of conſcience by him; And in that day neither Epiſcopacy nor Presbytery, nor any others ſhould intermeddle, or invade the rights of the Saints; many ſuch flings he had; and this Sermon was preached juſt upon that time when the Ordinance againſt Hereſies was taken into de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and the Confeſſion of Faith to be brought into the Houſe of Commons, ſo that by theſe and many more particulars, his hints about dipping often and ſuffering ſuch, ſhewes what the firſt fruits of theſe Itinerary Preachers are, and what a ſad

               <p>Maſter <hi>Sympſon</hi> the Independent, preaching preſently after the ſecond part of <hi>Gangraena</hi> came forth, at <hi>Black-Friars</hi> on <hi>June</hi> 12. (as 'tis given me under ones hand) and in his Sermon diſcourſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Angels bringing no railing accuſation againſt Satan, he adviſed his people how to behave themſelves at this time now the Saints infirmities were laid open; Firſt, not anſwer a word, as the King of <hi>Judah</hi> commanded thoſe he ſent to <hi>Rabſhakeh.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, to pray againſt them, yea and to pray againſt them by name, for God would avenge them.</p>
               <p>Reader take notice of the charity and love of Independents <note place="margin">Animadverſ.</note> to their Presbyterian Brethren, to ſtirre up the people to pray againſt them, and that by name, with giving them an incourrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Gods avenging, which I never read was practiſed by the Primitive Church, but only againſt <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, whom the Church judged with one conſent to have ſinned againſt the Holy Ghoſt. Theſe Independents and Sectaries did in many Books before my firſt part of <hi>Gangraena</hi> came forth, name many Presbyterian godly Miniſters, and others, laying open infirmities committed long before, yea abuſing Members of both Houſes, and worthy perſons, by writing lyes and falſe things of them, as that religious and Noble Earle of <hi>Mancheſter,</hi> Maſter <hi>Pryn,</hi> Colonell <hi>King,</hi> Maſter <hi>Calamy,</hi> with many more; and have abuſed by name in printed Books lately many able and godly Miniſters of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, as Maſter <hi>Vines,</hi> Maſter <hi>Marſhall,</hi> Maſter <hi>Sedgwick,</hi> Maſter <hi>Gataker,</hi> Maſter <hi>Ley,</hi> Maſter <hi>Newcomen,</hi> Maſter <hi>Seaman,</hi> Maſter <hi>Hill,</hi> Doctor <hi>Burges,</hi> with ſome City Miniſters; and this is no fault in the Sectaries, neither are theſe worthy men, Saints be like in the Independent Kalender, nor may the Presbyterians I hope pray againſt Maſter <hi>Saltmarſh, Cretenſis, Lilburne,</hi> and others of them by name; but for Maſter <hi>Edwards</hi> becauſe he hath written of the damnable Errors, Hereſies, and Blaſphemies of theſe times, and the better to preſerve the people, and to make them take heed, hath given the names of ſome of the prime ſeducers, <hi>Wrighter, Erbury, Hich, Wallwyn, Denne, Kiſſin, Lambe, Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne,</hi> &amp;c. not Saints in his Creed, nor their opinions and wayes,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:113943:109"/>
infirmities, but deliberated, plotted abominations, therefore hee muſt be prayed againſt, and that by name; and as Maſter <hi>Sympſon</hi> gives him his bleſſing, ſo his Brother <hi>Borroughs</hi> preſently after the coming forth of the <hi>Antapologie,</hi> preaching at <hi>Cornhill,</hi> was ſpeaking of ſome that laid open the infirmities of the Saints, and that raked up Letters, ſtories, and all to bring out againſt the Saints; but of ſuch (ſaith he) I will ſay no more, but as <hi>Michael</hi> the Archangell <hi>the Lord rebuke thee;</hi> which in the carriage of the paſſage, and way of expreſſion was ſo evidently againſt me, that (I beleeve) of godly Miniſters and Chriſtians twenty told me of it; and they ſaid many who heard him, ſpoke of it, and ſaid it was a poor thing of Maſter <hi>Burroughs</hi> to ſpeak ſo in the Pulpit, he ſhould do well to anſwer the Book. Now as for the prayers of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries againſt me and their curſes, I would have them know, that though I am ſorry for them they ſhould do ſo, yet I feare not their curſes, but well underſtand that when they curſe, <hi>God will bleſſe,</hi> and that <hi>the curſe cauſeleſſe ſhall not come, Prov.</hi> 26. 2. beſides I know, in this very thing I have more with me then againſt me, and in many Countries of this Kingdome both North and Weſt, I am aſſured from godly Miniſters and Citizens, who have been with me, that I am in an eſpeciall manner prayed for, and many thanks given to God in my behalf for enabling me, and ſtirring me up to this work againſt the Sectaries.</p>
               <p>There is a godly Miniſter of <hi>Cheſhire</hi> who was lately in <hi>London;</hi> that related with a great deale of confidence this following ſtory as a moſt certaine truth known to many of that County, that this laſt Summer the Church of <hi>Duckingfield</hi> (of which Maſter <hi>Eaton</hi> and Maſter <hi>Taylor</hi> are Paſtor and Teacher) being met in their Chappell to the performing of their worſhip and ſervice, as Maſter <hi>Eaton</hi> was preaching, there was heard the perfect ſound as of a man beating a martch on a drum, and it was heard as coming into the Chappell, and then as going up all along the Ile through the people, and ſo about the Chappell, but nothing ſeen, which Maſter <hi>Eaton</hi> preaching and the people that ſate in the ſeverall parts of the Chappell heard, inſomuch that it terrified Maſter <hi>Eaton</hi> and the people, cauſed him to give over preaching, and fall to praying, but the martch ſtill beating, they broke up their exerciſe for that time, and were glad to be gone.</p>

A godly and underſtanding young man told me that a Quarter-Maſter belonging to a Regiment of horſe, coming up into a Pulpit to preach, prepared the Country people for his Sermon, by ſaying they ſhould not wonder to ſee a man in ſuch a habit to preach, for he had a command from the Spirit to preach, and he was under the command of the Spirit, and muſt do accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, <note place="margin">☞</note> and told them though they might ſay he was no Scholar, yet that was no matter, for the Spirit without learning could en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a man to the work.</p>
               <p>A Gentleman of good underſtanding told me lately before o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther company, that he meeting with a Captaine of horſe belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Cromwells</hi> Regiment (as 'tis commonly calld) with whom he rid ſome miles, and dined alſo at the Sheafe in <hi>Daintry</hi> the laſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> this Captain told him, that the Parliament and <hi>Scots</hi> were agreed (that was the newes) of delivering up the King to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Poyns,</hi> who was with his forces to convay him as farre as <hi>Trent,</hi> or thereabouts, and then <hi>Cromwells</hi> Regiment was to bring him up to <hi>London</hi> to ſee him ſafe convayed to the Parliament, and if he would not ſigne the Propoſitions, then he ſaid the Parliament would decoll him, and thus they will decoll him, acting with his hand in putting it to his own neck, in away of cutting off; and this Captain added further, that he thought it would never be well with this Kingdome till the King was ſerved ſo. This man in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſpeaking of Presbyteriall Government, ſaid it was a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred times worſe then Epiſcopall.

                  <hi>Cromwells</hi> Regiment, quartering in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> would not ſuffer the Miniſters to preach quietly, but affronted them; among others one Maſter <hi>H.</hi> a godly Miniſter going to his Cure, one <hi>S.</hi> a Trooper who quartered in that Town, pleaded that Jeſuites ſhould have their liberty of Conſcience as well as other men; and in the afternoon when this Miniſter had done preaching, ſtood up in the open Church, ſpeaking to the people, pretending as to queſtion ſome things delivered, but indeed fell upon venting to the people the doctrine of Univerſall Grace, that no man was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for any thing but unbeleef; whereupon Maſter <hi>H.</hi> ſpake to him, why do you not ſpeak to ſomewhat which I preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as you pretended? upon that this Trooper ſaid, I accept againſt that you preached for ſaying we might not queſtion God, but where he hath given us a word for ſuch a thing, we muſt beleeve it without queſtioning him; to whom Maſter <hi>H.</hi> replyed, if you will queſtion God, you may well queſtion me. I was told at the ſame time by one who came out of <hi>Northamtonſhire,</hi> that one of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctarian ſouldiers laid his hand on his ſword, and ſaid, this ſword ſhould never be laid down, nor many thouſands more, whilſt there was a Prieſt left in <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have been told it by ſeverall that in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> ſome of the Sectarian ſouldiers being in company with a young Scholar, a godly Miniſters ſonne in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> one Maſter <hi>Smith,</hi> and venting ſome of their opinions he reaſoning againſt them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like putting them to <hi>non-plus,</hi> they wounded him terribly, ſo that it was thought he could not live, yea it was feared hee was dead already.</p>
               <p>A worthy Member of the Houſe of Commons told me at the latter end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt, that Letters were written out of <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> from ſome perſons in place there, to Members of the Houſe of Commons, complaining that the ſouldiers who billited there carried themſelves ſo ill, as that if they continued there, they could not ſerve them, but muſt leave the Country; for they infuſe ſuch poyſonous opinions againſt all Government, and perſons of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, as that none of us ſhall be regarded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 12. I was certainly informed from eare witneſſes, that a few dayes before, two very godly and underſtanding men well known, had diſcourſe with a Captaine belonging to Colonell
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:113943:114"/>
                  <hi>Hammonds</hi> Regiment, who poſitively maintained and affirmed theſe things to them, ſpeaking them often as his opinion, and the reſt of the Army of his way, That the Houſe of Commons was the Parliament of <hi>England</hi> and not only a part of it; That if this Houſe of Commons ſhould give any Order for them to go fight with the <hi>Scots,</hi> they would go; That if the Houſe of Commons ſhould give order to come againſt the City of <hi>London,</hi> they would do it; and he ſpake of the City of <hi>London</hi> with much deteſtation, ſaying, hee was perſwaded the City of <hi>London</hi> hated that Army, with other words to that effect; This Captaine asked them, if they heard not of the plot to deſtroy the Army, to ſend part of them into <hi>Ireland,</hi> to be there cut off (ſo the ſending of forces into <hi>Ireland</hi> was interpreted.) This Captaine to another honeſt man, either the ſame day, or within a few dayes maintained the ſame things in ſubſtance, ſo that one of them telling a Colonell belonging to the Army what this Captaine had ſaid, that upon an order of the Houſe of Commons, they would as willingly fight againſt the City of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Scots,</hi> as ever they did againſt the Cavaleers, the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell anſwered readily, it was no ſuch wonder, for he beleeved it was the ſenſe of a great many in the Army.</p>
               <p>A perſon of worth who was at the <hi>Bath</hi> this Summer, told me that he had heard Maſter <hi>Saltmarſh,</hi> and Maſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <hi>Del</hi> preach there before the Generall, but never heard them pray for forgivneſſe of ſinnes; and ſaid he was glad he had heard them, that he might know what manner of men they were.</p>
               <p>It hath been told me by two or three of the Town of <hi>Wantwich</hi> in <hi>Barkſhire,</hi> that at a Town neer <hi>Wantwich,</hi> and in <hi>Wantwich</hi> a great Market Town, a Sectary belonging to the Army, preached in the Pariſh Churches; one of the Texts upon which he preached was out of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> where he ſpake much of Antichriſt, and that all thoſe were Antichriſtian who were for childrens Baptiſme, and that none could be ſaved unleſſe they were rebaptized. The man when he had done preaching at <hi>Wantwich,</hi> ſpoke to the people, and deſired them to object what they could againſt his Sermon, and he would anſwer them; he did not bid them come to his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to be ſatisfied as many would, but he was publikly ready to anſwer any objections made againſt what he had preached.</p>
               <p>There is a very honeſt man of Maſter <hi>Whitakers</hi> Pariſh in <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mondſeyſtreet</hi>
                  <pb n="175" facs="tcp:113943:114"/>
told me, that one <hi>Marſhall</hi> of that Pariſh a great Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctary, refuſing to pay his Tyths, according to the Ordinance of Parliament, was queſtioned, and upon proof before three Juſtices of Peace was adjudged to pay it, but not paying for all this, two godly men, Maſter <hi>W.</hi> and he (who told me this ſtory) came to demand it, or elſe diſtraine, whereupon he calld theſe honeſt men robbers and theifs, and ſaid the Parliament made an Ordinance to rob men, which being complained of and proved, this <hi>Marſhall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">☜</note> was committed. Now when he was committed, <hi>Lilburne</hi> aſſiſted him in his buſineſſe, came to this honeſt man who related to me the ſtory, to ſee the Warrant, by vertue of which they proceeded to diſtraine; and in fine this <hi>Marſhall</hi> arreſted the Juſtices of Peace <note place="margin">☜</note> (who went according to the Ordinance) and the Diſtrainers, but at laſt being brought before the Committee of Examinations, he promiſed to withdraw his action, and ſaid, he ſpake thoſe words in his paſſion; and yet ſince his promiſe, hath renewed his ſuite, and the Juſtices and Diſtrainers are now troubled by him.</p>
               <p>A godly Miniſter of this City told me <hi>June</hi> 12. 1646. that he diſcourſing with a Major belonging to the Army about the Government of the Church, he told him plainly that they were not ſo much againſt Presbyteriall Government (though many thought them ſo) as againſt the being tyed to any Government at all; for if the Parliament would ſet up the Independent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and injoyne that upon them, they ſhould be as much againſt <note place="margin">☜</note> that as againſt Presbyteriall Government: They held liberty of Conſcience, that no man ſhould be bound, or tyed to any thing, but every man left free to hold what they pleaſed; that was the judgement and true genius of that ſort of men in the Army, calld Independents, that in all matters of Religion no man ſhould be bound, but every one left to follow his own Conſcience.</p>
               <p>There is a libellous Pamphlet entituled, <hi>The Lord Majors far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well from his Office of Majoraltie,</hi> which was ſent to him in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by an Anabaptiſt, one of the meek and quiet of the earth, as he often calls himſelf and his fellowes in that Pamphlet, and coming to my Lords hands over-night, next day he heard that it was in print; the ſubſtance of which Pamphlet is to charge my Lord Major with breach of promiſe, in not endeavoring to procure of the Parliament, a publike diſputation between the Anabaptiſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

and the Presbyterians, and for preſenting an unjuſt Remonſtrance to the Parliament, for ſuppreſſing both Anabaptiſts and Separatiſts. Now I ſhall ſpeak ſomething to both theſe, and vindicate the truth againſt this lying Libeller. Secondly, I ſhall Animadvert on ſome paſſages and expreſſions in this Pamphlet.</p>
               <p>For the firſt, my Lord Majors breach of promiſe, upon which hee runns out and deſcants, builds this inference among <note place="margin">☞</note> others, <hi>That if Maſter</hi> Edwards <hi>or Doctor</hi> Baſtwick <hi>had any ſuch blot againſt us, doubtleſſe there would be great Volumes of a hundred ſheets a peece blazed throughout the Kingdome to diſgrace us, as your breach of promiſe;</hi> I anſwer breifly, the building muſt needs fall, when as the foundation falls; my Lord Major broke not his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but was very carefull of it, and mindfull of what you ſay hee promiſed, namely, to know the pleaſure of the Parliament, and to endeavour the liberty of a publike diſputation, and my Lord was ſo conſciencious in it, both in regard of God and in regard of men, that he might not be upbraided with breach of promiſe, knowing well what a generation he had to deale with, that he was never at quiet after his promiſe was made, till the Houſe of Commons was moved in the buſineſſe; and therefore every time when he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aw Maſter <hi>Recorder,</hi> he minded him to move the Houſe, he put a note into his hands becauſe he ſhould not forget; when he ſaw him not for ſome time, he writ to him to mind him, and was never content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till it was done; and Maſter <hi>Recorder</hi> did take in his time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome weeks after my Lords promiſe, watching when he might acquaint the Houſe ſeaſonably, without interrupting other great publike occaſions of the Kingdome; and the Houſe of Commons Anſwer was, they approved of the wiſdome of my Lord Major, in forbidding the diſputation at that time, and that they would not give conſent for a diſputation; and for the truth of this, let Maſter <hi>Recorder</hi> be asked, and other Members who were preſent; and therefore Maſter <hi>Recorder</hi> in all places, and to all who ſpeaks to him about it, clears my Lord Major that he punctually performed his promiſe; and if it be any ſuch hainous crime to hinder ſuch a tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous diſputation, as that was like to have been, let them lay the blame upon the Houſe of Commons, if they dare, and not upon the Lord Major. And what I write in this matter, I ſpeak know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, as being aſſured of the truth of it, from the mouth of him
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:113943:115"/>
who ſhould know. But leaſt the Anabaptiſts ſhould think, whilſt I vindicate the truth againſt a ſcandalous reproach caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord Major, I do it out of reſpects as being glad the Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation was put off, and ſince denyed; I here declare my ſelf, that I could wiſh withall my heart there were a publike Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, even in the point of Paedobaptiſme and of Dipping, between ſome of the Anabaptiſts, and ſome of our Miniſters; and had I an intereſt in the Houſes to prevaile to obtaine it (which I ſpeak not as to preſume of any ſuch power, being ſo meane and weak a man) it ſhould be one of the firſt Petitions I would put up to the Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Houſes for a publike Diſputation, as was at <hi>Zurick,</hi> namely, that both Houſes would give leave to the Anabaptiſts to chuſe for themſelves ſuch a number of their ableſt men, and the Aſſembly leave to chuſe an equall number for them, and that by Authority of Parliament publike Notaries ſworne, might be appointed to write down all, ſome Members of both Houſes preſent to ſee to the Peace kept, and to be Judges of the faire play and liberty given the Anabaptiſts, and that there might be ſeverall dayes of Diſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, leave to the utmoſt given the Anabaptiſts to ſay what they could, and if upon ſuch faire and free debates it ſhould be found the Anabaptiſts to be in the Truth, then the Parliament not only to To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate them, but to Eſtabliſh and ſettle their way throughout the whole Kingdome; but if upon Diſputation and debate, the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts ſhould be found in an Error (as I am confident they would) that then the Parliament ſhould forbid all Dipping, and take ſome ſevere courſe with all Dippers, as the Senate of <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Epiſt.</hi> Zuing. &amp; Oecolam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pad. <hi>lib.</hi> z.</note> 
                  <hi>Zurick</hi> did after the ten ſeverall Diſputations allowed the Anabaptiſts.</p>
               <p>For the ſecond particular, my Lord Major is charged with preſenting of an unjuſt Remonſtrance to the Parliament, for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing Anabaptiſts, <hi>&amp;c</hi> I anſwer, my Lord Major preſented it not, hee went not to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> with it, but ſome Aldermen and Common counſell men choſen by the Court: The Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance was the Act of the Court of Common-counſell, and not my Lords Majors alone, nor my Lord Majors any otherwiſe, but as a Member of that Honourable Court concurring with the reſt; and then whereas this Libeller calls it an unjuſt Remonſtrance, 'tis a moſt juſt and equall Remonſtrance, as hath been fully proved by Maſter <hi>Bellamie</hi> in his Juſtification and Vindication of the City
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:113943:116"/>
Remonſtrance, and in that Book entituled <hi>the Sectaries Anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed;</hi> and if I would give liberty to my pen, I could further juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie not only the juſtneſſe of it, but the neceſſity of it, and ſhow demonſtratively, that it will never be well with this Kingdome, whilſt Sectaries are in places of publike truſt, and that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of this Kingdome can never expect juſtice, nor right, whilſt men of other Religions, then what is eſtabliſhed by Law, are in <note place="margin">☞</note> places of power; and I wonder that the Anabaptiſts and Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſhould be ſo offended at that part of the Remonſtrance, when as 'tis their dayly practiſe, not by faire and juſt wayes (God knowes) but by undermining, watching for iniquity, laying ſnares for men; yea going againſt all principles, Military and Civill, of Honour and of Juſtice, to put men from places of Truſt and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, of which there are many remarkable unparalleld inſtances, and the world in due time may have a true account of them.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, whereas 'tis ſaid, <hi>preſenting a Remonſtrance for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Licence and Authority, to ſuppreſſe all ſuch as have good principles and grounds for their practiſes;</hi> thats moſt falſe, for in the ſame Remonſtrance againſt Hereticks, Blaſphemers, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> they petition for the ſetling of Religion and Church-government, according to the word of God, and the example of the beſt Reformed Churches, which Religion, Church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo built, hath certainly good ground for its practiſe. For the ſecond, I deſire the Reader to obſerve a few things upon ſome of the expreſſions in this Pamphlet, that he calls the Anabaptiſts and Sectaries <hi>the meek and quiet of the Land,</hi> as Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> doth, <hi>the harmleſſe Anabaptiſts,</hi> then which that there are not a more turbulent unquiet people in the world, made of <hi>Salt-Peter,</hi> let this Book witneſſe, and the language in it given the cheif Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate of the City, with the railing ſeditious Libells put out dayly againſt the King, Houſe of Lords, Aſſembly, yea and the Houſe of Commons too. The Anabaptiſts of old calld themſelves the meek of the Earth, and ſaid, that now the promiſe muſt be fulfilled, <hi>the meek ſhall inherite the Earth,</hi> when they by bloud, Rapine, cruel Warrs, ſeaſed on the poſſeſſions of others. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that theſe Sectaries will take things for granted, and therupon paſſe deſperate cenſures upon Magiſtrates, Miniſters, and all, when as there is no ſuch thing but quite contrary, as going on
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:113943:116"/>
to aggravate things againſt my Lord Major, and reſemble him to wicked <hi>Ahaz,</hi> &amp;c. for breaking his promiſe, when as he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it moſt punctually and conſcientiouſly, conſidering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf both as a Chriſtian, and as a Magiſtrate, in ſuch an eminent place. Thirdly, that theſe new Anabaptiſts, as well as the old, are guilty of ſpeaking evill of dignities, and bringing railing accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in print againſt Powers, branding the Lord Major with that brand ſet by God himſelf on wicked <hi>Ahaz,</hi> this is that Lord Major of <hi>London, Thomas Adams</hi> by name, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A Citizen a freind of mine having been this laſt ſummer in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and divers other Countries upon his occaſions, heard ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Malignants ſay, they would turne Independents, for then they ſhould not take the Covenant, nor be forced to any thing, but be at their liberty.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>June</hi> the 11. I was told by a godly Citizen, and a cordiall friend to the Publike, that ſome of the Independents have ſaid, they will have their way yet, whatſoever it coſt them.</p>
               <p>In ſome of the weekly news-Books, I have obſerved paſſages in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted of the great love and unity in the Army between the ſouldiers, Presbytery and Independency making no breach; and in the <hi>Perfect Occurrences</hi> of the Week, calld the two and twentieth Week, ending the 29. of <hi>May,</hi> 1646. the Pamphleter tells us 'tis very obſervable to conſider the love and unity which is among the ſouldiers; Now I asked about that time a Chaplaine of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, a moderate Presbyterian, whether it was ſo, and how it came a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, he gave me this anſwer, through the great forbearance of the Presbyterians, who ſuffered them to have their wills, and croſſed them not, took all patiently, and (ſaid he) if the Presbyterians ſhould not have done ſo, but ſtood upon things as the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, it had been impoſſible but the Army had been broken in <note place="margin">☜</note> twenty peeces many a time before this, for the Sectaries are of ſuch a proud high ſpirit, that if they had not had their wills, there would have been no peace; and indeed both in Armies, Aſſembly, City, there hath been that forbearing, yeelding on the Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an party, in reference to the publike, that the Independents and Sectaries, if they had been in their place would never have done, though it had coſt the totall loſſe of three Kingdomes. I beleeve no age nor ſtory can parallell, all things conſidered, the Love,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:113943:117"/>
Patience, long-ſuffering of the Presbyterians, yea the paſſing by and putting up ſo many provocations, and unſufferable abuſes as they have done, and that from a contemptible handfull of men in compariſon; but thats our comfort, <hi>That the patient expectation of the poore ſhall not be forgotten for ever, and that God will ſave the afflicted people, but will bring downe high looks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have been aſſured from divers good hands, as Citizens and others, that the greateſt thing in the City Remonſtrance that the Sectaries are offended at, is that about places of publike truſt, they take that moſt hainouſly, that Sectaries ſhould not have places of honour, profit, and power; which clearly ſhewes to all the world, 'tis not a bare Toleration of their conſciences, &amp; of enjoying their own perſonall Eſtates in the Land that they ſeek, or which would content them; but they look for Preferment, Rewards, power to have others under them; ſo that 'tis a Domination, and to be in ſuch a condition that others may ſeek to them to be Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, that they aime at; a Toleration and liberty of conſcience contents them not, but a Liberty of Offices, and a power of great places, both in Military and civill affaires they ſtand for. Maſter <hi>Burroughs</hi> in the yeare 1645. both preached and printed, even in that Tractate where he pleades for a Toleration, <q>That the Magiſtrate may, to men who differ from the State, in greater Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, (at leaſt) deprive them of <note n="*" place="margin">Mr <hi>Rurr.</hi>

Now certainly if this doctrine were good and true in the yeare, 1645. before the ſucceſſe of the new Modell, and the recruit of the Houſe of Commons, the doctrine in the City Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, 1646. cannot be bad nor falſe, that would have Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts,
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:113943:117"/>
Heriticks, and Schiſmaticks kept, and removed from places of Publike truſt; If they may be denyed priviledges and benefits that are granted to others, and ſome trouble laid in their way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for their opinions, then certainly they ſhould not be preferred above others to all places of publike truſt, whilſt men who conforme to the true Religion eſtabliſhed by the State, be kept out, yea turned out of places; And as Maſter <hi>Burroughs</hi> was of this mind, ſo I and divers others have heard Mr <hi>Tho. Goodwin</hi> ingenuouſly profeſſe ſince this Parliament, though the Magiſtrate ſhould forbeare tender conſciences that could not come up to the Rule, yet it was moſt equall that the countenance and prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments <note place="margin">☜</note> in the Magiſtrates hands, ſhould be beſtowed only on thoſe who conformed to what was eſtabliſhed; and therefore ſaid hee, we deſire only to be ſuffered to live, and enjoy the Ordinances, but expect no places nor any of that maintenance which is in the States diſpoſing; and therefore the Remonſtrants in that branch of their Petition were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>'s no more graines of trouble then might help aginſt this wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the truth of it is theſe preferments, places of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like truſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have made more Sectaries and Anti-Presbyterians, then all the Sermons and Books ever preached and printed by the Sectaries and 'tis one of the great ſprings of all our evills, the prime cauſe of all Injuſtice, Oppreſſion, Error, Faction; and things will never go well with the publike, nor the union of both Kingdomes be ſoundly ſetled, till Hereticks, Blaſphemers, Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks, <note place="margin">☜</note> Seekers, Anabaptiſts, Antinomians, Libertines, Brow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, and Independents, be removed from all places of publike truſt, both Martiall and Civill; and 'tis a moſt righteous thing to Petition for it. As the zealous Proteſtants of this Kingdome could not expect Juſtice, protection from Popiſh Counſellours, Judges, Juſtices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then in place, and we cryed out of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Parliament, as an intolerable griveance and miſcheif to the good ſubjects of this Kingdome, becauſe men but ſuſpected of Popery, or whoſe Wives were Papiſts, were in places of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like truſt (for by that meanes Papiſts were brought off, and ſuch

               <p>There were ſome Independents, that dining in <hi>June</hi> laſt at the houſe of a Presbyterian who married an Independent, were ſpeaking of the Presbyterians, that generally all of them deſired that help might goe for <hi>Ireland,</hi> and that on the Faſt day in <hi>June</hi> they preached and prayed much for help to relieve <hi>Ireland,</hi> and among other Miniſters they named one that ſhould pray thus, or to this effect, That now <hi>Oxford</hi> was taken, all might goe, Lord let them all goe: Theſe Independents ſaid the Presbyterians had ſome deſign ſure, they were ſo earneſt for the Army to goe to <hi>Ireland;</hi> but ſome of the Independents ſaid, they had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, or other uſe for the Army then to goe to <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

               <p>The Sectaries in the Moneth of <hi>May</hi> laſt raged extremely, and ſpake deſperately, ſo that a Common-Councell man who had heard many of them ſpeak, told me he had ſaid to ſome of them, that they muſt provide <hi>Bedlam</hi> for them: The newes of the Kings going to the <hi>Scots,</hi> the Remonſtrance of the City of <hi>London,</hi> with ſome other things that fell out that Moneth, vexed them terribly; one Sectary a kind of Gentleman belonging to a Parliament man ſaid in the hearing of ſome, that the King, the Houſe of Lords, the City, the <hi>Scots,</hi> and the Aſſembly were joyned together, but they had the Houſe of Commons and the Army; and gave out ſome ſuch words as if ſome three or foure thouſand horſe ſhould billet in the City: This man was had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Lord Major for theſe words, and I being told of it by one who went to my Lord Majors with him, I alſo having an opportunity asked my Lord Major of the truth of it, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred there was ſuch a thing.</p>

               <p n="4">4. Many Sectaries and Independents are very looſe in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall courſe of their lives, and take a great deale of liberty, which the Presbyterians dare not take, neither did they before they turned Independents: many of them make little of the Lords day, nothing at all of Faſt dayes, nor of Thankſgiving dayes, not of the fifth of <hi>November;</hi> many of them will play at Cards and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, and uſe liberally other kind of ſports and recreations; they will plead for going to Playes, and thouſands of them are careleſſe in all holy duties, caſting of Prayer, ſinging of Pſalmes, reading the Scriptures, repeating of Sermons, inſtructing their families; yea, many are not aſhamed to ſpeak againſt them: I have beene told for certaine there are Sectaries will ſweare by their tender <note place="margin">☜</note> conſciences, and all the Sectaries generally take more liberty in brave and faſhionable apparell, in long haire, in jeſting and laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in looſe and idle diſcourſes, then godly ſtrict Chriſtians uſe to take, many of them preach ſeldomer then before turned Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents, and will have a care they take not too much paines.</p>

That they make it their work and buſineſſe to corrupt, deſtroy, and overthrow all Religion and godlineſſe, to lay all waſt, and to ſet open a wide gate to all error and licentiouſneſſe of living, for the effecting of which they doe not only uſe all means and wayes for a Univerſall Toleration of all Hereſies, Blaſphemies, Atheiſme, which may happen to ariſe; that there being ſuch, they may be tolerated, go unpuniſhed (which Toleration alone would cauſe growth of Hereſies faſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and the ruine of Religion and godlineſſe) but they plot all wayes, and take all courſes under heaven that all Hereſies and Errors may grow and increaſe, that there may be both abundance of Errors and perſons holding them; and therefore they uſe all their power and intereſt to hinder all things which might prevent the growth of Hereſies a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And on the contrary doe any thing, though never ſo unreaſonable, though never ſo much againſt their owne principles, though never ſo wicked and abominable, ſo it will but advance Errors; hence they ſuffer many Emiſſaries to go from Country to Country, from place to place to broach and vent among people all kinds of Errors, and that by force of Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the will of the Miniſters and people, to invade Churches, Pulpits, to commit tumults, r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

a Toleration and a liberty for all their party to beleeve and live as they luſt; they have talked of purity of Ordinances, and ſpoke againſt mixed Communion as one of their grand grounds of ſeparating from us, and yet they have ſpoken and done all they could to keep mixt Communion among us, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a more exact and full purity; they talke of tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences <note place="margin">☜</note> and Conſcience, when as they have Conſciences can ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low and digeſt any thing, Oſtrich ſtomacks, can lie groſſely, deceive and cozen, prophane the Lords day, make nothing of holy duties, lay traps and ſnares to catch men, &amp;c. they ſpeak of new truths and new light, but under thoſe notions bring in all abominable Errors and Hereſies into the Church of God, pretend the ſpreading of the Goſpel, and preaching, but in truth the ſpreading and increaſing of all Hereſies and Schiſme.

There is hardly a noted Sectary in the Kingdome, or lately come out of <hi>New-England, Holland, &amp;c.</hi> who is in any kind capable of an office, place, gift, or reſpect, but he is in ſome one or other, and hath beene the better for theſe times. 3. The Sectaries have pretended the liberty of the Subject, the publick liberties of the Kingdome; this they have much held out, and this they have fought for, they ſay, and not Religon; and this is much ſpoken of in all their Pamphlets and Speeches, whereas Sectaries have for the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of their owne way and opinions, done the higheſt acts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the liberties of the people that ever were, and indeed make nothing of trampling upon the ſubjects liberties and making them ſlaves, being men that where they are in place,

There are many ſad ſtories in this kind too large to be now related. What enemies many of the Sectaries have beene to the peoples petitioning the Parliament to make knowne their greivances, what obſtructions and blocks they have laid in their way in that kind by printing of, and wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt their Petitions before delivered, by branding the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners for then ill-affected, refined Malignants, driving on the Kings deſigne and I know not what, by preaching againſt their Petitions, by endeavouring to get Votes and Orders againſt Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, by labouring to moleſt the Petitioners to have them ſent for to attend Committees, to be put to charges, &amp; kept in ſafe cuſtody, &amp;c. is wel known to the Kingdom, and ſure that's a great part of the liberty and priviledge of the ſubject, and if they may not be free to Petition, what's become of the liberty of the ſubject? Such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in all ages as have been looked upon moſt for advancing their Prerogative, &amp; oppreſſing the people, and been a gainſt al defenſive Arms and other wayes of the peoples ſeeking their right, yet ſtill granted them the liberty of petitioning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judge <note place="margin">☞</note> that; they have allowed <hi>preces &amp; lachrymae</hi> to be the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons of Chriſtian ſubjects, though not Swords and Guns.

               <p>5. The Sectaries abominable hypocriſie ſhowes it ſelfe in yeelding to things againſt their mind and conſcience, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may be in a capacity and inabled to deſtroy and overthrow what they ſeeme to be for, working and uſing all their power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; as for example many of the Sectaries took the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and do take it (which they hate with al their ſouls) that ſo they might come into ſuch places, &amp; keep ſuch places, where being they improve thoſe places all they can to deſtroy the Covenant, and the contents of it, hindring a Uniformity and the neereſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juction

The Sectaries great hypocriſie is ſeene, in that in their ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches oft-times, many of their Pamphlets, and for divers of their actions why they do ſuch things, and why they refuſe this and that, as not hearing our Miniſters preach, not joyning to our Aſſemblies, not paying their Tyths, with many ſuch, they alledge the Covenant and bring that for their ground, tis againſt ſuch an Article of the Covenant, or ſuch a clauſe of an Article, when as tis knowne to God, and hotoriouſly manifeſt to all the world they care not at all for the Covenant, make nothing of it, but daily with a high hand breake every-Article, and every clauſe of each Article; but their doing and refuſing of ſuch and ſuch things, are upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grounds and ends, as the ſaving their purſes, their deſtroying of a ſettled Miniſtry, the increaſing and ſpreading of all Errors and Hereſies, and bringing in of confuſion into Church and State: I could write a large book upon this ſubject how the Sectaries daily break the Covenant, and are indeed like to thoſe ſpoken of in <hi>Daniel 11. 32.

The Atturny wiſhed him to try a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain if he would not pay it by faire meanes, and to tell him he would put his band in ſuit; whereupon this Sectary promiſed to pay him twenty five pound ſuddenly on ſuch a day, and when he came it ſhould be ready, and the other twenty five at ſuch a time, with which anſwer this Creditor was content, and came one the day ſet for the firſt 25. li. which this Sectary told him was ready, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired him to go up into his houſe with him, and he ſhould receive it; now when he came up into the roome there the 25 pound was ready on a table, but before he had received it, putting his hand into his pocket to pull out his handkercher, the Bond for his 50 pound accidentally came forth with it, which as he was looking upon it, this Sectary came of a ſuddain and ſnached it out of the mans hand <note place="margin">☞</note> and tore it all in peeces before his face, ſaying he owed him nothing, whereupon this Citizen being amazed, asked him what he meant; he ſaid he owed him nothing, come by it as he could; to which the Citizen replied, I will have this 25 pound howſoever, and laid hands on it, but he threatned him to meddle with it if he durſt, and knocked with his foot to call up ſome body out of his ſhop, ſaying to them this man will take my money from me by force, ſo that this honeſt man was glad to go away without his Bond or any of the money. Upon this he went to a Counſellor at Law, one Mr. <hi>W.</hi> related his caſe, deſiring his councell in it. He adviſed him to make no words of it, ſay nothing, but at the Seſſions endite him, and get a Warrant of a Suddain before he could take councell to fetch him away, and it may be being ſo ſurpriſed he would pay him the money rather then ſtand it out to anſwer it at the Seſſions: The Citizen followed his adviſe; when the Seſſions came, had a bill drawn againſt him; the Atturney who had ſeen the Bond witneſſed there was ſuch a ſpeciall tye, the Bill was found, and a Warrant ſent out for to attach him; the Officer ſerving it and threatning preſently to carry him away; thereupon this Sectary confeſſed his evill, he entreated his mercy that he would not ſhame him pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, it ſhould be a warning to him for ever after, and ſo he paying the money, the man proſecuted him no further.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>Burton</hi> whether is this a good Argument, becauſe <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi>

               <hi>Danaeus</hi> in his Commentaries upon <hi>Auguſtine de Haereſibus</hi> ſhowes what ſinnes accompany hereſies, and how a looſe life followes alwaies upon errours, <hi>The diſorder of manners and contempt of all Diſcipline being the perpetuall companion of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies.

And as Scripture and Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhowes us this, ſo our own expetience plentifully proves it, many men who before they were Sectaries, or upon their firſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance that were famous for the power of godlineſſe, being now Libertines and licentious, making no conſcience of the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both, Family duties, &amp;c.

There's no queſtion, but many of thoſe Sectaries who heretofore were outwardly holy and ſtrict, having ſome ſecret luſts and ſinnes which they were no longer willing to forbeare, (however new light, free grace Chriſtian-liberty, Spirituality were pretended) fell to thoſe opinions and entertained thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of Antinomianiſme, Anabaptiſme, Independency, as a way wherein they might freelier enjoy thoſe luſts, and caſt off <note place="margin">☞</note>

It were eaſie to demonſtrate how the love of ſome luſt or other in mens hearts (though at firſt not percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved) hath been a great cauſe of ſo many in our times falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the errours of Antinomianiſme, Anabaptiſme, Libertiniſme, Independency, and ſo indeed in all times ſome wickedneſſe or other hath been the ſpring and mother of Errour and hereſie, as pride and vain glory, covetuouſneſſe and filthy lucre, a deſire of contention, an evill conſcience, and when ſome luſt (though ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret) hath brought forth an errour, this and that falſe doctrine, then thoſe Doctrines fully received daily ſtrengthen and nouriſh thoſe luſts, yea daily increaſe unto more ungodlineſſe, as the not being liable to be queſtioned by ſuperiour Aſſemblies as Claſſes Synods, emboldens men to broach and ſpred ſuch errors, as holding that God ſees no ſinne in his Children, that all our ſinnes cannot hurt us, nor all our good workes further our ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, encourages men to ſinne more freely, as believing that the ſoules dye with the bodies, or elſe ſleep till the reſurrection, yea that there is no reſurrection, makes men ſay let us eate and drinke for to morrow we ſhall dye, that is ſince the ſoule dyes with the body, and the body ſhall riſe no more, therefore let us take what we find here, enjoy our pleaſures and ſatisfie our luſts whileſt we may.</p>

In the Biſhops times before this Parliament there was great favour ſhewed towards Papiſts and perſons Popiſhly affected, but did they come into our Churches eſtabliſhed by Law and bringing their Prieſts put by our Miniſters from preaching and celebrating the Lords Supper, and ſet up againſt the will of the Miniſters and Pariſhioners their owne Prieſts to preach points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and to ſay Maſſe; or did the Biſhops when Popery was

I had thought upon and drawn up twelve pregnant particulars with the proofes wherein the Toleration

differences have beene betweene <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents taken at <hi>London,</hi> why the Aſſembly and godly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Kingdome ſlighted, many well-affected Counties offended, Petitions not regarded, the well-affected diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, many great greivances not remedied, many Delinquents protected and not call'd to an account, ſtrange Articles given to ſome in Armes at ſome places contrary to Ordinances of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, illegall elections of Members of the Houſe of Commons taking place, ſo many ſcandalous pamphlets againſt Monarchie, the Houſe of Peers and Houſe of Commons ſold openly, ſuch high inſolencies committed againſt the Houſe of Peers as never were in any age, with many more, namely that great love and favour of Sectariſme and Errors in too many perſons of our times: This is the ſpring that feeds all our evils, the <hi>primum mobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> or great wheele that turns all the reſt about: Hence tis no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter though <hi>Ireland</hi> be loſt, <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> embroyled, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament and <hi>London</hi> at a diſtance, the godly Miniſters hearts loſt, the Kingdome offended, Armies and great Taxes continued, &amp;c. rather then any thing be done againſt Sectaries: Sectaries muſt not be diſ-eaſed or diſpleaſed what ever come of it, they muſt be nouriſhed and increaſe, <hi>Eraſtian</hi> principles muſt be maintained and cried up, prophaneſſe let alone, open wicked men joyned with, and all to further Sectariſme and Liberty of Conſcience ſo called. Whoſoever knowes and hath obſerved the preſent af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs and ſtate of things cannot but ſee the truth of what I now ſay; and I challenge any man to inſtance in any one thing at leaſt for theſe laſt twelve months, wherein ſo many evils have been and are upon us, but I will rationally reſolve into that, and though other pretences have been held out, as ſometimes priviledges, ſometimes the liberty and ſafety of the ſubject, ſometimes godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſometimes unſeaſonableſſe an unfit time, &amp;c. many things folded together, and indeed the love of Sectariſme ſometimes ſo wrapt up in them that not diſcerned by all, as in all ages men have not wanted pretences, yet <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

care of Sectaries whom we know the <hi>Scots</hi> ſo hate, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have done it out of revenge? Is it not evident the true and only reaſon of the Cities being ſo ſlighted, reviled, ſuch a change of carriage towards them to ariſe from their appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring againſt the Sects and Errors of the times, and ſtriking in with the Miniſters to joyne for a thorough Presbyteriall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? have not all the alterations towards the City beene ſince that time, and began at that time? Is it not evident what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is pretended, as want of time, the feare of the Tyranny of Miniſters, &amp;c. the cauſe why Religion and the Church Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is no better ſettled to be the love of Error and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie which they know the Government would deſtroy? And ſo I might go thorough the reſt, and therefore we may ſee to whom, and to what to attribute all the miſcheifs and evils that are upon us, and further hang over us. <hi>Canterbury, Strafford,</hi> or whom elſe you will name, out of deſignes of Popery or ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute greatneſſe, or what elſe you will imagine, were never greater cauſes of all the evills and miſcheifs in their times, of differences with the <hi>Scots,</hi> of invading the liberties of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, &amp;c. then ſome men among us are of our preſent evils, and all to uphold the faction of Sectaries and Opinioniſts and to make way for a Toleration, which to advance and bring about and themſelves by that to greatneſſe of place and eſtate, and to <note place="margin">☜</note> licentiouſneſſe of living, they are ſo madly ſet upon it, that they care not to run the hazard of ruining three Kingdomes, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing all into a Chaos of confuſion in Church and State, that ſo they man have the creating of all new, and erect their Babell. But it may be ſome will ſay, tis wonder there ſhould be ſo great a party loving and favouring Sectariſme and Error, as to be able to hinder things thus, and to diſturbe the Kingdomes, and if there ſhould be ſo, what may be the true reaſon of the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great favouring of all kind of Sectaries and Libertines. 1. I anſwer, there are ſome men who have beene and are but meane in outward eſtate, birth, and place, and others though richer in the world, yet below in the vallies in compariſon, and being exceeding ambitious, proud, covetous, and withall ſubtile, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending alſo by reaſon of theſe deep diſtractions and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles

in the State, an opportunity of becoming great and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing themſelves by being the heads of a great party, and get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an intereſt and great power in many people, and knowing <note place="margin">☞</note> the corruption of mens hearts, how pleaſing liberty and to have a mans ſwinge is, and obſerving which way the pulſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent times beat, thereupon have ſet themſelves to ſtand for, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance all kind of Errors and all kind of men whatever they be that doe walke in irregular wayes: Theſe men being Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians know that the appearing for any one Sect two or three, and reſtraining the reſt will not doe their work, make them the heads of ſuch a conſiderable party as be able to deale with the <note place="margin">☞</note> oppoſition they may likely meet with in their ambitious deſignes, but if they would doe good upon it, they muſt let looſe the rains to all Errors whatſoever, Errors againſt the Scriptures, againſt denying a God, the Trinity, &amp;c. they muſt preferre all ſorts of men of thoſe principles one as well as another, conſtantly ſtand by, and appeare for all that are queſtioned in that way let their opinions be what they will, their carriages never ſo inſolent in the ſpreading of them, and their perſons never ſo unworthy and contemptible, on the contrary oppoſing, undermining and breaking all thoſe who are active againſt their party, and by thus doing, proclaiming as it were open liberty to all men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ſeverall wayes and luſts, Papiſts, Atheiſts, Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines, &amp;c. they are in a faire way in ſome convenient time (keeping off any thing too from being ſettled) to have ſo many freinds as to be able to help them into the ſaddle, eſpecially at a time when others are juſtled out. <hi>Jeroboam</hi> to keep the people to him, and to ſtrengthen the Kingdome, fearing leaſt they ſhould returne from him to <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> took counſell and made two golden Calves, and ſaid to the people <hi>tis too much for you to</hi> go up to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and inſtead of the ſonnes of <hi>Levi</hi> made Preiſts of the people, for the Calves which he had made, and whoſoever would might become one of the Preiſts: So there are too many in our dayes that they may get the people to them, and ſtrengthen their power have made golden Calves, ſet up the Doctrine of Toleration of all Religions, a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping of Calves, and give liberty to whoſoever will the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt

To the firſt ſort, conſider, have you not beene too long cheated and carried along with faire pretences almoſt to the utter ruine of Religion and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? have you not, and doe you not ſee in many af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires one thing pretended and another intended? doe you not ſee evidently that their godlineſſe is <hi>gaine and great places,</hi> that their zeale for preaching and ſpreading the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell, <note place="margin">☞</note> is to have all Errors and Hereſies of a ſuddaine ſpread over the Kingdome, and ſo in other things, and will you ſtill ſuffer your ſelves to be deceived by them? there are ſome who were courted and complemented with, and doe confeſſe they were deceived by them, and have left them, doe you ſo like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and deliver your ſelves and the Kingdome thereby out of this Babell. Secondly, conſider you had as good leave them at firſt as at laſt, for either you muſt reſolve to go thorough with them in all their deſignes, and to the higheſt, which I ſuppoſe midling well meaning men intend not, but abhor to think of, or elſe if not, then when they have by your help effected and brought about their ends, they will caſt you off, and you ſhall be ſerved with the ſame ſauce as the zealous Presbyterians, thus the Prelats ſerved divers whom they made uſe of, and would not go on with them in every thing, and ſo will the Sectaries
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:113943:173"/>
ſerve many well-meaning men who know not the depths of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, therefore 'tis better for you to leave them, then that they being made ſtrong by your meanes ſhould in the end ruine and deſtroy you; and let ſuch moderate well-meaning men know, that if they will ſtill adhere to that party after all theſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of them, God will look upon them as partakers of all their ſinnes, will deſtroy them with the Sectaries, and they are like to periſh in the gain-ſaying of <hi>Core;</hi> and therefore I beſpeak<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> them in the words of <hi>Moſes, Numb. 16. 26. Depart I pray you from the Tents of theſe wicked men, touch nothing of theirs, leaſt yee be conſumed in all their ſinnes;</hi> feare, ſuſpect every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that comes from that party, though it ſeeme never ſo good, though propounded by others not of their way, and if it be not a thing exceeding cleare and certaine to thee, take heed of cloſing in with it, rather ſuſpend and adviſe upon it: for theſe Sectaries often act by other men, get good men who ſee not their depths to promote their cauſe, hiding alwayes the hook of their deſignes under the bait of priviledge, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, ſafety, godlineſſe, all which are not regarded by them, but the doing of their work, the increaſe of Sectariſme and Error. For the other ſort the Presbyterians, conſider, what a ſhame 'tis that a handfull of men in compariſon ſhould by their activity, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, minding their work, bring things to that paſſe they are, in our Armies, Councels, City, Country, and the Presbyterians of both Kingdomes ten times as many <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

If Mr <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs</hi> had done thus, he had dealt fairly, but this would not have made good Mr <hi>Burroughs</hi> his end to breed a beleif in the Reader of the falſeneſſe of matters related in my book, I had then bin ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred to the Reader only miſtaken in a circumſtance of a ſtory which would have been accounted no great matter, and the truth of the ſtory for the ſubſtance and the ſeverall particulars in it would have weighed down all miſpriſion in the minds of men

For that Maſter <hi>Burroughs</hi> charges me with page 2, and 3. that when I have heard <hi>vild reproachfull things againſt ſuch as I owned to be godly, and they living neer me in the City have ſent to me to offer to ſatisfie me if I would confer with them, and cleerly convince me of the falſeneſſe of ſuch reports, how the men were traduced and I abuſed in ſuch reports, yet that I ſhould refuſe to conferre with them and fall a laying on, &amp;c.</hi> I do utterly deny that ever there was any ſuch thing, or any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſent to me, and cannot imagine any reaſon in the world Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Burroughs</hi> ſhould writ ſo, and whoever told him any ſuch thing, abuſed him, and I could by many reaſons prove the contrary, if I were giving a formall Anſwer to Maſter <hi>Burroughs</hi> Book. Is it likely that I who have gone on purpoſe to ſo many, and do day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly upon all occaſions, that have write ſo many Letters even to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote places to know the certainty of things reported, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy others to inquire out the truth where I cannot ſo well do it my ſelf, that intreat perſons who relate things to me, to ſend the eare witneſſes and proofs to me, that reject many reports of things which may be true, and are reported with much confidence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſee a full proof of them, that I ſhould decline to ſpeak with thoſe who ſend to me to ſatisfie me in the truth of things, and whom I own to be godly? No, this is utterly falſe, a very legend, againſt my genius and conſtant courſe of proceeding in this work, I taking much content, in ſearching all wayes to be ſatisfied in the truth of things related me, or in their falſeneſſe, that ſo I may not by printing any thing miſtaken, give an occaſion to the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioning of the truth of thoſe things that are undoubtedly true; and for further ſatisfacttou to the Reader there was no ſuch thing, why could not the parties themſelves come to ſpeak with me, but muſt ſend others, I am eaſily enough to be ſpoken with, refuſing none (as all know who come to me) beſides, how did Maſter <hi>Burroughs</hi> know any ſuch had been with me to make me ſuch offers, and that I refuſed; and what if ſome reported to him that which was falſe, might not he be eaſier abuſed by a report (for he ſpeaks not this of his own knowledge, he never came to me, nor was the man ever deſired to confer with me about any of theſe particulars) then I can be miſtaken in this buſineſſe, to whom theſe offers of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences

For that Maſter <hi>Burroughs</hi> page 18. taxes me with concerning what I relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about his going out of the Kingdom in my <hi>Antapologie, that had I been willing to have conferred with him about it as he deſired be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I printed he ſhould have ſo fully ſatisfied me, that I could never have ſtumbled at this;</hi> I Anſwer, I never was unwilling to confer with Maſtet <hi>Burroughs</hi> about this or any other thing that he ſhould have deſired, and I can ſay it truely, if he had ſent the leaſt boy at any time to me to have deſired a conference with me, and appointed me where to meet him I ſhould have waited on him: but for what is here written, I neither know nor remember any ſuch thing that Maſter <hi>Burroughs</hi> either by writing, or word of mouth ever deſired to have ſpoken with me about his going out of the Kingdom; and certainly at that time when I was writing my <hi>Antapologie</hi> there was no ſuch great diſtance between Maſter <hi>Burroughs</hi> and me, but that he might either have come to me, or ſpoke to me of it when he met me occaſionally, or I ſhould have come to him: none of which ever were moved to me, and I cannot but wonder at Maſter <hi>Burroughs</hi> writing of this and divers other paſſages. 2 As for that hee ſaid hee ſhould have ſatisfied me upon conference, that he went out of the Kingdom not upon the ground I alledge, but upon another, a call from the Church of <hi>Roterdam,</hi> which he relates page 19, 20, 21, 22. I muſt confeſſe I am unſatisfied in it now, and ſo I beleive are all rationall men, and let the Reader but aske Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Marſhall</hi> and Maſter <hi>Calamie</hi> who knew the buſineſſe well and Maſter <hi>Burroughs</hi> at that time, whether they do not beleive he went over to <hi>Roterdam</hi> upon a complaint made of ſome words ſpoken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Scottiſh Warre: and if I ſhould have given the Reader all that I have drawn up by way of Anſwer to this, it would abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly clear me, and lay open Maſter <hi>Burroughs</hi> weakneſſe very much, but I ſhall only hint this, Suppoſe the King had in this War prevailed over the Parliament, and taken the City; and juſt upon that time Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> and Maſter <hi>Wels</hi> had gotten away in all haſte to <hi>New England;</hi> and ſuppoſe after this, ſome man writing of Maſter <hi>Wels</hi> and Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> departure from <hi>England</hi> ſhould have expreſſed this as the ground, the danger they were in upon the Kings taking <hi>London;</hi> now if Maſter <hi>Peters</hi> and Maſter <hi>Wels</hi> ſhould
