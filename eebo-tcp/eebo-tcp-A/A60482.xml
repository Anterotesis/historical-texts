         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And is himſelf as willing, as any

ſuch is his Allegiance to his King,
that if he can but keep off their
foul fingers from Him, to which
they are apt enough, he cares not
how heavy they fall upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:
And on the other hand, if
there be any thing herein contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
of true value, it will but
ſhine the brighter for the rubs and
petulant endeavours of all Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductitious
detractors; who being
thruſt out of ſome mercenary Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
in a few months time
by their mother wit (which for
want of good neighbours they
greatly cry up themſelves, and
<pb facs="tcp:64566:3"/>
inſtead of bad neighbours do
cloſely inſinuate as if all others
wanted it) can get knowledge
enough in Phyſick to contemn
and vilifie, and in two words
(<hi>viz. Galeniſts</hi> and fools,) abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
confute all thoſe worthy
Perſons, who from Childhood to
Gray-hairs, have been ſtudying,
endeavouring, and praying; have
been exerciſing both their minds
and their bodies; their heads, their
hearts, and their hands; that they
may become expert Seconds unto
Nature, and meet Combatants for
all thoſe dreadful Enemies that
the Sins of man have ſtirred up
againſt the peace of his own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.
But beſide this ſcum of ill
conditioned <hi>Zoili,</hi> there are others
alſo nipling at the heel of learned
Phyſicians: Whoſe wounds though
ſeemingly ſlightly inflicted, yet are
<pb facs="tcp:64566:4"/>
far worſe than the former, and
that not only becauſe they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
of credit and knowledge, but
becauſe they pretend Friendſhip,
and kiſs while they do the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.
Theſe are thoſe, whom
Birth, Education, and Induſtry,
have ſo ſecurely ſeated in honour,
that nothing can poſſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throne
them, but that which caſt
the Angels from heaven, and man

<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which for ever did, and
for ever will, ſet God in a reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
and the beſt of their
Friends cannot but in time mind
them, that thoſe ſmart reflexions
without cauſe, both in private and
publick, not only upon particular
perſons, but upon whole Societies
of men, (half of whom they know
not ſo much as by hear-ſay,) ſeem
to have a tincture of that virulent
<pb facs="tcp:64566:4"/>
poyſon, which as eaſily and as
quickly proceeds out of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
as the Worm did out of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi>
Gourd; and will (if not ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
prevented) ſoon wither into
nothing all that content under
which they have for a ſeaſon glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſhadowed themſelves. And
here I am afreſh put in mind of
the Story of <hi>Herod,</hi> who perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the Worlds Worthies, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſaw it pleaſed the People,
he proceeded farther alſo: And
thus proſecuting his rage and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition,
in royal Apparel, and with
Popular Oratory, the Angel of the
Lord ſmote him, becauſe he gave
not God the glory, and he was
eaten of Worms. That main and
beſt end, which ſecureth all men
in their undertakings, was it
which firſt moved the Author
hereof to ſtudy ſacred Philoſophy,
<pb facs="tcp:64566:5"/>
and to apply himſelf to the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation
of ſuch Scriptures, as
border upon that Faculty unto
which he hath betook himſelf,
ever ſince he hath had the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Election wherein he
might be moſt ſerviceable in his
Generation. This was the good
Seed: but falling into a barren
and ill manured ſoil, hath for the
preſent, produced no better a
blade, than what you here ſee;
which however, if it pleaſe the
Lord to proſper, may bring forth
as uſeful fruit as thoſe that ſeem
more fair and flouriſhing. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
old men may ſee their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
faces, as in a Glaſs; and
young men may foreſee, what (if
they live) will certainly betide
them in their latter end. Syſtemes
and compleat Treatiſes (though
out of faſhion, and conſequently
<pb facs="tcp:64566:5"/>
neglected in this Mimical Age)
are of better uſe, than fragments
of Mechaniſm, and Independent
Pieces of Experimental Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which by moſt men at
preſent are had in greateſt honour
and reputation; But in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of honour, the ground-work
of what is here diſcourſed

the Author thereof being the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt,
and the greateſt Earthly Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate
throughout all Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
The Portraiture that is here
drawn, is done by the hands of
no meaner a perſon than King
<hi>Solomon,</hi> and may juſtly be called,
<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; that ſuperabundant wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
in natural things, which it
pleaſed God miraculouſly to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich
him withall, beyond all that
were before him, or ſince to this
very day; being no where more
<pb facs="tcp:64566:6"/>
Graphically delineated, than in
this deſcription of Age; whereby
it plainly appears, that <hi>Solomon</hi>
was not like that forward Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
who was well skilled in For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Countries, and in the mean
time knew little or nothing of his
own native Land. For as he very
well knew all Vegetables, from
the Cedar in <hi>Lebanon,</hi> to the Hyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſop
that ſpringeth out of the wall,
and thoſe Creatures alſo of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
higher rank, namely, all Beaſts,
Fowls, Creeping things, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes:
So neither was he ignorant
at home; but that wherein his
greateſt wiſdom conſiſted, was,
that he perfectly knew himſelf;
And that <hi>Intus &amp; in Cute;</hi> both
in reſpect of the inward and the
outward man: All the ſecret and
myſterious powers of the mind
were as naked and open before
<pb facs="tcp:64566:6"/>
him, as the viſible parts of the
Body are before a Vulgar Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt,
and his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in this Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory
contained, doth more fully
and ſatisfactorily declare and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
them, than whatſoever
hitherto hath been endeavoured
to that purpoſe, by the beſt of
Moraliſts; and as for the parts of
the body, thoſe appoſite Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boles
which are here all along the
Deſcription brought to expreſs
them, do abundantly declare his
moſt exquiſite and exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in them all. Not only ſuch
a knowledge, as was then attai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in the World, or as ſhould in
after Ages be attained by any;
but ſuch an one, as was attaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
or as the Humane Nature
was able to Comprehend; and
whatſoever certain Inventions in
<pb facs="tcp:64566:7"/>
Anatomy have crowned the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
Inquirers of ſucceeding
time, lie couched in ſome one or
other Expreſſion of this Allegory.
Among many other things, it is
here clearly demonſtrated, that
<hi>Solomon</hi> perfectly knew, and as
plainly as his Figurative Method
would give leave, deſcribed the
Circular Motion of the Bloud;
the beſt and moſt uſeful Invention
of this Latter Age. And as for the
Subject which is directly here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
<hi>viz.</hi> the Deſcription of
the Infirmities of Age, though it
be Compendiouſly handled by
him, yet it is Compleatly done in
all things appertaining thereunto,
both Moral, Natural, and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine.
And indeed, what can the
man ſay that comes after the
King? The moſt knowing and
<pb facs="tcp:64566:7"/>
ingenious Perſons in the beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned
Generations, can add no
more hereunto, than they can un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
their own ſtature: It only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains,
that ſome ſuch, give us the
full Interpretation of what is here
delivered, ſince it pleaſed the
King to leave it to after Ages, inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped
with a Canopy of the ſame
wiſdom that indited it. And if
this weak Eſſay may excite any
ſuch, for the future lovingly to
Correct what is here amiſs, and
to ſupply what is here deficient;
it will be a moſt acceptable work;
but if for the preſent, Courteous
Reader, it may be of any uſe to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

is not the only, that may be acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
by ſearching the Scripture; for there
are many natural things, the knowledge
whereof may be better gained in one line
of them, than in whole Volumes of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed

God to deal with thoſe who are ſincere,

of the ſad Symptomes of extream Old
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:64566:9"/>
Age, And ſuch an one as I dare be bold to
ſay, is not elſewhere to be found. When
the wiſdom of the omniſcient God, through

                  </gap>gmatical
I confeſs it, and exceeding difficult; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I have the more diligently applyed my
ſelf to the Interpretation of it. And ſo
much the rather, becauſe I find various
ſenſes put upon the words, and ſcarce any
one hath, without interruption, carried the
Allegory clean through the whole ſix ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
as I judge it ought to be. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
a miſtake in the parts of man, may
cauſe a miſtake in the literal iuterpretation,
I (whoſe ſtudy it hath been to be more
verſed in thoſe than uſual Interpreters) do
take the liberty to endeavour explication,
wherein, if beſide my own ſatisfaction and
content, I ſhall add any thing to others
knowledge, I ſhall therein have a ſecond
reward.</p>
               <p>I am not ignorant of all, nor do I deſpiſe
any, of thoſe ſeveral interpretations both
Literal and Myſtical, that ſeveral learned
and good men have been exerciſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in. There are that expound all this
Allegory, or at leaſt ſome part of it, to a
ſtate of wickedneſs, to a ſtate of poverty,

of bread, or of the Word of God, to the
ſeveral diſperſions and Captivities of the
Jews, to the deſtruction of both the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the obſtinacy of
the Jews, to the unprofitableneſs of the
Gentiles under their Miniſtry, to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy
of the latter times, to the end of the
world, and to the day of Judgment. I know
God doth at ſundry times,<note place="margin">Heb. 1. 1.</note> and in divers
manners ſpeak unto the World by his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.
And knowing this firſt, that no
Propheſie of the Scripture is of any private
interpretation; I know this from thence,
that no private Interpreter whatſoever is
to bind up others to the meaſure of his own
underſtanding. Now as I am againſt no
other, ſo there is no other againſt me in
this that I am about. All that can be ſaid
concerning it, is, that it is low, and mean,
and ordinary, however (confeſt by all) it
is true, genuine, and proper. And this
may be ſaid of it beyond all other whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
that it is the baſis and foundation of
all the reſt. And every one of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
their clarity of truth, from the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
they bear to this primary Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
that is, that theſe ſix verſes, are a true
and proper deſcription, of the natural, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm,
and decrepit Age of mankind. That
which the Latines call <hi>Aetas Capularis;</hi>
                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:64566:10"/>
the age of him who is ſhortly to be taken;
unto Death, or into the Coffin, or upon
the Bier, or into the Grave; plainly the age
of him, who is by Courſe of Nature juſt
at his laſt, and muſt ere long neceſſarily
yield to inevitable diſſolution. There is in
that language alſo another word (which
way ſoever we take its Etymology) that
will excellently ſignifie unto us the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
here delineated. And that is <hi>Sili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernium;</hi>
for whether we take it, <hi>quaſi ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liceâ
herniâ laborans;</hi> he that is troubled
with hard ruptures, as very old men for
the moſt part are, or <hi>Sili herbâ uſurus,</hi> he
that will ſoon call into uſe ſuch an herb as
was then accuſtomed to funeral entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or <hi>Silentibus brevi Cernendus,</hi> he
that will quickly be free among the dead;
or laſtly, <hi>Silices cernens;</hi> he that by his
age and infirmity is continually put in
mind of his Tomb; or rather (that which
ſeems to me moſt proper) he that is bowed
down with age, ſo that he cannot but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
the ground whereon he now ſtands,
and under which he muſt ere long be laid.
And this anſwereth exactly to the Greek
word, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I ſhall not take upon me preciſely to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the bounds of this decrepit ſtate, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as they are various, in reſpect of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64566:11"/>
the diſpoſitions of mens bodies, of their
courſe of lives, and alſo of the places and
ages in which they live. The lives of the
Patriarks before the floud were extended
to almoſt a thouſand years,<note place="margin">Gen. 5. 27.</note> and yet we read
not of thoſe ſad Symptomes attending
them, as attend us now at fourſcore. About
the time of the Floud, God abbreviates the
courſe of mans life, and ſeems preciſely to
ſet it at one hundred and twenty years.<note place="margin">
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

know very well moſt men would have this
Text to be underſtood as a threatning only
to the preſent Inhabitants of the Old
World, that it ſhould be ſo many years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Floud ſwept them all away: But
it ſeems to me (and not to me only) rather
to intend the cutting ſhort of the life of
man for the future.<note place="margin">Joſephus lib. 1. c. 7.</note> For it is clear by the
Context, that the Floud came upon the
World within an hundred years after this
denunciation; which was made when <hi>Noah</hi>
was five hundred years old:<note place="margin">Gen. 5. 32. Cha. 7. 6.</note> And he was
but ſix hundred years old when the Floud
of waters was upon the Earth. Now God
doth ſeldome anticipate the execution of
his Judgements in wrath, but doth often
prorogue it in mercy. It is as clear alſo,
that many there were, even after the
Floud, whoſe lives were prolonged be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
this appointed period, but they
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:64566:11"/>
found it very burthenſome and grievous,
and miſeries with their age dayly came up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them; the firſt-born of death about
that time began to devour their ſtrength,<note place="margin">Job 18. 13.</note>
and to take poſſeſſion of them in the right
of him that was to ſucceed. And they
might then be ſaid to die, in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety
of Language, as <hi>Adam</hi> did in the day
wherein he did eat the forbidden fruit;
but the Pſalmiſt gives a more exact account
of this thing, which may ſtand firm to this
very day:<note place="margin">Pſal 90. 10.</note> 
                  <hi>The daies of our years are three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore
years and ten, and if by reaſon of
ſtrength they be four ſcore years, yet is their
ſtrength labour and ſorrow, for it is ſoon
cut off, and we flee away.</hi> But as the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Fabrick, that God at firſt extracted
out of nothing, draws nearer to its end,
ſo doth every particular ſtructure therein
made, weaken and decay. <hi>As the heaven
and the earth wax old,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iſa. 1. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>ſo they that dwell
therein ſhall dye in like manner.</hi> And
therefore it is not to be thought, that in
theſe daies mans age ſhould be ſo long,
nor ſo many arrive at it, as in the daies
wherein the Bow of Univerſal Nature
abode in its greater ſtrength. Nor can
we exactly put the terms of any mans old
age, ſo as to ſay he is now old at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
moment, but was not ſo before; for
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:64566:12"/>
it is that which creeps on by ſteps and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees,

is my preſent deſign only to meddle with
the Allegory wherein is the deſcription of
Age, I ſhall not detain you in this moſt
important entrance, but immediately fall
upon my work. In this verſe we have
only a general deſcription of that infirm
condition, which is more particularly trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
of in the following verſes.</p>
               <p>Age though it naturally creeps upon all
men, whatſoever their Conſtitutions and
Compoſitions are, yet it is it ſelf a diſeaſe.
<hi>Senectus ipſa morbus.</hi> And it doth certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

follow here in their order.</p>
               <p>Here are two expreſſions that intimate
unto us the unavoydable approach of theſe
decrepit years (<hi>i. e.</hi>) come and draw nigh;
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:64566:15"/>
of which gemination, ſignifying the ſame

coming on. Be we Male or Female, be
we Jew or Gentile, be we bond or free,
be we Princes or Subjects, be we what can
be imagined, they come, they come: While
I write, while thou readeſt, while we wake,
while we ſleep; while we abide at home,
while we go abroad; while we eat, or drink,
or ſport; while we retire our ſelves, we
pray, or faſt; while we neglect our ſelves,
while we defend all we can againſt them,
they draw nigh, they draw nigh. And

                  <hi>de non

his own errour confuted in himſelf.</p>
               <p>Here are two words alſo to expreſs the
continuation of this ſtate ſo long as it ſhall
be, (i. e.) <hi>daies</hi> and <hi>years;</hi> both theſe
words ſignifie alſo the ſame thing in the
general, <hi>viz.</hi> how long this ſtate ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main:
And thus <hi>Jacob</hi> uſeth them both, in
giving an account unto <hi>Pharaoh</hi> how long
his life had continued:<note place="margin">Gen. 47. 9.</note> 
                  <hi>The daies of the

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:64566:15"/>
thirty years, few and evil have the daies of
the years of my life been, and have not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
unto the daies of the years of the life
of my Fathers, in the daies of their pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</hi>
But in particular, they intimate
unto us a diverſity of their continuation to
divers perſons. Some men poſt over this
bad way, and remain but a very little while
in it; others paſs over it more ſlowly, and
continue therein much longer. Some have
but a few daies of labour and ſorrow, others
have them prolonged out to years. As
the Lord only knows what perſon in the
world (for there are but few in theſe laſt
Ages) ſhall be brought to this ſtate; ſo
he only knows how long they ſhall remain
in it. Whether this time ſhall be more or
leſs, whether daies or years ſhall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
it, is to us uncertain, but this is moſt
certain concerning them both, that if they
be at all, ſo long as they are, they ſhall be
evil, they ſhall be unpleaſant.</p>

                  <head>Evil daies.</head>
                  <p>I here take the word evil in a good
ſenſe, that is, not for the evil of ſin, but
the evil of miſery, the fruit of ſin. I know
there be them that would have this word,

ſeems to me to be otherwiſe, and that
chiefly from theſe two reaſons: 1. Becauſe
I find nothing in the Allegory that is not
competible to every particular perſon that
lives to the time of this ſtate, both to the
good and bad, both to the righteous and
the wicked; Weakneſſes, infirmities, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes
both of body and mind attend them
all: <hi>Iſaac, Jacob, Eli, David,</hi> as well as
thoſe who lead never ſo contrary lives, muſt
bear the burden of their age, if they live to
the time. It is moſt certainly true, a

death, are appointed for all living, without
any diſcrimination of him that ſweareth, or

diſtinguiſh of old age; and conſider it in
a threefold ſtate. Firſt, Crude, green,
and while it is yet in the beginning, while
men are able to do buſineſs, and go about
their employments, and this is but one little
remove from manhood, and doth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
border upon it. The ſecond is, full,
mature, or ripe age; when men begin to
leave off their employments, and betake
themſelves to retiredneſs; when God hath
no more work for them, and they have no
more ſtrength for him; or laſtly, extream
ſickly, decrepit, overgrown old age; in which
it may be truly ſaid,<note place="margin">Job 30. 2.</note> 
                     <hi>Old Age is periſhed;

                     <note place="margin">Job 17. 1.</note> And this only is the ſtate
the Wiſe man here ſo Rhetorically

called good, I take to be the ſecond be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

to tell us wherein theſe miſeries particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conſiſt. I muſt here be neceſſitated to
go an untrodden path, and poſſibly an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable
one to ſome. As for all thoſe
Interpretations that are beſide the Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
you know I have already waved them,
and therefore ſhall not ſo much as mention
them in this verſe, nor in the whole enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Diſcourſe. As for thoſe that ſay, the
Sun, and the Light, the Moon, and the
Stars, ſignifie the ſeveral Ages that man
muſt paſs through, as was before hinted;
they make this Allegory, not ſo much a
deſcription of old age, as of the way to it,
and therefore are not to be admitted: for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as this is the deſcription of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and perfected decrepit age, as you
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:64566:20"/>
have already heard. There are that take
theſe Luminaries abſolutely literally, for
the ſeveral heavenly bodies as they ſtand
fixed in their Orbs, and differing from one
another in glory. But unto man in this
ſtate they are not really darkned, for as
they communicate of their light and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
equally both to the good and bad, to
the juſt and unjuſt; ſo alſo, to the young
and old, to the ſtrong man, and to the fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
by reaſon of his age. And then it
muſt of neceſſity be underſtood, <hi>per Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palagen,</hi>
only that they appear ſo to them,
by reaſon of their inability to receive their
light, and by reaſon of the weakneſs and
dimneſs of their outward ſenſe. And ſo
this opinion will in effect coincide with the
following, which is indeed moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
And that is, that theſe lights are
metaphorically here expreſſed, and do
principally allude to the lights of the body.
And this interpretation doth principally
and primarily ariſe and take its authority
from the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe; which is by
Interpretation as followeth: <hi>Antiquam
mutetur ſplendor gloriae faciei tuae qui aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulatur
ſoli, &amp; lumen oculorum tuorum
antequam obcaecetur, &amp; decor maxillarum
tuarum antiquam obtenebreſcetur, &amp; pupillae
oculorum tuorum qui aſſimulantur ſtellis
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:64566:20"/>
antequam extinguentur.</hi> And after this, men
of very great names have walked in the
ſame ſteps. But as moſt other Interpreters
ſeem to ſtrain the Metaphor too far, and
carry it beyond the ſignification of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
parts of man; ſo theſe ſeem to me
to draw it too ſtraight, while they keep it
within the compaſs of the external parts
of the body. And ſo much the rather,
becauſe by this Expoſition is intimated only
the change of the countenance towards de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity,
which is ſufficiently elſewhere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
as you will hear anon; and the
dimneſs of the ſight, which is far more
plainly expreſſed in the latter end of the
third verſe, <hi>nemine contradicente.</hi> And that
in this brief deſcription the Wiſe man
ſhould tautologize, is not to be ſuppoſed.
On the other hand, it is not to be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
that any infirmities appertaining to
this ſtate, eſpecially thoſe of the mind,
which are the greateſt of all, ſhould be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected
herein.</p>
               <q>Omni membrorum damno major dementia.</q>
               <p>Now as <hi>Delilah</hi> ſaid to <hi>Sampſon,</hi>

                  <hi>Thou haſt

told me wherein thy great ſtrength lyeth;</hi> ſo
might it be ſaid of <hi>Solomon,</hi> if he ſhould
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:64566:21"/>
take upon him to deſcribe any thing, and
do it but in part, and ſo deceitfully, that he
ſhould neglect the principal part, wherin
the great ſtrength lyeth; but I am other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
perſwaded; that he hath here told us
all his heart, and that there is no remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
infirmity, either of body or mind, that
belongs to age, which is not contained in
this Allegory. Now foraſmuch as all the
Symptomes in the four following verſes
belong properly to the parts of the body,
as you ſhall hear. I take this verſe to be a
deſcription of the infirmities of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
powers of the ſoul; and why moſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
do on ſet purpoſe avoid this Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation,
which is ſo plain and obvious in
this place, I cannot tell, unleſs it be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they are ſo much taken up with the
contemplation of the ſoul of man, that
they forget it hath any thing at all to do
with the body. There is a vaſt difference
between the ſoul of man as it is in its united
ſtate, and as it is in its ſtate of ſeparation. It
is not ſent from heaven into the body as an
aſſiſtant only, or like ſome tutelar angel, with
Commiſſion and full power to guard, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect,
and counſel that perſon, towards which
it is for a ſeaſon the deputed Miniſter.
For if ſo only, then it might recount and
tell us, how curiouſly it wrought for us in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:64566:21"/>
the lower parts of the earth, and what
wonderful <hi>Idaea's</hi> it had before it, to have
done further for us in that darkſome regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
had we been capable to receive them;
yea, then it might accompany us beyond
our pilgrimage, remaining in the body even
after diſſolution, and taking care for our
burials.</p>
               <p>But the Caſe is far otherwiſe, it is ſent to
inform the matter, and together with it to
make up one <hi>Compoſitum,</hi> the man being
not the one, nor the other; but moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
that which doth ariſe from the perfect
union of them both; and whatſoever is
predicable of the whole, is predicable of
the parts united; whatſoever may be ſaid
of the man, may be ſaid of the body and
ſoul united; and as they are throughly
joyned together, ſo they do intimately par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate
one with another, they are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
they are defiled together; they are
bound, they are looſed together; they
are well, they are ill together: If <hi>the fleſh

not only from the goods of the body,
and eſtate, but from thoſe alſo of the mind;
which hath nothing at beſt, but the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ground-work whereof at the leaſt,
is picked up from the Communication of
the outward ſenſes, and when thoſe pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Intelligencers fail, ſo alſo doth this
their Lord and Maſter. And therefore by
the Sun, Light, Moon, and Stars being
darkned, we do poſitively aſſert to be
meant, the moſt inward powers of the
mind, in this ſtate do, together with the
outward members of the body, weaken and
decay.</p>
               <p>But it may be here ſaid, is the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
man liable to this decay? Is there not
ſomething in man, while in this ſtate, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:64566:22"/>
independant of the body? and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
free from the frailties of age? Doth
not the Scriptures in many places ſeem to
ſpeak of renewed ſtrength in this ſtate of
weakneſs, and plainly prove, <hi>that while
the outward man decayes,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>the inward man
may be renewed day by day;</hi> for the right
underſtanding of this, and ſeveral ſuch pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
as theſe are, we muſt of neceſſity diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
of the inward man. There is the
inward man of the head, (as I beg favour
to ſay, ſince the ſoul of man there chiefly
doth exerciſe its principal faculties,) and
(ſince the other contradiſtinct term is ſo
appoſitely given in Scripture, <hi>viz.</hi>) the
inward man of the heart; plainly, there is
the inward man of nature, and the inward
man of grace; there is the inward man of
the firſt birth, and the inward man of the
ſecond birth, or of Regeneration. Now
I ſpeak here concerning the former of theſe,
that hath its decayes as age comes on, not
at all concerning the latter; And as I have
before excluded a ſtate of ſin from the
Text, ſo I do here wholly exclude a ſtate
of grace. The partial falling from divine
grace, is not ſo much as aimed at in this
place of Scripture, as the total not in any.
Moſt certainly true it is, that the work of
grace ſtands upon its own foundation, not
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:64566:23"/>
at all depending upon the principles of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
either for its Creation, or Reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
foraſmuch as the holy Spirit of

that clear ſhining part of man, whereby he
is differed from all other created beings

and this I underſtand by the Sun, and the
Light: And the other, <hi>viz.</hi> the leſſer
light, to rule the night of man, which is that
darker diſcerning part of man, that hath ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
little, or no light in it ſelf, neither doth
diſtinguiſh him from irrational Creatures;
And this I underſtand by the Moon;
he made the Stars alſo, as it followeth yet

               <div type="section">

                  <p>By the Sun, I underſtand here the moſt
ſuperiour power of the rational part of the
ſoul of man, that primary light of the

the ſpecies as they are communicated

no man that comes into the world, can ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
apprehend what is from without tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted

phantaſmes which are already impreſſed.
This we may ſee illuſtrated by the light of
the body, which is the eye: For in the eye
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64566:24"/>
there could be no perception of any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

Now that which this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted

the ſame doth this Sun of the ſoul in the

                     <hi>I pray God your whole ſpirit, ſoul and

is a difficult poynt, and hath gravelled
moſt undertakers, I will give one Eſſay
more, and that from Scripture-light, which
hitherto may not have been taken notice of,
to the preſent purpoſe; It is ſaid, <hi>The
Word of God is quick and powerful,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>and
ſharper than any two edged ſword, piercing
even to the dividing aſunder of ſoul and

Among many other truths this place doth
afford us this for one; That it is very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult
to divide or diſtinguiſh between the
ſoul and the ſpirit, becauſe there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
Communion and Conjunction
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:64566:24"/>
between them; ſuch an one, as in ſome
meaſure bears proportion with that, which
is between the joynts and the marrow.
Now becauſe this latter of the parts of the
body, (though hard in it ſelf,) yet is far
eaſier to be underſtood, then that former
of the parts of the mind, let us well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
this, and poſſibly it may give us ſome
light to the other. The joynts are the
turning places of the body, upon which
all the actions of the limbs are performed,
and therefore they are articulated ſeveral
waies, according as the poſition, alteration,
motion of the adjacent parts do require;
theſe are the moſt viſible acting parts of
the body; The marrow (by which we are
to underſtand not the <hi>medulla oſſium,</hi> the
marrow of the bones; but the <hi>medulla ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis,</hi>
the marrow of the back; for this
hath much more intimate communion and
conjunction with the joynts than the other
hath,) is the apprehending and inſtructing
part of the body, that which carries the
impreſſions of external objects to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
ſenſe, and reconveys the mandates
thereof to the members of the body, to
be put in execution upon the joynts.<note place="margin">D. Willis, c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whereupon all its operations, both ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

                  <p>By the light therefore, I underſtand all
thoſe more inferiour powers of the rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal

mentioned Sun; the Poſſible underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
alſo, in all its operations participates in
like manner of this ſtate of weakneſs.
Now the operations of mans underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
are various, both <hi>ad extra,</hi> in reſpect
of the Objects; and <hi>ad intra,</hi> in reſpect of
the will.</p>
                  <p>The firſt, are ſpeculative, the laſt, are
practical. The firſt (whereby the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
is converſant about things as they
have in their own nature a diſtinct being)
are principally three. The firſt is percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
or the ſimple apprehenſion of an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
from the immediate impreſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
by the miniſtry of the before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
Sun. The ſecond is Compoſition,
or Complexion, whereby we try, and
weigh the particulars that we have before
received, and compound, and divide, joyn,
and ſeparate one thing from another, as
may be moſt convenient for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of them, to their appointed ends.
The third is, reaſon, or diſcourſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:64566:26"/>
we gather up to our ſelves ſomewhat
farther than we underſtood before, and
make our ſelves maſters of a new and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
knowledge, which the things themſelves
received, as in themſelves, could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter.</p>
                  <p>The laſt (whereby the underſtanding is
converſant about things as they are good or
evil) may alſo be reduced to three. The
firſt is Conſcience, which is a reflection of
the underſtanding upon a mans actions, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with a ſentencing them to be good
or evil, according to thoſe unqueſtionable
principles which are already received.
This is the ſearch which the Candle of the
Lord makes in the lower part of the belly.<note place="margin">Prov 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

whereby the underſtanding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> doth propoſe
an end to be deſired and proſecuted, the
execution of which, that is, the reſting

means to attain that end, together with an
Inquiſition and Collation of ſeveral means
among themſelves, and an election of
thoſe which are moſt proper, the embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

Now theſe, and all the operations of
the rational ſoul, however they may be
diſtinguiſhed, have in this ſtate an anſwera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
imbecillity. Be a man never ſo appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive,

                  <p>Now as the ſoul is, by reaſon of age,
weakned in the directing part, which
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:64566:27"/>
uſually is called, the underſtanding; ſo alſo
in the executing part, which uſually is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
the will. Old men when they do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
an end, and the means to attain it,
they haeſitate about proſecuting the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates

is not a ready embracing, nor a free acting
towards the attainment of what is by the
underſtanding firſt dictated. Farther yet,
old men are very eaſily drawn off, and lead
aſide from their own intentions, every
weak ſuggeſtion is too ſtrong for them, and
takes them Captive at pleaſure; and as
our Saviour ſaid to <hi>Peter,</hi> though in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſenſe, ſo may it be ſaid to every one
who ſhall live to the time, <hi>When thou waſt

                  <p>And thus by theſe two words, the Sun,
and the Light, you perceive is meant, the
whole rational ſoul, with all its powers and
operations, as it may be found exerciſing
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:64566:28"/>
it ſelf both inwardly and outwardly. And
though here be two words more ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantly
ſet down, for the fuller and clearer
manifeſtation of what is here intended, yet
it might have been expreſſed (though not
ſo plainly) by one word only. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is, that the <hi>Syriack</hi> Tranſlation, and
ſome followers of it, have only the Sun
expreſſed: <hi>Antequam Sol obtenebreſcetur:</hi>
for the Sun may ſignifie, not only that
light which is contained within its own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
but all thoſe Emanations that illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
whatſoever is thereby enlightned.
And the womans Candle in the Goſpel, by
which ſhe found her groat, might ſignifie,
not only the light in the Candle it ſelf,
(which anſwereth here to the Sun,) but all
the light in every part of the room alſo,
(which anſwereth here to the light.) And
thus we find the greater light, which rules
the day of man, to be darkned; the
leſſer, which rules the night, is that which
followeth.</p>

confeſs, reaſon may in man have ſome
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:64566:28"/>
influence upon it, but in its own nature it
is altogether devoid of it; it is that part of
the ſoul which is uſually called ſenſitive,
and is common to all other animals as well
as unto man; and in him is but the leſſer
light, and ruleth but the darker part
only, and therefore may be moſt aptly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by the Moon. It is converſant
principally about thoſe ſpecies which are
communicated to it, from the outward
ſenſes; the operations about which are
either ſimple, or compound: The ſimple
operations are firſt to receive them as they
are communicated from without, and then
to retain them for ſo long time as it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing
it ſelf about them. Secondly, To di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate
them as they are in themſelves,
and to diſcern them as they differ from all
other whatſoever. The Compound ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
are excellently deſcribed by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern

the liberty of the Imagination is threefold,
Either Compoſition, or new mixing of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
Tranſlation, or new placing of them;
Creation, or new making them. Now all
theſe, or whatſoever elſe may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
within the compaſs of the pure
ſenſitive part of the ſoul, are but the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
of one faculty, and therefore by
one word, are moſt fitly here expreſſed.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:64566:29"/>
And though the Philoſophers have uſually
diſtinguiſhed them into more, as into the
common ſenſe, the Phanſie, both Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and Cogitative; yet really and truly
they are but one: for as one ſuperiour fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
in the ſuperiour part of the ſoul,
which is the underſtanding, could both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
compound, and collect, as you heard
before; what hindereth but the ſame may
be done in the ſame manner in the inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our?
And we are not to multiply faculties
without neceſſity: Beſide the ground of
their variety is not to be admitted. For
they ſuppoſed the operations about
their objects to be divers, attributing
perception and diſcerning to the common
ſenſe only, dividing and compounding to
the Phanſie.</p>
                  <p>Now the phanſie doth as well perceive
and diſcern, nay, better too, than the
common ſenſe doth; and the common
ſenſe may be ſaid to compound, and divide,
as the phanſie doth: Therefore ſome, more
quick ſighted of late, perceiving this ground
not ſufficient, that they might be ſure to
uphold <hi>Ariſtotles</hi> diviſion of the inward
ſenſes, have found out another way, and
ſay, that the common ſenſe is converſant
about a preſent object only, the Phanſie
about that which is abſent; but this ſeems as
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:64566:29"/>
weak as the former, and that according to
the Peripatetick Doctrine; foraſmuch as
the Phanſie is converſant about an object
only while preſent with it; Indeed it can
detain it a while, untill it have done its
work about it; ſo can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">

but for this it muſt be beholding to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and can do nothing upon an object
by its own ſtrength, but while it hath it
preſent with it. I argue this, only to ſhew
that they are but one faculty, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
by this one word, <hi>viz.</hi> the Moon,
they are both repreſented: which (as the
more ſuperiour powers of the ſoul, and all
the members of the body,) hath in this
ſtate of weakneſs its anſwerable declenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
I confeſs, with <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi>

man had a young mans eye, he would ſee
as well as a young man; but I deny that,
which I ſuppoſe he meant by it, that is, that
he would perceive and diſcern as well as a
young man, unleſs he had a young mans
internal faculty alſo. It is one thing, to ſee,
it is another thing, to know that a man ſees,
and to diſtinguiſh what colour, and what
figure he ſees. As age brings a weakneſs
upon the outward ſenſe, ſo that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſee, ſo alſo upon the inward, that they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:64566:30"/>
cannot diſcern could they ſee; And this is

his inward decay, I cannot diſcern;
and then his outward, I cannot taſte, nor
hear. It is proper to the outward ſenſe, to
taſte and hear; but it appertains to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
to know whether the objects both of
taſting and hearing, and of all the other
outward ſenſes, be good or evil. And
thus old <hi>Iſaac</hi> was impoſed upon, not only
in reſpect of the dulneſs of his outward
ſenſes, (all five of which are mentioned
in that one Chapter, where his younger
Son is ſaid to come with ſubtilty,<note place="margin">Gen. 27.</note> and take

of the weakneſs of his inward ſenſe, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in

All thoſe ſpecies whatſoever, either
rational or Imaginary, that (like the Stars
in their Orb) ſtand fixedly treaſured up in

pertain either to day or night, but are

or in the narrow and long contraction of
the viſible ſpecies, either by art, in glaſſes,

Stars give their light apparently at noon

they are the product of the day or

only to the night, hath not been a
more common miſtake among the Vulgar;
then that the memory belongeth only to

the ground of this miſtake hath principally
riſen from this; that they have given more
unto the memory, than properly doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long

it three operations, <hi>viz.</hi> Reception,

doth not only keep, what is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to it, (which indeed it doth moſt faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,)
but that it doth alſo take into cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody,
that which it keeps; and deliver it
up again, when called for; hereby making
the memory, both <hi>Candus,</hi> and <hi>Promus,</hi>
of the things therein contained, and giving
unto it ſuch a power, as many Noble men

more Maſters of what is contained in their

if we will divide aright, and give unto the

                  <p>And hence we may gather how ſad mans

mentioned in any age, and moſt difficultly
do they receive their cure; but in this they
admit of none at all. Some means may
be by Phyſicians uſed for the proroguing

that theſe do not intimate the rheums or
diſtillations from the eyes or head, falling
upon any of the ſubjected parts. It will
be enough plainly to declare, that theſe

of old age, do unceſſantly and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
ſucceed one upon another, as the
ſhowers in <hi>April.</hi> And they are placed
here in the midſt between the deſcriptions
of the infirmities of the mind which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:64566:33"/>
and thoſe of the body which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
follow; as having reference to
them both. Whereby we muſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand,
that all the infirmities that apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to this ſtate, whether they be thoſe of

follow one upon another, and one

The infirmities in this Allegory mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
if they ſhall at any time fall upon a
man in any other age, may poſſibly be
eaſed: And if ſo, there is good hopes that
they may be kept from redintegration, or
ever returning more; but in this age no
ſuch hopes; if their violence may poſſibly
be for a time remitted, yet they will as
certainly return again, as the clouds after
a rain in a rainy ſeaſon. Now when the
weather is (as we uſually ſay) ſet in to
rain, it is wonderful to ſee, how quick the
clouds will riſe and ride one after another,
and every one, the ſmalleſt of them,
pour down rain upon the earth beyond all
expectation. And if there ſhall be any
ſmall interval between ſhower and ſhower,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:64566:34"/>
and the Sun at any time begin to peep out
between the clouds, it is ſoon darkned
again; and the clouds return thicker and
blacker, and the ſhowers greater and lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,

moſt lively repreſentation of the infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the decrepit age of man; wherein

cannot long continue, but a greater dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

the ſinews: <hi>Thou haſt fenced me with bones
and with ſinews,</hi> but how they ſhall be ſaid
to tremble, is not to be made appear; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch
as experience doth ſufficiently
confirm, that they ſtand as fixed in old as
in young, and more fixed too. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
their Articulation, both to the <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi>
and alſo (and eſpecially) to the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tebrae</hi>
of the back, is ſuch, that they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of very little and obſcure motion, but
not at all of this trembling. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we muſt find out ſome other parts of
the body which are the conſtituted keepers
of the houſe; And they certainly can be
no other than <hi>the hands.</hi> Now the anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
hand contains not only the <hi>Carpus,
metacarpus &amp; phalanges digitorum,</hi> but the
whole ſuperiour <hi>artus;</hi> all thoſe higher
parts of the limbs that are divided from the
trunk of the body, and therefore it is well
divided in <hi>brachium, cubitum, &amp; extremam
manum.</hi> And theſe are they which moſt
properly are ſtiled the keepers or defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of the houſe; and that which makes
it the more unqueſtionable is, becauſe they
anſwer ſo directly to the ſtrong men, as it
follows in the next words. And theſe
hands and arms do ſeveral waies keep and
defend the houſe. And there is nothing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:64566:36"/>
more frequent in Scripture than the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
of defence by the power of the
hands and arms; when <hi>Jacob</hi> bleſſed his
Son <hi>Joſeph,</hi> he ſpake how he was defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
from them that beſet him, and ſaith,
<hi>His bow abode in ſtrength, the arms of his
hands were made ſtrong by the hands of the
mighty God of Jacob.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 49. 24.</note> And as if there
were no other way of expreſſing preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
defence, and deliverance, theſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
are almoſt alwaies mentioned, and
moſt frequently attributed to God himſelf;
<hi>They got not the Land into poſſeſsion by their

                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 44. 3</note> 
                     <hi>neither did their own arm ſave
them; but thy right hand, and thine arm,
becauſe thou haddeſt a favour for them.</hi> And
if there be any impotency in the hands and
arms, a man is no longer able to defend
himſelf; <hi>Job</hi> hath a moſt remarkable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
to confirm this truth; If ever he
uſed his defence and help to oppreſs the
Fatherleſs, he wiſheth that now he might
be left altogether helpleſs, and that his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders
might be taken from him, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
wholly unſerviceable to their ends;
<hi>If I have lift up my hand againſt the father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
when I ſaw my help in the gate,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 31. 21, 22.</note> 
                     <hi>then let
my arm fall from my ſhoulder blade, and my
arm be broken from the bone.</hi> Beſide this,
they may be ſaid to keep the houſe, in that
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:64566:37"/>
they provide for it, getting maintenance
for the whole body, for by working they
get bread.<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 3. 10. Acts 20. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Theſe hands have
miniſtred to my neceſsities.</hi> And as they
do defend the houſe, and provide for it;
ſo alſo they do offend whomſoever would
hurt it; they do not only get, but protect,
and alſo keep off the adverſary. And all
this was done at once by the power of the
hands of the Jews in their great neceſſity,
when they were rebuilding the Temple,
their hands were throughly filled, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in a double defence; <hi>For they which
builded on the wall,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Neh. 4. 17</note> 
                     <hi>and they that bare burdens,
with thoſe that laded, every one, with one of
his hands wrought in the work, and with the
other hand held a weapon.</hi> Now ſuch, through
the wiſdom of God, is the dexterity of the
hand, that it can employ a weapon to be a
better defence to a man, than whatſoever
is naturally allotted to any creature beſide.
And that audacious Carper at the works of
God (who complained that other Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
had naturally a defence given, and
man only left weaponleſs) was ſufficiently
ſilenced, when it was told him; Man had
reaſon and hands, which together, can
make a better defenſive or offenſive wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
for him, than all the horns, and hoofs,
the tusks, and talens, or whatſoever nature
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:64566:37"/>
hath more largely lent to other Creatures,
can do for them. And if we throughly
conſider the fabrick of theſe parts, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto what Anatomy doth give ſufficient
light unto, we ſhall yet farther be convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
of the truth of this matter. If we
conſider on the part of the bones, firſt the
<hi>Scapula,</hi> and take notice that it is ſeated
in the ſtrong part of the back, with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of motion in its place, in which it is
contained by the <hi>Clavicle,</hi> and with great
advantage of moving the arm which way
ſoever it pleaſeth; that it is formed with
its baſis, angles, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ibs, proceſſes, Cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
for the better ſeat of the muſcles, and
command of them to their appointed Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;
that it is articulated to the <hi>humerus
per Arthrodiam,</hi> wherein the Cavity is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportionate
to the head of the <hi>humerus,</hi>
that the ſhoulder may thereby with greater
facility and liberty admit of all manner of
motion, which it could not poſsibly have
done, had this articulation been any firmer
and cloſer in it ſelf. Now that this joynt
may be kept from luxation, either from it
ſelf, or from any thing might fall upon it,
to which it was very liable by reaſon of
what was before ſaid; It is ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended
by a very thick, and nervous liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
and by the broad Tendons of four
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:64566:38"/>
great Muſcles; which do ſo ſtrictly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
about the joynt, that by its own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
though never ſo violent, it cannot be
put out; and alſo by the Clavicle or ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
bone, which is ſo directly laid croſs
over it, that it defends it from all external
violence whatſoever. Again, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the <hi>humerus,</hi> its head, its neck, its
pullyes, its Cavities, its Extuberances;
If we conſider the <hi>Cubitus,</hi> and the <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi>
and their divers articulation; the
one being <hi>per ginglymum,</hi> which gives
flection and extenſion with ſtrength; the
other <hi>per arthrodiam,</hi> which gives pronati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and ſupination with eaſe. Laſtly, if we
conſider the bones of the extream hand;
and therein the eight bones of the <hi>Carpus,</hi>
which are joyned to the <hi>Cubitus,</hi> and to
the bones of the <hi>Metacarpus per arthrodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi>
among themſelves <hi>per harmoniam,</hi> if
we conſider the four bones of the <hi>Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carpus,</hi>
and their articulation to the fingers
<hi>per Enarthroſin,</hi> the fifteen bones of the
fingers, and their articulation among
themſelves, (for the firmer holding any
thing in the hand,) <hi>per ginglymum.</hi> Now
I cannot paſs the thumb in the general
name of the fingers, without a particular
and ſpecial taking notice of it; foraſmuch
as that above all the reſt both in its uſe,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:64566:38"/>
and alſo in its repute, may be ſaid to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
chiefly to the keeping of the houſe;
for it is equivalent to all the fingers, and
therefore in Latine is called, <hi>Pollex, à pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendo,</hi>
being as it were an antagoniſt graſper
to the whole hand, and doth as much to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the firm holding and dextrous uſing
of a weapon as all the hand: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is that idle perſons, or effeminate
men, or whoſoever are unfit for ſervice in
war; are called <hi>polletrunci;</hi> as who ſhould
ſay, men that have not the uſe of their
thumbs. And it was a Cuſtome among
the Nations, for the Conquerours to cut off
the thumbs of the Conquered, thereby
rendering them diſgraced, and utterly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for future employments either at Sea
or Land. And Scriptural Story alſo ſeems
to confirm this in <hi>Adonibezek,</hi> who ſaid,<hi>Threeſcore and ten Kings, having their
thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered
their meat under my table, as I have done,
ſo God hath requited me.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Judg. 1. 7.</note> Thus far on the
part of the bones. Again, if we conſider
on the part of the Muſcles; how they are
variouſly ſhaped and formed according to
their ſeveral uſes, how they are perforated
according to neceſſity, how they are ſeated
to the beſt advantage, how they are to one
another friends or antagoniſts, how they
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:64566:39"/>
are derived from one part, and inſerted
into another, how much ſtrength and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
they have, how by their hormetick
power and contraction into their own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
they can readily perform whatſoever
motion the Organ is capable of; they can
ſtir the limb inward, outward; forward,
backward; upward, downward; they can
perform adduction, abduction; flexion,
extenſion; pronation, ſupination, the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
motion, circumgiration; and all theſe
with ſo great expedition and agility, that
they are much ſooner done than ſaid, yea,
as ſoon done as thought on; the actions of
the Muſcles keeping pace, nay, many times
out-ſtripping the volubility of the mind:
If we yet further conſider them in their
<hi>Tendons,</hi> and the variety of them, how
they are either ſolid, plain, round, broad,
long, ſhort, one, many; or of whatſoever
form may render them moſt expeditious
in their motions; how they are ſtrengthned
by ſeveral Ligaments, eſpecially that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulary
Ligament in the Wriſt.</p>
                  <p>I ſay, if we conſider theſe wonderful
things, wherein man differs from all other
Creatures, and many others, which good
skill in the anatomy of theſe parts would
eaſily furniſh a man with, all which would
be too large here to inſert; It would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:64566:39"/>
us to ſay, that theſe of all the parts of
man do moſt properly defend him, and may
juſtly be ſtiled, the keepers of the houſe.</p>
                  <p>Now, that theſe may be ſaid to tremble,
needs no words to make appear, foraſmuch
as the experience of every old man doth
ſufficiently confirm it. Which word doth
comprehend within it ſelf all the weakneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
infirmities, inabilities of theſe parts
in this condition: Whether they be out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
as ſtiffneſs, contraction, rugoſity;
or inward, as aches, pains, numneſs, pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
cramps, tremblings; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
it hath, in a more eſpecial manner,
relation to that grand ſymptome, that
doth moſt certainly attend this condition;
which is called, <hi>Tremor artuum,</hi> the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
and unavoydable trembling of the
hands and arms. Now, foraſmuch as the
laſt age of man is eminently above all
others he paſſeth, the cold and the dry; it
muſt needs incline him, and at laſt moſt
certainly caſt him into this diſtemper.</p>
                  <p>For theſe two qualities, and, for ought
I underſtand, theſe alone, are the natural
fathers of this trembling child. If we
remember how going abroad in a bitter
cold morning, how drinking a great deal
of cold water, or ſwimming in the water;
if we know how the uſe of Poppies, Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:64566:40"/>
Opium, the cold fit of an Ague,
and other cold things, will eaſily ſet us a
ſhaking; if we conſider that long faſtings,
great evacuations, eſpecially Venerial,
which do moſt dry the Nerves, violent
heat in Feavers, fluxing by the uſe of
Quickſilver, immoderate ſweatings in hot
houſes, or elſehow; do cauſe the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper;
we ſhall be induced chiefly to
attribute this terrible ſymptome, to theſe
two deadly enemies of a well tempered
Conſtitution, coldneſs and dryneſs; which
are ſo contrary to the inſtruments of vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
motion, whoſe life and vigour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in radical heat and moyſture; that
they take off their ſtrength, and render
them unable to perform their duties, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
them ſo weak, that even the weight
of the member they are to move, is now
their equall Antagoniſt; for they going
about to move the member as they uſually
had done, are reſiſted with equal force by
the weight of that member; which cauſeth
as it were a continual combate between the
ſtrength of the mover, and the weight of the
moved, ſo that the Limb is alwaies drawn
one way by that, and another way by this,
which cauſeth a perpetual trembling of the
keepers of the houſe; which is reckoned
here as the firſt, and indeed is one of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:64566:40"/>
moſt remarkable ſymptomes upon the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

hard to ſay, whether he was in the body,
or out of the body,) he had ſuch a direct

might ſufficiently take off all other men,

this truth by an Anatomical Enarra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the ſeveral compounding parts of
theſe limbs, but foraſmuch as I did that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in the treating of the ſuperiour

there is a very great ſimilitude be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween

and what was there ſaid of them, as
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:64566:42"/>
unto the parts, and alſo unto the diſeaſes,
may for the moſt part be tranſlated hither,
and ſaid of theſe. And it is the principal
argument that induceth me to believe that
we are in the right in our Interpretation of
theſe two ſymptomes, becauſe of the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the parts we are ſpeaking of, and
alſo of the terms to expreſs them. It is
well known to all thoſe that take delight
to ſearch into the wonders of God in the
frame of mans body, that the Shoulders,
Arms, and Hands; and the Thighs, Legs,
and Feet are very much alike; ſo alſo are
theſe two expreſſions, <hi>the keepers of the
houſe,</hi> and <hi>the ſtrong men.</hi> The diſeaſes
alſo of theſe parts in Age are much-what
the ſame, and ſo alſo are the words that
here expreſs them. For although we tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlate

very little or nothing at all, but tranſlate
them both to trembling or ſhaking. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
give me leave to take notice briefly
of one or two things wherein theſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers

The bone of the thigh, is of all other
bones of the body the biggeſt and the
longeſt; and is called in Latine, <hi>Femur, à
ferendo,</hi> becauſe as a ſtrong man it doth
ſuſtain and bear the whole weight of the
body. It hath in the head of it three emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
proceſſes; The firſt is the great and
the round head, which is inſerted into the
large Cavity of the Hip, <hi>per Enarthroſin,</hi>
which admits of all manner of motion,
and there is detained by a double Liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
the firſt is common, broad, thick,
membranous, that doth ſtrongly compaſs
the joynt about, and the other is a round,
and Cartilagineous Ligament, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth
out of the very head of the <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi>
and being inſerted ſtrictly into the
Cavity of the <hi>Os Iſcii,</hi> doth firmly hold
this bone in its place, that it cannot be
moved. The other two proceſſes are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
the <hi>Trochanters,</hi> the leſſer, and the
greater; whereby the Tendons of the
Muſcles moving the thigh, are more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently
ſeated, that they may the better
wheel about that Limb to whatſoever po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
they pleaſe. It hath mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>eover at
the upper end a more ſlender part, which
is called the neck of the <hi>Femur,</hi> which is
ſo framed for the more convenient lodging
of the Muſcles, and paſſing of the Veſſels,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:64566:43"/>
(<hi>viz.</hi> the Arteries, Veins, Nerves,) for
the uſe and benefit of the ſubjected parts.
Its form alſo is moſt remarkable, in that
it is on the external or forepart, gibbous or
bunching outward; on the internal or hind
part, ſimous or bending inwards, which
frame doth wonderfully conduce to the
conveniency of ſitting, to the firmneſs
of ſtanding, and to the dexterity of walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, It is articulated to the <hi>Tibia, per
laxum ginglymum,</hi> which adds very much
to the expedition in motion, and is of ſuch
a frame, that on the back part it leaves a
moſt convenient hollow place, which we
call <hi>Poples,</hi> the ham, for the paſſing down
of the Veſſels; and on the fore part it is
wonderfully defended by the <hi>Patella,</hi> or
knee pan, as by a ſhield, the form, and
name of which, this bone doth continually
bear. And it is ſo much the more to be
obſerved, in that no ſuch bone is in the
ſuperiour <hi>Artus,</hi> nor in the whole body
beſides; for it is articulated to no bone at
all, but is kept in its place by a double Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gament,
the one inward, which is that
round, bloudy Ligament, which firmly
annexeth it to the thigh; the other out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
which is the Conjunction of the
Tendons of the four Muſcles which extend
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:64566:44"/>
the <hi>tibia,</hi> which together make a broad
Ligament that doth encompaſs the whole
knee, and ſtrongly bind it in its place;
wherein it exceedingly conduceth to the
defending of the joynt, over which it is
placed. For that Articulation being looſe
in it ſelf (as was before ſaid) would be very
apt to luxation in ſudden and great flexures
of the knee, or in going down ſteep places;
were it not by this ſhield bone abundantly
ſtrengthned, and ſufficiently defended from
all thoſe inconveniencies.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the Conjunction of the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bula,</hi>
being otherwiſe than that of the
<hi>Radius,</hi> which anſwereth it in the arm; is
well worth our obſervation to our preſent
purpoſe; the <hi>Radius</hi> of the arm is Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated
(as you have heard before) <hi>per
Arthrodiam</hi> to the <hi>Humerus,</hi> which renders
it more expeditious as to ſeveral motions,
and therefore more properly a keeper of
the houſe; but the <hi>Fibula</hi> is not at all Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulated
to the <hi>Femur,</hi> but is affixed to the
external part of the <hi>Tibia,</hi> and doth ſtand
as it were an underprop to that, whereby
they may joyntly with greater ſtrength
ſupport the whole body, and be the more
juſtly called, <hi>the ſtrong men.</hi> There is yet
one obſervation more from the Anatomy
of theſe parts, that doth with great delight
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:64566:44"/>
and content demonſtrate, that thoſe are
the keepers of the houſe, and theſe the
ſtrong men, and that is from the variety
of their flexures; the hand in all its ſeveral
joynts, is bended one and the ſame way;
the ſhoulder is bended inward, or foreward,
and extended outward or backward; ſo
alſo is the Arm, the Hand, the Fingers,
and this is for the better apprehending and
comprehending any thing, and uſing any
defence; and therefore they are the kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
of the houſe: The foot is bended in
its ſeveral joynts, ſeveral waies; one, one
way; and another, another; the thigh is
bended forward, the leg is bended back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
and again, the foot is bended for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
and the toes are bended backward;
and this is for the greater coveniency of
going, and for the firmer ſtanding, and
therefore theſe are the ſtrong men.</p>
                  <p>We might yet further and principally
confirm this thing, by the ſeveral forms
and uſes of the Muſcles of theſe parts; for
it is not ſo much great bones, nor great
veins, nor a great deal of bloud or fat, that
makes a man ſtrong; but great, and ſtrong,
and eminent Muſcles, they are the true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicators
of ſtrength. Now theſe parts of
the body have bigger, ſtronger, and more
raiſed Muſcles than any beſide; and by
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:64566:45"/>
how much the higher the Tendons of the
Muſcles are raiſed, with ſo much the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ſtrength muſt they needs perform their
Offices, and ſo much the more declare the
ſtrength of a man; and therefore we have
an ordinary obſervation, and a probable
one, to judge of a mans ſtrength, or
weakneſs, by the elevation or depreſſion
of the Calves of his legs. I might alſo
add many more obſervations of the like
kind; but I deſiſt, foraſmuch as a good
Anatomiſt can furniſh himſelf with enough;
and he that is none at all, can ſcarce under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
theſe, when he is told.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the great ſtrength of a man
lyeth in theſe parts, therefore in his infirm
and weak condition theſe parts muſt be
more eminently feeble.</p>
                  <p>A Child before ſtrength comes on,
and an old man after his ſtrength is depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
muſt have but little uſe of theſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.
As it was ſaid of <hi>Aſa, In the time
of his age,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Kings 15. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>he was diſeaſed in his feet;</hi> ſo
may it be ſaid of all who ſhall live to that
time. Now, foraſmuch as what was ſaid
before of the infirmities of the hands,
may alſo be ſaid of thoſe of the feet, I
ſhall chiefly refer you thither: However,
becauſe the word is here ſomewhat diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
tranſlated in our Language, and we
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:64566:45"/>
have no reaſon to complain, foraſmuch as
it doth primarily ſo ſignifie; ſo that ſome
have tranſlated it, <hi>Pervertentur,</hi> others,

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>;
I judge there is one grand ſymptome of
age that in this place, and upon theſe parts
is principally aimed at; and that is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertion,
crookedneſs, abbreviation, and
alteration of the poſition, of the ſeveral
joynts of theſe parts; and their inability
of being reduced to a firm, ſtrait, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick
poſture, wherein the ſtrength of a
man doth wholly conſiſt. And it is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
well worth our obſervation, that if a
man at his beſt and ſtongeſt eſtate, ſhould
be kept in that bending poſture, which age
neceſſarily binds every man unto; he, in
that condition, were ſcarce able to go, or
ſtand, without the help of a ſtaff; and the
reaſon of it is plain, becauſe the Center of
gravity is not equally poyſed upon the <hi>baſis</hi>
of the feet; but hangeth as a weight be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
and therefore had need of another
<hi>Fulciment,</hi> upon which it might the more
firmly reſt. And therefore it is ſaid of old
men: <hi>Membra levant baculis;</hi> when theſe
members are perverted in their joynts, and
the tone of the Muſcles is ſo much relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
that they are unable to bring them to
ſtraitneſs again, there is great need of the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:64566:46"/>
ſupport of a ſtaff; for without it, there is
an utter inability of going ſteadily, and
ſtanding ſtrongly, which is the principal
ſymptome intimated by the ſtrong mens
bowing themſelves.</p>

                  <p>That there may in mans body be other
grinding, than maſtication, or chewing the

than the jaws and teeth, <hi>the enſuing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;</hi>
and that there can be no other in
this place intended, <hi>this preſent Diſcourſe,</hi>
I hope will make appear. Grinding all
men know to be performed by two hard
bodies, the one immoveable, upon which
the grinding is made; the other moveable,
which by ſtrong Compreſſion againſt the
former, and by its motion, makes the
grinding; ſo that to it, there is neceſſary
both theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> the firm ſtander, and the
ſtrong mover; the upper, and the nether
milſtone, as we have them often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
in Scripture;<note place="margin">Deut. 24. 6.</note> now anſwerable unto
theſe in the mill, there are for that grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
which is performed in the mouth; two
jaw bones, which are called the upper and
nether <hi>Mandible.</hi> The upper Mandible,
is compounded of eleven ſeveral bones,
which among themſelves, and to thoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:64566:46"/>
are joyned either <hi>per ſuturam,</hi> or
<hi>harmoniam,</hi> which admit of no motion at
all, and therefore this ſtands firmly in its
place, and is that immovable milſtone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which the grinding is made; the nether
Mandible is one ſingle, hard, and ſtrong
bone, whoſe Articulation is very looſe, for
the greater liberty of motion; and it hath
two or three pair of Muſcles, eſpecially
the <hi>Temporal,</hi> which ſtrongly bring it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
for the cloſer acting againſt the
other Mandible, and one wonderful pair of
Muſcles, called, the <hi>Maſſeters,</hi> and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from a double original, and beyond
all others of the body whatſoever, have
their ſeveral Fibres ſo croſſing and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven
one with another, that they are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verally
inſerted into this lower Mandible,
and ſo are able to move it upward; to the
right, to the left; forward, backward, and
conſequently round about, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
that action which we call Maſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or chewing, and therefore this is that
other movable milſtone which makes the
grinding.</p>
                  <p>Now out of both theſe, equally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in the ſeaſon of them a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of ſmall bones which we call the
Teeth; which howſoever they may be
numbred among the bones, yet they have
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:64566:47"/>
one or two eſpecial properties which are
competible to no other bones of the body,
(at leaſt in that meaſure,) whereby they
are principally adapted for the grinding.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, they are naked, they have
no covering or skin upon them, no not ſo
much as that common Membrane, called,
the <hi>Perioſtion,</hi> which doth encompaſs all
the bones of the body beſide; and that is
becauſe they might the better atting one
anothers bodies, and in their attrition
one againſt another they might feel no pain;
but I muſt needs here take notice that the
words of <hi>Job</hi> ſeem to be againſt me, where
he ſaith,<note place="margin">Job 19. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>I have eſcaped with the skin of my
teeth;</hi> This is eaſily anſwered, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the two parts of the Teeth, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<hi>Baſis,</hi> and the <hi>Radix; that,</hi> is the part
which eminently appears white above the
Gums; <hi>this,</hi> is that part which is within
the Gums, and ſtands fixed in the Mandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles:
Now by <hi>Jobs</hi> skin or covering of
his teeth, it is apparent he meant the gums
which cover the roots of the teeth; his
ſores, and his boyls were ſo great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
upon him, from the ſole of his foot
to his Crown, that there was no part of
the skin of his body to be ſeen, but only
about his teeth, which in all ſuch Cutaneous
diſeaſes doth for the moſt part wholly
eſcape.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:64566:47"/>
The ſecond is, they have the veſſels
which convey life and ſenſe unto them,
contained only in the inward parts, that the
outward parts may be freer and better to
grind.</p>
                  <p>The third is, that they are growing or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
ſo long as man lives, ſo that what
is worn away of them by their continual
attrition and manducation; is dayly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
otherwiſe they would grow ſhorter
and ſmoother, and not be ſo able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
their work; and this is a wonderful
piece of the wiſdom of God in nature,
which Art cannot poſſibly reach unto;
and therefore becauſe they cannot make
their mills grow, as they dayly decay by
grinding; they are fain to ſupply that
want, by often pecking their milſtones,
and at length changing them; and by thoſe
means as it were renew their teeth, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which they were able to do nothing
at all.</p>
                  <p>The laſt I ſhall mention is, that the teeth
of all the bones of the body are the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
and will ſuffer the leaſt from any
other bodies whatſoever, and therefore are
the fitter for ſuch a work as this. A mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
is of all other ſtones ſuppoſed to be
the hardeſt, and therefore <hi>Job</hi> when he
had expreſſed the hardneſs of the heart of
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:64566:48"/>
the Leviathan by a ſtone; as if he had not
ſaid enough, he farther adds one degree
more, yea, ſaith he, <hi>As hard as a piece of
the nether milſtone.</hi> Theſe ſhort obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
may ſuffice to teach us in the general,
that the teeth alſo may be called the grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.
If we yet more particularly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them, and how they may be divided,
we ſhall have a farther light into this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The teeth are of three kinds, either
<hi>Inciſores, Canini,</hi> or <hi>Molares:</hi> The firſt
are the broad fore-teeth; the ſecond are
the next round teeth, which are uſually
called the eye-teeth; the laſt are the great
double and hindermoſt teeth; the firſt,
bite or cut the food; the ſecond, break or
bruiſe the food; the laſt, chew or grind
the food. And this diſtinction alſo may
be found in Scripture, the firſt are alluded
to, where it is ſaid, <hi>The Prophets bite with
their teeth.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mic. 3. 5.</note> The ſecond, where it is ſaid,
<hi>He hath the cheek teeth of a Lion:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joel 1. 6.</note> And
both theſe, where it is ſaid, <hi>There is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
whoſe teeth are as ſwords, and their
jaw teeth as knives.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov 30: 14.</note> The laſt is alluded to,
where it is ſaid, <hi>While the fleſh was yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
their teeth, ere it was chewed, the
wrath of the Lord was kindled againſt the
people.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Num. 11. 33.</note> They had bit the fleſh of the
Quails, and had paſſed it from the firſt
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:64566:48"/>
teeth, to the laſt, which are the grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and there it ſtuck till they died. And
thus at length we are fallen upon the true,
proper, and ſtrict inſtruments of grinding;
we have hitherto been ſhewing the whole
frame of the mill, and how ſeveral parts
do wonderfully contribute towards this
work, and now we are come to thoſe parts,
wherein the cloſe pinch of grinding lieth,
and that is in the great, broad, and hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
teeth, which from the day of the
writing of this Allegory, to this preſent
time, have ever among Anatomiſts retai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the name of grinders.</p>
                  <p>And that not without exceeding good
reaſon, for the form and figure of theſe,
above the reſt doth abundantly ſhew that
theſe are the fitteſt of them all for this
work; for theſe are bigger, larger, broader
every way; eſpecially at the top, where their
form is much-what like to that of a mill,
where alſo they have eminent aſperities, &amp;
protuberances, exactly anſwerable to the
roughneſs of the Milſtones; by which the
grinding is far more eaſily and perfectly
performed; beſide, theſe are more firmly
inclavated, and infixed into the jaw bones,
by treble, or quadruble roots; whereas
all the reſt are but by ſingle, or double at
the moſt; and being more ſtrongly rooted,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:64566:49"/>
they are the fitter for more eminent ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices;
Laſtly, and chiefly, the experience
of every man doth ſufficiently confirm
that this is the proper uſe of theſe teeth;
and that the more ſolid food which needs
greater manducation, cannot be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
comminuated for chyle, or ground low
enough for the ſtomack, untill theſe teeth
have done this work upon it. And thus it
is plain, that the jaws, and teeth, and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
theſe laſt mentioned, are appoſitely
and elegantly called the grinders; which
how much ſervice they do to man while
uſable, and how much detriment and loſs
they bring upon him when they ceaſe from
their uſe, is well known to all men.
<hi>Strong meat belongeth to men of full age,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 5. 14</note>
ſaith the Author to the Hebrews. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs
to them, and only to them, becauſe
they alone, have, as I may ſo ſay, their
mill in tune, their mouth full of ſtrong
teeth, and ſet directly one againſt another,
whereby they may bring the ſtrongeſt meat
into a meet conſiſtence, and a due prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
for eaſie digeſtion in the ſtomack.
But it may here be ſaid, there are many
Creatures that are not thus ſtrongly armed,
and have not ſo many teeth, nor thoſe
they have ſo well ſet, as your poſition
ſuppoſeth they ſhould be, for the due
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:64566:49"/>
preparation of the meat; And theſe are
the Sheep, the Goat, the Cow, the Deer,
and all other Creatures that have teeth
only on the lower Jaw, and none at all on
the upper. Theſe have no antagoniſt grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
nor contra-acting milſtones, and yet
theſe Creatures in their full age, eat as
ſolid food, and as hard of digeſtion, and
withall, do as well with it, as they that
are better provided in this reſpect; to this
I muſt needs anſwer, it is very true, ſo that
from hence we may take occaſion to admire
the wiſdom of God in the various forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſeveral Creatures, tending not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
to the uſe and benefit of them
all. However this in theſe Creatures is a
want, and muſt have ſtood for a want, had
they not been abundantly ſupplyed in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
kind. For all thoſe Creatures that
are thus deficient in their teeth, and only
thoſe; are they which chew the Cud,
which is a reaſſuming the food into the
mouth, and a grinding of it a freſh the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
time, ſo that they are fain to do that
at twice, and to be three or four times as
long about it, as thoſe creatures whoſe grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
are better placed; neither would this
ſuffice alone, for if they ſhould be chewing
their meat all the day long with the teeth
that they have, it would never be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:64566:50"/>
prepared for nouriſhment, were there
not yet a farther preparation in their bodies
for that purpoſe; and that is, that thoſe
Creatures, and only thoſe, have a peculiar
veſſel in their bodies aſſigned for this work,
and that is that which Anatomiſts call,
<hi>Oma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>um,</hi> and our Butchers, the <hi>Read;</hi>
wherein the meat muſt be macerated for a
certain ſeaſon, and by the <hi>fermentum</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
contained, brought to ſuch a Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence,
that afterwards by a little chewing
in the mouth again, it may be committed
to the ſtomack with the ſame hopes of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
that in other Creatures that are
toothed on both ſides, it is committed at
the firſt: Now, man being in the number
of theſe laſt mentioned, muſt for the due
preparation of all ſtrong food, truſt alone
to his grinders; ſo that the time of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lactation
of the child, and of alteration
of the diet of the old man, is moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
indicated by the beginning and cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of the uſe of the Teeth; milk is fit for
babes, before their teeth come; and old men
when their teeth decay,<note place="margin">Heb. 13. 14.</note> are again <hi>become ſuch
as have need of milk, and not of ſtrong meat.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now by the ceaſing of the teeth we muſt
underſtand, all thoſe infirmities that are
incident to them by reaſon of age, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
looſeneſs, hollowneſs, rottenneſs,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:64566:50"/>
brokenneſs, blackneſs, foulneſs, ſtench,
wormeatenneſs, excreſcency, or whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
elſe may be any impediment to them
in their uſe. But the chief ſymptome here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
is, the falling out, and conſequently,
the paucity of the teeth; which is gathered
from the reaſon here annexed, <hi>Becauſe
they are few;</hi> which is very well tranſlated
in our Language, following the Vulgar
Latine; <hi>Otioſae erunt molentes in minuto
numero.</hi> For although the Original word
do primarily ſignifie no more than becauſe
they are diminiſhed, yet it muſt of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
be underſtood, in reſpect of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
for otherwiſe they are not diminiſhed,
but do grow ſo long as they remain in the
head, even to the extremity of old age.
But as age comes on, the natural moyſture
at the root of the teeth is conſumed, and a
preternatural is diſtilled thither in its room,
which doth by degrees relax them in their
ſockets, and at length quite expell them:
And when ſome of them are thruſt out,
and but a few left in, it is eaſie to conceive
from what hath been ſaid, how the chew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the mouth ceaſeth; yea, it ceaſeth
more, when the teeth are few, than when
they are none at all. For then the Gums
might act one againſt another, and, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as they grow harder in old age, might
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:64566:51"/>
do ſomething weakly towards the chewing
of the meat; but when they are few, they
hinder thoſe from working in the leaſt, and
having no antagoniſts (were they firm in the
head which they are not) are not able to
work themſelves, and ſo the whole grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
ceaſeth; which is a very great and
moſt certain ſymptome of this ſtate of
weakneſs, and yet is neglected by our
great Maſter of natural knowledge in this
kind,<note place="margin">Hippo. l. 3. Apho. ult.</note> in his beſt enumeration of the diſeaſes

                  <p>That by this clear expreſſion the eyes
and the infirmities of them in old age, is
intimated unto us, was never yet, and I
perſwade my ſelf never will be, in the leaſt
meaſure doubted or queſtioned.</p>
                  <p>Foraſmuch as they are the only true, and
proper Organs of ſeeing; however, it
will be well worth our labour to conſider,
how the eyes may be called, the lookers
out of the windows. One may be ſaid to
look out of a window in a double ſenſe,
either when he looks through the glaſs of
the window, and through the pellucidity
of that moſt refined body, diſcerneth
thoſe things which are without; or when
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:64566:51"/>
he looks through the open Caſement, or
through ſome open hole of the window,
wherein there is nothing at all interpoſeth
between him and the object. Now in both
theſe ſenſes may our interpretation well be
made. For the Explication of it in the
firſt ſenſe, we muſt take notice of all thoſe
tranſparent parts, through which the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſpecies muſt of neceſſity paſs before
viſion can be perfected: For as a man
could ſee nothing through a window, were
it not made of glaſs, or of ſome body alike
Diaphanous: So neither could he perceive
any thing with his eye, were not the parts
thereof, through which paſſage is made, of
the very ſame nature. Now, the parts
of the eye, through whoſe bodies the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
ſpecies muſt paſs that they may be
diſcerned, are either the <hi>humours,</hi> or the
<hi>Tunicles;</hi> The <hi>Humours</hi> are three, the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi>
the <hi>Crystalline,</hi> and the <hi>glaſsie</hi> hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
ſo called by Anatomiſts; and you
may perceive by their names that the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of them all is Diaphanous; all
which, howſoever they wonderfully differ
among themſelves, and ſeveral waies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
to the uſe and benefit of the eye,
and conſequently are made variouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental
unto viſion, yet they all agree
in this one thing, that they are tranſparent;
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:64566:52"/>
and that they muſt of neceſſity do, foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
as into their bodies, and through
their bodies, muſt the viſible ſpecies paſs,
before they can perfectly be diſcerned by
any man. And if one opacous, or dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
body interpoſeth, they can go no
further, but there they muſt determine
their courſe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Tunicles or Coats,</hi> through which
the ſight is made, are only two, for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there are other Tunicles of the
eye, which conduce wonderfully to the
ſight, (as you ſhall hear beneath,) yet
thoſe through which the ſpecies paſs, are
only the <hi>Tunica Aranea,</hi> and the <hi>Cornea.</hi>
The firſt is ſo called from the ſimilitude of
a Spiders Web, becauſe it is moſt fine and
ſubtile, and being derived from the Brain
and Optick Nerve, it becomes a moſt te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous
veſtment for the humours; and is
ſo pellucid, and tranſparent, that among
the Learned it bears the name of <hi>Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum.</hi>
The other is called, <hi>Sclerotica,</hi> or
<hi>Cornea;</hi> and that is, that hard and horny
Membrane, which being derived from the
<hi>dura mater,</hi> encompaſſeth the whole body
of the eye, without any perforation; and
on the back part, behind the ſight of the
eye, is more obſcure and dark; but on
the forepart, is far more plain, polite, and
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:64566:52"/>
diaphanous, that the ſpecies may paſs
through its body moſt pure and unaltered.
And now I am come to that part of the
eye, that doth moſt aptly reſemble the
glaſs of the window, by reaſon of which
a man may be truly ſaid to look through a
window, and an old man,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>to ſee through a
glaſs darkly,</hi> without the uſe of Spectacles,
which ſome would fain have here to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood;
of whoſe opinion I cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
my ſelf to be, becauſe it is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
to me, whether thoſe helps of nature
were then, and there, in uſe: And moſt
certain it is, that they are without the
compaſs of the Allegory, and are not part
of that houſe or body of man, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay
is here ſo lively repreſented. Beſide,
this Tunicle hath the ſame uſe to man, in
his perfect ſtate, that Spectacles have in
his imperfect. And this be confident of,
that there is nothing that Art hath found
out to help man in his decayes, that hath
not its footſteps firſt in Nature, and is not
an imitation of thoſe things in man, that
were moſt compleatly in him in his perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
And here I muſt of neceſſity go
one ſtep farther, than our common Ocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts;
who aſcribe to this part but a low
and a mean office, which is only to keep
the humours <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> their place, or at the beſt,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:64566:53"/>
to defend the inward parts from external
injuries; but without all queſtion, it hath
this farther, and more noble uſe, <hi>viz.</hi> ſo
to diſpoſe and order the viſible ſpecies, that
they may in the moſt convenient manner,
make their impreſſion upon the proper Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
of ſight; and this their Craſſitude or
thickneſs, together with their Convexity
or bending outward, doth ſufficiently make
appear. I here all along retain the term of
the Ancients, <hi>viz. viſible ſpecies,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
moſt known, and that by which I may
be better underſtood among moſt, to
whom this Paraphraſe may come, though
it be not ſo proper, and the Conceptions
which they had about them, are not to be
admitted; for there is no new Entity, either
material, or immaterial, caſt off from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
diſtinct from it, &amp; from the light, which
is the cauſe of viſion in the eye; by the
<hi>viſible ſpecies</hi> therefore, I mean no more,
than the ſeveral beams of light being ſo
reflected from the object, as that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
fully fraught with the repreſentation
of it, (not only in reſpect of the proper
object of ſight, which we call colour, but
of theſe common ones alſo, which we call
ſituation, figure, diſtance, bigneſs, and
the like,) and have a compleat power of
impreſſing the ſame upon the <hi>Retina,</hi> which
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:64566:53"/>
is the ſtrict and proper Organ of ſight, and
is nothing elſe than the dilation of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Nerve all about the bottom of the
eye. For the better underſtanding of all
which, we muſt know that the ſpecies paſs
along the medium in a Pyramidical figure,
and as they are caſt off from one point of
the Superficies of the object in a Cone, ſo
they muſt be reduced again in the ſame Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
figure upon one and the ſame point of
the Organ; which reduction is performed
by that collection, refraction, and directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which hapneth to them in thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
pellucide bodies through which they
paſs, and primarily (while the eye remains
in its vigour) in the <hi>Tunica Cornea;</hi> but as
age enfeebleth the eye, the form and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure
of it becomes more plane and depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
than it was before; and the Cryſtalline
humour, which had a power of reducing it
ſelf, and conſequently the whole body of
the eye, to a more oblong and Convex
ſhape, becomes dry, and altogether unable
for ſuch an end; ſo that now the Species
caſt off from the object at a convenient di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
cannot be brought to a Cone upon
the Organ, which muſt needs breed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
in the fight: To avoid which conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
old men hold the object that they
look upon at a greater diſtance from the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:64566:54"/>
eye, becauſe ſo, the preſent Conſtitution
of the eye can better regulate the Species;
and thus alſo Spectacles are placed before
the eye to collect, refract, and guide the
Species, that they may point together
upon the <hi>Retina;</hi> which by how much the
thicker, and more Convex they are, by
ſo much the more powerfully do they do
this work: And therefore as age encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
and the form of the Cryſtalline hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour,
and of the whole eye is more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed,
ſo much the thicker, or ſo much
the more Convex, or both, muſt the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacles
be made, that they may be anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the age. And this is done only
in imitation of that, which is far more
perfectly done while man abides in
ſtrength, by the hard Membrane we are
now treating of; and this is the firſt ſenſe
in which the eyes may be called the lookers
out of the windows.</p>
                  <p>The other is, that whereby they may
be ſaid to look <hi>through the holes</hi> of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
when there is an open paſſage, and
nothing at all interpoſeth between them
and the object. And this indeed is the
moſt proper reading of the words. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>
ſignifieth <hi>in foraminibus,</hi> or as the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
Latine, <hi>per foramina;</hi> and the Seventy,
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Now there are ſeveral waies,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:64566:54"/>
whereby the eye may be ſaid to look in, or
through the holes.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is, in reſpect of their ſeat, or
the form of that place, in which they are
fixed in the head. And if we ſhould ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
hold the word to that interpretation of
<hi>in foraminibus,</hi> or the lookers in the holes,
nothing could be ſo applicable as this; and
hereunto to be ſure the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe
hath reference, <hi>Qui vident per Cancellos
Capitis tui,</hi> thoſe that look in, or through
the ſtrong bounds of the head, which can
be no other, than thoſe firm holes, or
arches, which are made in the fore-part of
the head, for that very purpoſe, <hi>viz.</hi> to
receive into their Cavities the whole body
of the eye: And theſe are by Oculiſts cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Orbitae,</hi> and are each of them compoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
of ſix ſeveral bones, which, being moſt
conveniently ſuturated among themſelves,
do make up thoſe curious arched chambers
in which theſe lookers or beholders dwell,
in which, and from which, they may be
aptly ſaid to perform their offices. And
to theſe alluſion is had in the Plague where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
the Lord will ſmite thoſe that fight
againſt <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Zach. 14. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Their fleſh ſhall conſume
away while they ſtand upon their feet, and
their eyes ſhall conſume away in their
holes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="94" facs="tcp:64566:55"/>
Secondly, They may be ſaid to look in,
or through the holes; in reſpect of the
<hi>palpebrae</hi> or Eye-lids; for although the uſe
of the eye-lids is to cover or cloſe the eyes,
ſo that they are called, <hi>Oculi ab oculendo,
vel occultando,</hi> becauſe they lye hid under
their lids; yet whenſoever the eye is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed
in ſeeing, they muſt depart one from
another, and ſo leave an open hole through
which the ſight may be made. And thus
every man diſcerns in himſelf that he can
take away ſight, or cauſe it at pleaſure, by
drawing, or withdrawing; by letting
down, or pulling up, theſe ſhutters of the
windows. And it is wonderful to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how ready they are in this work, that
they might be no impediment to viſion, ſo
that an inſtantaneous action is no way bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
expreſſed, than by the motion of the
eye lids:<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15. 52.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold I ſhew you a myſtery, we
ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be changed
in a moment, in the twinckling of an eye.</hi>
And when we look earneſtly upon any
thing, we ſteadfaſtly keep the windows
open; and a ſhut eye, in Scripture phraſe,
ſignifieth impoſibility of ſeeing;<note place="margin">Iſa. 6. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Shut their
eyes leſt they ſee;</hi> and an open eye ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth
power of looking or beholding;<note place="margin">2 King. 6. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>Open
the eyes of theſe men,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eliſha, that they
may ſee, and the Lord opened their eyes,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:64566:55"/>
and they ſaw, and behold they were in the
midst of Samaria.</hi> And a Seer, and a man
whoſe eyes are opened, are the ſame thing,
<hi>Balaam the ſon of Beor hath ſaid,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Num. 24. 3, 4.</note> 
                     <hi>and the
man whoſe eyes are open hath ſaid, he hath
ſaid, who heard the words of God, who ſaw
the viſion of the Almighty, falling into a
trance, but having his eyes open;</hi> And thus
alſo may the eyes be ſaid to look through
the holes, and all thoſe that have taken
exact notice of the <hi>Foramina Cutis</hi> in the
body of man, have been ſure not to neglect
theſe.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, They may be ſaid to look
through the holes, in reſpect of that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Membrane of the eye, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Adnata,</hi> or <hi>Conjunctiva,</hi> and this is
that which being divided from the <hi>Pericra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium,</hi>
is next of all to the <hi>Orbita,</hi> and
firmly holdeth the eye in that Cavity, it
encompaſſeth the eye round on the back
part, and on the fore-part ſo far as the
white of the eye goeth, and no further,
and ſo leaveth the whole <hi>Iris,</hi> the rainbow,
or party-coloured part of the eye, as an
open hole, which the viſible ſpecies may
freely without interruption paſs through;
the truth of this any one may diſcern in the
inflammation of the eyes, for that is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe
for the moſt part ſeated in this part
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:64566:56"/>
alone; then you may ſee the veins and the
Arteries very red and ſwollen, ſo far as
this Membrane or the white of the eye
reacheth, and the <hi>Iris</hi> or darker part of the
eye in the mean while wholly free.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The eyes may be ſaid to look
through the holes in reſpect of the <hi>Pupilla,</hi>
or the apple of the eye, which is nothing
elſe, but an open hole in one of the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verings
of the eye, as I may ſay, bored for
that very purpoſe, that the lookers through
the windows might have an open view;
for that Covering which is called <hi>Tunica
Uvea,</hi> is a thick, and a cloſe, a dusky, and
a dark Membrane, through which the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
Species, or the light cannot eaſily
make its way. And therefore on the back
part its uſe is to preſerve, and to keep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
the innate light of the eye, and
alſo to give a ſtop to the viſible ſpecies, ſo
that they can paſs no farther, but muſt
there impreſs their Images; like the lead,
or the ſteel, or whatſoever elſe is put on
the backſide of the Looking-glaſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which there can be no impreſſion made;
but on the fore-part it is moſt convenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
perforated, and at ſuch a proportion,
that the light or the ſpecies through it have
freedom of acceſs: which perforation is
the apple of the eye, that wonderful part,
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:64566:56"/>
which is ſo often noted in Scripture to be
above all other parts of the body tendered
and obſerved,<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 10. Pſal. 17. 8 Pro. 7. 2.</note> and therefore here I would
principally take notice of it; and of all the
parts of the eyes, and of all the holes
through which they look, let this be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
accounted the moſt obſervable. For
it may be dilated or contracted as it may be
conducible to a more perfect ſight; if
there be requiſite thereunto, a greater or a
leſſer light; if the object we would look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
be farther off, or nearer to the eye; or if
we do more careleſly or curiouſly look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; this hole is preſently made wider or
narrower; that it may be the more ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
for the preſent occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, They may be ſaid to look
through the holes in reſpect of the <hi>Optick
Nerves,</hi> for theſe above all the other
Nerves of the body are apparently perfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated;
and although neither theſe, nor any
other, doth ſo appear in a body that hath
been long dead, yet doubtleſs they have
open paſſages while the body is yet alive,
foraſmuch as they are the Conveyers of
matter, though more pure and refined,
from one part unto another, as the other
Chanels of the body are. And here the
Cavity and Poroſity of the Optick nerves,
ought as well to be reckoned among the,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:64566:57"/>
holes through which ſight is made, as any
other that are placed before the proper Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
upon which the repreſentation of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
objects is firſt made, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
there can be no perfect perception of
any thing, unleſs the impreſſion made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Senſory be truly conveyed into the
moſt inward receſſes of the brain, where
the ſoul makes its ſeat of judicature. For
as all the things in a Chamber may have
their firm repreſentation in a glaſs that
ſtands upon the Table, yet if any thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe
between me and the glaſs, I di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern
nothing at all; and they are all as
much hid from me, as if they had never
been there repreſented. And thus we
know a total obſtruction of the Optick
Nerve, which is called, <hi>Gutta Serena,</hi>
makes as perfect a blindneſs, as an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of the humour <hi>Aqueus,</hi> which is
called, a <hi>Cataract;</hi> And thus I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to ſhew, and that I hope with ſome
ſatisfaction, how the eyes may be called,
the lookers through the windows. Now
as age comes on and encreaſeth, it is well
known to all men how ſight goeth away
and decreaſeth; the lookers out of the
windows muſt aſſuredly be darkned, and
by how much the more excellent theſe
parts are, by ſo much the more apparent
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:64566:57"/>
are their decayes. It is ſaid of the heart,
it is <hi>primum vivens,</hi> and <hi>ultimum moriens;</hi>
but contrariwiſe it may very well be ſaid of
the eye, that it is <hi>ultimum vivens,</hi> and
<hi>primum moriens.</hi> This moſt wonderful
and tender part of man, in that it hath
more curious and more various work in its
formation, is the laſt that lives; and in that
it hath need of more life and vigour, more
firmneſs and purity in its operation, it is
the firſt that dieth; and indeed the inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
encroach of age, is no where ſo ſoon
diſcovered, as in the eye; and men are
loath to think themſelves declining in age
ſo ſoon as the eye gives warning thereof;
and we have ſcarce any deſcription of an
old man by his infirmities, wherein thoſe
of the eye are not principally mentioned:
When <hi>Iſaac, Jacob, Eli,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 27. 1 Gen. 48. 10. 1 Sam. 3. 2.</note> and others are

whatſoever may either incraſſate the dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous
bodies before mentioned, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
them leſs tranſparent; or ſtop the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
perforations, and ſo hinder that open
view: muſt of neceſſity cauſe a diminuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
and in time a perfect abolition of the
ſight; and here give me leave to name
one or two principal ſymptomes of viſion
that are the chief attendants of this declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:64566:58"/>
ſtate; The firſt is <hi>Caligo,</hi> which is the
obſcurity of viſion by reaſon of the Craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitude
or thickneſs of the <hi>Tunica Cornea;</hi>
which by reaſon of the drineſs of age doth
together with the nails of the fingers,<note place="margin">Fernel.</note> grow
darker and thicker, and conſequently loſe
dayly ſomewhat of its perſpicuity: Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
is <hi>Glaucoma,</hi> which is the change of
the colour of the Cryſtalline humour, by
reaſon of its dulneſs and thickneſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
old men do look upon all things as it
were through ſmoak, or a cloud, and ſo do
but darkly diſcern them: Another is <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifiſis,</hi>
which is a change of the figure of
the whole eye, whereby it becomes more
plain and depreſſed, and a drineſs in the
Cryſtalline humour, whereby it is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to reduce the eye to that form, which
may be moſt advantagious to viſion; ſo
that they cannot perceive any thing at an
equal diſtance, but muſt have their objects
more remote from the eye, or the ſpecies
firſt refracted and directed by the uſe of
Spectacles; Another is <hi>Suffuſio ex crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate,</hi>
or any interpoſition of any preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

or dilatation of the apple of the eye; or
whatſoever elſe by obſcuring the glaſs,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:64566:58"/>

ſaid to darken the lookers out of the
windows.</p>

Now to the underſtanding of this verſe,

let in ſome glimmering of light, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

               <div type="section">
                  <head>The doors ſhall be ſhut in the ſtreets, when the

                  <p>For the right underſtanding of theſe
words, we muſt be ſure in the firſt place
to take notice that all theſe words are but
one Sentence, and confequently but one
Clauſe of the deſcription of age; the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
words, <hi>viz. The doors ſhall be ſhut in
the ſtreets,</hi> are not a diſtinct ſymptome of
themſelves, as moſt men have formerly
ſaid, but they have their reference to the
enſuing words, <hi>viz. When the voice of the
grinding is low.</hi> And the doors and ſtreets
here mentioned, are no other, than ſuch
as concern the grinding, and are as inlets
and outlets, waies and paſſages unto that.
And I perſwade my ſelf, that the hitherto
miſcarriage in the Interpretation of theſe
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:64566:59"/>
words hath proceeded from neglect of
this conſideration. The doors ſhall be
ſhut when the grinding is low, and only
then; and the lowneſs of the grinding, is
the cauſe of the ſhutting of the doors. <hi>In
humilitate vocis molentis,</hi> ſaith the Vulgar
Latine. <hi>Ob, per, vel propter depreſsionem
vocis molentis,</hi> ſay others, and that very
conſonant to the Original, inaſmuch as
the grinding ſhall be low, or by reaſon of
the lowneſs of the grinding, the doors
ſhall be ſhut in the ſtreets. Wherefore for
the better clearing of the whole Sentence,
we muſt firſt of all ſhew what is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
by the <hi>grinding,</hi> and afterwards
what the doors and the ſtreets are, and
what the ſound of the grinding, will eaſily
be made appear. The wiſdome of <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi>
is ſo famous throughout all Regions
and Ages, that I need not here Apologize
for it. It would be unbecoming an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Writer, much more the Penman of
this Allegory, to deliver the ſame thing
twice in a breath; And I wonder with
what face any Interpreters could put ſo
great an abſurdity upon the Wiſe man, as
to make this grinding ſignifie no more than
that juſt mentioned before. But for the
clearing of this, we muſt know that grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is of two ſorts, either <hi>Per extra poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,</hi>
                     <pb n="104" facs="tcp:64566:60"/>
or <hi>Per intra ſuſceptionem,</hi> (as Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers
uſe to diſtinguiſh of augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,)
there is an <hi>extrinſecal,</hi> or an <hi>intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecal</hi>
grinding; the former of theſe is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
when two hard bodies acting
againſt each other, do break and bruiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſmall parts, that which is put between
them. And this is the grinding as in a
Mill, of which you heard before. The
latter of theſe is performed, when the
parts of the ſame maſs, by reaſon of the
exaltation of ſome internal principle, or
the addition of ſome <hi>fermentum,</hi> are ſo
acted among themſelves, that the whole
maſs, and every the leaſt part thereof, is
changed and brought into a new Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence.
And this Philoſophy calls <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation,</hi>
and is that of which the Wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
ſpeaks in this place; And it is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
called grinding, becauſe it accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth
the end thereof better than any mill
can do. It will comminuate things of ſo
hard a ſubſtance that no mill can break.
I would fain know what Mill could have
ground <hi>Aarons</hi> golden Calf,<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 20. Deut. 9. 21.</note> but by the
help of fire, and poſſibly ſome ſpecifick
menſtruum, as a proper key for that Solar
Mineral, it was eaſily ground to powder.
Again, it can divide the matter that is to
be ground into ſmaller parts than any mill
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:64566:60"/>
can do; it will not leave the moſt minute
part unſearched, <hi>A little leaven,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 5. 6. Gal. 5 9. Mat. 13. 33.</note> ſaith the
Scripture, <hi>leaveneth the whole lump.</hi> And
our Saviours expreſſion of it, is yet more
ſignificant, <hi>The Kingdom of heaven is like
unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in
three meaſures of meal till the whole was lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened,</hi>
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, till the whole of
maſs, and every one of the leaſt parts
thereof be leavened. No Mill can be ſet
ſo low, as to grind every Corn, and every
part of every Corn; but Leaven leaves
none untouched, but divides (beyond
what Philoſophy gives way for) into parts
indiviſible.</p>
                  <p>Now of this ſort of grinding there is
very much to be found in the body of man:
And indeed all the natural alterations that
tend either to the preſervation of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
or propagation of the kind, are the
products of this inteſtine grinding. And
there is ſcarce a part in man, eſpecially an
internal <hi>viſcus,</hi> that doth not particularly
contribute to ſuch a work as this. And
ſurely, that which lies daily upon our tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers,
had need of many through grindings,
that it may be really tranſubſtantiated into
our fleſh; theſe in the body of man are by
Phyſicians called digeſtions, or concocti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and are to be found almoſt in every
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:64566:61"/>
part, as was ſaid before; but I ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
only in a few, and thoſe well known
to all thoſe that have the leaſt skill in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
things; and theſe few grindings, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with the voice of them, the doors
and ſtreets that lead to, and from them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
well underſtood; thoſe that are more
accurate in the knowledge of all the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
of the nouriſhment of man, may
thence from eaſily attain the whole intent
and purpoſe of the Wiſe man in this part
of the deſcription of age. I ſhall only
mention five: Three in reſpect of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual;
and two in reſpect of the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies;
and they are thoſe common ones;
<hi>Chylification, Sanguification, Aſsimulation,
Lactification,</hi> and <hi>Spermification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe, <hi>viz. Chylification</hi> is
thus performed, after the meat is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
chewed in the mouth, it is committed
to the ſtomack, where continually there
lyeth treaſured up a certain acide juyce, the
relicts of the laſt Concoction; which (as
the Leaven in the bread) doth preſently
infect the whole maſs, and every part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of;
and doth ſo penetrate and ſearch the
parts, and ſo divide and ſeparate them one
from another, and joyn it ſelf to every one
of them, that at laſt the matter of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is ſo perfectly ground, that it is
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:64566:61"/>
brought to a new Conſiſtence and colour,
very like to the Cream of Barly, and is
that Phyſicians call the <hi>Chyle;</hi> and this is
the firſt intrinſecal grinding that the food
receiveth, and is next of all to that of the
mouth, and not altogether unlike to it;
and therefore when maſtication is but
weakly performed, you heard before that it
was helped by infuſion of the food in a
Ventricle prepared for that purpoſe,
whereby the parts were acted among
themſelves, and better comminuated, than
if they had been never ſo long chewed in
the mouth.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond of theſe, <hi>viz. Sanguifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is performed, when the <hi>Chyle</hi> it ſelf is
ground over again, and receiving yet far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
exaltations by a greater ſolution of the
more noble, and active principles; it
once again depoſites its old colour, and
conſiſtence, and ſo at length becomes
perfectly changed into that true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor
of life,<note place="margin">Lev. 17. 11, 14.</note> which is called <hi>bloud;</hi> and
although it muſt alwaies be acknowledged
that the <hi>Chyle</hi> doth receive many alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and exaltations before it come to the
heart; almoſt in every part it paſſeth
through, both in the guts themſelves, in
the Meſentery, the Glandules, and the
milky veſſels, both of one ſort, and of

another; and alſo in the veins; and after
it hath paſſed through the heart, it muſt be
once or twice circulated through the body,
and receive ſeveral defaecations, as in the
Liver, the Spleen, the Kidneys, and the
like; before it be compleatly accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
for its ultimate uſe, all which exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and defaecations, are included in
this Text; yet it muſt ſtill be remembred,
that the principal and ſupream exaltation
of the bloud, the moſt eminent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
grinding towards Sanguification,
in compariſon of which, all the others are
little to be accounted of; is alwaies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
in the <hi>heart,</hi> that fountain of life;
for as ſoon as the <hi>Vena Cava</hi> hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the matter of nouriſhment into the
right Ventricle of the heart, the <hi>fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi>
therein contained working ſuddenly
and throughly upon it, ſets the active
principles at a greater freedom, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
new motion, and efferveſcence into
the bloud, doth happily impraegnate it with
vitality. And not only this new matter
of nutrition, when it firſt attingeth, the
heart is thereby enlivened; but the beſt
bloud it ſelf, after that by various circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and imparting its power and life to
the parts that are nouriſhed by it, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
weak and much depauperated; is
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64566:63"/>
fain to return back again to the heart for a
freſh impraegnation. And ſuch a vaſt dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
there is between the bloud in the
Arteries newly brisked in the fountain, and
that in the Veins lowered and impoveriſhed
with its journey, that the Ancients took
them for two ſeveral things, and knew not
that they were the ſame; like the men of
<hi>Bethlehem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ruth 1. 19, 20, 21.</note> who knew not <hi>Naomi,</hi> nor
would acknowledge her the ſame perſon,
becauſe ſhe went out full, and returned
home again empty; and ſhe her ſelf was
not unwilling to have changed her name:
And he that ſhall call the rich bloud going
out in the Arteries, <hi>Aerial, Jovial, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual;</hi>
and the mean and poor bloud re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning
home in the Veins, <hi>Earthly, Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
Groſs,</hi> ſhall make no Schiſme at all
in the unqueſtionable doctrine of Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The third of theſe, <hi>viz. Aſsimulation,</hi>
is then performed, when the nutritive
juyce is ſufficiently prepared in all things
that are allotted to it, and by the impulſe
of the conveying veſſels is brought near to
the parts that are to be nouriſhed, and then
every one of the parts by a certain alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
property of its own, doth draw that
which is moſt agreeable to it ſelf, and then
falls to acting, ſearching, breaking it over
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:64566:64"/>
again into moſt minute parts, and ſo thoſe
that are like to prove unconformable, are
excommunicated to the pores; and the
other are taken into joynt fellowſhip and
communion, and ſo made one with the
part; and that which is moſt remarkable
is,<note place="margin">Gen. 18. 10.</note> that <hi>according to the time of life,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
augmentation or encreaſe of ſtature is
appointed to man, every one of the parts
takes ſo much to it ſelf, as will anſwer its
dayly growth, and after that is accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,
every part takes only ſo much to it
ſelf, as doth anſwer its dayly decay.<note place="margin">Exod. 16. 17, 18.</note> 
                     <hi>The
Children of Iſrael gathered Manna in the
wilderneſs, ſome more, ſome leſs, yet when
they did mete it in an Omer, he that gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
much, had nothing over; and he that
gathered little, had no lack; they gathered
every man according to his eating:</hi> This is
truly verified in the food of all mankind.
Some there be that make greater prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for the belly, otherſome there be
that make leſſer, yet when this comes to
the meaſure of God, I mean, to be put to
that end which he hath appointed, he that
made the greateſt hath nothing over, and
he that made the leaſt hath no lack, every
one according to his waſting. The Princes
ſuperfluities, and the Beggars penury,
both of them make but equal reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:64566:64"/>
for the dayly Conſumption of their own
fleſh.</p>
                  <p>The fourth that I mentioned, was the
<hi>making of the milk;</hi> which although it be
peculiar to one Sex only, yet I cannot but
take notice of it among the reſt, becauſe a
principal alteration of the nutritive juyce
is thereby made, and the wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs

The Breaſts by their attractive property,
draw from the Arteries that bloud, which
is the leaſt altered from Chyle, as being
moſt agreeable to their glandulous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance;
and from the Nerves, that juyce
which they convey for the nouriſhment of
the ſpermatick parts, and by a ſpecifick
<hi>Fermentum</hi> in themſelves contained, do
ſubact, and comminuate, both theſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors,

                  <p>The laſt of theſe we have named is, the
<hi>production of ſeed,</hi> which becauſe it is
the higheſt, and moſt wonderful of them
all, it had need of greater preparations,

therefore it is, that there are ſeveral veſſels

into that noble <hi>Elixir;</hi> which from
one man hath dilated the world to ſo many
millions as of which it now conſiſts; and
doth continually from generation to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
make abundant reparation for the
cruelties of the King of terrours. For
although in the ſpace of an hundred years
or thereabout, all the living upon the face
of the earth are driven thencefrom by the
ſtroak of death, yet by the vertue of this
divine extract, the earth is at all times ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
peopled, and the Inhabitants
thereof perceive no lack. So that this doth
in a manner perpetuate mortality, and
cauſe men to ſurvive the funerals of all
mankind. Hence it is that the wiſdom of
God in Scripture doth alwaies expreſs Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity,
and the Generations that were yet
to come, by the word <hi>Seed,</hi>

                  <p>And this is the laſt operation in man
which I ſhall mention that is here intended
by the word grinding; and this, <hi>viz.</hi> the
preparation of ſeed (if not all the other)
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:64566:66"/>
is eminently called grinding, in that place
where it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Job 31. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Let my wife alſo grind to
another, and let others how down upon her;</hi>
and all the other alterations of the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
juyce in man (if not this alſo) are
eminently ſo called, in the Story of <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;</hi>
for although it be generally under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
that <hi>Samſon</hi> ground in a Mill, and
our later Commentators, (as if in a Mill
themſelves) following the beaten tract,
do all take it up from others, and leave it
unto others as granted: yet in the Text
there is not once mention made of a Mill,
but there are many Circumſtances that do
to me clearly evince the contrary; the
words run thus,<note place="margin">Judg. 16. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>The Philistines took him,
and put out his eyes, and brought him down
to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of braſs,
and he did grind in the priſon houſe:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it is very obſervable, that it is not ſaid,
they made him grind, or they forced him
to grind, but he did grind in the priſon
houſe: And it is ſo much the more obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable,
becauſe all the injuries done to him
before named, are expreſſed by a force put
upon him; they took him, they put out
his eyes, they brought him down to <hi>Gaza,</hi>
they bound him with fetters, and if this
laſt, had been a like injury and force unto
him, it had been more congruous to have
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:64566:66"/>
continued the ſame manner of expreſſion,
and to have ſaid, <hi>They made him grind;</hi> but
the violence is here left out, and his grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
made his own doing, <hi>He did grind in
the priſon houſe.</hi> Beſide thoſe Manicles put
upon him were exceedingly inconvenient
for a grinder in a Mill? And it is moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable,
that for that ſmall advantage or
pleaſure that ſhould accrue to them by his
grinding in a Mill, that they ſhould at any
time take off his ſetters, ſince they had had
ſo many, and ſo ſad experiences of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel
ſtrength. And if at any time they
ſhould looſe him, then ſure was the leaſt
danger, when the Lords of the Philiſtines,
and three thouſand of the people were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
together to ſee him make ſport;
yet at that time he was kept (by his chains
doubtleſs) at the diſpoſure of a Lad;<note place="margin">Ver. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>For
Samſon ſaid to the Lad that held him by the
hand, ſuffer me that I may feel the pillars
whereon the houſe ſtandeth, that I may lean
upon them.</hi> Moreover, the ancient Rabbies
give us an Interpretation upon this place,
which is not altogether improbable, and
which is confirmed unto us by <hi>Hieron</hi> in
his Commentary upon the ſecond verſe of
the forty ſeventh Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and
that is, that this people being very deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
of Giants, and boaſting much in their

ſtrength (as is well known by ſacred Story)
brought of their choiceſt, and luſtieſt wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
to him in the Priſon, that from this
mighty Deſtroyer of their Country, they
might have a Gigantick Race for its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation:
However in the main, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
my ſelf, his grinding was nothing
elſe, but performing the offices of nature,
his eating, and drinking, and being nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
there; his turning his food into
chyle, his chyle into bloud, his bloud into
fleſh, and other the like natural operations,
which is the true meaning of the word
grinding in this place.</p>
                  <p>We now proceed to <hi>the ſound of the
grinding,</hi> which is nothing elſe but that,
by which the grinding is known, ſome na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
ſymptome ſignificative of digeſtion;
and all thoſe indications that do demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
that the works of nature proceed
aright, and according to their primitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
(whether it be the appetite of the
parts, their action or excretion of their
excrements, thoſe ſubſervient faculties
which uſually are called <hi>Attraction, Reten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Expulſion,</hi> or whatſoever elſe may
manifeſt Concoction) may truly and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
be called the voice of the grinding.
I ſhall inſtance in a few, whereby the reſt
may be eaſily diſcerned, and therein I ſhall
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:64566:67"/>
obſerve my former method having refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
only to thoſe five great works of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
before treated of. The voice of the
firſt grinding, is the natural appetite of the
ſtomack to meat and drink, and is uſually
called hunger and thirſt; the ſtrength and
power of the ſtomack to retain its food;
and the ſeaſonable evacuation of well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted
excrements. The voice of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,
is a free paſſage of the chyle with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
obſtruction, a quick, ſtrong, and a
lively pulſe; a due ſeparation of gall, of
urine, and the reſt of the excrements of
this Concoction. The voice of the third,
is the proper tone of all the parts of the
body, the faſtneſs and fulneſs of the fleſh,
and convenient perſpiration. The voice
of the fourth,<note place="margin">Gen. 31. 3</note> is the Cuſtome of women,
the ſtiffneſs, lively colour, and freſhneſs of
the nipples, the ſmoothneſs, fairneſs, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
and towring of the breaſts, as it is
called in Scripture,<note place="margin">Cant. 8. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Her breaſts are as
towers.</hi> The voice of the laſt, is appetite,
aptneſs, and ability for Copulation; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flation,
and Turgeſcency of the Seminary
veſſels both <hi>preparatory,</hi> and <hi>ejaculatory;</hi>
commonly called, <hi>Fratration;</hi> a right tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament
of the parts appointed for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation,
ſtrength, vigour, and livelineſs
of the whole body beſide: Theſe, and the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:64566:68"/>
like excellencies of nature are the voice of
the ſeveral grindings while they remain in
power; but as age enfeebleth a man the
grindings are weaker, and the ſeveral
voices of them more ſubmiſs; wherefore
it doth neceſſarily follow, that in decrepit
age, all the before mentioned indicatours of
ſtrength and perfect Concoction muſt be
depraved, diminiſhed, or aboliſhed; which
is the lowneſs of the ſound of the grinding,
and doth include the weakneſs of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
faculties in man which ſtand in direct
oppoſition to thoſe excellent voices before
treated of, and ſuch are theſe that follow:

but the <hi>doors</hi> and <hi>ſtreets,</hi> that relate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
are by this time underſtood; but
becauſe the word <hi>doors</hi> hath ſome peculia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
in it, I cannot but take more notice of
it: <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> this word being of the duall
number, ſignifieth properly the two doors,
or both the doors, or the double doors.
And although I know no authority for the
tranſlating of it into Latine, otherwiſe
than <hi>fores,</hi> or <hi>oſtia;</hi> yet I ſubmit it to the
Learned to conſider, whether the word
<hi>Valvae</hi> or <hi>Valvulae</hi> will not as well, if not
better, agree to the Text; the folding
doors, or the doors that clap together, or
that have a double uſe. For the better
underſtanding it, therefore we muſt know
that the doors that relate to the grinding
before ſpoken of, are of two ſorts; either
the <hi>extream doors,</hi> or the <hi>intermediate
doors.</hi> Again, the extream doors alſo, are
of two ſorts; either the <hi>fore doors,</hi> or the
<hi>back doors;</hi> either the doors that firſt let
in the matter of nouriſhment for the body,
that it may therein be ground for its uſe;
or the doors that laſt let out the relicts of
the grindings, or that matter that upon the
ſeveral grindings becomes altogether uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.
The fore doors, or the doors by
which the food is firſt let into the body, are
none other than the Lips, for by the
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:64566:69"/>
ſhutting of them, the meat is kept out,
and by the opening of them, it is let in,
to the firſt grinding in the mouth. And
as they are called doors in reſpect of words,
foraſmuch as they let them out;<note place="margin">Pſal. 41. 3</note> 
                     <hi>Keep the

<hi>Keep the doors of thy mouth from her that

                     <note place="margin">Mic 7. 5.</note> So they may as aptly
be called doors in reſpect of the meat; for
they let that in.</p>
                  <p>And hence it is, that the Orbicular
Muſcles, which make the ſubſtance of the
lips, (being therefore called the <hi>Calves
of the Lips,</hi>)<note place="margin">Hoſ. 14. 2</note> and have the power of the
keys to ſhut and open them, are called <hi>Oris
Pylori,</hi> the explication of which word (as
being very conducible to what we are now
about) you have hereafter. And therefore
thoſe former Interpreters that have applied
theſe words to the Lips, have done ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
well; the report they have given
hath been true; yet I may, with the

although the Ears, the Noſtrils, and the
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:64566:69"/>
Eyes, and all the <hi>Emunctories</hi> of the body
may be here included, yet thoſe which are
principally intended, are thoſe eminent
Poſterns, which ſo long as man lives in
ſtrength are alwaies ready for their work,
which is to give paſs to thoſe three ſeveral
Excrements which we dayly avoid, either
by the guts, the bladder, or the habit of the
body; and therefore theſe doors are,
<hi>Sphincteres ani, &amp; veſicae, &amp; pori Cutis:</hi>
For all theſe have a power of opening and
ſhutting, and conſequently of keeping in,
or letting out, whatſoever comes unto
them, and are often at convenient ſeaſons
retracted for the cleanſing of the body.
Thus far of the extream doors, which are
placed at the extremity of the body, and
ſerve only for inlets or outlets to the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
of the body, for all that which is
either deſired or rejected of nature. The
intermediate doors are ſeated within the
body, and are inlets and outlets only from
one part of the body to another; like the
doors within the houſe, which according to
their ſhutting or opening are ſtops or
paſſages from one Room of the houſe to
another. Theſe may be ſaid to be double
doors, becauſe they relate to two parts,
to that which is before, and to that which
is behind; they let out of that, and into
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:64566:70"/>
this; and of this ſort there are very many
in the body of man, and ſome, I perſwade
my ſelf, that are not yet ſufficiently
diſcovered. The firſt that the matter of
nouriſhment meets with after it is chewed
in the mouth, is the <hi>Pharynx,</hi> or head of
the <hi>oeſophagus,</hi> which while it be kept
cloſe, keeps the meat in the mouth, till it
be there ſufficiently ground, and afterward
by the retraction of the Muſcle of the
throat, which for this very reaſon is called
<hi>Sphincter gulae,</hi> it is committed into the
throat, which is the high way to the
ſtomack; but before it can come there, it
meets again with another door, which is
called, the mouth, or <hi>ſuperior Orifice of the
ſtomack,</hi> which unleſs it be opened alſo it
cannot paſs. And this any man may
perceive in himſelf in a morning, or after
the mouth of the ſtomack hath been long
and cloſe ſhut, if he haſtily ſwallow down
ſolid food before he drink, it makes a ſtop
there, and ſtands knocking as it were,
with pain waiting for admittance. The
third door that the chyle meets withal, is
the paſſage out of the ſtomack into the
guts, and this is the <hi>inferiour Orifice of the
ſtomack;</hi> which is ſo wonderfully framed,
that it gives eaſie admittance for the chyle
from the ſtomack to the guts, but back
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:64566:70"/>
again from them to this, very difficult, or
none at all; and it hath a power of dilating
or contracting it ſelf, making way, or
ſtopping it, according as the neceſſity of
Nature requireth; from whence it is by
Anatomiſts called <hi>Pylorus,</hi> which is a

age which are ſignified unto us by this

What the doors are you have abundantly
heard, the ſhutting or them is nothing elſe
but their ceaſing from their uſe, or their
not being exerciſed to that end unto which
by nature they are appointed; when by
reaſon of the extremity of age the voice of
the grindings is very low, then ſhall the
doors, all the doors, both the doors, the
doors of both kinds, the double doors, ſhall
be ſhut in the ſtreets; they ſhall all have
loſt their opening faculty, ſo that they ſhall
neither let in, nor let paſs, nor let out,
what they ought to do, as they formerly
did, ſo long as the ſtrength of man remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
and the voice of the grinding was
high. <hi>Occluſio labiorum contraum cibum; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeratio

deglutiendi difficultas, impotentia

dyſuria, ſtranguria, iſcuria; alvi adſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctio,

Theſe and the like ſymptomes that ariſe
from the inability of thoſe parts that have
in themſelves a power of opening and ſhut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
for the benefit of the body, are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
indicated unto us. And thus far of the

abſtinence from it, may each of them be
conſidered either <hi>in genere naturali,</hi> or
<hi>in genere praeternaturali;</hi> there is a natural,
there is a diſeaſed or preternatural ſleep.
And between theſe there is a vaſt diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
<hi>Natural ſleep,</hi> is a woing of the
body and mind to quietneſs, whereby the
benign vapours, by their amicable embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
of the brain, get power of it, for its
refreſhment: <hi>Preternatural ſleep,</hi> is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
a rape upon the body and mind,
whereby the offenſive ſuperfluities, by
their violent aſſaults, force the brain to a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:64566:74"/>
benummedneſs for its deſtruction; the
ſame Diametrical difference there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
natural and preternatural wakeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<hi>Natural waking,</hi> is when the brain,
by its own vigour and ſtrength, doth,
<hi>Samſon</hi> like,<note place="margin">Judg. 16. 20.</note> ariſe and ſhake it ſelf; Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
off all thoſe exhalations which, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
ſpent their vertue for the refreſhment
of the body, are become altogether uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs;
ſo that hence-from all the ſpirits of a
man are enlivened, <hi>As a bridegroom com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <hi>and rejoycing as a
ſtrong man to run a race;</hi> but when the race
is run, and the ſpirits are thereby tired,
there is need of a recruit by ſleep. So
then, when there is in the nature of man
a paucity of thoſe pleaſant vapours, and an
ineptitude in the brain to receive thoſe few
that are, there muſt needs follow natural
watching or wakefulneſs. <hi>Preternatural
waking</hi> and watching, on the contrary, are,
when there is an external force put upon
the brain, either to raiſe it from ſleep, or
to keep it ſo. Now, to apply this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction,
we muſt know that ſleep and the
want thereof are directly contrary one to
another, ſuppoſed alwaies they be in the
ſame kind. Preternatural ſleep, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural
watching are altogether incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent,
and therefore an <hi>Apoplex</hi> and a
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:64566:75"/>
                     <hi>Frenzy,</hi> are in no wiſe incident to the ſame
perſon at the ſame time: So alſo natural
ſleep and natural watching are inconſiſtent
one with another, and not competible to
the ſame age; but are to be found in man
at as great a diſtance as his life will give
way for; <hi>Senibus naturale est vigilare,
pueris dormire;</hi> but when they are one of
one kind, and another of another, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
preternatural ſleep, and natural watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
they may both of them without any
incongruity at all, be reckoned up as the
Symptomes of old age.</p>
                  <p>I make the more of this diſtinction,
(though very common and ordinary,)
and ſo I would have others do too, becauſe
of its univerſal uſe upon this occaſion;
for not only here, but in moſt of the other
deſcriptions of age, it hath its place for the
deciſion of Controverſies; in the very
laſt deſcription, <hi>Pigra &amp; tarda alvi depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitio</hi>
was numbred as a ſymptome of age,
becauſe the <hi>Sphincter ani</hi> is hardly and

<hi>alvi humiditates</hi> are reckoned as an atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant

is occaſion. And thoſe Creatures that
have no Lungs have conſequently no voice,

are mute even to a Proverb. And man

                     <hi>For

abounds with, for the confirmation of this
truth I cannot but take ſpecial notice of
that of <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſa. 139. 4.</note> where he ſaith, <hi>There is
not a word in my tongue, but thou knoweſt it
altogether.</hi> As if that member alone kept
the power of words within it ſelf, and
ordered them all according to its own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
and where there is an inability of
ſpeaking, it is aptly ſaid, ſuch perſons are
tongue-tied, and when that faculty is again
reſtored,<note place="margin">Mar. 7. 35</note> it is ſaid, <hi>the tongue is looſed;</hi>
and ſo was it with <hi>Zacharias,</hi> concerning
whom, after he had been dumb for a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Luk. 1. 64</note> 
                     <hi>his mouth was opened imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,

and praiſed God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The third Inſtrument towards the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the voice is <hi>the pallate of the
mouth,</hi> for beſide, that ſome particular Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and words are formed more immediatly
againſt this part, it doth alſo give ſtrength &amp;
clearneſs to the whole voice, and to all the
words that are pronounced in the mouth.
And this it doth the better do, becauſe
the tenuous bone that makes the Pallate,
is an arched roof, covered over with a
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:64566:78"/>
nervous skin, corrugated with ſeveral
aſperities, for the better retaining and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding
the air in the voice. And all
our places dedicated to divine ſervice, are
made of the ſame concamerated form on
the top of them, (queſtionleſs in imitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
hereof,) for the better ſounding and
echoing ſorth both of vocal and inſtrumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
muſick. And beſide the bone which
conſtitutes the Pallate, there is a little
fleſhy part, which is called the <hi>Uvula,</hi> that
doth ſo much contribute to the voice, that
it deſervedly retains the name of <hi>plectrum
vocis.</hi>

mouth is a great inſtrument in ſpeaking, is
ſufficiently proved by the defect thereof,

there preſently ſucceeds a faltring in the
Speech. So that a man may ſay to any

Fourthly, <hi>The teeth,</hi> and eſpecially the
four fore-teeth, are very inſtrumental to
our ſpeech, <hi>Dentition</hi> and <hi>Locution</hi> are for
the moſt part Contemporaries; toothing
and ſpeaking uſually come, and go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the Child cannot ſpeak till he put
forth his teeth, neither can he ſpeak well,
when he ſheds them, nor leave his liſping
till they come again. And the reaſon of
it, is becauſe there are many words that
are pronounced by the dilatation of the tip
of the tongue, and clapping of it againſt
the teeth, which any man may eaſily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
in himſelf, if he will but gently
aſſay to pronounce any word that hath <hi>Th</hi>

that live by ſetting in of Artificial teeth,
do obſerve that they have more come to
them upon the account of their ſpeech,
than for all other ends whatſoever; and
indeed this ingenious help of Art, doth in
no other defect of nature, make ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat

                  <p>The laſt Inſtruments of the voice are
<hi>the Lips;</hi> even as the <hi>Aſpera Arteria</hi> (as

And theſe are the ſecond ſort of Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans
that conduce to vocal Muſick,
namely, thoſe that form the ſound unto a
voice.</p>
                  <p>The third are thoſe that modulate this
voice into muſick; and although it here
muſt alwaies be acknowledged, that every
one of the parts before mentioned, do alſo
contribute ſomething towards modulation;
yet the more proper and peculiar inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
thereof, are the Cartilagineous parts
of the <hi>Aſpera Arteria,</hi> or the windpipe;
and eſpecially thoſe which are termed, <hi>the
Larynx and the glottis.</hi> The <hi>Larynx</hi> is the
head of the windpipe, which although it
be but a very little part, yet doth conſiſt
of more variety of compounding parts,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:64566:80"/>
than any other whatſoever; as little as it is,
it hath thirteen Muſcles belonging unto it,
moſt of which are framed only for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulation
of the voice; ſome ſhut the pipe,
ſome open it, ſome dilate, ſome contract
it, ſo that acting ſeverally, or joyntly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
as there is occaſion; they do won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully
conduce to the variation of the
tone. It hath moreover five Cartilages,
whoſe ſubſtance and conſiſtence is moſt apt
of all other whatſoever, for the dividing
of a ſound; ſome of them are movable,
ſome immovable, ſome of one form, ſome
of another, that they may the better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
the air; and alter and break the voice
into melody. Beſide it hath certain Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules
belong unto it, which by their
viſcous moyſture do ſo irrigate, and as it
were oyle the pipe, that it takes off the
harſhneſs that otherwiſe would be found,
and adds much ſweetneſs and pleaſantneſs
to the Muſick. The <hi>glottis</hi> is reckoned
among the Cartilages before mentioned,
yet becauſe it is the principal inſtrument of
modulation, we cannot but take moſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
notice of it. And it therefore bears
its name, becauſe what eminency the
tongue hath above the reſt in reference to
our ſpeech, the ſame hath this part in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to our ſinging; for the air being
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:64566:80"/>
preſſed forth from the Lungs, this part
riſeth up to meet it, embraceth it, plaies
with it, and by a certain innate property
of its own, without the help of Muſcles,
alters it, divides it, at its own pleaſure,
into all that diverſity of amplifications
and flouriſhes, that the Art of man can
poſſibly reach unto. If a man make a
pipe in the middle of a green reed, and
leave the inward thin film as the tongue of
the pipe, and then breath againſt it; he
ſhall then find, that tongue to receive the
breath, and ſo to modulate it; that it ſhall
be a lively, though but a ſhort reſemblance,
of what we are now ſpeaking of. And
indeed, whatſoever Art can do, muſt give
way to the works of nature: And that
one pipe in man, which hath the wiſdom of
God for its formation to the intent of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
can amplifie and divide a ſound, to
as much variety of muſical accents, as

in the inward Cavity by the innate air;
and then the whole Nerve it ſelf; by the

thus performed. The motion of the air
(as that of the water) is continued by
certain circles and rings, till it be taken by

where it makes the very ſame impreſſion
that it received from the body that made
it; which impreſſion, by reaſon of the

is continued unto the innate air,
which, becauſe in its ſelf moſt quiet and

                  <p>Theſe are the Daughters of Muſick,
which, ſo long as man abides in ſtrength, are

In Age the ſeveral holes and Cavities of
the Ears are ſtopped, the Drum is unbra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced,
the Hammer is weakned, the Anvill

inward Air is mixed and defiled, the Fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

ſo that there cannot but follow
heavineſs of hearing, and at laſt, deafneſs
it ſelf. And this is that imperfection
which <hi>Barzillai</hi> complains of to King

And this certainly is the principal Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome

And therefore the Vulgar Latine tranſlates

               <p>HItherto Age hath been deſcribed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
us, as it hath influence upon all
the functions and Faculties of a man; Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour
and Inferiour; Inward and Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:64566:84"/>
Animal, Vital, and Natural. And
the Preacher hath exactly declared unto us,
how far they are all weakned in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining
ſtate; he now in this Verſe paſſeth
to another head of Symptomes, which is
uſually called, <hi>Qualitates mutatae,</hi> taking
notice of the ſimple affects, and thoſe emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
and moſt remarkable alterations that
attend men in this condition. And here
again he doth moſt elegantly run over all
the parts of man, and give only one moſt
ſignificant alteration in each of them. The
Compounding parts of man (as all men
know, and as we have already heard) are
the Soul and the Body. The principal
affect of the mind in Age, is that of fear,
which is hear expreſſed in reſpect of a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Object, a greater and a leſſer; which
conſequently makes the paſſion leſſer or
greater; according to the encreaſe of Age;
<hi>They ſhall be afraid of that which is high,
and fears ſhall be in the way.</hi> The parts of
the body are either inanimate, or animate;
of the inanimate parts, the Hair receiveth
the greateſt alteration in Age, which is
here ſignified by theſe words: <hi>The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
tree ſhall flouriſh.</hi> The animate parts
of the body, are alſo of two ſorts, either
the hard, and cruſty parts, or the ſoft and
ſpongy parts; and theſe two are uſually
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:64566:85"/>
known by the names of the Spermatical
and Sanguineous parts. The change of
the former of theſe in age, is intimated
unto us, in thoſe words, <hi>The Graſhopper
ſhall be a burden;</hi> the change of the latter
in thoſe, <hi>Deſire ſhall fail;</hi> as it followeth
more clearly hereafter. After this moſt
myſterious and Hieroglyphical deſcription
of the Symptomes of Age, he doth in a
plain and eaſie tranſition paſs from thoſe
general Symptomes that attend a man all
along this ſtate of weakneſs, unto thoſe
particular ones, that do more immediatly
forerun his diſſolution: <hi>For man goeth to
his long home, and the mourners go about the

                  <p>The powers and faculties of the mind,
as they are weakened in age, are abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
deſcribed in the ſecond Verſe: In
theſe words is notified unto us, that moſt
remarkable change that is made upon the
affects and paſſions of the mind in the
ſame condition. And this is only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of fear, and thoſe that are nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
unto it. For as for thoſe which are
placed, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>in appetitu Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcente,</hi>
ſuch as Love, Hatred, Deſire,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64566:85"/>
Joy, and the like; they are in no wiſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
in this weak ſtate of age, foraſmuch
as a firm and a vigorous habit of body,
quick and lively ſenſes, both outward and
inward, do moſt promote them; So that
where there is a general defect in both
theſe, and all deſire doth fail, it is not
to be ſuppoſed, there ſhould be any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominancy
of any of thoſe paſſions, that
proceed from the Concupiſcible appetite;
as for thoſe which are placed, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>,
<hi>in appetitu iraſcente;</hi> They all have for
their object either good or evil; thoſe
which have good for their object, as Hope,
and ſuch like, have little or no place in the
time of age, foraſmuch as it is an evil
time, and there is no pleaſure in it. Now,
all imminent evil is looked upon either as
vincible, or invincible; if a man look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
an approaching evil, as that which he is
able to overcome, it naturally produceth
boldneſs in him, which is the contrary
paſſion to fear, and can in no reſpect agree
to the ſame perſons. It remains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
that that diſtreſs of the mind,
which ariſeth from the apprehenſion of
ſome approaching evil, that is either
deſtructive or burdenſome to our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and not eaſily reſiſtible by our
ſtrength, is the paſſion that is moſt incident
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:64566:86"/>
to Age. True it is, that anger and vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
grief and ſadneſs, and ſuch like, as
have for their object ſome preſent evil, and
border hard upon this we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of; may in ſome meaſure be found in
Age; yet the true and proper, the moſt
notorious trouble of the mind, is that
dumpiſh, melancholy, deſtructive paſſion
of <hi>fear;</hi> which together with all its atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants
and neceſſary conſequences, ſuch as
ſuſpition, jealouſies, ſuperſtition, diſlike,
inconſtancy, betraying the ſuccours of
reaſon, are too familiarly obſerved in the
beſt of men that are crooked with age;
And by how much the more man declines,
by ſo much the more do theſe ſuperfluities
encreaſe, like Miſletoe, and ſome other
Excreſcencies of trees, that flouriſh not,
till the ſtock decay from which they ſpring.
And the reaſon of it is, becauſe the true
Cauſes of this affection (namely, miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions
of the things feared, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability
to reſiſt them) are encreaſed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with age, and therefore muſt needs
produce their anſwerable effects. The firſt
of theſe Cauſes, proceeds from the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Imagination; the other, from
the lowneſs of the ſpirits, and the imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility
of the outward Organs: The firſt,
makes the Cauſe of fear to ſeem the
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:64566:86"/>
greater; the other, to take the deeper
impreſſion. Imagination puts a double
fallacy upon ancient men; firſt, it makes
them undervalue themſelves, and minorate
their own abilities; and then it makes them
overvalue the objects of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ear, and make
them far greater than they are; like ſome
Perſpective glaſſes, that at both ends miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſent
the things ſeen, yet with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
appearance, at one end making them
appear leſſer, and at a farther diſtance;
and at the other end, greater, and nearer
than they ought. And hence it is, that
they are ſo timorous upon every the leaſt
occaſion; that which is ſaid of wicked
men, may alſo be ſaid of old men; <hi>They
are in great fear where no fear is;</hi>

                     </gap>eavineſs of the ſpirits, and
the impotency of the members, renders a
man moſt obnoxious unto fear; the ſpirits
being of a ſtrong, quick, and ſubtile mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tien,
are the principal inſtruments of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and do conſequently bring in the greateſt

aid and aſſiſtance againſt this paſſion; but,
in age they are benummed as it were, and
congealed, ſo that they ceaſe much what
from their operation and motion, and can
adminiſter little, or no courage at all.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it thus onely with the Spirits, but
the Organical parts alſo of the Body, are in
this ſtate made unfit for their Functions,
and altogether unſerviceable to reſiſt the
very appearance of danger; and ſtand (as
I may ſo ſay) ready prepared for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
of fear; The great conſequences
whereof, ſuch as whiteneſs and ſtiffneſs
of the hair, trembling of the joynts and
heart, impotency of ſpeech, failing of the
eyes, and aſtoniſhment, paleneſs of the
face, horrour, gnaſhing of the Teeth, invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
Emiſſion of Excrements, are very
eaſily produced in this condition; nay,
they are moſt of them already there to be

therefore no wonder if thoſe things which

                  <p>Theſe things were known to be true,

<pb n="157" facs="tcp:64566:87"/>
of obtaining both the Birth-right

but I dare ſay, it was from an inward one:
his Age had ſo enfeebled him, that he was

ſuch an one, wherein the Ark of

                  <p>The Objects of old Mens fears are here
preſented unto us under a double notion;
Firſt, thoſe things which are high, <hi>Excelſa

which are lower, more plain and obvious,

but they come on by degrees, and firſt thoſe
things that have more of dread in them,
become the objects of their fear: <hi>High
things; high,</hi> either in reſpect of place, as

Air, as Fiery Meteors, Strange Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
Thunder and Lightning, and ſuch

points in Divinity, about the Eſcence of
God, and the duration of Eternity, about
the Immortality of the Soul, and changes
of the Body, and many other things, which

exact and methodical Treatiſe of the ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes

all the parts of a Man: Now the parts
of the Body (as the word is taken in the

manner that the Wiſe Man is pleaſed here
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:64566:90"/>

their meaning of the things intended,
by ſome other Creatures which do moſt

there is no change that befalleth Man that

White; and therefore <hi>florebit amygdalus,</hi>

to the ſight; the Bloſſomes of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond
Tree are perfectly white, and ſo are
the Hairs of the Old Man, and they are not
onely nakedly of the ſame colour, but both
of them ſo, by way of eminency; not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
white, but the whiteſt of all, none ſo
white as they: <hi>Flores amygdali primi exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtunt
&amp; maximi ſunt albi prae caeteris arbori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus.</hi>
So alſo is it with Man in the time of
Age, he is white, and no Creature, living
to that time, ſo white as he: and hence it
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:64566:90"/>
is that <hi>Logicians</hi> make <hi>Caneſcere</hi> to be <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prium

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> They do very much agree in

are.</p>

Moneths then moſt other Trees, ſo do
theſe haſty buds of Age appear ſometime
twenty or thirty years before ſome others:
Some Mens Hair begins to change when
they are but thirty or forty years of Age,
whereas many other ſymptoms appear not
till they have paſſed ſixty or ſeventy years.
Theſe ſteal upon Men ſuddenly, before
they are aware, to which the Prophet doth

                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> They do agree in their emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency
and remarkableneſs, they are both
of them moſt ſignal things; Men ſtand
ſtill and admire if accidentally they caſt
their eyes upon the Almond Tree that
ſtands all on the Bloſſome; and ſo they do
if they behold a comely and honourable
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:64566:91"/>
Head of Hair, that is as white as that: the
Trees that bloſſome in <hi>March,</hi> or <hi>April,</hi>
are little taken notice of, becauſe then it is
a common thing, neither have they that
ſplendor upon them, that the Almond Tree
hath, that advanceth its moſt comely top
all alone, while all other ſleep in their Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Garments: In like manner the Almond
Head is taken ſpecial notice of among a
thouſand, every one being very deſirous to
behold it, and that with great admiration
and reverence;<hi> The glory of young Men is
their ſtrength, and the beauty and honour of
old Men is the Gray-Head:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Prov. 20. 29.</note> And this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> They are very much alike in
their Indications, they are both of them
moſt certain <hi>Diagnoſticks</hi> of the thing they
appertain to; if there are no other ſings
then they, yet may all Men be very well
aſſured of the truth they beſpeak; If there
be no other Tree in all the Woods, or Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chards,
bloſſomed beſide the Almond, yet
know aſſuredly from thence, the Spring is
come; if there be nothing at all beſides
that ſhews it: if no Flowers appear on the
Earth, if the ſinging of the Birds be not
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:64566:92"/>
come, if the voice of the Turtle be not
heard in the Land,<note place="margin">Cant. 2. 12, 13.</note> if the Fig-Tree doth not
yet put forth her green Figs, not the Vines
with their tender Grape give a good ſmell;
yet if the Almond Tree be bloſſomed,
know of a truth, that the year is turned,
and that the Sun is coming neerer towards
us, and that the Sap ſtirs, though it be not
elſehow perceived: The ſame certainty of
demonſtration alſo doth attend the Hoary
Head; if no other ſymptome appear, yet
if the Hair begin to change white, know
from thence, that the Winter of Age hath
already begun to ſhew it ſelf; the evil
dayes are coming on apace, though the Sun,
or the Light, or the Moon, or the Stars be
not darkned; though the keepers of the
Houſe, the ſtrong Men, the Grinders, and
the lookers out of the Windowes, be not
yet enfeebled; though the Doors be open
in the Street, and the voice of the Grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the Daughters of Muſick be as
high as ever; yet if the Almond Tree
flouriſh, if the Hair of the Head be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to White, it is an undoubted Indication
of the weakneſs attending age: the habit
of the Body is already changed, the innate
heat begins to be ſuffocated, the radical
moiſture is conſuming, the excrements
(which conſtitute the Hair) are inconcoct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:64566:92"/>
and the temperament of Old age
hath already ſeized the Man, although
it be no other wayes to be diſcerned.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, They do alſo exceeding well
agree in their <hi>Prognoſticks;</hi> they are both
of them moſt certain fore-runners and
foretellers of what is to follow after them.
If the Almond Tree be bloſſomed, it is a
moſt certain ſign that Fruit will come af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and that it is not far behind; <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi>
Rod budded (as you heard) and ſoon
after it brought forth Almonds, the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
are in order to the Fruit that muſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>—Cum ſe nux plurima ſylvis</l>

                  <p>And thus Gray Hairs the flowers of old
age, do give a certain Prognoſtick, that
death which is the Fruit thereof, is neer at
hand. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſaith concerning his ſon <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph,</hi>
                     <hi>If miſchief befall him by the way, then
ſhall ye bring down my gray hairs with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
to the grave.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Gen. 42. 38.</note> A <hi>ſad</hi> accident might
have brought them down with ſorrow to
the grave; but they would have come as
<hi>ſurely</hi> without. Theſe are Church-yard
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:64566:93"/>
flowers, which may ſerve to them that
bear them, in ſtead of Paſſing-Bels, to
give them certain notice, whither they are
ſuddenly going. There are ſome Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts
who are yet bolder, and affirm, that
the very thought and imagination of
gray hairs, even in the dreams of them,
though in a Perſon never ſo young, do
portend the ſame thing: When they were
Sacrificing in behalf of one of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours
of <hi>Rome,</hi> the hairs of a Boys Head,
who did Adminiſter to the Prieſts were all
on a ſudden changed to white; which the
Soothſayers and Wiſe Men did preſently
interpret to the Change of the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour,
and that an Old man ſhould ſucceed,
which accordingly fell out; for <hi>Nero,</hi>
who was but one and thirty years old,
was ſoon taken away, and <hi>Galba,</hi> who was
ſeventy three, Reigned in his ſtead:
There is far more certainty in the reality
of the thing. It may thus fall out to young
men, but it muſt thus fall out to old:
<hi>Mors, ſenibus, in foribus eſt; juvenibus,
in infidiis:</hi> Young men are taken away,
but Old men goe away, in their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
courſe; for <hi>Candidi</hi> are <hi>Candidati
mortis, &amp; per eam, immortalitatis.</hi> Thoſe
that are white are marked out in order
unto death, and thereby unto immortali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:64566:93"/>
There might many other Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
be aſſigned, wherein the Almond-Tree
and the Hoary Head do exactly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
but theſe few may ſuffice to ſhew
us, that the change of no other part of
the Body in age, can be hereby figured
out unto us ſo properly as this we have
been ſpeaking of.</p>
                  <p>Beſide <hi>Canities</hi> is a conſtant attendant
on age, and is intimated unto us in no
other part of this allegory: How often in
Scripture are they mentioned both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether?

                  <p>In the interpretation of this ſentence,

ſomewhat both from the common Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and the uſual interpretation of the
place; wherein, if my opinion, together
with its novelty, bring along with it any
thing of ſatisfaction, I preſume it will be
never the worſe accepted: For in theſe
Theoretical notions, the danger is not ſo
great, to deviate from the beaten road, and
to be Heterodox to the general received
opinion. For the ſubject of this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
without all controverſie, it is the
Locuſt or Graſhopper, which differ very
little, either in their nature or form, and
may very well intend the ſame thing: The
predicate is far more difficult, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
hath given occaſion to more variety
of tranſlations; that which is moſt uſual
is, <hi>Erit oneri,</hi> which our Engliſh exactly
follows, <hi>The Graſhopper ſhall be a burden;</hi>
from whence moſt Interpreters do put this
ſenſe upon the place, <hi>viz.</hi> that the Graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper,
or any ſuch ſmall thing, is a great
burden to old men; which although it
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:64566:94"/>
may be a truth, yet it can in no wiſe be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
by theſe words. For then King
<hi>Solomon</hi> would in this clauſe vary much
from the general ſcope of all theſe verſes,
which is (as hath already been ſaid) Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goricall,
and from the particular mode of
expreſſing himſelf in this verſe, which is
Hieroglyphical. Beſide the words in no
propriety of Grammer can poſſibly bear
ſuch a ſenſe as this; and it hath been a
great wonder to me how this Conſtruction
was firſt taken up, and how it hath gained
ſo great credit among men: Nor can I yet
give my ſelf the leaſt ſatisfaction herein,
unleſs it be from the ambiguity of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
Phraſe, <hi>Erit oneri,</hi> which may very
well be taken in a double ſenſe; either
<hi>Erit oneri ſeni, seu alteri;</hi> or <hi>Erit oneri
ſibi.</hi> The firſt of theſe muſt be taken for
the carrying the words to the interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
which hath been before mentioned;
but how incongruous it is to the very
Grammatical reading of the words, any
one who is the leaſt skilled in the Original
can eaſily give an account. For what is
here predicated is directly predicated of the
Graſhopper, and not in relation to any
other perſon, or thing elſe whatſoever.

                     </gap>y parts of the body. The firſt of
theſe, ſeem to be intended in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
words, the laſt of theſe, in theſe that
are before us. This diſtinction is uſually
termed, the diſtinction of the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
in oppoſition to all thoſe manifold
diviſions of the parts of the body, that
are to be found among Phyſicians; And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it hath more of clearneſs and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration

is without its difficulties; It hath put
very learned and ingenious men very hard
to it, to make the beſt of theſe ſtand firm
againſt its oppoſers: but this that we are
now ſpeaking of, is ſo plain and obvious
to the ſenſe, that no man ever yet diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of it, or hath at any time underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
to contradict it. Indeed, that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
of the parts into ſpermatical and
ſanguineous, as uſually it is applied, comes
the neareſt to what is here intended; but
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:64566:97"/>
the terms are not ſo proper; and beſide,
they are built upon a falſe foundation,
which is, that the ſeveral parts of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
have their origination from ſeveral and
diſtinct principles of generation: <hi>viz. ſemen
&amp; ſanguis menstruus;</hi> but the ingenuity of
this later Age, hath juſtly exploded ſuch a
Doctrine as that, and hath brought all
knowing men to confeſs, that all the parts
of the body, both of one kind and of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
have their original equally from one
and the ſame ſeminal matter. And yet
the former diſtinction of the parts, <hi>in
molle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> &amp; duras,</hi> may be found to have a
juſt right, even from their firſt producer.
For the ſeed it ſelf, is not of ſo equal a
ſubſtance and conſiſtence, but that variety
of parts, as to ſoftneſs and hardneſs, may
eaſily be diſcerned in it. And this <hi>Job</hi>
(beyond all humane Writers whatſoever)
doth plainly declare, when he ſaith,<note place="margin">Job 10. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>Thou
haſt poured me out like milk, and crudled
me like Cheeſe.</hi> The very firſt matter of
generation in this reſpect hath a double
ſubſtance; there is a lacteous, and a caſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
part therein; there is a tenderer and a
more fluid part; there is alſo a more Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſed
and Coagulated part; which are
apt to produce afterward parts in the body
of the like diverſification; as the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:64566:97"/>
verſe doth plainly expreſs; <hi>Thou hast
covered me with skin, and with fleſh; thou
haſt fenced me with bones and with ſinews;</hi>
bones and ſinews, they proceed from the
crudled part of the ſeed; fleſh of all ſorts,
both Muſculous, Parenchymous, and
Glandulous, that proceeds from the fluid
or milky part; and skin, that is the <hi>medium
participationis</hi> of them both. <hi>Fleſh and
bones</hi> therefore ſeem to ſtand in the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
oppoſition one unto another in reſpect
of this diſtinction of the parts; And all
the other parts of the body to each other,
as they have relation to one of theſe. Now
which of theſe two the Graſhopper doth
beſt reſemble, is very eaſie for any one to
give an account.</p>
                  <p>The Locuſt and Graſhopper are both of
them hard, cruſty, cragged, crumpling
Creatures, differing from all others prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally
in the protuberance of their limbs,
having their legs ſtrangely crooked, and
their joynts very cloſely inverted, and at
a great diſtance from the trunk of their
body. And this is the moſt remarkable
thing in their frame, and that by which
they are deſcribed in the Book of God;<note place="margin">Lev. 1. 22.</note>
                     <hi>Yet theſe may ye eat of every flying creeping
thing that goeth upon all four, which have
legs above their feet to leap withal upon the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:64566:98"/>
earth;</hi> And afterward they are enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>The Locuſt after his kind, and the
Graſhopper after his kind.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ver. 23.</note> This then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the known form of theſe Creatures,
they do moſt aptly repreſent the hard and
ſolid parts of the body, the bones and
their protuberances, and all thoſe parts
that are produced from the thicker part of
the ſeminary matter. <hi>Oſteologers</hi> have
very well obſerved, that the parts apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
to the bones, which ſtand out at a
diſtance from their bodies, are either the
Adnate, or the Enate parts, either the
<hi>Epiphyſes,</hi> or the <hi>Apophyſes</hi> of the bones.
The firſt of theſe in Age grow harder and
more compact and affixed to the bones
themſelves; the laſt of theſe in Age grow
more apparent, and ſeem to be bigger, and
ſtand at a farther diſtance, than they did
before: And unto this it is that the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi>
Paraphraſe doth directly point; <hi>Infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buntur
tali pedum tuorum.</hi> Now, the <hi>Tali</hi>
are ſometime taken for the <hi>Aſtralagi,</hi> the
bones in the heel, and ſometime for the
<hi>Malleoli;</hi> the <hi>Apophyſes,</hi> of thoſe two
bones which conſtitute the leg, namely,
the <hi>Tibia,</hi> and the <hi>Fibula;</hi> all which, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with them that anſwer them in the
wriſt, and all other bunching parts of the
bones, (which would be needleſs particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:64566:98"/>
to name,) do in age appear far bigger,
and at a greater diſtance from the body of
the bone, than they did before. Yet I
cannot but take more ſpecial notice of one
ſort of bones, whoſe <hi>Apophyſes</hi> are more
eminent, than any others; and may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
be more aptly reſembled by the Graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoppers,
and they are the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the
Spine; every one of which, both in the
neck, in the back, and in the loyns, have
ſeven ſeveral prominencies, four oblique
ones, namely, two aſcending, and two
deſcending: two tranſverſe ones, and
one acute, ſtrait forward towards the
skin. Now, when man by reaſon of age
begins to ſtoop and bend forward, and
withal thoſe fleſhy parts, that cover theſe
proceſſes, begin to ſhrink and decay, (as
ſhall be ſhewed in the following ſymptome)
it muſt neceſſarily follow, that all thoſe
<hi>Apophyſes</hi> muſt appear a great deal plainer
and bigger, than they were before, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
they will ſo exactly reſemble the ſeveral
protuberances of the limbs of the Graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hopper,
that no words can ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
their likeneſs, and none but the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
obſerver of them both, can poſſibly
underſtand. And from this exact likeneſs,
without all doubt, aroſe the Fable of <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thonus,</hi>
that living to extream old age, he
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:64566:99"/>
was at laſt turned into a Graſhopper, and
into it, it may be very well moralized
again; For then the body of man is quite
another thing than what it was in its prime,
it is contracted, and becomes much leſs,
and crumpled up together, and in the
end is brought even to crawle upon the
ground.</p>

is the part upon which the burden is
pitched; and the back bone which is the
part that gives the greateſt ſtrength to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the bearing of it, both which, when
age hath much enfeebled a man, become
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:64566:99"/>

intended, ſo alſo all the other ſolid parts of
the body, that are made of the ſame craſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiment

if we do but here recal the Tranſlation of the
LXX, we ſhall underſtand what change it
is in age, that all theſe undergo; the Cartila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
of the body, the Ligaments, the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes,
the Fibres, the Veins, the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
the Nerves, and Tendons, and the
like, do all grow harder and drier in age,
and tend more towards the nature of
bones. The skin alſo being partly of this
kind (as was before ſaid) is to be numbred
hereunto, which ſo long as man remains
in ſtrength is beautiful, plain, and polite;
but as he declines, grows more cruſtly, and
dry, and callous, and conſequently falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

tranſlated from its firſt ſignification to this
latter, becauſe of the known uſe of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
which is to excite the appetite; <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paris
excitat orexin, &amp; appetitum, cibi, &amp;

ends, eſpecially that of the ſtomack, are
they preſerved in pickle, and ſo often uſed
among us for ſauce. Now, that the word
in this place ought to be taken in this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
that is, in the figurative ſignification,
theſe following reaſons do induce me to
believe, every one of which ſingly, ſeem
to have a good perſwaſive power; but all
of them joyntly, have doubtleſs a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſive
power, to any rational man to be
of the ſame opinion. The firſt, is the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:64566:101"/>
ſcope, that the wiſdom of <hi>Solomon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
propoſeth to it ſelf in this whole deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of age, which is by way of Allegory
all along. No wonder therefore if the
ſame wiſdom, where there be two ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations
of a word, ſhall rather prefer the
Allegorical; the ſecond, is the particular
intent of this verſe, which is to ſhew the
ſenſible alterations that are made in man in
old age, both in reſpect of his mind, and
of the ſeveral parts of the body, and that
ſymbolically, or by way of reſemblance
to other things: and not at all to relate to
any of the faculties; and that which doth
abundantly back this reaſon, is, that the
weakned faculties were deſcribed before,
and particularly it was ſhewn ſufficiently,
how the appetite both <hi>ad cibum</hi> and <hi>Coitum</hi>
was weakned, in the laſt verſe, in thoſe
words, <hi>the voice of the grinding is low:</hi>
And therefore a learned Commentator
upon this place,<note place="margin">Cornel. a Lap.</note> when he had ſaid, <hi>Senum
libido frigeſcit,</hi> further adds, (that which
might better diſtinguiſh it from what went
before,) <hi>&amp; organa coitus diſsipantur;</hi>
which is indeed, the true purport of the
words, though but in part. Again, the
Contextural expreſſions are of the ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſame
nature, both thoſe that follow in the
Allegory, namely, the ſilver Cord, and
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:64566:101"/>
the golden Bowl: and alſo thoſe that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
precede, namely, the Graſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and the Almond tree: And as the
word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> was tranſlated from its
primary ſignification, which is, waking,
(as was ſaid,) to that figurative, of the
Almond tree; ſo alſo would it be moſt
congruous to deal with this word we are
now about. Again, Authority is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
yea, abundant for this way of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating
it: If any one pleaſe to conſult all
the variety of Interpreters, he ſhall find
(that which is a great rarity) the moſt
and the beſt to go together, this way; and
ſince <hi>Hieron</hi> did but give favour hereunto,
I find no Tranſlatour vary hencefrom, but
ſome few into Vulgar Tongues.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, By this way of tranſlating on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
there will be a direct oppoſition, and
a perfect <hi>Antitheſis</hi> (which certainly there
ought to be) betwixt this word and that
which immediatly went before. The
Graſhoppers and Capers are in their form
and faſhion; their ſubſtance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence,
clean contrary one to another;
The one, being protuberous, rough, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,
and hard: The other, round, ſmooth,
ſpongy, and ſoft: And therefore may be
very fit Emblems to repreſent the ſeveral
contradiſtinct parts of the body, under the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:64566:102"/>
ſame variety of conſiſtence. Wherefore,
as the Graſhopper did principally repreſent
the bones, and ſecondarily, all thoſe parts
that proceed from the Craſſiment of the
ſeed; ſo alſo here, the Capers do as aptly
repreſent principally the fleſh, and ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily,
the other moyſt and fluid parts of the
body that proceed from the more tenuous
part of the ſeminary matter: and that
which doth farther confirm this reaſon, is,
from the <hi>Antitheſis</hi> that is alſo in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
of theſe expreſſions: For as there,
the Graſhoppers are ſaid to grow big, or
burdenſome; So here, the Capers are ſaid
to ſhrink or decay; for ſo the word
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſignifieth, and is uſually tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<hi>diſsipabitur, abolebitur, conteret,</hi>
ſhall waſt or conſume, ſhall be ſpent, or
worn out; and is a Metaphor taken from
interbaſtation, patching or piecing, ſewing
or clapping cloſe together, making faſter
or harder thoſe things, that were more
dilated, ſpongy, and flouriſhing before:
So that what we are to underſtand by this
Sentence, the Capers ſhall ſhrink, is the
alteration of all the moyſt and tender parts
of the body, uſually called, the ſanguine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
<hi>Fluidarum,</hi> ſcil. <hi>depravatio &amp; mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio:
&amp; mollium ariditas &amp; conſumptio;</hi>
I cannot exclude hencefrom that change
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:64566:102"/>
that befalleth the bloud and natural hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours
of the body in the time of age: For
they become low and much depauperated,
they are diminiſhed, and far leſs in quantity
than they were before.</p>
                  <q>Minimus gelido jam corpore ſanguis.</q>
                  <p>Nor can I exclude that change that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
to the fat and marrow; man in his
full ſtrength is deſcribed by <hi>Job</hi> to be ſuch
an one,<note place="margin">Job 21. 23, 24.</note> 
                     <hi>Whoſe breaſts are full of milk, and
his bones moyſtned with marrow:</hi> But when
he is very old, there is ſcarce any milk, or
fat, or marrow, or moyſture left in all his
body; a Conſumption is determined
concerning them all. But that alteration
which is principally here intended, is that
which befalleth thoſe parts of the body
that uſually go under the name of fleſh.
Now, the fleſh of the body is of three

lax and tender flakes of fleſh, that lye over,

ſome of them are uſually called Muſcles,

man declines in years, ſo do theſe cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings
wax old and ſhrink, ſo that at length
they become ſhorter and narrower, than
that a man can comelily be wrapped up in

the great alteration and deformity that is
eaſily diſcerned upon the external parts of

and therefore may very well be
tranſlated, <hi>Tempus eujus duratio eſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcondita,</hi>
an hidden duration, a time
that no man knows how long; which
is exactly anſwered by our Engliſh
Law-phraſe, <hi>time out of mind;</hi> and
that both <hi>à parte, poſt;</hi> and <hi>à parte,
ante;</hi> time either that is paſt, or that

which without all queſtion came from

of;<note place="margin">Eccl. 1. 10.</note> as both the ſound and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
will abundantly make appear:
Now this duration at leaſt is in the

how long it will continue: No one
living can give an account how long it ſhall
be before, the earth ſhall diſcloſe her bloud

The ſecond ſignification of the word is
<hi>avum, ſeculum</hi> an age, a certain long ſpace
of time, that is, commenſurate with the
duration of the thing, that is ſpoken of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
A perpetuity (as I may ſo ſay) that is cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed;

Now in this ſenſe alſo may the word be
taken in this place, ſo long as Death lives
(and it is the laſt enemy that ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed)
it will keep in its poſſeſſion, all
that it hath, or ſhall ſurprize: The Graves
muſt be our homes, when once we come

not onely ceaſe from craving, but from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:64566:106"/>
and untill death be wholly ſwallowed
up of victory, all thoſe Bodies that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
their power, muſt there quietly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
as in their own unalterable habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>The laſt ſignification of this word is <hi>du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio
abſolute infinita, aeternitas:</hi> A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
and abſolute perpetuity, eternity.
And in this ſignification it is moſtly uſed,
and muſt alwayes be interpreted when it is
applyed to God, or any of his Attributes,
as often it is. When <hi>Nebuchadnezzars</hi>

to affirm; ſeems on the contrary
to me, moſt earneſtly to deny, and is as
much as to ſay, if a Man die he ſhall never

again: And this</p>
                  <p>Firſt the manner of propoſing the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
ſeems chiefly to intend; for it is not
<hi>negatively</hi> propoſed; <hi>If a man die ſhall he
not live again?</hi> but <hi>affirmatively, ſhall he
live again?</hi> Now Negative Interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
do in all Languages, and in Scripture
phraſe too, more properly intend affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Propoſitions, as where it is ſaid, <hi>Doth

another Interrogation; <hi>How ſhall he

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8. 32.</note> is as
much as to ſay, he ſhall moſt ſurely do it.
On the other hand, affirmative Interroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
do for the moſt part intend negative
Propoſitions: <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaith, <hi>How can I do
this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God?</hi>

the denying of the thing: Both
theſe Interrogations, about the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
too, are together in one Verſe of the
<hi>Pſalms,</hi> ſtill intending their contrary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions;
<hi>What Man is he that liveth, and
ſhall not ſee death?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 89. 48.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhall he deliver his ſoul
from the hand of the grave?</hi> the firſt
part of the Verſe is negatively propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and therefore ſignifies the ſtrong af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming
of the thing, he ſhall ſurely ſee
death: and the latter part of the verſe is
affirmatively propoſed, and therefore ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
the vehement negation of it; he
ſhall in no wiſe deliver his ſoul from the
hand of the Grave: The manner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
of propoſing this queſtion being with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a negative, doth ſeem to carry the ſenſe,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:64566:107"/>
that if a man be dead he ſhall never live
again.</p>
                  <p>Secondly the inference that is hence
made confirms the ſame thing; <hi>All the
dayes of my appointed time will I wait till
my change come;</hi> doth far more naturally
and powerfully proceed from the denying
of life again, then from the aſſerting it: as
to the diligent obſerver will eaſily appear;
if a man ſhall never live again in this world,
it is of moſt high concern to prepare for
that change that foreruns an everlaſting
ſtate. There is no returning more from
death, and therefore let every one wait
upon his buſineſs, and finiſh it, before that
time come: <hi>There is no work, nor deviſe,
nor knowledge, nor wiſdom in the grave,
whither we are going:</hi> And ſince there is
no returning thencefrom, how cogent will
the argument be, for every one to wait all
the dayes of his appointed time, till his
change ſhall come. <hi>If the Tree fall to the
ſouth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9, 10.</note> 
                     <hi>or to the north, in the place where the
Tree falls, there it ſhall be:</hi> And therefore
it is of the greateſt concern to take care
how the Tree fall. If a man at his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
out of this life fall towards happineſs,
or towards miſery, in the ſame condition
he falls, ſhall he remain for ever; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it is a buſineſs of everlaſting concern, to
await our fall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="196" facs="tcp:64566:108"/>
But laſtly, that which makes it yet more
clear, that this interrogation intends the
negative, is the words in the latter end of
this Chapter; where <hi>Job</hi> reſuming the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
and ſummarily declaring what he had
been before ſpeaking of; he ſaith plainly,
<hi>Thou prevaileſt for ever againſt him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job 14. v. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>and he
paſſeth, thou changeſt his countenance, and
ſendeſt him away.</hi> I ſpeak not theſe things
in the leaſt to enervate that moſt comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
Chriſtian Doctrine of the <hi>Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
and as <hi>Job</hi> was very carefull in the
forecited Chapter, to keep his reſerve as
unto that; ſo that in the middeſt of the
Chapter (that therefore it might have an
aſpect over the whole) he interpoſeth a

                     <hi>Man lieth down
and riſeth not, till the Heavens be no more.</hi>
So I would not have any one ſo far miſtake
this Doctrine, as to think the Body of Man
ſhall be kept in everlaſting Chaines of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:
for, though it ſhall never return to
this working ſtate again, yet God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
a ſet time,<note place="margin">Verſ. 13.</note> to remember it in: at
which time it ſhall, by the Word of God,
ſhake off its corruption, diſhonour, and
weakneſs; and by his gift ſhall be cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

ſay, <hi>it is too much;</hi> for if it be ſo, as hath
been related, if Age be ſo miſerable and
comfortleſs a condition as hat been deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed;
happy ſure are they, that are gon, or
going, off from it: If all manner of evills
do attend thoſe that are extreamly aged,
and nothing that good or pleaſurable is;
when they change this State, for that which
is perfectly happy (as we ought to believe
concerning all our Chriſtian Friends de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted)
in ſtead of Mourning, why ſhould
there not be Rejoycing? in ſtead of hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down the Head and Weeping, Why
ſhould there not be lifting up the Head and
Triumphing? at ſo great a bettering their
condition, as ſuch a Change muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
produce: To this I muſt needs anſwer,
That, if we truly underſtood our ſelves,
and were throughly poſſeſſed of what we do
profeſs, in reſpect of the party Deceaſed,
there were no cauſe of Mourning at all,
but rather of Rejoycing; And this not
onely in reſpect of Perſons decrepit with
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:64566:109"/>
Age, but of any other, in whatſoever flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
condition of this Life; for the
change would then be, but from a leſs mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable
eſtate, to that which is moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly
bleſſed: for Man, at his beſt eſtate,
as he is altogether Vanity, ſo is he very

one evil more, and that he ſhall be put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
immediate poſſeſſion of all thoſe good
things, that he either Prayed, or hoped for
in this life, into a perfect ſtate of Bliſs, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite,
at leaſt, for the duration: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
upon this account, there will be very
little cauſe of Lamentation. And, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he is, that Mournes meerly upon
the account of the Party deceaſed, he doth
neceſſarily redargue himſelf of unbelief,
and plainly ſhew, that there is an haeſitation
in his Mind, concerning one of theſe two
things; whether Heaven be ſuch a place as
hath been deſcribed unto us in the Book of
God, or whether his Friend be aſſuredly
gone to that place. So that Funeral Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are, as Divines ſay of Funeral Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
more in reſpect of the Living then
of the Dead. To go unlamented is no
miſery to the Dead; but a ſhame to the
Living. There doth indeed lie a Duty
upon all that are left behind, to bewail
their own loſs of their Godly Friend; Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Affection, and the Fleſhly part of
Man ought ſomething to be indulged in

               <p>THus far the King hath been treating
of all thoſe Symptomes that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
a man all along his decrepit ſtate,
which may appear upon him, while yet he
may have ſome ſpace given him, to remain
in the Land of the living: Theſe that
follow in this verſe are ſuch that immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
forerun his diſſolution; which when
they once appear, there remains nothing,
but a preſent preparation for his Funeral.
And they may ſerve as indications, not
only in this weak and ſpent condition of
age; but in whatſoever other condition of
mans life, by the violence of a diſeaſe,
they are joyntly found; they give a moſt
certain Prognoſtick of approaching death.
In the Explication whereof there is very
much variety of opinions; ſo that it would
be exceeding tedious and troubleſome to
follow them all; but I ſhall ſpare all that
pains, and take notice of none of them,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:64566:111"/>
but what I judge to be neareſt the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention

to find out any thing of truth contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
in them, that alſo will bear its own
evidence along with it, and may ſerve for
eviction of whatſoever is contrary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.
Foraſmuch as <hi>rectum est index, ſui,
&amp; obliqui.</hi> Death, which is the fruit of
old age, and the unavoidable receptacle of
all living: is deſcried to be juſt at the
door, by thoſe Symptomes that belong to
the inſtruments, either of the animal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
or of the vitall; (as for thoſe that
belong unto the Natural, they have very
little or no certainty in this Caſe.) Thoſe
that belong to the animal, have reference
unto the brain, and the parts ariſing from
it; either as they are continued without
the <hi>Cranium, Or ever the ſilver Cord be

Thoſe Symptomes that belong to the vital
faculty, have reference unto the heart, and

either for importation of the bloud

                  <p>The firſt thing that we muſt here make

alſo as in all other parts of the deſcription,
to keep within compaſs of the Allegory;
and find out thoſe parts of a man that are
hereby repreſented. For he it is, that hath
hitherto been deſcribed unto us, as an old
houſe greatly decayed and ruinated, but
yet ſtanding, by all the foregoing Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes;
but now as an houſe falling down
which muſt no longer remain, by this Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome,

                  <p>The Scripture maketh mention of <hi>the

                     <note place="margin">Hoſ. 11. 4.</note> which although they are
there to be taken in a Moral ſenſe, and ſo
excentricall to what we are now about, yet
they are a Metaphor taken from the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
cords of a man, and may give ſome
light thereunto: for as love in all bodies
politick (and conſequently myſtical) doth
both draw and unite; ſo in all bodies na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
the ſelf-ſame offices are performed
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:64566:112"/>
by thoſe parts of which we are about to
ſpeak; for we muſt know, that all the
ſeveral parts of man, are not kept, and
bound faſt together by ſpels, nor are his
ſeveral members moved ſeveral waies, as
it were by Magick Art, the ſoul of man
doth not by a bare <hi>jubeo,</hi> cauſe the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
of outward objects, or the varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the poſition of the ſeveral limbs,
without the help of inſtruments, but by
the apt frame of the whole body, and the
pliableneſs of the ſeveral parts, and the
convenient poſition of all the Cords and
Pulleys towards their appointed ends, we
perceive outward objects, and move our
ſelves at pleaſure ſo; as that an artificial
man, could there be in it, the ſame organs,
and the ſame diſpoſition of them all, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with an active power to put them
in execution, would have a like ſenſe and
motion with our ſelves. The <hi>Chaldee</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raphraſe
doth interpret this Cord to the
<hi>Ligula linguae,</hi> the ſtring of the tongue;
others interpret it to the <hi>Spinalis medulla,</hi>
the marrow of the back; others, to the
Nerves; others, to the outward Tunicle
of the Nerves and marrow, which they
have proper to themſelves, for their own
ſtrength; beſide the other two which they
receive from the brain. All theſe have
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:64566:113"/>
offered exceeding well, and without doubt
have hit the truth, and being put together
may ſeem to make the whole of what is
here intended, which is the whole inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of ſenſe and motion, after it hath
proceeded out of the Scull, and as it is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed
throughout the body; with all
its Coats and Tunicles, with all its diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and ſeparations. I mean, not only the
ſpinal marrow is here to be underſtood, (as
principally it ought to be,) but all the
Nerves ariſing thence from, (both thoſe
ſeven pair, be they more or leſs, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
from it, before it hath attained any of
the ſpines; and thoſe thirty pair, that
proceed from the ſeveral <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of the
neck, the back, the loyns, and the <hi>Os Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum,</hi>)
and alſo the Filaments, and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,
and Tendons, that proceed from all
thoſe Nerves. The Nerves and Fibers
muſt in no wiſe be here left out, foraſmuch
as they do more apparently both unite and
draw, than any other of the parts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.<note place="margin">Job 10. 11.</note>
                     <hi>Job</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou haſt fenced me
with bones and with ſinews.</hi> I compare
theſe fences of a man, to thoſe of an
hedge; where the bones anſwer to the
ſtakes in the hedge, making the ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
trunk of the body, unto which all the
other parts are to be faſtned: and the
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:64566:113"/>
Sinews or Nerves to the binders of the
hedge; which faſten and unite all the other
parts to that trunke; and as for motion or
drawing, it is well known that there is none
in all the body performed, (whether vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
or natural,) but by the influence
of the animal ſpirits upon the Nerves and
Fibers, and their contraction thereupon,
in thoſe ſeveral parts, into which they are
inſerted. Now, although all the ſeveral
and innumerable Filaments are to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
hereunto, yet they are moſt aptly
expreſſed in the ſingular number, by <hi>funi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culus
argenteus,</hi> the ſilver Cord, becauſe
they are but the continuation of the ſame
thing: The Fibers being nothing elſe but
the Nerves divided and diſperſed, and the
Nerves nothing elſe but the marrow in like
manner ſeparated, as ſo many arms and
branches of the ſame tree; they are all
one in their original, the brain; they are
all one in their continuation for a long time,
in the ſpine; they are all one in their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
white; they are all one in their form,
long and round; they are all one in their
Coats having each the ſame three Tunicles,
they are all one in their uſe, to convey the
animal ſpirits, and all this in an apt reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
to a Cord; to which alſo they are
not unlike in their diviſion, for then, they
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:64566:114"/>
are but as ſo many wreaths, or wattles of
the ſame Cord; and that which is moſt
obſervable to our preſent purpoſe, is that
by how much the more diſtant they are
from their original, by ſo much the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
and finer, the harder, and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact
do they grow, like the ſeveral ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler,
and better twiſted ends of the ſame
Cord.</p>
                  <p>It is called the ſilver Cord, firſt from
its colour, for it appears to the eye, of a
white, ſhining, reſplendent, beauty, bright
as ſilver; and thus it is even when it is
taken out of the body, after it is dead;
but how much more admirable and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
muſt it needs be, while it remains in
the body yet living, and actuated with
abundance of moſt refined ſpirits, which
continually aſcend and deſcend thereupon.

                  <p>Laſtly, and chiefly, It is called the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

moſt valued and eſteemed; ſo is, and
ought, this part we are now ſpeaking of,
next unto that moſt abſolute and perfect
part, the brain, which in the very next
following Symptome is aſſimulated unto
Gold. The ingenious Chymiſts take
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:64566:115"/>
pleaſure to liken the ſeveral Metals they
find in the bowels of the earth, to the

whatſoever, (the Sun alone excepted,)
ſo Silver in the earth, above all Terreſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al

                  <p>And this dignity hath the Spinal Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

thereupon. And ſuch an exact likeneſs
there is between the Nerves and Silver,
that they do by a mutual and reciprocal
Metaphor, ſutably expreſs one another, in
the two ſeveral Worlds.</p>
                  <p>For as the Nerves or Sinews are here
ſaid to be the Silver of the Microcoſme, or
little World, ſo is Silver as aptly ſaid to
be the Sinews of the Macrocoſme, or
greater World. There being nothing in
the whole World that is vigorouſly carried
on among Men, but by the help thereof:
Silver is the Sinewes of War and of Peace,
of Merchandize and of Tillage, nay I may

and onely take notice of the ſymptome it

this cauſeth <hi>Paralyſis univerſalis,</hi> which

This is that part which deeply
inſinuates it ſelf into all the anfractuous
paſſages of the brain; and, being firmly
annexed thereunto, keeps every part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
in its proper place, and due texture; ſo
that whatſoever is performed within the
whole compaſs of the brain, whether the
making of the animal ſpirits, their exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
therein, or their diſtribution thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from,
is done principally by the help of this
Membrane: Therefore the Ancients from
that reverence they had for it, have juſtly

And if we do but throughly conſider the

purification and ſpiritualization; or the
manu-miſsion or liberation, be the moſt
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:64566:119"/>
noble work, I think it no hard matter to
determine.</p>
                  <p>It is called the <hi>Golden</hi> Bowl, for the ſelf-ſame
reaſons for which the other was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
the Silver Cord. Firſt, In reſpect of
the Colour, not only becauſe that moſt
precious, and deep coloured liquor of life,
is abundantly contained in the Veſſels of
this Membrane, but chiefly becauſe the
Membrane it ſelf is ſomewhat of a flavous
Colour, and tends more, towards that of
Gold, than any other part whatſoever.
Again, as <hi>there is a place for Gold where
they find it,</hi> ſo there is an hidden, ſecret,
and well defended place, where this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
part hath its natural reſidence; much
induſtry muſt be uſed for the finding out, &amp;
yet much more, for the following of it, and
tracing it, into all thoſe ſecret Caverns,
into which it doth moſt myſteriouſly dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
its branches; but chiefly it is ſo called
from its excellency, and its univerſal uſe.
The inſtrument that doth depurate the
beſt of bloud, and defaecate and exalt the
vital ſpirits, and ſo prepare them for ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality;
can be likened in this lower
world, to nothing, but that moſt abſolute,
and perfect, that beſt concocted and moſt
exalted Mineral of Gold. When the
Lord God had made the whole Creation,
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:64566:120"/>
he in the laſt place makes him, for whom
all the reſt were made, <hi>And he took man
and put him in the Garden of Eden, to dreſs
it, and to keep it:</hi> This place, of all the
earth, was the meeteſt receptacle for ſo
noble an Inhabitant, <hi>for it had in it a River,
which was divided into four heads,</hi>

the whole Land of Havilah, where

reckoned up by their names: when the
Lord God had made this noble Inhabitant
of the duſt of the earth, he in like manner
in the laſt place breathed into him that
more noble part of him, for which all the
reſt were made; And the ſoul of man,
which is to rule and guide him, hath he
placed in this moſt convenient ſeat, which
is watered by a River, that is parted, and
becomes four heads, which are all known
by name, where alſo there is Gold. <hi>Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riarum

are this golden quaternion, whoſe
ſtreams make glad that City, wherein the
breath of God hath its principal abode.
There is yet another thing, wherein this
part we are now treating of, and Gold,
have a very great reſemblance, and that is
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:64566:120"/>
in the ductility of them both: Gold of all
Metals is the moſt ductile, and may be
drawn out at the greateſt length; this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
makes good that Maxime in Philoſophy:
<hi>Quantitativum eſt diviſibile in ſemper di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibilia;</hi>
No man can draw Gold ſo thin,
but a better Artiſt, can yet make it thinner,
it is the nature of this Solar Mineral to be
endleſs in purity; how pure fine the <hi>Pia
mater Cerebri</hi> is, none can expreſs, and
none but the diligent obſerver of it, (who
hath often endeavoured its ſeparation from
the parts to which it is annexed,) can poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
underſtand. This, as ſo much leaf-gold,
drawn out to a very great thinneſs,
doth ſecurely, tenderly, and univerſally
wrap up, all thoſe little hills and valleys,
thoſe convex or concavous parts, that
are within the compaſs of its own Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference.</p>
                  <p>This golden Bowl, ſo long as man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
in his ſtrength, is firmly knit unto
it ſelf in all its parts, but in the extremity
of extream old age, when he is juſt giving
up the Ghoſt, it can no longer continue its
continuity; but by reaſon either of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
drineſs, ſhriveling into it ſelf, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural
moyſture, imbibing excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious
humours, till it is over-full, it often
ſnaps aſunder, and ſo recurs into it ſelf, as
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:64566:121"/>
the word properly ſignifieth; from whence
the brain muſt neceſſarily ſubſide, and all
the parts ſerving in any wiſe to animality,
muſt be ſuddenly and irrecoverably ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
and ceaſe from their ſeveral uſes; and
moreover, immediately hereupon fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth

ſecond verſe, and that as a diſeaſe of old

not immediately kill him, and of which
there might poſſibly be a removal, at leaſt
for a ſeaſon, that there might ſome ſpace
be given him to recover a little ſtrength,
before he go hence and be no more ſeen;
how therefore comes it to paſs, that it is
here accounted as one of the immediate
Harbingers of death?</p>
                  <p>For anſwer hereunto, we muſt know,
that an Apoplex falls under a double con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration;
either as it is a diſeaſe, or as it
is a Symptome. In the firſt conſideration,
it is <hi>Morbus Conformationis reſpectu mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuum;</hi>
when by reaſon of ſome preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
matter, in, or about the Veſſels,
there become an obſtruction, conſtipati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
or compreſſion of them, ſo that either
the vital Spirits cannot be received, or the
animal ſpirits cannot be exerciſed or diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted
as they ought to be. This matter
may ſometime poſſibly be diſcuſſed, or
carried off for a ſeaſon, or change its ſeat,
and ſo the Apoplex degenerate into the
Palſie; however it is not an infallible ſign
of inſtant departure, and under this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
it was handled in the ſecond
verſe. But in the ſecond Conſideration
it is <hi>Symptoma morbi, nempe ſolutae unitatis,</hi>
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:64566:122"/>
when by reaſon of the breaking of the
Golden Bowl, and ſhrinking up into it
ſelf, there immediately follows a Coaleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe
of all the Veſſels thereof, and a Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence
of the brain it ſelf, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
a total abolition of all the actions
of the animal Faculty, from whence there
is not ſo much as the leaſt hopes of reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
and under this Conſideration it is
handled in this place. Or it may be, the
diſtinction of the learned <hi>Nymmanus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nymma.</hi> de Apopl. cap. 21.</note> may
be more ſatisfactory to ſome in anſwer to
this Objection.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Apoplexia est vel vera vel notha. A
true Apoplex</hi> is when the <hi>meatus</hi> and open
paſſages of the brain are ſhut up and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
and ſo the Communication of
the ſpirits is intercepted, the ſubſtance of
the brain, and of all the parts appertaining
thereunto, remaining otherwiſe in good
plight, as they ought to be, in their due
place, with their wonted firmneſs of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition:
And this is like unto an houſe,
whoſe entry or common paſſages are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
filled up with rubbiſh, ſo that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
altogether uſeleſs, and this is the
diſeaſe of old age before-mentioned. But
<hi>a bastard Apoplex</hi> is a far more dreadful
thing, when the tone of the brain, and of
all the parts within the compaſs of the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:64566:122"/>
                     <hi>Pia mater,</hi> is wholly relaxed and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and by conſequence only thereupon,
all animal functions do in a moment ceaſe,
in the manner of the true Apoplex, but
yet with far more terrible and amazing
Symptomes, the pulſe and reſpiration alſo
being wholly taken away, and the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
changed to that gaſtly aſpect before
mentioned; which is an infallible ſign of the
duſt immediately returning to the earth as
it was, without any the leaſt ſtop in its
courſe; <gap reason="foreign">

thoſe parts are, that do principally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
to the production and preſervation of

theſe Symptomes. For as the

as the frame, action, and uſe of the
heart, together with the true motion of

the words of this Allegory that contain the
ſum of that Doctrine, have all this while
been an undiſcoverable myſtery, <hi>as a book
ſealed up, that none could read or underſtand.</hi>
And as all thoſe who have endeavoured to
reveal the Revelations, that muſt remain
unrevealed till the appointed time of their

declared their own weakneſs and inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
for ſuch a work; And deſcribing at

Circulation was received among Men, and
gave light to the World; have, with their

own inability, and have left theſe two Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigmatical
ſymptomes far more intricate
then they found them; And of all thoſe
ancient Commentators and Criticks that I
have ſeen upon the place (which has not

                  <p>Now, in order to the end propoſed, we
muſt know in the firſt place, that which the
Scripture doth far above all other Writings
moſt clearly declare, and that is, that the
Life of a Man conſiſts in his Blood. For

a gift of the whole. The ſoveraignty and

having been underſtood by Interpreters,
makes them come farr ſhort alſo in the
Myſtery; which is that the Doctrine of
the Kingdom of Chriſt (for that is the
good thing that his heart is here inditing)
having not as yet had its full meaſure of
ſtrength and life in the World, and that
which it formerly had, by reaſon of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution
of time, and circulation of Ages,
being much weakned and enfeebled, is now
again in <hi>Davids</hi> heart by the Spirit of the
living God, impraegnated with new vigour,
and thencefrom with great earneſtneſs pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
forth to the Generations to come, even
to the end, to ſuſtain and ſupport them,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:64566:125"/>
and to quicken them all to their duty, and
to a longing expectation of the Glorious
Kingdom of their Lord. But to return to
the Heart with the Blood: We muſt far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
know for the explication of theſe ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes,
that there are within the body of
the heart, two firmly diſtinct cavities, a
right and a left, uſually called <hi>Ventricles:</hi>
from which there ariſe, and unto which
there are annexed certain peculiar veſſels
conducing to the ends hereafter ſpecified.
Out of the right ventricle of the heart,
proceed the great vein called <hi>Vena Cava,</hi>
which ſends forth branches throughout the
whole body, and hath at its entrance into
the heart, certain portals, from their form
called <hi>valvulae tricuſpides;</hi> And alſo that
Artery, anciently called <hi>vena arterioſa;</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
into the lungs, unto whoſe original
are annexed, the portals reſembling the
Greek <hi>Sigma,</hi> and are therefore called <hi>val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulae
ſigmoideae,</hi> Out of the leſt Ventri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
proceed that vein anciently called <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria
venoſa;</hi> inſerted in like manner into
the lungs; and alſo the great Artery, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>Arteria aorta,</hi> which diſpenſeth its
branches throughout the whole Body, both
whoſe Cavities are defended with the like
portals with the former. It remains onely
that we ſhew how the blood and life is
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:64566:126"/>
actuated in theſe parts, and howit paſſeth in,
and through them, and in and through the
whole habit of the Body; which is by way
of Rotation, or running the round, going
out from the fountain, and returning thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
again.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 1. Verſ. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>The Sun ariſeth, and the Sun

aroſe; The Wind goeth toward the South,

                     <hi>it whirleth

again according to its Circuits;</hi>

                     <hi>All the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
run into the Sea, yet the Sea is not full;
unto the place from whence the Rivers come,
thither they return again.</hi> Thus it pleaſeth
the King to expreſs the Circulations of the
greater World; thoſe of the leſſer are no
leſs remarkable. The Blood wherein is
the Life of Man paſſeth about the Body
continually, and returns according to its
circuits; the ſtreames thereof run into the
fountain, which is never full, unto the place
from whence they come, thither they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
again; which is by the Inſtruments
before mentioned thus performed. The
<hi>Vena Cava</hi> containing much blood in its
cavity, neer the <hi>baſis</hi> of the Heart, on the
right ſide, doth gently paſs it into the right
Ventricle of the Heart, which is dilated in
its <hi>Diaſtole</hi> for its reception, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
thereupon contracting its ſelf in its
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:64566:126"/>
                     <hi>Syſtole</hi> (the three pointed Portals hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the paſſage back again into the <hi>Cava</hi>) it
muſt neceſſarily thruſt the blood through
the open paſſage of the <hi>Vena Arterioſa</hi>
(where the ſigmoidal Portals hindering its
return) it muſt paſs through the Streiner of
the Lungs, and ſo be received into the
branches of the <hi>Arteria Venoſa,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
brought into the left Ventricle of the
Heart, where again it is with violence pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
forth into the <hi>Aorta</hi> (the Portals here
as before alwayes hindering its regreſs) by
the branches of which Artery it is carried
to all the parts of the Body to enliven them,
which work being done, what remaines is
received into the Capillaries of the Veines
in the ſeveral parts, whence it paſſeth of its
own accord naturally towards its Center,
from the leſſer into the greater branches of
the veines, and conſequently at laſt into the
great Trunk of the <hi>Cava,</hi> from whence it
is recommitted into the right ventricle of
the Heart, to be chaſed the Foyl. This is the
true Doctrine of the excellency and motion
of the blood, and of the uſe of the Heart, and
the parts appertaining thereunto; all which
were perfectly known to <hi>Solomon,</hi> as will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly
appear anon, in the explication of
the ſymptomes we are now about. Yet
it pleaſed the Lord that this knowledge
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:64566:127"/>
ſhould with the poſſeſſor of it, ſink into
duſt and darkneſs; where it lay buried for
the ſpace of 2500 years at the leaſt, till it
was retreived thence from by the wiſdome
and induſtry of that incomparable, and for
ever to be renouned Dr. <hi>William Harvey,</hi>
the greateſt honour of our Nation, and of
all Societies of which he was a Member,
who ſtands, and ever will do, with the
higheſt note of Honour in the Calenders
both of Phyſicians and Philoſophers, and
it were but juſtice to put him with the ſame
eminence into that of the Church, ſince he
hath Contributed more to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of this, and many other places of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture,
then all that ever undertook that
Charge.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things being throughly weighed,
and well underſtood, the two ſymptomes
which remain to be ſpoken to, do open
themſelves into the ſame Doctrine without
any more ado. By the Pitcher therefore we
muſt underſtand the true and proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptacle
of the Blood, namely the <hi>Veines,</hi>
which throughout the whole body ſerve on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as a veſſel, to contain that noble Liquor,
and carry it back again to the Fountain.
The Original word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſignifieth ſometime
more generally any containing veſſel,<note place="margin">1 King 17. 14.</note> and
ſo is taken for the Widows Barrel in which
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:64566:127"/>
was the meal,<note place="margin">Gen. 24. 6. Judg. 7. 1.</note> but more eſpecially that
which is called a pitcher, and ſo more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
it is uſed. This word both the
Greeks and the Latines take unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
only varying the Termination as is
moſt proper to each Language, and that in
the very ſame ſignification. Now the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
containing Veſſel for the bloud is the
Veins, there the bloud is, as I may ſay, at
home, in its own place; while it is in the
heart, it is preparing, enlivening, and eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling;
while it is in the Lungs, and all the
other Parenchymous parts of the bowels,
it is depurating and cleanſing; while it is in
the Arteries, it is by force journeying;
while it is in the Poroſities of the fleſhy
parts, it is communicating of life, and
nouriſhing; but while it is in the Veins, it
hath no force upon it at all, nor is it doing
any thing of general uſe to the Body, only
conſulting its own good, and tending in its
own natural courſe to its proper Center;
as milk is in the breaſts, and marrow in the
bones, ſo is bloud in the veins, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
theſe are the Pitcher here intended.
This Pitcher alſo hath its Ear, which is
uſually called, <hi>Auricula Cordis;</hi> which
(notwithſtanding its name, as if it moſt
properly appertained to the heart) yet we
muſt know doth rather belong to the vein,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:64566:128"/>
and is indeed a part thereof, and not only
a part, but the principal and primary part
thereof, from whence all other parts and
branches do ariſe, as from their original,
and whereunto all the bloud of the body
by the Compreſſive motion of the Veins,
doth naturally tend, as to its ultimate
hold; and whence-from it will in no wiſe
depart but by force; and therefore this
head-ſpring of the veins being dilated by
the continual afflux of bloud, is neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to eaſe it ſelf by Contraction, and ſo
conveniently forceth out a due proportion
of bloud into the Fountain, whereunto it
is annexed.</p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Fountain</hi> can be no other than
the right Ventricle of the heart, for this is
yet more ſtrictly the fountain of life, and
forge of the vital ſpirits, and it doth ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
live before, and dye after, the other
parts, even of the heart it ſelf; Moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
here it is, that the matter of our nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment
receiveth its firſt enlivening, for
our food being received from the ſtomack
and guts into the common paſſage of
Chyle, is thence-from carried directly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the ſubclavial branch of the <hi>Vena Cava,</hi>
where being mixed with bloud, it yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
lifeleſs and heartleſs, till being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
along that vein, it is at laſt brought
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:64566:128"/>
into the right Ventricle of the heart;
wherein the heat, motion, and ferment, ſet
the active principles thereof at a perfect
freedom, and ſo inſtantly endow it with
plenty both of life and ſpirit. Thus richly
fraught, doth the bloud paſs out of its
fountain, and, by the waies before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
it is brought to all the parts of the
body, where parting with much of its la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
for their ſuſtentation, and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frigerated
by the coldneſs of the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
and the ambient air; it would ſoon
be coagulated, and altogether barren, did
it not return again to the right Ventricle
of the heart, as unto its own fountain, to
recover its former perfection. This part
therefore, that doth at the firſt give life to
that which enliveneth the whole man, and
doth, as often as it returns thither, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praegnate
it anew with the ſame, muſt
needs be the fountain here intended. And
to this the Original word gives an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
clearneſs; implying, not only
the <hi>Signum,</hi> but the <hi>Signatum;</hi> not the
Hieroglyphick only, but the part thereby
deciphered: ſignifying in the firſt place,
<hi>Fons,</hi> a Fountain; and ſecondarily, <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turigo
Venarum,</hi> the ſpring or original from
whence the Veins ariſe; and this is ſo
clear, that made ancient Commentators
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:64566:129"/>
interpret the Fountain here unto the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver:
Now, had they been right in their
natural knowledge; that is, had they
known that the Veins do not ariſe from
the Liver, as from their firſt original, but
from the right Ventricle of the heart, (as
all knowing men now confeſs they do,)
they had without all doubt, by the
guidance of this moſt ſignificant word,
pitched upon the true meaning of the
place.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Veſſels being throughly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
we muſt farther know, that ſo long
as man remains in perfect health and
ſtrength, they are uncellantly and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
performing all thoſe offices unto
which they are appointed; but this natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Courſe doth not continue for ever, for
this Pitcher is but an earthen Veſſel, and
doth not ſo often go to the Fountain, but
at laſt it comes broken home. This break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Pitcher here (which is the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome
of old age juſt upon the point of
death) is the failing of the Veins, their
ceaſing from their natural action and uſe,
when they can no longer carry back, nor
conveniently paſs into the heart that liquor,
which they properly contain. That little
bloud that remains in the cold body of man
near his end is ſoon Coagulated, and
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:64566:129"/>
ſtagnating in the Veins, the motion and
circulation thereof is hindered, and ſo it
becomes thick, like unto the pith of Elder;
And becauſe it cannot return to the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,
for a redintegration of its life and
ſpirit; it dyeth in the veins, and ſo all the
extream parts of the body become ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
and cold; which is the Symptome
here intended. <hi>Frigiditas extremorum</hi> is
acknowledged by all that have conſidered
that ſubject, as one of the moſt certain
ſigns of approaching death. And our great
Maſter of Prognoſticks, in that compleat
and yet compendious book of his Apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſms,
doth once and again, not out of
forgetfulneſs, but out of earneſtneſs, that
it may more eſpecially be taken notice
of; give us that famous Maxime,

to thoſe, which ſerve for exportation
and rejection of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The bloud (as was before obſerved)
naturally, of its own accord, tends in the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:64566:130"/>
veins, unto the heart; but it returns not
from the heart, into the parts of the body,
but by force: Thus all the Rivers in the
Land naturally ebb into the Sea, but they
flow not thence-from, any farther, than
the violence and impulſe of the Sea ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends.
The bloud, being once forced
from the heart, is preſently received into

to all the parts of the body. This
therefore being the chief and principal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of Rotation, or Circulation of
the bloud, is moſt aptly intimated unto us
by a Wheel. For what is a Wheel, but
an inſtrument of Circulation? And what
can a Wheel be an Hieroglyphick of, but
of ſomething that goes, or makes the
round? And this is ſo obvious to every
one, that all that have ever Commented

at ſome ſuch thing. Some therefore have
interpreted this place to the life of man,

And ſo they make this expreſſion explained
at large in the following verſe; <hi>The duſt
ſhall return to the earth as it was, and the
ſpirit ſhall return to God that gave it.</hi> Others
interpret it to the reciprocal Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
between the heart and the head;
the heart continually ſending to the head,
bloud and vital ſpirits; and the head again
returning them to the heart, ſublimed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
of animality.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, There are that ingeniouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret
it to Reſpiration, which is perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a circular motion, Inſpiration, and
Expiration continually ſucceeding one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
in their Courſes. All theſe Archers
have ſhot exceeding well, and have hit the
<hi>But,</hi> (while many others have ſhot at Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,)
yet theſe not being able to diſcern
the <hi>White,</hi> have not touched that principal
Mark. I mean, the grand Circulation in
mans body, not being known to theſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Commentators, they have done the
beſt that could be in the ſecond place.
What this grand Circulation is, and how
performed, hath been already deſcribed;
and thoſe veſſels that are inward bound,
which bring home the noble Travellour,
the encompaſſour of the little World,
were deſcribed in the Explanation of the
foregoing Symbole; but thoſe which are
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:64566:131"/>
outward bound, which carry him forth
with all his wealth and ſubſtance to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
his intended end, are here intimated
unto us by the Wheel. That the great
Artery, with all its branches throughout
the whole body, is here principally pointed
at, hath been already ſaid; and may be
farther confirmed; firſt, in that it an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers
ſo directly to the vein ſignified in the
laſt Symptome, by the Pitcher. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
In that it is to us the moſt apparent
Pulſor; we can feel the bloud to be forced
along its Cavity, in the Wriſts, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
and divers other parts of the body.
Laſtly, in that it is ſo appoſitely placed at
the Cock of the Ciſtern, as you ſhall hear
hereafter. Yet we muſt not ſo limit this
Wheel to the Arteries, as to exclude the
very ſubſtance and Parenchymous part of
the heart it ſelf: For upon whatſoever In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
the pulſifick faculty is exerciſing
it ſelf, they are all here intended, by the
Wheel; for they are they, and they only,
that carry off the bloud from the fountain,
and force it from the Center of the body,
to the Circumference. Water may eaſily
be conveyed in Trunks or Pipes, by its
own natural tendency only, unto all thoſe
places that are beneath or level with the
Spring from whence it firſt comes; but if
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:64566:131"/>
you would have it of a farther uſe, to ſerve
thoſe places that are higher than the ſpring,
you muſt then fetch it up with violence,
by a Wheel, or ſome ſuch Inſtrument of
force, as is to be ſeen in our Water<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes,
and all ſuch ingenious Inventions
of publick good. Thus all the bloud in
mans body is, in certain Pipes and Trunks,
by its own natural tendency only, brought
home to the heart; but it will in no wiſe
go farther, to be of a more general uſe to
the whole body, till it have ſome Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of force to compel it thence-from;
The Pulſifick faculty is the mover, and
the Inſtruments of Pulſation the Wheel,
that performs this work, that is of ſo pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
a concern to the whole.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Cistern</hi> from whence this Wheel
forceth that liquor which afterwards it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyeth
throughout all the parts, is the left
Ventricle of the heart, for hereunto it is,
that the great Artery is annexed, and from
hence it doth ariſe. A Ciſtern is a Veſſel
made on purpoſe to receive a due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of water, and to contain it till
the time of uſe, and then conveniently
to paſs it into thoſe other veſſels, that are
appointed to receive it thence-from. And
thus the left Ventricle of the heart doth in
its <hi>Diaſtole,</hi> receive that bloud that is
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:64566:132"/>
brought unto it by the <hi>Arteria Venoſa</hi> of
the Lungs, and having retained it a little,
it doth in its <hi>Systole,</hi> conveniently paſs a
due proportion thereof into the <hi>Aorta,</hi>
to be diſpenſed as was ſpoken before;
And this is the true and only uſe of the
left Ventricle. For the bloud being eno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
and enlivened in the right Ventricle,
and refrigerated, and cleanſed from its fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liginous
vapours in the Lungs, it is now in
all things accompliſhed for its ultimate uſe,
and remains only to be ſent, into thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts it is to quicken, which it
cannot conveniently be, unleſs it be firſt
received into this Ciſtern, and afterwards
by the Pulſifick Faculty and Inſtruments,
be diſpoſed of, to that appointed end; and
we cannot but here remind, thoſe portals
that are placed, both at the entrance into,
and paſſage from, the veſſel we are now
ſpeaking of, namely, the <hi>Valvulae tricuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pides
&amp; ſigmoideae,</hi> which as the Cocks to
let in, and let out, do by their opening or
ſhutting give convenient paſſage, or abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
ſtoppage to that liquor which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
runs that way.</p>
                  <p>It cannot but by this time be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
by all thoſe that have gone along
with us, and taken ſpecial notice of the
aptneſs of theſe two expreſſions, <hi>viz. The
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:64566:132"/>
Pitcher at the Fountain, and the Wheel at
the Ciſtern,</hi> to ſymbolize unto us the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of the bloud, and the uſe and acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the heart, and the parts belonging
thereunto; that the Doctrine which is
now juſtly called <hi>Harvaean,</hi> was at firſt <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomonian.</hi>
For as it pleaſed God in theſe
latter daies to give in this certain and moſt
uſeful knowledge, to the induſtrious and
indefatigable endeavours of the Learned
Dr. <hi>Harvey;</hi> ſo did he of old, give in the
ſame, unto King <hi>Solomon</hi> in the lump, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
with all other natural knowledge,
as a ſuperabundant anſwer to his fervent
and effectual Prayer; which great truth
being confirmed by the powerful reaſons
and ocular demonſtrations of the one, and
by this divine teſtimony of the other, let
it not be for the future in the leaſt meaſure
doubted or queſtioned; but let it be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
prized, and ſo much the rather, becauſe
(while many others of great importance,
wherein theſe two Worthies doubtleſs
agreed, have periſhed by the way,) this
only from them both, hath eſcaped ſafe to
our hands.</p>
                  <p>It remains now, that I only name unto
you that Symptome of Old Age, at the
time of death; that is here ſignified unto
us, by the Wheel broken at the Ciſtern;
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:64566:133"/>
which cannot but be underſtood, to be the
ceaſing of the Pulſe; the Inſtruments of
Pulſation decay, and can no longer perform
that work, which muſt neceſſarily be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
for the preſervation of life;<note place="margin">Exod. 14. 24, 25.</note> 
                     <hi>It came
to paſs when the Lord had a purpoſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to deſtroy the Hoſt of the Aegyptians,
that he looked upon them, and troubled them,
and took off their Charet wheels, that they
drave heavily.</hi> Whenſoever it is the
good pleaſure of God to give that word of
Command, that the Tabernacle of our
bodies, ſhould be as they were; his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
is eaſily diſcerned before-hand by his
looking upon us, and troubling us, and
giving diſturbance unto, and taking off,
thoſe Charet wheels, upon which our life
is turned; but yet this is far more apparent
in the time of Age, for then the Charet
wheels are more ſenſibly hindered and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
and ſo taken off by degrees. The
old mans Pulſe doth yearly and dayly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline,
both in reſpect of the mover, the
ſtroke and the intervall; ſo that it muſt
needs beat more languidly, ſlower, and
ſeldomer than it did before. The Faculty
grows weaker, the uſe is not ſo urgent,
nor the Inſtruments ſo vigorous, in age,
wherefore all the Cauſes of a quick and a
lively Pulſe failing, the ſad effect thereof
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:64566:133"/>
muſt undoubtedly follow; nor will it ever
ceaſe declining, till it ceaſeth beating, and
then the man immediately ceaſeth living;
<hi>Pulſus, rarus, tardus, languidus &amp; non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunquam
intermittens,</hi> is the true pulſe of
the old man, all the while he is in that
condition, and is like unto the toling of a
paſſing-bell, which may put him and all
his friends in mind, that he is ſhortly going
the way of all fleſh, but <hi>Pulſus omnino abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litus
ſive aſphyxia,</hi> (which is the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome
here mentioned,) is the condition
of the dying man, and is like the ſtinting
of the Paſſing-bell, or rather the ringing
out of the Knell, which gives notice unto
all that he is gone, and may ſerve as a
loud, and diſtinct invitation to the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
                  <p>And thus I have as plainly, and as briefly
as I could, run over all theſe myſtical Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptomes;
both thoſe that attend a man all
the time of his declining age, and thoſe
that more immediately forerun, and foretell
his laſt change. And now I judge it time
for me to deſiſt, when all ſenſe and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
both in the Rivulets and Fountain is
quite taken away, when there is death in the
face, when there is a coldneſs in the extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
and an utter abolition of the Pulſe,
there is no more room for the Phyſician, or
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:64566:134"/>
ſpace given him to intermeddle any longer:
Thus far I hope I have kept within my
bounds, and given no offence to thoſe jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Overſeers, to whom only the interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Scripture is deemed to belong;
this Subject hath been purely Phyſical,
wherefore in the proſecution of it, I have
not exceeded my own Laſt, nor made a

ſaid, may ſerve only to tell Men, that there
is a Treaſure hid in this Field, and withall
to ſhew of what nature, and what value it
is, and which way the veines of it do ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
paſs under ground, I ſhall have my full
end thereby. For howſoever I may, in my
own ſearch, in digging and delving after it,
mix earth, and dirt, and rubbiſh, with Silver,
and Gold, and precious Stones; yet it will,
without all doubt, give occaſion to all
thoſe, who love and long after the Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
of ſuch Treaſures as theſe, to come
to the place where they are to be had. The
Word of God doth upon many Subjects of
Natural things, though but briefly and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidently
mentioned, give a clearer and more
ſure light, then all the voluminous Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
of the whole ſhoale of Heatheniſh

This great Truth, I know, many Learned
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:64566:137"/>

Holy Writings of God, yet they are every

the Garden.</hi> I muſt confeſs with others that
there are many Natural things herein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,
that are inconſiſtant and contrary
to what we have learned in the Schooles,
but that matters not; let us be ſure to
make God wiſe, and him true; though
every Man a fool, and a liar. There are
alſo ſome things which will ſtartle and
amaze the beſt humane reaſon, nay, that
which is much farther, ſome things that our
ſenſes will hardly give conſent unto; yet
in all theſe difficult caſes, I have had a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
ſolution (which although it will not
untie all thoſe intricate knots I meet with,
yet it will looſe them, which is full as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory)
and that is, that grace and gift of
God which is <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I have I hope by this time done a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
good work, on the one hand I have vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated
our profeſſion, from all thoſe abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
and filthy ſcandals, that impudent
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:64566:138"/>
and malevolent Perſons have been apt to
caſt upon it; as though the ſtudies we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted
our ſelves unto, did (like the Sin of
<hi>Adam</hi>) naturally make us run from God,
and hide our ſelves from him, and patch up
ſome periſhing remnants to cover our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs,
after our own contrivances:
whereas in truth, there is nothing in all the
World, that Man can be buſied about, that
will ſooner bring him to God, then the
earneſt beholding him in the Book of the
Creatures; there is not the moſt contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptible
being, which by virtue of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Fiat,</hi> at firſt ſtarted out of nothing, that
will not (if it be throughly ſearched and
followed) at length bring us home to its
eternal Father; <hi>As of him, and from him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 11. 36.</note>
                  <hi>and through him;</hi> ſo <hi>to him alſo are all
things, to whom be glory for ever.</hi> But how
much more ſhall we be inſtructed in this
Divine Leſſon, by intimately contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
that Heavenly Work of Works, the
ſumm and height of the viſible Creation,
that honourable piece, <hi>tantum non</hi> Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call,
in which the Creatour himſelf, reſted
in time, delighted from Eternity, being the
true pattern of his own Divine Image;
<hi>Man.</hi> And God in his Providence having
ſo ordered, that the Holy Writings ſhould
begin, with the Hiſtory of the Creation of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:64566:139"/>
all things, and laſtly and chiefly of Man;
doth plainly teach us this leſſon, that none
are ſo Idoneous hearers, or ſo meet recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
of the words of his mouth, as thoſe
that have firſt well underſtood and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
admired the Works of his hand. All
which fall under our conſideration, as the
proper ſubject of our knowledg, but chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the chiefeſt, which cannot but in the end
bring us to him, who made and knowes all
things, as the ſaying of the Woman did the
<hi>Samaritans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">John 4. 39. 42.</note> and being hereby brought
unto him, we afterwards hear him our
ſelves, and believe now, for his own word
ſake; <hi>That he is God, and the Father of
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Saviour of the
World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are ſo far from ſlighting or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temning
the Scripture, that we are the great
admirers of it, and do endeavour to advance
it above all other Writings whatſoever,
and that even in Natural things, though
never ſo accidentally or curſorily handled;
and we had rather that all our other Books,
though very curious, and greatly valuable,
ſhould be burnt; then that one line, nay
one letter, one jot, or tittle of it ſhould in
any wiſe paſs away.</p>
               <p>And on the other hand, I hope I have
perſwaded and prevailed with all my own
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:64566:139"/>
Brethren, to be more wiſe for themſelves,
and more wary in reſpect of others, then
ſome ſevere and jealous-headed cenſorours
have judged them to be: that we may none
of us give the leaſt occaſion for any one to
ſpeak evil of the things they underſtand
not; but by taking heed to a ſure Rule, we
may bring perpetual honour to our own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty,
and ſhame to the looſe profeſſors of
a better. A light and ſuperficial know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
of Natural things, may indeed conſiſt
with Atheiſme, but a deep and a profound
ſearch into them, doth bring Men back
again to God, and neceſſarily bind them
over to Religion. <hi>Solomons</hi> Wiſdome
ſtayed not in the Creatures, though he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
knew ſo great a variety; but did
from them onely (as it were) take its riſe,
and mount higher then the Cedars, even
into Heaven its ſelfe, and there onely could
find its reſt, from whence it had its firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
like the ſpirit of man, <hi>returning to
God that gave it.</hi> Let no Man think he
hath ſufficient knowledg in Natural things,
who hath not by them been directed to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine,
or that he hath viewed the Creatures
enough, who hath not been lead through
them to the Creatour. Nor ſhall ever any
one have my conſent to paſs for a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher,
who keeps himſelf ſo ignorant of the
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:64566:140"/>
Scripture,<note place="margin">Act. 17. 23.</note> as with Devotion to admire that
Academical Inſcription, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg
Natural and Spiritual are not ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
one to another, but that they may
very well agree together, and cohabit in
the ſame Manſion: nay, they are greatly
conductive to the growth and promotion
of each other. None can be a better E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt
then the beloved Phyſician, and
none ſo compleat a Phyſician, as he who is
frequently converſant in the Word of
God; and able to Evangelize: For that
is the Fountain that ſends forth plentifully
of both theſe Waters, and <hi>is alone able to
make a Man perfect, throughly furniſhed to
every good work.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in the laſt place I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
upon the review of what is here writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,
that there are many things herein (I
my ſelf being Judg) which might have
been delivered after another manner, much
more conſonant to thoſe plauſible and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
Doctrines which are the products of
the Induſtry and Ingenuity of this Inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Age. It is far more eaſie to be Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical,
and to overthrow the poſitive aſſerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of others, then to produce anew thoſe
which will prove more firm and laſting, or
to inſtaurate better in their room. But I
queſtion not but the good intention here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:64566:140"/>
will among all honeſt and Candid Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
in ſome meaſure, compenſate for all
thoſe miſcarriages; eſpecially ſince by this
leading attempt, in a way ſo obſcure and
difficult, and withall ſo untrodden, Men of
the greateſt parts and abilities will be indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
for the future to ſtep into, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
painfull labourers in, the Vineyard of
God.</p>
               <p>Which will be a moſt acceptable work
to the whole Chriſtian World, and moſt
honourable to themſelves; For as <hi>Hiram</hi>
was eminent in <hi>Tyre,</hi> for his Wiſdom, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,<note place="margin">1 King 7. 14.</note>
and Cunning in all manner of
Workmanſhip, yet that which crowned all
his Excellencies, and renowned him to this
very day, was, that he came to the adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Temple of God at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
Thoſe Learned Men who exerciſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in Natural Philoſophy alone, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
onely Newes-Books for the preſent
Generation, and ſo a little time doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
all together: Whereas the labour
that is taken in the Word of God, is of a
far more durable nature, and is like to run
Parallel with everlaſting truth.</p>
               <p>But yet more particularly, I cannot but
call for help upon this individual Subject:
It is my earneſt deſire that Phyſicians
would ſtudy the Gerocomical part of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:64566:141"/>
more then they do: And indeed no
part wants our help ſo much as this; for
among all the Verboſious <hi>Graecians</hi> there is
not one compleat Tract upon this Subject
onely: And there are but very few to be
found among all other Writers, and thoſe
ſo miſerable and barren, that the Readers
are left exceedingly in the dark, and can
ſcarcely be reſolved in the firſt queſtion
belonging thereunto, namely to what part
of Phyſick it moſt properly appertaines.
That one Aphoriſme of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> which
a Man might eaſily prove (would it not
give occaſion to ſome foul-Mouthed Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellers
farther to detract from the reverence
due to Antiquity) is not <hi>Totum teres atque

                     </gap>o. ult.</note> perfect and compleat in all
things; hath ſcarce been out-done for theſe
2000 ſucceeding years.</p>
               <p>Now, as this part of Phyſick needs it
moſt, ſo I am as bold to ſay, it is as capable
of improvement as any other part whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever;
And the improvement that may be
made thereof would be as uſeful to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
as any one diſcovery of Nature, that
hath at any time hitherto been made. Let
none give over their Patients when they
come to be burdened with the infirmities of
Age, as though they were altogether unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of having any good done unto them;
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:64566:141"/>
for, as this will argue great weakneſs and
ignorance in the Phyſician, ſo it is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
curelty to the Patient; For, as <hi>the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
in his work is brother to a great waſter;</hi>
ſo thoſe that are negligent towards their
ancient Friends, are very neer of kin to
thoſe inhumane <hi>Barbarians</hi> and <hi>Americans,</hi>
who with great pomp and alacrity, both
kill and devour them; thinking thereby
they perform a moſt charitable office, in
delivering them from thoſe incurable ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladies,
which will for ever render them mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable:
But ſure an induſtrious Artiſt
may find out wayes to be charitable at a
more merciful rate. The Methods which
are already known to ſome more quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted
herein then their fellowes, do abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
teach us, that although a perfect
cure is not to be propoſed or hoped for;
yet a conſervative cure in reſpect of Age,
and, a compleat Cure in reſpect of ſome of
the diſeaſes before mentioned, and a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liative
in reſpect of moſt of them, may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily
be effected. A convenient Diet, and
meet Applications of proper Medicines
(ſuppoſed alwayes, the bleſſing of God
thereupon) cannot but preſerve old Men,
and hinder and keep off thoſe Miſeries
which otherwiſe would ſooner creep upon
them, and give much eaſe, and very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:64566:142"/>
rebukes, to the violent aſſaults of
all thoſe, that have already taken poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
But thoſe things which are already
known by the moſt knowing Men in the
World, are little or nothing in compariſon
of thoſe that remain yet to be known up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this Subject. The high and ſupreame
matters thereof being yet unattempted by
any, cannot but ſtir up more ſedulous and
active Phyſicians to be aiming at leaſt at
the attaining them; wherein if they ſhall
not poſſibly accompliſh to their full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
their intended purpoſe, yet ſurely
they will much out-doe all thoſe who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
themſelves with Projects of a lower
Sphear.</p>

               <p>The reaſons why Perſons in this Age

               <p>And yet farther, it ſeems not to me in

may be reſtored to ſuch a meaſure, which
may ſafely be called, The renewing of

Nay, this <hi>Elihu,</hi> one of <hi>Jobs</hi>
friends, doth abundantly prove, from the
power and providence of God, when he
ſaith;<note place="margin">Job 33. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>His fleſh ſhall be freſher than a childs,
he ſhall return to the daies of his youth.</hi> And
thoſe Critical returns of nature, (which
are vulgarly called lightnings before death)
that do uſually continue but for two or
three hours or daies at the moſt; are not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
ſometime by the ſtrength of
nature only; lengthned out to ſo many
weeks or months; and there can no reaſon
be given, why a skilful and ſucceſsful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt,
