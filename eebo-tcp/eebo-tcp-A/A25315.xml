            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE Right HONOURABLE JOHN, Earl of <hi>Bridgewater,</hi> Viscount <hi>Brackley,</hi> Baron of <hi>Elsemere,</hi> Lord Lieutenant of the County of <hi>Bucks,</hi> and one of His Majesties Most Honourable <hi>Privy Council.</hi>
            </head>
            <salute>MY LORD,</salute>
            <p>THE first Fruits, by the Law of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> were due to God, yet is it no violati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now of the Laws of
<pb facs="tcp:51065:3"/>
heaven, in some proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to shew our just e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem of those who are so much like it here on earth: Hence it is that I presume to Dedicate these my first endeavors of this kind to Your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships Patronage and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection; and I could wish that the first productions of Art and Study were like those of Nature, that is, the best and most perfect in their kind, that so the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent might more resemble it's Patron.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51065:3"/>I do not present this to Your Honor, as if you stood in need of Transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, for in this respect You perhaps are the most improper Person in the Kingdom to make such Dedications to, being Your self so Great a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, not only of the <hi>French,</hi> but also of the more Ancient and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Languages. But I look upon my self under some obligation of justice, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn that to Your accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, which was the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult
<pb facs="tcp:51065:4"/>
of some few hours, which I should have counted stoln from Your Lordships Service, but that such is your Candour and benign Temper, such Your great love and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to all commendable Studies, that You and they seem to have the same Ends, and the same Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ests; thus what ever time is employ'd in them, You are pleas'd to look upon it as spent in Your own Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>But this is not all the
<pb facs="tcp:51065:4"/>
right You may justly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to this Translation, Your Title to it seems yet more particular; wherein such was your Favour and Condescension, that, as it would be Ingratitude to conceal, so would it be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Arrogance to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (pardon the pride of the expression) I had the Honour to be instructed by Your Lordship in the <hi>French Tongue</hi>; You be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleas'd, not only to peruse, but in many places
<pb facs="tcp:51065:5"/>
to Correct it, so that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not now so properly chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge any thing therein my own, as the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.</p>
            <p>And now I hope you will pardon this my inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Ambition, if I desire to publish my Gratitude, and that sense of my Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, which is too big to be confin'd in a private breast.</p>
            <p>How acceptable this Treatise may be to the World, I know not, yet this I know, that I should
<pb facs="tcp:51065:5"/>
have sufficiently oblig'd the Age, if in the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I had given it Your Lordship's just Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter; this being the most probable way to provoke men to the love and imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Vertue, not to represent it in Idea and Speculation only, but as it appears both more amiable in it self and more prevalent on others, when thus incorporated in the lives and practices of Noble Persons: But this though a true and
<pb facs="tcp:51065:6"/>
just Relation, would be as uneasie for You to hear, as it would be difficult, yea above the power of my Pen to perform: Thus a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things, Your own Temper concurs in this, to make You Heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally Vertuous, that is, a follower of Vertue mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for Vertues sake, since Your modesty will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the common &amp; cheap Reward of a due Praise and just Commendation.</p>
            <p>But yet I could wish that I had not so much to
<pb facs="tcp:51065:6"/>
plead for the seasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Discourse, in an Age where Infidelity on the one hand, &amp; Fanatical Enthusiasm on the other, seem to divide the greater part of the World; where some men look upon all Divine Revelations to be mere Dreams, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers mistake their mere Dreams for Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations: Now what more proper and season<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in these circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, then that which is the design of this Discourse,
<pb facs="tcp:51065:7"/>
that is, to evidence the Grounds and Reasons why we receive those that are truly Divine, and reject the vain pretences of others?</p>
            <p>And to whom could the Dedication be more suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able then to one whose Principles and Practices at once confirm and adorn the Religion you profess; whose well-settled judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and understanding of Your Religion in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and Your great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to the Church of
<pb facs="tcp:51065:7"/>
               <hi>England</hi> in particular, render You equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from the Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Romanists, and the Novelties of later En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thusiasts?</p>
            <p>My Lord, I shall not any further by a tedious address misemploy those precious minutes, which are usually spent either in Your serious and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Studies, or in more publick Employments: I shall only beg, that God would long continue You amongst us, and bless
<pb facs="tcp:51065:8"/>
Your endeavours in set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling and securing the Kingdom by Your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and supporting the Church by Your constant Affection; which is the hearty Prayer of</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>I Shall not go about to make any tedious Apologies for the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of this Treatise, being conscious to my self of the innocence of my intentions, that, however I may be mistaken in my apprehensions, or have fail'd in my design, yet I did intend herein, not to offend, but to serve thee; for I am not of the temper of those, who would rather commit a deliberate crime, then want an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
<pb facs="tcp:51065:9"/>
of Apologizing: the reasons then inducing me hereunto were princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally these two:
<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>1.</hi> Because those who have not stock enough of their own to trade withall, are not altogether unservice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Commonwealth, by becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Carriers and conveyers of other men's goods; and Translations, I conceive bear some resemblance here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and if it be for the benefit, and advantage of a Kingdom, to bring in the Riches of Forreign Countries, then certainly can it not be disservice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Commonwealth of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make the works of other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons intelligible to our own, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Law there may be in particular against other things of the <hi>French</hi> Nation, yet there is none against the Importation of their Learning.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>2.</hi> This Treatise, if we consider the
<pb facs="tcp:51065:9"/>
whole Series and Method of it's man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement, seems a sufficient vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the sober use of Reason in matters of Religion; if we reflect upon those natural and necessary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions which the Learned Author makes from certain and undoubted Principles, and those other rational motives of credibility, which he makes use of, to prove those dreams he there treats of, to be truly Divine.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Yet not so as to exclude that secret sense and inward consciousness, which was the immediate result of the Divine Impression made upon their minds by the Spirit of God, especially in those dreams and visions, where particular and personal commands were convey'd to any of his Servants, as to <hi>Joseph</hi> to convey our Saviour into <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here I am very sensible that this reason of its publication, <hi>viz.</hi> the
<pb facs="tcp:51065:10"/>
asserting the use of Reason in matters of Religion, will by some be thought rather fit to have prevail'd with me to have let it laid still buried in its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>French,</hi> lest by this means the contagion should still further prevail in the <hi>English</hi> Nation.</p>
            <p>How far an extravagant opinion of the power &amp; extent of Reason may have possess'd some, I know not, yet this is certain, that we must not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wholly reject it, because others have overvalued it, or by some other ways abus'd it; we must not forbid our selves the use of fire &amp; water, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some have employ'd both to their own ruine: For by this way of arguing, we must bid Adieu not only to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but Scripture too, which has been abus'd, not only by great pretenders to Reason, but by ignorant and unstable men, to their own destruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51065:10"/>But then if we would either pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the rise, or stop the growth of any such opinions amongst us, the way to do it, I conceive, is not to suspect our friends, (such who are not only free from errour herein, but also very able and willing too, to defend the true An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Catholick Faith in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar) not, I say, to suspect our friends, but so to treat our open and profess'd enemies, the <hi>Socinians,</hi> in such a sound way and Method of proceeding as may be the most effectual to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them, or however to secure our selves; that is, First, with strength of Reason; Secondly, with Candor and Ingenuity of Temper.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> With strength of Reason, thus to baffle them at that weapon, which they pretend to be so much their own, though in deed and truth, they cannot lay such a just claim &amp; undoubted title
<pb facs="tcp:51065:11"/>
to it, for in many things they perhaps are the weakest arguers of any sort of men whatever; yet seeing they are such pretenders to it, we must deal with them accordingly, by the strictest and severest methods of reasoning: for a good cause cannot suffer more, then either by too violent an urging of weak arguments, or an unskilful managing of good ones; and a weak defence, like a cold petition, is its own answer, and a kind of giving up the cause we pretend to plead for, besides it brings a disreputation to truth to see its Patrons and Defenders worsted.</p>
            <p>In order therefore to our more suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful proceeding herein, in all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal disputes with these Adversaries, they ought not to demand, nor should we grant them any other part, then that of an Opponent, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son is, because ours is the Ancient

Truth, which has been in the posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Church long before their opinion was ever thought of, and therefore we must be suppos'd in rightful possession of it, till the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry be prov'd: which they will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver able to do, seeing their great Art and Policy consists rather in evading the force of our arguments, then in trusting to any of their own.</p>
            <p>I speak not this, as if our Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, was not as well able to confute its adversaries, as to defend it self, provided only that they would but acknowledge so much reason and ingenuity, as not to look upon frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous evasions for solid answers, which if they do, they then seem to labour of a certain weakness of mind, something like that of Scepticism, only the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks they deny or doubt of every thing, these by the like unreasonable
<pb facs="tcp:51065:12"/>
principles, do or may assert any thing, and thus in stead of being what they so much pretend to be, such Masters of Reason, they hereby destroy the very foundations of all rational discourse.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> We should treat them with all Candour and Ingenuity of Behaviour, for our Reasons and Arguments will be then the more likely to convince their understandings, if withall we endeavour to oblige their affections, however not provoke their passions.

            </p>
            <p>And having gone thus far in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to the objection, give me leave to enquire a little further into the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
<pb facs="tcp:51065:12"/>
of the cause; what there is in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son so destructive of Religion, that the very name of the one should seem heretical in the other; what is it wherein Reason hath so highly offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that it should be excluded the Temple, and from having any thing to do in matters of Religion. Doth that Religion, which once commanded us to give a reason of the hope that is in us, doth it require nothing now, but blind obedience? Was Reason re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd, as it were in the very infancy and first ages of the Church, and is it now become useless, nay dangerous in its riper years? Is that which is the imperfection of old age, <hi>viz.</hi> the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of our intellectuals, is it now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the perfection of our faith? The Heathens indeed, they look'd upon a Prophetick fury and alienation of mind to be either a necessary concomitant or
<pb facs="tcp:51065:13"/>
a certain effect of their inspiration. The Turks they look upon mad men and fools as the only Prophets and men inspir'd, and we know what Church it is that asserts ignorance to be the Mother of Devotion: But we have not thus learned Christ; for our Religion doth not go about to build the Christian upon the ruines of the Man, nor do we then cease to be Rational when we become Religious, Religion being founded, and as it were grafted upon the stock of Reason. Thus the Moral Law is either the same with, or found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Light and Law of Nature; and the Christian Law, though it be above them both, yet is it not contrary to either.</p>
            <p>Thus Reason and Religion do friendlily agree, and mutually conspire to support each other; for Religion improves Reason, and Reason thus
<pb facs="tcp:51065:13"/>
improv'd and enlightned, defends Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and as on the one hand the mysterys of our Faith are so far from being any real ground of an objection against it, that indeed they render it more Divine and Venerable; for we might perhaps justly question the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of that Religion, wherein we see nothing above the power of a finite understanding, either at first to find out or afterwards to comprehend; so on the other hand the sutableness there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to our rational faculties in other things, is no less a commendation and confirmation of it: for to say that God should institute an unreasonable Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, is such a foolish assertion as needs no confutation; for certainly God would either have given us a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion sutable to our Faculties, or Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties sutable to our Religion.</p>
            <p>If it be here objected that God and
<pb facs="tcp:51065:14"/>
Scripture condemns Reason, and that it doth not become us to dispute against the express Commands of God; To this I answer, that Scripture doth no where condemn that Reason which I here plead for; but all those places which they urge against it, may and must be interpreted either concerning the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the <hi>Jews,</hi> or the doubtful and disputatious Philosophy of the Gentiles, either of the Science falsly so call'd, which the Gnostics so boast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, or of meer Natural Reason, as such, destitute of Divine Revelation; Or, lastly of the carnal Appetites of Christians, of the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, that Law of the members warring against the Law of the mind. Secondly by Reason we know the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and by Reason we come to the true meaning and sense of them, and by Reason we know the obligation that
<pb facs="tcp:51065:14"/>
lies upon us therefrom, and without this it is not easie to conceive a way how God could either have convey'd the knowledge of his Will to us, or of our Duty to him; and it is not proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that Scripture should condemn that, without which all its own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands would signifie very little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>
            <p>I shall here therefore briefly enquire into the nature of Reason, both as it was in innocence before the Fall, and as it is now in this state of deprava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the want of a right distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishing herein hath been the cause of many errors and mistakes about the power and properties of it; however 'tis that which must needs cause a great deal of obscurity in what is said concerning it, in this complex'd and undistinguish'd capacity.</p>
            <p>And this is that which seems
<pb facs="tcp:51065:15"/>
the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the first funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental error in Mr. <hi>Hobs</hi> his <hi>Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,</hi> that he doth not sufficiently distinguish betwixt pure and corrupted Nature; so that there must needs be a great deal of falshood in some things and confusion in others, when he as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes that to Nature in general, which doth not belong to it but in such a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular respect and private considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Reason in innocence was that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Principle, that Divine Light set up in the soul of man, which bore an equal respect to truth and goodness, by which we were both instructed in our duty and enabled to perform it; it was part of that Divine Image, wherein Man was created, and that which directed both the speculative and practical dictates of the understanding to their respective ends; <hi>viz.</hi> to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
<pb facs="tcp:51065:15"/>
of the Divine Wisdom in matters of speculation, and yielding obedience to his will in matters of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise.</p>
            <p>Now did right Reason enjoy an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal, and undisturb'd Empire, now was there not that contrariety in the faculties of the soul, but what was Knowledge in the understanding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately became Obedience in the will and affections; now was Reason and Righteousness, as it were the very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the man; nor was there any further need of Supernatural Grace to be super added to him, besides what was naturally contain'd in these Essential Principles of his constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which made him such as God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd him, <hi>viz.</hi> a Man in Innocence.</p>
            <p>This was the state of Reason before the Fall and it yet remains the same in substance, though not in the same degree
<pb facs="tcp:51065:16"/>
of purity and perfection, as before; it is the reliques of the Divine Image, yet remaining in us, by which we are still enabled in some measure to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand truth and practise our duty; it is that power or faculty of the soul, or the soul it self, as it contains in it the principles and foundations of ratioci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and a power and ability of drawing right consequences therefrom, but yet so obscur'd and weakned, that there is now need of Divine Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and assistance for the perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that which before we were able of our selves to do: But then though God did thus punish man by taking away part of that strength which he had so misemploy'd; which was the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of his justice, yet did not his good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness suffer him to sink below himself, though he became weak and guilty, yet he remained a man; his faculties,
<pb facs="tcp:51065:16"/>
though deprav'd, yet were they not annihilated, and as the Principle is not wholly taken away, so neither are the Acts and Exercises thereof neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily false; so that we are not aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd to an eternal Scepticism, but we have still sufficient grounds of truth and certainty within our selves, for we had better have no such faculties as pretend to Reason, then such as should always deceive us even in things that we clearly and distinctly perceive. And here may be as strong arguments drawn from the goodness of God, that the punishment of the first sin did not extend to an absolute falsification or total corruption of our faculties, as there may be from his veracity, that he gave us true ones at first; for indeed to assert Reason thus wholly corrupted, would be to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce such a confusion and disorder
<pb facs="tcp:51065:17"/>
into the nature of things as is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with the notion of a Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, such an one, as we should think that God would rather have annihila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the whole race of mankind, then ever have suffer'd it in the world.</p>
            <p>And this is the true State of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in it self before the Fall, and as it is in us now since, only here we must further know that this natural Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Reason in Christians is further enlightned and inabled by the Divine Revelation of his Will, and by the assistances and influences of his holy Spirit.</p>
            <p>I could wish therefore that those men would speak more intelligibly, who go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to give such particular &amp; distinct differences betwixt the Spiritual and meer Rational Man, as they call him, in their Actions relating to Religion, as if there was any Character either
<pb facs="tcp:51065:17"/>
more certain in it self, or more war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable to us, to judge of the Spirit of God in a man by, then by it's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the effects of Righteousness in him; That the Principles of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reason and Grace are two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct things, flowing from different Fountains, is certainly true; but then why we should oppose these two, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in a Christian State, where God is never wanting by his grace to assist the humble and sincere exercises of Mens Reasons, where the more truly Rational any Men are, the more Spiritual they are, and the more Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual the more truly Rational; here actually to distinguish betwixt the Spiritual and meer Rational Man, when the same effects of real Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness equally appear in both, this is arrogantly to take upon himself that which is only proper to
<pb facs="tcp:51065:18"/>
God, to be a searcher of hearts.</p>
            <p>As for that place of <hi>1 Cor. 2. 14.</hi> upon the misunderstanding whereof they seem principally to found this their opinion, <hi>but the natural man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth not the things of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, for they are foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness unto him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discern'd</hi>; here by the Natural Man is not meant the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Rational Man, but a man en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow'd only with the Principles of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Reason, void of Evangelical Grace and Divine Revelation; now this cannot be apply'd to a Christian who enjoys both in their respective degrees: so that the true meaning of that place is briefly this,
<hi rend="margQuotes">That the matters reveal'd in the Gospel and Preach'd by the Apostles were such, as the Learned Philosophers of the
<pb facs="tcp:51065:18"/>
Heathens and others, who were only led by Humane Reason, did abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely despise as seeming foolishness unto them, nor could they by any Study of their own come to the knowledge of them, for they were only to be had by understanding the prophesies of Scripture, and other such means as depend upon Divine Revelation:</hi>
so that the Christian doth receive and believe the Gospel and the things therein contained, by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments drawn from the Scriptures themselves, by prophesies and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and other evidences of Divine Revelation afforded therein, and by the assistances of the Spirit of God deriv'd therefrom, but then this doth not exclude but include Reason, for grace is not a super addition of a new faculty, but a new power and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to the old.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51065:19"/>Now I see no reason, why those who are Baptis'd into the same Faith, and live in the same Christian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and give all due obedience to the Laws of God and Man, according to their power, why any such should be suppos'd to act from a Principle of meer Natural Reason, and not also from that of a truly Divine, and in its own nature, Saving Grace, and that for no other Reason, but only because some few men, who are highly conceited of themselves, and censori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of others, who pretend to a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopoly of the Spirit, and as it were to a Commission from Heaven to pass sentence on all who differ from them, only because these men are pleas'd to vote whomsoever they will, Formal, Moral and <hi>meer Rational Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But indeed those who are thus par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular in describing how far a <hi>meer
<pb facs="tcp:51065:19"/>
Rational Man</hi> may go in matters of Religion, what sins he may avoid and what duties he may perform, and yet have nothing of the true Spirit of God and Saving Grace; these men, however they may pretend and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps really are great enemies to <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagianism,</hi> yet they seem herein to be too great exalters of the power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and in all probability too uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable censurers of <hi>Divine Grace,</hi> whilst they attribute all the good works perform'd by those meer Rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Men either to the Power of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or to Common Grace, as they call it, which, according to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation and explication of it, is little better, seeing it is neither in it's own nature sufficient nor by Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment intended to bring any one to Salvation; that distinction therefore betwixt Common and Saving Grace,
<pb facs="tcp:51065:20"/>
as Grace, doth signifie those inward motions of the Divine Spirit, by which we are enabled to believe and practise aright, according to this acceptation, it hath no foundation in Scripture; for all such Grace is in its own nature suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, and by Gods appointment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd to bring Salvation, if we by our own fault do not hinder the event; though it be granted, that this also may differ in degrees. Among other grounds and reasons of this their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake, this seems not the least, that they entertain too mean apprehensions of that Covenant which God hath made with Christians and their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and also of the Sacrament of Baptism, by which they are admitted members of Christs Church: Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding both these, they look upon a man before a certain critical mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of conversion, as they suppose
<pb facs="tcp:51065:20"/>
it, little better then an heathen, and that all the good works that they have or can perform before it, stand them in little or no stead, in order to their Conversion, and that after this, all the wickedness that they do or can commit, shall do them no prejudice in reference to their Salvation, which opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is of very bad consequence to the concernments of a Christian Life.</p>
            <p>But here we must also know, that there is need of a continued course of Sanctification throughout our whole lives, both to compleat and perfect that holiness first begun in us, and also by reason of those many sins and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, which we are all subject to, which are to be turned from by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance and reformation.</p>
            <p>And as this opposition betwixt the <hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>meer Rational</hi> Man, is without any warrant from Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:51065:21"/>
so is it very difficult, if at all possible, to assign the exact limits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Grace and Reason in our selves, and then much more in others.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> In our selves, it is very hard to say that this was an Action of our Reason only, that an Act of the more immediate assistance of the Divine Spirit, <hi>Joh. 3.8. the wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth where it listeth, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but canst not tell whence it cometh, and whether it goeth, so is every one that is born of the Spirit,</hi> thus he that is born anew, is discern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably another kind of man then he was before, thus his new birth is seen by the fruits, though the beginnings, and the modes of procedure, and the means of conveying this to him be undiscern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, <hi>Mark 4. 26. 27. so is the kingdom of God,</hi> that is, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb facs="tcp:51065:21"/>
of Grace; <hi>as if a man should cast feed into the ground, and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, he knoweth not how.</hi> These are the more ordinary methods of the Divine Spirit, but then when God calls out some particular persons on some great and eminent em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, either to do or suffer in his service, he frequently confers more sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible influences of his Grace and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit on such; Neither is this spoken in the least to oppose the joys and consolations of the Holy Ghost, nor the sober and well-grounded experiences of Pious Men.</p>
            <p>And as we cannot distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these in our selves, much less can we do it in others, for if a man be outwardly pious, and give no just occasion of suspecting his real honesty
<pb facs="tcp:51065:22"/>
and sincerity, whether such an one be notwithstanding an hypocrite, this is best known to God and his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; yet we by the Laws of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are to judge the best, but if such an one under all this, be an hypocrite, this is that which a man may also be under the highest pretences to the Spirit; so that it is only the event, that must determine the truth and sincerity of men's professions.</p>
            <p>The sum of what I here intend, is this, that, provided we become new men, if we cease to sin and learn to do well, if we turn from wickedness and perform real and sincere obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the Laws of God, as the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit indeed is, so must it be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd to be the principal cause of this change in us, yet we need not here trouble our selves too nicely to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the exact limits, how far our
<pb facs="tcp:51065:22"/>
Reason, as a less principal cause ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might, or might not be instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental herein.</p>
            <p>But the proper use and just extent of Reason will further appear by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering it's object, which is the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God and the Divine Will, the knowledge of our selves and the nature of things, so far as these or any of these come under humane cognisance, so far as they are either our perfection to know, or our duty to practise; so that nothing but either the impossibility or the unlawfulness of the enquiry must limit the exercise of our Reasons, thus must we not indulge either an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant curiosity on the one hand, nor an idle supine negligence on the other, for it would argue presumption in us to pry into those hidden things which God hath reserv'd to himself, as it would sloth and ingratitude, not make use
<pb facs="tcp:51065:23"/>
of our faculties for those purposes, that God design'd them for.</p>
            <p>And there have not been wanting those who have erred in both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, first the Pelagians and Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, who make Reason the great rule of faith and manners, who scarce acknowledge any other authority, or ground of their belief, or higher prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of action: others there have been who too much undervalue it, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe not only too little to it, but look upon it as a dangerous and pernicious thing, as if it was the Devils instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to undermine the foundations of Faith and all true Religion; some in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed have set it in the throne and then fallen down in adoration to it, others on the contrary have unjustly vilify'd that which is indeed a ray of Divinity, and I know not whether have been more to blame, or done more disservice
<pb facs="tcp:51065:23"/>
to Religion, those who have ador'd it as a God, or those who have rejected it as a Devil.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore briefly show the power of Reason in some things and its weakness and inability in others, and give some particular instances of both.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Reason is a guide to a man in the choice of his Religion in general, that is, supposing an Heathen in doubt of his own and desirous to fix upon the true Religion; here rightly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine his choice, he hath no other way but to bring the several pretenders to the test of Reason, and examine them by those Rules, that Reason dictates to be the Characters of truth and certainty, that is, by the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableness and correspondence they bear to the notions of God and the nature of things, to those inward impressions they have of vertue and goodness im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed
<pb facs="tcp:51065:24"/>
upon their minds, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they come confirmed with the outward attestation of true and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned miracles: and here authority, as such, ought not to be urged, nor can it be of any force in this consideration, though it must be also granted, that the concurrent testimony of different parties is very considerable herein, as when the matters of fact relating to our Saviour and his Religion are not only granted, but attested by all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not only friends but enemies, when both the Iews and Heathens do grant his miracles; whereas those that other Religions pretend unto, being both in their own nature, more sleight and frivolous, more phantastick and a<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry, then solid and substantial, and really serviceable to the glory of God and the good of men, in this respect they are less worthy of God and less agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb facs="tcp:51065:24"/>
to the nature of miracles, and also wanting the universality of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testation, they are more liable to cheat and imposture. And here the certain evidence of humane testimony is of more force to convince a man, then the pretence of Divine Authority; I say, then the pretence, for in many it is only so, and that which is real is to him no more, for as yet be doth not believe any of them to be Divine, but from the strength of their respective Reasons and Arguments must conclude them so.</p>
            <p>And here the use of Reason will be more particularly necessary to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish betwixt true and false mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, now a miracle being something above the power of natural causes to perform, it will be very difficult right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to assign the just limits of the power of nature, to be able to say thus far can it extend, and no further;
<pb facs="tcp:51065:25"/>
and that which still augments the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, is, rightly to know how far the Devils power may extend in things of this nature, whether first he can by his own native power work mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles; which seems not so reasonable to believe he can, for then mankind would almost have laid under a fatal necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of being impos'd upon by his power and malice, Miracles being as it were the Great Seal of Heaven, which God makes use of to confirm the truth of Doctrines.</p>
            <p>But then nothing hinders, but that the Devil may by his knowledg of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture either so fitly apply natural agents to the producing of such effects, as may require a good degree of Reason and Philosophy to distinguish them from Real Miracles, or may by God, for Reasons best known to himself, be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted sometimes to work true ones.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51065:25"/>Yet not so, but that upon a strict and due consideration of the circumstances of the Action, or the end and design of the thing, there will something appear whereby to distinguish such a miracle from those which are the more genuine and immediate results of the Divine Power. To this we may further add, that the Divine Providence is parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly concern'd, where there seems as it were a competition betwixt the power of God and the power of the Devil (as in the case of <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Magicians of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and in others proportionably) there some ways to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in confirmation and approbation of the one, and in discovering either the absolute cheats and impostures, or the comparative weakness and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of the other.</p>
            <p>The sum of what I here intend is this, that by using our Reason, and the
<pb facs="tcp:51065:26"/>
Rules thereby afforded us, we may distinguish betwixt the delusions of Satan, and Divine miracles, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this it will be impossible to do it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> We should continue Christians upon the same Grounds and Reasons that others first became such, that is, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a due considering and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our Religion, so that we may both be the more confirm'd in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of it our selves, and may be the better enabled to give an account of it to others; thus should we be Christians upon choice and consideration, and not only because it is the Religion of our Country. It is not sufficient for us meerly to be baptised into the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith, but we must our selves un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand and undertake what the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of our Birth and Education first Entitled us to.</p>
            <p>Yet this is not so to be understood as
<pb facs="tcp:51065:26"/>
if Christians were Sceptically to doubt of their Religion, or so far to indulge the extravagancy of their enquiries, as for the present to suspend the belief of their own, and to be in an equal indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferency to all Religions; yet may they piously enquire into the Grounds and Reasons of their Faith, being warrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed herein both from Precept and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample in Scripture.</p>
            <p>And as in the other particular; Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son was necessary to distinguish be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt true and false Miracles, so is it here to judge of Doctrines; that so we may preserve that Faith once delivered to the Saints free from errour or cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption either in Principles or Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: and indeed when once we bid adieu to Reason, we then open a gate to all those errours and fanaticisms, which either the malice of the Devil, or the impostures of men, or our own cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
<pb facs="tcp:51065:27"/>
natures may suggest, we deprive our selves of that which God design'd for our defence, and expose our selves naked to the power and malice of our enemies.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> Reason is necessary to determine the lawfulness of some actions and the expediency of others; for it was impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible for Scripture to descend to all the particulars of humane life, much less to all the circumstances of them it was sufficient for it to have laid down some General Principles, it being now the Office of Reason to apply particular instances to these General Rules; and that which renders Reason here fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther necessary, is, because that vertue for the most part consisting in the middle betwixt two opposite vices there is need of a careful and steady atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, lest while we endeavour to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the one extreme, we unwarily run
<pb facs="tcp:51065:27"/>
into the other: and here Reason will in many cases be very useful to us rightly to determine the just limits of our duty, only we must not make this bad use hereof, always to go to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most extent of what is lawful, we must not live always upon the very confines betwixt vice and vertue; for this would be to chuse to walk upon the very brink of a precipice, where perhaps we may be safe, but the action would never be counted prudent. This would be only to make use of Reason to teach us how little we might be vertuous, and how far unwise. And this possibly may be one Reason why many times it is so hard to assign the precise boundaries betwixt vice and vertue, exactly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine where the one ends and the other begins; because God never de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign'd us to make use of that speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but to keep our selves within the
<pb facs="tcp:51065:28"/>
measures of prudence and safety.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> I shall shew the weakness and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections of Reason, and what those things are wherein it is deficient.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> It is not in the Power of Reason to have found out the mysteries of our Religion, nor the methods of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for these do either depend upon the Essential Nature of God, or the free determination of his will: both which are unsearchable by humane Reason.</p>
            <p>Whether therefore the <hi>Platonick Triad,</hi> or the threefold principle mention'd by <hi>Plato</hi> and his followers, be the same with or may upon just grounds be apply'd to the Christian Trinity, may be justly question'd; for it must be a very favourable interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that infers an Unity in the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and Trinity in Unity from <hi>Plato</hi>'s Principle: yet whatever knowledge he might have of a Trinity,
<pb facs="tcp:51065:28"/>
this was neither born with him, nor was it the result of his natural reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but it came to him by tradition either from the Iews, or from those who had it thence; as the greatest as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serters of the <hi>Platonick</hi> Trinity do acknowledge.</p>
            <p>Whether <hi>Orpheus, Trismegist</hi> or <hi>Plato</hi> had indeed any true knowledge or distinct notions of a Trinity, I shall not here undertake to determine, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that after the great pains and Study that some men have bestow'd herein, such is the obscurity of those Authors expressions, such the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and various interpretations put upon them by men of different opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, such the doubted truth and credit of some of those writings, such the loose conjectures rather then necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry consequences made from the whole, that the result of all seems only this,
<pb facs="tcp:51065:29"/>
that possibly it may be thus, and pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly it may be otherwise.</p>
            <p>So that I am apt to believe that men do not entertain this or that opinion for the necessary cogency of the Arguments on either side, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the agreeableness, that this or that opinion may have to the tenour of their former Studies, and to the Authors they have been most conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant in, or bear the greatest affection for, or for some other collateral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, rather then Reasons of Belief.</p>
            <p>I shall therefore on this occasion with all indifferency propose these few considerations, which thou mayst re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive or reject, as thou seest convenient.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:51065:30"/>
in it those mysteries which the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans look'd upon as the peculiar Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of their Religion: thus did they vie <hi>Platonism</hi> with Christianity, equalling it in all things, relating ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to Speculation or Practise with the Christian Doctrine; thus did the appearance of the Gospel in the world rectifie the Philosophy of the Gentiles in some things, and made them ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to conform their notions to the Christian Religion, as far as they thought convenient, in others.</p>
                  <p>Another sort of men who might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the belief of the <hi>Platonick Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> were profess'd Christians, yet such as had no mind to believe any thing of this Christian Mystery; and these men boldly asserted that the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was only a Pagan notion brought out of <hi>Plato's</hi> School into the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Doctrine: Thus did they endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
<pb facs="tcp:51065:30"/>
to disparage what they had no mind to believe, but yet withal sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd that it was in <hi>Plato,</hi> thinking it a sufficient Argument, either of it's falseness or unfitness to be made part of the Christian belief, because the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (say they) was taken from a Pagan Philosopher.</p>

                  <p>I shall not here Dogmatically assert any thing, nor shall I oppose the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Traditionists; yet I think we need not too operously contend for it nor lay more stress and weight upon that Argument, then the evidence

thereof will bear, because the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Trinity doth neither depend upon, nor stand in need of it: As for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability of Reason to find out those me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of Salvation now reveal'd in the Gospel, I shall have occasion to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it hereafter.</p>

            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> The mysteries of our Religion, as they could not be at first found out, so neither can they be now fully compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by Natural Reason, and this is that which Reason it self acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, that it is not in the power of a finite capacity fully to comprehend the mysteries of an infinite Being; yet are these very mysteries so far as neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be believ'd in order to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, sufficiently intelligible, being so far clearly laid down in Scripture. But then we must not place our own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate fancies or the doubtful and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverted opinions of particular men
<pb facs="tcp:51065:31"/>
in the number and rank of Divine mysteries, thus coyning more out of our own brains, then God and Scripture ever made. Thus a late Author hath rank'd Reprobation and absolute De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees, in an equal order with the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and Incarnation: but if all the unintelligble opinions, which have been broach'd of late years, must be receiv'd as Divine Mysteries, what a monstrous thing would Religion by this means soon appear?</p>
            <p>Nor doth the belief of this particular hinder us from making the mysteries of our Religion as reasonable and as intelligible as we can, provided only, that we do not make Reason the Rule and Condition of our believing them; we must not reject what we cannot ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly understand, this is both the fault and folly of the Socinians, for herein they shew themselves neither sound
<pb facs="tcp:51065:32"/>
Divines nor good Philosophers; for 'tis probable that if they had been more conversant in Philosophy, they would not have so err'd in Divinity; if they had a little tam'd and corrected the extravagancy of their own conceited abilities with the difficulties of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophy, and a little more us'd their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding to the obedience of nature, they then would not perhaps have thought it such an unreasonable thing to submit to that of Faith, for what an affront is it both to Reason and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion to be so credulous as to believe things altogether unintelligible in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophy, and yet be such <hi>Virtuosi</hi> in Religion, as to believe nothing but what is capable of demonstration, or within the compass of our faculties to comprehend.</p>
            <p>Here we may further defend the mysteries of our Religion, not only from
<pb facs="tcp:51065:32"/>
the Authority of the Speaker, in as much as it is very reasonable to believe, what the God of truth reveals, but also by such subsequent illustrations as may at least facilitate our apprehensions of the thing; and this is that which <hi>Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sius his Creed</hi> makes use of, <hi>as the reasonable soul and body are one man, so God and man are one Christ</hi>; here we may also make use of those Arguments which are call'd <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gumenta ad hominem,</hi> that is, we may consider whether those respective persons, we then deal withal do not believe some things altogether as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable as those things they charge upon us. Thus the heathens have no Reason to object against us the credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of believing upon bare Authority, seeing the <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar did look upon <hi>Pythagoras</hi> his <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> almost of as great Authority,
<pb facs="tcp:51065:33"/>
as the Christians do their <hi>sic dicit Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,</hi> and generally all Sects of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophers did <hi>jurare in verba Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stri,</hi> did yield great honor and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to their respective Founders, nor have they any Reason to object the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceiveableness of the Trinity and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, seeing they believe things concerning their gods altogether as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible as these Christian mysteries.</p>
            <p>And to come a little nearer, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults of the Divine Omnipotence and Omniscience, how God can create some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of nothing, and how he can know the free determinations of our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret thoughts, and these not only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent but future, all which is notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing part of our natural Creed; this perhaps is as unconceiveable as any thing that is contain'd in our reveal'd Religion.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> It is not in the power of meer
<pb facs="tcp:51065:33"/>
natural Reason to perform the precepts of the Christian Religion without the concurrence and assistance of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Spirit. Here for a man to deny either the being of God, or the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Spirit in us, is (to use a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar resemblance) as if we should deny a sharp Rasor to have an edge, because we cannot see it, whereas in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the very invisibility of it is an Argument of its being; or as if we should deny any motion in the world, because we cannot explain the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of it, though here as in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the visibility of the effects doth sufficiently prove the truth of both.</p>
            <p>There are some who argue the duty incumbent on us to believe the Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion, from the benefit that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crues from it to mankind, making this the foundation of their argument, that men naturally ought to believe that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:51065:34"/>
is for their advantage: how far this is true, I shall not here enquire, yet this is certain, that where we have all the Reason in the world to believe a thing, and none to oppose it, where God makes that our duty, which is also our interest; there to deny or disbelieve such a thing, is not only to act against our selves, but to fight against heaven: &amp; of this nature is the belief of the Divine assistance. Such is the amiableness of the Divine Nature, that some are of opinion, that if the Atheist did but frame a notion of it, though he could not believe that there was a God, yet he must necessarily wish there was one; so here such is the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage that accrues to us from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of this Divine Assistance, that, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks, those very men who deny it, ought notwithstanding to believe it, in order to their own designs of acting to the utmost extent of the powers of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb facs="tcp:51065:34"/>
for they might more vigorously exert these, if they liv'd under the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination at least, that they had a greater power then their own concurring with them.</p>
            <p>As for that controversie concerning Grace and moral Vertue, if the question be first clearly stated, and the sense and acceptation of the words justly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, and then the thing calmly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours'd without the heat of contest and disputation, the difference betwixt the contenders on either part seems not so great, but that it seemes easily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable.</p>
            <p>Here Grace may be consider'd in a double sense, either first as it signifies the Divine Assistance, that inward root and Principle of all Christian Vertues and Graces; or secondly, as it signifies the fruits and effects of the Spirit, the Christian Graces themselves, as now
<pb facs="tcp:51065:35"/>
reduc'd into acts and habits: In this lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter sense Moral Vertues, as to the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance and matter of them, are the same with Christian Graces, they differ only in the principle from whence they flow, thus the Christian Vertues and Graces spring from a more Divine Original, then the Moral Vertues of Heathens. In the first sense there are none, but pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess'd <hi>Pelagians,</hi> that assert <hi>morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> or <hi>moral vertue,</hi> in opposition to or derogation from the Divine Assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances; but those who perhaps by some are now thought too great friends and Patrons of it do mean and intend no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of this by it.</p>
            <p>That which hath render'd this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion more obscure and intricate, is, that they are not rightly agreed about the sense and meaning of the word <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality</hi>; some say that by <hi>morality</hi> is properly meant such a degree of vertue
<pb facs="tcp:51065:35"/>
and honesty as is attainable by the mere strength of nature, without the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of Divine Revelation; others by <hi>morality</hi> seem to understand not only this, but also include in it all the assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances and encouragements that attend Christianity. Whether is the properer acceptation of the word I shall not here enquire; yet however those who take it in this latter sense cannot be thought to ascribe too much to the power of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, only they include more in the sense and meaning of the word so taken, then perhaps can properly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to it.</p>
            <p>I shall here only add one considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which refers to Reason in matters of Speculation, and so put an end to this digression.</p>
            <p>'Tis this, that it no ways reflects dishonourably upon Reason, that it is not in its power to convince a Sceptick,
<pb facs="tcp:51065:36"/>
               <hi>Scepticus nec potest alium re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>darguere nec ipse redargui,</hi> and the Reason of both, is, because he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther asserts nor grants any Principles whereby he may either prevail upon others, or he himself be confuted: Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticism is a capricious phrensie of the mind; and it tends no more to the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reputation of Reason that it cannot cure it, then it doth to the dishonor of Grace, that it doth not always capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the perverse wills of wicked men.</p>
            <p>But there are degrees in this Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical humor, and we then seem to retain some Tincture of it, when we unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonably and immoderately undervalue and enervate those Arguments which natural Reason, brings for the proof of some of the Articles of our natural Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> The being of God and the Immortality of the Soul, Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion indeed hath advanc'd these to
<pb facs="tcp:51065:36"/>
higher degrees of certainty, then before they had; but I see not how it tends to the advancement of the Honor of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, by too rigid, if not Sceptical, denials to invalidate all those Arguments that Reason may suggest in proof or confirmation hereof. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, me-thinks, here should not be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as an enemy, but rather help'd and incourag'd then discountenanc'd in so good a design; we should rather procure and maintain a certain rational ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derness and modesty of mind, whereby we should be asham'd either to assert or deny any thing upon unjust grounds; and this temper of mind is equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant from a vain credulity on the one hand, and an unreasonable demanding of demonstrations in matters uncapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of them, on the other, it assents not to things on weaker grounds then Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son may justly require, nor doth it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb facs="tcp:51065:37"/>
more evidence then the nature of things, and the nature of men are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of.</p>
            <p>But I must remember that I write a Preface, not a Treatise, I shall now only premise something concerning the Nature of Prophesie and Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation in general, and so refer thee to the following discourse for further satisfaction.</p>
            <p>An operose attempt to prove that which no sober and considerate man ever went about to deny, would rather weaken, then add any strength to the thing design'd; yet I could wish that ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the affectation of singularity, or a more pernicious design of some in this present age had not render'd the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the truth of Divine Revelation (in opposition to those who would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe all prophesie to some lower prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple) not altogether unnecessary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:51065:37"/>It is indeed both unjust and uncha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritable to suggest unreasonable surmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses of the possible intentions of an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor contrary to his express words; only here give me leave to shew the Reasons why it may be suspected that the Author of <hi>Tractatus Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gico-Politicus,</hi> notwithstanding what he there speaks of it, yet may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed assert no other Prophesie or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, then what is within the power of nature to perform.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> In his sixth Chapter, he absolutely denies all miracles in general, &amp; then it is very inconsistent with, and naturally consequent upon this his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple to deny this of prophesie in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular. The opinion of miracles accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him, is founded in the ignorance of natural causes, since nature never goes out of her fix'd order and settled course, whatever we may weakly or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly
<pb facs="tcp:51065:38"/>
conceive of it, now according to this way of arguing, prophesie may as well be the result either of blind chance or natural causes, though such as are not commonly known, as other miracles. Now the nature and notion of a miracle, doth as well belong to the certain Prediction of future contingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and the declaring and revealing things naturally unknowable, as it doth to those things which leave more immediate and sensible effects behind them: and if God by such an eternal decree hath so fix'd the course of nature, that it can no ways now be alter'd, then prophesie must run the same fate with mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, and he that denies one, if he be consistent with himself, must deny both.</p>

the falsness of the assertion, but only that he doth no where plainly and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tell us, whether the prophesies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in Scripture, be above the power of nature or no, or whether they may not naturally follow from such a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stem of the world as he supposes.</p>

concerning miracles or prophesie, only I shall observe in general, that it is but a very weak way of arguing, which he there uses, <hi>viz.</hi> That because God sometimes makes use of natural causes, or the accidental ministery of some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means in working of miracles, therefore to ascribe the whole causality or efficiency to those things which God for other Reasons thought fit to employ on those occasions, thus he asserts <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> his throwing Ashes into the Air, to be the natural cause of the Biles that thereupon befel the <hi>Egyptians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus also because God makes use of the phansy in the conveying of prophesy, therefore must it wholly be subjected here and reach no farther, therefore he concludes that the Prophets prophesy'd according to the various temperaments and complexion of their bodies, and some Prophets were more obscure in
<pb facs="tcp:51065:39"/>
their prophesies then others, because their phansy was not so good, nor their imagination so strong as the rest.</p>
            <p>But this kind of Reasoning seems much what like that of the man who speaking of the miracle of Christs feeding five thousand with five Barly-loaves and two fishes, <hi>Joh. 6. 10.</hi> gave this account of it, that what they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in meat, they made up with grass, because it is there occasionally said, <hi>that there was much grass in the place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Prophesy in the notion of it, may include those two things, <hi>1.</hi> A pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of future contingencies, a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telling, not only the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not only such things, the events whereof depend upon the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and necessary connexion of causes, but such as come to pass by the free de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of Mens wills and though
<pb facs="tcp:51065:40"/>
the proper nature of prophesy doth not consist herein, yet is it a certain cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a true Prophet, where it doth occur, for it is not in the power of any lower principle <hi>certainly</hi> to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel such things.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Prophesy more properly implies the Communication of the Divine Will to men, and that with this particular design, to instruct and inform the world in things of great concernment; for there may be private notices and personal commands convey'd from God to Men, which yet are not sufficient to denominate them Prophets.</p>
            <p>Prophesy in the first sense doth sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the being of God to a Christian, and proves it to an heathen, for there may as strong an Argument be drawn from the punctual predictions of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture contingencies in all the particular Modes and Circumstances of them, to
<pb facs="tcp:51065:40"/>
prove a <hi>Divine Being,</hi> as there may from the regular order and constitution of the universe; for it is as impossible <hi>certainly</hi> to foretel things to come in that very way and method wherein they happen without Divine Revelation, as it would have been for the world to have reduc'd it self into this stately frame by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous concourse of Atoms.</p>
            <p>And as prophesy proves the Being of God, so the being of God proves at least the possibility of prophesy, <hi>si dentur dii, datur divinatio,</hi> says <hi>Cicero,</hi> and the consequence is good and valid; unless with the Epicureans, that granting a God we deny his providence, and the government of the world by him: Prophesy and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation being one great instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which he makes use of herein, and indeed it would have seem'd a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in providence to have created such a Noble Creature as Man, without a way of communicating suitable notices to him,
<pb facs="tcp:51065:41"/>
as the conveniencies or necessities of things might require.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Stoicks</hi> argue in this case, if, say they, there be Gods and yet they do not declare to men future events, then ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do not love men, or they know not themselves what will come to pass hereafter, or they think it nothing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns men to know, or they think it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistent with their Majesty to do it, or lastly they know not how to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this their knowledge to others: but all these consequences are false, therefore the Being of God proves such a kind of prophesy or divination. This argumenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theirs refers to prophesy in the first sense, but it would be more strong and undeniable if from thence we infer'd the being of prophesy in the latter; that is, the Revelation of things much more consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable then the meer knowledge of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture events; for he that denies prophesy in this sense, must either grant all those false
<pb facs="tcp:51065:41"/>
and unworthy consequences before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, or some of these, which are as false as the other, either first that God hath declar'd his whole Will by the Light of Nature, so that nothing more remains further to be reveal'd; or Secondly, that nature hath declar'd enough, and that there is no need of any more; or Thirdly, that it is inconsistent with the free de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Divine Will to make any further Revelation, then what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath already discover'd.</p>
            <p>But now this kind of Prophesy or Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation was both necessary in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of man, and no ways contrary to any resolution of the Divine Will, 1. It was necessary, because all the several Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that ever appear'd in the world, either really had, or at least pretended to Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Revelation, now things being in this posture at our Saviours appearance in the world, it was necessary that his Religion should have the truth of that which many
<pb facs="tcp:51065:42"/>
of the others only pretended to, both to free Christians from the danger of being se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by the false pretenses of others, and also fully to assure them of the truth of their own Religion.</p>
            <p>Not though as if the false Oracles of the Heathens did first occasion that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation that was truly Divine, for this had always a precedency in nature to that which was false and counterfeit; thus God first gave the command to <hi>Adam</hi> not to eat of the forbidden fruit, before the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ever tempted him thereunto.</p>
            <p>And the reason of that resemblance, which we sometimes find betwixt Sacred and prophane Rites, is not, that God took occasion from them to institute the like a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst his own people; but because the Devil, being Gods Ape, doth many times either pervert Divine Institutions to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious or Idolatrous purposes, or erect something of the like nature of his own to keep some in the belief and practise
<pb facs="tcp:51065:42"/>
of the false Religion, and to seduce others from the true one, so that it is no ways inconsistent with the subtilty or malice of the Devil, but rather highly promotive of both, to borrow some Divine Rites and Sacred Institutions and insert them into his own Worship.</p>
            <p>And it seems more probable, that the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians</hi> here borrowed from the <hi>Jews,</hi> then the <hi>Jews</hi> from the <hi>Egyptians</hi>; for notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the great hatred which they bore to the <hi>Jews,</hi> yet they might imitate them in some part of their Religious Worship, and that not out of any love they had either to them or their Religion, but that they might the better secure some of their own people in their Idolatrous Worship, who perhaps had entertain'd too great an opinion of some of the Jewish Ceremonies, or that by this means they might some other ways more effectually manage their malice against them; but what ever was the first occasion or original of the Devils Oracles, yet this is certain, that at Christs appearance in the world, they had very much prevail'd in the Heathen Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and therefore it was necessary that
<pb facs="tcp:51065:43"/>
Christ should both silence these, and insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a more certain method of Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of his own.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> Revelation was necessary to assure the world of Gods reconciliation to mankind, and upon what terms and by what methods we may attain Salvation: for though the Divine Goodness be as knowable by the Light of Nature, and as easily apparent in the notion of a Deity, as any other of it's attributes of Power and Iustice; yet being conscious to our selves of daily offending God; and guilt being naturally full of Iea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousie; We could not be so fully assur'd of Gods mercy without such a Revelation, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving forfeited the effects thereof, as to our selves, and however though we might have some notions of Gods parability and willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to pardon, yet we could scarce have imagin'd that his mercy would have extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thus far, not only to pardon our sins, but also to confer upon us such a degree of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness.</p>
            <p>Nor doth their way of reasoning seem co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent and necessary, who tell us that Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reason leads us to a Mediator, and that such an one, as God indeed has appointed to be God and Man: God, say they, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb facs="tcp:51065:43"/>
just and perfectly merciful, and being just he must condemn all mankind, because sinful, but this would be repugnant to his mercy, which must also be perfect with effect, now seeing the perfection of these two at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes of justice and mercy may consist in God together, and since this cannot be, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less God doth satisfie, and Man do suffer, therefore Reason dictates such a Mediator, as is both God and Man.</p>
            <p>But this is a <hi>Post-nate</hi> way of arguing, found out since Gods Revelation of his Will in this matter, for where did ever appear any such way of reasoning amongst the Heathen Philosophers, or any others, before Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of it; so that all that can follow hence, is only an agreeableness of the Divine Methods of Salvation, here made use of, to Reason, not any ability in Reason to prove that the things ought to be so, Antecedent to the Revelation.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> This Argument doth suppose or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to prove the Incarnation of Christ, knowable by the Light of Nature, which is so far from being true, that it is not fully and clearly conceiveable how it could be done, even now when it is reveal'd; there are indeed some instances in nature which
<pb facs="tcp:51065:44"/>
seem to facilitate the belief of the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thus what is man, but as it were a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Essay to the Incarnation? being com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of Principles as far distant as Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, of Soul and Body: but then this is only an illustration of a truth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready reveal'd, not any Antecedent Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove it.</p>
            <p>I might easily enlarge further on this subject, but I am very sensible that I have already transgress'd the due limits of a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face: the ensuing Treatise will be a suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient demonstration of the other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, <hi>viz.</hi> That Divine Revelation is no ways contrary to the free determination of the Divine Will, it being that which God hath promis'd in general, and particularly by this way of <hi>Dreams and Visions.</hi>

               <p> Doubt not but you remember the conference we had, as we went to Councellor <hi>Amproux</hi> his lodgings: one of our Discourses was concerning the Nature of those Dreams which God sometimes sent unto his Servants, and particularly concerning the marks and characters, by which they might know them to be truly Divine. For as much as you found a great deal of difficulty in that matter, I should have been glad if we had discours'd
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:51065:45"/>
further upon it. But the night came on, and obliged you to retire to your lodgings; and <hi>Madamoiselle de la Suze,</hi> who staid for me in another place, and I went also to ours, we had some discourse in our return concerning it, and she desir'd me (according to my ability) to illustrate and explain what did seem more obscure and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult in that subject, which she thought worthy of a more attentive consideration. I bestow'd some thoughts upon it in my journey, and if other affairs had not prevented me, I had e're this committed them to Paper: But if my occasions, which are at present so urgent, and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate do permit, I will do it: and I here begin this little work in midst of their disturbance, on purpose to engage my self to a necessity of fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishing it, that so I may send it as a testimony of that respect which I bear you, and of that singular esteem which I have of your rare qualities, and of the Honour of your Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of natural Dreams and their several Causes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere are three kinds of facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in man, which are sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servient to him, both in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring and preserving knowledge, <hi>viz.</hi> the External Senses, which are as it were, at the one extream; the Understanding at the other; and the Internal Senses in the middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt these two. The impression of external objects made upon the Corporeal senses is not call'd by the name of Dreams, seeing it is made upon us waking; neither are the ratiocinations of the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing call'd Dreams, because Dreams are form'd in some of those faculties, which are common to us with beasts, to whom also, as to dogs and horses belongs the power of dreaming: so that it necessarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:51065:46"/>
that that impression, wherein the nature of dreams doth consist, must be made in the internal senses. Now these are commonly accounted three, the <hi>Common Sense,</hi> the <hi>Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tasie,</hi> and the <hi>Memory</hi>: all which three, some do think to be but one and the same faculty, but diversly considered according to its divers modes of acting upon its respective objects: others do distinguish them as different faculties <hi>in themselves,</hi> and not only in their operations. I I shall here follow this latter opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both as more universally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, and more fit and proper for the explication of that which I here undertake, and shall assert, that dreams are not made in the <hi>common sense</hi> or <hi>sensus communis,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that doth not act, but when the external senses are awake: nor to speak properly, are they made in the <hi>memory,</hi> because the <hi>Idea's</hi> of things there are only in <hi>Potentiâ,</hi> and when they are reduc'd into <hi>Act,</hi> do then pass into the imagination or
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:51065:46"/>
phansie. But the images whereof dreams are form'd, are in <hi>Act,</hi> as we say, and therefore must necessarily be in that part which we call the <hi>Phansie</hi>; to which all the world do more generally agree. That impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion then (which is the cause of dreams) must be refer'd to one of these three causes, <hi>Nature, Angels</hi> or <hi>God</hi>; and accordingly there can be but three kinds of dreams, <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>supernatural</hi>; and these, such as proceed either from the operation of <hi>Angels,</hi> or such as are more purely <hi>Divine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for natural dreams, they may be divided into four Classes, (1.) there are some which are to be imputed to the mere temperament of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or to the Constitution wherein the person that dreams, chances to be, when he has such or such visions. For Example, those who are of an hot or Cholerick constitution, or at that time have their Stomachs over-charged with Choler, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly dream of fire; those who
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:51065:47"/>
are naturally Phlegmatick, or who then chance to abound with Phlegm, do dream of ponds and rivers, and inundation of waters: and it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably the same with others, according to the diversity of their constitutions. And although expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience shews this to be true, and that Physicians do take indications from dreams, whereby to judge of the temperature of the body, yet the reason, why it is so, doth not so easily appear. I shall briefly offer something, as a reason hereof, as I pass along, though my design doth not at all oblige me hereunto: it is this, I think we may truly assert that the operations of our <hi>outward senses</hi> do convey into our memory the <hi>Idea's</hi> of all sensible things, which are there preserv'd upon all occasions; and that it is from thence that the subject matter of natural dreams is taken. For if we could imagine a man to have liv'd to the age of twenty five years without any use of his <hi>senses,</hi> we must also
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:51065:47"/>
imagine him to have liv'd so long without ever dreaming, in as much as he had not the Idea of any sensible thing in his memory; since also it is certain that in sleep the natural heat is more intense in the inward parts, as the liver, the heart, the diaphragm, and in all those parts that surround the Stomach: Hence it causes vapors to arise into the brain, which on the one hand are hot by the heat they draw from their cause, that rais'd them; and on the other hand retain something of that humour, which is more universally predominant in the temperature of the body, or more particularly in the stomach, whether it be <hi>Choler,</hi> or <hi>Phlegm,</hi> or <hi>Blood,</hi> or <hi>Melancholy,</hi> which are the four usually here ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into consideration; according therefore to the heat of these va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pors, so they put the <hi>Idea's</hi> in the memory into motion, and reduce them into <hi>Act</hi> in the imagination; and as they retain something of such or such an humor, so they affect the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:51065:48"/>
brain, &amp; particularly that part which is the seat of the <hi>phansie,</hi> with the quality of that humor from which they proceed. Now that which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth the effect, is, that the organ being thus affected, doth better re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the images of those things which do suit with its present con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, and doth better retain them; whereas those others which do not at all agree therewith are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spersed and fly away: so that if these vapors do arise from a Phlegmatick humour, then the <hi>phansie</hi> is apt to represent to it self waters and inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, if from <hi>Bile</hi> and Choler, then fire and burnings; and those other forms of things of a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nature, which the heat had rais'd and drawn from the memory into the <hi>imagination,</hi> slip away and make no abode there. But however it be, that we decide this question, the dreams that proceed from such a cause, can have no other power of signification. but only from the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to give some knowledge of the
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:51065:48"/>
cause: The reason hereof is this, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause that which produceth them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing altogether void of all under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing (for neither the heat, that is in the inward parts, hath any; nor the memory, nor the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and as for the understanding, it is not at all concern'd herein) therefore these cannot be design'd to any particular end.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But there are others (which is the second kind of dreams) where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the temperament, and the dispo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition of humours have no place, and these proceed from no other cause then the heat, which arising from the lower parts to the brain, doth put the <hi>Idea's</hi> and images of things in the memory into motion, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presents them to the <hi>phansie,</hi> but in a confus'd and disturb'd manner, in proportion to the greatness of the heat, and according as the vapors, which arise from the stomach are gross or subtle, and as they are more or less abundant, and so accordingly fill the vessels of the brain; for
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:51065:49"/>
when they are gross and in great plenty, the images of things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call'd from the memory, are there so swallowed up, that either it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents none to the <hi>fansie,</hi> that it can take any notice of, which is the cause that we then dream not at all; or if it do, yet it is attended with so much weakness and obscurity, that when we awake, we remember no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what we dream'd; and hence it is, that some, though very few, never dream at all; because the vapors that arise in their sleep, are always thick and darksome; and hence also it is, that ordinarily we do not dream immediately after meals, for as much as the stomach being then full, doth send up to the brain vapours in too great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; but if the vapours be more thin and subtle, if they be in less abundance and more calm, then the images of things do present them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to the phansie with more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction, and yet not without a great deal of disorder, for let us
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:51065:49"/>
suppose the images of themselves or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly plac'd in the memory, yet there are two things that may cause confusion; the one, that the heat that moves them, doth also disturb them, as we see small pieces of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a vessel full of water, remain each in its proper place, so long as the water is calm and unmov'd: but if you put fire under it, the water by boiling is put into motion, and the several substances are jumbled together by its agitation: the other, that while the external senses are awake and in action, they govern and fix the phansie by their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but when they are laid asleep and the phansie thus more at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there is a great deal of irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in all its actions; from hence it comes, that the images, (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the memory, agitated by the heat, hath fill'd the phansie) do joyn themselves one to another fortui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tously and without order, from whence is form'd an infinite number of phantastical and extravagant
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:51065:50"/>
compositions: we see the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence hereof in a feaver, when the violence of the heat and the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick vapours do disturb the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; and we see it also in <hi>fools,</hi> who though they neither sleep nor are in a feaver, yet have their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination disturb'd by reason of the distemper of their brain; which makes them conceive so many Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maera's and utter such strange in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>consistencies, and divers kinds of things, which have no natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion among themselves, passing into the phansie and joyning them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves one to another with a great deal of irregularity; for the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is a faculty, which of it self is able to receive the impression of those <hi>Idea's,</hi> and also joyn them to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; but because it is corporeal and by consequent void of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, it can neither perceive their agreement nor their disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor conveniently dispose of them according to reason: So that it acts here, as a blind man would do,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:51065:50"/>
who being among a great number of broken and mutilated statues, should go about rightly to reassem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble their parts by groping: for it would frequently happen without doubt, that he would, for example, set <hi>Marius</hi> his head upon <hi>Cleopatra's</hi> body, and put the thighs of a Brasen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horse under the trunk of <hi>Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And these dreams have yet less power of signifying things to come, then the former; for as much as the composition of the images is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fortuitous, and by consequent incapable either to represent any thing, as in an allegorical Emblem, or nakedly and without any such re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation to foretel it; for eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Emblem and Symbolical repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation is the work of an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent agent, and the foreseeing things to come requires still more light of reason. 'Tis true indeed, that the understanding sometimes makes some reflexions upon the things thus presented to the phansie
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:51065:51"/>
in sleep; for there is this difference betwixt our dreams, and those of Dogs and Horses: those of such ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals do not reach any higher facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, then the imagination, for as much as they have none higher, whereas ours do sometimes affect the understanding; so that we do some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times make rational reflexions upon those phantasms, and sometimes long discourses, as it frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to those who are accustomed to speak in publick. But then in the first place, it is not the understanding that forms these <hi>Idea's,</hi> it only acts upon them, as they are represented by the imagination, so that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give them the least power of sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying things to come; and further how can that which cannot foresee things future, when awake, do it when asleep, and be able to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent them in those different shapes which then concur in the fansie? so far is it from doing any thing of this, that it cannot pass any rational judgment either of the past or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:51065:51"/>
of which yet it hath much more knowledge then of things to come, and indeed no extravagance is able then to check or set bounds to our understanding; we raise our friends whom we know to be dead, and discourse with them, as if yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, we set <hi>Paris</hi> in <hi>Quercy</hi> and <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and this without any great wonder to us, we become Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars and Kings in a moment, nor doth this so strange an alteration any ways amuse us, and there is nothing so phantastical or disagreeable, which doth not thus seem reasonable to us.</p>
               <p n="3">3. The third sort of natural dreams are such as proceed from those employments of our life, to which we apply our selves with great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of mind; for studious men dream of books, covetous men of money, Souldiers imagine they see battalions of foot and squadrons of horse, and generally those who are delighted in any employment dream of things relating thereunto: And
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:51065:52"/>
it is not difficult to render a reason hereof, for the images of these things are most familiar to them, and do most frequently occur; so that it is no wonder, if when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heat, which is much more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense in sleep, doth move and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate this store-house of sensible <hi>Idea's</hi>; no wonder, I say, if these do first and more frequently offer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, but yet always, almost with the same phantasticalness, as the former, so that we may make the same judgment of both, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they have no more power to signifie things to come, then they had.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The fourth kind of natural dreams is that which arises upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of some passion which has ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther possess'd us, whilst yet waking, and upon which we now reflect be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asleep, or such as takes its first rise in our sleep by the motion of the irascible or concupiscible appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite; and here it fares with us al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most in the same manner as in those,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:51065:52"/>
which proceed from the tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the body and the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the humours, for thus it presents to our imagination objects, which leave some resemblance to our passions. Those who are hungry imagine they see feasts, and those who are thirsty believe they drink at fountains. The amorous see their inclinations; and the cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerick the objects of their anger, and run to meet their enemies, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent themselves in arms before them. But as these dreams have without doubt a cause antecedent in your passion, so it is certain that ordinarily they are no less extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, then the former, nor more capable to give any certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of things to come, nor of those very things which already exist, if they be altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us before our dream; for the sensitive part of our soul is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed able to submit to reason, but in it self doth no ways partake of it: so that it being in its own nature
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:51065:53"/>
irrational, it is impossible it should produce any thing, which as we said before, requires an intelligent agent for its cause. 'Tis true, sometimes it happens that some of these dreams do come to pass, which makes us think, there is some resemblance or agreement betwixt the dream and the event, and by consequence, that some Angel or Spirit is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd therein: But as <hi>Aristotle</hi> has observ'd, this happens by meer chance, as he that without any aim should shoot a thousand arrows, may at last by chance hit the mark: so in our dreams such an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of visions do pass into our ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, that it is not only no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, if one should sometimes chance to be true, but it would be much more strange if once or twice in our life it did not so happen; but if any of our dreams do not only come to pass, but there also be a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able agreement betwixt it and the event, and such as that we ought necessarily to suppose the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:51065:53"/>
of an intelligent agent to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene, we ought not then to reckon this among natural dreams, but to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer it either to God or to some action of Angels.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Angelical Dreams in General, and some rational reflexions on particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ones.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere are two sorts of dreams which we may impute to cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated Intelligences, the one where the things signifi'd are contained in Symbolical and Mysterious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations; the other where they are propos'd naked without any such resemblances; as for the first, those who undertake to give rules of their interpretation, do it in two different ways, for they tell us that we ought sometimes to take the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contrary to the dream for it's interpretation: as if one dream of
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:51065:54"/>
marriages, they say, it is a sign of death; and on the contrary, if we imagine in our sleep that we see Mourning-weeds and Funeral-attire, we shall then suddenly hear of a Marriage; but one may dream of such things without Angels any ways concerning themselves here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, for that the images of those things may remain in the memory, and by the meer force of nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into the Phansie, when we are asleep; but when any such dream shall happen and it be imprinted in the imagination by the operation of an Angel, we may assure our selves that it is not a good one that doth it, for they are the <hi>Ministers of God,</hi> who is never that Author of those dreams, whose signification is thus to be read backward, much less hath he established any such rule to interpret them by, and there is not the least footstep hereof either in Scripture or Nature, and there is too much of uncertainty in these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations to entitle them to
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:51065:54"/>
Divine Revelation. And this makes me call to mind that which they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of <hi>Buchanan,</hi> who every year inter-leaf'd his <hi>Almanack</hi> with white paper, and where the <hi>Almanack</hi> fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told <hi>Fair-weather,</hi> he writ over against it <hi>Fowl,</hi> and where it said it should be <hi>Rain</hi> or <hi>Cloudy,</hi> he set op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite to it, a <hi>Fair</hi> and <hi>Clear Skie,</hi> and that after he had observ'd it fifty or sixty years, he said, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways came nearer the truth, then the <hi>Almanack,</hi> but hence it follows not, that those who made <hi>Alma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacks,</hi> did design by the contrary predictions those events, which <hi>Buchanan</hi> did thus prognostick, but that the <hi>Astrologers</hi> making for the most part their Prognostications at an adventure, and some of them not having the least knowledge of the stars, it might very well happen that <hi>Buchanan,</hi> thus by chance might foretel fair or foul weather, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king always the contrary to their Predictions.</p>
               <p>But the more common rule of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:51065:55"/>
of dreams is to observe the agreement and resemblances which are betwixt the dreams and their events; thus they tell us, that he that dreams he hath lost a tooth, shall loose a friend, and he that dreams that a rib is taken out of his side, shall ere long see the death of his wife. I shall not here stay to relate examples of this nature, which have been verifi'd by the event. <hi>Cicero</hi> among others relates this, a certain man dream'd that there was an <hi>Egg</hi> hid under his bed, the Sooth-sayer to whom he apply'd himself for the interpretation of the dream, told him that in the same place where he imagin'd to see the <hi>Egg,</hi> there was treasure hid: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he caus'd the place to be dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged up, and there accordingly he found Silver, and in the midst of it a good quantity of Gold, and to give the interpreter some testimony of his acknowledgement, he brought him some pieces of the Silver, which he had found; but the Sooth-sayer
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:51065:55"/>
hoping also to have some of the Gold, said, <hi>and will you not give me some of the yolk too?</hi> Now these dreams, which we cannot reasonably impute either to natural causes, or to meer chance, yet do they not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the power of Angels to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey; for an Angel either good or bad (for I shall not now examine the question, which of the two it is) I say, it is not impossible for an Angel to know that there was trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure hid there. An Angel might also imprint such a dream upon the mans imagination, whilst he was asleep, and also reveal to the Sooth-sayer, that the <hi>Egg</hi> did signifie a treasure, where there was Gold and Silver hid, or might furnish him with occasions to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture so.</p>
               <p>There are also some of this nature, which respect the future, which may proceed from the operation of Angels. The Poets say that <hi>Hecuba,</hi> the wife of <hi>Priamus</hi> being with child of <hi>Paris,</hi> dream'd that she brought
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:51065:56"/>
forth a burning torch; upon occasion whereof the Soothsayers did presage, that the Child should be the cause of the ruine of <hi>Troy</hi> and of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration. The Ancient Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans tell us, that the Mother of <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laris</hi> dream'd that among the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which she consecrated in the house of her Son, she saw that of <hi>Mercury,</hi> who from a bowl, that he had in his hand, pour'd out blood upon the Earth, which boil'd out in so great plenty, that it overflow'd the whole house, which was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted and confirm'd by the cruelties of <hi>Phalaris</hi> the most bloody man up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth. <hi>Cyrus</hi> in a dream fansi'd he saw the Sun at his feet, and that he thrice attempted to catch it in his hand, but that it always rowling away escap'd him: which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians thus interpreted; his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt thrice to catch the Sun si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnify'd that he should reign thirty years, which the event confirmed. These dreams, I say, may proceed from the operation of Angels, for as
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:51065:56"/>
much as the impression of these images in the fansie is not above the Sphere of that Activity; the <hi>Idea</hi> of the Sun is in all mens memorys; and that of burning torches, of Statues and of blood; so that there was nothing wanting in these occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions but to reduce them into the fansie, and there to put them into a due place and motion.</p>
               <p>And as for the prevision of things to come, which Angels would signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie hereby, this they can do partly of themselves and their own proper Conjectures, partly by a certain kind of revelation from God. The Devil who seeks all opportunities of doing mischief to the world, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd to promote and carry on the barbarous humour of <hi>Phalaris</hi> to all manner of cruelties, and seeing the house of <hi>Priamus</hi> flourishing and his state great and potent, he propounded to himself to do all he possibly could to ruine it, and to that purpose to make use of all occasions that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented themselves, and to make
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:51065:57"/>
                  <hi>Priamus</hi> his very children instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental thereunto. And although these were but meer designs, of the event whereof, he could have no certainty, for as much as the will of God and his providence super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intends all things, yet he doth not forbear to hope, and to foretel the manner of that thing which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self designs to do, which God, for reasons best known to himself, would not hinder the ratification of by the event. As for that of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> it was impossible for Angels to Divine how long he should reign, but God suffers sometimes some of his more secret Counsels to appear to the view of created intelligences, and from these radiations which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the Cabinet of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Counsels, they either certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foresee some things to come, or at least form such reasonings and conjectures as come very near the truth.</p>
               <p>Those other dreams which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose things nakedly, as they are in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:51065:57"/>
themselves have no need of an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter to understand them, but when the event confirms them, they are not therefore the less wonderful. I shall produce two or three exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which seem very remarkable. Two <hi>Arcadian</hi> friends travel'd toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and lay one night in the City <hi>Megara,</hi> where the one lodged in a publique Inn, the other in a private friends house, as was usual in those days. After Supper, he in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate house being gone to bed, and asleep, the other appear'd to him in a dream, and prayed him to come to his assistance, for as much as the Master of the Inn design'd to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther him: the affright of the dream having wakened him, he rose up, but being come to himself he took it for a meer dream and idle vision, and went to sleep again. In his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond sleep, the image of his friend came again into his phansie, and he imagin'd that he pray'd him, that since he would not help him whilst living, yet at least he would not let
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:51065:58"/>
his death go unpunish'd: for that the Master of the house had murther'd him and had cast his body into a Cart full of dung, and desir'd him to go early in the Morning to the Gate of the City before the Cart went out, the man being very much mov'd by his dream rose up, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that Gate, there stop'd the Cart loaden with dung ready to pass, whereupon the Carter being frighted fled away, and the body being there found, the crime was by this means discover'd, the Host punish'd, and all the City struck with admiration at the wonderfulness of the dream.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cicero</hi> relates this in the book al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready cited: See also another taken out of the life of <hi>Monsieur Peiresc,</hi> Councellor of the Parliament of <hi>Provence.</hi> This excellent Personage going from <hi>Montpellier</hi> to <hi>Nismes</hi> lay all night in an Inn, which is the Mid-way betwixt those two places; he had in his company one <hi>Iames Rainier,</hi> Citizen of <hi>Aix,</hi> who in
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:51065:58"/>
that journey lodged in the same Chamber with him: as that great man slept, <hi>Rainier</hi> observ'd that he talk'd and mutter'd something in his sleep, otherwise then was usual with him, whereupon he wakened him, and ask'd him what was the matter; Oh! said he, you have made me lose a most excellent and pleasant dream; for I was dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I was at <hi>Nismes,</hi> and that a Goldsmith shew'd me a golden Medal of <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> which he would sell me for four Crowns, and as I was ready to give him them, both my Goldsmith and my Medal vanish'd away together by your awakening of me. Being arriv'd at <hi>Nismes</hi> and having not forgot his dream, he went to walk in the City, till such time as dinner was ready, and passing up and down he went in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Goldsmiths shop, to ask him whether he had any rarity to show him, whereupon the Goldsmith an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer'd that he had a <hi>Iulius Caesar</hi> of Gold; <hi>Monsieur de Peiresc</hi> asking the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:51065:59"/>
price of it, he answer'd, four Crowns, which thing did fill the mind of that great person, both with joy and admiration, as well for that he had found a Rarity, which he had long very much sought for; As also for the surprising, and strange manner whereby it came to his hands.</p>
               <p>A third shall be another out of the same book of <hi>Cicero. Hannibal</hi> having taken <hi>Sagunta,</hi> dream'd that <hi>Iupiter</hi> call'd him to a Council of the Gods, where <hi>Iupiter</hi> commanded him to carry the war into <hi>Italy,</hi> and that one of that Assembly should march in the head of his Army, and having begun his March under the Conduct of him, who was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be his guide, the guide forbad him to look behind him, but he could not prevail so far with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, being transported with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to know what that was, which came behind him, where he saw a great and terrible beast all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pass'd with Serpents, which did
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:51065:59"/>
wind themselves about it, and where ere it pass'd, it turn'd all up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side down, houses and trees, and shrubs, and generally all that ever came in its way: being astonish'd at the sight, he demanded of the god that conducted him, what that Monster signify'd, whereupon he told him that was the ruine and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solation of <hi>Italy,</hi> but as for the rest, that he should not trouble him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self with what should come after, but march on without losing of time.</p>
               <p>This last dream did certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from some evil Angel, for a good one would never have sent into his imagination the <hi>Idea</hi> of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of false gods. But an evil one made use of the Images of the false Deities, which their Statues, had left in the Memory of this Heathen Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and joyn'd other things neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary thereunto for the perfect consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the dream. As for what was foretold of the desolation of <hi>Italy,</hi> it was easie for an evil Angel
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:51065:60"/>
to Divine, <hi>viz.</hi> That if this <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginian</hi> Captain did follow the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel given him, and enter into <hi>Italy</hi> with a Splendid and Victorious Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, that he would there make very great Desolations. And if the event was answerable and exceeded even what the Devil was able to conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, it therefore so happen'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God had so ordain'd it in the Counsel of his Providence. The first of these Examples, as it is recited by <hi>Cicero,</hi> may be refer'd to good or bad Angels, (1.) To bad ones, as they had a great Empire among the Heathens, and having had a great part in the design of him who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Murther, they then by the discovery drew two Signal Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages: the one, that after they had caus'd an innocent man to be slain, they then caus'd also the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to die, this being a great pleasure to the enemy of mankind, whose destruction he delights in, and if he were permitted, he would unpeople the whole earth. The other, that
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:51065:60"/>
hereby they gave some Credit and Authority to Dreams of this nature, which passing for Extraordinary and Divine, did further confirm some men in the respect they bare those Deities, to which they were attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It may also be attributed to good ones, for as much as, although, God hath left the Heathen Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in a great measure to walk in their own ways, yet notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he has not cast off all care of them in respect of his Universal Providence, of which the Angels are his Instruments, and the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of his Will and Pleasure. And although for good reasons he might suffer the poor <hi>Arcadian</hi> to be slain, it was yet an effect of his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to punish the Murtherer: for this is one great means, by which he preserves Humane Societies, for the subsistence whereof God always takes a particular care. As for the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, I should without any great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty attribute it to a good Angel,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:51065:61"/>
who would thus testifie, that though they be invisible, yet they do not only converse here below with men, but also that they have a kindness for great Persons, who are lovers of Learning and Vertue; for to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute this Dream to meer chance, I think it can no more reasonably be done, then to those natural causes, of which I spoke before. The Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of <hi>Peiresc</hi> his life, has indeed reason to say, that considering all the parts of that Story separately, there is not any one singly that seems to be very wonderful. The City of <hi>Nismes,</hi> saith he, might come into the Imagination of this great man, as he slept, seeing he had a Design to go thither, and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most arriv'd at it: he might also dream of <hi>Iulius Caesar's</hi> Medal, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very curious of those Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; Although the Medals of that kind were very rare, yet it was no strange thing to meet with one there, seeing that <hi>Nismes</hi> was a City which had been very much fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:51065:61"/>
by the <hi>Romans.</hi> It was more probable to find one in the hands of a Goldsmith, then elsewhere, for they into whose hands such pieces of Antiquity do sometimes come, do often desire rather Currant Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and find better opportunities of putting them off at Goldsmiths, then elsewhere. It might easily come to pass, both that <hi>Peiresc</hi> should dream that he bought it for so reasonable a price, and that a Goldsmith should be content with four Crowns for a piece, which those that are curious would without any difficulty buy at a far greater rate. But that so many circumstances should meet together in one and the same Dream, and that they should all exactly answer the particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the event, is that which far surpasses both the accidental hits of meer chance, and all natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, so that we must necessari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attribute it to some intelligent cause.</p>
               <p>And every one may see that this
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:51065:62"/>
is no ways above the power of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; they then certainly knowing that at <hi>Nismes,</hi> in the hands of a Goldsmith, there was a <hi>Iulius Caesar,</hi> which they had seen and heard va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued at four Crowns, they might hereupon go and make this impressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Imagination of this great Person. However I do not see in this Dream any the least Character, which doth necessarily oblige us to refer it to evil Angels: no more then (briefly to mention it) that of <hi>Calpurnia,</hi> the wife of <hi>Caesar,</hi> who the night immediately before the death of her husband, dream'd that she saw one run him through with a Sword in the Senate: though the relation which she made, and the prayers by which she endeavour'd to divert him from the Senate that day, prov'd all ineffectual: but good Angels may give us good advertise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though we do not follow their advice, and this is a testimony of the care they have for the conser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the life of Princes; as

the neglect thereof is a proof of the imprudence of those who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd therein. It is not related to us in Scripture, what was the dream of <hi>Pilate's</hi> wife, when she sent to pray him not to have any thing to do in the death of our Lord Christ: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it was, it seems to have come from the impression of a good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, though <hi>Pilate</hi> did not submit thereunto: However it was suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the Angel in this case, to have caus'd his wife thus to give te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony to the Innocence of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; However, I say, it was (for I would not make it an Article of Faith) and every one here may use the liberty of his own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; perhaps this was done to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish betwixt those Dreams which Angels cause in our Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the express Command of God, and those which proceed from their operation by bare permission: those ought to be more powerful and efficacious, for as much as they are intended for the execution of
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:51065:63"/>
some Design, which God hath pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed with himself, and therefore 'tis necessary that he so far di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spose the understanding of those, whom these visions concern, that they defer so much to them, as is necessary to bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Design; but these co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming only from the good Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Angels, which God suffers them to follow and to discover on such and such occasions, it is of no great importance, though they do not produce the effect, which their Authors design'd; and it is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent satisfaction to them, that they have shown that good will, which they have for men, and especially for those who are eminent in vertue or dignity.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Of Divine Dreams.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS for Divine Dreams, they are also of two sorts, the one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains future things under AEnigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical and Mysterious Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the other are much more plain and naked; there are very remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Examples of the first sort in the History of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> as well in those, which concern'd himself, to foretel his own grandeur, as in those of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to forewarn him of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven years of plenty, and seven others of dearth.</p>
               <p>The Image of <hi>Nabuchodonosor</hi> is yet more remarkable, as the stone cut without hands, which from small beginnings came to be a great mountain and fill'd all the World; There are Examples of the other kind in the History of the birth of our Saviour; as well those which
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:51065:64"/>
were sent to the wise men, to warn them to return some other way, then where <hi>Herod</hi> did expect them, as in those by which <hi>Ioseph</hi> was command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to carry Christ into <hi>Egypt,</hi> and to bring him back again in due time. As for <hi>Iacob's</hi> vision which was convey'd to him in a Dream, when he went into <hi>Padan-Aram,</hi> it was compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of both the sorts, for the Ladder upon which the Angels did ascend and descend, had without doubt a mysterious signification, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to Christ, but the words which he heard, contain'd the promises, plain and intelligible, which were not wrap'd up in the vail of dark and mysterious repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations. Now concerning these and all other Divine Dreams in general, we may make these three Enquiries:
<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>Why God hath sometimes reveal'd himself in Dreams to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants?</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="41" facs="tcp:51065:64"/>2. <hi>How they could certainly know, that those Dreams had God for their Author, and that they were not vain delusions?</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. <hi>Whether this way of Revelation by Dreams, be yet practis'd, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God doth still make use of it under the Dispensation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>As for the first of these questions, the Apostle tells us, <hi>That God at di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers times, and in sundry manners spoke of old to the fathers by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, but hath now in these last days spoke unto us by his Son</hi>; where he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses the dispensation of the Son to the former of Law, in three things,
<list>
                     <item>1. That God formerly spoke to the Fathers by the Prophets, but hath now spoke to us by his Son.</item>
                     <item>2. This he did at divers times, that is, he reveal'd the knowledge of himself by degrees, and as it were by parcels, adding one light
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:51065:65"/>
to another successively, whereas he has now reveal'd to us all at once so much of his truth, as he design'd us to know even to the end of the world.</item>
                     <item>3. He now only reveals himself in one way, <hi>viz.</hi> By the preaching of the Gospel, whereas then he did it in divers manners.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>And these divers manners may refer to those several kinds of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which, as I said before, we make use of for the getting and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving of knowledge, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Senses,</hi> the <hi>Internal,</hi> and the <hi>Vnderstanding.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the External, God makes little use of three of them for this end, <hi>viz.</hi> Touching, Smelling and Tasting, but doth frequently em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy the other two: for he hath been presented visibly to our eyes, as well in humane appearance, as to <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Manoe</hi> and to some others, as in other shapes, as to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> in the burning Bush: And as for hearing, he hath often caus'd voices
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:51065:65"/>
to be heard from heaven, as by <hi>Abraham,</hi> and also by <hi>Moses,</hi> in the Bush, and in many other instances. As for the Internal Senses, he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys them both waking and sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Waking, by Extasies which he hath sometimes sent to his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants: for then he acted in such manner upon their Imagination by that Power and Vertue which he there display'd, and made so great and so powerful an abstraction of their souls from their External Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, that their functions did altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cease, though they were not then asleep: and yet in the mean time he Imprinted in their phansie the Images of Extraordinary and Admirable things, and made them inwardly to understand the voice, which gave them, either some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction or Command:</p>
               <p>We see a famous Example hereof in S. <hi>Peter,</hi> when he saw the sheet descending from heaven, and heard the voice, <hi>Kill and eat,</hi> for he was
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:51065:66"/>
then in an Extasie or Trance, and the things which S. <hi>Iohn</hi> relates to us in his <hi>Revelation,</hi> were thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd to him.</p>
               <p n="2">2. In sleep, by dreams, such as I have already mention'd, and others of the like nature; and there is little difference betwixt Extasies and Dreams, only that, though in both there was a Cessation of the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the bodily senses, yet in an Extasie, it was not altogether so entire and absolute, as in sleep, nor did it proceed from the same cause; for in sleep this cessation proceeded from natural causes, from whence it usually comes; but in an Extasie, it was caus'd by the extraordinary and miraculous power of the Spirit of God, which drew a way the Souls of his Servants from the Organs of their External Senses, and hinder'd it from displaying its power and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy.</p>
               <p>As to the understanding, the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in this case acted in these two ways upon it.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:51065:66"/>1. That, whereas ordinarily the knowledge which we have in the understanding, enters by the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of the senses, which conveys the Images of sensible things, and by these sensible objects furnishes us with the occasions of ratiocination; yet here God did immediately im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print in the spirit of his Prophets the understanding of those things, which he would reveal to them, thus making them to understand without the help of ratiocination: and he reveal'd many things thus to <hi>Moses</hi> and others.</item>
                  <item>2. That whereas we are not or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily induc'd to great actions, but after an attentive consultation upon the end, which we propound to our selves, upon the motives that induce us, and upon the means by which we may attain them, God did sometimes inspire his servants with miraculous and heroick motions, by which they were carried to extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary things without such a deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration, only, because they were
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:51065:67"/>
inwardly sensible to themselves, that it was God that thus excited them, such was that of <hi>Ehud</hi> when he kill'd <hi>Eglon,</hi> King of <hi>Moab</hi>; such was that of <hi>Phineas</hi> when he slew the <hi>Israelite</hi> and the <hi>Madianite</hi> at one blow; such that of <hi>David</hi> when he resolv'd to fight <hi>Goliah</hi> with a sling; and if there were any other ways, which God sometimes made use of to reveal himself by, under the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal dispensation, as the voice that was heard in the Tabernacle, and the lights of <hi>Vrim</hi> and <hi>Thummim,</hi> they may be referr'd some way to that which I now come briefly to speak unto, and my design doth not oblige me to enlarge my discourse further upon this matter.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I shall only shew in general, why God made use of all these divers ways, and particularly, why this of dreams. For the first, we must know, that the Church, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, was then in its infancy, and there is a great deal of differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence betwixt the way whereby we
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:51065:67"/>
instruct Infants, and that by which we teach Arts and Sciences, to those who are of riper years; To these we only make use of words, or if there be occasion, to make Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strations to the eye, we only make them in lines and Mathematical Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures, or at the most content our selves to propose to view the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and the experiments of sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble things, as those of the <hi>Vacuum</hi> or the <hi>Loadstone</hi>; and all this doth only give occasion to the understanding, to form its own reasonings; but as for Infants, for as much as their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of reason is yet weak and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect, we make use of Medals, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems, Representations, Hierogly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phicks and other such like Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, so that we have of late years seen painted Chards, full of Emble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Figures, whereby to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print the Rules of Logick in the minds of the younger sort by play, and the reason hereof is, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that men have no need of those helps to make them understand these
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:51065:68"/>
Sciences, the Maxims and Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rems whereof they easily conceive at their first proposal, they also have no need of those allurements to invite them to learn, for as much as the beauty of the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves is a sufficient invitation here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: whereas children have both need to be taught for Example, by the Figure of an Ox, what is meant by a <hi>Real or Substantial Being,</hi> as we see in some Philosophical tables, as also they must be entic'd by these pretty devices, for the difficulty of the things would discourage them, if we went about otherwise to instruct them.</p>
               <p>The Jewish Church being then in this condition of Infancy, these divers ways, which God made use of to instruct it by, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed something to the easier un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding of that which he design'd it should know, and had more power to prevail upon their minds, by affording matter of admiration by rare and miraculous events, then
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:51065:68"/>
if the things had been deliver'd more plain and naked.</p>
               <p>I say expresly, that which God design'd they should know, because sometimes the same things have been made use of for different purposes; For the Institution of Types, Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical Representations of things to come and those Admirable Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical visions have been often made use of, as a veil to cover and hinder the understanding of those things which ought not otherwise to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreted, then by the events.</p>
               <p n="2">2. For the Second, since it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed God to make use of all these means to reveal himself to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and by them to others also, there is no reason why he should have excluded that of dreams: and indeed there is yet this further rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son in particular for them above others, that although there is a great deal of vanity in ordinary dreams, and that those which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from Angels have very often much of uncertainty and ambigui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:51065:69"/>
and that some Philosophers, as <hi>Aristotle</hi> among others, did suppose that there ought to be no regard had to that way of Divination, yet it hath always been almost the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal opinion of all Nations, that the Divinity did principally Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it self to Men by Dreams. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> hath attributed some to his <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi>: The <hi>Stoicks</hi> held that there were some altogether Divine: <hi>Plato</hi> said the same in some respects, and generally in the Eastern Nations, this opinion had a very great repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: So that it was principally in those Nations that they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd the interpretation of dreams into an Art, and have laid down Rules concerning it; and now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the people of <hi>Israel</hi> were also of the same opinion, God therefore chose to send them such dreams, as were truly Divine; thus firmly to fix them to these, and to divert them from that vanity, to which other Nations suffer'd themselves to be carried by those others; and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:51065:69"/>
'tis true, that the most natural way of conveying the knowledge of any thing whatever, even of the Deity it self, to men, is either by the presentation of some visible things, which furnish them with the means, and occasions of reasoning, and thus to rise from the considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the effect to the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature of the Cause, as is done in the dispensation of nature; or by way of speech, and to make known truths to them by vocal instruction, as under the dispensation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel; thus S. <hi>Paul</hi> joyns these two dispensations together, when he says, <hi>that since in the wisdom of God, the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to save those that believe</hi>: But to be thus instructed, there is need of more clearness and strength of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding then we ordinarily have in our Infancy, so that the Church being then in that estate, it ought to be instructed some other way: Now among all the ways and methods
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:51065:70"/>
made use of for this purpose, there was none more proper nor sutable, then that of dreams; for as <hi>Plato</hi> saith, when a man, whose stomack is full of wine and victuals, comes to sleep, 'tis certain that such an one is very unfit to receive the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication of the Deity, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions fram'd in such an ones fansy would be very obscure, confus'd and turbulent.</p>
               <p>But when an honest man, one who is sober and temperate, when such an one dreams, and that after a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect concoction of his meat, there now rises no more vapours to his head, but is in a profound sleep, his humours calm and sedate, his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation still and clear, as the smooth surface of a mirrour or looking-glass, being then sequestred from all the things of this present life and the commerce of sense, he is thus a very proper subject to receive the impression of Divine things, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God himself declaring the way by which he would reveal him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:51065:70"/>
amongst the Prophets, which he rais'd to his people <hi>Israel,</hi> he said, that he would do it by visions and dreams.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The Characters by which they might know that those Dreams were truly Divine, and not vain Delusions.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEfore I come to decide the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond question, I must briefly premise this, that when I did di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish dreams into three kinds, and plac'd those that proceed from the operation of Angels in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, and Divine Dreams in the third rank, I understood the distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction thus; among those that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the operation of Angels, there may also be found Divine ones, in as much as God doth not only permit, but also may command the impression of them: but those, I call Angelical Dreams, are meerly
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:51065:71"/>
such as those, which I have given Examples of, in as much as neither the formation of the images of which they consist, doth exceed their power, nor is the knowledge of the thing, which these Images represent, above their natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, nor above the quickness of their conjectures and divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for their Spiritual Nature, their long experience of things, the knowledge they have of the secrets of nature and of the inclinations of men, with divers other assistan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which we have not, do enable them to reach much further, then we can, into the knowledge of future things.</p>
               <p>Among those I call'd Divine Dreams, there are also some which consist of certain Images, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation whereof is not above the power of Angels; and yet I call them Divine, because that, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was God that employ'd these Angels to convey them, or whether they were immediately caus'd by
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:51065:71"/>
himself, nevertheless the things signify'd by them did so far exceed the natural ability of an Angels understanding, that it was absolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impossible they should ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to the knowledge of them, but by a particular Revelation; for though their knowledge, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd with ours, be much greater, and their fore-sight of things reaches much further, yet it is limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and that so, that they neither see things to come either long before, or with any great certainty.</p>
               <p>Those then may be reputed to come from God, which by what messenger soever they be convey'd, yet contain such things, as God only is able to know and to reveal.</p>
               <p>To return then to my purpose, we may boldly affirm, both <hi>that those dreams had some marks by which they might be known to be Divine, and also, that is was necessary, that they should have so; although we do not now cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly know, wherein those marks did consist.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:51065:72"/>First, that they had such, for all those other ways, by which God is reveal'd to men, of which we have spoken before, have been distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, each by it's particular mark and character, by which it might be discern'd from all other things, where the resemblance or similitude they bare to each other, might cause any doubt, whether these might come from God or no. The voice which <hi>Abraham</hi> heard had something in it, whereby to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish it from other voices, which might be made by the ministery of evil Angels, and especially that where God commanded him to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice his Son; This command being so contrary to his natural affections, and having the appearance of a barbarous and unparallel'd cruelty, How should this holy man be perswaded to execute it, if he had not had some mark, to know God to be the Author of it; and that so certain, that it could not be impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to any other cause. <hi>Moses</hi> his
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:51065:72"/>
vision in the bush, to perswade him to undertake the deliverance of <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and his Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of it into the Land of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> ought likewise to have some such signal character upon it; for how could he resolve upon so great an enterprise, accompanied with so great difficulties, if he had not been well perswaded, that it was God, who promis'd that he should over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them all? S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s vision could not be less remarkable, which prevail'd with him, to begin the preaching of the Gospel among the Gentiles, being a thing which the Jews had a great aversion against. The impression of those things in the understandings of <hi>Moses,</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> and divers others, ought also to have some signs, by which they might be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged for Divine truths, otherwise these great Persons would never have related them with so great confidence to others, and as to themselves, could never have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:51065:73"/>
so great satisfaction therein. Lastly, Those Heroick transporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Ehud</hi> and <hi>Phineas</hi> to those actions related in Scripture, ought to be very distinct, clear and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, otherwise they would not have suffer'd themselves to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd to those actions, which had been truly punishable, and even in some sort horrible both before God man, if they had not proceeded from a Divine command. Dreams then without doubt have likewise had their certain marks, whereby to distinguish them from the Noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal illusions that proceed either from the impression of evil Angels, or from natural causes, as I intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before.</p>
               <p n="2">2. And it is also necessary that they should have such marks, for the same reasons which I alledged before upon former occasions; For when God commanded <hi>Ioseph</hi> in a dream to carry <hi>Iesus</hi> into <hi>Egypt</hi>; Such thoughts as these might have come into his mind. <hi>This dream
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:51065:73"/>
perhaps may be only a vain imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a meer phantasm of my own brain, which hath no foundation of truth in it: Perhaps the great solicitude I am always in for the preservation of this miraculous Infant, hath sent into my soul this</hi> Idea <hi>or opinion, that they now seek his life, though perhaps they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so much as think of any such thing: Perhaps it is some evil spirit which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther takes pleasure to give me needless fears, or would incite me to remove this Infant from hence, that so upon the way he might more easily lay and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his treacherous designs</hi>; in a word, divers such like things might come into his thoughts, and cause a great uncertainty of resolution, what he had best to do upon the command. And nevertheless it appears by the history, that he did not at all hesitate upon it, which shews that he had a powerful perswasion of the truth of the dream. Now though we cannot at present certainly know, wherein this full perswasion did consist, and upon what it did depend, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:51065:74"/>
we ought not at all to question, but that this and the like perswasions were founded on some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that was both in it self suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and to them a sufficiently evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ground of their assent.</p>
               <p>But we must enquire what that was, and this is the proper subject of this Meditation; since there are but three sorts of dreams, those which are produc'd by natural cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, those which proceed from the operation of Angels, and those, which I call Divine. The readiest way to come to the knowledge of the truth in this case, will be to shew that these can neither belong to the first nor the second rank, and thence it will necessarily follow, that they must belong to the third. As for natural dreams, I suppose, that 'tis easie to distinguish those from such as proceed from a Divine impression: these natural dreams, I said, were of four sorts; the first depends upon the temperament and constitution of the body, others ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:51065:74"/>
no other cause, then the meer motion of the <hi>Idea's</hi> of the brain by the natural heat in the time of sleep; the others come from a very attentive application of our minds to some things when we were awake; and the last from the passions of the sensitive soul, which is, as it were, awaken'd and acts more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorously during the repose of our senses. But now, for Example, to which of these causes can we refer the dreams of <hi>Ioseph</hi> or <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> What mark do they bear of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament of their bodies, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of their humors? What <hi>Idea's</hi> of things could remain in their memory, which could be able so regularly to proportion these dreams, as to see in the one, the number of the sheaves, and of the Stars, the Sun and the Moon, and their prostrations before him; in the other, the number of the Ears of Corn, both the empty and the full ones, of the Kine, the fat and the lean ones, and their action in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:51065:75"/>
one another? What so great attention of mind could be upon any worldly care or employment as to cause any such representations in their sleep? What passion could move either their concupiscible or their irascible appetite, as thereby to form such phantasms? And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the dreams that come from any of these causes are always irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and composed of parts not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with one another, so that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is commonly more phantastick and extravagant then they: but those of <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and the Image of <hi>Nabuchodonosor,</hi> and if there be any other of the same nature mentioned in Scripture, they are so admirably well composed, that they seem to be the result of a very intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Cause. The dreams which proceed from natural causes are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and always presented to our minds with a great deal of confusion, so that we observe nothing distinct in them, or if one part have some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of clearness and perspicuity
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:51065:75"/>
in it, the others are commonly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd and intricate. Whereas those dreams related in Scripture, are not only clear, but full of light, whether we consider them in the whole, or in their parts; natural dreams do make so little impression upon our Spirits, that for the most part, we do not remember them when we are awake; whereas the Divine are firmly fix'd in our me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory: for as for what is reported of <hi>Nabuchodonosor,</hi> that he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got his dream, and that he stood in need of <hi>Daniel,</hi> to recal it again into his mind, this happen'd by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular dispensation of the Divine Power and Providence which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd out of his mind the <hi>Idea's</hi> of his vision, thereby to render the wisdom of <hi>Daniel</hi> more remarkable: besides this Prince very well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred that he had dream'd, and the perplexity which his dream caus'd in him, the passionate desire he had to recal it, the manner of his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to the Sooth-sayers and all
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:51065:76"/>
the rest which pass'd upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, fully shew'd that this vision did very nearly concern him, and that also in his dream he had observ'd something that was singular and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary in it: if in the morning we remember our natural dreams, yet we disregard them and count them but meer trifles; whereas those to whom God sent those Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Dreams, did not only distinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remember them, but had them still firmly represented to them when they were awake, and did look upon them as Divine adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements, and were very solicitous about the interpretation, or the event of them. When dreams pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from natural causes have made any impression upon our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, so that they hold us in some suspense in the morning, as it some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happens, we commonly do these two things: First, We make an attentive reflexion thereupon, and carefully examine and consider them in all their circumstances, and
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:51065:76"/>
at last find them to be meer vanities, and produc'd by some of those na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural causes before mention'd, and so we free our selves from that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietness they had before caus'd in us. Secondly, If we cannot thus wholly free our selves, then we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them with those true and real operations, which our senses pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce in us waking, and by thus comparing them, all those impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which these dreams had made upon our spirits, do altogether va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish. For it is here almost as in the comparison of things represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a Theatre, with those that are really done. Whilst we see a Tragedy acted, we feel a concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and passion in us, sometimes even to the effusion of tears. But this only touches, as it were, the surface of the soul, and is not of any long continuance, or if this emotion of the mind do continue longer, yet it is as good as nothing in respect of that which the real view of these actions and passions,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:51065:77"/>
and murthers actually committed in our sight, do cause in us; but in Divine Dreams it was directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, for if those, to whom they were sent, did in the least doubt of their Divinity, and did set them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves seriously to examine them, the more they consider'd them, the less reason they found to doubt of them; and when they compar'd them with the operation of their senses, they found, to their great astonishment and admiration, that even those of sense were less true and real, then they; these Divine Dreams, I say, made a more strong and firm impression upon the Spirits of those that receiv'd them, and they were more fully perswaded of their Divinity, then we are of the reality of the operation of our sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, when waking they exercise themselves upon their respective objects, and it is no difficult thing to give a reason for it. That which causes sensation, and makes us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the truth and reality of the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:51065:77"/>
actions of sense, is, that those sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible species, which affect the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward senses do also pass into the Common-sense, which is a faculty superior to them, so that it can judge of their actions and of the things imprinted thereupon. It can also compare the action of one sense with the operation of another, and laying them together confer their respective properties and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities; and the judgment that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults from hence, depends as well upon the impression, which the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject makes upon the external organ, according as it is more or less in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tense, as upon the nature of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and Common-sense, which is a corporeal faculty, and that which belongs to the sensitive part of the soul, of which Dogs and Horses and other animals do also partake. As for Divine Dreams, the impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion was indeed make in the fansy, which is also a corporeal faculty, it being one of the internal senses; but the reflexion which the servants
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:51065:78"/>
of God made thereupon, when wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, was the work of the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, which is more clear and exact in its operations, and <hi>which in the Prophets and those other faithful men, to whom these dreams were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey'd, was further enlightned by the Spirit of God, to judge aright of the object which it had so attentively consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd.</hi> The impression then of these dreams being more profoundly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed upon the phansy, for as much as it came from a supernatural cause, then that which the sensible objects make upon our outward sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses; and the faculty, which did consider and reflect upon them (both as to the whole and the parts and the circumstances that attended them) being more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and more exact in its judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then tis possible for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense to be, consequently the result thereof ought to be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably more perfect, and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion of the divinity of these dreams more certain and more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:51065:78"/>As for the dreams which proceed from the operation of Angels, it must be acknowledged they are more difficultly distinguish'd from those that are Divine: for they are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a more regular formation, then those that are produc'd by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural causes; they may be more strongly imprinted upon the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and so may be of longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance, so that we may more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily remember them, when we do awake; in a word, they are of greater force to perswade us, that they proceed from a Divine prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. For the understanding of an Angel doth manifestly shew it self, as well in the methodical placing of the parts of the dream, from whence it draws its symmetry and propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as in the resemblance which they bear to the things, which they are designed to represent; as we have seen before in the dream of the Egg and the Treasure, to which we might add many others of the like sort: Yet here we must call to mind
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:51065:79"/>
what was before said of this matter, that there is a great deal of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt the dreams which may have been caus'd by Angels only, for as much as that which they contain'd and whereof they did consist, was not above either, the understanding or the activity of Angels; and betwixt those of which they were only the Instruments to form the Images in the phansy of Gods servants, according to the Command, and according to the Revelation which he had given them, of his Will: As for the first, the comparing the actions of good and bad Angels would easily show the difference, and it might more especially be made in this double re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect: (1.) The Images that good Angels did imprint upon the phansy, did never contain any thing of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry or Pagan superstition, whereas those, which proceeded from evil ones, were commonly full of it: for in these there was always either some representation of false gods,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:51065:79"/>
or something which concern'd their worship, or some other vision of that nature, which denoted the author of the dream to be willing to authorize Idolatry or Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, from which the Inclination of good Angels was always very di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) The dreams caus'd by evil An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels did always, or at least for the most part induce to some evil acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which the good ones never do, who as they are free from temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to evil themselves, so do they never tempt others to it. That which might render the discerning betwixt these two more doubtful or more difficult, is, that upon this, as upon other occasions, these An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels of darkness might transform themselves into Angels of light, and endeavour to impose upon the credulity of the faithful, by causing them to have such dreams which should not seem to contain any thing of that vice, we before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, and which should tend to
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:51065:80"/>
actions indifferent in themselves, or such as perhaps might have the appearance of good, but yet such as they might make use of for some evil design. And the dream sent to <hi>Ioseph,</hi> to command him to carry Christ into <hi>Egypt</hi> may serve for an Example; for, as I have already said, <hi>Ioseph</hi> might perhaps think that this was a meer illusion of the devil, who design'd hereby to lie in wait for him to destroy him.</p>
               <p>Here we may lay down these se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral considerations. First, That how great a cheat soever the Devil is, yet he can never counterfeit so well, but something will happen whereby he may be discovered: they say, that when he visibly appears in humane shape, what ever care he takes to disguise himself, yet there is always something in the appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which he may be known, either by the horror of his Claws, or some stinking smell or some such like thing which presently appears
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:51065:80"/>
and renders the vision terrible and frightful.</p>
               <p>Whether it be so, or no, I know not, I will not affirm it, though it be not without some appearance of reason. But as for what concerns his actions and the means he makes use of, whereby to deceive men, whether by dreams or by voice, or any other illusion, neither is his own malice able, nor will the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Providence suffer him so per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly to resemble the actions of good Angels, but there will be some mark by which to discern them. And what I said before upon occasion of the dream of the <hi>Arcadian,</hi> is found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only upon the relation that <hi>Cicero</hi> makes of it.</p>
               <p>If we had had a perfect and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire account thereof, with all its circumstances, one might certainly have found something in it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we might easily have known, whether it proceeded from a good or bad Angel. Hence I dare boldly affirm, that if the dream sent to <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>
                  <pb n="74" facs="tcp:51065:81"/>
had come from an evil spirit, there would have been something more in it, then what is related of it, whereby this holy man would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily have known, that it was not of a Divine Inspiration.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Not only dreams pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from the Devil have some character, from whence we may conclude their original, but also those that come from good Angels have something on the contrary, whence we may conclude their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor truly good, for naturally every effect retains some mark of its cause; Fire leaves something of it self, where it exercises its power; and Water, where it passes; Beasts do imprint something upon their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per operations; and Men and other intelligent agents, on theirs, and generally all manner of productions bear some indications of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of their cause. And the more excellent the causes are, the more knowable they are in their effects, unless on set purpose they corrupt
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:51065:81"/>
their action and designedly disguise it, as when <hi>David</hi> counterfeited the fool, which yet Angels never do. From whence I conclude, that since it was a good Angel, which by the command of God, convey'd this dream to <hi>Ioseph</hi> (for the Scripture doth openly attest it) it was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt accompanied with very evident arguments of the nature of its cause.</p>
               <p>First it is absolutely said, that <hi>an Angel of the Lord appeared to Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph in a dream,</hi> and afterwards that he spake to him, saying, <hi>Rise and take the little Infant and his Mother, and fly into Egypt and stay there, until I bring thee word, for Herod seeks the Infant, to put him to death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Where we have the Apparition, after that the Command, lastly, the Reason which he there alledges; as for the Apparition, that could not be, but in some Image, which must appear visible, which might sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolically represent the Angelical Nature, for that being spiritual and
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:51065:82"/>
immaterial, it could not otherwise be represented to this holy man: For who can doubt but that Image had something so splendid and glorious, that <hi>Ioseph</hi> seeing it in his sleep, and after remembring it, when awake, was in both equally struck with admiration of its Magnificence? and what essay made by an Angel of darkness to imitate the splendour of such a vision, could come near the glory of the appearance of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Messenger, who brought the Commands of God to men and for that purpose was adorn'd with a ray of the Divine Majesty?</p>
               <p>As for the Command, that could not be given but by the mediation of a voice, which <hi>Ioseph</hi> in his sleep imagin'd to hear, as he apprehended he saw the Angel encompass'd with light. I do not here say, that mens voices have such different marks of distinction one from another, as that blind men, as Historians do testify, have distinguish'd them in a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, by the meer characters of
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:51065:82"/>
their voices, although they have but once heard them speak; Since perhaps it might be reply'd that blind men having often heard other men speak, are thus better enabled to make the distinction; whereas 'tis possible that <hi>Ioseph</hi> never heard the voice of any, either good or bad Angels before, and upon this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count could not compare them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: to which may be added; that the natural voice of men is of one kind, and that which Angels form only by representation in the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a man asleep, of another. I shall here only return, that as the Image or apparition of the Angel had something particular in its lustre and Majesty, so the voice had some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the tone, and in the nature of its articulation extraordinarily Majestick. So that as the Devil could never be able to frame an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition of himself which might come in competition with the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnificence of that vision, so neither could he counterfeit a voice, which
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:51065:83"/>
might equal the Majesty and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of that of a good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the Reason of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is very remarkable, for it would have been very strange, if the Devil should have been careful for the preservation of the life of an Infant, from whose birth, if we do consider the miracles that did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company it, he could expect nothing, but the ruine of his Empire: he is a murtherer from the beginning, and if it were in his power, would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all the Infants that come into the world from the very Cradle, but that he foresees some, who come for the ruine of mankind, as <hi>Nero's</hi> and <hi>Caligula's.</hi> And since if this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant was in any danger, it was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly under the dominion of <hi>Herod,</hi> who of his own nature was cruel, who had more reason of fear from the birth of Christ, then any other Potentate whatever, and who had an absolute power in those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, if the Devil had had a design
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:51065:83"/>
to impose upon <hi>Ioseph</hi> by his delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, would he ever have induc'd him to have left the place, where he was, to have gone to another? Where could he have laid his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signs against Christ with greater hopes of success then where he was, being, as it were, in the Paws of a Lion, or in the den of a wild beast?</p>
               <p>Thirdly, It plainly appears that <hi>Ioseph</hi> was fully perswaded of the Divinity of the vision, seeing that without any deliberation, as soon as he awoke, he arose and took the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant and fled into <hi>Egypt</hi>; now the dreams which come from natural causes, do not carry us to any acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and we think we should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for fools, if we undertook any thing, though of never so little im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance upon the meer solicitation of a dream. And those very dreams which yet have something more of life and vigour in them, then natural ones have, and upon this account may be attributed to some
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:51065:84"/>
Spirit; these indeed may cause a great deal of disquiet, of hope or apprehension, but they do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce us to undertake any resolution in things of Consequence, unless it be those of Melancholy tempers or unsound brains: Since then <hi>Ioseph,</hi> who was a wise and sober man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took himself so readily to the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the command, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he was fully perswaded of the Divinity of the Revelation: for since Jesus was his Son, we cannot think that he would have rashly taken up such a resolution; much less certainly would he have done it, the question being then of him, of whom he had the honour to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Guardian.</p>
               <p>Now this perswasion must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily come from one of these two things,
<list>
                     <item>
                        <p n="1">1. He either found in the object it self such irrefragable arguments of its truth, that there remain'd no place for deliberation, but his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding immediately determin'd it self:</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="81" facs="tcp:51065:84"/>Or, Secondly, if the Arguments were not altogether so strong and evident as to force his judgment to embrace the object, then God by the incomprehensible power of his Spirit did so effectually determine it on this side, that it could not possibly resist.</p>
                        <p>This latter is the less usual me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of Gods proceedings; but when it doth so come to pass, then it is an undoubted proof that the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is truly Divine. For it is only God, who doth so rule in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing of wise and vertuous men, and who so powerfully inclines it to such a belief and resolution, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it doth not see in the object reasons altogether proportionable to the effect it feels in the soul: So that if <hi>Ioseph</hi> was thus perswaded to the execution of the command, he then had in his own private sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents and in the extraordinary determination of his understanding, an evident proof of the Divinity of his dream.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="82" facs="tcp:51065:85"/>The first of these is without doubt the more common and natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral: for what the Loadstone is to Iron, that is truth to the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, which doth greedily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, and inseparably joyns it self to it, when once by evident de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrations it clearly apprehends it: If then <hi>Ioseph</hi> by this means was perswaded, then his understanding saw such marks of the truth and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity of the dream, that he did more certainly believe it, then he either did or could do those corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real objects, which represented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to his sense.</p>
                        <p>As for those dreams whereof An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels may have been the instruments, but not the Authors, they were easie to be distinguish'd from all others: For besides, as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that every effect draws some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from the nature of the cause, and causes the more excellent they are, the greater impression they make upon their effects, whether God did mediately or immediately
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:51065:85"/>
convey those dreams; so far it was necessary they should bear some undoubted mark and character of his power: this only thing was enough to distinguish them from all others, that they contain'd in them things which pass'd the reach of the understanding both of Men and Angels; for how could it enter into the understanding of either of them, that <hi>Ioseph</hi> should come to that grandeur which his dreams pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd? What created intelligence could Divine, that there should be in <hi>Egypt</hi> seven years of plenty and abundance, and after them seven others of dearth and barrenness, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> saw in his? For grant that Angels have very much of the knowledge of natural causes, yet two such admirable events, so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and constant, each for the space of seven years, how could they be searched into, being so closely and obscurely hid in the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret foldings of a particular provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence? What humane understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or what foresight of Angels
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:51065:86"/>
could discover both the succession and the disagreement, the duration and the end of all those Empires, which were represented one after another in the image of <hi>Nabuchodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosor</hi>? What conjecture could di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine that, which the stone cut without hands did presage, and what it was to do and to become, as the same vision of <hi>Nabuchodonosor</hi> doth represent it? And if it were necessary here to speak of <hi>Iacob's</hi> vision, none, I say, not only of men, but none of those Angels themselves, which he saw ascend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and descending upon the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, were able to foretel (if God had not extraordinarily reveal'd it) that that did represent the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sias to come, who should make peace between heaven and earth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish a communication betwixt God and men by the intermission of Angels; and as for the promises, which God, who was at the top of the ladder in heaven, made to the Patriarch, they were plain and clear according to the truth of things,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:51065:86"/>
without any shadow of Allego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or mysterious Symbol, but they were of things so far re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, that it was only God who could foresee or foretel the event, so that that vision was altogether Divine.</p>
                        <p>This is well indeed, will some here object, these dreams appear to be Divine when they are under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, or when they are confirmed by the events; but let us here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, how they could be judged so, by those to whom they were sent, before the interpretation, and by the meer consideration of the dreams themselves. We must then distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish betwixt the dreams themselves and their interpretations, (which were sometimes made by the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi>) and their events. And to begin with the consideration of their events, it is certain that when they were once come to pass, they did then fully evidence the Divinity of those visions, that did represent
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:51065:87"/>
them; For not to speak of the Image of <hi>Nabuchodonosor,</hi> which did prefigure things at such a distance, that all the Angels together were never able to foretel them; I shall only speak of those of <hi>Ioseph</hi> and <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and the Officers of his house, who were in prison with <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seph</hi>; who, having seen the things so punctually accomplish'd, could in the least doubt, but that they were of Divine Revelation? But this is not that which we here principally intend.</p>

                     <item>2. As for their interpretations, it is certain that those admirable resemblances, that are betwixt them and the visions themselves, must needs be matter of great wonder to those, who heard them, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the event: for these resemblan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could not come by meer chance: since there did appear in every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular so exact a relation between them, and we see that <hi>Nabuchodono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sor</hi> was ravish'd with admiration of them, and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was so fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:51065:87"/>
that without any further consultation he preferr'd <hi>Ioseph</hi> to the highest dignity, with an abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute power to dispose of the affairs, particularly of the revenues, of <hi>Egypt,</hi> according to his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to provide himself by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision of the plenty of the seven first years, against the desolation which should be caus'd by the seven years dearth: but 'tis true, that this also doth not reach to a full and proper answer to the objection: since the divinity of the dreams ought to appear in themselves.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Here then we ought to observe the difference betwixt those dreams which brought with them matter of express commands, as those which were sent to <hi>Ioseph</hi> and to the wise men, which came to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship our Saviour, and those which consisted simply in Symbolical and Allegorical representations of things to come. Those of the first sort ought to contain in them evident and undoubted characters of their
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:51065:88"/>
Divinity, otherwise they could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have powerfully enough per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded the servants of God to obey them: those of the latter did not absolutely require so great a force and evidence, and yet 'tis certain, that these have been able to make such a powerful impression upon the minds of those that receiv'd them, that they <hi>certainly believ'd</hi> them to proceed from a supernatural and Divine Cause. <hi>Ioseph</hi> sufficiently testifies this by the earnestness he shows to relate his, for that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to acknowledge that he had seen something that had made very sensible impressions on him. The Officers of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> house did the same in theirs, and testify'd that they did not take them for rash and vain delusions: and <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did yet appear more lively and deeply mov'd by his, in regard of that pain and uneasiness he was in, till he had obtain'd the understanding and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of it.</p>
               <p>Not to repeat what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:51065:88"/>
said concerning the means by which the divinity of dreams sent from above might be discerned from the vanity of those that proceed from natural causes (though it be also necessary to remember all those characters which do distinguish them) I say, there was never any of that kind which did not cause a great astonishment in those that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd them. I shall begin with the consideration of those which are less remarkable and by degrees pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to those that are more famous. <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Cup-bearer dream'd that he saw a vine, which had three branches, from whence sprang cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain buds, which increas'd and blos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som'd: that at the same time the bunches of grapes blossom'd and brought their fruit to maturiy; That he had <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> Cup in his hand, and that he took the grapes and press'd and strain'd them into the Cup, and then gave it into <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> hand, now I pray, the dreams which proceed from our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:51065:89"/>
temper and constitution, or from the motion of the <hi>Idea's</hi> in our memory caus'd by natural heat, or from the application of our minds to the cares and businesses of life, or from the motion of our passions, are they either so emblematical on the one side, or so regular on the other, as to present, in their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry constitutions, Symbols consisting of so many parts, which answer one another with so great proportion? To which if you add that this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem, as it was distinct and articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, so was it also lively, clear, deeply impress'd upon the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, you will not find it any way strange if it pass'd in the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of the Cup-bearer for a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and extraordinary dream: but he had yet more reason to be of that opinion, when his Companion, the Baker, told him in the morning that he had also dream'd the same night, that there were three white baskets upon his head, and that in the uppermost there was all manner
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:51065:89"/>
of provisions relating to the Bakers trade for <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and that the Birds did eat them out of the Basket, as it was upon his head: for this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, that they both dream'd at the same time, and saw visions rare in their compositions, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable in their parts, Symbolical, without doubt, in their significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, sutable each to the Office of the dreamer; which agreed both in the number three, although they did otherwise differ in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable circumstances; lastly, which had made very great impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions upon them both; all this, I say, could not be brought about but by an intelligent and heavenly cause; so that, 'tis no wonder if the perplexity which these visions caus'd in their minds did equally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the Morning by the change of their countenances: The dreams of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had yet something of more exactness in the just proportion and symmetry of their parts; seven young kine on the one hand, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:51065:90"/>
seven more on the other; the good and strong constitution of the one seven, and the leanness of the other; the beauty of the fat ones, and the gastly ugliness of the other; the action of the one, which devoured and swallowed up the other, and all this without any mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of any thing that was phanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical or extravagant, as it common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happens in dreams, and without any circumstance from whence <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi> might infer that there was any thing in it, which might in the least argue any tincture, either of his cares or passions, either of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of his humours or the temperament of his body, this was sufficient even at first to cause ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and perplexity in his thoughts. And indeed, in that it is said, he wakened upon his dream, this shows that he was very sensibly touch'd with it, for those dreams that make any great impres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion upon us do awaken us. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was not much fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:51065:90"/>
at his first dream, and went again to sleep as before; but when another vision answerable to the first represented to him on the one hand seven fair and full ears of Corn, and on the other seven small ones, bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted with the East wind, and that the small and withered ones devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fair and full ones; then he did not at all doubt, but it was God that spake to him by these repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations, so that his very soul was terrified. And indeed these two visions thus presented one upon the neck of another, were too clearly and visibly mysterious, not to cause something of astonishment. Those of <hi>Ioseph</hi> appear to me yet more admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
               <p>He first saw the sheaves of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren which did encompass his sheaf and prostrate themselves before it; which had so clear and plain a signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that his brethren understood it at the very first: a little after in another dream he saw the Sun and Moon and Eleven Stars, which also
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:51065:91"/>
fell down before him; which still contain'd the same thing in such an illustrious and glorious Emblem, that when he came to recite it, his father did not only understand it, but was offended at it and chid him for it: Whether then we suppose, that <hi>Iacob</hi> and his other children did really believe that <hi>Ioseph</hi> had thus dream'd, or that they suspected that he had contriv'd it, yet it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestly appears that they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged, that that could not proceed but from the operation of an intelligent agent. For meer chance could never have adjusted the parts of these visions singly, much less could it so well have joyn'd them both together: This then was enough to make them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve these dreams were supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. But yet there was another thing that might perswade <hi>Ioseph,</hi> that they were truly Divine, his conscience bare him witness that he was void of ambition, and if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he had had some kind of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:51065:91"/>
or tendency that way, yet however it would not have been to desire dominion over his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, much less would he have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sir'd it over those who begat him, for this is a monstrous desire, and such as is altogether unnatural. But grant he had such strange elevations of Spirit as to desire to become so great, as that his father and mother should prostrate themselves before him, whence was it that his imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation set it self to find out the Sun and Moon and Eleven Stars precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whereby to presage this Empire? It is a very rare thing, if in a meer natural dream, any one imagines that he sees the Sun, for there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways something that is black and dark in these nocturnal visions: But though that should happen much oftner, yet to see it in such a state of humiliation, and the Moon and Eleven Stars to represent that, which this dream prefigured, is a thing so far above that which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural causes are accustomed to do,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:51065:92"/>
that it would be too great an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence to impute it to them.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the dreams of <hi>Nabuchodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nosor</hi> are yet in my opinion some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more magnificent: for there a great Image was represented to the imagination of this Prince, the splendor whereof was excellent, and it's appearance terrible: the head thereof was of fine gold, the breast and arms of Silver, its belly and hinder parts of Brass, its legs of Iron, its feet partly of Iron, partly of Clay; after that appear'd to him a Stone, which of it self fell from a Mountain without being cut with hands, which rowling down struck against the feet of the image, and bruised them to pieces, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Iron, the Clay, the Brass, the Silver, the Gold were all equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bruis'd to pieces, and became like chaff in the air in Summer, blown up and down, and driven to and fro with a strong wind; so that all the materials, whereof the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age was composed, did vanish and
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:51065:92"/>
wholly disappear. But as for the Stone that broke the Image, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a great mountain, and fill'd all the universe: let us a little lay aside the interpretation of this vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and not at all consider the things design'd thereby; let us only consider the vision in it self, and see if ever any thing, like unto it, did enter into a humane understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: Certainly the <hi>Idea</hi> of such an Image, is so fair, the variety of the Metals and Materials, that compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed it, so remarkable; the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued series of them so admirably succeeding each other; the stone which broke and dash'd it in pieces and the manner of its coming so extraordinary and surprising; its increase so miraculous, and in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral the whole series of this repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentation so majestick, that it could never enter into the imagination of man, if it had not been sent from above: for certainly humane under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing was too little to serve for a mould, where so great and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:51065:93"/>
a work should be framed. And the effect, which it produced in the Spirit of <hi>Nabuchodonosor,</hi> is very considerable: he was a Prince, and those of that birth and dignity are not easily mov'd by extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary things; He was a great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch and Conquerour, and such Princes have commonly more ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated thoughts, then others: and of Monarchs and Conquerours, he was one who was puffed up with the opinion of his own grandeur, and this would be apt to make him in all conditions either sleeping or waking, to think most things either Ordinary or Common; and further, when he awakened, he did not at all remember his vision. Now when our dreams are vanish'd from our minds, the motion and impression, which they then made upon us, do usually cease and vanish with them: and though there did not remain the least footstep of his dream in his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, but only thus far, to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that he had dreamed, yet
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:51065:93"/>
when he came to acquaint his Soothsayers, Astrologers and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians herewith, he told them, that his Spirit did remain astonish'd, and the passion which he had to retrieve what was fled from him, that so he might have the interpretation of it, caused him to denounce threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and terrible punishments to them, in case they did not acquaint him with it; so that it must neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarily be, that he was inwardly sensible of something of divinity in the dream, that produc'd in him such a passionate desire to know the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</p>
               <p>I shall not here speak any thing of <hi>Iacob's</hi> vision, for that speaks enough of it self; for certainly the words he there heard did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise such great things, so far a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove either the power or know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of humane understanding, the voice of the speaker was so Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick, the image of a Ladder which reach'd from earth to heaven, upon which the Angels did ascend and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:51065:94"/>
descend, upon the top whereof God himself did seem to sit in a visible and humane shape and figure, as a presage of the future Incarnation of Christ; all this, I say, had so great, so glorious an aspect, and <hi>Iacob</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self was so struck with Reverence, Admiration and Amazement, that he was forc'd to cry out that the very place was terrible, and that in seeing this vision, he was set, as it were, in the threshold of the house God, and in the very porch of heaven. And this shows that this dream had made an impression in him quite different from those which proceed from na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural causes. I suppose I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready sufficiently discuss'd this que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, it only now remains to resolve the last.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Whether God doth make use of this kind of Revelation by Dreams, now under the Dispensation of the Gospel.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>JOel</hi> hath thus prophesy'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the time of the coming of the Messias, <hi>It shall come to pass in those days, saith God, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesy, your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams. And in those days I will surely pour out of my spirit upon my servants, and upon my handmaids, so that they shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesy: And I will do wonders in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven above and signs on earth beneath, blood and vapour of smoke; the Sun shall be turned into darkness and the Moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come.</hi> It is clear from these very words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, without any need of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:51065:95"/>
others, that at the coming of the Messias, God would pour out a great abundance of his Spirit upon his Church, which should render the extraordinary and miraculous gifts of prophesy, of visions and of dreams almost common to all the faithful, which God before did but sparingly communicate to some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular persons: and indeed, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles have apply'd this passage to the sending of the holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost, and the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of things at that time did very authentically testify the truth of this Prophesy; for the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and variety of gifts, which God poured upon Christians, at the first establishment of Christianity, is a thing much to be wondered at; in as much as he did not only inspire the Apostles, and Prophets &amp; Evangelists, the Pastors, Doctors and Deacons, and generally all those who had any publick Office or charge in the Chruch, but also many particular persons without any difference of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:51065:95"/>
Age, Sex or Condition. And the History of the Acts of the Apostles, with that which we have yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining of the succeeding Age, doth give us a very sufficient testimony hereof.</p>
               <p>But here are yet further two things very remarkable; the first, that the fulfilling of this prophesy, if we regard the Emphasis of the terms, wherein it is express'd, is not limited to the Infancy of the Church or an hundred or sixscore years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but extends to all the ages of Christianity, even to the end of the world. For here is an opposition of the times of the Gospel to the times of the Law, and by conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of all the duration of the one dispensation, to all the duration of the other.</p>
               <p>The second, that notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, we see by experience that those miraculous gifts of the Spirit of God are ceased long ago, so that it is now many Ages since we saw the least footsteps of them in the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:51065:96"/>
Christian Church: for all that hath been either spoke or written these twelve hundred years concerning those miraculous gifts, is either very much suspected, or altogether false and supposititious, and full of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and imposture; how then shall we reconcile our experience with this Prophesy?</p>
               <p>In Order to do it, and to clear the way for the solution of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent question, I think it convenient to lay down certain previous consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
               <p>First, It is certain, That which God promised by his Prophets, to give a great measure of his Spirit in the time of the Revelation of the Messias, must have its accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the first coming of Christ even unto his second; but in what manner it shall be done, is a thing that deserves a more attentive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration: for though the words of <hi>Ioel</hi> seem only to design the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:51065:96"/>
and miraculous gifts of the Spirit, yet under them are also compris'd, those more ordinary ones, which consist in the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the understanding of the faithful, in knowledge of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine truth, in consolation, in sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, in hope, in patience un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der temptations and afflictions, and in all Christian vertues; for it would have been a small thing for God to have promis'd abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of those gifts, which are truly miraculous, but such as of themselves are not effectual for the procurement of Salvation, and have kept back those which only are necessary and sufficient there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto: And indeed, we ought to understand that Prophesy of <hi>Isaiah</hi> in the same manner, <hi>Your God shall come himself, and shall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver you: then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped, then shall the lame leap, as the Hart, and the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:51065:97"/>
tongue of the dumb shall sing in tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, for the waters shall spring in the desart and torrents in solitary pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> It is very true, that those words have a proper and literal sense, which was accomplished at the coming of our Saviour, but they have also an Allegorical and Figurative one, which respects the saving graces of the Spirit, which have their accomplishment all along in all Ages of the Church.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It is further certain, that the reason for which these mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous gifts are expresly men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in this prophesy, and not the more ordinary and saving ones, is, because these promises are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd in terms more accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated to the legal dispensation, for under that oeconomy, the faithful very well knew, that all the good, that was in them, did come from God, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:51065:97"/>
return'd him thanks; <hi>Moses</hi> himself hath thus taught, and the <hi>Psalms</hi> of <hi>David</hi> are full of such acknowledgments, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they did not distinctly know, that it came from a particular o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the third Person in the Deity: the Spirit of Faith, the Spirit of Consolation, the Spirit of Adoption, the Spirit of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification being terms unknown to the Faithful of the Ancient Church; So that until <hi>David,</hi> who began to speak something of the Spirit of God, in matters rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Sanctification, no one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore spake any thing of it, and after him these Expressions, were very rare. Whereas there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ordinary in the Books of the Old Testament, then to attribute the Visions and Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Prophets, their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and miraculous gifts, which did both enlighten and asto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the World, to the Spirit of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:51065:98"/>
God; in so much that the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar skill which was bestowed on <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab</hi> to work in all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of carved work for the building of the Tabernacle of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is particularly attributed to the Efficacy of the Spirit of God, in the Books of <hi>Moses</hi>: It is true, the ordinary gifts of the Spirit of God are much less resplendent and cause less of admiration, then the extraordinary: for those are so in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal, that they do not show themselves, but in Actions of Piety, Charity and Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are commonly ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Moderate and Regular, <hi>and which unless we take a more close and exact view of them, do not seem to proceed from any other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, then that of right reason</hi>; Whereas the other do so dazle the eyes of all beholders with their lustre, that no one who sees their effects, can judge them to proceed from any thing less
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:51065:98"/>
then a Divine and Supernatural Cause.</p>
               <p>And this difference was so much greater under the Law, as the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary gifts were there less libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally bestow'd, and the vertues which they produc'd were more obscure and less frequent then they are now: and on the contrary, the extraordinary and miraculous gifts were then more common and agreed better with the genius of that Dispensation, in that it did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail upon the minds of men, not so much by the knowledge of the truth, as this doth now, as by the admiration of the power of God, and by the astonishment which those surprising and prodigious passages did produce.</p>
               <p>From hence, for a third conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, results the knowledge of the manner how this promise of <hi>Ioel,</hi> and such like, were to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:51065:99"/>
for it was very agreeable to the truth, that at the beginning of Christianity our Saviour should plentifully bestow upon his Church those miraculous gifts, which were there especially design'd. And two reasons among others invited him thereunto:</p>
               <p>The one, that the expressions which the Prophets had made use of, had fill'd the minds of men with expectation of these gifts: with expectation of theirs, if it had been frustrated in this respect, it would have given an occasion of scandal; therefore that men might not have any thing to object about the accomplishment of those promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, God was willing to signalize the beginning of the Preaching of the Gospel by those marvellous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances.</p>
               <p>The other, which is the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal, is, that the first establishment
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:51065:99"/>
of the Gospel had need of such a manifestation of the Spirit by the gift of miracles; because other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise it could never have destroy'd the dominion of Satan, as it did, and have vanquish'd the resistance it met with in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and in all other nations of the earth: for the Preaching of the Gospel, the working of miracles the distribution of the miraculous gifts of the Spirit have been the wings upon which the Church hath been carried through all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the World. Therefore the Apostle joyns these two together in the Epistle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> when he says, <hi>That salvation being first begun to be Preach'd by our Lord, it hath been confirmed to us, by those who heard it; God besides bearing witness by signs and miracles and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers powers and distributions of the spirit according to his pleasure.</hi> But when the Gospel was once well planted in the world, so that the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:51065:100"/>
Preaching thereof alone was suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to preserve and continue it, the necessity of miracles being now ceased, the use of them ceased likewise, and these extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gifts of the Spirit there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore disappear'd, because they were no longer necessary; thus the performance of this promise of <hi>Ioel,</hi> as far as it was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to all the times of the Christian Church, even to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation of the world, hath been restrain'd to the ordinary gifts of the Spirit of Faith, of Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of Sanctification, which are indeed much more plentifully pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out under this dispensation of the Gospel, then ever they were under that of the Law.</p>
               <p>To come therefore to a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar solution of this question, I think, we ought carefully to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguish betwixt Divine, Angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and Natural Dreams: for as
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:51065:100"/>
for those Divine Dreams, which are design'd to foretel things to come under the Emblem of an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legorical Representation, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey some new commands to men in order to some great and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary design, for which there is need of Divine Authority for the undertaking and executing of it: I conceive that time is now wholly expir'd, and those who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to and boast of any such, they are either impostors, who would abuse the world by their feigned visions, to serve their own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate interest; or else fools, who have their brains disturb'd by Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocondriack vapours: for we are no longer now under the legal dispensation, which was, as it were, the proper place for such things, nor under the Infancy of the Church, where such were necessary for its establishment. And if I may here speak my own thoughts of a certain kind of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:51065:101"/>
of both Sexes, who both in <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> have pretended to Divine visions in these latter days; I will not accuse them of imposture, for that they have given sufficient testimony of their Piety; but I dare be bold to say, that in their actions they had some transport of the understanding, which proceeded from some other cause then what was truly Divine. They were persons who partly out of devotion, partly out of great cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity, did extraordinarily give themselves to the reading of the Apocalypse and the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesies: the constancy they us'd herein, and the great affection they did it with, imprinted in their memories the <hi>Idea's</hi> of those things they there saw; and the Copies of those fair tables, where future events were represented, having given a tincture to their Spirits, two or three things have hereupon superven'd, which have
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:51065:101"/>
contributed to their perswasion, that their very dreams and the things they imagin'd they saw in their extasies, they sometimes fell into, were real and Divine vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions.</p>
               <p>First, they suffer'd themselves to be carried away by the hopes of those, who expect in due time a great prosperity of the Church of God on earth, and a terrible sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of all those States and Powers, which now oppose the establishing the kingdom of Christ, and since they desir'd this with a great deal of zeal and passion, they hereupon easily imagin'd it to be certain and indubitable. For on the one hand divers Texts of Scripture have some seeming ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of some such promises made to the Church of Christ: and on the other hand, it is one of the frailties of Humane Nature easily to believe what we desire
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:51065:102"/>
should be true. Besides the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy humour, which was na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally predominant in them, the afflictions, hardships and anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties they underwent, as well from the publick affairs, which did not go well to their satisfaction, as from their own private con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, which did not much more please them; all these concurring to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, made them very ready to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all impressions of phansy, which might show them either any hope of deliverance, or of any mitigation of their troubles.</p>
               <p>To conclude, their bodies were so affected with the passions of their souls and with the quality of the humours, which were predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant in them, that they fell into some black melancholy indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spositions, which all the world knows to be capable of very strange accidents. Be it then, that they either meerly dream'd, or that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:51065:102"/>
they were surpris'd with some transport of phansy, in which their soul was perfectly abstracted and separated from their body, and from all commerce with the senses (for that doth sometimes happen in Hypocondriack distempers) these <hi>Apocalyptical Images</hi> were thus put into a violent motion, and fram'd in their imaginations these pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed visions, which they have since related to us. To which might be added the operation of some evil Angels, who seek all imaginable oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions to deceive both the sound and the sick, and who help'd to joyn together and to paint these re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentations in the brains of those poor people: And we have seen in a great part by experience, that those images, which they saw in their pretended Enthusiasms, did either signifie nothing at all, or if they did, yet their vanity and falseness have been confuted by the events.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="118" facs="tcp:51065:103"/>As for those people beyond the Sea, which now boast of Visions, Revelations, Divine Inspirations, the extraordinary gifts of the holy Spirit, of extasies, and strange tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sportations, who by their <hi>tremblings and quakings</hi> would represent the motions of the Enthusiasts and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; I should very much wonder if honest and understanding men should favour their frenfies: The Spirit of Christ is a Spirit of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing and prudence, and of so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and well setled sense, and not a smoak which fills empty brains with dark and phantastick imaginations; the grace of the Gospel puts the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the soul into a grave and sober constitution, which gives both joy within to it self, and edification to others without, and doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the true Religion to the laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of its enemies and to the scandal of sober and intelligent men, by its indecent and unnatural motions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:51065:103"/>As for those dreams which may proceed meerly from the impression and operation of Angels, I will not deny but that there may be yet some examples of that nature to be seen; for as for evil Angels, they may concern themselves in those illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions which happen to men sleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whether it be to imprint upon them some false opinions in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and to incline them to Superstition; or thus more to excite and inflame their passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to put them into more disorder. And as for good ones, although the dispensation of the Law, under which they were more especially employ'd in things rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to Religion, be now pass'd; yet they still continue to be Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters and Instruments of Divine Providence in what relates to civil life, and humane society, and espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the protection of the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and the defense of the Church
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:51065:104"/>
of Christ. And as then it is not impossible, but that they may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times appear to men waking, so is it not incredible, but that God may make use of them, from time to time to convey the notices of some things by dreams; there are many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of both kinds in the books of those who have made collections of such memorable instances, to which I shall refer the Reader. I have heard the late Monsieur <hi>Cameron,</hi> a Person whose memory will be ever blessed in our Churches, say, that he had from the mouth of Monsieur <hi>Calig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non,</hi> Chancellor of <hi>Navarre,</hi> a man of singular vertue, a memorable passage that befel him in <hi>Bearne</hi>: He went into a certain Town in the Country, either for diversion, or for some reason, relating to his health; for he did not acquaint me either with the place or the occasion of the journey; one night as he was asleep, he heard a voice which call'd him by his name, <hi>Calignon</hi>;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:51065:104"/>
hereupon waking and hearing no more of it, he imagin'd that he had dream'd, and fell asleep again; a little after he heard the same voice, calling him in the same manner, which made a greater impression up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, then before; so that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing awaken'd he call'd his wife, who was with him, and told her what had happen'd, so that they both lay waking for some time, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting whether they might hear the voice again, and whether it would say any thing more to them; At last the voice awaken'd him the third time, calling him by his name, and advis'd him to retire presently out of the Town, and to remove his family, for that the plague would rage horribly in that place within few days; to which he added, that it was very well that he followed this direction, for as much as within few days after the plague began in the Town, and destroy'd a great number of people.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:51065:105"/>
This was certainly an Angel that spake to him, who by the favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and benign providence of God drew him out of that danger, which otherwise had been unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. For whether the plague came by the infection of the air, or by the Communication of some infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous persons, or whether some Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers and Witches (as they say, they sometimes do) had resolv'd to diffuse their infectious poisons in that place, it was that which did not exceed the knowledge of an Angel. Now if these blessed Spirits, which are appointed as a guard to pious men in obedience to God's Command, do sometimes by speaking give them such ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisements, they also by the same command may convey the same notices to them by dreams. The history of the last age doth so fully attest the truth of that of <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> Prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> that we cannot reasonably doubt thereof.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:51065:105"/>
A little before his journey from <hi>Dreux,</hi> he dream'd that he had fought three battels, successive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one after another, wherein he had got the victory, and where his three great Enemies were slain. But that at last he also was mortally wounded, and that after they were laid one upon an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, he also was laid upon their dead bodies. The event was remarkable: for the Mareshal <hi>de</hi> S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>André</hi> was kill'd at <hi>Dreux,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Guise, Francis</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> at <hi>Orleans,</hi> the Connestable of <hi>Montmorency</hi> at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Dennis,</hi> and this was the Triumvirate, which, they say, had sworn the ruine of those of the Religion, and the destru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of that Prince. At last, he himself was slain at <hi>Bassac,</hi> as if there had been a continuation of deaths and Funerals.</p>
               <p>Although there were some Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances in the dream which did
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:51065:106"/>
not exactly agree with their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment, as that he imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that his Enemies died in three battels; for the Duke of <hi>Guise</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed otherwise, being assassinated by <hi>Poltrot,</hi> and that he conceiv'd in his dream, that he always came off victorious, for he himself was taken at <hi>Dreux,</hi> and the glory of the victory at S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
                  <hi>Dennis</hi> was dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and 'tis believ'd, that at <hi>Bassac,</hi> he did not only lose his life, but the Battel too. Yet notwithstanding upon the whole, this vision did not cease to be very admirable, and it hath been look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as such by reason of the greatness of the events: But there might be something natural in it, in respect of the formation of the images in the phansie of the Prince. For he having the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of a Lion, and being brought up in War, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding an Army, might easily dream of Battels, the evening
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:51065:106"/>
before so great a Combat. And he himself seem'd sufficiently to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge this when repeating the dream he us'd this Preface; <hi>I know very well that we must not give any credit to dreams, but yet I must relate to you what I dream'd last night,</hi> and in truth one who thus speaks sufficiently testifies, on the one side, that his dream appear'd to him extraordinary, and that it had made a great impression upon his mind: and on the other, that he did not look upon it as absolutely su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural, seeing he somewhat doubted whether he should make any relation of it: But neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less, an Angel, to whom God had given some little foresight of the success of these Civil Wars, and of the end of these Captains, might very well concern himself herein by his permission, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign to give the Prince some ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertisement; for he might draw this advantage from hence, either
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:51065:107"/>
not to continue the War any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger if he had a mind to escape death, or seriously to prepare himself, as he should see his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to depart this life: and both these things were worthy of a good Angel, who had a care of the life of this great Prince and also of his Salvation. There are also several memorable things of such who were saved from the Massacre, by the advertisement of dreams, which if true, as I see no reasonable cause to doubt of them, they could proceed from nothing else, but Angels, as the truth of the things, and the punctual accomplishment did sufficiently evidence.</p>
               <p>But my intention here is not to report histories, but to make Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical and Rational Reflexions upon this matter. And the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion I draw hence is, that God has not now tied his hands; but that he may still give such notices
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:51065:107"/>
to men, although this be done ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry rarely: However we may here make this observation, that as, when the question is concerning such miracles as may be done by the Ministery of Angels (for every one knows that there are some, which cannot be done but only by the power of God) we ought carefully to examine whether they be done by good or bad ones, that so we suffer not our selves to be abused by the seducement of lies and error; so here there is need of a great circumspection, to judge of these nocturnal visions. All the actions of men are either good in themselves, or evil in their own nature, or indifferent and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate betwixt these; if then any such dream induce us to a good action, and from whence there can follow no bad event, such a dream ought not to be su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spected by us, but if it incline us to any evil, we ought abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:51065:108"/>
to condemn and reject it, as a delusion of the Devil; and as for indifferent actions, the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, that accompany them, usually determining their nature, I would here rather be guided by Prudence and Charity, which are the general Rules of our conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, then by the inducement and perswasion of dreams. And ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless where Prudence and Charity should both agree with an extraordinary vision, I do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that such an inducement to me would be very consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
               <p>Lastly, as for dreams that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from natural causes. I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that where I have spoken of their causes from whence they proceed, I have sufficiently di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scover'd their vanity. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a great weakness of mind or a superstition very unworthy of Christians in the least to rely on
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:51065:108"/>
them, either for the conjectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of that which is come, or for founding our resolutions of least importance upon them. I shall only here give two adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisements, the one whereof re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects the health of the Body, the other the safety of the Soul. First, then we ought to have a regard to our dreams, when they may furnish us with some indications concerning the constitution of our own bodies; that if they mark out any fault in our tempers, or any disorder in the humours of our body, and so threaten us with some disease or sickness, that then we may provide against it by the Course of Physick.</p>
               <p>As for the second, if the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency of certain dreams, and their evil quality, do inform us that we are inclin'd to some vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious passions (although this may be better known by our actions
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:51065:109"/>
waking, then by our dreams) that we then endeavour to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them by Christian Morality, Lastly, since as Philosophers have observ'd, the quality of dreams is a sign and token not only of the constitution of our bodies, but also of our minds, that the most vertuous have always the most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and temperate dreams, every one therefore ought carefully, to give himself to the exercise of Vertue, Temperance and Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that so he be not importun'd and molested with turbulent ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations.</p>
               <p>Thus, most Honoured Brother, you have the results of my thoughts when at certain spare hours in my journey I set my self to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate on this subject: if other affairs had not deny'd me further leisure, and if I had not been upon other designs, which I both promised, and which have been
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:51065:109"/>
long expected from me, I had bestow'd more care and study in this little Work. All that I was able to do, was to finish it, which I partly doubted whether I could or no, when I first set Pen to Paper: Such as it is, I heartily present it to you, and shall esteem it happy, if it receive your Approbation; for as much as that which you receive from the publick ought to render your testimony beyond exception. Sir, I beg the assistance of your good Prayers to God for me, not only that he would give me grace and strength to finish, what he hath put into my mind to undertake, for the clearing of his truth, but principally that, notwithstanding the many hindrances I meet withal, he would strengthen me with his good Spirit, that I may finish my course to his glory, and the edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his people. And I also do heartily pray, that he would
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:51065:110"/>
heap upon you the choisest of his blessings, and am assuredly,</p>
