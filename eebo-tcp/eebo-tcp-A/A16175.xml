         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

as the children of Iſrael did loath
Manna, (Angels foode) &amp; in their hearts
turned back to the fleſh pottes of Egypt:
as the Iewes at this time did ſeek Chriſt,
not for his doctrine, not for his mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,

had fedde them, and ſo fedde them, that
they had more ſtore left, when they had
done, then when they beganne to eate:
So becauſe the dayes of Noe are come,
becauſe the dayes of Lot are come, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

For as it was in the dayes of Noah, ſo
ſhall it bee in the dayes of the ſonne of
man, they ate, they dranke, they maried,
and gaue in mariage, vnto the day that
Noah went into the Arke, and the flood
came and drowned them all: lyke as it

drank, they bought, they ſolde, they pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

the people, Labour not &amp;c. Not onely to
diſſwade you fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> laboring for the meate
which periſheth, but to perſwade you to
labour for that meat which doth endure

firſt, a reaſon taken from the perſon

he beginneth with the dehortation.
<hi>Labour not, &amp;c.</hi> And bicauſe a litle before
mention was made of meat, he ſpeaketh
figuratiuely, vſing the Metaphore of
meate, whereas hee might plainely haue
ſaide, care not for the bodie to fulfill the
luſtes of it, but care for your ſoules, to
poſſeſſe the kingdome of heauen. And if
he had onely vſed the affirmatiue, exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to labour for meate, they might
haue been as groſſe in vnderſtanding
him, as his Diſciples were, who, when he

thought hee had ſpoken of the leauen

as rude as the woman of Samaria,
who,<note place="margin">Iohn. 4.</note> when Chriſt ſpake of the water of
life, thought he had ſpoken of the water
of Iacobs well. Therfore, as hee vſeth a
metaphore beeing plaine, ſo to make it
more plaine, ſo to ſhew whereunto their
nature was bent, ſo to declare what they
ſhould labour for, hee vſeth both the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmatiue
&amp; the negatiue: but hee begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth
with the negatiue, labor not, &amp;c. As
if he ſhould haue ſayd: Wilt thou come

Wilt thou come into my congregation?

Wine into olde bottelles: I will not put

come downe from the wild figge
tree. Wilt thou doe good? decline from

You cannot ſerue God and Mammon,
Chriſt and riches, you cannot labour for
the meate which periſheth, and for the
meate that endureth vnto euerlaſting
life. Were not a garment of linnen and
wollen: eate not with ſweete bread, and
ſower leauen: ſow not two ſorts of grain

are not fit for the kingdome of God. For
what felowſhip hath righteouſneſſe, and

light with darkneſſe,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 6.</note> what concord hath
Chriſte with Belial? what parte hath the

<pb facs="tcp:13120:11"/>
GOd and Mammon, meate which peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth,
and meate which endureth vnto e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlaſting

But let vs labour a little I pray you, for
this meate, a little is to be borne with.
What, know you not, that leauen, and a
little leauen, doth leaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the whole lump?
that a breache, and a little breache doeth
marre the ſale of a whole cloth? that a

poyſon, doth poyſon the whole bodie?
that <hi>Coloquintida,</hi> and a little <hi>Coloquinti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,</hi>
doth infect the whole pot of pottage?
that a hole, and a little hole in a veſſell,

<pb facs="tcp:13120:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
But alas,<note place="margin">Math. 13.</note> we are ſo far from labouring for
this meate, that whereas like good huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen
we ſhould labour &amp; dig in the

field. Whereas like wiſe Merchant men,
wee ſhoulde labour and ſeeke for good

that pearle of great price: We, like dogs
refuſe holy things offered, we turn about
and teare them that doe offer them: we
like ſwine, tread pearles vnder our feete,
and doe accounte this pearle, this holie
thing, the word of life, to bee vnto vs as
a ring of golde in a ſwines ſnoute. For
doeth the people delight to heare Gods
word? Behold yet they are like the deafe
adder, which ſtoppeth her eares, at the
voyce of the charmer, charme hee neuer
ſo wiſely. Or if they with delight doe
heare it, doe they vnderſtand it? behold
yet, they are like horſe and mule, which
haue no vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding, or if they heare it,
&amp; vnderſtand it, do they obey it? behold
yet, they are vntamed colts, &amp; vnweaned
heyfers. Or if they doe all theſe three,
heare, vnderſtand, obey, can they abyde
to be rebuked to their faces of their ſins?
<pb facs="tcp:13120:12"/>
Beholde yet they are like Herode, who
performed the 3 firſt,<note place="margin">Mark. 6.</note> but could not abide
the fourth. Doe they loue the bringers of
this woorde? beholde yet there is in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland
an Adders broode, a generation of
Vipers. Doe they abide and ſtand faſt to
their profeſſion? Beholde yet they are
ſtarting aſide like a broke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> bowe, they are
yet like the children of Ephraim, who be
yng harneſſed, and carrying bowes, did
turne themſelues back in the day of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel.
Nay doe the biſhops and miniſters ſo
goe in, and ſo goe out, before the people
of God, that the people ſeeyng them goe
before, doe follow after them, whereby
our father in heauen is glorified? Behold
yet many of them are like the eye, which
ſeeth all thinges and cannot ſee it ſelfe:
like the whetſtone which maketh the y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
ſharpe, but dull it ſelfe: like the
yron and flint, which make fire in the
tynder but are colde themſelues. I pray
GOD they bee not like thoſe fooliſhe
Carpenters in the dayes of Noah, who
buylded the Arke for Noah<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but they
themſelues were drowned. Or if the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
and people doe ſeeme to liue as
<pb facs="tcp:13120:12" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they teach and are taught, doe they liue
ſo ſincerely, purely, and truely? I pray
God we be not found to bee ſtage play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
to be painted ſepulchers, Wels with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
water, and cloudes without rayne.
For ſo rype is the hypocriſie of men in
theſe dayes, that they which beare the
fayreſt ſhew of godlineſſe, doe moſt deny
the power thereof. For euen they, theſe
holy men, or rather holow trees (I would
they were holie trees, which are alwayes
greene,) are like the faire redd morning,
which bringeth rayne at noone: Like the
calme water, which is moſt deepe: like
the greene graſſe, where the venemous
ſnake lieth, and the filthy curre maketh
his vrine. For they ſerue their bellies,
their fleſh, the world, and in heart doe la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor
for that meat only, which periſheth.
We care not for our liues, our ſoules, our
ſelues, we are inferiour to bruite beaſtes.
Heare o heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, &amp; harken o earth: (ſaith

That we ought not to labour for meate
which doth periſh, wherevnto, nowe I
come. In the beginning the Lorde God
tooke the man, &amp; put him into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of Eden, that he might keepe it and
dreſſe it:<note place="margin">We ought not to labour for this meat.</note> wherevpon as Peter Lombard
noteth, that man was made out of Para<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>diſe,
and afterwarde put into it, both
to ſignifie that he ſhould not long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue

vnto him by grace, and not by

doeth ſo deteſt and abhorre idleneſſe,
that though then there was no neede of
labour,<note place="margin">Lib. 2. diſt. 17.</note> yet hee woulde haue Adam
there, not onely a keeper, but a dreſſer

            <p>

For although at the firſt God made
euery plant of the fielde,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.</note> before it was in
the earth, and euery herbe of the fielde,
it grewe: (for the Lord had not cauſed it
to rayne vppon the earth, neyther was
there a man founde to till the grounde)
yet afterward God would haue the man
to keepe, labour, dreſſe and trimme the
garden, not in the ſweate of his face, not
in paine, not in ſorrowe, but in mirth, ioy,

<pb facs="tcp:13120:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and care not for the meate of the ſoule
as the Athiſtes doe, which ſaye in their

knowing the nature of man, aboue al o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

way to enter againe into Paradiſe, and to

But what cauſed Euah to eate of it? that
which doeth cauſe vs all too labour for
that meate which periſheth. <hi>Nitimur in

are forbidden to doe: it was a fruite too

let vs call to remenbrance the times of

while the fleſhe was betweene their

ſcholers made the feaſts but their frends
then aſſembled, I come a litle nearer to

feaſte and a greate aſſemblie in this
Citie, not of Herode and his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiours,
but of many right noble perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages,
when the Lord of late ſhooke not
London, not Englande onely, but
the moſt part of Europe with a terrible
earthquake? the earth at that time did
ſhake, and we for a time did quake, the
Lord ſhake the heartes of al engliſhmen:
What ſhall I ſay of theſe: they are (no
doubt) examples for vs, that in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
of our feaſting, we ſet not our minds
on our bellies, but remember our God
&amp; think on that meate, which endureth

we come to the marriage of the greate
kinges ſonne: the Lord graunt wee may
leaue our farmes, forſake our oxen, and
not ſuffer our wiues to make vs ſay I can

that feaſt with the prodigall ſonne: the

<pb facs="tcp:13120:20"/>
father I haue ſinned agaynſt heauen, and

haue la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ps, that our la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ps may haue oyle,
and that our oyle may burne. Man bee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
his fall,<note place="margin">De ieiunio.</note> might onely eate of the fruit
of trees, (as Tertullian noteth) afterwarde
the vſe of corne was lawefull for him,
<hi>conditionem conſciencie, ipſo ſitu corporis

mans concience being right and vpright
he looked vp towarde heauen, and pluck
the fruite of trees: but when the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of man was by ſinne caſt downe,
man turned his eyes toward, the ground
and made the graine of corne to bee his
meate, and ſo after the floode, not onely
fruite, not onely corne, but fleſhe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
lawfull. The Lorde did alwayes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide
according to the times and ſeaſons
and ages of mankind, ſufficient and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenient
foode, Nay beholde the Lorde
feedeth the young rauens that call on
him: the foules of the heauen ſowe not,
<pb facs="tcp:13120:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>

yet they are fed,<note place="margin">Pſal. 147.</note> and by our heauenly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Solomon in all his royaltie was not clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed
like one of them. Thus then will
I reaſon: hath God care for beaſtes too
feede them, and for flowers too cloth
them, and will he not much more feede
and cloth vs? are they fedd and clothed
without ſowing, without reaping, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
carying, without ſpinning and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring,
and ſhall not wee bee clothed
and fed, if wee ſowe, reape, cary, ſpinne,
and labour? Will God care for my ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?
then much more for my body,
will he care for my bodie? then muche
more for my life. For the life is more
woorth then meate, and the bodie more
woorth then rayment. I will then care
neither for cloth, nor foode, nor bodie,
nor life, but I will firſt ſeeke the kingdom
of God, and the righteouſnes thereof,
and then I am fully aſſured, that all theſe
thinges ſhalbe miniſtred vnto me, thou

that appoynteth the Moone for certain
ſeaſons, and by him the ſunne knoweth

hee onely maketh the vallies ſo full of

Doeſt thou brag of thy blood, thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors,
thy houſe &amp; ſtock? thy maiſter
came as of a pure, ſo of a poore virgine
eſpouſed to a poore carpenter, who for
lack of mony could haue no roome in
the Inne, who did offer to the Lorde a
paire of Pigeons, becauſe he was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to buy a lamb. Ierome noteth, that
only poore &amp; ſinfull women are named
by S. Math. in the genelogie of Chriſt,
as Ruth a poore Moabitis,<note place="margin">Ierom.</note> &amp; pore Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

Chriſt did vouchſafe to come of poore

pore ſinful perſons, doeſt thou brag of
the countrye Adam was made out of
Paradice, and Euah in Paradice, yet the
Diuell hadde more power ouer her

then ouer him: they had both one name
Adam,<note place="margin">Gen. 5.</note> reed earth: for this name, Adam
was not giuen by God only to the man,
but alſo to the woman. Thy maiſter was
not borne in Ieruſalem, whither the wiſe
men came, but in little Bethlehem, as it
was propheſied. Doeſt thou glory in
thy houſes, buildings, courtes, pallaces?
Thy maiſter was borne in a manger, the
foxes haue holes, and the birdes haue
neſtes, but the ſonne of man thy Lorde
had no where to reſt his heade on. Doeſt
thou boaſt of thy bagges, thy coffers, thy
welth? When thy maiſter woulde haue
payed tribute, Iudas bagge was emptie,
Peter muſt run and fetch a peece of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie
in the mouth of a fiſhe. Doeſt thou
deſire to be well ſpoken of, to haue the
good will of the world? There were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
iii. diuerſe opinions of Chriſt: one,
which fleſh and blood could not reueale
that he was Chriſt the ſonne of God, an
other of ignorance, that he was Elias,
Ieremie, Iohn Baptiſt, or one of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets:
the third was of mallice, that hee
was a glutton, a drunkard, a bon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
a friend to Publicans and ſinners
<pb facs="tcp:13120:24" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a coniurer, a woorker by Diuels. But

the weake too confounde the ſtronger.
Why? that no fleſh ſhould reioyce in his
preſence. What then? that he that reioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth,
ſhould reioyce in the Lord. Whom
did the Lord chooſe for a captaine? No

who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made he ruler ouer Pharaos houſe?
none of the nobles, but Ioſeph a bonde
ſerua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> made hee the firſt king of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da?
not any of a great houſe, but Saule of
the little tribe of Gemini, and of the
leaſt familie in the tribe. Whom made
hee to rule his people after Saule? no
<pb facs="tcp:13120:26"/>
Prince, but Dauid a ſhephearde: whom
had he to be his Prophet? None of their
Doctors, but Amos an heardman. Who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
had Chriſt to his diſciples? No ſcribes,
but ſimple fiſhers. Many widowes were
in Iſrael in the dayes of Elias, to none of
them was he ſent, but to a poore widowe
in Sarepta. To whom was the newes of
Chriſt his birth firſt brought? not to He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode,
not to Pilate, not Annas or Caiphas
but to ſhepheardes, yea, and very poore
ſhepheards, for they kept their ſheepe in
the field all night. God woulde not haue
his Altar made in a kinges court, but in
poore Oruan his threſhing flowre: the
Lorde would not haue his temple in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrata,
a plentiful ſoyle but in the wood,
a barren wilderneſſe. This was done that
God might haue al the glory. Of Sara be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

with whom it had ceaſed to be after

And this was done, that GOD might

a iawe bone of an aſſe, with one ſword,
with a ſtone out of a ſling, and this was
done that GOD might haue all the
glorie. Diſeaſes were healed by ſpittle,
by touching the hemme of a garment,
by a napkin, by a ſhadow, and this was
doone that GOD might haue all the
glorie.</p>
            <p>For there was no vertue in <hi>Shamgars</hi>
oxe goade, nor in Ionathans ſworde, nor
in Sampſons Iawe bone, nor in Dauids
ſtone, wherewith they ouercame the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtines:
no vertue in Gedeons pitchers,
wherewith he ouercame Oreb and Zeb:
no power in the Trumpets of Rammes
hornes, wherewith the walles of Iericho
fell downe: there was no vertue eyther
in the hem of Chriſtes garment, or in his
ſpittle or in Paules napkin, or in Peters
ſhadowe, wherewith diſeaſes were cured:
no vertue in Aarons rod, wherewith the
duſt of Egypt was turned into lice: no
power in Moſes hand, wherewith the red

ſimple meanes, that no man ſhould truſt

ſeeke for any meate, that periſheth, and
that God in all things might only haue

excellent names and titles, wherwith the
holy Ghoſt in the holy bible doth name
vs: the remembrance and conſideration
whereof will ſomwhat withdrawe vs
from labouring for that meate, which
periſheth. Wee are called Angelles and
Saintes, Prieſtes, and a kingely prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode.
Kinges, and a royall nation: ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uauntes
of GOD, friendes of God,
ſonnes of God, heyres of GOD, and
fellowe heyres with Ieſus Chriſt: are
wee Angelles and Saintes? let vs then
ſeeke the thinges that are aboue. Are
we Prieſtes, and a kingly Prieſthoode?
let vs then offer vp our bodyes, a liue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſacrifice, and not labour for the meat
thereof. Are we kinges, and a royall
nation? let vs then lift vp our eyes to
heauen, and not caſt our faces down

Are we ſeruantes of God? wee
cannot ſerue God and riches. Are wee

friendes of God? the friendſhippe of

wee were goates, but now we are ſheep:

we were bondſlaues to Satan, but nowe

               <pb facs="tcp:13120:28"/>
We were once fet home, from going
aſtray, let vs not agayne returne to the
wilderneſſe: the candel was once lighted
for vs, let vs not againe fall into darke
holes: wine &amp; oyle were once powred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our woundes, let vs not by wandring,
fal again into hands of theeues. We were
once founde: let vs not agayne looſe our
ſelues. Wee were once made aliue, let vs
not againe kil our ſelues. Chriſt was once
crucified for vs,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.</note> that we ſhould onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioyce
in the croſſe of Ieſus Chriſt, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
the worlde is crucified to vs, and we to
the world, let vs not crucifie to our ſelues
again the ſonne of God, &amp; make a mock
of him. The bodies of thoſe beaſts, whoſe
blood was brought into the holy place
by the hie prieſte for ſinne, were burnt
without the campe: therefore euen Ieſus,
that he might ſa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ctifie the people with his
owne blood, ſuffered without the gate.
What is this to vs? let vs therefore (ſaith
the Apoſtle) goe forth to him out of the
campe, for here haue we no continuyng
citie, but we looke for one to come. Wilt
thou (O man) go forth out of the camp?
Labour not ſo much to prouide meat for

the campe. The workes of the fleſhe are

They that doe ſuch thinges, ſhall neuer
inherit the kingdome of God. The
fruite of the ſpirite is temperancie, and
ſuch like, againſt ſuch there is no lawe:
For they that are Chriſtes, haue crucified
the fleſhe, with the affections, and the

alſo walke in the ſpirit. Woe be to you,

but let vs watch, and be ſober. For they

that bee dronken, are dronken in the

honeſtly, as in the day, not in gluttony

but put on the Lorde Ieſus Chriſt,

Conſider the time: for the day of

Many haue deſired to ſee that we

thoſe thinges that we heare, but could
not heare them. But yet beholde, the
Niniuites, ſhall riſe, and ſhalbe able to

England is not able to render (I

Goe tell them, (if they haue any friende
heere) that thoſe Goates, Wolues, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morantes,
Coltes, Foxes, ſhalbe ſo hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and bayted by an Engliſh Gray, that
not one of them ſhall be left to piſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

lyeth hidden, wee preach to day, yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,
to morow, and will preache, vntill
the houſe of the Lorde bee made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.
God graunt we may ſo doe. This
is our hope, that though the Kinges of
the earth ſtand vp together againſt the
Lorde, and his annoynted ſeruaunt Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth,
though they rore like Lions, and
ſtampe like fatte bulles of Baſhan: yet
the Lorde ſhall bruſe them with a rodde
of yron, and breake them in peeces, like
a potters veſſel. They ſhall bee like water
that runneth a pace, like a ſnaile, like the
vntimely fruite of a woman, lyke a tot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering

ſhal awake out of ſleep, as a giant refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed

(if we repent) that his ſword ſhal ſurfeite
with fleſh, &amp; his arrowes ſhalbe drunken
with blood. Wherefore (O England) I
woulde to God all England hearde my
voyce (&amp; I would my voyce might ſinke
into your hearts, as it doth found in your

worldly pelfe, and to take the bread and

As our Sauiour ſpake to the Iewes
of the Scribes and Phariſies, ſo ſay I to
you of the Papiſtes. Vnleſſe your righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
exceede the righteouſneſſe of
the Scribes and Phariſies, I meane Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtes
and Romaniſtes. You ſhall neuer
enter into the kingdome of GOD.
But alas for pitie, alas for ſhame, are not
many that beare the name of Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantes,
and Goſpellers, inferiour too
them? We vſe our libertie as a cloake
of looſeneſſe, wee turne the grace of
God into wantonneſſe, and the glorious
<pb facs="tcp:13120:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
goſpell of Ieſus Chriſt into lewdneſſe.
Are not wee come from the exceſſe, to
the defect? from blinde zeale, to wilfull
vngodlineſſe? from ignoraunce in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
to wickedneſſe in knoweledge?
from many Gods, to noe God? from
papiſme, to Athiſme? from ſuperſtition,
to irreligion? they did faſt often, we ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome:
they came to the Church in the
night, we ſcarſe in the day: they gaue
almes, we liue to our ſelues. I condemne
not al, I ſpeake of many. Did the Papſtes
theſe things for merit, for deſert, for ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>faction,
&amp; ſhould not we doe them of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
of pittie, of pietie and charitie? They
did <hi>bona,</hi> but not <hi>bene:</hi> good things, but
to an ill ende. We now know what is <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne,</hi>
let vs doe <hi>bona.</hi> Did they theſe things
in darknes? ſhould not wee doe them in
light? they in the night, &amp; not we in the
day? they in blindnes, not we in knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge?
they in ſuperſtition, &amp; not we in
religion? they to an ill end, &amp; not we to a
good end? they at the commaundement
of man, of the Pope: not wee at the
commaundement of God, of Chriſte?
Nay, this is the ſaying of the worlde:
<pb facs="tcp:13120:34"/>
Doeth he frequent the Church? he is an
hypocrite: doeth he faſt? he wilbe ſaued
by his workes. Doth he giue almes? he is
a Papiſt. O miſerable worlde, wherein
prayer is counted hypocriſie: zeale is
counted folly: faſting and almes deedes
are counted poperie. But what is the
cauſe of this? becauſe we all labour for
that meate which periſheth. Do not the
Papiſts call vs looſe libertines, carnall
Goſpellers, wanton Epicures? doe not
they in their motions make this an
argument, to proue that they haue the
true Church? becauſe they faſt, praye,
giue almes more then wee: becauſe by
Papiſts, colledges haue beene founded,
churches erected, ſcholes builded, and
almes houſes ſet vp, and maintained: O
happy were we (for great ſhould our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde

Chriſt onely we were euil ſpoken of: but
if we contemne prayer, deſpiſe faſting,
abhorre almes deedes, pull from chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,
defraud the miniſters, throw down
almes houſes, gape after colledge lands,
pluck at their formes (as it is too true in

againſt Daniell, ſpeaking againſt Bell?
was it for loue and zeale they bare to
Bell? no, no: there was ſpent vpon Bell
euery night 108. gallons of fine flowre,
40. ſheepe, and 60. gallons of wine. The
Prieſtes ſhould haue loſt this, if Bell had

I would all Magiſtrates, and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trones
of benefices would folow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of good king Ezechias, who in the
firſt yeeare, yea, the firſt moneth of his
reigne, did command the people to giue
a part to the Prieſtes &amp; Leuites, that they
might be encouraged in the lawe of the
Lorde. Liuinges are not geuen, they are
ſolde as common as oyſters at Byllinges<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.
This is the cauſe that Miniſters are
not, nor cannot be ſo liberal, as their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors
haue been: yea, this is the cauſe
why doltes, ignorant Aſſes, idle, &amp; idole
Shepheardes haue the liuinges. I call the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
Idols: I wil proue it. They haue eyes and
ſee not, eares and heare not, handes and
miniſter not, tongues and ſpeake not: I
was about to ſay, they haue mouthes &amp;
eate not, but then I ſhoulde haue ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
them: In this I confeſſe they are
<pb facs="tcp:13120:37"/>
not Idols. A good ſcholer, and an honeſt
godlie miniſter, will rather beg, then buy
your liuinges, O yee robbe Churches,
whoſe portion ſhalbe fire and brimſtone
too drinke: for you are the cauſes, why
many thouſands of ſoules haue periſhed:
of you, O the benefice mongers, ſhall be
required, not hand, for hand, or eye for
eye: but blood for blood, life for life,
and ſoule for ſoule. You make the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters
your ſeruing men, you make them
iourney men, they haue the name, you
haue the profite, they the ſtraw, but you
haue the corne, nay you haue ſome ſtraw
alſo. I could ſomwhat beare this, if here
by, they for whom Chriſt died, were not
famiſhed: therefore in bitterneſſe of
ſpirite, in griefe of hearte, in vexation of
conſcience, and in torment of my ſoule,
I ſpeake it: that euen nowe I doe ſee

Hadd hee ſuche care for Idolatrous
<pb facs="tcp:13120:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Prieſtes, and haue you no more care for
the Miniſters of Ieſus Chriſt? Are you
Proteſtantes, you Goſpellers, you Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians?
You are Athiſtes, Epicures,
that ſay in your hearts there is no God.
But perhaps fewe are heere of whom
I ſpeake: let me vtter a few words to you
merchant men, whom I ſee preſent, and
ſo I will end. Although Mercurie, (who
was ſuppoſed to bee the God of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,)
had winges on his feet, and had
alwayes a cocke by his ſide, to ſignifie
that merchantes ſhoulde be ſwift in their
buſineſſe, ſhould be vigilant as the cock,
or riſe at the cocke crowing: yet labour
not to greedily, to carefully for this meat
for as the good hath in one hand a ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to giue kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, wealth, &amp; riches: ſo
he is pictured to haue in his other hand
a rod wrapt in ſnaks, to giue poyſon, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
and death: beware, leaſt while you
gape for the ſcepter, you receiue ſnakes.
And although your GOD is ſaide to
haue kylled Argos, who had a hundred
eies: leaſt Argos ſhoulde perceiue the
vniuſt dealying of the Merchauntes,
yet the Lorde your GOD lyueth,
<pb facs="tcp:13120:38"/>
who ſearcheth the corners, ſeeth the
bottome, heareth the motions, and
vnderſtandeth the thoughtes of your
heartes. But what ſayeth the Prophet?
All men ſhoulde prayſe the Lorde, but
aboue all other, merchantes are bound
to performe the ſame. For (ſayeth hee)
they that goe downe to the Sea in ſhips,<note place="margin">Pſal. 107.</note>
and occupie their buſineſſe in greate
waters, theſe men ſee the woorkes of
the Lord, and his woonders in the deepe.
And when there hee hath fully deſcribed
the woonders and woorkes of the Lorde
that they ſee, hee thus concludeth with
a vehement exhortation: O that men
woulde therefore prayſe the Lorde for
his goodneſſe, and declare the woon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
that hee hath done for the ſonnes
of men. Twoo thinges are required of
you (O yee Merchauntes) to prayſe the
Lorde, and too declare his woonders,
that you haue ſeene. vnto others. For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
not the Lorde by goyng too your
ſhippes: Remember the ſhippe that Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas
was in. Beware howe you haue fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhippe
with heathen men, with Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,
<pb facs="tcp:13120:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Athiſtes, and Papiſtes: becauſe Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſophat
king of Iuda,<note place="margin">2. Chro. 20.</note> ioyned with Aha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ziah
king of Iſrael, to ſende ſhippes too
Tarſhiſh for gold, he was reprehended by
Eliezer, and his ſhippes were broken.
Take Chriſte into your ſhippes: when
Chriſt was not in the ſhippe with his
Diſciples, the ſhippe was almoſt drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
If Chriſt be in your ſhippe, let him
not ſleepe there: when he ſlept, the ſhipp
had almoſt periſhed. Keepe him waking
with prayer: ſinging with melodie in
your heartes too the Lorde. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
labour not for the meate which
periſheth: for then you ſhall periſh, but
labour for that meate which doth en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure
vnto euerlaſting life: for then the
ſonne of man ſhall geue you euerlaſting
life: for hee is a Lambe, and hee is a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:

is a Ieſus, hee is a iudge, he is a Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,

Wherefore as our Sauiour reprehended
Martha,<note place="margin">Luke. 10.</note> beeing carefull about many
things, in preparing the dinner, not ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
reprehending eyther her labour, as
her hoſpitalitie, but reprehended her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
ſhe did not conſider the time, wher
in Chriſt taught Mary, and offered too

dreſſing of the dinner, to the hearing of
Gods woord, and afterwarde exhorted
her too followe the example of her ſiſter
Mary, who had choſen the better parte,
which neuer ſhould bee taken from her.
So after that I haue proued that we ſhuld
not labour for the meat which periſheth,

which endureth vnto euerlaſting life. For
although the Lord did raine fleſh as thick

place? whatſoeuer pertaineth to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing
and amendment of this life, or to
<pb facs="tcp:13120:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The chiefeſt part wherof, is that, which
is hid from the wiſe and mightie of the
worlde, that which is receiued of the
poore and ſimple, that which is the
power of God vnto ſaluation, to euery
one that beleeueth the glorious Goſpel
of Ieſus Chriſt: and becauſe meat doth
not nouriſh a dead carcaſſe, we muſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
for fayth, the life of the ſoule: and
becauſe this meate cannot bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
in our ſoules, without the effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
operation of Gods ſpirit, we muſt
thirdly labour for the holy Ghoſt: who
is promiſed to be giuen to all them that
in a right and true prayer ſhall aske for
him of the Father in the name of the
ſonne, although hee deſcend not like a
doue,<note place="margin">Mat. 3.</note> as vpon our Sauiour, nor in the
forme of clouen and fierie tongues,<note place="margin">Act. 2.</note> as
vpon the Apoſtles. He is now to be ſent
not to be ſeen of our bodily eies: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our harts, where he cryeth, Abba, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as the Apoſtle ſaith: becauſe we are
ſonnes,<note place="margin">Gala. 4.</note> God hath ſent forth the ſpirite
of his ſonne, into our heartes, which
cryeth, Abba, father. It is a true ſaying,
<hi>Bona magis carendo,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Cicero.</note> 
               <hi>quam fruendo ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:13120:45"/>
We better perceiue and feele the
commoditie of a thing, when we lacke
it, then when we haue it. For who doth
better conſider the benefit of the warm
fire, then he that is froſen with colde?
who doeth better thinke on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditie
of libertie, then the pryſoner?
who doeth better remember the vſe of
apparell, then he which is naked? who
doeth more eſteeme of meate, then hee
that is almoſt famiſhed? for after a
long colde winter, a little ſun ſhining is
fayre weather: after great ſorowe, one
dayes pleaſure is a paradiſe: after a long
bloody warre, a little peace is a merye
world: and after long hunger, browne
bread is good cheare.</p>
            <p>Now if wee could eyther thinke on
their extreame miſerie, who like the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of Canaan, like hungry dogs would
gladly picke vp the crummes, that fall
from our table, and can haue no more
of them, then the prodigall ſonne had
of the ſwines huskes: or at leaſt woulde
call to minde our owne miſerable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,
when like poore Lazarus, wee lay
<pb facs="tcp:13120:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
begging at the rich mans gate, dogges
hauing more mercy then men, and wee
no more ſatiſfied then Tantalus with his
apples. We would no doubt labour to
obtaine by Chriſt,<note place="margin">Mat. 8.</note> not houſes, or liuings
as that Scribe:<note place="margin">Mat. 20.</note> not to bee Lordes and
Dukes, as Iames and Iohn: not to haue
belly cheare, as in this place the Iewes
did: but for the meate of the ſoule,
which endureth vnto euerlaſting lyfe.
But what was our famine, how were
we vſed, or rather abuſed? Sower lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
was put to our ſweete bread: Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quintida
was caſt into our potage: chaf
thrown among our wheate: ſand ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with our dough: amongſt our gold
there was droſſe: wee had water for
wine: braſſe for ſiluer: the cuppe of the
whore, for the cup of the Lord: worme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woode,
for hony: gall for Manna: the
legende, for the Goſpell: wolues, for
ſhepheards: the inuentions of man, for
the commaundementes of God: man
for God: Antichriſt, for Chriſt: the ſon
of perdition, for the ſonne of GOD.</p>
            <p>Agayne, the worde was deliuered vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:13120:46"/>
vs in a ſtraunge tongue: that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
we could tel how to daunce, when
they blewe the pipe, nor how to behaue
our ſelues in battaile, when they did
ſound the trumpet:<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.</note> neither the vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
was bettered, nor the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
edified, nor the vnlearned, at
the giuing of thanks, coulde ſay Amen:
but they were Barbarians to vs, and we
Barbarians to them.</p>
            <p>Furthermore, the common people
might not reade the worde, they might
not once taſte of that heauenly foode,
vnleſſe the Prieſtes had firſt chewed it in
their own mouths: whoſe mouths were
full of bitterneſſe, whoſe throates were
open ſepulchres, whoſe teeth were ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous,
whoſe tongues were ful of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite,
vnder whoſe lippes was the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of aſpes: who did eate vp the Lords
people as bread, whoſe feete were ſwift
to ſhedde the blood of Saints, but right
deare in the ſight of the Lorde is the
death of his Saintes.</p>
            <p>But why might not the people reade
the word, taſte this meate? they (for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſooth)
gathered damnable errours, and
<pb facs="tcp:13120:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſucked out thence deadly poyſon. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

they offered ſtraunge fire, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned:
who becauſe they offered not
that fire, which came from heauen, but
ſtraunge fire, were deuoured of fire. An
euerlaſting fire is reſerued for thoſe,<note place="margin">Leuit. 10.</note>
which haue troaden vnder foote the
doctrin that came from heauen, &amp; haue
brought in ſtraung doctrine, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
was in heauen. As that fire, ſo this
meate came from heauen: in this they
differ, that fire endured onely to the
captiuitie of Babylon: but this meat en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth
vnto euerlaſting life. Wherfore,
though Peter, or Paule: though Gabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,<note place="margin">Gala. 10.</note>
or Michael, Cherubim, or Seraphim,
teach any other thing, the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that we haue
receiued of the Lord, who came downe
from heauen, and brought this meate
<pb facs="tcp:13120:47" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from heauen, let him be accurſed: as I
ſaid before, ſo I ſay again: if any of theſe
bring any thing beſides that, which we
haue receiued of the Lord, let them, and
euery one of them, be accurſed. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
I anſwer, that though the ſpider doe
gather poyſon, where the Bee doth ſuck
hony, yet there is no poiſon in the ſweet
flower, but the corrupt humour that is
in the ſpyder, doth turne the ſweet iuyce
into poiſon: ſo there are no errours, nor
hereſies in the word of god, but the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
&amp; venomous nature of man, doth
turn the comfortable ſap of Gods word
into deadly poyſon. Now, if the ſpyder
gather poyſon, let not therfore the Bee
be driuen from the flowers: though the
ſons of Satan, doe gather errours, and
ſuck that which vnto them is poiſon: yet
let not therfore the children of GOD,
be forbidden to ſucke mylke, which
ſhall ſaue their ſoules. Chriſt is put both
for the fall, and alſo for the ryſing, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne
of many in Iſraell:<note place="margin">Luke. 2.</note> he is a rock
to buylde on,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.</note> and hee is a ſtone that
will grind to powder:<note place="margin">Mat. 21.</note> if the Goſpell be
hid, it is hid to them that are loſt, it is
<pb facs="tcp:13120:48"/>
vnto ſome the ſauour of death,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.</note> vnto
death, to other ſome the ſauour of life
vnto lyfe. It is not giuen to them to
knowe the miſteries:<note place="margin">Mat. 13.</note> who are they, to
whom it is not giuen? it followeth, that
people, whoſe heart is waxed fat, whoſe
eares are dull of hearing, who winke
with their eies, leaſt with their eies they
ſhoulde ſee, and heare with their eares,
and vnderſtand with their heartes, and
ſhould returne, that I might heale them.
The Goſpell (ſaieth Paule) is the miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
hid ſince the world began, and from
all ages, but nowe is made manifeſt to
the Saintes of God, to whom GOD
would make knowne what is the riches
of his glorious miſterie among the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.
Dogs muſt not haue that which is
holy. There is a dogge, which turneth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout,
and teareth them that doe offer
holy thinges. Let not this dogge receiue
that holy thing. There is a dogge, that
cryeth with the woeman of Canaan,
trueth Lord, I confeſſe, that I am a dog,
yet the whelps may gather vp the crums
that fal fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s table: Chriſt wil
haue that holy thing to be giuen to this
<pb facs="tcp:13120:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
dog. Caſt not pearls before ſwin. Truth,
if they bee foule, and treade them vnder
their feete, or if they bee waſht, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne
backe too their wallowing in the
myre. But if wee which were ſwine, are
by the blood of Chriſte waſhed, and by
the water of regeneration ſanctified, &amp;
of ſwine are made lambes, let vs haue
that pearl, we wil not tread it vnder our
feete. One Goſpell, yet diuerſly it wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
in diuers mens heartes. Water wil
harden yron, and ſoften the earth. The
Sunne drieth clay, and melteth waxe:
the ſeede in good grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, bringeth forth
increaſe: but ſowed among ſtones or
thornes, it bringeth foorth no fruit. The
fault is not in the ſeede, but in the ſoyle:
the Sunne to vs that haue cleare ſight is
comfortable: to the man that is pore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blinde,
it is hurtfull. Blame not the
Sunne but the foole that will turne his
eyes towardes the Sunne. Suger to vs
that bee in health is ſweete: to the ſicke
of an Ague it is bitter: the Suger is not
bitter, his taſt is naught. Daintie meates
to ſome ſtomackes are wholeſome, to
others they are fulſome, the fault is not
<pb facs="tcp:13120:49"/>
in the meate, but in the ſtomacke. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
ſo Chriſte crucified, is to the Iewe
a ſtumbling blocke,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> to the Grecian fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhneſſe:
but to them that are called, he
is the power of God, and the wiſedome
of God: bee they Iew or Grecian, bond
or free, male or female. Wherefore,
thirdly I anſwere: though drunkardes
and toſſe pottes abuſe wine, yet wine is
profitable: though vſurers and coueto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us
men abuſe money, yet money is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary:
though cutters and ſwinge-bucklers
abuſe weapons, yet weapons
are needfull. Right ſo, though the word
of God by Heretikes, and Athiſtes bee
abuſed, yet it is not to be forbidden. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it giueth wiſedome euen vnto the
ſimple:<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.</note> becauſe it hath milke for babes,

our oyle, to augment our loaues,
we ſhall haue no neede of his meale, to

if we haue this pearle, we ſhal

and I ſpeake vnto you, as ſometyme
Naamans ſeruant ſpake vnto him, when
he refuſed to waſh himſelfe ſeuen times

thus ſayde: are not Abanah, and
Pharapar ryuers of Damaſcus better
then all the waters of Iſraell? May not
I waſh me in them, and be healed? but
this man ſayde: if the Prophet had
commaunded thee a great thing, woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
thou not haue done it? how much
rather then, when he ſaith to thee, waſh
and be cleane? you are bidden to come

heauen. Doe not many ſay, there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
meates at Rome, other waters at
Rome, better then all the meate and

I ſay vnto you: if the Lord ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund
you to doe a great thing, ought
ye not to doe it? How much more then,
when he ſayth, labour for the meate,
which endureth vnto euerlaſting lyfe,
which I the ſonne of man will giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

and finde: knock, and it ſhall be ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.
Let vs aske, let vs ſeek, let vs knock,
let vs labour for this meate. Labour for
this meate, O you people, and pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Lord, that his Miniſters put their
candell on a candelſticke with chereful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
and not vnder a buſhell: labour for
this money, and pray vnto the Lorde,
that his merchantes may occupy with

to hyde it in the grounde: labour for
this ſeede, and pray vnto the Lord, that
his huſbandmen may ſowe it with pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe,

Labour for this meate, and pray vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:13120:60"/>
the Lord, that his Stewards may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
it with bountifulnes, and not

but we wil doe whatſoeuer thing goeth
out of our mouth, as to burne incenſe
to the Queene of heauen, and to purge
out drink offrings vnto her, as we haue
don, both we, and our fathers, our kings
and our princes, for then had we plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of victuall, and were well, and felt no
euil. Are not theſe the ſayings of the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maniſts,
and Papiſts? firſt to graunt, that
we haue the word of GOD: ſecondly,
to ſay, we will not ſo much as heare it:
thirdly, to follow their own inuentions.
Againe, are not theſe their arguments?
firſt of cuſtome wee haue done ſo, and
<pb facs="tcp:13120:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
our fathers: ſecondly of a generalitie:
not we onely, but our fathers, our Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
and al haue done ſo? thirdly of their
belly, then we had plentie of victuall,
and felt no euill? and to whome would
they offer their ſacrifice? not to God,
but as the Papiſtes doe, to the Queene
of heauen. Aske the Papiſtes, how they
prooue their religion to be the trueth,
and they will drawe their argumentes
from antiquitie, from cuſtome, from v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerſalitie,
and from the belly, as did
the Iewes in the dayes of Ieremy. Nay,
hath not the deuill rayſed vp Iehoiakim
from the dead, to burne the wordes,
that Baruch had out of the mouth of
Ieremy,<note place="margin">Iere. 36.</note> and Antiochus, to burne the

came home from Babila, they buylded
the temple of the Lorde, before they
builded eyther their own houſes,<note place="margin">1. Eſdr. 3.</note> or the

hand, hauing weapons in the other. All
the people followed Dauid, to ſeek the

to builde a temple vnto the Lord.
How did the Iewes deſire and loue this
meate,<note place="margin">2. Eſdr. 8.</note> when they heard Eſdras read the

bitterly. How did the people of Antioch
<pb facs="tcp:13120:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
labour, when the rulers of the ſinagogue

When they beſought Paule to preache

the nexte ſabboth daye, the whole

            <p>How did Cornelius labour? when he

Iohn Baptiſt brought his Diſciples to

wil raiſe vp cunning workmen for his te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

<pb facs="tcp:13120:62"/>
of his people, as when Moſes made
the Arke,<note place="margin">Exod. 31.</note> he called Bezaleel by name:
and when Soloman built the temple, he
rayſed vp Hyram of Tyrus, whome he
filled with his ſpirit, to work in timber,
ſiluer, braſſe and golde. But it is not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to vs, how the Popes ſhauelings,
and that fat Prieſt of Rome himſelfe,<note place="margin">Nehem. 4.</note> do

Some come to vs, as the men of Samaria

you, for we ſeeke the Lord your God, as
you do. But he anſwered, &amp; ſo doe we, it
is not for you, it is for vs to builde the

ſpeake good wordes to the people, but
as Abſolon, to ſteale away the hartes of
<pb facs="tcp:13120:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the people from Dauid his father: you

a bottell of hony: though Ahiiah were
blinde, yet he ſayd, come in thou wife of

you bring hony in your mouths, there is
none ſo blind, but he can ſay, come in,
or rather, come out thou ſonne of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt.<note place="margin">Gen. 26.</note>
You vſed vs (and ſo you hope
to doe again) as the Philiſtines vſed Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac,
when they ſtopped, and filled vp with
earth all the welles, which Abraham his
Fathers ſeruantes had digged for him.
<pb facs="tcp:13120:63"/>
The water for a time with earth may be
ſtopped: fire for a time with aſhes may
be couered: the ſonne for a time with
clowdes may be ſhadowed: but now
(the Lord be thanked) the erth is remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued,
and the water doeth runne: the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes
are conſumed, and the fire doeth
burne: the clowdes are diſperſed, &amp; the
ſun doth ſhine. Now that we may long
enioy theſe benefits, the Lord continue,
&amp; encreaſe the zeale of our ſoureigne,
that ſhee neuer ſet her minde on that
meat, which periſheth, not on any erth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
thing, as did good king Dauid, when
hee numbred the people, as did good
king Ezechias, when he bragged of his
treaſure to the Ambaſſadours of the
king of Babell:<note place="margin">2. Sam. 24.</note> but to continue in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining

who did well all the dayes of Iehoida
the Prieſt,<note place="margin">2. Chron. 23.</note> and afterwarde fell from the

God as long as Zachariah the Prophet
liued, and afterward forſooke God: but
that as her dayes may be as the dayes of
heauen, ſo to her liues ende, ſhee may
labour for to keep among vs this meat
<pb facs="tcp:13120:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of our ſoules, for this meat hath no end,
but endureth vnto euerlaſting life. That
ſhe may ſtill haue before her eies the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Dauid, who before all thinges
did ſeeke the Arke of the Lord, &amp; would
haue builte an houſe for his God, and
though he were forbidden, becauſe hee
was a man of blood, yet hee prouided
timber and ſtone, and commaunded
Solomon his ſonne to builde it. That So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon
may bee in her remembraunce,
who builte the houſe of God, before he
built his owne courte.<note place="margin">1. Reg. 6</note> The houſe of
God was 7. yeeres in buylding, but his
owne was thirteene yeeres: not that he
beſtowed more charges on his owne
houſe,<note place="margin">2. Reg. 18.</note> but with more haſt and ſpeede he
did builde a temple vnto the Lord. That
ſhe neuer ceaſe to follow Ezechias, who
firſt of all brake the Images, cut downe
the groues, and brake in peeces the bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
ſerpent, that Moſes had ſet vp: that
ſhe thinke alwayes on Ioſiah, who being
a childe, beganne to ſeeke after the God
of Dauid his father,<note place="margin">2. Chron. 34.</note> and did purge Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem
and Iudah: that ſhe may alwayes
<pb facs="tcp:13120:64"/>
thinke on the commaundement of the
Lorde: when the kinge ſhall ſitte in the
throne of his kingdome,<note place="margin">Deut. 17.</note> then he ſhall
write him this lawe in a booke repeated
by the prieſtes: it ſhalbe with him, and
he ſhall reade therein al the dayes of his
life, that he may learn to feare the Lord,
his god, &amp; keep al the words of this law,
and theſe ordinaunces for to doe them.
Now, for as much as meat doeth not
nouriſh, vnles it be receiued, &amp; by fayth
we receiue it:<note place="margin">Fayth.</note> it cannot cheriſh vs, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe

by fayth we retaine it: it doth no good,
vnleſſe we haue life, and the iuſt ſhall
liue by fayth. It is very neceſſarie, that
we labour for fayth, whereby we may
perfectly be nouriſhed, and well fedde
with this meate: there is nothing that
the deuill deſireth more, then to haue
fayth out of our heartes: therefore
hee planted vnbeliefe in the heartes
of Adam and Eue: for vnbeliefe they

called the ſonne of God: Chriſte was
conceaued in her, therefore his body
came not from heauen: Chriſte was
borne of her, therfore his body was not
made of nothing. Secondly, he doth cal <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
himſelfe the ſonne of ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, ſignifiyng that
he was ſubiect to al infirmitity that hap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
to man, ſin only excepted. For he was
<pb facs="tcp:13120:68"/>

<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> blood, he ſuffered the moſt vile and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious

Laſtly, hee calleth himſelfe the ſonne of
man, as though he were acounted the
vileſt man in the worlde. Beholde I who
was borne in a ſtall, laide in a manger,
poore, needy, contemned, whome they
call the Carpenter, and the Carpenters
ſonne: beholde I the ſonne of man, will
giue euerlaſting life vnto you.</p>
            <p>Nowe if the ſonne of man doth giue
euerlaſting life, howe is it that he made
this anſwere to Iames and Iohn,<note place="margin">Matth: 20.</note> to ſit at
my right hande, and at my left hande is
not mine to giue, but it ſhall bee giuen
to them, for whom it is prepared of my

of my father,<note place="margin">Matth. 25.</note> inioy you the kindome
of my father, He ſaith not my bleſſed,
nor my kingdome, but bleſſed of my
father, and the kingdome of my father,
and in the fifth of Iohn,<note place="margin">Io. 5.</note> hee ſaide: I can
doe nothing of my ſelfe. Wherfore if he
cannot giue to ſit at his right, or left
hande, if the kingdome bee not his,
<pb facs="tcp:13120:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if he can doe nothing of himſelfe, how
doth he heare promiſe euerlaſting life?
he ſaieth bleſſed of my father, the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of my Father, I can doe nothing
of my ſelfe, becauſe he woulde, as man
giue to the father all the glory. My fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
hath appoynted theſe thinges to
giue before the beginning of the world,
I am not now to beſtow the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, they ſhalbe
giuen to them, for whom it is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
of my father.<note place="margin">Io. 1.</note> But yet this is true: as
many as receiued him, to them he gaue
prerogatiue to be the ſonnes of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
to them that beleeue in his name.
We are ſonnes by nature, ſo we are the
ſonnes of Adam: we are ſonnes by diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline,
ſo we are the ſonnes of Chriſt, we
are ſonnes by adoption, and ſo we are
brothers to Chriſt, and ſonnes of God.
Heare doe the Papiſts gather, that euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting

whatſoeuer we haue of gift, that is not
of merit. They are oppoſite, as Paule
ſaieth. By grace you are ſaued through
fayth, and that not of your ſelues, it is
the gift of God: yea, by euill workes
we deſerue death, and by good workes
we deſerue life: according to the Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma
of the Logicians. But if I followe
Paule, I muſt deny the argument: for
the wages of ſinne is death,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> but the gift
of God is euerlaſting lyfe, through Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus
Chriſt our Lord. Moſes did ſhewe
vnto the Iewes the lande of promyſe,
but hee could not bring them into it,
that was left for Ioſhua: euen ſo the law
is a ſcholemaiſter to bring vs to chriſt,
it cannot purchaſe euerlaſting lyfe, that
is left for Ieſus, whoſe office it is to giue
euerlaſting life: and therfore he was ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
of the Father: and this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation,
taken from the office and
functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Ieſus chriſt:<note place="margin">Confirmation</note> he ſaith of himſelf.
I came not into the world, to iudge the
world, but to ſaue the world. He came
not,<note place="margin">Io. 12.</note> as Herod thought, to put him out
<pb facs="tcp:13120:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of his kingdome: not to giue Duke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes
and Lordſhippes, as Iames and
Iohn thought, not to reſtore the earthly
kingdome to Iſraell, as his Diſciples
thought: not to be a King, as the Iewes
would haue made him: not to call the
righteous, as the phariſeies thought,
but ſinners to repentaunce, as we all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.
For to this purpoſe hath his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
giuen to him his ſeale, he hath ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
him.</p>
            <p>Hereby wee are able to anſwere all
obiections that the deuil &amp; al the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of hell is able to lay againſt vs:
and ſay, if God be on our ſide, who can
be againſt vs: it is chriſt that iuſtifieth,
who ſhall condemne vs. Hee hath the
broad ſeale of his father to this purpoſe,
who can diſanull it? by this ſeale we are
ſealed alſo, as the Apoſtle ſaieth: grieue
not the holy ſpirite of God, by whome
ye are ſealed vnto the day of redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
by outward exerciſes we may doubt
of others:<note place="margin">Ephe. 4.</note> but by this ſeale, the prynte
whereof is in our hearts, we may aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
our ſelues of euerlaſting lyfe.

Caine had a marke to be known:
Eſau being rough, was known from Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob

from the cowardes, who kneeled &amp; lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped:
as Rahab was knowe by binding a
