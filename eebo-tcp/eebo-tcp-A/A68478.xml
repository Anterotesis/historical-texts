            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For they for anger that by theyr owne defaut they haue loſt theyr ꝑte therof / and cannot for prowd hart take theyr faut to them ſelf / fall to blaſphemy as the deuyll doth hym ſelf / and impute theyr ſynne to the faut of goodys grace / and theyr damnacyon to the blame of hys crea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cyo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. So that the prayſe and glory that ys geuen by creatures in hell vnto the lamb for mannys redempcyon / ys onely by the ſowlys in purgatory / that be and ſhalbe partyners of that redempcyon: as the creaturys walkyng vppon yerth ſaylynge in the ſe / that gyue the ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nour to Cryſte for mannys redempcyon / be onely the cryſten people whyche loke and hope to be parteners therof / and not infydels that beleue yt not.

And in thys place yt ys a worlde to ſe the foly of ſome heretykys / what euaſyon they ſeke to voyd from thys place of ſcrypture. They ſey that yt ys no more to be vnderſtanden by ſowlys here in purgatory nor cryſten men lyuyng vppon erth / then by fyſhes in the ſee and the dyuell and damnyd ſoulys in hell: becauſe the text ſayth that euery creature in theſe and in hell ſpake that laud and honour to the lamb. But by this wyſe way myght they preue / that when ye pray for all cryſten ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys /  ye mean to pray for our Ladyes ſouly and for Iudas too: and that our ſauyour when he ſent hys apoſtles and bad them preche his goſpell to euery creature / thay may bere you in hand that he bad the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> preche to oxen and keene and theyre caluys to / becauſe all they be creaturis. But as they were ſente to none other creature / then ſuche as he me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of thoughe he ſpake of all / nor ye meane to pray for no ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lys but ſuch as haue nede and may haue help though ye ſpeke of all: ſo though ſaynt Iha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>n ſpake of euery creature in hell geuyng honour to Cryſte for mannys redempcyon / yet ment he but ſuch as be in the hell in whych they reioyce therin and ſhalbe parteners therof / whych be onely we in purgatorye / and not the dyuels and damnyd ſoulys y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> blaſpheme hym though theyr iuſt poniſhme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te redownd agaynſt theyr wyll to the glory of goddys ryghtuouſnes.</p>
