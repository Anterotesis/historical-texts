            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <head>A letter to a French Gentleman touching the proceedings in England in Ecclesasticall causes translated out of French by T. T.</head>
                     <p>SIr, wheras you desire to be aduertized touching the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings here in Ecclesiasticall causes, because you note in them some inconstancie and variation, as if we enclined sometimes to one side, and sometimes to an other, and as if that clemency and lenity were not vsed of late that was vsed in the beginning, all which you imputed to your owne superficiall vnderstanding of the affaires of this state, hauing notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing hir Maiesties doings in singular reuerence, as the reall pledges which shee hath giuen vnto the world of hir sinceritie in religion, and of hir wisdome in gouernment well meriteth, I am glad of the occasion to imparte the little I knowe in that matter vnto you, both for your owne satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to the end you may make vse therof towards any that shall not be so modestly, nor so reasonably minded, as you are.</p>
                     <p>I finde therfore hir Maiesties proceedings to haue bin grounded vpon two principles. The one: <hi>That consciences are not to be forced, but to be wonne and reduced by the force of Truth with the ayde of time, and the vse of all good meanes of instruction and perswasion:</hi> The other, <hi>That causes of conscience, when they exceede their boundes, and grow to be matter of faction, loose their nature, and that soueraigne Princes ought distinctly to punish the practise in contempt, though coloured with the pretence of conscience and religion.</hi> According to these principles her Maiestie, at her comming to the Crowne vtterly disliking of the tyranny of <hi>Rome,</hi> which had vsed by terrour and rigour to seeke
<pb facs="tcp:11001:6"/>
commaundement of mens faiths and consciences, though as a prince of great wisdome &amp; magnanimitie she suffred but the exercise of one religion, yet hir proceedings towards the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pists</hi> was with great lenitie, expecting the good effects which time might worke in them.</p>
                     <p>And therfore hir Maiestie reuiued not the lawes made in the 28. and 35. of hir fathers raigne, wherby the oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie might haue bin offered at the Kings pleasure to any subiect though hee kept his conscience neuer so modestly to himselfe, &amp; the Refusall to take the same oath without farther circumstances, was made treason: But contrariwise, hir Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie not liking to make windowes into mens harts and secret thoughts, except the aboundance of them did ouerflowe into ouerte and expresse acts or affirmations, tempered hir lawe so as it restraineth only manifest disobedience in impugning and impeaching aduisedly and malitiously hir Maiesties su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preame power and maintaining and extolling a forraigne iurisdiction: And as for the oath, It was altered by hir Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie into a more gratefull forme<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the harshnes of the name, and appellation of <hi>Supreame head</hi> was remoued, &amp; the penalty of the refusall therof turned onely into a disablement to take any promotion, or to exercise any charge; and yet that with li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie of being reuested therin, if any man shall accept thereof during his life.</p>
                     <p>But after, when <hi>Pius Quintus</hi> had excommunicated hir Maiestie, and the Bull of excommunication was published in <hi>London,</hi> wherby hir Maiestie was in sorte proscribed and that theruppon, as vppon a principall motiue or preparatiue fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the rebellion in the North: yet because the ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of the realme were by that rebellion partly purged, and that she feared at that time no forraigne inuasion, and much lesse the attempt of any within the realme not backed by some potent succoure from without, she contented hirselfe to make a lawe against that speciall case of bringing in, or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing of Bulls, or the like instruments: whereunto was added, a prohibition, vppon paine, not of treason, but of an inferior degree of punishment against the bringing in of the <hi>Agnus Dei,</hi> halowed bread, and such other merchandize of <hi>Rome,</hi>

                     <p>But when about the twentieth yeare of hir raigne shee had discouered in the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> an intention to inuade hir do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, and that a principall point of the plotte was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a partie with in the realme that might adhere to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reiner, and that the Seminaries began to blossome and to send forth dayly priests and professed men, who should, by vow taken at shrift, reconcile her subiects from their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, yea and binde many of them to attempt against her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties sacred person, and that by the poyson which they spred, the humors of most <hi>Papists</hi> were altered, and that they were no more <hi>Papists</hi> in conscience and of Softenes, but <hi>Papists</hi> in faction; then were there newe lawes made for the punishment of such as should submitte them selues to such reconcilements or renuntiations of obedience<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And because it was a treason carried in the clowdes and in wonderfull se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecie, and came seldome to light, and that there was no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption thereof so great as the recusancie to come to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine seruice: Because it was sette downe by their decrees.

                     </p>

                     <p>And when not withstanding all this prouision, this poyson was dispersed so secretly, as that there was no meanes to stay it but by restraining the Merchants that brought it in.</p>
                     <p>Then lastly, was there added a Lawe whereby such sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous priests of the new erection were exiled; and those that were at that <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

This hath beene the proceeding, though intermingled, not only with sundrie examples of hir Maiesties grace towards such as in hir wisdome she knewe to be <hi>Papists</hi> in Conscience, and not in Faction and Sigularitie; but also with an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie mitigation towards the offenders in the highest degree conuicted by lawe: If they would but protest<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if in case this realme should be inuaded with a forreine armie by the Popes authoritie, for the Catholique cause, (as they terme it) they would take part with hir Maiestie, and not adhere to hir enemies.</p>

                     <p>A great while when they inueighed against such abuses in the Church, as, <hi>Pluralities, Nonresidence,</hi> &amp; the like; their zeale was not condemned, only their violence was somtimes cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured. When they refused the vse of some ceremonies and rites, as superstitious, they were tollerated with much con<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uence, and gentlenes: Yea, when they called in question the Superioritie of Bishops, and pretended to bring a <hi>Democracie</hi> into the church; Yet, their Propositions were heard, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, and by contrarie writing, debated, and discussed. Yet all this while, it was perceiued that their course was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and very popular: as, because <hi>Papistrie</hi> was odious, therefore it was euer in their mouthes, that they sought to purge the Church from the reliques of <hi>Papistrie,</hi> a thing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to the people, who loue euer to run from one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treame, to an other.</p>
                     <p>Because multitude of Rogues<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Pouertie were an eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soare, and dislike to euerie man, therefore they put it into the peoples head: That, if Discipline were planted, there should be no vagabonds, nor beggers (a thing very plausible.) and in like manner, they promised the people many other impos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible wonders of their Discipline.</p>
                     <p>Besides, they opened the people a way to gouernment by their <hi>Consistorie,</hi> and <hi>Praesbyterie</hi> (a thing though in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce no lesse praeiudiciall to the liberties of priuate men, then

to the soueraignty of Princes, yet in first shew very popular. Neuerthelesse all this (except it were in some few that ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into extreame contempts) was borne, because they preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded but in dutifull maner to make propositions and to leaue it to the prouidence of God, and the authoritie of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate.</p>
                     <p>But now of late yeares, when there issued from them as it were a Colonie of those that affirmed the consent of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate was not to be attended, when vnder pretence of a confession, to auoide slaunders and imputations, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined themselues by classes and subscriptions, when they des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended into that vile &amp; base meanes of defacing the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church by rediculous <hi>Pasqu<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

When they beganne both to vaunt of the strength and number of their partizans, and followers, and to vse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications that their cause would preuaile, though with vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roare and violence. Then it appeared to be no more zeale, no more conscience, but meere faction and diuision: And therefore though the State was compelled to hold somewhat a harder hand to restraine them then before; yet it was with as great moderation as the peace of the Church and State could permitte.</p>
                     <p>And therefore Sir (to conclude) consider vprightly of these matters, and you shall see her Maiestie is no temporizer in religion; she buildes not religion vpon policie, but policie vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on religion; It is not the successe abroade, nor the change of seruants here at home can alter her, onely as the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues alter, so she applieth hir religious wisdome to correspond vnto them, still retaining the two rules before mentioned, in dealing tenderly with consciences, &amp; yet in discouering Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from Conscience, &amp; Softnes from Singularitie.

               <p>What could now obsist (her death being granted) why, betweene it and the Succession proclaymed, Humilitie should not put off his habite of awefulnesse, and like a full eyde faulcon take impatience of handing?

               <p>Because the newes thereof had the same wing with the best expedition of publishing the Succession. Or say, the present ruines of Maiestie, detaining yet the Pieres conscript in the spectacle, had giuen the speaking message of her death the first statte, and preoccupation of eares, yet it being long since registred in the vulgar faith, could not now with all his comment of circumstances take off the foreskinne which had euen ouergrowne the memory of her: for his faith was long since made so yeelding vnto it, that no new force, or concussi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of lowde reporte, but onely lenitiue meanes could giue quickenes to the griefe of it, being so much stupefied &amp; blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with depending, as the sense of his expectation of change with vse, now nothing but euident romage, and the inuersion of the generall methode could be violent in their affections; so much their feare was ouerlaide with delay. For take notice, that this vulgar is not to be preparde to any thing by any, but by Kingly power: It is an extemporall creature, and certaine in nothing but his habite.</p>

               <p>And now as the hand of Discontentment was vp-lifted, when Reuenge lookt big vpon his creditor, and the rich man feared to carry his throate about him.

               <p>In the first place that I may onely differ in mine authoritie from the rest of my countrie men, giue mee leaue to deriue his Maiestie by the history of the Royall house of <hi>England,</hi> written in Italian by <hi>Petruccius Vbaldine Cyttadine</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> for the indifferencie of his Nation, and the reuerence of his testimony, who liued lately among vs, translated by his owne Manuscript, and briefly abridged, as concerning our purpose onely, as followeth. The deuision of the Koyall house of <hi>England</hi> had his originall from the sonnes of <hi>Henry</hi> the third, <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Edmund:</hi> It hath beene supposed by some that <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11001:14"/>
was the elder, and being crooked, <hi>Edward</hi> was preferred the easier before him, which suggestion <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth vsed to colour his vsurpation of the Crowne vpon <hi>Richard</hi> the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond.</p>
               <p>This faction after it burst out, caused bloody warres in <hi>England,</hi> either house prosecuting the other to the destruction of them both; the possession of the Crowne remaining to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther according to their force, the fortune and fauor of the time.</p>
               <p>This controuersie after God had made vse therein to mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest his iust punishment of <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth in his children, for his cruelty towards <hi>Henry</hi> the sixt, and <hi>Edward</hi> his sonne, together with some periuries that the histories impose vpon him and his vnnaturall dealing towards his brother <hi>Clarence,</hi> was by the plotte of <hi>Morton</hi> Bishop of <hi>Elie</hi> taken away in the performance of that oath which he tooke of <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Richmond</hi> of the house of <hi>Lancaster,</hi> to marry with <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the sole heire of the contrary house, after the tyrant <hi>Richard</hi> slaine in battaile.</p>
               <p>Of this <hi>Henry</hi> the seauenth came <hi>Henry</hi> the eight with his sisters, the eldest of which being named <hi>Margaret,</hi> King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the seauenth in his spirit of prophecie, wherein he had a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar potencie (as the history of his dying makes mention) and in his prouidence of reducing the two Kingdomes of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> into one entire Monarchie, as his owne hand wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting left behinde him can sufficiently testifie, did match with the Scepter of <hi>Scotland,</hi> from whence both by father and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther after the issue of <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, now extinct is deriued King <hi>Iames</hi> of both Kingdomes the immediate successor: who for the constancie of his fauours, his inappetence of new pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, and his care of husbanding the meanes of all his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions for their owne good and preseruation, is liuely modeled by his grandfather <hi>Henry</hi> the seauenth, whose example <hi>Vbaldine</hi> commendeth to his successours for the best forme of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string the Commonwealth abroad, and the houshold at home: In his dayes the Nobilitie wonted not to procure accesse through inferiour aduocation, nor the <hi>Fabij</hi> to haue their cause solicited by <hi>Vinius</hi> bondman, or <hi>Nimphidius</hi> verlottes, the Commons were yet inuited to contributions, but came freely, nor the Exchequer was euer better stored with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

               <p>Now you haue sufficiently implide in the title his prerogatiue of vniting these two Kingdomes, warranted and instanced both out of holy writ, and traditionall reporte of Scepters long since translated with their whole tribes and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, I desire you to come to the question of their aptnesse thereunto in the second place?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Answ.</speaker>
               <p>To prooue an Aptnesse in the Scot to incorporate with the English, let me tell you what kinde of Aptnesse is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in this place. For Aptnesse of agreeing is either in <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> or <hi>Beautie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And because there is a generall Aptnesse, or an Aptnesse in Substance, euen in the Scithian to incorporate with any the most ciuill nation, that is, hauing in his reasonable soule matter malleable therunto, without farther immoration vpon it, I lay the present proofe in Aptnesse of the Beautie of their <hi>Maners, Lawes,</hi> and <hi>Language.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of which the Beautie is to be tried and examined by these his two Trialls, <hi>Delight</hi> and <hi>Similitude.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That his maners haue complacence &amp; similitude of Beauty with ours of the English in religious maners it appeares. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only conformable with the English. Both which the other world remooued aparte makes seeme one Cittie vpon a hill.</p>
               <p>In conuersation he delights vs the more by how much the liuelier he onely expresseth our endeuors, and our principles whereby there is discerned a mutuall Aptnesse, and inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in both, owing our duties to the same Scepter to become one entire, and vndistinct Monarchie.</p>
               <p>Of Lawes, (Law ye fir) <hi>Iustine</hi> sayes there is no difference so long as they agree in the fundamentall parts, being executed <hi>Per eos Legis peritos qui sunt honesti, studiosi iustitia, non anari, &amp;c.</hi> It is some thing in latine, which I can not translate into English I assure you sir.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:11001:15"/>
Of Language because the difference is but this, that the English is like a Denshire carsie after fulling set out with all the arte of draperie to giue it grace and glosse. And the Scottish vnstarcht with inkehorne, stage suiting conscisenesse It can not choose but delight the English Orator for firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and soliditie, hauing much cleanenesse and puritie in the written letter, The Poet for descant vppon the first eliments of his naturall phrasing; and both for very Aptnes and consimilitie of sentence.</p>
               <p>Now for the preseruing of this vnion the secondarie meanes which occurre are either, <hi>Free meanes,</hi> or <hi>Obligatory and lesse free.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The free meanes are these, <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Confidence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First by <hi>Election</hi> we shine in humanitie to select his strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse into fellowship of exercising and businessing: wherein; by desiring him well we shall duly erogate the like from him.</p>
               <p>The next is to be confident in onr election when wee excercise or businesse with him, in freenesse of spirite apertly; not curiously with obseruing into him: wherby we shall chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to discouer in his generous expansure (I speak of their gentry chiefly) much cause of delight in our choice, by the plentifull accommodation of his parts in conuerse.</p>
               <p>I call these Free meanes because they proceed only of libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall education &amp; nobilitie in nature, which are by these two signes to be distinguished from such soules as are conditions, slaues.</p>
               <p>The Obligatorie or lesser liberall meanes, next vnder the Lawes, are in <hi>Conditions of Commercement, Seales of marriage,</hi> and <hi>Bonds of duty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>First, in Commercement, when our thrift is implied and promised to ourbusinesse with him (as no dubt but it carrieth such profite with it as shall vphold the benefite of either in all and like contentment.</p>
               <p>Secondly in Marriage, which being now sealed betwixt the sons and daughters, of either is obligatory in nature after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>summation, and before in Couenant for the most part. If o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, it is a free meanes: Howsoeuer, it makes no lesse alike the liberties and reputations of either than Election and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence

               <p>Wherefore I commend it to both hauing such pregnant aptnes vpon their complexions and in then dispositions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto for the best meanes of incorporating and preseruing this vnion euerlastingly.</p>
               <p>Lastly, in Duty, and to this we are whipt &amp; led by the Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mall motion of like for like, in Liberties in Reputations, and in Benefite: where there is no difference (if so please his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie) of Franchisement; none of Heraldry, nor yet of Marte; both being within the same Ocean both one Monarchie, and one Citty vpon a hill, without confusion of Manners, Lawes or Language.</p>
