            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>Preface.</head>
            <p>AS General Abridgements of the Statutes of this Realm have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been and will alwayes continue to be of great uſe; ſo now ſince they are become ſo voluminous, there ſeems to be a like uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, if not a neceſſity, of particular A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgements to direct thoſe whoſe Study and Employment is more eſpecially converſant in ſome peculiar practice of the Law.</p>
            <p>Some Collections of this Nature are already publiſhed: One concerning the Office of a Iuſtice of Peace, under the Title of <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuta Pacis,</hi> which comprehends a great part of the Crown Law. Others relating to the Kings Revenue, as that of the <hi>Cuſtomes,</hi> of the Exciſe, another of the <hi>Hearth</hi> money, all of great benefit in their ſeveral kinds.</p>
            <p>But thoſe ſtatutes that immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to the General Practice of the Common Law and the Courts wherein the ſame is uſed, have not hitherto been collected apart, and are in a manner left, as the choice fruit upon the upper Branches not to be ſeen for the Cluſters that hang below.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:93994:3"/>
This Book therefore is deſigned for thoſe Statutes, wherein as there is no repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of what hath been in any former parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Abridgements: ſo neither is there any notice taken of the Multitude of thoſe other Statutes, ſome whereof refer to a part of the Realm only, as thoſe of older time w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> concern the uniting of <hi>Wales,</hi> and fixing juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons there, and the like; in <hi>Counties Palatine,</hi> and of later, for the drayning of the <hi>Fenns</hi> which extend but to ſome Countryes; others are reſtrayned to peculiar Juriſdictions as thoſe of the <hi>Sewers,</hi> of <hi>Charitable uſes, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation of Corporations, &amp;c.</hi> others which (though more general) reſpect only the <hi>Policy</hi> of the Realm in preſerving its <hi>Religion, Strength, Trade, Riches,</hi> and <hi>Beauty,</hi> ſuch are the ſtatutes that concern the <hi>Divine Service</hi> and <hi>Sacraments Anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary Feaſts</hi> and <hi>Faſts</hi> upon ſpecial Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the <hi>Militia Revenue, Navigation, Fiſhing Tymber, Drapery,</hi> and ſeveral other <hi>Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures,</hi> rebuilding of <hi>London,</hi> and many more of that kind.</p>
            <p>All which though of Publique Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, yet not having a direct Aſpect upon private <hi>rights</hi> and <hi>poſſeſſions,</hi> are forreign to the preſent deſign, and moſt proper for gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Abridgments, in which they are to be had:
<pb facs="tcp:93994:3"/>
This being intended chiefly for the benefit of practiſers and ſtudents of the <hi>Common Law,</hi> that in their practice and reading they might have a ready recourſe to thoſe ſtatutes which particularly relate thereunto.</p>
            <p>It was not thought convenient to go beyond the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>3.</hi> ſince when the practice of the Law has been moſt uniforme; becauſe moſt of the Old ſtatutes, as <hi>Magna Charta, Merton, Marlebridge, Weſt. 1. 2. 3.</hi> and the reſt till this time are generally but declaratory and affirmative of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon law</hi> (as my Lord <hi>Cook</hi> has obſerved) and may now by their Antiquity and uninterrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted uſage be ſaid to be incorporated into the body of the Common Law, with which this treatiſe medleth not: The other parts of thoſe <hi>Antient Statutes</hi> referring generally to ſuch proceedings as now are wholly out of uſe, and therefore not proper to be inſerted: ſuch are thoſe many Chapters that concern pleadings and other proceedings in <hi>real Actions</hi> now out of uſe, and are already in print by the name of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> and other antient Statutes in a little volume by themſelves.</p>
            <p>Here therefore ſuch only are culled out as referr to the <hi>Law</hi> as 'tis now uſed and practiſed, wherein ſuch Care has been taken that nothing Material is omitted: ſo that
<pb facs="tcp:93994:4"/>
though it le not directly but Collaterally within the deſign of this Treatiſe, they are here mentioned, as the ſtatute of <hi>Hue</hi> and <hi>Crye,</hi> becauſe many Actions are brought thereupon, and thoſe of <hi>Bankrupts</hi> being of general and dayly uſe &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But ſuch ſtatutes as have abrogated or reſcinded what formerly hath been in uſe by the diſſolution of <hi>Courts,</hi> alteration of <hi>te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nures,</hi> Abridgment of <hi>Michaelmas Term,</hi> and the like, are here omitted.</p>
            <p>It were to be wiſhed that the ſtatutes as they are here ſet down in Order of time in the firſt Table, were printed at large in a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume together by themſelves, becauſe of that general Objection to Abridgments, that they are not of unqueſtionable Authority; and it would be of further benefit to ſtudents if en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terleaved, becauſe many of the Caſes and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports that are Extant are aptly referrable thereunto, which if collected with Diligence and Iudgment would be an Excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the ſame.</p>
            <p>However theſe Tables and Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are of extraordinary uſe: for as the firſt Table ſhews what <hi>Statutes</hi> were made in every particular Kings Raign, ſo the other furniſheth you with the common and known heads and Titles of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>on Law</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="tcp:93994:4"/>
every ſtatute referreth: where at one view you may ſee what ſeveral ſtatutes in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Kings Reigns have been made concerning ſuch a Branch, head or Title of the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law,</hi> ſuch as is uſed by Practiſers and Students in their Common Place Books.</p>
            <p>And ſince there is a great diverſity in the Methodiſing of thoſe heads, as that of <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herbert, Brook, Raſtal, Aſh,</hi> and of late one more accurate by Serjeant <hi>Roles;</hi> The Reader may be pleaſed to take notice, that what he finds here, is digeſted (as nearly as could be) according to the laſt.</p>
