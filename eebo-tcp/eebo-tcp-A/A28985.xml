         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>Advertiſement</hi> of the Publiſher to the READER.</head>
            <p>THE Deſign of the following Papers the Author's own Preface will acquaint thee with. And though, as thou wilt there ſee, his Expectation of Aſſiſtance (in a Work too great for one ſingle Man's <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ndertaking) from others fail'd him; yet I doubt not but his own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Collections would have made this Treatiſe much larger before it had been publiſhed, had his Health allowed him Opportunity: But that permitting him not ſo much as to review theſe Papers, or range them into that order, which would be moſt advantageous, thou art not to wonder, if thou findeſt ſome Defects, ſome Diſlocations, and other Faults in this Publication, which the Author's last Hand would have prevented. The Negligence of Tranſcribers has let ſlip the Characters of Relators, and Names and Places of Author's from whom ſeveral of the Particulars in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Papers were taken: Nor could it be hoped that the Authors own Memory (were he in a State of Health fit to be troubled with it) ſhould after ſo long a time as this Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection has been making, and in that Variety of Men and Books he has had to do with, be able to retrieve them. But this will be no great Loſs to the learned World, which is ſufficiently acquainted with his great Cantion, and will make no Difficulty confidently to rely upon his unaffected Candor and Sincerity. I know not how much ſome other Parts of his noble, and always buſy Deſigns for the Advancement of Knowledg, and the Benefit of Mankind, may ſuffer by that
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:100378:3"/>
Tenderneſs of his Conſtitution, which the Importunity of his Friends can hardly prevail upon him to withdraw from Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Cares. But this he has ordered ſo, that imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as it is, one cannot call it deficient; ſince the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being here laid, and the Draught made, every one may, if he pleaſe, add towards the compleating of the building, I will not ſay with Materials equal to what his Sagacity and Laboratory uſed to afford: For we must not expect to find in every Age a Man able and ready to lay out ſo much Coſt, Pains and Skill, frankly, for the Improvement of Natural Philoſophy, and the Information of the World, as he has done. The Scheme of Titles under which theſe Materials for a Hiſtory of the <hi>Air</hi> are ranged, is ſomewhat different from that printed by him ſeveral Years ſince, and diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted amongst his Friends. But this is without any Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the main Deſign, ſince whatſoever any one hath col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected under thoſe Heads, will be eaſily reducible to theſe, which in a more natural Order are more comprehenſive. In that firſt Draught he followed my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Advice, not to be over-curious or nice in making the firſt Set of Heads, but to take them as they occur. But now that thus much comes to be publiſhed, which perhaps may ſerve to ſome Men as a common Place for the Hiſtory of the Air, the Titles have been a little more increaſed or methodized, to which any one may add as he finds Occaſion: Only in theſe the Reader is deſired to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">I. That under the Title of <hi>Mineral Subſtances,</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended Earth, and all other Foſſiles to avoid multiplying of Articles.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That when any mixed Body is ranked under <hi>Animal, Vegetable,</hi> or <hi>Mineral Subſtances,</hi> it is put under that of the three which either it partakes moſt of, or to which moſt is owing in the preſent Experiment, or which in its own Nature it moſt reſembles.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:100378:3"/>
III. That it is not by an Over-ſight that <hi>Lightning</hi> is put under two different Titles; for in one it is conſidered only in reference to the Sight; in the other it is conſidered as the Product of ſulphureous or inflamable Effluviums taking fire, with the ſtrange Effects it produces; which may be an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of puting the ſame thing with different Views, under different Heads.</p>
            <p>What is aboveſaid was written whilſt the Author was li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, to which it is neceſſary now to add, That the Titles, as here printed, and the Orders of the Papers, as now ranged under them, were ſhewn to the Author, and approved by him as fitter for the General Hiſtory of the <hi>Air,</hi> than thoſe he had formerly printed. So that, Reader, thou hast theſe Papers as they were prepared and ordered to be publiſhed in his Life-time; and they had then gone to the Preſs to be printed, just as thou now receiveſt them, had not the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſher the laſt Winter been haſtily called out of Town.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE continual <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> of the Air is ſo abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to our <hi>Life;</hi> the good or bad <hi>Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of it is ſo important to our <hi>Health;</hi> and the ſcarce evitable <hi>Preſence</hi> and powerful <hi>Preſſure</hi> of it, has ſo great an Intereſt in many of the <hi>Phaenomena</hi> we meet with here below, and even in divers where its Agency is not ſuſpected; that among mere <hi>Bodies</hi> there are perhaps few Subjects that more deſerve our Curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whether as we are Animals, or as we are Natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts. Upon which Account I can ſcarce think that any thing that conduces to the fuller Knowledg of a Body ſo diffuſed, ſo neceſſary, and ſo powerful, is fit to be <hi>deſpiſed,</hi> or is unworthy to be <hi>preſerved</hi> in Writing.</p>
            <p>And therefore, though I have formerly had occaſion to treat, in diſtinct Tracts, of ſome of the <hi>Qualities</hi> or <hi>Affections</hi> of the <hi>Air,</hi> as its <hi>Gravity, Springineſs,</hi> &amp;c. yet I found my ſelf inclined to contribute further to the Knowledg of that vaſt and uſeful Subject, by ſetting down ſome <hi>Memorials,</hi> partly out of my own Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Trials, and partly out of thoſe I had from Perſons of good Credit, concerning ſome Cauſes and Effects of the Changes of the Air, and conſequently concerning ſeveral of its Qualities that were requiſite to be taken into Conſideration in a work of that Nature. And not content with this, though my own Studies
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:100378:6"/>
and Affairs would not permit me to proſecute my ſelf the Deſign I am going to mention, yet thinking it might be a very uſeful thing, in reference both to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy and Phyſick, that a Natural Hiſtory of the Air (though at firſt it ſhould prove but a very imperfect one) were faithfully compiled, I propounded the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to ſome <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> that ſeem'd to reliſh it, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to be Aſſiſtant in it.</p>
            <p>And to facilitate their Work, I drew up a Set of Heads and Inquiries of that ſort, which in another Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per I call <hi>Titles of the firſt Claſſis or Order;</hi> which, tho purpoſely ſet down without any anxious Method, were comprehenſive enough to have a good Number and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Particulars conveniently referr'd to them. But afterwards finding the Perſons to whom I had commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted theſe Schemes, to have been for many Years very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of their Promiſes; I did on this Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lay aſide, not only the Hopes of a <hi>General Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Air,</hi> but what I had already written about the Changes of that Body.</p>
            <p>And upon the ſame Accounts, thoſe ſcattered Notes lay many Years in looſe neglected Papers, till at length the Curioſity and Deſires of ſome <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> that knew I had gathered ſome Remarks, though few and incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, touching ſome Qualities of the Air, obliged me to draw together thoſe that without a troubleſome Search I could retrieve, offering themſelves to promote the Deſign that others had abandon'd. The Deſire to gratify theſe Inquiſitive Men, and the Conviction I am brought under, by ſuch Reaſons as are mentioned at the Beginning of this Paper, that ſcarce any Truth, whether Hiſtorical or Doctrinal, that relates to ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant a Subject as the <hi>Air,</hi> is unfit to be preſerv'd, prevail'd with me, rather to chuſe a very diſadvantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:100378:6"/>
way of ſetting down what I have to deliver about it, than ſuffer the looſe Obſervations I had occaſion to make about ſome <hi>Phanomena</hi> and <hi>Qualities,</hi> and eſpecially the <hi>Changes</hi> of the Air, to be loſt. And therefore, though I have not the leiſure to methodize my incoherent Notes, and much leſs to weave them into continued Diſcourſes; yet rather than let them periſh, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appoint thoſe that will have them ſuch as they are, I am content to refer to ſome of the Titles prefixed to this Treatiſe, as to a kind of Common Places, what my Memory, or ſome old Notes about divers things re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Air, and eſpecially to the <hi>Cauſes and Effects of its Changes,</hi> ſupply me with in reference to that Body.</p>
            <p>And upon the like Account, I have not ſtrictly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined my ſelf to the mention of my looſe Obſervations, and thoſe that I have been furniſhed with by Anſwers to the Queſtions I put to divers Travellers and Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: but I have alſo caſt in ſeveral pertinent Paſſages that chanced to occur to me in the reading of ſome Voyages, and other Books, eſpecially ſuch as either are <hi>out of Print,</hi> or are but <hi>in few Hands,</hi> or elſe are not extant in thoſe that are called the <hi>Learned Languages.</hi> And that thoſe <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> that are willing to contribute their Induſtry to carry on the Deſign that was at firſt propoſed, might have ſome Heads whereunto to refer what ſhall occur to them; I thought fit to premiſe to my Papers the above-mentioned Scheme, or rough Draught, of the <hi>General Hiſtory</hi> (which after many Years I chanced to recover.) I have alſo thought fit, that under three or four Titles, my Collections of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars ſhould be ſomewhat large and Methodical, to afford the ſame Perſons ſome <hi>Specimens</hi> of what I ſhould have thought requiſite to do upon particular Subjects, if
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:100378:7"/>
I would have ventur'd upon ſuch a Task, as to write a <hi>Natural Hiſtory of the Air.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that I expoſe my ſelf to Cenſure, for ſuffering to paſs out of my Hands, Memoirs ſo maimed and imperfect, that ſeveral of the Subjects mentioned in the Scheme of Titles are left altogether untouch'd; and thoſe that are particularly mentioned, are for the moſt part touch'd upon but lightly. But the chief, though not perhaps the only Reaſons that kept me from being ſilenc'd by theſe Conſiderations, though I confeſs them to be weighty, were theſe. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That not pretending to write the <hi>Hiſtory of the Air,</hi> but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſome Memoirs for it; I might without Incongruity or Indecency contribute what had occurr'd to me in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſome of the Titles, though I left the others to thoſe that had made Experiments or Obſervations about them. <hi>Next,</hi> That having through the Fraud or Negligence of ſome Perſons, loſt ſundry looſe Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers that I had provided for the <hi>Hiſtory of the Air,</hi> my Unwillingneſs that the reſt ſhould undergo the ſame Fate, invited me to impart them to many, as the beſt Expedient to ſecure them. To which I, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> add an Inducement, which though laſt named, was the firſt in Efficacy, as that which made the other two ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant; namely, that I had more than once obſerved, that when a Work of this Nature has been once begun and taken notice of, in ſuch an inquiſitive and active Age as this of ours, it ſeldom fails to excite the Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and Induſtry of others, whom, if the Deſign be any thing well laid, the Utility that it promiſes will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite to carry it on.</p>

               <p>Of the conſtant and permanent <hi>Ingredients</hi> of the Air.</p>
            </argument>
            <head type="sub">A ſhort Anſwer to a Queſtion about the Nature of the Air, given by Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> to Mr. <hi>H. Oldenburg.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AS to your Queſtion, <hi>What I think the Air to be?</hi> I ſhall in the firſt place take it for granted, that by the Air you mean not, either the pure Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Air, which <hi>ſome,</hi> nor that Etherial or Celeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Subſtance, that <hi>others</hi> (upon what Grounds I muſt not here examine) aſſert; but that, which I am wont to call the <hi>Atmoſpherical</hi> Air, which is that common Air we breath and move in.</p>
            <p>But though I know you too well, to ſuſpect that you deſign any Ambiguity in your Queſtion; yet I ſhall not adventure to anſwer it, till I have premiſed a Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that is not uſual: For, according to my Thoughts, the Air may be taken <hi>either</hi> for that which is <hi>Temporary,</hi> (if I may ſo call it;) <hi>or</hi> in a <hi>Tranſient</hi> State; <hi>or</hi> that which is <hi>Laſting,</hi> and in a <hi>Permanent</hi> State. This Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction, which perhaps you look'd not for, I ſhall il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate by this Example; That if you ſufficiently heat an Eolipile furniſhed with Water, and ſtay a pretty while to afford time for the expulſion of the <hi>Aerial</hi> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles by the <hi>Aqueous</hi> Vapours, you may afterwards ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100378:8"/>
that theſe laſt named will be driven out in multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes, and with a noiſe, and will emulate a Wind or Stream of Air, by blowing Coals, held at a convenient diſtance, like a pair of Bellows, and by producing a ſharp and whiſtling Sound againſt the edg of a Knife, held in a convenient Poſture almoſt upon the Orifice of the Pipe, whence they iſſue out. But this vapid Stream, though in theſe, and ſome other things it imitates true Air, whilſt the vehement Agitation laſts, which the Vapours it conſiſts of, received from the Fire; yet in a very ſhort time, eſpecially if the Weather, or the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels it enters into, be cold, loſes the <hi>temporary</hi> Form it ſeemed to have of Air, and returns to Water, as it was at firſt.</p>
            <p>This premiſed, I come to ſpeak <hi>directly,</hi> but dare not do it <hi>confidently,</hi> to your Queſtion: For though poſſibly I may have made as many Trials as another about the Nature of the Air; yet I freely confeſs to you, that I much ſuſpect there lies yet ſomething concealed in it, that needs a further Diſcovery, which may perhaps be made by further Trials. But in the mean time, (not wholly to baffle your Curioſity, ſince 'tis ſo modeſt, as to deſire to know of me, not what the true Nature of the Air is, but what I gueſs concerning its chiefeſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty or Attribute) I will acquaint you with ſome of the Thoughts I long ago had, and which I yet took upon my ſelf, and deſire to have them look'd upon by you but as Conjectures, entertain'd only till farther Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries confirm them, or ſuggeſt better in their room.</p>
            <p>It ſeems then not improbable to me, that our <hi>Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpherical</hi> Air may conſiſt of <hi>three</hi> differing Kinds of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles. The <hi>firſt</hi> is made of that numberleſs Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and great Variety of Particles, which, under the form of Vapours or dry Exhalations, aſcend from the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100378:9"/>
Earth, Water, Minerals, Vegetables and Animals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and in a word, of whatever Subſtances are elevated by the Celeſtial or Subterraneal Heats, and made to diffuſe themſelves into the Atmoſphere. The <hi>ſecond</hi> ſort of Particles that make the Air, may be yet more ſubtile than the former, and conſiſt of ſuch exceeding minute Parts, as make up the <hi>Magnetical</hi> Steams of our Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial Globe, and the innumerable Particles, that the Sun and other Stars, that ſeem to ſhine of themſelves, do either emit out of their own Bodies, or by their Preſſure thruſt againſt our Eyes, and thereby produce what we call <hi>Light;</hi> which, whether we explicate it by the <hi>Epicurean</hi> or <hi>Carteſian</hi> Hypotheſis, argues a great Plenty of a Celeſtial, or ſome other very ſubtile Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to be diſperſed through, or harboured in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals of the ſtabler or groſſer Corpuſcles of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere.</p>
            <p>But becauſe you expect from me a diſtinguiſhing, and as it were, <hi>Characteriſtick</hi> Quality, which may put a difference between the Parts already named of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, and thoſe to which moſt of the <hi>Phenomena</hi> of our Engine, and many other Pneumatical Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſeem to be due; I ſhall add a <hi>third</hi> ſort of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſpherical Particles, compared with which, I have not yet found any, whereto the Name of Air does ſo deſervedly belong. And this ſort of Particles are thoſe, which are not only for a while, by manifeſt outward Agents, made Elaſtical, but are <hi>permanently</hi> ſo, and on that account may be ſtil'd <hi>Perennial</hi> Air.</p>
            <p>Of the Structure of the Elaſtical Particles of the Air, divers Conceptions may be framed, according to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Contrivances Men may deviſe to anſwer the <hi>Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena:</hi> For one may think them to be like the <hi>Springs</hi> of <hi>Watches,</hi> coil'd up, and ſtill endeavouring to fly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100378:9"/>
One may alſo fancy a Portion of Air to be like a Lock or Parcel of curled <hi>Hairs</hi> of <hi>Wooll;</hi> which being compreſſed by an external Force, or their own Weight, may have a continual endeavour to ſtretch themſelves out, and thruſt away the neighbouring Particles, and whatever other Bodies would hinder them to recover their former State, or attain their full Liberty. One may alſo fancy them like extreamly <hi>ſlender Wires,</hi> ſuch as thoſe of Gold and Silver, that Tradeſmen unwind from ſome Cylindrical Bodies of differing Sizes, on which they were rolled; which Pieces of Spiral or cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Wire may be, <hi>as</hi> of differing Subſtances and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtences, <hi>ſo</hi> of very differing Lengths and Thickneſſes, and have their Curls greater or leſſer, nearer each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or more diſtant, and be otherwiſe diverſified; and yet all have Springineſs in them, and (notwithſtanding) be, by reaſon of their Shape, readily expanſible on the ſcore of their native Structure, as alſo by Heat, Girati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and other Motions; and compreſſible by an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Force into a very little room. I remember too, that I have among other Compariſons of this kind, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the ſpringy Particles of the Air, like the very <hi>thin Shavings of Wood,</hi> (that Carpenters and Joiners are wont to take off with their Plainers;) for, beſides that theſe may be made of differing Woods, as Oak, Aſh, Firr, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and thereby be diverſified as to their Subſtance, they are uſually of very various Breadths, and Lengths, and Thickneſſes. And perhaps you may the rather prefer this Compariſon, becauſe it may ſeem ſomewhat to illuſtrate the <hi>Production</hi> of the ſpringy Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of the Air: for to make theſe Shavings, there is no Art nor curious Inſtruments required; and their Curls are no ways uniform, but many ways differing, and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingly caſual; and, which is chiefly conſiderable, theſe
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:100378:10"/>
Shavings are producible out of Bodies, that did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, nor were ſuſpected to be Elaſtical in their Bulk, as Beams and Blocks; almoſt any of which may afford ſpringy Shavings, barely by having ſome of its Parts ſo taken off, as to be thin and flexible enough, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modiouſly ſhap'd: Which may perhaps illuſtrate what I tried, that divers ſolid, and even mineral Bodies, not ſuſpected of Elaſticity, being put into corroſive Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruums, devoid of that Quality, there will, upon the convenient Comminution of Parts, inſuing the Action and Re-action, that paſſes between them in the Diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, reſult or emerge a pretty Quantity of permanent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Elaſtical Fire. But poſſibly you will think that theſe are but extravagant Conjectures; and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adding any thing in favour of them, I ſhall proceed, and willingly grant, that one may fancy ſeveral other Shapes (and perhaps fitter than theſe we have mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned) for theſe ſpringy Corpuſcles; about whoſe Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture I ſhall not now particularly diſcourſe, becauſe of the variety of probable Conjectures that, I think, may be propoſed concerning it. Only I ſhall here intimate, that though the Elaſtical Air ſeem to continue ſuch, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon the ſcore of its Structure, than any external Agitation; yet Heat, that is a kind of Motion, may make the agitated Particles ſtrive to recede further and further from the Centers of their Motions, and to beat off thoſe, that would hinder the freedom of their Gyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſo very much add to the endeavour of ſuch Air to expand it ſelf. And I will allow you to ſuſpect, that there may be ſometimes mingled with the Particles that are ſpringy, upon the newly mentioned Account, ſome others, that owe their Elaſticity, not ſo much to their Structure, as their Motion, which, variouſly bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhing them and whirling them about, may make them
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100378:10"/>
beat off the neighbouring Particles, and thereby pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote an expanſive Endeavour in the Air, whereof they are Parts. And though ſome of theſe may, in very cold Climates and Seaſons, prove to be of thoſe, which I not long ſince referr'd to <hi>temporary</hi> Air; yet others of them may be ſo minute and agile, and ſo advantageouſly ſhap'd, that at leaſt in our Climate, the Air will ſcarce be ſo cold, but that the Cauſes, which entertain the Agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, and keep it fluid, may alſo give a competent Motion to Particles ſo well diſpoſed to be kept in it.</p>
            <p>And now, Sir, 'twill be time to indeavour to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to ſome Particulars, that may countenance the Conjectures I have hitherto been propoſing.</p>
            <p>Having not now the leiſure to proſecute this Diſcourſe uninterruptedly, till it be compleatly finiſh'd, I thought it not unfit, not only to ſet down, in this Paper, ſome of thoſe occurring Thoughts and Obſervations of my own, upon this Subject, that were the likelieſt, unleſs this way preſerved, to vaniſh out of my Memory, and which may ſerve to recal divers others into it; but alſo to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex ſome Paſſages referable to the ſame Purpoſes, bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed from ſuch Books, as probably I may not have at hand, when I ſhall reſume this Treatiſe. Theſe two ſorts of Paſſages make up the following Notes, and are therefore to be look'd upon but as materially here laid together to be preſerved, not ſo much for themſelves (though ſome of them perhaps deſerve not to periſh) as in Order to the finiſhing of the deſign'd Structure. And though, for that Reaſon, they may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten appear very confuſedly placed, yet they may ſeem more incoherent than they are, there being certain Tranſitions, and other things, by which ſome of them may be ſo connected, as to be fit to make diſcourſive Parts and Paragraphs of the Treatiſe they belong to;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100378:11"/>
upon which Account 'tis that they are put at divers Diſtances one from another, that if hereafter I have leiſure, there may be room for the Tranſitions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by which they are deſigned to be connected into cohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Diſcourſes.</p>

               <p>THAT the Air has a great Intereſt in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of many Phenomena of Nature, either not formerly known, or not formerly aſcribed unto it, as the chief Agent, if as any at all, has been, I ſuppoſe ſufficiently manifeſted by our own Experiments, as well as by thoſe publiſhed by abler Writers.</p>
               <p>That alſo the Air is neceſſary not only to the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being, but to the verry Being and Motions of the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of Animals, will be eaſily deduc'd from thoſe Trials whereby we have made it appear, that Animals whoſe Blood is hot, may be killed in our Engine by the withdrawing of the Air in about one Minute of an Hour, and that even thoſe minute Creatures, whoſe Blood or Analogous Juice is cold, will for the moſt part, without excepting Cheeſe-Mites themſelves, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently loſe all their viſible Motions, upon the Receſs of the Air, may appear from our Experiments about Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration.</p>
               <p>Wherefore the Air, being a Body ſo important in our Speculations of Nature, and ſo neceſſary to the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:100378:16"/>
Continuance of our Lives, I could not but think it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that we ſhould ſolicitouſly inquire, whether it may or may not be produc'd by Art; for if it can be ſo by any, not very uneaſily practicable ways, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery may not only help us to explicate ſome difficult Phenomena of Nature, but may afford us, among ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Uſes, that of enabling us to ſupply divers, if not alſo ſubmarine Navigators with freſh Air produced under Water, and thereby lengthen their ſtaying in Places, where the Continuance of it may be of great Uſe both ſpeculative and practical.</p>
               <p>Upon theſe and the like Motives, I reſolv'd, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Difficulties I foreſaw my Curioſity would meet with in ſo new an Attempt, to try what I could do. But before I relate the Succeſs of this Attempt, I muſt premiſe a couple of neceſſary Advertiſements.</p>
               <p>And firſt, when I here ſpeak of Production of Air, I deſire to be underſtood in a familiar Senſe, meaning by that Expreſſion the obtaining a ſenſible Quantity of Air, from Bodies wherein it did not appear before they were handled after our way, that ſo much Air, if any at all, was pre-exiſtent. This I ſay, becauſe I would not in this Place needleſly ingage in the Controverſy about the Ingenerability (as they ſpeak) or the mutual Tranſmutation of the Bodies that are called Elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for though I am not ſure, but that ſome of our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments may argue a new and real Production of Air, or a Generation of it in the ſtricter Senſe, yet I ſhall now imploy the words Generation and Production, in the large and popular Acception, and would ſignify by them, as I lately intimated, the obtaining of a ſenſible Quantity of Aerial Subſtances from Bodies, that did not appear to have it, whether this obtain'd Subſtance were due to an Extrication and Union of Aerial Particles la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:100378:16"/>
in the Pores of the Bodies that afforded it, or to a real Production or Generation of Air, no where exiſtent antecedently to our Experiments. And this is the firſt of my two Advertiſements.</p>
               <p>The ſecond is this, That among the Difficulties, I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw, in making Experiments ſuited to my Deſign, I look'd upon it as one of the greateſt, though the leaſt obvious, that to ſatisfy ſuch a Diſpoſition as mine, that is naturally prone enough to queſtion things, it would be requiſite for me to conſider, and, if I could, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine by appropriated Trials, whether the fluid Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances my Experiments might afford me, deſerv'd the Name of Air or not. Wherefore I ſaw my ſelf oblig'd to increaſe my Task, and ſo direct my Inquiries, that in the firſt Place they may afford me ſenſible Portions of ſuch a Subſtance, as in a popular Senſe may be ſtiled Air, whether theſe obtain'd Subſtances ought to be look'd upon as true Air or no. So that my intended Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition would naturally conſiſt of two Parts, whereof the former was to contain the ways of producing, that which ſeems Air; and the other to propound thoſe of examining, how far the produc'd Subſtance is indow'd with the Qualities, that are judg'd to belong to Air as ſuch.</p>
               <p>But in regard that I thought it moſt convenient ſo to contrive my Experiments, as to make ſuch of them as I could to ſerve me, both to produce Air, and to examine it, I ſhall be more than once obliged to mingle the two Parts of my Diſquiſition, and reſerve for the latter of them, only thoſe few Trials, that concern purely the Examen of the produced Air.</p>
               <p>And upon this Score it will be ſeaſonable to take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice in this Place, that foraſmuch as there are divers Qualities aſcribed to Air, which to me ſeem but acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:100378:17"/>
and not univerſally to belong to Air as ſuch, I have not obſerved any one Attribute that I think to be ſo much the Property of Air, and ſo fit to diſtinguiſh its true Particles from aqueous Vapours, earthy Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of other Bodies, as a durable Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity or Springineſs. And therefore I ſhall henceforth imploy that, as the chief Criterion, whereby to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute a Portion of Matter Aerial, and diſcriminate it from other flying and fluid Subſtances, and conſequently to allow or deny it the Title of Air.</p>
               <p>Now among the ſeveral Ways I thought of, whereby to produce Air, thoſe I judg'd fitteſt to put in practice were theſe. 1. By Fermentation. 2. By Corroſions and Diſſolutions of Bodies. 3. By boiling of Water and other Liquors. 4. By the mutual Actions of ſome, eſpecially ſaline Bodies, upon one another. 5. By the Analyſes and Reſolutions of certain Subſtances.</p>
               <p>On <hi>January</hi> 17, we conveyed into a long and large <note place="margin">Experiment I.</note> Tube ſome Filings of Steel, and as much Water as was thought convenient to dilute the Oil of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> which we alſo conveyed in a peculiarly ſhap'd Glaſs, ſeal'd at both Ends, but with a Hole opened near one of them; the external Tube, and the Water in them being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Gage, which we had alſo included, being ſo far impelled up into the open Leg, that there was ſcarce any at all left in the ſeal'd one; this, I ſay, being done, the external Tube was by our way exactly cloſed: and then the Oil of <hi>Vitriol</hi> being by little and little, and at good Intervals of Time, poured out of the internal Tube, to actuate the Water, there were produced exceeding large Bubbles by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Solvent upon the Metal, which alſo produc'd a ſenſible Heat, though not a great one. When this
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:100378:17"/>
Conflict had laſted a while, we obſerved, in compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the chief Scope of this Experiment, whether there would be any ſpringy Air produced by all thoſe Bubbles; and we perceiv'd that there ſeem'd to be ſo much of it generated, that at length the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Gage was impell'd to the very bottom of the open Leg, and the Air included in the other ſeemed to be more compreſs'd than it had been when it was put in by the Weight of the Atmoſphere. But to try whether this Spring (wherein the Warmth, formerly mentioned, might be ſuſpected to have for that time ſome Intereſt) would continue, I removed the Tube into another Room where was no Chimny; and coming to look on it the next Day, did not take notice of any ſenſible Alteration in the Gage; and with the like Succeſs I viſited it for three or four Days: But then coming one Day to look upon it, I found the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the Gage to have aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about one Inch and an half, and about that quantity of Water to have got into the ſealed Leg; which incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned me ſo much the more to ſuſpect, that this Change in the Gage might have been accidental, a Boy having unknown to me removed the Tube from its wonted Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to place ſomewhat elſe there, without doing it heedfully enough. And this Conjecture ſeems the more likely, becauſe I have not ſeen any notable Change to have happened in the Gage from that time to this, (which is the <hi>25th</hi> of <hi>January</hi> at Night) the <hi>Mercury</hi> in the open Leg being about one Inch and an half.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> 8. A Glaſs Vial holding about a Pint (by gueſs) <note place="margin">Experiment: <hi>II.</hi>
                  </note> was filled with Wheat Flower, and as much Water as was ſufficient to drench it well. Afterwards the Orifice was exactly and ſtrongly cloſed with a Cork, and an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Cement: the Glaſs was ſet in a warm Place of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:100378:18"/>
Laboratory, becauſe of the Coldneſs of the Seaſon; and having ſtood there a Fortnight bating one Day, it this Morning broke by the mere Dilatation of the included Matter, whoſe viſible Part was laſt Night obſerv'd to leave a conſiderable Part unfill'd beneath the Cork. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice was taken by the Laborant of the Event of this Trial, by a Noiſe which yet was no louder than one made upon the burſting of the Glaſs into ſeveral Pieces: To my Taſte the included Matter was but a little ſou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, but another afterwards judged it to be mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly acid.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>March</hi> 9. Having on the <hi>23d</hi> of <hi>February</hi> put into a <note place="margin">Experiment <hi>III.</hi>
                  </note> pretty large Bolt-head a convenient Quantity of bruiſed Raiſons, with as much Water as I thought neceſſary to make them ferment; and having cauſed the Air to be carefully pump'd out, and taken ſufficient Order to keep any from forcing or ſtealing into the Glaſs, I ſet it in the Laboratory, that the Warmth of the Air might fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the Fermentation. At the end of four or five Days, it did not appear by a Mercurial Gage, (which had been purpoſely incloſed together with the Raiſons) that there was generated any ſpringy Subſtance. But being hindred by ſeveral Occaſions from looking after this Glaſs from time to time, it ſeems the contained Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor fermented more violently than the time of the Year would have made one expect: for about four of the Clock in the Afternoon, no body being in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boratory, the Glaſs flew in pieces with a loud Noiſe like the Report of a Piſtol; which alarming a Domeſtick of mine, that was in a Chamber not far off, made him ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten to the Laboratory, where he found the Raiſons thrown all about, and the middle part of the Bolt-head (for the Bottom and the Pipe were intire enough)
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:100378:18"/>
ſcattered into ſuch little Pieces, that they ſeemed almoſt to be vaniſhed.</p>
               <p>On the <hi>22d</hi> of <hi>February,</hi> I filled a Glaſs that had a <note place="margin">Experiment <hi>IV.</hi>
                  </note> ſomewhat wide Mouth, and might hold by Eſtimation three Pints (or Pounds) of Water; to which that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor, and a convenient Quantity of bruiſed Raiſons up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Orifice of the Glaſs, were tied the Neck of a pretty large Bladder, out of which the Air having been diligently expreſs'd, it was ſtrongly faſtned to our Glaſs with one of our cloſe Cements; ſo that by ſquee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing the Bladder, we could not perceive that any Air could get in or out. Then, this done, we left the Glaſs in a convenient Place in the Laboratory, till the <hi>8th</hi> or <hi>9th</hi> of <hi>March;</hi> and then finding the Bladder to be pump'd up, we would have tied up the contained Air, but could not do it by reaſon of an imperceiv'd Hole, perchance made with the Point of a Pin, by ſome one of them that handled it. Wherefore taking off this Bladder, we cauſed another that was very limber, to be put on after the manner newly deſcribed; and ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday Morning we found it, though by Eſtimation it might hold about two Pounds of Water, to be ſo full of Air, that we could not without difficulty, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing a pretty deal of the contain'd Air, tie the Bladder very cloſe near the Neck of it.</p>
               <p>And to try whether this ſame Mixture would conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to produce Air, (whether fermented or not, I muſt not here diſpute) I cauſed another Bladder to be faſtned to the ſame Glaſs as before, and found it this Morning <hi>March</hi> 11. as full as if it were diſtended with a Pair of Bellows.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>April</hi> 28. Into the bottom of a wide-mouth'd Vial we <note place="margin">Experiment <hi>V.</hi>
                  </note> put ſome good Spirit of Salt, and Filings of Steel, and
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:100378:19"/>
whelm'd over it a R<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. fitted with an Eel-skin and a Wire; to the latter of which was tied a thin Glaſs-Veſſel, her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metically ſeal'd at the bottom, tho 'twas but ſlender, and furniſhed with a competent Quantity of Filings of Copper, then we exhauſted the R<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. well with our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, and afterwards by thruſting the Glaſs that held the Filings againſt the bottom of the Vial, we broke it off, upon which the Filings fell into the Menſtruum, which acting upon them, there enſued good ſtore of Bubbles that made a Froth much deeper than was the Liquor, and the ſucceſſive Generation of theſe Bubbles continued a good while, and appear'd ſome of them large enough, though in the free Air they would ſcarce have been vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, or at leaſt would not have been taken notice of, the Vial having been kept in our <hi>Vacuum</hi> for a Quarter of an Hour longer, and no Greenneſs to be ſeen in the Liquor, the R<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. was taken off, and the Vial left open to the Air.</p>
               <p>A Bubble of Air, whoſe Diameter was near in length <note place="margin">Experiment <hi>VI.</hi>
                  </note> to that of a middle ſiz'd Pea, was left at the top of a round Vial with a long narrow Neck, whoſe Cavity was fill'd with fine Oil of Turpentine, and then being inverted into a Vial fill'd with the ſame Liquor, was ſet aſide in a quiet Place, and left there for a competent time. Another Vial ſhap'd like the former, but a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty deal leſs, was fill'd Neck and all with Alcohol of Wine, ſave a Bubble of Air about the ſame Bigneſs with the former: This Vial being inverted into another furniſh'd with the ſame Liquor, was ſet aſide in the ſame Window with it, and at the ſame time: The Event was, that about the End of the <hi>6th</hi> Day, the Bubble diſappear'd in the Glaſs that contain'd the Oil of Turpentine. And the like Abſorption, if I may ſo call it, I obſerv'd to have been made of the Air by the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:100378:19"/>
contiguous Spirit of Wine, the next Day after.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>May</hi> the <hi>23d.</hi> We open'd another exhauſted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, <note place="margin">Experiment <hi>VII.</hi>

But without nicely diſtinguiſhing the Grounds of particular Operations, we ſhall refer the Phenomena in general to the Moiſture of the Air, (or moiſt Air) that Quality being the moſt obvious to be obſerv'd in theſe Phenomena; in the Production of ſome of which it ſeems either the only, or the main Cauſe, in others an aſſiſtant Cauſe, and in all a not uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Concomitant.</p>
            <p>The Account upon which a Body is dry, being uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally but this, that the Pores intercepted between its more ſtable Parts, are not fill'd with any viſible Liquor, it is not to be expected that a Quality ſo near of kin to a Privation, ſhould furniſh much to our preſent hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Notes: But yet Drineſs may ſometimes have a not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inconſiderable Intereſt in the Changes of a Body, and that upon differing Scores, whereof I take theſe two to be the chief. <hi>1ſt.</hi> As the Body by Exſiccation is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of thoſe liquid and exhalable Parts that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore harbour'd in its Pores, and were perhaps the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of divers Operations aſcribed to it.

theſe Evaporable Parts by their Receſs may occaſion a Change of Texture in the Body, eſpecially in regard of the Pores, whoſe Bigneſs, Figure, and perhaps Poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being alter'd, the Body by this Change of Texture acquires a Diſpoſition to act, and be acted on, in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Caſes, otherwiſe than formerly.</p>

               </note> the Hygroſcope did not ſenſibly appear to grow heavier, and ſometimes it would preponderate when I took no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of no Vapours to make it do ſo: and though theſe things happen'd but ſeldom, in reſpect of the ordinary Changes of the Hygroſcope according to thoſe of the Weather; yet they made me ſuſpect that ſometimes the Clouds may conſiſt of other Steams than Aqueous, or that there may be ſome Exhalations that may have a peculiar Congruity with the Pores of the Hygroſcope, and whoſe Nature may be ſuch as to the Power of dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Hygroſcope, that upon theſe or ſome other, yet unheeded Accounts, the Steams that are ſometimes diffuſed in the Air, may controul the uſual and regular Cauſes of increaſing or leſſening the Gravity of the Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſcope. And this Suſpicion was the ſtronger, becauſe having made Hygroſcopes with Powder and Salt, and alſo with the Saw-duſt of Wainſcot, hung at nice Scales in very thin open Glaſſes, purpoſely blown for Lightneſs ſake at the Flame of a Lamp, though they uſually acquired and loſt Weight, as the Weather grew moiſter or drier, yet ſometimes they did not.</p>
            <p>At half of an Hour after nine a Clock at Night, I <note place="margin">Experiment <hi>I.</hi>
               </note> look'd upon the Half Hundred Weight that hung at the bottom of the Rope, the Weather being then fair, and a Mark being put at that part of the erected Board where the bottom of the Weight touch'd, I perceiv'd the Sky a while after to grow cloudy and overcaſt, but without
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:100378:22"/>
Rain; wherefore going to viſit the Weight again, I found it to be riſen ¼ of an Inch or more; and looking on my Watch, perceiv'd there had paſs'd an Hour and a Quarter ſince the Mark was made.</p>
            <p>This Morning I came again to look upon the Weight between eight and nine of the Clock, and found it raiſed above the newly mentioned Mark, made laſt Night about one Inch, (for 'twas about 9/10 of an Inch.) This Day the Weather being fair and windy, the Weight was fallen by ten at Night about ſix Inches beneath its Station, at which I found it when I look'd on it in the Morning.</p>
            <p>Being not well yeſter-night, the Weight was obſerv'd at Bed-time, by two of my Servants, and it then reſted at the <hi>11th</hi> of the erected Bound. This Morning about eight of the Clock, I viſited it my ſelf, and found it to be riſen about ⅛ of an Inch above the eighth Inch, the Morning being cloudy, though the Morning very dry and duſty. The Weather growing more overcaſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſomewhat leſs than an Hour after, I viſited the Weight again, ſome ſcatter'd Drops of Rain then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to fall, and found it to be riſen about half an Inch above the newly mention'd eighth Mark.</p>
            <p>I look'd when I was ready to go to Bed upon the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpended Weight of 56 Pound, and mark'd how low it reach'd upon the divided Board; and a great part of the Night having been rainy, I look'd again when I was dreſs'd in the Morning, which was about half an Hour after eight a Clock, and I found the Cord ſo ſhrunk, that the Weight was raiſed above five Inches higher than I left it the Night before; but the Day recovering dry and windy, and ſometimes warm, the Rope was ſo ſtretch'd, that at Night the Weight ſunk a good way beneath all the Marks. <hi>N.

               </gap> (Inch) in Diameter; this we ſuffer'd to be ſtretch'd for ſome Days by a Weight of Lead with an Iron Ring or Anſula, weighing a Quarter of an Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, according to the great Hundred, which is five ſcore and twelve: and then placing a flat Board under it ſo, that the Weight juſt reſted upon it, we had the Rope well wetted over them with a Spunge dip'd in Water, and ſo often applied to it, that the Liquor might be tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly ſoak'd into the Pores of the Rope, which at firſt ſeem'd thereby a little ſtretch'd, rather than ſhorten'd; but after an Hour or two it began to ſhrink, ſo that we could make the Weight ſwinge like a Pendulum over the Piece of Board it lean'd upon before. But after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſame Day the Weight ſtretch'd out the Rope again as much as formerly.</p>
            <p>'Tis obſervable, that though <hi>Morocco</hi> be an Inland-Town, and the Soil of thoſe Parts be uſually dry, if not parched; yet Doctor <hi>D.</hi> who was lately there, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, that about <hi>Morocco,</hi> notwithſtanding the violent Heats he felt in the Day-time, he obſerved the Noctur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Air to be very damp, ſo as to make the Clothes he put off at Night exceeding moiſt, and unfit to be worn without airing the next Morning. He added, That though the Air was very piercing, and manifeſted it ſelf to be ſo by many other Signs, yet it would not make his Knife ruſt in his Pocket, or his Sword in the Scabbard, though it would quickly produce a Ruſt in Inſtruments of that Metal expoſed naked to it.</p>
            <p>Air too moiſt cannot be wholeſome. The Air in our Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> about <hi>Oakly</hi> in <hi>Buckingham-ſhire,</hi> though a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:100378:23"/>

Mr. <hi>J. T.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As in another Experiment wetried, whether or no the Removal of the Air out of the Receiver would much alter the Temperature of the included Medium or Space, as to Heat and Cold: ſo we indeavour'd to diſcover, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Alteration would be notable, as to Drineſs and Moiſture. To this purpoſe we did indeed wiſh for ſuch a Hygroſcope (or Inſtrument wherewith to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the Moiſture and Drineſs of the Air) as we uſed many Years ago, and ſince found well deſcribed by the induſtrious <hi>Kircher,</hi> in a Place of his <hi>Ars magnetica,</hi> to which I therefore refer your Lordſhip. But in regard that to this Inſtrument there is requiſite the Beard of a wild Oat ſeaſonably gather'd, which we could not then procure; we recall'd to Mind another Hygroſcope, which, though it diſcover not ſuch ſmall Mutations as the former, we thought might be uſefully enough ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticuted inſtead of it.</p>
            <p>Of this Hygroſcrope, having particularly deſcribed it in another Paper, we ſhall now only ſay in a word, that 'tis made by faſtning to the upper End of a Piece of Gut-ſtring, or great Luteſtring, a very light Index, and ſtrongly faſtning the lower end of the ſame String
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:100378:24"/>
to the bottom of a Box, or other convenient Frame, the Circumference of whoſe upper Part may be at pleaſure divided into Degrees or other Partitions, upon which the Index may move to and fro. For the Inſtrument being thus made, when the Air grows moiſter, the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours inſinuating themſelves into the Pores of the Fila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that compoſe the String, do ſomewhat ſhorten it; and thereby thoſe Filaments being altered in point of Contortion, the Index that is faſtned to them turns one way: and upon the receſs of thoſe Vapours, or of others of like nature, the String comes to be wreath'd, and conſequently the Index to be moved another way. So that in a String of about three Inches long, the Point of the Index will be oftentimes made to change its Place very notably, by ſuch a mutation of the Air, as to Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Moiſture, as was to be met with in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and at Noon of the ſame Day, tho ſuch a Change did not always need either Rain, Clouds or Miſts, or the abſence of them, to make it notable.</p>
            <p>We took then one of theſe Hygroſcopes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed it into a ſmall Receiver, that the removal of the <note place="margin">Experiment III.</note> Air being ſudden, the Change of Temperature (if any ſhould happen) in the exhauſted Cavity, might be the more ſudden and conſpicuous. But we found not that the emptying of the Receiver made the Index ſenſibly change place. And though this Experiment were care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully made, yet for the greater Security we repeated it once more; and neither then perceiving the Index to remove, we kept the Receiver exhauſted for a pretty while, leſt there ſhould be ſome more time requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to the Operation of the Medium upon the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. But neither did this Trial produce any ſenſible Alteration of the Index; but after the Key was turned, and Acceſs was thereby given to the excluded Air, tho
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:100378:24"/>
the Cover were ſtill kept on, we found that then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſome Hours, the Index was conſiderably removed. So that as far as theſe Experiments informed us, the Ether or ſubtile Matter that ſucceeds in the place deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Air, if that Place be not left void; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the thinner and more fluid part of the Atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere (in which the Corpuſcles, that may be more properly called Aerial, ſwim) ſeems in its own nature to be very ſenſibly, neither cold, or hot, or dry, or moiſt. I ſaid, as far as theſe Experiments, I mean thoſe we made in this Engine with the Thermoſcope and Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſcope, inform us: becauſe this Conjecture (for I dare yet call it no more) may be examined divers other ways, whoſe Events may either confirm, or oppoſe, or limit it. In the mean time I could wiſh, that if your Lordſhip had one of <hi>Kircher</hi>'s Hygroſcopes at hand, you would frequently and carefully try the laſt-recited Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment with it; becauſe I have found, that if ſuch a Hygroſcope be very well made, 'tis admirable, as well as pleaſant, to ſee how ſmall a Mutation of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Air it will take notice of. But I thought fit to deſire to have it frequently tried, becauſe Care muſt be taken that ſuch Motions of the Index be not miſtaken for the Effects of the altered Temper of the Medium in the Receiver, which may in ſome Caſes proceed from thoſe Steams of the Oil and Water, which we elſewhere mention, that we now and then, tho but ſeldom, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to get out of the Cylinder into the Receiver, and play up and down there.</p>

               <p>Of <hi>Salts</hi> in the Air.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>'TIS ſufficiently known that the Peripatetick Schools teach the Air to be an Element warm and moiſt; and if it be an Element, it ought, according to their Principles, and thoſe of the greateſt part of other Naturaliſts, to be a ſimple and Homoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous Body. But becauſe ſuch an elementary or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Purity is much eaſier to be found in the Writings of Schoolmen, than amongſt the Works of Nature, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the modern Philoſophers have juſtly forſaken this Doctrine of the elementary Simplicity of the Air in ſome meaſure; but perhaps very few of them, if any, have aſſerted the Air to be ſo exceedingly compounded a Body, as in my Opinion it really is. For divers of them grant indeed, that the Atmoſphere is not abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely pure, but yet think, that it differs but gradually from true and ſimple Air, as Water a little moved and troubled does from clear and ſettled Water. But for my part, I confeſs I acquieſce not in either of thoſe Notions of the Air. For, as I have elſewhere more fully declared in a ſhort Diſcourſe, purpoſely treating of the Subſtance of the Air, although I will not deny that there is an Ethereal Matter more ſubtile than the common Air, which Ether I take to be diffuſed through all the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtellar Part of the Univerſe known to us, reaching to and ſurrounding all its great Globles; yet ſpeaking of the Air which we Men live and breath in, I take our
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:100378:27"/>
Atmoſphere to conſiſt not only of the purer Ether, but in great part of a vaſt multitude of <hi>Effluvia</hi> emitted by the Terraqueous Globe, and the various Bodies it is made up of, and perhaps in ſome part alſo of ſubſtantial Emanations from the Celeſtial Bodies; and that that whereby the Atmoſphere differs from ſuch pure Air, as the Schools tell us of, is not a bare and indeterminate Feculency, but a confuſed Aggregate of ſeveral diſtinct and perhaps diſagreeing kinds of <hi>Effluvia.</hi> And amongſt thoſe, one of the principal ſorts I take to be the <hi>Saline ones,</hi> which rove up and down amongſt others in that vaſt Ocean of Effluxions, we call the Atmoſphere: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in yet I do not think there are to be met with, either all ſorts of them every where, or perhaps any ſort in like Plenty, in all Places, and at all Seaſons.</p>
            <p>To ſhew that the Air is not unfurniſhed with Parts of a ſaline Nature, I might alledg ſome Conſiderations that ſeem to make it probable <hi>à priori,</hi> as they ſpeak, that there are always ſome ſuch Corpuſcles emitted into the Air. But inſtead of inſiſting on ſuch Particulars, becauſe they may ſeem too little of an Hiſtorical Nature, to be fit for this Paper, I ſhall content my ſelf to take notice in the general, that almoſt (if not more than almoſt) all the Arguments I have employed, to prove the copious Aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſubterraneal Steams into the Air, may be applied to our preſent Purpoſe, ſince amongſt the <hi>effluviating</hi> Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Terraqueous Globe, there are, as I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in another Paper, huge quantities of common or Marine Salt, beſides Nitrous, Aluminous, Vitriolate, and perhaps other kinds of Salts. To which I ſhall add, that the emiſſion of Subterraneal Aporrheas or Effluxes, is not the only Means whereby the Air may be impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with ſaline Particles; ſince the Exhalations and Vapours produced by the Action of the Sun-beams upon
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:100378:27"/>
the more ſuperficial Parts of the Earth and Sea, may ſupply the Air with Swarms of Corpuſcles, as well of ſaline, as of any other Nature. Not to mention that the Number of theſe may, in divers Places, be much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, by thoſe Vulcans, that have open Vents to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge their Fumes into the Air; by thoſe numerous Fires which burning in our Chimnies, produce much ſaline Smoak; and by other ways, which I ſhall here forbear to diſcourſe of, for the Reaſon lately given for my declining Arguments drawn <hi>à priori:</hi> though ſome things applicable to this purpoſe, will in likelihood occur amongſt the Inſtances I am about to add, to make it ſeem probable <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> or by ſome Effects and Phenomena, that the Air is impregnated with ſaline Corpuſcles, that are none of its leaſt active Parts, and may have great Intereſt in divers of its Operations.</p>
            <p>From what has been hitherto delivered, to make it probable that there is a ſaline Subſtance in the Air, I thought fit to proceed to other Inquiries. The firſt; Whether the Aerial Salts be of differing kind? and if ſo, which they are? And the ſecond; How it comes by its ſaline Subſtance? But about ſuch differing Points I durſt promiſe <hi>my ſelf</hi> but little Satisfaction, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhall not pretend to give <hi>you</hi> much.</p>
            <p>And yet, to ſay ſomething to the firſt of the two In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, I am prone to think, that the ſaline Particles of the Atmoſphere are not all of one ſort, but that there may be three or four differing kinds of Aerial Salts.</p>
            <p>I know that divers learned Men, ſome Phyſicians, ſome Chymiſts, and ſome alſo Philoſophers, ſpeak much of a <hi>Volatile Nitre,</hi> that abounds in the Air, as if that were the only Salt wherewith it is impregnated. But though I agree with them, in thinking that the Air is in many Places impregnated with Corpuſcles of

a Nitrous Nature; yet I confeſs I have not been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto convinc'd of all that is wont to be delivered a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Plenty and Quality of the Nitre in the Air: For I have not found, that thoſe that build ſo much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this volatile Nitre, have made out by any compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Experiment, that there is ſuch a volatile Nitre a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounding in the Air. For having often dealt with Salt-peter in the Fire, I do not find it eaſy to be raiſed by a gentle Heat; and when by a ſtronger Fire, we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil it in cloſe Veſſels, 'tis plain that what the Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts call <hi>Spirit of Nitre,</hi> has quite differing Properties from crude Nitre, and from thoſe that are aſcribed to the volatile Nitre of the Air; theſe Spirits being ſo far from being refreſhing to the Nature of Animals, that they are exceeding corroſive: And even when I cauſed Earth to be dug up in an old Pigeon-Houſe, becauſe that is accounted the moſt nitrous ſort of Earth, and diſtill'd it with moderate Fires, I did not find the vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile ſaline Parts, that came over, to be like that, which theſe learned Men conceive the Air to be ſtored with. Nor have I met with among them any poſitive Proof, to evince the Truth of their Opinion; which yet, as I was ſaying, I am content to admit as an ingenious Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, 'till ſomething be offered that ſhall prove it to be more; which I think not impoſſible to happen, at leaſt as to ſome Times and Places. But I am not yet ſure, that the Exhalations, that aſcend from the ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal Parts, and perhaps alſo the Sun-Beams themſelves, may volatilize many of the nitrous Corpuſcles they chance to act upon, and elevate them into the Air, without analyzing them, or deſtroying their Texture, as our Fires are wont to do. But however, I do not take the hitherto mention'd Nitre to be the only Salt, that impregnates the Air: For when I conſider how
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:100378:28"/>
vaſt a Portion of the Terraqueous Globe is cover'd with the ſalt Sea, and how vaſt Quantities of foſſile Salt, as well fine and clear, as courſe, are dug up in <hi>Poland,</hi> eſpecially near <hi>Cracovia;</hi> in <hi>Hungary, Tranſylvania,</hi> and in divers other Parts of the Earth: When I conſider too, that we ſeldom find Salt-peter in the Earth, but that there is Sea-Salt mix'd with it, which puts the Salt-peter-men to a great deal of Trouble to ſeparate it; and that even from Salt-peter, that paſſes for good, I had Trouble enough, when I had the Curioſity pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely to refine it, to free the purely Nitrous from the other ſaline Particles: I am prone to ſuſpect, that in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry many Places, eſpecially maritime ones, the <hi>Effluvia</hi> of common Salt do, at leaſt as plentifully as thoſe of Salt-peter, abound in, or impregnate the Air: which Conjecture might be favoured by divers things, if I had leiſure to inſiſt on them.</p>
            <p>That in ſome Places, that abound with Marchaſites, there is a kind of fretting Vitriolate Salt, copiouſly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed through the Air, I have been inclin'd to think, partly by other Inducements, and partly by the Anſwers made me by a very obſerving Man, who liv'd in a Place, that I remember I viſited; where being forced to reſide a good while, he found the Hangings of his Chamber, and the Curtains of his Bed, rotted by the Vitriolate Steams expir'd by the Soil, whoſe <hi>Effluvia</hi> had alſo very manifeſt and unwelcome Effects, on di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other things, that were kept near that Place; tho on the oppoſite Side of the River, in a Town that is not half a Mile diſtant from this Place, neither I, at my being there, heard any ſuch thing complain'd of, nor the Relator, who had often occaſion to repair thither, obſerv'd any ſuch miſchievous Effects; the Soil of this latter Place being chalky; whereas the other above
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:100378:29"/>
mentioned is vitriolate, inſomuch that he obſerv'd, that when the moiſt and blackiſh Mould had been beaten upon by the Sun, that here and there the ſuperficial Parts would be as 'twere beſprinkled with a ſomewhat whitiſh ſaline Effloreſcence.</p>
            <p>Beſides the hitherto-mention'd kinds of Salts, it ſeems not improbable to me, that the Air (eſpecially about great Towns, and ſome other particular Places) may be impregnated with volatile Salts, that are of a Nature contrary to Acids. For that there may be Places in the Earth, even at a good Depth under Ground, that lodg ſuch Salts, I have been induced to think by the Experience of an Acquaintance of mine: who, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to find in the Salt of what he ſuppoſed to be Virgin-Earth, the true Receptacle of an univerſal Spirit, from which he promiſed himſelf great and profitable Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, cauſed to be dug up a great deal of a certain Clay, in a Place abounding with Minerals, and obtain'd thence by mere Diſtillation, no inconſiderable Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Spirit and Salt, which in divers Qualities, as Smell, Taſte, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I judg'd to be near of kin to the Spirit of Urine or Hartſhorn. And yet this Earth was dug up at the Depth of many Feet, not to ſay Yards, beneath the Surface of the Ground, (as an ingenious Potter, from whom the Chymiſt had the Clay, aſſur'd me upon the Place it ſelf) which I once viſited, to ſee ſome other choice Minerals, that innobled that Soil; whence I would have got a Quantity of the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Clay, but that it being then the midſt of Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the Rain had (as the Workmen ſpeak) drowned <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Pit.</p>
            <p>In great Cities, and alſo Towns, where much Wood is burnt, 'tis probable that numerous Particles of vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Salt may be diſperſed through the neighbouring
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:100378:29"/>
Air. For, as I have elſewhere ſhewn, the Soot of burn'd Wood, which is but that ſmall part of the Smoak which chances in its paſſage upwards to ſtick to the Chimny, does very much abound in a volatile ſaline Spirit, which by many Trials are found to have ſo much Affinity to that of Urine and of Hartſhorn, as not to be eaſily, but by the Smell diſtinguiſhed from it.</p>
            <p>Beſides, in ſeveral Places the Putrefaction of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that once were Parts of animal Bodies, may fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Air with volatile Salts, as I have elſewhere mentioned, that I found, that Urine, without Diſtilla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will by bare Putrefaction afford ſaline and ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Parts, that, whilſt they yet ſwim in the copious Phlegm, that makes up the Body of the Liquor, will manifeſtly diſcover themſelves to be volatile, not only by their Smell, but by their hiſſing with acid Spirits, and by their diſſolving ſome Bodies, and precipitating others, according to the manner of volatile ſulphureous Salts, as thoſe that abound in Spirit of Hartſhorn, Blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And I am apt to think, that 'tis not only in the parts of Animals, but alſo in thoſe of many Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, that Putrefaction may either extricate or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce volatile Salts. And I remember, I have obſerv'd in ſome ſucculent Vegetables, that chancing to lie in a Heap together, in a convenient Seaſon of the Year, to make them rot; I obſerv'd, I ſay, when the Putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction was come to a certain Point, that the Stink did ſo reſemble that of Carrion, that 'twas not eaſy for me to believe it came from Cadaverous Plants, not A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals. And that 'tis not impoſſible for a Vegetable to afford, without the Help of an Additament, a volatile Salt, even <hi>in forma ſicca,</hi> may be gathered from what I elſewhere relate, of my having diſtill'd ſuch a Salt from a certain ſpirituous Seed, though I freely confeſs, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:100378:30"/>
obtained any (without previous Incineration) from above two or three Vegetables. But of this enough in this Place.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now add, that beſides the more ſimple Salts hitherto enumerated, 'tis not unlikely, that in ſome Places the Air may ſometimes contain compounded Salts. For I have elſewhere ſhewn, that ſome ſorts of ſaline Spirits, meeting one another in the Air, may there convene. And I elſewhere teach how to order a couple of Liquors ſo, that one will never of it ſelf af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford any thing in a dry form; and yet the ſpirituous <hi>Effluvia</hi> of this Liquor, meeting with thoſe of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, will exhibite a volatile and ſaline Body in a dry form; though the Liquors themſelves being mingled, will not afford any ſuch Subſtance. What I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where delivered concerning ſubterraneal Steams, may make it probable, that at leaſt now and then, and in ſome Places, there may be ſent up from under Ground into the Air, among other <hi>Effluvia,</hi> ſtore of ſaline ones, which needs not be ſuppoſed all of them to be of an uncompounded Nature. With which that agrees very well, that was related to me by a very intelligent Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance of mine, that liv'd long in Parts of <hi>America,</hi> where there was a <hi>Vulcan,</hi> which he and ſome others having the Curioſity to viſit, told me, that before they came any thing near the Fire, or were offended by the Heat, not only the Skin of his Face was almoſt cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roded by the Sharpneſs of the Exhalations, but the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of his Hair was alter'd by it; which kept him from proſecuting his intended Diſcovery. 'Tis a known thing, and I have received Information of it from more than one Eye-witneſs, that about <hi>Mount Veſuvius,</hi> the aſcending Exhalations, that iſſue out at ſome of the Holes, are of ſo ſaline and ſulphureous a Nature, that
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:100378:30"/>
part of them ſtick about the Orifices of thoſe Vents, in the form of Flower of Brimſtone; of which a learned Acquaintance of mine brought away ſome Quantity. And I have had brought me from ſome of thoſe Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, a Stone, whoſe Caveties abounded with a white Salt, which, by fit Trials purpoſely made, was found near a-kin to <hi>Sal-Armoniac,</hi> and eaſily reſoluble into a Salt, whereof one part was ſomewhat fix'd, and the other very volatile, which made it highly probable, that the Salt was compounded in the Bowels of the Vulcan: whence I have been credibly inform'd, that great Quantities of it have been caſt up in the fiery E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and therefore Store of it might in Likelihood be diſperſed through the Air, ſince I found the Salt it ſelf to be ſublimable.</p>
            <p>But, beſides the ſaline Subſtances hitherto mention'd, which may be referr'd to determinate <hi>Species,</hi> I think it not impoſſible, that the Air may, at leaſt in ſome Times and Places, be impregnated with Corpuſcles of a ſaline Nature, whether ſimple, or compounded, or of both kinds, not eaſily reducible to any of the ſorts, we have been ſpeaking of, or are acquainted with. For which Reaſon I ſhall not preſume to give them any other De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination, than that indefinite one of <hi>Anonymous.</hi> And I have been inclin'd to think, there may be ſuch Bodies in the Air, by theſe two Inducements. The firſt; That the particular aerial Salts, that have been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto recited, are but few, as it ſeems probable, by what I have ſaid in other Papers of ſubterraneal Steams and <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments;</hi> and that therefore there may aſcend out of the Earth into the Air, ſaline Fumes differing enough from thoſe, whoſe kinds we have hitherto deſcrib'd. But beſides this Conſideration <hi>à priori,</hi> (as they ſpeak) Experience has preſented us with ſome <hi>Phenomena,</hi> that
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:100378:31"/>
ſeems <hi>à poſteriori</hi> to confirm this Conjecture. For there happen ſuch Changes to ſome Bodies, by being expoſed to the Air, as, though I am not ſure, and therefore ſhall not be confident, that they are mainly produc'd by ſome nameleſs Subſtance of a ſaline Nature, may yet make it allowable to ſuſpect them to proceed thence. And amongſt theſe I ſhall take leave to inſert ſome, which I deny not to be probably referrable, either to one or other of the formerly enumerated kinds of aerial Saltneſs. For laying theſe Inſtances before you toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they may, by appearing thus aſſociated, give the ſtronger Probability to our Opinion, that there are ſaline Subſtances in the Air. And thoſe Inſtances, that are not ſo proper to perſwade you, that there are ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous Salts, may ſerve to confirm that there are, at leaſt in divers Places, differing ſorts of aerial Salts. I remember I have more than once viſited old Glaſs-win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, in high and ancient Buildings, and found ſome of the Panes of Glaſs here and there corroded, as if they had been worm-eaten; which probably enough ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued the ſharp and fretting Corpuſcles, to have been carried along with the Winds to which they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, as will not eaſily be reduced to any formerly nam'd Salts, whoſe being unable to corrode Glaſs, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially no finer than that was I ſpeak of, is ſufficiently known to Chymiſts.</p>
            <p>Beſides the above-mention'd <hi>Phenomena,</hi> others have occurr'd to me, which poſſibly 'twould not be thought impertinent to ſubjoin on this occaſion; but I chuſe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to reſerve them for another Diſcourſe; and now ſhould put an End to this, but that I dare not conceal from you, that I ſometimes had Thoughts of trying, whether a Diſcovery may not be made, what kind of Saltneſs there is to be found in the Air, and whether
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:100378:31"/>
the aerial Saltneſs does or does not abound there, at leaſt at this or that time. But this I freely confeſs to be ſo difficult an Attempt, that all that I can offer pretends but to diſſwade you from rejecting it, as too deſperate and extravagant a thing to be fit to be tried.</p>
            <p>And I ſpeak the leſs promiſingly of what I am to ſay in the remaining part of this Paper, becauſe I have not by me any Notes to aſſiſt my Memory, (which I dare not truſt alone) concerning the Iſſues of the not numerous Trials, I had Opportunity to attempt in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of thoſe Thoughts. This I well remember, that among other ways of making the intended aerial Diſcoveries, I look'd upon this as the leaſt unpromiſing, that ſuch Subjects ſhould be carefully choſen out, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpoſed to be differingly wrought upon, according to the differing ſorts of Saltneſs, that may be found pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in the Air.</p>
            <p>This more general way of inveſtigating the Salts of the Air, may contain divers particular Methods, of which I ſhall now touch upon the following three.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It may be worth while, to expoſe to the Air ſuch Bodies, as we judg fitteſt to be wrought upon by the Salt, that we think likelieſt to be met with in it. So where we gueſs the Air to be impregnated with Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, we may expoſe Lime to it, or ſome other Body that we think diſpoſed to imbibe or retain ſuch a Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. We may alſo hang up in ſuch an Air, Clothes or Silks died with ſuch Colours, that Nitrous (for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) or Salino-Sulphureous Spirits (as ſome Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts call them) have been found peculiarly apt to make to fade, or to diſcolour them. In the Places where we ſuſpect vitriolate Steams to abound, ſome appropriated Preparations of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> either common or metalline, may be expoſed to try whether they will acquire a Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:100378:32"/>
as I have ſeveral times found ſome of thoſe Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phurs, though otherwiſe of no dark Colour, to do, upon the leaſt Contact of vitriolate Corpuſcles. In ſome Places alſo, which are judg'd likely to afford ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terraneal Steams, gueſſes may be made, whether this or that kind of Salt aſcends into the Air, by ſpreading upon the Ground, in Places free from Dirt and Duſts, large Pieces of clean and white Linen Cloth, that has no Reliſh of Sope or Lees; and obſerving, after they have lain a competent while, whether, and how they are diſcoloured, and what kind of Saltneſs, if any, is to be found in the Moiſture imbib'd by them, from the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending Steams and falling Dew.</p>
            <p>The next of the above-mention'd ways of inquirng after the Saltneſs of the Air, may be, to find, if it be poſſible, ſome one Body, that is both capable to be wrought on by ſeveral aerial Salts, and will be ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feringly wrought on by them, as to diſcover which kind of Salt it is, that has produc'd the Change. That 'tis very difficult to find ſuch a Body, I will readily grant, but that it may be poſſible I will not be forward to deny. For having pitch'd upon Copper to make this Trial with, though the Attempt did not ſucceed according to my Wiſh, yet perhaps it was chiefly for want of Time and Accommodations that it miſcarried. For having taken Plates of Copper beaten thin, (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <note place="margin">Experiment <hi>I.</hi>
               </note> regarding their Bigneſs, or Figure, or Smoothneſs, as things not neceſſary to my purpoſe) I cauſed the Surfaces to be made very clean, that the Colours might be the more eaſily produced, and the better diſcerned; then, keeping theſe over Glaſſes wherein were placed divers Spirits, as of common Salt, and of Nitre, partly ſincere, and partly diluted with Water, I obſerv'd, as I expected, that though I put the Glaſſes in no Heat, yet
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:100378:32"/>
there aſcended fretting Particles out of the Liquors, and that within leſs than a Day, the Steams of the two above-mention'd Liquors had much darken'd the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faces of the Copper Plates, they met with in their way, the keeping them a while in the Air was not hard to know by the differing Diſcolorations that appear'd, which Plate had been invaded by the ſaline Corpuſcles, and which by the nitrous: Which I did not at all won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at, becauſe I have formerly found, as I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where noted, that whereas Spirit of Nitre will make of Copper a greeniſh blew Solution, Spirit of Salt will, if duly imployed, diſſolve that Metal into a graſs-green Liquor; as the Spirit of Soot and that of Urine will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a deep Blew, almoſt like Ultramarine. But, as I ſaid, the want of Time, of which good ſtore may be requiſite for ſuch Trials, kept me from proſecuting my Attempt to an Iſſue. Notwithſtanding which I look not upon the Deſign as deſperate, not only becauſe of the Incouragement I have already mention'd to reſume it: But becauſe I have obſerv'd Pieces of malleable Copper, brought me, to examine, out of an Engliſh Mine, (which is yet conceal'd) to be overcaſt here and there with a fair Verdigreaſe, which by Circumſtances I judg'd to have been produc'd, not by groſs Liquors, but by the Air impregnated with Steams fit to work on that Metal. And poſſibly there may be other ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neal Bodies, and even metalline ones, that by their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Colour, or peculiar kind of Ruſt or Stain, that they will acquire in the Air, may help us to gueſs, what Subſtances, and among others what Salts the Air of that Place is impregnated with. I have been in a great and ſtately Houſe, which being oddly ſeated, had this peculiar Inconvenience, upon the Score of the Steams that infeſted the Air, that thoſe that dwelt in it, as one
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:100378:33"/>
of the chief of themſelves complained to me, could not keep their Silver Plate, of which they had great Store, from being blemiſhed by odd Diſcolorations, or as they ſeem'd to think it, Ruſt; though when it was not uſed, they carefully kept it in a Place judg'd convenient for ſuch a Purpoſe. And I have been informed by an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Man who liv'd there ſome time, that there is nothing more generally known in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> than that their Silver Plate there, expoſed a little while to the common Air, tarniſhes immediately, contracting a dirty Colour, partaking of yellow and black. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtance or two, though not afforded by Plate, I could mention to the ſame Purpoſe; but I reſerve them for another Place; my Haſte obliging me to paſs on to the laſt of the three ways I propoſed, of inveſtigating the Differences of aerial Salts.</p>
            <p>The third way may be look'd upon, if you pleaſe, as a Variation of the ſecond; but there is this Difference betwixt them, that here we make uſe of metalline Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, not crude, but already prepared by ſome Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Operations; ſo that being before-hand reduc'd to very ſmall Parts, by the Intervention of ſaline Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, the Operation of the Air upon them is wont to be much the ſooner performed. In this third way then we imploy ſuch factititious Minerals or other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, as having for the moſt Part an adventitious Colour already, will change that Colour by being expoſed to the Air. For it ſeems not impoſſible, but that by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently obſerving what Difference may be found in the Diſcolorations, produc'd in theſe Subſtances by the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering kinds of Salts, as Nitrous, Salino-Sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that we have ſhewn may be met with in the Air, ſome gueſſes may be made in a ſhort time of this or that Salt, which has the chief Stroak in the Producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:100378:33"/>
of the exhibited Colour. And I ſhall on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion mention two or three Bodies, without determining, till I be better ſatisfied, whether their Changes proceed only or chiefly from the Salt of the Air; but I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent not to pretermit them, becauſe if they do not prove what I propoſe, they will at leaſt clear the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, and may however help us to gueſs at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance or Difference of Airs in ſeveral Places, by the Likeneſs or Unlikeneſs of the produc'd Changes of Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, whether theſe Changes proceed from ſaline, or from any other Subſtance intermingled with the Air.</p>
            <p>If we precipitate a ſtrong Solution of good Silver <note place="margin">Experiment <hi>II.</hi>
               </note> made in <hi>Aqua fortis,</hi> with a competent Quantity of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Sea-Salt, we ſhall have a Pouder, which at firſt will be very white; but if the Liquor be not poured off, this being expoſed for a good while to the Air, it would acquire on the Surface a dark Colour, which perhaps an attentive Eye will diſcern ſomewhat vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as this or that kind of Saltneſs happens to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant in the Air.</p>
            <p>We took an equal Weight of good Filings of Copper, <note place="margin">Experiment <hi>III.</hi>
               </note> and pouder'd Sal-Armoniac, which being well mix'd, were put into a cover'd Crucible, and kept in a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Fire over ignited Coals, till the Sal-Armoniac had either quite or almoſt done ſmoaking; then as much of the remaining Maſs as could be parted, was taken out, and look'd of a dark Colour; but this Maſs being groſly beaten, and expoſed for ſome time to the Air, look'd like a kind of Verdigreaſe, which is a Subſtance, whoſe Colour may be obſerv'd ſomewhat to vary, according to the Nature of the particular Salts, which by work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, and imbodying with the Copper, produce the Pigment. But a Parcel of the ſame Maſs being, before the Air had time to work much upon it, groſly pou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:100378:34"/>
and hermetically ſeal'd in a glaſs Egg, to fence it from the Air, and left in a South Window, did not appear diſcoloured, when the out ſide of the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel ſhew'd like Verdigreaſe: which ſeems to argue, the Change of Colour to have been made by the aerial Salt, if we ſuppoſe the Moiſture of the Airto have had no Intereſt in the Change, or to have concurr'd to it, but as a kind of Vehicle aſſiſtent to the Salt.</p>
            <p>I alſo took Spirit of the Soot of Wood, and having <note place="margin">Experiment <hi>IV.</hi>
               </note> poured a little of it on the Filings of Copper, my Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations were anſwer'd by my finding, that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor diſſolved ſome Parts of the Metal into a deep and lovely Azur like Ultramarine; and that this Solution being ſuffer'd to grow dry in an open Glaſs, by the the mere Operation of the Air, the <hi>Ceruleous</hi> Colour very ſoon degenerated, even before the matter was quite dry, into a <hi>Cyanious</hi> Colour, ſuch as may be ſeen in good Turquoiſes. And to manifeſt that this Change proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not from any Peculiarity in the Spirit of Soot, and that this Spirit acted as abounding with a Salino-ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Salt; I ſhall add, that I had the like Succeſs in a Trial made with an urinous Spirit drawn from animal Subſtances, and put upon crude Filings of Copper. And in thoſe Trials I ſometimes obſerv'd the Differences of Colours, that did not diſcourage me from hoping, that the Proſecution of them might not be inſignificant to my Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I have not been ſolicitous to deſcribe the fore-mention'd Changes of Colours more particularly, becauſe it had been very difficult to do ſo, and therefore I judg'd it more expedient not to attempt it. For there is ſo great a Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Colours, that few but Painters can exactly enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate, and diſtinguiſh them by proper Names. And yet, beſides thoſe more noted ones, there are many
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:100378:34"/>
others, for which, though our Language, nor perhaps any other, is not copious enough to furniſh us with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Appellations, yet our Eyes, eſpecially when they have been attentively converſant with ſuch Objects, are ſharp enough to diſcern them: and by the Help of theſe nameleſs, as well as the ſtated Colours, I am apt to think a heedful Obſerver may perceive divers Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Colours of the Bodies, we have been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, that may aſſiſt him to gueſs, what Subſtance it is in the Air whereto theſe Diverſities may be aſcribed. And as Nature is much more rich in Things, than our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionaries are in Words, ſo has ſhe furniſhed Men with Senſories capable of diſtinctly perceiving a far greater Variety of Objects, than they are able verbally to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs. And this might be ſhewn by Inſtances, in the Organs and Objects of Senſes leſs acute than Sight, whoſe Subtilty in diſtinguiſhing things I could exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plify, not only by what is related, but by what has been perform'd by ſome Perſons, not unknown to me, particularly our famous Doctor <hi>Harvey.</hi> But Examples of this kind I have not leiſure to ſtay on; and therefore without ſpending more Words upon this third way of diſcovering aerial Salts, I ſhall barely recommend the Care of ſuch Obſervations to their Curioſity, who ſhall think it worth while to make them.</p>
            <p>With how little Confidence of Succeſs, Trials that have the Aims of thoſe I have been ſpeaking of, are to be attempted, not only Conſideration, but Experience hath made me ſenſible. But yet I would not diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage humane Curioſity from adventuring even upon ſlight Probabilities, where the Nobleneſs of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and Scope may make even ſmall Attainments very deſirable. Thoſe adventurous Navigators that have made Voyages for Diſcovery in unknown Seas, when
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:100378:35"/>
they firſt diſcern'd ſomething of obſcure near the Hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zon, at a great Diſtance off, have often doubted, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what they had ſo imperfect a Sight of, were a Cloud, or an Iſland, or a Mountain: But though uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally it were more likely to be the former, (as that which more frequently occurr'd than the latter) yet they judg'd it adviſable to ſtere towards it, till they had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a clearer Proſpect of it: For if it were a delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Meteor, they would not however ſuſtain ſuch a Loſs in that of no great Labour, as in caſe it were a Country, they would in the Loſs of what might prove a noble and rich Diſcovery. And if they deſiſted too ſoon from their Curioſity, they could not rationally ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſy themſelves, whether they ſlighted a Cloud, or neglected a Country.</p>
            <p>I do not perceive that the Air of our Inland Parts is conſiderably impregnated with Eſurine Salt; ſince I do not find the Barrs and Caſements of our Windows much impaired by Ruſt after near eighty Years ſtanding; or that they are more ruſty towards one Quarter than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; though the Air hereabout (viz. <hi>Oakly</hi> in <hi>Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-ſhire)</hi> is very damp about the End of Autumn, and Beginning of Winter. So that I conceive this Salt either proceeds from the Sea-Vapours near the Sea-Coaſts, or elſe from the Diſſolution of this Eſurine Salt in the Air, upon the burning of Sea or other mineral Coles.

            <p>A learned Obſerver, who practiſed Phyſick in one of the moſt Southern of the Engliſh Colonies, being ask'd

by me about the Effects of the Air there upon Iron; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to me, that the great Guns there are ſo ſubject to become ruſty, that after they have lain a very few Years in the Air, one may with a Hammer knock off whole Scales, or rather Cakes of <hi>Crocus Murtis:</hi> and he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, that thoſe Guns, that lay only expos'd to the Air, did this much more than thoſe that by Accidents were drown'd, and lay cover'd with the ſalt Water.</p>

And when I demanded whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he taſted the Dew, to obſerve the Saltneſs of it? he replied, that he had not, but that he had in divers Places obſerv'd, that it left the Graſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that it had reſted on, cover'd over with a pure white Salt, as if it had been a hoar Froſt.</p>

He further told me, that he ſometimes for Curioſity ſake, cauſed ſome Clods, or as it were Turfs, to be cut out of that Soil, and laid in a kind of Heap, and that then in the Night he could ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Steams that plentifully iſſued thence would ſometimes be kindled by or in the Air, as they aſcended in it.</p>

The ſame Noble-Man told me, that when ſome Years ago there were Eruptions of Fire in <hi>Mount Veſuvius,</hi> he and others obſerv'd, with Amazement and Horror, that the Flame, which ſhot up into the Air from the <hi>Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano,</hi> was of ſo prodigious a Height, as invited them to meaſure it with a Quadrant, by which they found it to be near two Miles high: And when I ask'd if he compriſed in that Height the Altitude of the Mountain it ſelf? he anſwered, that he did not, for the Flame that appear'd above the top of the Mountain, appear'd as high as the Mountain it ſelf; and 'twas from the top of the Hill, and not the bottom, that they computed the Height of the Flame. He added, that ſometimes the Earth would tremble, and there would be Diſcharges of ſuch vaſt Stones, and other heavy things, that he ſaw ſome Maſſis of ignited Matter thrown up a great way into the Air, that were bigger than the Chamber he did me the Honour to viſit me in, though that were a large Room for a Bed-chamber.</p>

            <p>It has been often obſerv'd, that upon the Falling of Thunder there has been produc'd in the Air, near the Places where it fell, a ſtrong Odour of Burnt Brimſtone. And I remember, that being one Night at a Town built almoſt upon the great Lake of <hi>Geneva,</hi> anciently called <hi>Lacus Lemanus:</hi> The Thunder was ſo violent as much frighted the Inhabitants; though (by reaſon of the Neighbourhood of the high Mountains of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy</hi> and <hi>Switzerland)</hi> Thunders be very frequent there: And the next Day I had a great Complaint made me, of the ſtrong Stink of Sulphur, produc'd by the Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that fell hard by, into the Lake, and was ready to overcome by its Smell, even a Souldier that ſtood Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionel near it.</p>
            <p>On <hi>July 24. An.</hi> 1681. The Ship <hi>Albemarl,</hi> whereof Mr. <hi>Edward Lad</hi> was then Maſter, being an hundred Leagues from <hi>Cape Cod</hi> in Latitude 48. about 3 P. M. met with a Thunder Storm, the Lightning burnt the Main-top-ſail, ſplit the main Cap in pieces, rent the Maſt all along. There was in ſpecial one dreadful Clap of Thunder, in Report bigger than of a great Gun, at which all the Ships Company were amazed: then did there fall ſomething from the Clouds upon the Stern of the Boat, which it broke into many ſmall Parts, ſplit one of the Pumps, the other Pump much hurt: it was a Bituminous Matter, ſmelling much like fired
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:100378:39"/>
Gunpowder: it continued burning in the Stern of the Boat. They did with Sticks diſſipate it, and poured much Water on it, and yet they were not able, by all they could do, to extinguiſh it, until ſuch time as all the Matter was conſumed. But the ſtrangeſt thing of all is yet to be mentioned.</p>
            <p>When Night came, obſerving the Stars, they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that their Compaſſes were changed. As for the Compaſs in the Biddekel the North Point was turned clear South. There were two other Compaſſes unhung in the Locker in the Cabbin, in one of which the North Point ſtood South like that in the Biddekel. As for the other the North Point ſtood Weſt, ſo that they ſailed by Needle, whoſe Polarity was quite changed. The Sea-men were at firſt puzled to work their Veſſel right, conſidering that the South Point of their Compaſs was now become North: But after a little Uſe it was eaſy to them; thus did they ſail a thouſand Leagues. As for the Compaſs, wherein the Lightning had made the Needle to point Weſtward; ſince is was brought to <hi>New-England</hi> the Glaſs being broken, it has, by means of the Air coming to it, loſt its Vertue. One of their Compaſſes which had quite changed the Polarity, from North to South, is ſtill extant in that Country, in the Hands of Mr. <hi>Encreaſe Mather;</hi> the North Point of the Needle doth remain fixed to this Day as it did immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after the Lightning cauſed the Alteration.</p>
            <p>An induſtrious Gentleman that was long an eminent Planter of Trees, wherewith he furniſhed many of his Neighbours, preſented me with a Piece of a Branch that ſeemed to have had a Slit, for it reached thorow the Bark almoſt to the very Wood, from one End to the other, but had now the Lips of the Wound overgrown on each ſide with new Bark: Of this kind of Gaſhes,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:100378:39"/>
he told me, he found in other Branches of the ſame Tree, which made him think that ſome envious Knave had done this in Spite: but conſidering the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances more curiouſly, he found that Conjecture much diſcountenanced by ſome of them, and ſuſpected that theſe Wounds muſt have been made by ſome deſignleſs Agent. For by his own Obſervations, and thoſe of his Friends, it appeared, that theſe Fiſſures are to be met with, not only in divers others of his own Trees, of differing kinds, and in differing Plantations, but alſo in the Trees of ſeveral others, which tho growing in the ſame Country, were remote enough from his: ſo that it having been obſerved with ſome Wonder, that in the foregoing Seaſon, Lightnings had been very numerous and frequent, he and his Friends concluded, for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that need not be here repeated, that the above-mentioned Gaſhes were ſome of the odd Effects of thoſe Lightnings, which kept me from wondering at his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative Anſwer, to the Curioſity I had to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther all theſe Wounds of the Trees look'd the ſame way, as Eaſt or Weſt, North or South. For I had formerly obſerved, that the ſame Fulmen or Flaſh of Lightning reaching to the Earth in the Form of Fire, appeared by the recent Effects as well of its impetuous Motion as of its violent Heat, to have moved in an irregularly winding-Line: which made me compare its Motion to that of a Squib, and help'd me to ſolve ſome odd Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena of Lightning, that this is not the fitteſt Place to diſcourſe of: the foregoing Mention of what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the Trees, being deſigned, partly to preſerve the Memory of an unuſual Phenomenon, and partly to ſhow that whatever is wont to happen in Animals, Lightning is not always deſtructive or corruptive of
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:100378:40"/>
Vegetables, ſince the Wounds inflicted to Trees were happily cicatrized, and did not kill or poiſon the Plants. And whether this Phenomenon were produced, by ſome mineral Exhalations kindled in the Air, or by the violent and irregular Motion of ſome ſuch Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or by both together, the Phenomenon will be pertinent to the Subject or Deſign of the preſent Tract.</p>

            <p>I Shall not I hope altogether forget the Charge which you have been pleaſed to lay upon me, in reference to the Conſideration of all winy Liquors, their Affections, and the ſeveral Diſtempers incident to them, with my Thoughts about the preſerving of them, ſo as may beſt retard the Quickneſs of their Motion, and hinder their Dyſcraſy and Corruption.</p>
            <p>To which End an exact Scrutiny into the Air, its Quality, Temperament and Motion, and an Inquiry of the Efficacy and Force that this hath upon all ſuch Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, will be in ſome meaſure neceſſary.</p>
            <p>And this puts me in mind to leave one Requeſt with you, <hi>viz.</hi> to beg-your Aſſiſtance and Countenance on all Occaſions to Mr. <hi>Streete,</hi> when he ſhall at any time wait on you, who both as to his Undertaking, and to the Modeſty and Simplicity of his Spirit, doth very much emulate our ſo much joint-eſteemed Friend Mr. <hi>Mercator,</hi> who, though he may differ from the former, in reference to his Method, or to ſome of the profounder Parts of Learning: yet I think it very poſſible to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them in the main, and cannot but expect ſomething
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:100378:41"/>
extraordinary, in the aſſerting and perfecting of the Theory of the Planets, will be brought forth between them, which I ſhould the more gladly ſee, by how much moſt Scholars complain of it, as of a thing hitherto wanting, by how much alſo I gueſs, that having the Examples of ſo many who have already attempted the ſame thing in vain, they will find themſelves the more conſtrained to lay down ſome new choice, ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and undeniable Hypotheſis, for the better Invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Admittance of their Opinion among Learned Men, although ſuch a Work be no leſs neceſſary alſo for other Reaſons.</p>
            <p>For if we aſſert not the Theory of the Planets rightly, and upon ſuch Ground as are indubitably demonſtrable; we ſhall never be free from Errors and Diſagreements in Opinion about their Motions, and the right Calculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of them.</p>
            <p>And if we miſtake in either of theſe, we muſt miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the true Place in the Heavens, in which each Planet is, or conſtantly ought to be: And if we at all err in our Judgment of their due Places, it is impoſſible we ſhould aſſert their ſeveral Aſpects, and the mutual Influences and Virtues they have (through this) one upon another: And ſo the Phyſical Uſe of their Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons falls to the Ground wholly, or at leaſt becomes ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to very much Uncertainty.</p>
            <p>And truly, if there be no ſuch Uſe at all of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe Bodies, as that which I may call Phyſical, <hi>viz</hi> for predicting, and for (in ſome meaſure) deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the Affections, Diſpoſitions and Alterations, that are introduced into ſeveral things here, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately, or into the Air immediately, by reaſon of the Courſe of theſe ſuperior Bodies, it would very much leſſen and depretiate with me, that Toil, Coſt,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:100378:41"/>
Pains, Watchings, and continual Exerciſes, and Indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, that have been uſed for the gaining of exact Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations in Aſtronomy. Seeing when we have done all, and obtained all beyond the mere bare Knowledg of them, we can propound no End, Benefit, Uſe or Advantage, that may recompenſe the Trouble and Pains beſtowed upon them, (at leaſt upon ſome of them) nor ſo much as any real or particular Relation, between us and them; and if ſo, we know them only to know them.</p>
            <p>But we ſhall at preſent preſume the contrary, and therefore ſhall crave leave to ſay, that although ſeveral Objections are commonly brought againſt any ſuch Uſe or Application of theſe Bodies, or of their Power, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence or Motions, which are occaſioned partly by the Superſtition and Paganiſm incident to this kind of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; partly by the Impoſture, Ignorance, and want of Learning, generally obſerved in the Perſons pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing this Knowledg; partly by the manifeſt Miſtakes and Uncertainty that there is in the Predictions of this Nature; and partly by the Inexplicableneſs of the Way or Manner how they come to affect one another, which admits not, as many conceive, of an eaſy viſible or fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Demonſtration. Yet all theſe Objections, if through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly examined, do not, as we humbly conceive, really null or take away the Poſſibility of the thing ſimply, but are raiſed rather againſt the Enormities and Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections that are confeſſed to be in it: and it may, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all thoſe Objections, ſtill be certain, that theſe Celeſtial Bodies (according to the Angles they make one upon another, but eſpecially with the Sun or with the Earth in our Meridian, or with ſuch and ſuch other Points in the Heavens) may have a Power to cauſe ſuch and ſuch Motions, Changes and Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:100378:42"/>
(ſtronger or weaker, according to the Nature of the Angle) as the Extremities of which ſhall at length be felt in every one of us: And this may be evidenced, <hi>1ſt.</hi> by undeniable Experiments, not only from things inanimate and vegitate, but from the undoubted Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of Phyſicians, as well in ſeveral Chronical as acute Diſtempers, and more eminently in all Lunatick, Epileptick, Paralitick or Lethargick Perſons. <hi>2dly.</hi> It may further admit of a Demonſtration: for if the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Motions of Phyſick be Generation and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the mean Motions Rarefaction and Conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, allowing then theſe Bodies to have a ſhare in promoting the mean Motions, <hi>(viz)</hi> of Rarefaction and Condenſation, we ſhall or may ſoon be convinced, that their Effects then upon all other things here, cannot but be exceeding conſiderable.</p>
            <p>For the better underſtanding of which, I ſhall offer, a little more largely to you my Conceptions, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That to ſpeak properly and ſimply, I take Generation and Corruption to be the Extreams of Motion, rather than Motions themſelves: for the Scope, Intentions or Effects of all Phyſical Motions (ſtrictly ſo taken) are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to one of theſe Ends, <hi>viz.</hi> either for Generation or Corruption: and theſe two are they alſo which limit and bound all Motion; for beyond theſe Meets there is no Phyſical Progreſſion, and therefore theſe two muſt be the true <hi>Termini,</hi> as well <hi>à quo,</hi> as <hi>ad quem,</hi> of all ſuch Motion, ſeeing all things are corrupted to be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated, and all things generated are at length cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted.</p>
            <p>But if theſe be rather the <hi>Termini</hi> and Extreams of Motion, then Motion it ſelf. We muſt acknowledg, there are Motions, which Nature uſeth as Means, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Extreams; which mean Motion muſt
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:100378:42"/>
be as oppoſite alſo one to another, as the two Extreams. Otherwiſe we ſhould never be at a Certainty, which way Nature intends by her Motion: otherwiſe alſo we muſt ſay one and the ſame Courſe, or one and the ſame thing in Nature, may ſimply and of it ſelf, be the immediate Cauſe of Generation and Corruption, of Life and of Death, of Hardneſs and Softneſs, which is abſurd and impoſſible.</p>
            <p>Now as theſe two Motions of Rarefaction and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſation, are oppoſite one to the other, as is required, ſo do they ſquare to all other the Inſtruments and Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena in Nature, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the one anſwering to Heat, the other to cold; the one to Hardneſs, Compactneſs and Aridity, the other to Gentleneſs, Softneſs, Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Maturity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For which Reaſons therefore, as well as for many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which might be urged, (if inſiſted on) we do conclude, (ſubmitting it nevertheleſs to be examined) that Generation and Corruption, Rarefaction and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſation, is the ſimpleſt, plaineſt and trueſt Analyſis, that can be found in Nature, for all Phyſical Motions, as unto ſome of which all Motion, purely Phyſical, may (as we humbly conceive) without ſtraining, be immediately referred, and as by and through which all may likewiſe, with as little Difficulty, be reſolved.</p>
            <p>And having laid this as a ſecond Argument; we ſay <hi>3dly.</hi> That it cannot be denied, but all the Affections and Diſpoſitions of Moiſture, Heat, Cold, Drought, the Courſe of all Winds, Showers, Thundering, or whatſoever elſe is uſed by Nature, to produce theſe two general and univerſal Effects of Rarefaction and Condenſation, do in a great Meaſure, if not wholly, depend upon, and are altogether regulated by the Courſe, Motion, Poſition, Situations or Aſpects of the Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:100378:43"/>
and Celeſtial Bodies or Planets. And therefore, <hi>4thly.</hi> We ſay, that every Planet hath its own proper Light: And as the Light of the Sun is one thing, the Light of the Moon another; ſo every Planet hath its diſtinct Light, differing from all the other. Now we muſt either ſay, that this Light is a bare Quality, and that the utmoſt Uſe and End of it is only to illuminate; and there is no Light but is accompanied further with ſome Power, Virtue or Tincture, that is proper to it: which if granted, it will inform us then, that every Light hath its own Property, its own Tincture and Colour, its own ſpecifique Virtue and Power; and that according to the ſeveral Bodies of Light, there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Properties, Tinctures and Powers; and that as one Star differs from another in Glory (according to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle) ſo one Star and one Planet differs from another in its Virtue, in its Colour, in its Tincture, and in its Property.</p>
            <p>And conſequently, that thoſe eminent Stars and Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets that are in the Heavens, are not to be conſidered by us as ſluggiſh inergetical Bodies, or as if they were ſet only to be as bare Candles to us, but as Bodies full of proper Motion, of peculiar Operation, and of Life. The Sun not only ſhining upon the reſt of the Planets; but by his quickning Warmth, awakening, ſtirring and raiſing the Motions, Properties and Powers, that are peculiar to them. According therefore to the Angles, they make with the Sun, and according as they are more or leſs enlightned by him; according alſo as they are at the ſame time more directly or more obliquely, more remotely or more nearly ſcituated and placed, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to us; ſo muſt the Effects of the Powers, Virtues and Tinctures, that are proper to them, be more or leſs felt by us. <hi>5thly.</hi> For the manner of the Planets,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:100378:43"/>
tranſmitting theſe their Properties and Powers, and of their affecting other Bodies at ſo remote Diſtance, there is nothing begged or required in it, that is inſuperable to a Man's Apprehenſion or Belief: (ſeeing,)</p>
            <p n="1">1. We affirm not any Property, Operation, Virtue, or Power, to be tranſmitted from any of the ſaid Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets, but what doth deſcend with its Light, and is the real Property of its Light.</p>
            <p n="2">2. No Man judgeth, that the Light of any Planet, or of the Sun it ſelf, is refracted, or by any other means weakned, hindred or impaired by the Aether (or that Subſtance which fills up the Space between one Planet and another) through which it paſſeth; but that it doth deſcend whole directly and inrefracted unto, or upon our Atmoſphere.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But whatſoever is received by the Atmoſphere, is alſo received by the thin and ſubtile Air, that is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to the Atmoſphere: And this Air therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be capable of being moved, ſtirred, altered, and impreſſed by theſe Properties, Virtues and Lights, as penetrating each Part of it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Not only the Air, by reaſon of its Thinneſs and Subtilty, is capable of being thus penetrated, moved and altered, by theſe Planetary, Virtues and Lights: But foraſmuch alſo as our Spirits, and the Spirits like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of all mix'd Bodies, are really of an Aerious, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereal, Luminous Production and Compoſition; theſe Spirits therefore of ours, and the Spirits of all other Bodies, muſt neceſſarily no leſs ſuffer an Impreſſion from the ſame Lights, and cannot be leſs ſubject to an Alteration, Motion, Agitation and Infection, through them and by them, than the other <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Air: But rather as our Spirits are more near and more Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous to the Nature of Light than the Air, ſo they
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:100378:44"/>
muſt be more prone and eaſy to be impreſſed than it. And if our Spirits, and the Spirits of all mix'd Bodies may be altered, changed, moved and impreſſed by theſe ſuperiour Bodies, and their Properties; then theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits being the only Principles of Energy, Power, Force and Life, in all Bodies wherein they are, and the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Cauſes, through which all Alteration comes to the Bodies themſelves. It is impoſſible therefore Spirits ſhould be altered and changed, and yet no Alteration made in the Bodies themſelves: and therefore a leſs Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit or Extream cannot be ſet to the Power or Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or Force of the ſuperiour Bodies upon the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, than what muſt terminate at length into the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bodies themſelves.</p>
            <p n="5">5. As a further Confirmation or Proof of this, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence at leaſt to our ſelves, I ſhall offer to your Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration the Accidents that often happen to Men, by the mere Air, as Convulſions, Cramps, Blaſtings, Lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Colds, many of which indure a Man's Life-time; and which (with many bitter Infirmities that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſeize upon a Man, while ſtanding, walking, or lying in the Air) are rarely or never felt or diſcerned at the Inſtant of their Approach or Inſults upon a Man, nor yet accompanied with the Senſe of any Exceſs in the Air for Heat or Cold at that time, and therefore not well referrable to any Cauſe in the Air, if not to the Power of thoſe Properties and Operations of the Celeſtial Bodies that we ſpeak of: And this I ſubmit to the Judgment of common Experience.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Laſtly; As the Sun-ſhining on the reſt of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets doth not, as we ſaid, only barely illuminate their Bodies; but beſides this, through the Power, Virtue and Activity it hath, doth alſo raiſe, excite, awaken and ſtir up the ſeveral Properties and Diſpoſitions that
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:100378:44"/>
are in thoſe ſeveral and reſpective Bodies, whereby they are more lively and effectually brought forth upon us; ſo we are to ſuppoſe it is in reference to this our Planet, which is the Earth, which is not only enlightned, warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, cheriſhed and fructified by the Power, Virtue and Influence of the Sun; but hath its proper Magnetical, Planetary Virtue, alſo fermented, ſtirred, agitated and awakened in it, which it remits back with the reflected Light of the Sun: and together with this Magnetick Planetary Property of the Earth, which is ſtirred and raiſed by the Sun, are awakened alſo the ſeminal Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, Odors and Ferments that are lodged in, and proper unto particular Regions or Places, which do likewiſe emit and diffuſe through the Air, as their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and reſpective benign, grateful, ſo their ſeveral ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant, congelative and fracedonous Natures and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
            <p>And hence therefore, though the Air, its Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Diſpoſition and Quality in general, is to be look'd at, according to the Motions, Influences and Aſpects of the ſeveral ſuperiour Bodies; yet the particular Healthfulneſs and Unhealthfulneſs of Places, the evil Diſpoſition of the Air, Evenings, Nights, and early in the Mornings, in ſome Parts more than in others; the ſuper-abundant Moiſture, exceſſive Winds, Droughts or other Seaſons, proper to one Country, and not to be obſerved in another neighbouring to it; all theſe are rather to be allowed and referred to thoſe O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, Vapors and Exhalations, that are through the Power of the Sun, or other Planets, drawn forth from their particular Seats into the Air, from the Planets themſelves.</p>
            <p>And thus I have hinted, as well as I may, at the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of all the Phenomena pertaining to this matter, that I can think of.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:100378:45"/>
And if this be ſo, then wholly to neglect this Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Uſe (and Conſideration) of the Motion of theſe Bodies, and either to reject it, becauſe of the Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that hath been mix'd with it, or to exclude it from all manner of Care, and from all other further Scruti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, as a thing not worth our Inquiry or Search at all after, is as great an Extream on the other hand, and a Miſtake, that muſt not paſs untaxed among Learned Men.</p>
            <p>You did not expect, I am ſure, I ſhould have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured into ſo particular an Apology for Aſtrology; nor did I intend it, when I begun my Letter; nor do I now aim to juſtify any thing further, than what may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, if not neceſſarily, fall into the Conſideration of Natural Philoſophy, being indeed much induced to think, that were the Theory of the Planets ſo exactly ſtated, ſo perfectly, or ſo undeniably demonſtrated, that we might be ſure we rightly underſtood the Place, Courſe and Poſition of each of their Bodies in the Heavens; this other Doctrine of their Phyſical Uſe, with the Weight, Dignity, Extent, Conſiderableneſs or Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderableneſs of it, would ſoon confirm and demonſtrate it ſelf by the Evidence and Proof of it ſelf, eſpecially if any will pleaſe to take the Pains to calculate theſe Motions for his own private Uſe, and according to the Meridian he is in, and ſo compare them with his own Obſervations, of the Change and Alteration of the Air from Day to Day. Which doubtleſs, as it was the way at firſt taken by the Ancients, to find out their Efficacy, (I mean the making ſuch a conſtant Obſervation, and keeping ſuch a Diary) ſo the doing of that again, and giving us firſt an Hiſtory or Diary of the Obſervations of the Weather, and its Changes in all Reſpects, and then an Account of the ſeveral Places, Motions, or
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:100378:45"/>
Aſpects, each Day, of the ſeveral Bodies of the Heavens, with the Agreements, Doubts, or Diſagreements, that theſe bear one to another, and that muſt neceſſarily riſe thereupon, would be that, that could not but prove both ſatisfactory and delightſom to us, in this great Point, about their Phyſical Power and Uſe.</p>
            <p>And the Commodity of this in our Oeconomical or Civil Concerns in Husbandry, in Gardening, in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and to the producing many other very ſtupendous Effects, cannot poſſibly be ſo well credited or diſcerned as it would, if ſome ſuch plain Foundation and Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Power of theſe Bodies, in general, were laid. Which methinks we ſhould be much the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged to undertake, having an Advantage given us in this Age, beyond what moſt Ages ever had, by the Uſe of thoſe rare Inſtruments, that they call the Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometers, or Weather-Glaſſes.</p>
            <p>And truly when I conſider, that things of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Conſequence do oft-times depend upon the moſt common Obſervations; and that Matters of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Improvement do receive their Beginning from mean, ſmall, ordinary Experiments: I would have no Man, who hath Leiſure, Opportunity and Time, to think it a ſlight thing to buſy himſelf in collecting Obſervations of this Nature. It being much more commendable for a Man to preſerve the Hiſtory of his own Time, though but in the Obſervation of the Motions of this kind, than to ſay, upon every Occaſion that offers it ſelf, this is the hotteſt, or this is the coldeſt; or this is the rainieſt, or this is the moſt ſeaſonable or unſeaſonable Weather that ever he felt; whereas it may perhaps be nothing ſo.</p>
            <p>And if there were no other Uſe, yet Obſervations of this Nature would much conduce to compleat the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:100378:46"/>
Hiſtory of any Place, as we may obſerve by that Learned Author who writ <hi>Hiſtoriam Naturalem Braſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liae;</hi> and who, to prove not only the Habitableneſs, but Healthfulneſs of that Climate and Country, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bites the Account of every Day's Weather, obſerved by him for many Years together, and ſo the Agreement of it to that Temper, which we account healthful.</p>
            <p>But the inſtituting and perfecting of accurate Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of this Nature, by the help of ſeveral large and exact Thermometers, placed in ſeveral Rooms, or expoſed after ſome convenient Manner to the Air it ſelf, would be a more noble and uſeful Undertaking, than ordinary. I ſay, the doing this accurately, by large and exact Glaſſes, by placing ſeveral of them, either toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or at ſome fit Diſtance one from another. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much to be lamented, and that which I cannot but complain to my ſelf of, that no Improvement conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable hath, as I can learn, been made by any Man, of theſe Glaſſes, either in our own Country, or any where elſe, ſince their firſt Invention, (but only to hang them in a Room for Ornament ſake) there being many things yet wanting, that were much to be deſired for the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting of them. For;</p>
            <p n="1">1. None hath hitherto given us the beſt Proportions between the Diameter of the Head, and the Diameter of the Bodies or Cylinder, although this be indeed the very firſt Conſideration, and that which is moſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the Uſe of theſe Inſtruments; for as by how much the bigger the Cylinder is, and by how much the leſſer the Head, by ſo much the more ſlow and imperceptible the Air's Alteration and Motion will be; ſo by how much the bigger the Head, and ſmaller the Cylinder is, by ſo much the more quick, ſubtile and diſcernable will every ſmall Difference of the Air appear, which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:100378:46"/>
being on both ſides capable of an Extream, ought to be regulated neceſſarily, according to ſome mean.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Admitting a mean or convenient Proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two Diameters, to be as one to 16, or one to 24. We in the next Place do no leſs want the fitteſt Proportion for the Length of the Cylinder, which muſt doubtleſs alſo be varied anſwerably, as we vary the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of its Diameter, the ſmaller Cylinder in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to its Head, requiring the greater Length, the bigger Cylinder on the contrary the ſhorter Length.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I have not hitherto ſeen any Cylinder that hath been well graduated, 12 or 16 Degrees being the moſt that are ſet upon the common Weather-Glaſs: whereas to the making of accurate Obſervations, it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a Cylinder to be divided into at leaſt 360 Parts; though I think it neither unreaſonable nor unpracticable, to have one divided into 1000 Parts, allowing but 10 Degrees to each Inch, which is no unuſual Diviſion, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch an one will much better diſcover, not only the ſmall, but the more ſuddain and remarkable Changes of the Weather, (which are of chiefeſt Uſe) than any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that are common and ordinary.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Although no Liquor ought to be uſed in theſe Glaſſes, that is ſubject to Froſt; yet we have little or no Account what thoſe Liquors are, that might be beſt or fitteſt for the accurate making of thoſe Experiments; whether thoſe whoſe Property it is, ſomewhat to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract the Air, and ſo to preſerve themſelves in at leaſt their firſt Quantity, as <hi>Oleum Sulphuris per Campanam, Ol. Vitrioli, Liquor Salis Tartari, &amp;c.</hi> Or, <hi>2dly.</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thoſe whoſe Parts are fineſt, ſubtileſt, and neareſt of kin to the Air, ſuch as is Spirit of Wine, Spirit of <hi>Tere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binth,</hi> well rectified, and according as there is occaſion ſtill freſh ſupplied. Or, <hi>3dly.</hi> Whether thoſe that are
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:100378:47"/>
of a middle Nature, as ſtrong Spirit of Vinegar. Or, <hi>4thly.</hi> Whether inſtead of theſe, and beyond theſe, it may not be beſt to uſe only well-refined Quickſilver.</p>
            <p>All which ſeveral Particulars, as they are neceſſary, and ought to be firſt aſcertained, yet they are but preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary to the Experiments themſelves.</p>
            <p>In the making of the Experiments themſelves, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would be convenient; <hi>1ſt.</hi> That ſeveral Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometers of one Proportion, Length and Graduation in their Cylinders in all Reſpects, as near as may be, were ſet in one Frame together, either with one and the ſame, or with Variety of Liquors. <hi>2dly.</hi> That ſeveral of theſe Frames were ſet in ſeveral Rooms, and that fome were expoſed immediately to the Air it ſelf; yet ſo as it may be conveniently ſheltred from the actual Rays of the Sun, and from the Injury of Storms, Rain and Winds.</p>
            <p>In the Hiſtory it ſelf, there cannot be too much Care and Exactneſs provided; the Air of the Chimny, Cran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of a Wall or Door, Breath of People, or other ſuch Accidents, do not interpoſe to deceive a Man's Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which muſt be circumſpectly foreſeen and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>
            <p>The Proportion between the Warmth of the Day and Night, in conſtant Weather; the Agreement or Diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement of the Motion of the Air; with the Motions of the ſuperiour Bodies, in all uncertain, changeable and inconſtant Weather; the Efficacy or Inefficacy through theſe, in foretelling of Winds and Rain; the Air its particular Diſpoſition, under Thunder, under times of Mildews or Blaſtings, eminent Eclipſes, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions; with many other the like Particulars, which will of themſelves be incident to an ingenious, diligent, apprehenſive Perſon, may be the Subject of this Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="81" facs="tcp:100378:47"/>
I ſhall not digreſs ſo far, as to tell you, what other things may be done by the Help of this excellent Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, this being not pertinent to our preſent Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Yet it is certain, that <hi>Drebble,</hi> that great, ſingular, learned Mechanick, did by the Help of this Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, make a Dial continually to move of it ſelf; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly ſhewing both the times of the Day, and other Motions of the Heavens; did alſo make an Automatous Inſtrument of Muſick; and found out a Furnace which he could govern to any Degree of Heat: but whether theſe have died with him, or how far the Meditations of others have wrought upon them, I ſhall humbly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to a more leaſurable Inquiry. And if you can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me among any of your Acquaintance or Corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondents, I ſhould be glad to hear and to learn any thing of this Nature, or relating to the further Uſe, Experiment or Improvement of this rare little Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or to the further clearing, ventilating or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſing the Theory or Doctrine of the Planets, or the Phyſical Uſe and Power of theſe Bodies that we have thus briefly made an Eſſay of. Thus far that Letter.</p>
            <p>They have a received Tradition in <hi>Java,</hi> and proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in divers other Iſlands of the South Sea, that the Beams of the Moon are wont to cauſe Contractures in the Body of thoſe Men that ſtay too long expoſed to them: The Truth of which Tradition was lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to me by an ingenious Doctor, that with Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe practiſed Phyſick in thoſe Parts; who aſſured me, that he had obſerved, that upon the Account before mentioned ſome were made lame, or elſe had ſome of their Limbs contracted for divers Weeks, and ſome for many Months, or even a longer time. And when I asked him, whether he had at any time been
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:100378:48"/>
ſubject to that Miſchief himſelf? He anſwered, that whilſt he was a Novice in thoſe Parts, after a very hot Day, he laid himſelf down very ſlenderly covered, to ſleep (according to the Cuſtom of the Place) near the Door of the Houſe he lodg'd in; but being unacquainted with the Tradition, he unskilfully choſe a Place upon which the Moon could fully beat for a good part of the Night, which being paſt before he wak'd, when he went to riſe, he found his Neck ſo ſtiff, that he was ſcarce able at all to ſtir it; and his Mouth was ſo drawn awry, that 'twas hideous to behold, and continued ſo unſightly, that Shame forced him to keep within for ſome Days; during which he made Uſe of brisk Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Medicines, by whoſe Help he got off a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracture that uſed to ſtay very much longer with others. And when I asked him, if theſe Diſtempers were not occaſioned rather by the Coldneſs of the Night and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the Air, than the Operation of the Moon's Beams? He anſwered me, that 'twas generally obſerv'd, that the other Cauſes, without the direct Beams of the Moon, were not wont to produce ſuch bad Effects; and that his Landlord, when he ſaw his Mouth awry, told him, that if he had made him acquainted with his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to paſs the Night in the open Air, he would have prevented this Miſchief, by lodging him in a Place un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expoſed to the Moon's Light.</p>

               <p>ALthough the Bar of <hi>Porta Nova</hi> proved more ſhallow and dangerous than we were informed; yet ſhe (our Ship) got ſafe in thither: and it was well ſhe did ſo. Had we kept her here, there had been no Poſſibility of her Eſcape from periſhing in a dreadful Storm, or rather Hurricane, which happened here the <hi>22d</hi> of <hi>November:</hi> The like hath not been known here in any Man's Memory. The Tempeſt of Wind and Rain was ſo exceeding violent, that nothing could ſtand before it; Men and Beaſts carried into the Sea by the Violence of the Winds and Floods: the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the Houſes in this and the Neighbour Towns were ruined: ſcarce any Trees left ſtanding in Gardens or elſewhere: the Wall of this Town laid flat in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Places; your <hi>Godownes</hi> and other Houſes in and about the Fort, uncovered and exceedingly ſhattered: no Place in the Fort where we could keep our Perſons, Books or Papers free from the Wind or Rain: nor ſcarcely any Doors could ſtand againſt the Violence of it: and we hourly feared the falling of the Fort down upon us, it was ſo exceedingly rock'd: and yet abroad we
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:100378:49"/>
could have no Shelter, nor were able to ſtand againſt it. The repairing of the Damage will neceſſarily require a great Charge, which at firſt we thought would have amounted to 3000 Pagothes: but hope it will come ſhort thereof.</p>
               <p>Captain <hi>Brookehaven</hi> told me, that about the Iſland <hi>Mauricius,</hi> Hurricanes were the moſt frequent of any Place he knows; and that near that Iſland he met with one which laſted four Days in all: in one of which Days the Storm had ſeven Paroxyſms or Exacerbations, which the Seamen call Frights of Weather, each of which he obſerved to differ two Points of the Compaſs from the preceding; by which Means the Surface of the Sea, by the Colliſion of the Waves, became to be all white, as if the Ship had been among Rocks. He added, that the Storm made the Day exceeding dark: And that the Noiſe was rather like that of Thunder, than of Wind, inſomuch that thoſe on the Shrouds could not hear thoſe on the Deck.</p>
               <p>A Learned Phyſician that travelled into <hi>America,</hi> affirmed to me, that thoſe Countries only have conſtant Winds from the Land in the Night, which are fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with Hills; and therefore the <hi>Barbadoes</hi> wants ſuch Winds, becauſe it has no Hills.</p>
               <p>One of the <hi>Eaſt-Indian</hi> Committee (who had lived Years in the Iſland of <hi>Teneriff)</hi> anſwered me, that he uſually obſerved there the Briezes to come in from the Sea about nine of the Clock in the Morning, and that about two Hours after Sun ſet, there blew a ſharp Land Wind, every way from the Iſland to the Sea-ward, which continued all Night till the next Morning.</p>
               <p>A Learned Traveller anſwered me, that though the Air were generally calm and clear at the Top of the Mountains, yet ſometimes he had met there with Winds conſiderably ſtrong.</p>

               <p>An ingenious Gentleman who is Owner of a Mine or two near the Sea, being asked by me, whether he could, by any peculiar Change appearing in the deeper Parts of the Mines, foretel any Alterations of Weather? He anſwered me, that the only Preſage he had conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſerved, was of the Change of the Wind. For ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hours before the Wind was to ſhift from ſome other Corner, and get into the South, the Water at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Mine would appear manifeſtly more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, or leſs limped than before: and when the Wind was to blow from the Eaſt, he was uſually forewarned of it by an unuſual Degree of Clearneſs in the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, which would appear more diaphanous than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, though the South-Wind had not immediately before operated on the Waters.

               <head>A ſhort Account of the Statical Baroſcope, imparted by Mr. <hi>Boyl,</hi> March 24. 1665. In a Letter to Mr. <hi>H. Oldenburgh.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS for the new kind of Baroſcopes, which I lately intimated to you, that my Haſte would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to give you an Account of, though the Neceſſity of preparing for an approaching Journey, gives me the ſame Excuſe, I then had; yet ſince your Letters acquaint me, that you ſtill deſign a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating to the Curious, as much Information as may be, in reference to Baroſcopes, I ſhall venture to ſend you ſome (though but an imperfect) Account of what I did but name in my former Letter to you.</p>
               <p>Though by a Paſſage you may meet with in the Page of my <hi>Thermometrical Experiments;</hi> and though you may find, that I did ſome Years ago think upon this new kind of Baroſcope; yet the Changes of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere's Weight not happening then to be ſuch as I wiſhed, and being unwilling to deprive my ſelf of all other Uſe of the exacteſt Ballance that I (or perhaps any Man) ever had: I confeſs to you, that ſucceſſive Avocations put this Attempt for two or three Years out of my Thoughts, till afterwards returning to a Place, where I chanc'd to find two or three Pairs of Scales, I
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:100378:52"/>
had left there, the Sight of them brought it again into my Mind; and though I were then unable to procure exacter, yet my Deſire to make the Experiment ſome Amends for ſo long a Neglect, put me upon conſidering, that if I provided a Glaſs Bubble more than ordinarily large and light, even ſuch Ballances as thoſe might, in ſome meaſure, perform, that which I had tried with the ſtrangely nice ones above-mentioned.</p>
               <p>I cauſed then to be blown at the Flame of a Lamp ſome Glaſs Bubbles as large, thin, and light, as I could then procure: and chuſing among them one, that ſeem'd the leaſt unfit for my turn, I counterpoized it in a pair of Scales, that would loſe their <hi>Equilibrium</hi> with about the <hi>30th</hi> part of a Grain, and were ſuſpended at a Frame. I placed both the Ballance and the Frame by a good Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſcope, from whence I might learn the preſent Weight of the Atmoſphere: then leaving theſe Inſtruments to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, though the Scales being no nicer, than I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, were not able to ſhew me all the Variations of the Air's Weight, that appear in the Mercurial Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope; yet they did what I expected, by ſhewing me Variations no greater than alter'd the Height of the Mercury half a quarter of an Inch, and perhaps much ſmaller than thoſe: nor did I doubt, that if I had had either tender Scales, or the means of ſupplying the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment with convenient Accommodations, I ſhould have diſcerned far ſmaller Alterations of the Weight of the Air, ſince I had the Pleaſure to ſee the Bubble ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in an <hi>Equilibrium,</hi> with the Counterpoize, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times when the Atmoſphere was lighter, preponderate ſo manifeſtly, that the Scales being gently ſtirred, the Tongue would play altogether on that ſide, at which the Bubble was hung: and at other times, when the Air was heavy (that which was at the firſt but the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſe)
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:100378:53"/>
would preponderate, and upon the Motion of the Ballance, make the Tongue vibrate altogether on its ſide: and this would continue ſometimes many Days together, if the Air ſo long retained the ſame meaſure of Gravity; and then again the Bubble would regain an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilibrium,</hi> or a Preponderance. So that I had oftentimes the Satisfaction by looking firſt upon the Statical Baro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope (as for Diſtinction ſake it may be called) to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, whether in the Mercurial Baroſcope the Liquor were high or low. Which Obſervations, though they hold as well in Winter as the Spring, yet the Frequency of their Viciſſitudes (which perhaps was but acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal) made them more pleaſant in the latter of theſe Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>So that the Matter of Fact having been made out by Variety of repeated Obſervations, and by ſometimes comparing ſeveral of thoſe new Baroſcopes together, I ſhall add ſome of thoſe Notes, about this Inſtrument, which readily occur to my Memory, reſerving the reſt till another Opportunity.</p>
               <p>And, 1. If the Ground on which I went in fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming this Baroſcope, be demanded, the Anſwer in ſhort may be; <hi>1ſt.</hi> That though the glaſs Bubble, and its Counterpoiſe, at the time of their firſt being weighed, be in the Air, wherein they both are weighed, exactly of the ſame Weight; yet they are nothing near of the ſame Bulk, the Bubble by reaſon of its capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cavity (which contains nothing but Air, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that weighs leſs than Air) being perhaps a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, or two hundred times bigger, than the Metalline Counterpoiſe. <hi>2dly.</hi> That according to an Hydroſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Law, (which you know I have lately had occaſion to make out) if two Bodies of equal Gravity, but unequal Bulk, were to be weighed in another Medium, they
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:100378:53"/>
will be no longer equiponderant: but if the new Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium be heavier, the greater Body, as being lighter <hi>in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie,</hi> will loſe more of its Weight than the leſſer and more compact: but if the new Medium be lighter than the firſt, then the bigger Body will outweigh the leſſer. And this Diſparity ariſing from the Change of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums, will be ſo much the greater, by how much the greater Inequality of Bulk there is between the Bodies formerly equiponderant. <hi>3dly.</hi> That laying theſe two together, I conſider'd, that 'twould be all one, as to the Effect to be produced, wherein the Bodies were weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Mediums of differing Gravity, or in the ſame Medium, in caſe its (ſpecifick) Gravity were conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly altered; And conſequently, that ſince it appeared by the Baroſcope, that the Weight of the Air was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times heavier, and ſometimes lighter, the Alteration of it in Point of Gravity, from the Weight it was of, at firſt counterpoiſing of the Bubble in it, would unequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affect ſo large and hollow a Body as the Bubble, and ſo ſmall and denſe an one, as a Metalline Weight; and when the Air, by an Encreaſe of Gravity, ſhould become a heavier Medium than before, it would buoy up the Glaſs more than the Counterpoize, and if it grew lighter than it was at firſt, would ſuffer the former to proponderate. (The Illuſtration and Proof can ſcarce be added in few Words, but if it be deſired, I may, God permitting, ſend you them at my next leiſure.) And though our Engliſh Air, being about a thouſand times lighter than Water, the Difference in Weight of ſo little Air, as is but equal in Bulk to a Bubble, ſeem'd to give ſmall Hopes, that it would be ſenſible upon a Ballance; yet by making the Bubble very large and light, I ſuppoſed, and found the Event, I have already related.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:100378:54"/>
2. The hermetically ſeal'd glaſs Bubble, I imployed, was of the Bigneſs of a ſomewhat large Orange, and weighed about one Drachm and ten Grains. I thought it very poſſible, if I had been better furniſhed with Conveniences (wherein I afterwards found, I was not miſtaken) to make (among many that might be expected to miſcarry) ſome, that might be preferra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to this, either for Capacity or Lightneſs, or both, eſpecially if Care be taken, that they be not ſeal'd up whilſt they are too hot. For though one would think, that it were advantageous to ratify and drive out the Air, as much as is poſſible, becauſe in ſuch ſeal'd Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the Air it ſelf (as I have elſewhere ſhewn) has a Weight, yet the Advantage countervails not the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience of being obliged to increaſe the Weight of the Glaſs, which when it includes highly ratified Air, if it be not ſomewhat ſtrong, will be broken by the Preſſure of the external Air, as I have ſufficiently tried.</p>
               <p>3. By reaſon of the Difficulties, and Caſualties, that may happen, about the procuring and preparing ſuch large and light Bubbles, as I have been lately mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it may in ſome Caſes prove a Convenience to be informed, that I have ſometimes, inſtead of one ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently large Bubble, made Uſe of two that were ſmaller: And though a ſingle Bubble of competent Bigneſs be much preferrable, by reaſon, that a far leſs Quantity and Weight of Glaſs is requiſite to comprize an equal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, when the Glaſs is blown into a ſingle Bubble, than when it is divided into two; yet I found, that the employing of two inſtead of one, did not ſo ill anſwer my Expectation, but that they may for a need ſerve the turn, inſtead of the other, than which they are much eaſier to be procured.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="tcp:100378:54"/>
This Inſtrument may be much improved by divers Accommodations. As, <hi>1ſt.</hi> there may be fitted to the <hi>Anſa</hi> (or Checks of the Ballance) an Arch of a Circle, divided into 15 or 20 Degrees, (more or leſs according to the Goodneſs of the Ballance) that the Tongue reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over againſt any of theſe Diviſions, may readily, and without Calculation, ſhew the Quantity of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, by which when the Scales propend either way, the Tongue declines from the Perpendicular, and the Beam from its Horizontal Paralleliſm. <hi>2dly.</hi> Thoſe that will be ſo curious, may inſtead of the ordinary Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe (of Braſs) imploy one of Gold, or at leaſt of Lead, whereof the latter being of equal Weight with Braſs, is much leſs in Bulk, and the former amounts not to half its Bigneſs. <hi>3dly.</hi> Theſe Parts of the Ballance that may be made of Copper or Braſs, without any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Exactneſs, will by being made of one of thoſe Metals, be leſs ſubject than Steel to ruſt with long ſtanding. <hi>4thly.</hi> Inſtead of the Scales, the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble may be hung at one End of the Beam, and only a Counterpoiſe to it at the other, that the Beam may not be burden'd with unneceſſary Weight. <hi>5thly.</hi> The whole Inſtrument, if placed in a ſmall Frame, like a ſquare Lanthorn with Glaſs Windows, and a Hole at the top for the Commerce of the internal and external Air, will be more free from Duſt and irregular Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to the latter of which it will otherwiſe be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times liable. <hi>6thly.</hi> This Inſtrument being accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated with a light Wheel, and an Index, may be made to ſhow much more minute Variations than otherwiſe. <hi>7thly.</hi> The Length of the Beam, and Exquiſitneſs of the Ballance, may eaſily, without any of the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Helps (and much more with them) make the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument far exacter than thoſe, I was reduced to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy.
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:100378:55"/>
And to theſe Accommodations, divers other may be ſuggeſted by a further Conſideration of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the thing.</p>
               <p>Though in ſome Reſpects the Statical Baroſcope be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to the Mercurial, yet in others it has its own Advantages and Conveniency about it.</p>
               <p>At <hi>first</hi> it confirms <hi>ad oculum,</hi> our former Doctrine, that the falling and riſing of the Mercury depended up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the varying Weight of the Atmoſphere, ſince in this Baroſcope it cannot be pretended that a <hi>fuga vacui,</hi> or a <hi>Funiculus,</hi> is the Cauſe of the Changes we obſerve. <hi>2dly.</hi> It ſhows, that not only the Air has Weight, but a more conſiderable one than ſome learned Men, who will allow me to have proved, that it has ſome Weight, will admit. <hi>3dly.</hi> This Statical Baroſcope will often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be more parable than the other, for many will find it more eaſy to procure a good pair of Gold Scales, and a Bubble or two, than a long Cane ſeal'd, a Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of Mercury, and all the other Requiſites of the Mercurial Baroſcope, eſpecially if we comprize the Trouble and Skill that is requiſite to free the deſerted part of the Tube from Air. <hi>4thly.</hi> And whereas the Difficulty of removing the Mercurial Inſtrument has kept Men from ſo much as attempting to do it even to Neighbouring Places, the eſſential Parts of the Scale Baroſcope (for the Frame is none of them) may very eaſily in a little room be carried whereſoever one will, without the Hazard of being ſpoil'd, or injur'd. <hi>5thly.</hi> There is not in Statical Baroſcopes, as in the other, a Danger of Uncertainty, as to the Goodneſs of the Inſtrument, by reaſon, that in the Mercurial the Air is in ſome more, and in ſome leſs, perfectly excluded; whereas in <hi>theſe</hi> that Conſideration has no Place. <hi>6thly.</hi> It being, as I formerly intimated, very poſſible
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:100378:55"/>
to diſcover Hydroſtatically, both the Bigneſs of the Bubble, and the Contents of the Cavity, and the Weight and Dimenſions of the glaſſy Subſtance (which together with the included Air make up the Bubble) much may be diſcovered by this Inſtrument, as to the Weight of the Air, abſolute or reſpective. For when the Mercury in the Mercurial Baroſcope is either very high, or very low, or at a middle Station between its greateſt and leaſt Height, bringing the Scale-Baroſcope to an exact <hi>Equilibrium</hi> (with very minute Diviſions of a Grain) you may by watchfully obſerving, when the Mercury is riſen or fallen juſt an Inch, or a <hi>4th,</hi> or <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> of an Inch. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and putting in the like minute Diviſions of a Grain to the lighter Scale, till you have again brought the Ballance to an <hi>Equilibrium,</hi> you may, I ſay, determine what known Weight in the Statical Baroſcope, anſwers ſuch determinate Altitudes of the aſcending and deſcending Mercury in the Mercurial: And if your Ballance be accommodated with a divided Arch, or a Whele and Index, theſe Obſervations will aſſiſt you for the future, to determine, by ſeeing the Inclination of the Tongue, or the Degree mark'd by the Index, to conclude readily, what Potency the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble has, by the Change of the Atmoſphere's Weight, acquired or loſt.</p>
               <p>Some Obſervations of this Nature I watchfully made, ſometimes putting in a <hi>64th,</hi> ſometimes a <hi>32d,</hi> ſometimes a <hi>16th,</hi> and ſometimes heavier parts of a Grain to the lighter Scale: But one that knew not for what Uſes theſe little Papers were, coming to a Window where my Baroſcope ſtood, ſo unluckily ſhook them out of the Scales, and confounded them, that he robb'd me of the Opportunity of making the nice Obſervations I intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, though I had the Satisfaction of ſeeing, that they
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:100378:56"/>
were to be made. <hi>7thly.</hi> By this Statical Inſtrument we may be aſſiſted to compare the Mercurial Baroſcopes of ſeveral Places (though never ſo diſtant) and to make ſome Eſtimates of the Gravities of the Air therein. As if, for inſtance, I have found by Obſervation, that the Bubble I imploy (and one may have made divers Bubbles of ſeveral Sizes, that the one may repair any Miſchance that may happen to another) weighed juſt a Drachm, when the Mercurial Cylinder was at the Height of 29½ Inches (which in ſome Places I have found a moderate Altitude) and that the Addition of the <hi>16th</hi> part of a Grain is requiſite to keep the Bubble in an <hi>Equilibrium,</hi> when the Mercury is riſen an <hi>8th,</hi> or any determinate part of an Inch, above the former Station: When I come to another Place, where there is a Mercurial Barometer, as well freed from Air as mine (for that muſt be ſuppoſed) if taking out my Scale-Inſtrument, it appears to weigh preciſely a Drachm; and the Mercury, in the Baroſcope there, ſtand at 29½ Inches, we may conclude, the Gravity of the Atmoſphere not to be ſenſibly unequal in both thoſe two Places, though very diſtant. And though there be no Baroſcope there, yet if there be an additio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Weight, as for inſtance, the <hi>16th</hi> part of a Grain, requiſite to be added to the Bubble, to bring the Scales to an <hi>Equilibrium,</hi> it will appear, that the Air, at this ſecond Place, is at that time ſo much heavier than the Air of the former Place was, when the Mercury ſtood at 29½ Inches. But in making ſuch Compariſons, we muſt not forget to conſider the Situation of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Places, if we mean to make Eſtimates not only of the Weight of the Atmoſphere, but of the Weight and Denſity of the Air. For though the Scales will ſhow, as hath been ſaid, whether there be a Difference of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:100378:56"/>
Weight in the Atmoſphere at the two Places; yet if one of them be in a Vale or Bottom, and the other on the Top, or ſome elevated part of a Hill, it is not to be expected, that the Atmoſphere in this latter Place, ſhould gravitate as much as the Atmoſphere in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, on which a longer Pillar of Air does lean or weigh; ſo that the Bubble in both theſe Places ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely of the ſame Weight.</p>
               <p>And the mention I have made of the differing Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Places, puts me in mind of ſomething, that may prove another Uſe of our Statical Baroſcope, and which I had Thoughts of making Trial of, but was acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally hindered from the Opportunity of doing it; namely, that by exactly poizing the Bubble, at the Foot of a high Steeple or Hill, and carrying it in its cloſe Frame to the top, one may, by the Weight requiſite to be added to the Counterpoize, there to bring the Beam to its horizontal Poſition, obſerve the Difference of the Weight of the Air at the bottom and at the top; and in caſe the Hill be high enough, at ſome intermediate Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But how this may aſſiſt Men to eſtimate the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute or comparative Height of Mountains, and other elevated Places, and what other Uſes the Inſtrument may be put to, when it is duly improved, and the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that may be requiſite in the ſeveral Caſes, which ſhall be propoſed, I muſt leave to more leiſure, and further Conſideration.</p>
               <p>I cauſed to be made with great Care, by a skilful Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical-Inſtrument-maker, <note place="margin">Weight of a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick Inch of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</note> a hollow Cube of Braſs, whoſe every Side was as exactly as could be procured, an Engliſh Inch. This we carefully counterpoiſed in a very good pair of Scales, and found it to weigh 11 Drachms, 1 Grain and ½, (Troy-Weight) Then placing it in one of the Scales as horizontally as we were able, we
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:100378:57"/>
warily fill'd it with clear common Water, (of the beſt ſort of that called Pump-water) till the Surface of the Water ſeem'd to lie as level, as we could make it, to the Brims of the Veſſel: then weighing it carefully, we found the Water alone (for the Cube had been counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poized before) to weigh 254 9/16 Grains: So that in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard 'tis ſcarce poſſible to know, that ſuch a Veſſel is ſo filled, as to come nearer Exactneſs, than within a Drop or two: I preſume we may, without any ſenſible Error, ſuppoſe an Inch of Water to weigh 256 Grains, which latter Number I rather chufe, becauſe its <hi>aliquot</hi> Parts make it more convenient, and it agrees well enough with ſome Trials, that I made with ſolid Cubes, to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the true Weight of a Cubick Inch of Water.</p>
               <p>This done, the Veſſel was well dried within, and the ſame Scales being well counterpoized, the Inſtrument was ſo too, and being placed on one of the Scales as Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontically as we could, Mercury (diſtilled to have it more pure) was warily put into it, till by Degrees it had filled the Veſſel as to Sight; but we neither expected, nor found, that it would be brought to an exact Level, and exquiſitly fill all the Corners of the Veſſel. But when it ſeem'd to be ſo well filled, that even a critical Eye could not readily find fault with it, though the Mercury appeared capable of ſome Acceſſion without overflowing, we weighed the Quickſilver it ſelf (for <note place="margin">The Weight of a Cubick Inch of Quick-ſilver.</note> the Veſſel had been counterpoized before) and found it to weigh 7 Ounces, 2 Drachms, (Troy) which falling ſomewhat ſhort (though not very much) of what the above-mention'd Weight of the Water required, we tried to add a little more Quickſilver, without making it run over, and found the Increaſe of 82 Grains; ſo that now the Quickſilver weighed 7 Ounces, 3 Drachms, 22 Grains; but it ſeem'd when the Eye was placed in a
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:100378:57"/>
Level with the Brims of the Veſſel, that it was rather a little of the higheſt, than any way depreſſed, and yet was not ſo full, but that we could add 112 Grains to the former Weight, without making it run over; and perhaps we might have added yet more, but I decline doing it, becauſe the laſt mentioned Acceſſion ſeem'd manifeſtly to make it ſo much ſwell above the Brims of the Veſſel. By all which 'tis evident that 'tis ſcarce poſſible to determine preciſely by ſuch hollow Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the true Weight of a Cubick Inch of Quick-ſilver. And therefore, ſince by other ways of Trial, I have found the Proportion of the Weight of Mercury to Water of the ſame Bulk, to be ſomewhat leſs than that of 14 to 1, I think we may, without any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Inconvenience, ſuppoſe the Weight of a Cubick Inch of Quick-ſilver to be 3580 Grains, which is near 14 times the above-mentioned Weight of a Cubick Inch of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and comes near enough to the ſecond or middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of the three Eſtimates lately ſet down; and by the leaſt Eſtimate of all it appears that a Cubick Inch of Quickſilver weighs 7¼ Ounces Troy Weight, that is 8 Ounces Averdupois Weight: And conſequently when the Quickſilver of the Baroſcope, kept up by the Counterpoize of the Air 30 Inches, (as I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it ſeveral times to be within a Month laſt paſt) the Weight of the Air that is incumbent on an Inch <note place="margin">The Weight of a Pillan of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere.</note> Square here below, amounts to 18 <hi>l.</hi> ⅛ Troy Weight; that is in Averdupois Weight 15 <hi>l.</hi> 1/17.</p>
               <p>As 11 to 14, or rather as 355 to 452, ſo is the Area of a Square inſcribed in a Circle to the Area of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed Circle.</p>
               <p>Hence 355: 452:: 1: 1, 2732394.</p>
               <p>Hence if the ſide of an inſcribed Square be an Inch,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:100378:58"/>
that multiplied by an Inch, renders a Cubick Inch for the ſolid Content.</p>
               <p>In like manner if the Height of a Cylinder erected on the circumſcribing Circle, be an Inch, the ſolid Content of that Cylinder is 1,2732394.</p>
               <p>Wherefore 1, and 1, 2732394 multiplied, by the Weight of the Cubick Inch of any kind of Metal, give the Weight of a Cubick Inch, and of a Cylindrick Inch that circumſcribes the ſame, whence an Inch Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for both is eaſily made, by continual Addition, or for any Height propounded, multiplying both by the ſame.</p>

               <head>An Explication of the foregoing Regiſter.</head>
               <p>THE firſt Column with <hi>d</hi> at the Top, contains the Day of the Month.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Column with <hi>h</hi> at the Top, contains the Hour of the Day, which beginning from Midnight, I count to 24, which is Midnight again; ſo that 13 ſtands for 1 Afternoon, and ſo on.</p>
               <p>The third Column with <hi>Th.</hi> at the Top, marks the Degrees of my Thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope, which having been blown at a Lamp, though the Spaces of the Degrees were equally divided, yet becauſe of the unequal Bigneſs of the ſmall Tube, towards the Extremities, where it grew bigger, it did not always in every De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree mark equally proportionable Degrees of Heat and Cold. The Points to be obſerved in that and the next Column, which is that for the Baroſcope, ſhew the juſt Place where the Top of the tinged Spirit of Wine in the one, and the Mercury in the other, ſtood between the Line of the Degree marked, and the following, when the Obſervation was made. The Thermoſcope I made uſe of till <hi>December,</hi> 1669, was a ſeal'd one, with all the Degrees in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing with the Heat in one continued Series. The Thermoſcope which I uſed from <hi>Decemb.</hi> 1669. to <hi>June</hi> 1675. and is marked 2. was one of Mr. <hi>Cotgraves</hi> adjuſting, which beginning the reckoning from the temper of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, hath the Numbers increaſing both upwards and downwards; the Points ſhew it to be in the Degrees; above 0, if ſet over; and under 0, if ſet under: and ˙ ˙˙ or ˙˙˙ ſhew it higher or lower in each Degree. The Thermoſcope uſed from <hi>March</hi> 1681, to the End, is marked 3, and is of the kind of that uſed firſt.</p>
               <p>The Column having <hi>Hy.</hi> at the Top, contains the Degrees of Moiſture, as marked by an Hygroſcope made of the Beard of a wild Oat.</p>
               <p>In the Column of the Wind, I not having the Convenience to obſerve the Points exactly, have marked but 8, but yet with this Variety, that where I ſet two Letters, the Wind was moſt from that Point whoſe Letter ſtands firſt, <hi>v. g.</hi> W N ſignifies more Weſt than North. When I ſet only one Letter, it was in or very near that Cardinal Point.</p>
               <p>The Strength is marked by 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. 0 ſignifies not ſo much Wind that mov'd any Leaf that I could ſee in a Garden I look'd into out of my Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, but the Letter join'd to it ſignifies which way the Weather-Cock then ſtood, whether the former Wind left it ſo, or the preſent Breeze blew that way. 1 ſignifies a gentle Gale, juſt perceivable by the moving of the Leaves or Plants. 4 ſignifies a very violent Storm: 2 and 3 the ſeveral Degrees be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween 1 and 4, as well as I could judg. Theſe Degrees, though not ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly meaſured as I could have wiſh'd, I yet thought better than nothing.</p>

               <p>HAving gotten together all the ſurveighing Chains the City afforded, and carefully examined their Truth, and having prepared a proper Frame for the Baroſcope, we went into the Church, filled the Tube, and with all the Nicety we could uſe, purged it of the airy Particles, and then immerſing it, as in the Forricel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Experiment, the Mercury was there ſuſpended 30 Inches, and 50 Cents of an Inch, meaſuring it from the Surface of the <hi>Stagnum:</hi> Then drawing it up to the firſt Floor above the Vaulting, which is 1033 Inches and ½ high from the Pavement, the Mercury ſubſided 9 Cents of an Inch: From thence drawing it up to the middle Floor, which is 935 Inches higher, the Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubſided 8 Cents lower than before: And from thence drawing it up to the Weather-Door, which is 2313 Inches higher than the laſt, the Mercury ſubſided 23 Cents below its laſt Station.

               <p>At a Place in the great Continent in <hi>Europe,</hi> but not far from the Ocean, a learned Acquaintance of mine keeping a Baroſcope ſome Years, and being diſcours'd with by me, about the Difference of the Phaenomena that may be expected in Places ſituate upon the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, from what we find in this Country, as it is an Iſland: He related to me, that a few Years ſince, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

his Eyes upon the Baroſcope, in ordinary Weather, and that was calm enough; he was ſurprized to ſee the Mercury ſo ſtrangely raiſed, as to exceed above two Inches its wonted Station, which great Alteration he found within few Hours to have been the Fore-runner of ſo hideous a Storm as was generally wondred at, and did a great deal of Miſchief both in the Towns and Country of thoſe Parts, where it left ſad Inſtances of its Fury. This Wind came all along the Continent: but my Relator divers times obſerved, that when very boiſterous Winds blew from the Sea, and the Storms came thence, (which lying to the Southward) the Mercuty in the Baroſcope would conſiderably ſubſide, as has likewiſe been often obſerved here in <hi>England</hi> by an ingenious Gentleman, living within leſs than two Leagues of the Sea, to whom I preſented a Baroſcope to make Obſervations with.</p>

And accordingly it happened within a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four or five Hours; that the Sky was all over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt; and there fell a hideous Storm of Rain, Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Thunder, accompanied with ſuch a Whirl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind,

                     <p>I Have been able to do ſo little in the Attempts I have made to ſerve you, that I am aſhamed to have been ſo well furniſhed to ſo ſmall purpoſe. The Barometer I had from you was conveyed ſafe into the Country, and as ſoon as it came to my Hands, I rode to <hi>Minedeep,</hi> with an Intention to make uſe of it there, in one of the deepeſt Gruffs (for ſo they call their Pits) I could find: the deepeſt I could hear of was about 30 Fathom, but the Deſcent ſo far either from eaſy, ſafe, or perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular, that I was diſcouraged from venturing on it. They do not, as in Wells, ſink their Pits ſtrait down, but, as the Cranies of the Rocks, give them the eaſieſt Paſſage; neither are they let down by a Rope, but ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Rope under their Arm, by ſetting their Hands and Legs againſt the ſides of the narrow Paſſage, clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber up and down, which is not very eaſy for one not uſed to it, and almoſt impoſſible to carry down the Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rometer, both the Hands being imployed. This Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation I ſhould have ſuſpected to come from their Fear, had not an intelligent Gentleman, Neighbour to the Hill, aſſured me 'twas their uſual way of getting up and down. For the Sight of the Engine, and my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of going down into ſome of their Gruffs, gave them terrible Apprehenſions, and I could not perſwade them but that I had ſome Deſign: So that I and a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman that bore me Company, had a pleaſant Scene,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:100378:76"/>
whilſt their Fear to be undermined by us, made them disbelieve all we told them; and do what we could, they would think us craftier Fellows than we were. But, Sir, I will not trouble you with the Particulars of this Adventure: but certain it is the Women too were alarm'd, and think us ſtill either Projectors or Conjurers. Since I could not get down into their Gruffs, I made it my Buſineſs to inquire what I could concerning them: The Workmen could give me very little Account of any thing, but what Profit made them ſeek after; they could apprehend no other Minerals but Lead Oar, and believed the Earth held nothing elſe worth ſeeking for: beſides, they were not forward to be too communicative to one, they thought they had Reaſon to be afraid of. But at my Return, calling at a Gentleman's Houſe, who lives under <hi>Minedeep-</hi>Hills, and who had ſent out his Son to invite me in; amongſt other things he told me this, that ſometimes the Damps catch them, and then if they cannot get out ſoon enough, they fall into a Swound, and die in it, if they are not ſpeedily got out; and as ſoon as they have them above ground, they dig a Hole in the Earth, and there put in their Faces, and cover them cloſe up with Turfs; and this is the ſureſt Remedy they have yet found to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover them. In deep Pits they convey down Air by the ſide of the Gruff, in a little Paſſage from the Top; and that the Air may circulate the better, they ſet up ſome Turfs on the Lee ſide of the Hole, to catch, and ſo force down the freſh Air: But if theſe Turfs be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to the windy ſide, or laid cloſe over the Mouth of the Hole, thoſe below find it immediately, by want of Breath, Indiſpoſition, and Fainting: and if they ehance to have any ſweet Flowers with them, they do not only loſe their pleaſant Smell immediately, but

ſtink as bad as Carrion. Notwithſtanding this ill Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, I had attempted ſome Trials once more, had not the ſpreading of the Contagion made it leſs ſafe to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture abroad, and haſtened me out of the Country ſooner than I intended.

At my return to the bottom of the Hill, the Mercury wanted of aſcending to its former Height <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">

I know this is far ſhort of what you might have expected, and has, I fear, but little anſwered your Deſires, ſince I gueſs it was the perpendicular Height of the Place I made the Experiment in, that you would have had, and perhaps other Conſiderations of Air, incloſed, and liable to mineral Steams, would have made a Trial in one of the Gruffs more acceptable to you. I do not think any thing in this Letter worthy of you, or fit for the Publick. But ſince I find by the two laſt Philoſophical Tranſactions, that Obſervations on the Torricellian Experiment are much look'd after, and
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100378:77"/>
deſired to be compared; if for want of better, this ſhould be thought fit to fill an empty Space in the Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical News-Book, I ſhall deſire to have my Name concealed. But I fear that this very Caution of being in Print, where there is no Danger of it, has too much of Vanity in it. I'm ſure 'tis Boldneſs enough, though allaid with Obedience, to venture ſuch ſlight things to your Sight. I viſited the incruſting Spring I formerly mentioned to you, and could not find any thing incruſted within at leaſt 20 Yards of the Riſe of it. The Place where it works moſt, is about 40 or 50 Yards from the Spring-head, and is at a Fall higher than my Head: there it ſheaths every thing with ſtony Caſes, and makes the ſides of the Bank hard Rock, and from thence all along its Stream, it covers Sticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with a Cruſt; and ſome ſo candied I found above this Fall, but not ſo frequent; whether the mixing of Air with the Water in the Fall, contributes any thing to the Effect, I cannot gueſs; but that the Fall does, I ſuppoſe: for beſides that at the above-mentioned Fall, it ſeems to operate moſt ſtrongly, I obſerved, that though I could not find any thing incruſted within a good Diſtance of the Spring, yet that the Moſs above the Spring was a little incruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, (but not ſo firmly as at the other Place) for the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Winter, when the Springs are full, runs out alſo at a Hole two or three Yards above the Place, where now only it riſes, and from thence falls perpendicularly into this lower Spring, from whence it runs by an eaſy Deſcent to the next Fall. A Gentleman in whoſe Field it riſes, and by whoſe Houſe it runs, told me upon Inquiry, that he uſes it both in his Kitchen and Brew-houſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſenſible ill Effects, he being a pretty ancient, but healthy Man, and long Inhabitant of that Place. It will bear Soap, freezes quickly; and waters his Grounds up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

Occaſion, with Advantage. All the ill Effects of it, that he can gueſs, are, that his Horſes are uſually ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breathed, which he imputes to the drinking of that Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.

               <p>Some Days ago the King doing me the Honour to diſcourſe with me about the Uſe of Baroſcopes, was pleaſed to ſay, among other remarkable things, that at a time his Majeſty then named, he went from <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi> about ſix in the Morning, towards the Mouth of the River, attended by divers of the Nobility, and particularly by one of the Lords then preſent, whom his Majeſty put in Mind of the Adventure; and then he added, that though the Weather were exceeding fair, and likely to continue ſo, inſomuch that ſome of the Courtiers congratulated to his Majeſty ſo promiſing a Morning; yet when they were once gone too far to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100378:78"/>
he told them he thought they would be much miſtaken, and that they were to prepare for a Storm; which Conjecture his Majeſty grounded upon his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, unknown to the Company, conſulted a good Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſcope before he went out, and found the Mercury in it to have ſuddenly, and very notably ſubſided. And accordingly within a very few Hours the Event verified his Majeſty's Prediction, a ſudden Storm driving on the Yatch he was in, for divers Leagues, at a very unuſual rate.</p>
               <p>Nous apprenons de ces experiences, que puiſque le poids de l' Air et le poids de l' eau qui eſt dans les Pompes ſe tiennent mutuellement en Equilibre, ils peſent pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſement autant l' un que l' autre; &amp; qu' ainſi en con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſant la hauteur ou l' eau s' éleve en tous les lieux du monde, nous connoiſſons en meſme temps combien cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cun de ces lieux eſt preſſé par le poids de l' Air qui eſt au deſſus d' eux; et partant.</p>
               <p>Que les lieux, qui ſont au bord de la mer, ſont preſſez par le poids de l' Air, qui eſt au deſſus d' eux juſques au haut de ſa Sphere, autant preciſement, que ſi au lieu de cét Air on ſubſtituoit une colomne d' eau de la hauteur de 31 Pieds deux poulces.</p>
               <p>Ceux qui ſont plus élevez de dix toiſes, autant que s' ils portoient de l' eau de la hauteur de 31 Pieds un poulce.</p>
               <p>Ceux qui ſont élevez audeſſus de la mer de 500 Toiſes, autant que s' ils portoient de l' eau à la hauteur de 26 Pieds onze poulces: &amp; ainſi du reſte.</p>
               <p>Nous apprenons par ces experiences que l' Air qui eſt ſur le niveau de la mer peſe autant que l' eau, à la hau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teur de 31 Pieds deux poulces; mais parce que l' Air
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100378:78"/>
peſe moins ſur les lieux plus élevez que ſur le niveau de la mer; et qu' ainſi il ne peſe pas ſur tous les Points de la terre egalement, &amp; meſine qu' il peſe differemment par tout, on ne peut pas prendre un pied fixe, qui marque combien tous les lieux du monde ſont Chargez par l' Air, le fort portant le foible; mais on peut en prendre un par conjecture bien approchant du juſte; comme par exemple, on peut faire eſtat, que tous les lieux de la terre en general conſiderez comme s' ils eſtoient égale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment chargez d' Air, le fort portant le foible, en ſont autant preſſez, que s' ils partoient de l' eau à la hauteur de 31 Pieds; et il eſt certain qu' il n' y a pas un demy pied d' eau d' erreur en cette Suppoſition.</p>
               <p>Or nous avons veu que l' Air qui eſt au deſſus des montagnes hautes de 500. toiſes ſur le niveau de la mer, peſe autant que l' eau à la hauteur de 26 Pieds 11 Poulces.</p>
               <p>Et par conſequent tout l' Air qui s' étend de puis le niveau de la mer juſqu' au haut des montagnes, hautes de 500 Toiſes, peſe autant que l' eau à la hauteur de 4 Pieds un poulce, qui eſtant à peu prés la ſeptiéme partie de la hauteur entiere; il eſt viſible que l' Air com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pris depuis la mer juſques à ces montagnes eſt à peu pres la ſeptiéme partie de la maſſe entiere de l' Air.</p>
               <p>Nous apprenons de ces meſmes Experiences, que les vapeurs qui ſont épaiſſes dans l' Air, lors qu' il en eſt le plus Chargé, peſent autant que l' eau à la hauteur d' un pied huit Poulces; puiſque pour les contrepeſer, elles font houſſer l' eau dans les Pompes à cette hauteur, par deffus celle ou l' eau contrepeſoit déja la peſanteur de l' Air: de ſorte que ſi toutes les vapeurs qui ſont ſur une contrée eſtoient reduites en eau, comme il arrive quand elles ſe changent en pluye, elles ne pourroient produire que cette hauteur d' un pied huit poulces d' eau ſur cette
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:100378:79"/>
contrée. Et s' il arrive par fois des orages ou l' eau de la pluye qui tombe vienne à une plus grande hauteur; c' eſt parce que le vent y porte les vapeurs des contrées voiſines.</p>
               <p>Nous voyons auſſi de là, que ſi toute la Sphere de l' Air eſtoit preſſée &amp; comprimée contre la terre par une Force qui la pouſſant par le haut, la reduiſiſt en bas à la moindre place qu' elle puiſſe occuper, &amp; qu' elle la re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duiſiſt comme en l' eau, elle auroit alors la hauteur de 31 Pieds ſeulement.</p>
               <p>Et par conſequent qu' il faut conſiderer toute la maſſe de l' Air en l' eſtat libre ou elle eſt, de la meſme ſorte que ſi elle euſt eſte autrefois comme une maſſe d' eau de 31 pieds de haut á l' entour de toute la terre, qui euſt eſté rarefiée et dilatée extremement, et convertie en cet eſtat ou nous l' appellons Air, auquel elle occupe à la verite plus de place, mais auquel elle conſerve preciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment le meſme poids que l' eau à 31 pieds de haut.</p>
               <p>Et comme il n' y auroit rien de plus aiſé que de ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puter combien l' eau qui environneroit toute la terre à 31 Pieds de haut peſeroit de livres; et qu' un enfant qui ſcait l' Addition et la Souſtraction le pourroit faire; on trouveroit par le meſme moyen combien tout l' Air de la Nature peſe de liures, puiſque c' eſt la meſme choſe; et ſi on en fait l' épreuve, on trouvera qu' il peſe à peu prés huit Millions de Millions de Millions de Liures.</p>
               <p>I' ay voulu avoir ce plaiſir, et j' en ay fait le compte en cette ſorte.</p>
               <p>I' ay ſuppoſe que le Diametre d' un cercle eſt à ſa cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conference, comme 7 á 22.</p>

Then two Fire-ſhovels, with ſmall Coals and Aſhes were applied at a convenient Diſtance, and kept moving to warm and rarify the included Air, without crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bladder, by which means after ſome of the Wrinckles of the Bladder had been diſplayed, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Noiſe, the Air being expanded, and conſequently the Bladder a little ſwell'd, and the whole String ſhorten'd, the Weight was raiſed and made to ſwing like a Pendulum.

that is new and pertinent; but yet ſince this Title pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes not any thing about Cold in general, but only ſome leſs heeded Particulars, relating to the Coldneſs of the Air: That I may not leave it wholly unfurniſhed, I will refer to it a few Inſtances that enſue.</p>
            <p>The Phyſician, elſewhere mentioned, that was lately at <hi>Morocco,</hi> anſwered me, that notwithſtanding the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Heat that reign'd there in the Day-time, he felt the Night very cold, and ſo he did the mountanous Air in thoſe Parts.</p>
            <p>An intelligent Gentleman that ſtay'd a Year in <hi>Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nea,</hi> and ſpent part of that time in the Land, anſwer'd me, that notwithſtanding the exceſſive Heat of the Climate, he was divers times about four of the Clock in the Morning, reduced to be ready to tremble for Cold, as he lay in his Hammock, for about an Hour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
            <p>A learned Man that lived at <hi>Jamaica,</hi> aſſured me, that when he laid in his Hammock, about three or four Foot from the Ground, though he had much Clothes under him, and little or none over him, he felt it cold beneath, and hot above.</p>
            <p>'Tis obvious to every Man's Senſe or Obſervation; that the greater Heat that is uſually found in our Air, during the Summer, than in other Seaſons of the Year, has manifeſt Effects upon ſuch eaſily agitable Bodies as Liquors, and upon the Juices and Fleſh of Animals, and the ſofter Parts of Vegetables. But that even in Places ſhelter'd from the Sun-beams, the Warmth of a temperate Summer ſhould be able ſenſibly to rarify and expand ſo cold and compact a Body, as Glaſs it ſelf, would not be eaſily ſuſpected or believed. And yet that this is one of the Effects of the Temperature of the Air in Summer, ſeems very probable by this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:100378:83"/>
that having two large factitious Cryſtal Viols, cauſed ſome Stopples of the ſame Matter to be exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely ground, and fitted this or that Veſſel, exactly cloſed when the Stopple was in it, was very eaſy to be opened in Winter, and in the colder Parts of the Neighbouring Seaſons; but in Summer 'twas often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo difficult to unſtop the ſame Veſſel, that a Man's Force, though aſſiſted with a String, was not able to pull out the Stopple: To that I was often reduced to cauſe the Necks of the Vials to be held under a Pump, or to be ſtirred to and fro in a Veſſel full of Water, that the Coldneſs of that Liquor might take off the Expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that the Heat of the Seaſon had given the Glaſs, which being by this means made to ſhrink into its former Dimenſions, the Vial and Stopple would be eaſily e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough disjoined. This was tried in ſeveral Veſſels, and in more than one Year. But to make this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſucceſsful, two Parts muſt at firſt have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitly adjuſted to one another, which in thoſe Glaſſes, with Stopples of the ſame Matter that are commonly ſold, they are not uſually found to be.</p>
            <p>We are wont to attribute the Effects we feel of the Summers Heat, to the bare Warmth of the Air, and to the Agitations that ſuch Warmth produces in the Parts of our Bodies, eſpecially in the Blood, Juices and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, whereas it may very well happen, that we may find odd Changes in our ſelves, upon very hot Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which proceed not from the Heat of the Air, as ſuch, but rather from this Cauſe, that by ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Heat, divers Bodies that we think not of, may be ſolicited to ſend forth <hi>Effluvia</hi> that have emitted none by Force, or at leaſt no ſuch Quantity as could make them ſenſibly operative. And theſe <hi>Effluvia</hi> may be the true and immediate Cauſes of divers Effects that
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:100378:83"/>
are unwarily aſcribed to the mere Heat of the Air, and that which it produces in our Bodies. To illuſtrate and confirm this Conjecture, I ſhall propoſe the following Experiment.</p>
            <p>Being in the Heat of Summer in the Country, I took a ſome-what large Piece of fine Amber, that I uſually imployed about Electrical Experiments; and when the Sun had reach'd a conſiderable Height above the Horizon, I placed it in a ſhaded Part of a Window, on which he ſhined freely, though I left the Amber here for a competent time, yet I could not find that it would draw a Piece of Straw, Feather, or other light Body, that at a convenient Diſtance was held to it. But when I removed it a very little further into a Part of the Window, into which the Sun-beams fell freely, they quickly put its Parts into ſuch an Agitation as made it emit Electrical <hi>Effluvia,</hi> and readily attract thoſe light Bodies that would not ſtir before, and which it would ſoon, though not immediately, loſe the Power of drawing, as before, if it were removed back into the neighbouring ſhaded part of the Window.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 26. Mr. <hi>Nickſon,</hi> who was four Years Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Engliſh Colony in <hi>Hudſons-Bay,</hi> anſwered me, that when they ſail'd within a certain Diſtance of floating Iſlands of Ice, if the Wind blew from thence toward the Ship, or as the Seamen ſpeak, if they were to the Leeward of the Ice, they could by the new and ſenſible Cold they felt, know that ſuch Ice lay to Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of them, ſometimes even before they were able to diſcover it by Sight. And when I further asked, at what Diſtance that might be, he anſwered, that 'twas ſometimes twelve or fifteen Miles, if not twenty. He added, that uſually when the Wind blew from thoſe great Maſſes of congealed Water, it brought along with
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:100378:84"/>
it a foggy Air, which he ſuppoſed to come (as well as the Cold) from the Ice.</p>
            <p>The ſame Gentleman, anſwer'd me, that in that Part of <hi>Hudſons-Bay</hi> wherein he winter'd, the Rivers began to freeze about the latter end of <hi>October,</hi> or beginning of <hi>November,</hi> and uſually were not free from Ice till about the middle or latter end of <hi>May,</hi> though he divers times took the Latitude of <hi>Charleton Iſland,</hi> the Place moſt frequented by the Engliſh, and ſeated at the bottom of the Bay, and found it to be near the ſame with that of <hi>London,</hi> and at moſt but about 52 Degrees.</p>
            <p>When I inquired about the Depth of the Ice in the Rivers, he anſwered, that they had often occaſion to obſerve it; for in the Winter they made their Wells there, (not in the Ground) and were obliged to dig about ſix Foot deep in the Ice, before they could come at unfrozen Water.</p>
            <p>He anſwered me, that when they ſent their Men up into the Country, their Bottles of Brandy would often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo freeze, that about a fourth Part of it would be turned into Ice. And when I asked, whether the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frozen Part of the Liquor was not exceeding ſtrong, he anſwered me, that it was, and ſometimes ſo much ſo, as to be too fiery and unpleaſant to the Taſte.</p>
            <p>He anſwered me, that he always found the Ice freſh that floated upon the Sea-Water; and that when they wanted freſh Water, or had a Mind to ſpare what they had aboard, they often ſupplied themſelves out of the Cavities of great floating Maſſes of Ice; in which hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Places the Sun-Beams thawing ſome Parts of the Ice, they frequently found ſtore of Liquor that was produced by the Action of the Sun-Beams upon the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Parts of the Ice, whence the Water ran into theſe Cavities. He added, that when the Seamen were
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:100378:84"/>
in haſte, they uſed to relieve themſelves by cutting or breaking off Pieces of the floating Ice, and preſently melting it in their Pots.</p>
            <p>A learned Traveller, that made ſome conſiderable ſtay among the high Pyrenean Mountains, anſwer'd me, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other notable things, about which I made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, that he had ſeveral times obſerved at the Top of one or other of thoſe tall Hills, that the Air would be very hot, and that yet the ſame Day, and perhaps within very few Hours, the Place would be cover'd with Snow, though it were then Summer-time.</p>
            <p>Doctor <hi>N.</hi> anſwered me, that the Winds he felt at <hi>Morocco</hi> were ſo very hot, that they were ready to ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle him, ſeeming to him like the Steams and Smoak coming out of the Mouth of an Oven.</p>
            <p>The Ruſſian Emperor's Phyſician confirmed to me, that at <hi>Arch-angel</hi> (where he was more than once) they averr'd to him, that in Winter-time a Northerly Wind (which comes from the Sea) produces a kind of Thaw, ſo as to make the Eves drop, though a North-Eaſt Wind rather confirms the Froſt; but on the contrary, a Southerly Wind blows over a thouſand or a hundred Mile of frozen Land, does rather increaſe the Froſt than bring the Thaw.</p>
            <p>A very inquiſitive Perſon that viſited the lofty Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nean Mountains, anſwered me, that he and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had more than once obſerved, from the Top or higher Part of one of thoſe Hills, that though it were fair Weather there, yet a great way beneath them, the Hill was ſurrounded with thick Clouds, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced Storms of Rain on the lower Grounds: and that (which was the chief Point, I inquired after) they could manifeſtly ſee, that out of thoſe Clouds, when it thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, Lightnings flaſh'd upwards, as well as they are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally obſerv'd to do it downward.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="tcp:100378:85"/>
               <hi>October</hi> 19. Doctor <hi>Stubbs</hi> aſſured me, that having at <hi>Jamaica</hi> taken a Bolt-head about two Foot and a half in length, he uſually found that betwixt 7 and 8 in the Morning, which they there call the faint time (of the Day) becauſe for want of the daily Breezes, the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Heat makes them to faint away; the Water was wont to riſe in the Neck but a quarter of an Inch and a half, though at that time by reaſon of the Winds, Men found the Heat very ſupportable: and after Noon was paſt, the Water would ſubſide by Degrees till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the above-mention'd time the next Morning. This happened in a South Window, where the freſh Winds come fully and freely in to beat upon the Bolt-head, without any Glaſs to skreen the Veſſel from the Wind.</p>
            <p>He added, that though the Bolt-head were not ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, yet the Water did not even in that hot Country decreaſe ſenſibly in eight or ten Months.</p>
            <p>A heedful Perſon that frequented the Coaſt of <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matra</hi> in the South-Sea, anſwered me, that he never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Ice or Froſt, or Snow, in that great Iſland, but that he had known Hail fall even in that torrid Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</p>
            <p>Though the famous Iſland of <hi>Ceylon</hi> lies almoſt in the midſt of the torrid Zone, namely, between the <hi>6th</hi> and <hi>10th</hi> Degrees of Northern Latitude, yet an obſerving Man that lived many Years upon it, told me, that in Hills not ſo high, but that we might eaſily aſcend to the Top in half an Hour, the Inequality of the Air's Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature, as to Heat and Cold, was very great: for he had divers times obſerved in himſelf and others, that though at the bottom of the Hill the Heat was ſo great, as to oblige them to go almoſt ſtark naked, yet when they aſcended the Hill, they found the Air quite al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd;
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:100378:85"/>
and as they went up higher and higher, the Cold increaſed upon them; ſo that notwithſtanding the Heat, ſo uneaſy a Motion as Climbing, had given them, the Coldneſs of the Air obliged them to put on unuſually warm Clothes; and at the Top of the Hill they would for all that be ready to quake for Cold.</p>
            <p>Captain <hi>Knox</hi> anſwered me, that in 18 Years that he ſpent in the Inland of <hi>Ceylon,</hi> he never obſerv'd any Ice or Snow, nor any more than a little kind of Meteor that was between Dew and hoar Froſt, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Winter-Mornings appeared very oddly, but quickly vaniſhed. And when I asked if he had not ſeen Hail it ſelf; he anſwered, that he never ſaw it but once, but the Inhabitants look'd upon it as a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful thing, unſeen by them before, that the Hail was as large as a black Cherry, but not very round, and ſeem'd to have the Corners melted, which made him think it had been form'd high in the Air; that for fear of miſtaking, he not only gather'd ſome of it, but champ'd it between his Teeth, and found it cold and hard, like our European Hail; and that he was fain to be nimble in making his Trials, becauſe when the Hail came to touch the Ground, it would melt away much more ſuddenly than one would have expected.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gregory</hi> being ask'd, upon a very ſultry Day, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it were not very hot in <hi>Germany,</hi> made Anſwer, To Day has been ſomething hot: Such is the Winter in <hi>Suaquena.</hi> Ludolf. <hi>Hiſt of</hi> Ethiop. <hi>l. 1. c.</hi> 5.</p>

            <p>An intelligent Perſon, that was for many Years Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul of the Engliſh Nation at <hi>Tripoli</hi> in <hi>Barbary;</hi> being asked ſome Queſtions about the Air, and the Winds in thoſe Parts, anſwered me, that when in Summer-time the Wind blew over the great Sandy Deſerts that reach very far into the Country, the Wind, and the Sand it brought along with it, oftentimes felt as hot as the Steams that come out of an Oven when the Mouth is opened, inſomuch that he could not, without great Inconvenience, turn his Face towards the Quarter whence the Wind blew.</p>
            <p>An ingenious Gentleman, that was imployed in the French Colony, on the Coaſt of <hi>Africk,</hi> and liv'd in thoſe Parts about five Years, anſwered me, that in the Iſland of St. <hi>Lovis,</hi> or near it, at a certain Seaſon of the Year, when the hot Winds blew from the Continent, the Sand on the Shores would be ſo ſcorching hot, that he was not able to ſtand upon it, but it would, through the Soles of his Shooes, ſcorch his Feet, unleſs he walked very faſt. And then the Air ſeem'd to him to be thick, and as he expreſſed it, heavy and hot, as if it came out of an Oven. And when the Wind blew from a Wood, where divers Elephants and other wild Beaſts lay dead; the Steams of their Carcaſſes would make the Air ſo ſtinking and offenſive, that is was ſcarce ſupporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

they aſcribed it to the large Tract of the Continent, and the great Woods that lay to the North-Weſt; which Woods, they ſaid, in the Winter had their Branches, through which the Wind paſt, all laden with Snow: And in the Summer, they ſaid, the cloſe Air of the Vallies, and the thick Steams that fill'd it, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſo intenſe an Heat, that ſometimes in the Heat of Summer, when a ſudden Puff of Wind blew upon their Faces from thoſe ſultry Vales, it ſeem'd to them as if it came out of the Mouth of a Furnace, and would be ready to overcome them with the Faintneſs produced by the Heat and Vapours it brought along with it.</p>

               <p>I learned, by Inquiry, of an ingenious Gentleman, who ſeveral times went down into the Hungarian Gold-Mine at <hi>Cremnitz,</hi> that when he was drawn up out of the deep Pit, or perpendicular Groove, whoſe Depth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded 100 Feer; when he had aſcended above half the way, he found the Air ſenſibly warm, and ſo it conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued till he came by many Foot nearer the Day, as the Workmen call the Orifice of the Pit. And when I ask'd whether this notable and ſuddain Heat did not proceed from ſome Mineral through which he paſſed in that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Earth, or part of the Groove; He anſwered me, that he believed it did, in regard he was there ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a Vein or Bed of native Vitriol, ſome of one Colour, ſome of another, which he found to be ſoft under Ground, though it ſoon after harden'd in the Air: and of theſe differingly colour'd ſorts of Vitriol he brought up thence ſeveral Pieces, ſome of which he preſented me. And when I ask'd whether the new Heat he found in that Part of the Mine, did not proceed
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:100378:89"/>
from its being much nearer than the lower Part to the Air, which at that time was hot; and whether he found the Heat to increaſe as he came nearer the Day: He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in the Negative, and told me, that after he had in his Aſcent left beneath him that warm Region, he found himſelf cold again in the ſuperiour Part of the Groove, to which the Vitriolate Region did not reach.</p>
               <p>I remember on this occaſion, that asking an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Perſon, who had more than once croſſed the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid Zone, what Expedient they uſed in his Ship, to keep their Beer and other Liquors, cool enough to be drinkable in thoſe ſultry Climates: He anſwered, that their way was to take the Bottle they mean to uſe, and wrap it about with a courſe Linnen Cloth dipp'd in the Sea-water, and then in ſome convenient Place of the Ship hang it in the Wind, which beating freely and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſantly upon it, would in no long time cool it to be potable enough. And this Gentleman, who was an obſerving Perſon, added farther, that having ſometimes for Curioſity ſake taken away a Bottle before it had been expoſed above half the uſual time, he was able to find by the Taſte, that part of the Beer or Wine, that was next the ſides of the Bottle to be refrigerated, whilſt the more inward Parts of the Liquor did yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue hot.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Czar's</hi> chief Phyſician confirmed to me, that in the Year 1664, or 63, extraordinary dry and great Scopes of Land were ſet on Fire, and miſerably waſted by the great Heat of the Sun. And he added, that the very laſt Year he found the like to have happened in <hi>Norway,</hi> particularly in a Place call'd by us <hi>Bear-haven;</hi> where having ſeen the Ruine of divers Wood-houſes burnt, and inquiring into the Cauſe, he was anſwered, that the Weather being very dry and hot, not only the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:100378:89"/>
Graſs and other Vegetables were ſcorch'd up, but thoſe wooden Houſes among others, were ſet on Fire; which was confirmed to him by the Governor of the Place, and countenanced by this Circumſtance, that he ſaw the Country covered with a freſh and verdent Livery of new Graſs, brought up, inſtead of that which was burnt, by ſome Rains that fell a while before.</p>
               <p>A Traveller and Scholar being ask'd by me, whether at <hi>Mozambique,</hi> which is thought the hotteſt Place in the known World, he had never obſerved the Houſes to be ſet on Fire with the mere Heat of the Sun? He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered me, that in the three Months he ſtayed there, he ſaw no ſuch thing, but the Inhabitants affirmed it not to be very unfrequent; and as he paſſed to and fro, ſhewed him divers Houſes that had been ſo burnt: which was the leſs ſtrange, becauſe the Houſes are not built of ordinary Stone, whereof they have none there, but fetch'd from another Place he named, where the Stone is mingled with a Subſtance, much of the Nature of a <hi>Sulphur Vivum.</hi> And he added, that he himſelf had divers times ſeen the Stones ſo heated in hollow Places, that Musket Bullets being expoſed there to the direct Beams of the Sun, were in no very long time melted. He ſaid farther, that much of the exceſſive Heat of <hi>Mozambique</hi> proceeded from the Soil, which is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bare and dry, conſiſting of white Sand; and that it is not covered with Graſs, nor ſhaded with Trees.</p>
               <p>An obſerving Traveller that had been at <hi>Mozambique,</hi> being for the moſt part where 'tis not ſhaded with Trees, ſandy, he found the Sun, which was almoſt in the Zenith, to heat the Ground ſo much, that he was not able to ſtand ſtill for ſome time, but was fain to keep walking to avoid burning the Soles of his Feet.</p>

               <p>Asking an intelligent Perſon that liv'd a good while in <hi>Guinea,</hi> how they did to keep their Water cool in ſo hot a Place; he told me, that in ſome Corner of their Hutts they were wont to make Holes in the Ground, in which they buried over Night the long Earthen Jarrs, or other Veſſels, ſo as that the Orifice of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels might be lower (though not very much ſo) than the Level of the Ground. By this Means the Water would become drinkable, with ſome Coolneſs, from the Beginning of the Morning to nine or ten of the Clock; after which 'twould grow diſtaſtefully hot. He added, that when they were abroad in the Fields,
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:100378:90"/>
he did as well cool his Water by putting it into Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſhes, and hanging them all Night upon the Branches of Trees, eſpecially where they were expoſed to the Wind.</p>

                  <hi>February.</hi> Since now I have ſpoken ſo much of the Cold, I hope it will not be too coldly taken, if in a few Words I make it ſome way to appear unto our Readers.</p>
               <p>We made three Differences of the Cold, all accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Places: In our Houſe, in the Woods, and in the open Air, upon the Ice, in our going to the Ship.</p>
               <p>For the laſt, it would be ſometimes ſo extream, that it was not indurable; no Clothes were Proof againſt it, no Motion could reſiſt it. It would, moreover, ſo freeze the Hair on our Eye-lids, that we could not ſee; and I verily believe, that it would have ſtifled a Man in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few Hours: We did daily find by Experience, that the Cold in the Woods would freeze our Faces, or any part of our Fleſh that was bare; but it was yet not ſo mortifying as the other. Our Houſe on the out-ſide was cover'd two third Parts with Snow; and on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide frozen and hung with Ice-ſickles. The Clothes on our Beds would be cover'd with hoar Froſt, which in this little Habitacle was not far from the Fire. But let us come a little nearer to it. The Cook's Tubs wherein he did water his Meat, ſtanding about a Yard from the Fire, and which he did all Day ply with melted Snow-water; yet in the Night-ſeaſon, whilſt he ſlept but one Watch, would they be firm frozen to the very bottom: And therefore was he fain to water his Meat in a braſs Kettle cloſe adjoining to the Fire; and I have many times both ſeen and felt, by putting my Hand into it, that ſide which was next the Fire, was very warm, and the other ſide an Inch frozen. I leave the reſt to our
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:100378:91"/>
Cook, who will almoſt ſpeak Miracles of the Cold. The Surgeon, who had hung his Bottles of Syrups, and other liquid things, as conveniently as he could, to preſerve them, had them all frozen. Our Vinegar, Oil and Sack, which we had in ſmall Casks in the Houſe, were all firm frozen. It may further in general be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that in the Beginning of <hi>June,</hi> the Sea was not broken up; and the Ground was yet frozen; and thus much we found by Experience in the burying of our Men; in ſetting up the King's Standard towards the latter End of <hi>June;</hi> and by our Well, at our coming away in the Beginning of <hi>July;</hi> at which time, upon the Land, for ſome other Reaſons, it was very hot Weather. Capt. <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Monſieur <hi>L. J.</hi> confirmed to me what he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Obſervations on the Top of the <hi>Pyreneans.</hi>
                  </note> told me, that upon the higheſt Mountain of the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reneans, called <hi>Pic De Midi,</hi> he aſcended at the End of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> or the Beginning of <hi>September</hi> (in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) to the very Top, where he and his Company ſpread a Tent, and ſtaid till the Evening: He ſays, he found the Air temperate where the Sun did not beat; but on that ſide of their Bodies whereon the Sun ſhone, the Heat was exceeding great, and was offenſive, even to them that ſat in the Tent of Oil'd Cloth, if they ſat too near the Sunny ſide of the Tent: they ſometimes had Wind at the Top of the Hill, which they found to blow cool enough, (and found it very cold when they returned to the Bottom.) This Hill is ſo high, that it may be ſeen from <hi>Montauban,</hi> which is 27 Leagues diſtant.</p>
               <p>When I asked whether the Air in thoſe Places, where the Sun did not beat, was conſiderably cold? He told me, that the Exerciſe they had been put to in aſcending the Top of the Hill (for the moſt part of the way they rid
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:100378:91"/>
up) kept them from being very competent Judges of that; but they found the Wind Northerly, though weak, yet very cooling; and the North Side of the Mountain was even then cover'd with Snow, and ſcarce at all paſſable.</p>

               <p>An eminent Virtuoſo anſwer'd me, that in <hi>Tirol</hi> he had viſited a very deep Mine into which he deſcended three hundred Klaſters, which by his Computation makes about eighteen hundred of our Feet: That he
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:100378:92"/>
paſs'd not through, that he took notice of, one hot Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion by the way. That at the Bottom of the Mine he breath'd very freely, becauſe of the Air-Shafts, by which Acceſs was given laterally to the ſuperiour Air; and that being thinly clothed with one of the Digger's Habits, he found at the Bottom the Air temperate, as to Heat and Cold, though it were then Summer-ſeaſon of the Year: ſo that notwithſtanding what is ſaid of Antiperiſtaſis, no intenſe Cold was retreated thither, to ſhun the Heat of the ſuperiour Air.</p>
               <p>An ingenious Gentleman, very converſant in our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Mines, of one of which he is Owner, anſwer'd me, that the deepeſt Mine he had particularly viſited, was a Tin Mine, whoſe Depth was ſixty ſix Fathoms, that is almoſt four hundred Foot. That deſcending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Mine in Summer, he found it very cold at the Bottom, and the greateſt part of the way going down, without perceiving any hot Region. And when I ask'd him how ſoon he begun to find a ſenſible Cold in deſcending, he told me, that he found it within two Fathom or leſs of the Orifice of the Pit; and that in this and divers other Mines he perceived a ſenſible Cold to begin before he got down a Yard, or perhaps half a Yard beneath the upper Part of the <hi>Fast,</hi> as the Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men call the ſolid Earth, in which they diſtinguiſh from the looſe Earth that lies above it; and is, if I may ſo call it, the Scurf of the Earth, that is far more light and porous than the other, though it be upon this looſe Earth that Plants grow, and into which even great Timber-trees themſelves ſhoot, and ſpread their Roots ſeldom or never reaching to, or penetrating into the <hi>Fast,</hi> though this lie ſometimes near enough to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Surface of the cruſty Earth.</p>

               <head>An exact Relation of the <hi>Pico Teneriff,</hi> taken from Mr. <hi>Clappham.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>ABout the <hi>20th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1646, Mr. <hi>Clappham,</hi> together with Mr. <hi>Philip Ward, John Webber, John Cowling, Thomas Bridge,</hi> and <hi>George Cove,</hi> all of them very conſiderable Merchants, and worthy of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, with one Guide, Servants and Horſes to carry their Wine and Proviſions, did ſet out from <hi>Oratava,</hi> a Port-Town in the Iſland of <hi>Teneriff,</hi> ſituated on the North, at two Miles Diſtance from the main Sea: They tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled from twelve at Night till eight in the Morning, by which time they got to the Top of the firſt Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains towards the <hi>Pico de Teraira;</hi> here, under a very great and conſpicuous Pine-tree they brake their Faſt, dined, and refreſhed themſelves till two in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, and then proceeded through much ſandy way, over many lofty Mountains, but naked and bare, and not covered with Pine-Trees, as their firſt Night's Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage were, which expoſed them to exceſſive Heat, till they arrived to the Foot of the <hi>Pico,</hi> where they found many huge Stones which ſeemed to have been fallen down from ſome ſuperiour Part. But before we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed further, to give any Account of this Journey, give me leave here to interſert the Opinion of Dr. <hi>Pugh,</hi> a Perſon of very great Reputation, at this time in the City, who lived twenty Years himſelf on the Place, both in the Quality of a Phyſician, and a Merchant, and was very curious and inquiſitive into all that was in the Iſland: His Opinion is, that the whole Iſland of <hi>Teneriff,</hi> being a Ground mightily impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with Brimſtone, did in former times take Fire,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:100378:93"/>
and blow up all, or near upon all at the ſame-time; and the many Mountains of huge Stones calcined and burnt, which appear every where about the Iſland, eſpecially in the South-Weſt Parts of it, were raiſed and heaved up out of the Bowels of the Earth, at the time of the general Conflagration; and the greateſt Quantity of this Sulphur lying about the Center of the Iſland, raiſed up the <hi>Pico</hi> to that Height, at which it is now ſeen. And he ſays, that any one upon the Place, that ſhall carefully note the Situation and Manner of theſe calcined Rocks, how they lie for three or four Miles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt round the bottom of the <hi>Pico,</hi> and in ſuch Order one above another, almoſt to the very Sugar-Loaf (as 'tis called) as if the whole Ground, and riſing up to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Accenſion of the Brimſtone, the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and Rivers of it did with a ſuddain Eruption roul and tumble them down from the reſt of the Rocks, eſpecially (as was ſaid before) to the South-Weſt; for on that ſide, from the very Top of the <hi>Pico,</hi> almoſt to the Sea-ſhore, lie huge Heaps of theſe burnt Rocks, one under another: and there remain to this time the very Tracts of the Rivers of Brimſtone, as they ran over all this Quarter of the Iſland, which has ſo waſted the Ground beyond recovering, that nothing can be made to grow there, but Broom. But on the North Side of the <hi>Pico,</hi> few or none of theſe Stones appear; and he concluded hence, that the <hi>Vulcano</hi> diſcharged it ſelf chiefly to South-Weſt. He adds further, that Mines of ſeveral Metals were broken and blown up at the ſame time: Theſe calcined Rocks reſembling ſome of them Iron Oar, ſome Silver, and others like Copper, particularly at a certain Place in theſe South-Weſt Parts, called the <hi>Azuleios,</hi> being very high Mountains, where never any Engliſh but himſelf (that he ever heard of)
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:100378:93"/>
was. There are vaſt Quantities of a looſe blewiſh Earth, intermix'd with blew Stones, which have on them a yellow Ruſt, as that of Copper and Vitriol; and likewiſe many little Springs of vitriolate Waters; here he ſuppoſes was a Copper-Mine. And he was told by a Bell-founder of <hi>Oratava,</hi> that out of two Horſe-Loads of Earth, he got as much Gold as made two large Rings: And a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> told him, who had been in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> that his Opinion was, there were as good Mines of Gold and Silver there, as the beſt in the <hi>Indies.</hi> There are likewiſe hereabouts ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Waters and Stones cover'd with a deep Saffron co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour'd Ruſt, and taſting of Iron. And further, he mentions one Mr. <hi>Gilbert Lambell,</hi> a Friend of his, who of two Lumps of Earth or Oar, brought from the Top of this Side the Mountain, made two Silver Spoons. All this he confirms from the late Inſtance of the <hi>Palm-Iſland</hi> eighteen Leagues from <hi>Teneriff,</hi> where a Vulcano was fired about twelve Years ſince, the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence whereof made an Earthquake in this Iſland, ſo great, that he and others ran out of their Houſes, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they would have fallen upon their Heads: They heard the Noiſe of the Torrents of flaming Brimſtone, like Thunder, and ſaw the Fire as plain by Night, for about ſix Weeks together, as a Candle in the Room; and ſo much of the Sand and Aſhes brought from thence, by the Wind, by Clouds, fell on his Hat, as filled a Sand-box for his Ink-horn. Thus far he.</p>
               <p>To reſume therefore the Narrative of their Journey; about ſix a Clock this Evening, they began to aſcend up the <hi>Pico;</hi> but being now a Mile advanced, and the way no more paſſable for their Horſes, they quitted and left them with their Servants. In this Mile's Aſcent ſome of their Company grew very faint and ſick: and
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:100378:94"/>
from Dr. <hi>Pugh</hi>'s Report of eighteen in his Company, that went up about the middle of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> long after this, but ten got up, and theſe had all drank very plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully below; the reſt ſo diſorder'd by Fluxes, Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and aguiſh Diſtempers, they could go no farther: Their Horſes Hair ſtood upright, like Briſtles, with the vehement Cold, who ſtood ſhaking, and refuſed to eat any thing till they came down. But calling for ſome of their Wine, which was carried in ſmall Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels-on a Horſe, they found it ſo wonderfully cold, that they could not drink it, till they had kindled a Fire to warm it, although yet the Temper of the Air was very calm and moderate; but when the Sun was ſet, it began to blow with Violence, and grew ſo cold, that taking up their Lodging under certain great Stones in the Rocks, they were conſtrained to keep great Fires before the Mouth of them all Night. About four in the Morning they began to mount again, and being come about a Mile up, Mr. <hi>Cowling,</hi> one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, failed, and was able to proceed no further. Here begin the black Rocks. The reſt purſued their Journey till they arrived to Sugar-Loaf, where they begin to travel again in a white Sand, being fore-ſhod with Shoes, whoſe ſingle Soles are made a Finger broader than the upper Leather, to incounter this difficult and unſtable Paſſage, till they are half way up; and a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel that went up afterwards with Dr. <hi>Pugh,</hi> (as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates) went crying all the way, having his Skin burnt off his Feet; and then being aſcended as far as the black Rocks, which are all flat, and lie like a Pavement, they climbed within a Mile of the very Top of the <hi>Pico:</hi> but Mr. <hi>Clappham,</hi> who was the formoſt, would have perſwaded Mr. <hi>Cove</hi> to deſcend again, as imagining the Top of all on Fire: but at laſt overcoming that
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:100378:94" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Apprehenſion, and perſiſting, they gained the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mite, where they found no ſuch Smoak as appeared a little below, but a continual Breathing of a hot and ſulphurous Vapour, which made their Faces extreamly ſore.</p>
               <p>In this Paſſage they found no conſiderable Alteration of Air, and very little Wind; but being at the Top, it was ſo impetuous, that they had much ado to ſtand againſt it, whilſt they drank the King's Health, and fired each of them a Piece: Here they alſo brake-faſt, but found their Strong-Waters had quite loſt its Force, and was become almoſt inſipid, whilſt their Wine was rather more ſpirituous and brisk than it was before.</p>
               <p>The Top on which they ſtood being not above a Yard broad, is the Brink of a Pit called the <hi>Caldera,</hi> which they judged to be about a Musket-ſhot over, and near fourſcore Yards deep, in ſhape like a Cone, within hollow like a Caldron, and all over cover'd with ſmall looſe Stones, mixed with Sulphur and Sand, from Heat; and ſtirr'd up with any thing, puffs and makes a Noiſe, and ſo offenſive, that Dr. <hi>Pugh</hi> was almoſt ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled with the ſudden Emanation of Vapours, upon the removing of one Stone of theſe; theſe Stones are ſo hot, as they are not to be eaſily handled: They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended not above four or five Yards into the <hi>Caldera,</hi> in regard of its ſliding from their Feet, and the Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty; but ſome have adventured to the Bottom. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obſervable Materials they diſcovered none, beſides a clearer ſort of Sulphur, which looks like Salt upon the Stones.</p>
               <p>From this famous <hi>Pico</hi> they could ken the <hi>Grand Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries,</hi> fourteen Leagues diſtant; <hi>Palma</hi> 18, and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mera</hi> 7 Leagues; which Interval of Sea ſeemed to them no larger than the River of <hi>Thames</hi> about <hi>London:</hi> they
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:100378:95"/>
diſcerned alſo the <hi>Hierro,</hi> being diſtant above twenty Leagues; and ſo to the utmoſt Limits of the Sea much farther.</p>
               <p>So ſoon as the Sun appeared, the Shadow of the <hi>Pico</hi> ſeemed to cover not only the whole Iſland, and the <hi>Grand Canaries,</hi> but the Sea to the very Horizon, where the Top of the Sugar-Loaf, or <hi>Pico,</hi> viſibly appeared to turn up, and caſt its Shadow into the Air it ſelf, at which they were much ſuprized. But the Sun was not far aſcended when the Clouds began to riſe ſo faſt, as intercepted their Proſpect, both of the Sea, and the whole Iſland, excepting only the Tops of the ſubjacent Mountains, which ſeemed to pierce them through.</p>
               <p>Whether theſe Clouds do ever ſurmount the <hi>Pico,</hi> they could not ſay; but to ſuch as are far beneath, they ſometimes ſeem to hang above it, or rather wrap them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves about it, as conſtantly when the North-Weſt Winds blow: This they call the Capp, and is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Prognoſtick of enſuing Storms.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>John Webber,</hi> one of this Company, who had made a Journey two Years after, arriving at the Top of the <hi>Pico</hi> before Day, and creeping under a great Stone to ſhroud himſelf from the cold Air, (after a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſpace) found himſelf all wet, and admiring whence it ſhould proceed, perceived it at laſt to come from a perpetual Trickling of the Water from the imminent Rocks above him.</p>
               <p>Many excellent and very exuberant Springs they found iſſuing from the Tops of moſt of the other Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, guſhing out in great Spouts, almoſt as far as the huge Pine-tree which was mentioned.</p>
               <p>Having ſtayed ſome time upon this Top, they all deſcended by the ſandy way, till they came to the Foot of the Sugar-Loaf, which being ſteep, even to almoſt
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:100378:95"/>
a Perpendicular, they ſoon paſſed: and here they meet a Cave of about ten Yards deep, and fifteen broad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Shape like an Oven or <hi>Cupola,</hi> having a Hole at the Top, which is near eight Yards over; by this they deſcended (an active Spaniard ſhewing them the way) by a Rope, which their Servants held at the Top, whilſt the other End being faſtened about his middle, he ſwings himſelf, till being over a Bank of Snow, he ſlides down and lights upon it. They are forced to ſwing thus in the Deſcent, becauſe in the middle of the bottom of this Cave, oppoſite to the Overture at the Top, is a round Pit of Water, reſembling a Well, the Surface whereof is about a Yard lower than the Snow, but as wide as the Mouth at the Top, and is about ſix Fathom deep, as Mr. <hi>Lambell</hi> reports, who plumbed it. They ſuppoſ this Water not a Spring, but diſſolved Snow, or Water blown in; for ſome Years it lies ſo full, one cannot get into the Cave for Water trickling through the Rocks.</p>
               <p>About the Sides of the <hi>Grotte,</hi> for ſome Height is Ice, and Icecles hanging down to the Snow: but being quickly weary of this exceſſive cold Place, and drawn up again, they continued their Deſcent from the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains by the ſame Paſſages they went up the Day before; and ſo about five in the Evening arrived to <hi>Oratava,</hi> from whence they ſet forth: their Faces ſo red and ſore, that to reduce them and cool them, they were forced to waſh and bathe them in Whites of Eggs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The whole Altitude of the <hi>Pico</hi> in Perpendicular, is vulgarly eſteemed to be two Miles and a half.</p>
               <p>No Trees, Herbs or Shrubs in all the Paſſage, but Pines; and amongſt the white Sands a kind of Broom, being a buſhy Plant; and at the Side where they lay all Night, a kind of Cardon, which has Stems of eight
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:100378:96"/>
Foot high, the Trunk near half a Foot thick, every Stem growing in four ſquares, and emerging from the Ground like Tuffets of Ruſhes; upon the Edges of theſe Stems grow very ſmall red Buttons or Berries, which being ſqueezed, produce a poiſonous Milk, which lighting upon any part of a Horſe, or other Beaſt, fetches off the Hair from the Skin immediately: Of the dead Part of this they made their Fires all Night. This Plant is alſo univerſal over the Iſland, and is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, and as I conjecture, a kind of <hi>Euphorbium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſome part of this Iſland alſo there grows a crooked Shrub, which they call <hi>Legnan-vell,</hi> which they bring for <hi>England</hi> as a ſweet Wood. There are likewiſe Apri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coks, Peaches, and in Standards, which bear twice a Year: Pear Trees alſo which are as pregnant; Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds of a tender Shell, Palms, Plantanes, Oranges and Lemons, eſpecially the Pregnadas, which have ſmall ones in their Bellies, from whence they are ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated. Alſo they have Sugar-Canes, and a little Cotton and Colloquintida; the Roſes blow at <hi>Chriſtmas;</hi> there are good Carnations, and very large, but Tulips will not grow or thrive there: Sampier clothes the Rock in abundance, and a kind of Clover the Ground. Another Graſs growing near the Sea, which is of a broader Leaf, ſo luſcious, as it will kill a Horſe that eats of it, but no other Cattel. There is alſo an Herb which they make Thread of. Eighty Ears of Wheat have been found to ſpring from one Root, but it grows not very high; the Corn of this is tranſparent and bright, like unto the pureſt yellow Amber; and one Buſhel has produced 130 in a ſeaſonable Year.</p>
               <p>The Canary-Birds (which they bring to us in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land)</hi> breed in the <hi>Barrancos</hi> of <hi>Gills,</hi> which the Water has fretted away in the Mountains, being Places very
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:100378:96"/>
cold. There are alſo Quails, Partridges larger than ours, and exceeding beautiful; great Wood-Pigeons, Turtles at Spring, Crows; and ſometimes from the Coaſts of <hi>Barbary</hi> appears the Faulcon. Bees are carried into the Mountains, where they proſper wonderfully.</p>
               <p>They have wild Goats on the Mountains, which climb to the very Top of the <hi>Pico</hi> ſometimes. Alſo Hogs, and Multitudes of Conies: Camels are brought from <hi>Lancerote,</hi> beſides other Cattel.</p>
               <p>Fiſh. The Cherna, a very large and excellent Fiſh, better taſted than any we have in <hi>England.</hi> The Mero, Dolphin, Shark, Lobſters without the great Claws, Muſſels, Periwinkles, and the Clacas, which is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely the very beſt Shell-fiſh in the World; they grow on the Rocks, five or ſix under one great Shell, through the Top whereof they peep with their Nebbs, from whence (the Shells being broken a little more open with a Stone) they draw them forth. There is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe another Fiſh like an Eel, which has ſix or ſeven Tails of a Span in length, united to one Head and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which is alſo as ſhort. Beſides theſe they have Turtles and Cabridos, which are preferable before our Trouts.</p>
               <p>The Iſland is full of Springs of pure Water, taſting like Milk; and in <hi>La Laguna</hi> (where the Water is not altogether ſo limpid and olear) they percolate it through a kind of ſpungy Stone cut in form of a Baſon.</p>
               <p>The Vines which afford thoſe excellent Wines, grow all about the Iſland, within a Mile of the Sea; ſuch as are planted farther up, are nothing eſteemed, neither will they thrive in any other Iſlands.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Guanchios,</hi> or the ancient Inhabitants, Dr. <hi>Pugh</hi> gives this full Account.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:100378:97"/>
                  <hi>September</hi> the <hi>3d.</hi> about twelve Years ſince, he took his Journey from <hi>Guimar,</hi> a Town inhabited for the moſt part by ſuch as derive themſelves from the old <hi>Guanchios,</hi> in the Company of ſome of them, to view their Caves, and the Bodies buried in them. This was a Favour they ſeldom permit to any, (having in great Veneration the Bodies of their Anceſtors, and likewiſe being moſt extreamly againſt any Moleſtation of the Dead) but he had done many ſeveral Eleemoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Cures amongſt them, (for they are generally very poor, yet the pooreſt thinks himſelf too good to marry with the beſt Spaniard) which endeared him to them exceedingly; otherwiſe it is Death for any Stranger to viſit thoſe Caves or Bodies.</p>
               <p>Theſe Bodies are ſewed up in Goat-skins, with Thongs of the ſame, with very great Curioſity, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the incomparable Exactneſs and Evenneſs of the Seams; and the Skins are made very cloſe and fit to the Bodies: moſt of theſe Bodies are entire, the Eyes cloſed, Hair on the Head, Ears, Noſe, Teeth, Lips, Beard, all perfect, only diſcoloured, and a little ſhrivled: likewiſe the <hi>Pudenda</hi> of both Sexes. He ſaw about three or four hundred in ſeveral Caves, ſome of them are ſtanding, others lie on Beds of Wood, ſo hardned by an Art they had, (which the Spaniards call <hi>Curar,</hi> to cure a Piece of Wood) which no Iron can pierce or hurt. He ſaid, that one Day being a Hunting, a Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret (which is in uſe there) having a Bell about his Neck, ran after a Coney into a Hole, where they loſt the Sound of the Bell; the Owner being afraid he ſhould loſe his Ferret, ſeeking about the Rock and Shrubs, found the Mouth of a Cave, and entring in, was ſo affrighted, that he cried out: it was at the Sight of one of theſe Bodies, very tall and large, lying with
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:100378:97"/>
his Head upon a great Stone, his Feet ſupported by a little Wall of Stone, the Body reſting on a Bed of Wood, as before was mentioned.</p>
               <p>The Fellow being now a little out of his Fright, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in, and cut off a great Piece of the Skin that lay on the Breaſt of this Body, which the Doctor ſays was more flexible and pliable than ever he felt any Kids Leather Glove, and yet ſo far from being rotten, that the Man made Uſe of it for his Flail many Years after.</p>
               <p>Theſe Bodies are very light, as if made up of Straw: and in ſome broken Limbs he obſerved the Nerves and Tendons, and alſo ſome Strings of the Veins and Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries very diſtinctly.</p>
               <p>His great Care was to enquire of theſe People, what they had amongſt them of Tradition, concerning the embalming and Preſervation of theſe Bodies? From ſome of the oldeſt of them (above a hundred and ten Years of Age) he received this Account: That they had of old one particular Tribe of Men that had this Art amongſt themſelves only, and kept it as a thing ſacred, and not to be communicated to the Vulgar; theſe mix'd not with the reſt of the Inhabitants, nor married out of their own Tribe; and were alſo their Prieſts and Miniſters of Religion: that upon the Conqueſt of the Spaniard, they were moſt of them deſtroyed, and the Art loſt with them, only they held ſome Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons yet of a few Ingredients that were made uſe of in this Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>They took Butter of Goats Milk, (ſome ſaid Hogs Greaſe was mingled with it) which they kept in the Skins for this Purpoſe; in this they boiled certain Herbs; <hi>1ſt.</hi> A ſort of wild Lavender, which grows there in great Quantities on the Rocks. <hi>2dly.</hi> An Herb called <hi>Jara,</hi> of a very gummy and glutinous Conſiſtence,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:100378:98"/>
which now grows under the Tops of the Mountains on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. <hi>3dly.</hi> A kind of a Cyclamen or Sow-Bread. <hi>4thly.</hi> Wild Sage growing plentifully in this Iſland. Theſe, with Stones bruiſed and boiled in the Butter, render'd it a perfect Balſam. This prepared, they firſt unbowelled the Corps; and in the poorer ſort, to ſave Charges, they took out the Brain behind: and theſe Poor alſo were ſewed up in Skins with the Hair on, whereas the Richer were (as was ſaid before) put up in Skins ſo ſinely and exactly dreſſed, as they remain moſt rarely pliant and gentle to this Day. After the Body was thus order'd, they had in a Readineſs a Lixi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium, made of the Bark of Pine-Trees, with which they waſhed the Body, drying in the Sun in Summer, and in Stoves in Winter; this repeating very often. Afterwards they began their Unction with the Balſam, both without and within, drying it again, as before: This they continue till the Balſam had penetrated it ſelf in the whole Habit, and the Muſcles in all Parts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared through the contracted Skin, and the Body be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came exceeding light; then they ſewed them up in the Goat-skins, as already mentioned. He was told by theſe ancient People, that they have above twenty Caves of their Kings and Great Perſons, with their whole Families, yet unknown to any but themſelves, and which they will never diſcover. Laſtly, he ſays, that Bodies are found in the Caves of the <hi>Grand Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> in Sacks, and quite conſumed, not as thoſe in <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neriff.</hi> Thus far of the Bodies and Embalming. Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently when they had no knowledg of Iron, they made their Lances of Wood, harden'd as before, ſome of which the Doctor has ſeen: he has alſo ſeen Earthen Pots ſo hard, that they cannot be broken, of theſe ſome are found in the Caves, and old <hi>Barrancos,</hi> and uſed by
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:100378:98"/>
poorer ſort of People that find them, to boil Meat in; likewiſe they did <hi>Curar</hi> Stone it ſelf, that is to ſay, a kind of Slate now called <hi>Tabona,</hi> which they firſt formed to an Edg or Point, as they had occaſion to uſe them, either as Knives, or Lancets to let Blood.</p>
               <p>Their Food was Barly roſted, and then ground with little Mills, which they made of Stones, and mix'd with Milk and Honey; this they ſtill fed on, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it on their Backs in Goat Skins.</p>
               <p>To this Day they drink no Wine, nor care for Fleſh; they are generally very lean, tall, active, and full of Courage.</p>
               <p>He himſelf has ſeen them leap from Rock to Rock, from a very prodigious Height, till they came to the bottom, ſometimes making ten Fathom deep at one Leap. The manner is thus.</p>
               <p>Firſt, they tertiate their Lance, (which is about the Bigneſs of a half-Pike) that is, they poiſe it in their Hand, then they aim the Point of it at any Piece of a Rock, upon which they intend to light, ſometimes not half a Foot broad; at their going off they clap their Feet cloſe to the Lance, and ſo carry their Bodies in the Air; the Point of the Lance firſt comes to the Place, which breaks the Force of their Fall; then they ſlide gently down by the Staff, and pitch their Feet upon the very Place they firſt deſigned, and from Rock to Rock, till they come to the bottom.</p>
               <p>Their Novices ſometimes break their Necks in Learning. He added ſeveral Stories to this Effect, of their great Activity in leaping down Rocks and Clifts, and how eight and twenty of them made an Eſcape from the Battlement of an extraordinary high Caſtle in the Iſland, when the Governour thought he had made ſure of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="184" facs="tcp:100378:99"/>
He told alſo (and the ſame was ſeriouſly confirmed by a Spaniard, and another <hi>Canary.</hi> Merchant then in the Company) that they whiſtle ſo loud, as to be heard five Miles off; and that to be in the ſame Room with them when they whiſtle, were enough to endanger breaking the Tympanum of the Ear: And added, that he being in the Company of one that whiſtled his loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, could not hear perfectly for fifteen Days after, the Noiſe was ſo great.</p>
               <p>He affirms alſo, that they throw Stones with a Force almoſt as great as that of a Bullet, and now uſe Stones in all their Fights, as they did anciently.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> told me this Day, that upon the <hi>18th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> he and his Company began their Journey to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Pike of <hi>Teneriff,</hi> ſetting out from <hi>L' Oratava,</hi> a Town ſeated on the lower Part of the Mountain, from which Town to the Sea there are three Miles of way always deſcending.</p>
               <p>He began his Journey on Sunday about 10 a Clock at Night, and travell'd till five in the Afternoon of the Monday following, reſting two Hours by the way; the Ground was continually riſing, and during this time they travelled about 10 Miles of their way upon Mules.</p>
               <p>Reſting upon Monday till 12 a Clock at Night, they reſumed their Journey, and travelled till about 9 in the Morning, at which time they arrived at the Top of the Sugar-Loaf, or higheſt Pile of the Mountain.</p>
               <p>They went up on the South Side of the Hill, on which Side there was no Snow, though on the North Side there were much. They ſtayed about two Hours on the Top of the Sugar-Loaf, and then returned to that Part of the Hill where they had lodg'd the Night before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:100378:99"/>
I ask'd Mr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> what was the Eſtimate made by the moſt knowing Perſons of the Iſland, of the Height of the Hill? and he told me, that the Guides ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted it to be one and twenty Miles high from the Town, which, as was noted before, is ſeated three Miles above the Sea. And he added, that a Sea-man with great Confidence affirming himſelf to have accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately enough meaſur'd by Obſervations made in a Ship, and to have found the Perpendicular Height of the Hill to be about ſeven Miles.</p>
               <p>I asked him alſo from what Diſtance the Top of the Sugar-Loaf could be ſeen at Sea, according to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Opinion of Sea-men? He anſwer'd, that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was wont to be reckoned threeſcore Sea-Leagues, of three Miles to a League; adding, that he himſelf had ſeen it above forty Leagues off, and yet it appeared exceeding high, and like a blewiſh Pyramide, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly a great deal higher than the Clouds. And he alſo told me, that ſometimes Men could from thence ſee the Iſland of <hi>Madera,</hi> though diſtant from it 70 Leagues; and that the great <hi>Canary,</hi> though 18 Leagues off, ſeem'd to be very near them, as if they might leap down upon it.</p>
               <p>He told me, that the higher Part of the Region of Snow was two Miles, or two Miles and a half lower than the Foot of the Sugar-Loaf; and that on the upper part of the Hill they felt no Wind.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> told me, that being at the Top of the Sugar-Loaf, drinking the King's Health, he indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſhoot off a Birding-Piece he had carried up with him, but though he ſnap'd it above twenty times, he could not make it go off; whereas when he came down into the ordinary Air, the firſt time he tried to ſhoot; it went readily off. I ask'd him whether he had taken
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:100378:100"/>
notice that the Flint ſtruck out any Sparks of Fire or no at the Top of the Hill, and whether he had mended and alter'd the Flint coming downwards? To the firſt he anſwered he did not remember, to the other that he remembred he did not.</p>
               <p>He alſo told me, that having carried up a Borracha of Sack, when they came to the Top of the Mountain, they drank divers Healths very freely, but could not find themſelves heated, or ſenſibly diſcompoſed by the Wine; whereas when they were come down into a thicker Air, they manifeſtly felt the heady Operation of the Liquor, which then made their Guide and one of their Company drunk.</p>
               <p>He deſcribed the Sugar-Loaf to be in the midſt of a barren Plain, in the upper Part of the Mountain, and to be exceeding ſteep. The Top of the Sugar-Loaf is made ſhelving inward almoſt like a Diſh. But in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Places of it there appear little Holes (regularly placed) as it were ſo many little Vents to a great Fire burning in or below the Bowels of the Mountain. He told me, that the Guide diſſwaded him from going to the middle of this ſhelving Top, affirming it to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding dangerous: but he ventur'd to thruſt the ſcow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Stick of his Gun ſomewhat deep and rudely into one of thoſe Holes, from whence there aroſe a hot Steam, which had like to have killed him, and hindred him from further Trials. He added, that the Top of the Mountain ſeem'd to be little elſe than Stones and Sulphur, and that there were great Store of Pieces of Brimſtone, which are gueſſed to be ſublimed up from the internal Parts of the Hill.</p>
               <p>Being asked, whether he was ſick or no in the Aſcent? he ſaid, that both he and all his Company, which were about a dozen Men, were ſick for three or four Hours,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:100378:100"/>
when they came into the ſubtile and piercing Air of the upper Part of the Mountain: but as they went down again, they were not ſick. And being asked what kind of Sickneſs it was they felt? he ſaid it was like Sea-ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
               <p>He told me, that the Sack they carried up with them to refreſh themſelves, ſeem'd to them at the Top of the Mountain ſo very cold, that they were not able to drink above two or three Drops at a Draught, by reaſon of the Operation of the exceſſive Cold upon their Teeth. He added upon my Inquiry, that his Feet were not more than ordinarily warm, and yet one of the two Pair of Pumps he carried up with him were burnt off his Feet by the Brimſtone.</p>
               <p>When I asked him about the Difference of Seaſons at the ſame time in the ſame Mountain, he told me, that he paſſed over one of them by Name.</p>
               <p>On the one Side of which it was exceſſively hot near the Top or Ridg, as well, though not quite ſo much, as in the lower Regions on the Side of the Mountain; but within a Mile or two on the other Side of the Ridg he found Winter-Weather, as to Cold and Stormineſs, and yet there was Snow as well on the other Side as on this.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>A Very learned Traveller affirmed to me, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving occaſion to reſide ſometimes on the <hi>Riviera</hi> or Coaſt of <hi>Genoua,</hi> he had often obſerved, that from a high Place he could both Morning and Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning clearly diſcern the Iſland of <hi>Corſica;</hi> and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo other Places in that Sea, though he could not ſee them at Noon, how fair and clear ſo ever the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was, when the Sun was in or near the Meridian.</p>
            <p>His late Majeſty K. <hi>Charles</hi> the Second, doing me one Day the Honour to diſcourſe about ſeveral Marine Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, was pleaſed among other things to acquaint me with this rare Phaenomenon. He was one Day walking upon the Beach on the Strand, not far from <hi>Dover,</hi> to injoy the freſh Air, and the Proſpect of the Sea, when caſually looking forwards to the Verge of the viſible Horizon, he was very much ſurprized to diſcover there a new Coaſt, with riſing and falling Grounds, newly, as it were, emerged out of the Ocean, in a Place where no ſuch thing had been ſeen before. The Strangeneſs of this unlook'd-for Apparition made Him ſuſpect ſomething of Illuſion offer'd to his Eyes by the Beams of the Sun that ſhone upon the Neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Objects; wherefore he rubb'd his Eyes, and the

new Scene not vaniſhing, he call'd to his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> (who was preſent when his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty was pleaſed to make me the Relation) and to ſome of the attending Courtiers that were neareſt at hand, to make them Partakers and Witneſſes of this delightful Spectacle, which after it had been gazed on a little while, did ſomewhat ſlowly diſappear, as if it had ſunk down again into the Ocean. Of the Cauſe of this rare Phaenomenon, I ventur'd to propoſe to the King this Conjecture: That the Place where it was ſeen lying the ſame way that the Coaſt of <hi>France</hi> did, and that Coaſt being but a little too far off to be diſcern'd before, it might very well happen, that either by Action of the Sun, or rather by ſubterraneal Steams, the Air in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed between the Shore and his Majeſties Eyes, was fill'd with Vapors and Exhalations that made it much more refractive than formerly; and by Help of this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervening Refraction, the French Coaſt that lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond it was raiſed, and as it were lifted up, in reference to the Sight, and ſo became viſible as long as that new Refraction laſted: And when the Steams that occaſion'd it, were either got up too high, or were by the Winds or Sun too much diſſipated or diſperſed, the Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ceaſed, together with the unuſual Refraction that cauſed it. And in favour of this Conjecture I alledg'd that familiar Experiment in which a Piece of Gold, or the like convenient Object, being put into the bottom of an empty Cup, and the Eye being ſo placed, that the Object is but juſt hid from it by the Interpoſition of the Side of the Cup, if Water be poured into the Veſſel, though neither the Eye nor the Object be at all remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet the Piece of Gold will be plainly ſeen, becauſe the Surface of the Water, which is a thicker Medium than the Air, breaking the Rays that tend from the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:100378:102"/>
Object towards the Beholder's Eye, according to the Laws of Refraction, that is from the Perpendicular they are ſo bended, that thoſe fall now into the Pupil, that if it were not for the Water, would either fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Side of the Cup, and ſo be hinder'd from paſſing forward; or elſe would fall upon the Eye-lids or Eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brows, or ſome other Part above the Pupil, and ſo would not make the Object viſible.</p>
            <p>The Duke of <hi>York</hi> was alſo pleaſed to tell me, that he was ſomewhat ſurprized, when being near the Borders of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in a Seaſon that did not promiſe much fair Weather, he ſaw one Morning the Sky very red, and thereupon ſaid, that he fear'd they ſhould have foul Weather, according to the uſual Prognoſtick of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men and Mariners: but ſome of the Scotiſh No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility that attended his Highneſs, told him, that in that Country ſuch red Mornings did not bode a foul Day, but rather promiſe a fair one; which Prediction of theirs was juſtified by the Event. Upon which occaſion I enquired of a very intelligent Scotiſh Noble-man, how far the Obſervation held in his Country? To which he anſwer'd, that with a due Limitation it was moſt commonly true; for though when the Redneſs ſeems to be very near the Ground, and appears in ſomewhat nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Streaks of an intenſe Red, it ſignifies bad Weather; yet if the Morning Redneſs appears elevated in the Air or Sky, eſpecially if the Wind be Eaſterly, it uſually foretels a fair Day.</p>

As for our Clock and Watch, notwithſtanding we ſtill kept them by the Fire-ſide in a Cheſt, wrap'd in Clothes, yet were they ſo frozen, that they could not go. My Obſervations by theſe Glaſſes, I compared with the Stars coming to the Meridian: By this means we found the Sun to riſe twenty Minutes before it ſhould; and in the Evening to remain above the Horizon twenty Minutes (or thereabouts) longer than it ſhould do: And all this by reaſon of the Refraction.

                  <hi>April.</hi> The Weather continued with this Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty until the fifteenth, at which time our Spring was harder frozen than it had been all the Year before. I had often obſerved the Difference betwixt clear Weather and miſty refractious Weather, in this manner: From a little Hill which was near adjoining to our Houſe, in the cleareſt Weather, when the Sun ſhone with all the Purity of Air that I could conceive, we could not ſee a little Iſland, which bare off us South-South-Eaſt ſome four Leagues; but if the Weather were miſty, (as aforeſaid) then we ſhould often ſee it from the loweſt Place. This little Iſland I had ſeen the laſt Year when I was on <hi>Danby-</hi>Iſland. The <hi>13th</hi> I took the Height of it inſtrumentally, ſtanding near the Sea-ſide, which I found to be 34 Minutes, the Sun being 28 Degrees high. This ſhows how great a Refraction here is.

               <p>Attending upon Sir <hi>Peter Wych,</hi> in his Journey for <hi>Warſaw</hi> the Beginning of <hi>June,</hi> 16 69/70, whilſt we lay about three Poliſh Miles from the City, attending the Preparations for his Reception there, we had very clear and extream cold Weather; and for two Days together we obſerved the Sun and two Parhelions, or three Suns, from above ten a Clock to near twelve, not the leaſt Cloud appearing in the Air, but that ſo ſerene, that we took notice of the Icy Spangles in the Air, flying about like Atoms in the Sun's Beams. This is alſo worth ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of; that whereas in ordinary froſty Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any ſmooth Iron, or other Metal, whether Heads of Sticks, Pomels of Swords, or Barrels of Guns, being brought out of the open Air into a warm Room, there will preſently, firſt a Dulneſs in the Glaſs, and then Drops of Water appear: At this time there would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately appear the Likeneſs of an hoar Froſt. Now whether the Particles of Cold be ſo ſubtile as to pierce or enter into poliſhed Metal, I will not determine; tho the Experience of wetting one Finger with his Spittle, and forthwith laying it to Iron when it freezes hard, by its immediate Adheſion, even in the Moment of touching it, would make ſome way for the Affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. That ſame Month returning back from <hi>Warſaw,</hi> I ſaw, upon my Journey, the Sun riſe with a large Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,

               <p>Asking of a Chymiſt that travelled with a famous Virtuoſo of my Acquaintance over part of the <hi>Alpes</hi> that is ſaid to be much ſubject to Thunders, divers Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions about Thunder, I had among other Anſwers, this, That he and my Friend being together at the Top of a forked Mountain, between whoſe Parts there lay a Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, that ſeem'd almoſt cover'd with a thick Cloud; and though the Weather were clear at both the Tops, he obſerved that the ſubjacent Cloud being big with Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, the Lightning appeared quite through it, and ſeem'd to lie deep in it, ſo that caſting his Eyes down upon the Cloud, he fancied that what he ſaw, was, (to uſe his own Compariſon) as if a ſhining Fiſh were moving to and fro very ſwiftly in a ſomewhat troubled Water. If I had ſeaſonably had the Relation, I had enquired of my Friend about it; but I was the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe it, becauſe I remember, that paſſing over a part of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> leſs high than that where the recited Obſervation was made, though it was very fair Weather, and a clear Sky at the Top of the Mountain where we were, yet a great way beneath us we ſaw dark Clouds, through part of which we afterwards in our Deſcent were obliged to paſs, though then (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:100378:104"/>
part of the Matter had been in the mean while diſcuſſed, I examine not) it ſeemed to us little diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from a thick Fog, which when we had paſſed thorow, we found the Weather fair and clear enough to the Foot of the Mountain.</p>
               <p>Meeting with an inquiſitive Noble-man that liv'd long at <hi>Naples,</hi> I asked him whether he had ever ſeen any of thoſe famous Apparitions that are ſaid ſometimes to ſhew themſelves in or near the <hi>Sicilian Strait,</hi> and is known by the Name (if I miſtake not) of <hi>Morgane?</hi> To this he anſwered me, that during the Spring-time, he had once the Curioſity to try whether this Tradition had ſo much Ground as was commonly believed; and that accordingly on ſeveral fair Mornings he roſe before the Sun, and look'd ſolicitouſly along the Coaſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeeing any thing that anſwered his Expectation: But not being diſcouraged by theſe Diſappointments, he one Morning perceived, as he thought, two Steeples in a Neighbouring Town where he knew there was but one; which Phaenomenon inviting him to continue his Curioſity, he choſe the firſt fair and cloudleſs Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to riſe early on; and caſting his Eyes towards the lately mentioned Town, and the Coaſt it was not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from, he was ſurprized with a delightful Proſpect of a new Town beyond the other, and incomparably greater than it, and furniſh'd, as it ſeem'd to him and a Doctor of Phyſick that accompanied him, with Walls and Towers, and Steeples and Houſes, and other things that were delightful, as well as wonderful to behold. But he anſwer'd me, that the Colours were not near ſo lively as the Figures, being for the moſt part ſomewhat dim, though adorned here and there with ſome Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: but this odd Spectacle, as it was not invariable du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the whole time it laſted, did not continue very
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:100378:105"/>
long; for when the Sun was gotten up to ſuch a Height above the Horizon as made his Beams powerful, they quickly confounded all theſe Airy Structures in a kind of Chaos, and made the fantaſtick City vaniſh.</p>
               <p>Moiſt Vapours are not the only Cauſe or Sign of the Opacity of the Air, ſince that dry blighting Eaſt Wind, which from the Effects Country People call a red Wind, makes the Air at a Diſtance ſeem blewiſh and thick. This is the Wind which theſe two Years laſt paſt, has been ſo pernicious to Apples, and indeed to all ſorts of Trees, not only to blaſt the Fruit, but the very Leaves of ſuch Trees as it met withal, juſt in the <hi>Tender</hi> (as the Woodmen call it) <hi>i. e.</hi> when they are newly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded out of the Buds. Mr. <hi>J. T.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That Air is ſometimes more clear and tranſparent, and ſometimes more dark, and, as it were, muddy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing clogg'd and opacated with terreſtrial Steams, is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man's Obſervation. But there are ſome Phaenomena that depend upon the Denſity, Diaphancity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Air, that are not ſo vulgarly taken notice of: For beſides thoſe that require Skill in the Doctrine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractions, on which therefore I ſhall not now inſiſt; there are ſome others that may be worth your notice, which I ſhall give a Taſte of.</p>
               <p>Conſidering the differing Accounts that are given by good Authors, of the number of the Fixed Stars, and comparing them with ſome Obſervations of our own, I was thereby, and upon ſome other Grounds, induced to ſuſpect that the differing and unheeded Conſtitutions of the Air might occaſion a Difference in aſſigning the Number of the Stars: which made me inquire of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Navigators and Travellers, ſome into the torrid Zone, and others into the frigid ones, what Difference
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:100378:105"/>
they found in contemplating the Stars in thoſe Climates, and in ours; and by this Inquiry, I learned that in ſome Places where the Air is very pure, Celeſtial Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons may be more happily made. And particularly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I ſuppoſed that intenſe Cold, by precipitating the darkning Vapours out of the Air, may probably make it more defecate and clear. I deſired an ingenious Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician that travelled in <hi>Muſcovy,</hi> to take notice of any thing that ſhould favour or disfavour this Conjecture. In Compliance with which Requeſt of mine he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me, that travelling one Night in a Sled in the more mediterranean Parts of <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> the Weather being extraordinary cold, he was invited to quit his Sled a little to conſider the Sky, where he ſaw ſo many Stars, and ſo much brighter than he had ever ſeen before, that he was almoſt as much ſurprized as delighted with ſo glorious a Spectacle, which he ſhewed to ſome of his Fellow-Travellers that ſhared in his Wonder.</p>
               <p>And this brought into my Mind, that remembring that the ingenious Capt. <hi>James</hi> being forc'd to winter in <hi>Charlton-</hi>Iſland, which though but of the Latitude almoſt of <hi>Cambridg,</hi> is but little, if at all, leſs cold than <hi>Nova Zembla</hi> it ſelf, I ſhould probably find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing pertinent to our preſent Subject in ſo diligent an Obſerver. I reſorted to his Voyage, where I met with theſe notable Obſervations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>January</hi> 30 and 31, there appeared in the Beginning of the Night more Stars in the Firmament than ever I had ſeen before, by two thirds. I could ſee the Cloud in <hi>Cancer</hi> full of ſmall Stars: and amongſt the <hi>Pleiades</hi> a great many ſmall Stars. About ten a Clock the Moon did riſe, and then a quarter of them was not to be ſeen. The Wind for the moſt part of this Month

               <p>The Ruſſian Emperor's Phyſician confirmed to me by word of Mouth, what he had ſome Years ſince told me in a Letter, that one Night which was exceeding cold and clear, being awakened out of his Sleep by a Shake that had like to have overturn'd his Sled, he look'd out and ſaw more Stars by far than ever he ſaw in <hi>England,</hi> or the Neighbouring Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> and particularly that he ſaw many about the 7 Stars, or the <hi>Pleiades,</hi> and divers others he had not ſeen before in ſeveral other Parts of the Sky. He farther told me, that theſe Stars ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed far more beautiful and bright than was uſual, inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that he doubts not, that if it had not been for the Snow, ſome of them would have caſt a diſcernable Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. For Confirmation, he ſaith, that the Phaenomena were not only taken notice of by him, but by others that travelled with him; and that though he often gazed at the Sky, ſince that time he never could ſee there near ſo many Stars, nor ſo bright.</p>

               <p>On the <hi>29th</hi> of the laſt Month, after I had written and ſent away my Letters, looking out of the Dutcheſſes Window to ſee what Weather it was, I ſaw towards the N E. alongſt the Horizon, it look'd as light, and juſt as if it had been Break-of-Day, (it was then about a quarter paſt eleven) and gave as great a Light; I went then into the Drawing-Room, and looking out of
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:100378:106"/>
that Window, could look more Northerly, and ſaw it was more light due N. and ſaw ſeveral Streaks of Light, like the Tail of the Blazing Star, all pointing N. and S. one of which was as long or longer than that we ſaw laſt Year, for it reached from the Horizon, and paſs'd betwen <hi>Charles</hi>'s <hi>Wain</hi> and the N. Star, and reached up juſt over our Heads. The ſmall ones ſometimes diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared: and then we ſaw others of the ſame Dimenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons appear in other Places, they were all near the great one; two of them ſeem'd as if their Light had come from the two Guards in <hi>Charles</hi>'s <hi>Wain;</hi> and when they vaniſhed, others appeared more South. I went to the other Side of the Houſe, and ſaw that the Light reached from the W. or W N W. by the N. to the E. or E N E. I did not go out, becauſe it blew very hard, and was very wet, contenting my ſelf to ſee it out of the Houſe, but ſent <hi>Geo. Man</hi> up the Hill, who ſaw the ſame, and it was ſo clear they could ſee the <hi>Frith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About the New Moon before, there was ſuch a Light as this ſeen by Lord <hi>Belcarus,</hi> as he came in the Night from St. <hi>Andrews</hi> to his Houſe, and by the Seamen of the Yacht at <hi>Leith,</hi> and by ſome here in Town: But though the Sky was not then ſo clear, there being broken Clouds, yet it gave ſuch Light, as they could read very plainly, as they told me; that began about 7, and laſted till 9. This laſt I did not ſee till after 11, and at a quarter of 12 it began to leſſen, at which time I went to Bed, and the Tails were then no more to be ſeen. Tell Dr. <hi>Flamſted</hi> of this, and know of him, whether he has ſeen or heard of ſuch kind of things.</p>

            </argument>
            <p>AS on the one ſide the Schools teach the Air to be a ſimple and elementary Body, that is, only hot and moiſt; ſo on the other Side, the Generality of Men are ſo accuſtomed to judg of things by their Senſes, that not finding the Air to be a viſible Body, they aſcribe leſs to it than even the School-men do; and what is inviſible, they think to be next Degree to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. And indeed both the one ſort of Men and the other, are wont to conſider the Air only as a Recepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, that barely harbours the viſible and palpable Bodies committed to it, or as it were depoſited in it, without acting upon them, unleſs it be perhaps a little upon the Account of its manifeſt Qualities, Heat and Moiſture. But for my part, who look upon the Air under another Notion, and think it may as well alter as receive the Bodies that lie expoſed to it; I am apt to allow it in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſome Bodies, certain other Faculties and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, among which ſome may be called Generative and Maturative, and others Corruptive; and this not only in reſpect of Animals and other Bodies of a ſlighter Texture, but even of Salts and Minerals themſelves.</p>
            <p>An obſerving Man that had ſailed to and fro between <hi>Europe</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> anſwered me, among other things, about their way of tranſporting Cheeſe; That the Cheeſe they uſed to take along were <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> of a very conſiderable Thickneſs, which they incloſed in
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:100378:108"/>
leaden Boxes fit for them, and thereby were able to preſerve them ſound till they came to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> But in caſe they were not able, or neglected to make uſe of ſuch Boxes, he ſeveral times obſerved, that cutting a Cheeſe in two, when they were any thing near the Equinoctial, that moſt part of it would be very dry and brittle, and ſeem'd as if it were ſpoil'd: Whereas the Parts about the middle were ſo fat and ſoft, as if all the unctuous Parts that were wanting in the dried Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Cheeſe had retired thither, and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Cream and Cheeſe. Which Conjecture was not contradicted by this, that if they cut ſome of them Cheeſes, when having left the Torrid Zone behind them, and had made a good Progreſs in the Temperate Zone, they found the external Portion good, and the Conſiſtence of the Cheeſe uniform enough.</p>

            <p>A Man of Letters, that divers times croſſed the Line in great <hi>Portugal Ships,</hi> anſwered me, That when they came near it and under it, he obſerved among other things, that there was a very manifeſt Change made in the Conſiſtence of their Bisket; that moſt of their Meat, and even their Salt Fiſh was much impaired, ſo that they were ſcarce able to eat it; and that their Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, who had been 23 times in the <hi>Indies,</hi> aſſured them, he obſerved when they came to the Equinoctial, that

            <p>
               <hi>MAY</hi> 16. We opened a ſmall Glaſs-Receiver ground to a Plate of Glaſs, in which there had been included for three Years and ſome Months, (though I know not how many) the half of a Lemon cut tranſverſly, together with a Mercurial Gage: The Lemon kept its Colour pretty well, and its Shape very well, ſave that at the Orifice the upper Part of the Pulp was depreſſed, ſeeming as it were dried up by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Liquor contain'd in it; which Liquor did now ſtagnate upon the Glaſs Plate. When this began to be disjoined from the upper Glaſs, there ruſh'd in, not without Noiſe, a pretty deal of external Air, which argued that the Air afforded by the included Lemon in ſo long a time, had not been near ſufficient to fill the Cavity of the Receiver. Neither the half Lemon nor the Liquor had any ill Scent, or other ſign of Putrefacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or Corruption; neither of them had the leaſt Mould, which gave me a Suſpicion, as far as it could be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon this Experiment, that ſuch a Mould as might have been expected, being (as may be gueſſed by the Microſcope) a <hi>Congeries</hi> of a very ſmall kind of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, could not any more than many greater ones, be produced without the Concurrence of the Air. The Liquor was clear enough, and without <hi>Faeces,</hi> being in Colour between brown and reddiſh. It contained an acid Taſte; and when I put a little of it upon Sirrup of
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:100378:109"/>
Violets, it turned it to a Purpliſh Colour; and which is more, being put upon ſmall Fragments (not Pouder) of red Coral, preſently began manifeſtly to corrode them, and that in the Cold.</p>

            <p>INquiring of an ingenious Swediſh Gentleman that was a great Dealer in the Metals his Country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounds with, whether the great Cold of ſharp Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in thoſe Northern Climates had not a ſenſible Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration upon Iron: I learned from him, that in the chief Copper Mine (which he had curiouſly viſited) being to draw up the Oar from an exceeding great Depth, they faſtned their Baskets, not as they uſe in other Mines, to Iron Chains, but to Ropes made of Ox or Bull-Hides; and that chiefly for this Reaſon, That during the hard Winter-Froſts that are there uſual, the Links of their Iron Chains were very ſubject to be broken by the great Cold joined to the Weight of the Oar, to the great Danger, and oftentimes the Deſtruction of the poor Workmen that were digging beneath: which In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience was avoided by imploying Leather, which the Cold could not make brittle, inſtead of Iron.</p>
            <p>Asking an ingenious Maſter of a Glaſs-Houſe, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he had not obſerved that Glaſſes, though as well neal'd as is ordinary, would ſometimes of themſelves break with a Noiſe long after; he anſwered me affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matively: adding, That particularly having one time had an occaſion to lay by for about half a Year or longer, a numerous Parcel of Glaſſes, when he came to take them out, he found that about a fourth Part of the whole Batch was frozen of themſelves; and that in moſt
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:100378:110"/>
or all of them, the Cracks proceeded from ſome ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Stone or great Grain of Sand, which yet indeed was not Sand, but ſome part of Salt that had not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a ſufficient Comminution.</p>
            <p>A learned Gentleman that is Owner of an Iron Mine, informs me, that he has a Houſe in <hi>Suffolk</hi> within 6 Miles of the Sea; and though the Houſe be but 80 Years old, yet the Iron Bars of the Window that look to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sea, are ſwelled, and (as he calls it) rotten, being brittle, and eaſy to be crumbled into Pouder. And when I asked him whether the Wind that came from the Sea to theſe Windows were not Southern, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered affirmatively. And to confirm what I was ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Operation of Sea-Salt upon Iron, he told me, that having had occaſion to cauſe many Bars of Iron to be laid in a Place upon the Neighbouring Shore, above the high-Water-mark, a great Storm chanced to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Tide ſo far as to drench thoſe Bars for ſome Hours after; which remaining in the Air, they were very much impaired, great thick Flakes being eaſy to be ſtruck off from them when they came to be ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer'd.</p>
            <p>A very experienc'd Maſon informed me, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thedral of <hi>Salisbury</hi> is made of <hi>Purbeck-</hi>Stone, which in the Air grows ſofter and ſofter, and will moulder away; and ſo will ſome <hi>Blechington-</hi>Stone, though not expoſed to wet; whereas the Stones dug up at <hi>Painſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick,</hi> within four Miles of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> being very ſoft and friable at firſt, will by lying in the Air (as he has particularly obſerved) acquire a Cruſt-hard and Glaſſy like Marble; and the oftner 'tis waſhed, the ſooner will it acquire this hard and yellowiſh Cruſt, which reaches but a very little way (ſcarce the Thickneſs of half a Crown) beneath the Surface contiguous to the Air.</p>

            <p>A Gentleman of my Acquaintance being ask'd by me about the burning of Candles in Grooves (or Sutts) that are not furniſh'd with Air-ſhafts, he told me, that the Depths I deſired to be informed of were very uncertain, and varied conſiderably, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the different Nature of the Soil, and perhaps o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Circumſtances, ſo that ſometimes a Candle would go out much ſooner, and ſometimes it would continue burning, though it were let down to the Depth of eight, ten or more Fathom. That when they come into cloſe Ground, though their Candle will burn at firſt, yet after a while working, (more eſpecially if the Stone be full of Mundick) the Duſt raiſed by their Working will make their Candles go out, ſo that they muſt leave working for a time, except they will be at the Charge of conveying down Air by Pipes.

            <p>WE took a ſmall handful of Raiſons, and having <note place="margin">Novemb.</note> put them into a Bolt-head, (not large, but half filled with Water) we drew out the Air, and then we removed the Portable and exactly cloſed Receiver, and put it on the Digeſtive Furnace, that the Warmth of that Place might promote the Fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in ſpight of the Unfavourableneſs of the Seaſon of the Year.

And though they had lain there we are ſure about three Years, and poſſibly much longer, yet there appear'd no Mouldineſs at all upon any of them: But the Surfaces of the uppermoſt Grains were ſomewhat diſcoloured, perhaps by a ſaline and confuſedly formed Effloreſcence, which having look'd upon through a Glaſs, and alſo taſted, I gueſſed to be a kind of Tartar. The like Liquor that the Grains had afforded had an acid Taſte, and would in the Cold cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rode Coral, but the Grains ſmell'd ſomewhat muſty.

            <p>AConſiderable Inſtance of the Changes that the Contact of Air is able to produce even upon ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Minerals, I gave thoſe that ſaw it by the following Experiment. We took one part of <hi>Lapis Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laminaris,</hi> and about four Parts of good Salt-peter; theſe being well pouder'd and mix'd, were put into a ſtrong Crucible, and kept in a vehement Fire ſome Hours, by which means the Matter, as we expected, was alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd: upon the thus prepared <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> we poured a convenient Quantity of fair Water, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded us a Solution that was ſomewhat muddy, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd of a deep red: this we pour'd into a wide-mouth'd Glaſs, which we ſet in a Window, that it might be the more acceſſible to freſh Air. There after a while our darkiſh red Solution turn'd quite green, and more Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanous than before; but continuing for ſome Days to keep the Glaſs in the ſame Window, (which reſpected the South) we found our green Solution to loſe its Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour by Degrees, and at laſt to be reſolv'd into a tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Liquor, and a ſubſiding Pouder, that was not at all green, but red, or like Brick-Duſt. Theſe Changes of Colour ſucceeded in more than one Parcel of our Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Solution.</p>
            <p>We took a very ſtrong Spirit of Vinegar, and boiled it a while on crude Filings of Copper, without finding that 'twas manifeſtly coloured by that Operation, nor
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:100378:118"/>
yet by letting it lie ſome Hours in the ſame Glaſs Egg wherein it had been boiled. Wherefore ſuppoſing this want of Coloration to depend upon the Air's not co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating in the beſt manner it might eaſily be made to do, we poured the Liquor and the Filings together into a broad flat Glaſs, (which we plac'd in a Window ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving) ſo that though the Filings were wet, yet but one part of them was cover'd to any Depth by the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruum.</hi> This done, we obſerved, as was expected, that the Filings expoſed to the Air, changed Colour, and became of a greeniſh Blew; whilſt thoſe that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Liquor manifeſted no Change of Colour, but kept that which belongs to Copper, till the <hi>Menſtruum</hi> evaporating by Degrees, they alſo being acceſſible to the Air, acquir'd the ſame Colour with the former Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar. <hi>Q.</hi> Whether in a longer time the Coloration would not have been made?</p>
            <p>We took ſome Filings of Copper, and divided it into two Parcels; one we put into a flat and ſhallow Glaſs with a wide Mouth, and the other into a Glaſs Viol, whoſe Neck was of the Breadth uſual to ſuch Veſſels.

Of which Trial the Event was ſuch as was expected; namely, that the Liquor in the Viol was but faintly colour'd, when that in the open Glaſs, that had a large Surface expoſed to the free Air, was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry richly tinged. And this Circumſtance is not to be forgotten, that whereas all the lower part of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was of a deep Blew almoſt like Ultra-Marine, that part which was contiguous to the Air was cover'd over with a kind of Film like thin Ice, which was of a
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:100378:119"/>
very differing Blew, exceeding like that of the finer ſort of Turcoices.</p>
            <p>We took two ſmall Parcels of Filings of Copper, and put each of them into a ſmall Piece of Paper, with the Edges turn'd upward, and then put upon each of them three Drops of good Spirit of <hi>Sal Armoniac.</hi> One of theſe Papers we left in the Window, the other we put into a ſmall Receiver, which by help of our Engine was emptied in little more than a Minute of an Hour. At the End of two Minutes, after the putting on of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, there appeared a manifeſt Blew on ſome Parts of that Paper that was left in the Window; but that which was in the exhauſted Receiver, being deprived of the Air that ſhould befriend its Operation, continued there full a quarter of an Hour or more (by a Minute Clock) without appearing to be at all colour'd: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore taking off the Receiver, we remov'd the Paper to the ſame Window where the other ſtood, and within about two Minutes it began to diſcloſe a Blewneſs, which within about two Minutes more was conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly heightned.</p>
            <p>Into a ſlender Viol, wherein we put a convenient Quantity of the Volatile or Urinous Spirit of the Lees of Wine (elſewhere by us deſcribed) which was of a yellow Colour, we let fall ſome Filings of Copper; and ſtopping the Glaſs well, we drew a Tincture, which according to Expectation was manifeſtly green, but not of the pleaſanteſt and moſt tranſparent ſort of green Liquors; then ſuffering the Viol to reſt in a Window for many Days, we obſerved that the Liquor did then but ſlowly return to a yellow Colour, which when it had acquired, without any Mixture of Greenneſs; we open'd the Viol for a very little while to let in the Air, and then ſtopp'd it well again; the admitted Air quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:100378:119"/>
began to change the Surface of the Liquor into a green Colour; which, though ſlowly, extended it ſelf downwards, till it had tinged the whole Liquor. This Colour afterwards, by long ſtanding, did by Degrees grow to a pale Yellow.</p>
            <p>The <hi>19th</hi> of <hi>Auguſt</hi> preſented me with ſome Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena that made me almoſt deſpair of reducing all thoſe of our variable Liquors to a ſettled Theory. For com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Day at about ten a Clock in the Forenoon to a Cloſet where I kept ſeveral Vials furniſh'd with this Liquor, I perceived one of them that ſtood in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, that had once almoſt quite loſt its Colour, to have re-acquired a very fair Blew, at leaſt as deep as that of the Sky in a fair Day. This Viol I the rather watch'd, becauſe I had taken notice, not without ſomewhat won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring at it, that for two Days before, inſtead of loſing, according to Cuſtom, the little Remains of Colour, that after many Days ſtanding it yet retained; the Colour began again to increaſe, though the Viol were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly kept ſtopp'd as before; and that which made this regaining of the Colour ſeem more ſtrange, was, that there ſtood juſt by it another Viol furniſhed with the Spirit, and with Filings taken out of the ſame Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, yet the Liquor of this Parcel continued colourleſs. Wherefore ſuſpecting that ſome Accident might have happened, whereby ſome little Portions of Air might have inſinuated themſelves thorow the Cork of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered Liquor, I caſt up my Eyes to another Viol that ſtood in ſo high a Place that was not eaſy to reach it, and where it had long reſted, and loſt its Colour: But upon this View I was confirmed, that the Change late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned in one of the Viols, was not from the Cork, but from ſome unobvious Cauſe: For though this upper Viol was furniſh'd with a good Glaſs Stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:100378:120"/>
yet the Liquor it contain'd was again grown Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruleous, though the Liquor of another Viol that ſtood juſt by it continued colourleſs. Wherefore to ſatisfy my ſelf further, I preſently went to a private Place, where I had in a Cavity made in the Thickneſs of a Wall ſet aſide two Viols, that ſeveral Days before had quite loſt their Colour; and my former Surprize was increaſed, when I found that one of them which was ſtopp'd with a Cork, continued colourleſs; yet the other that had a Glaſs Stopple, and ſtood juſt by it, had regain'd a fair Caeruleous Colour. Both theſe were fitted for Trial, with the ſame Spirit and Filings, and the ſame Day with the others above-mentioned; and the Heat of the Weather had ſo little Influence upon this Effect, that this Day was remarkably cold, being made ſo by a Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Wind, which made me obſerve it more ſo than I had found it for ſome time before.</p>
            <p>I muſt not forget on this occaſion, that I was invited by the foregoing Phaenomena, to look upon ſome Spirit, not Oil of Amber, that I had kept in a Viol for ſeveral Days upon Filings of Copper, and had ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the Air by unſtopping the Glaſs, and found, that though formerly the Spirit kept its native Colour better than I deſired, yet it had acquired a green Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, which whether it will loſe again by longer ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Time muſt determine.</p>

The Viol with a Glaſs Stopple, mentioned N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 945. being for divers Weeks left unſtirred in the Window where it ſtood before, I ſeveral times obſerved it to loſe and regain Colour; and though ſometimes it would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear of a more faint or a more rich Blew, yet ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo it would appear either quite or almoſt colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and perhaps in a Day or two after it would be again as blew as the Sky. And this, though I could not find that any thing in the Weather was the true Cauſe of this Change, ſince the Liquor would not only gain, but loſe Colour in colder Weather; and ſo it would alſo do in warmer: But on Michaelmas-Day I found it to have attained a deep Blew; and though ſince it has been now and then ſomewhat more dilute, yet during all the paſt Month of <hi>October,</hi> I remember not to have ſeen it any thing mere <hi>colourleſs;</hi> and this Day being the firſt of <hi>November,</hi> I found it to have reſumed a high Colour, though a Viol with a Glaſs Stopple, which had for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Weeks ſtood juſt by it, and formerly did divers times correſpond with it in its Changes, has continued all the laſt Month of a very pale Blew, without either deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning its Colour, or growing quite colourleſs.</p>

            <p>About three Months before the late great Plague be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in <hi>London,</hi> (in the Year 1665) there came to Dr. <hi>M.</hi> a Patient of his, to deſire his Advice for her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and the Doctor having inquired what ail'd him, ſhe anſwered, that his chief Diſtemper was a Swelling
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:100378:125"/>
in his Groin, and upon that occaſion added, that her Husband aſſured her of his being confident that the next Summer the Plague would be very rife in <hi>London:</hi> for which Prediction he gave this reaſon, That in the laſt great Plague he fell ſick of that Diſeaſe, and he then had a Peſtilential Tumor; ſo in two other Plagues that ſince happened, though much inferiour to that great one, each of them had a riſing in his Body to be its Fore-runner; and now having a great Tumor in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Place, he doubted not but it would be fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by a raging Peſtilence, which accordingly enſued. Having heard much Talk of ſomething of this Nature, as related by the Doctor, I inquired of him how much of it was true, and received for Anſwer the foregoing Narrative.</p>
            <p>You did not perhaps expect that the mere local Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Air ſhould be mentioned by me among the Cauſes of the Effects of its Changes: And indeed the Phaenomena I have yet met with reducible to this kind, have been but very few, notwithſtanding which I ſhall take notice, that this local Motion may in certain Caſes operate on other Bodies, either as it turns the Air into a Wind, or as the tremulous Motion of the Air is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dified into found, or as the Air is put into a vehement and diſorderly Motion by Thunder.</p>
            <p>As to the firſt of theſe 'tis evident, that upon the Vehemence or Slackneſs, and the Places whence and where the changing Wind happens to blow, there may divers Effects enſue, eſpecially in animated Bodies. And this not only as the Wind is accompanied with Cold and Hear, or Moiſture, or Drineſs, but (to reſtrain our ſelves to Inſtances more cloſely pertinent to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Purpoſe) as the Wind is <hi>flowing</hi> Air, or an <hi>Aireal Stream,</hi> for only as ſuch it may ventilate the Places
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:100378:125"/>
through which it paſſes, and by expelling the Stagnant Air, and introducing other Air, may contribute to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of thoſe Changes (eſpecially as to the Health of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimals) that we ſee to depend upon the Alteration of Air, and perhaps among the more tender ſort of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, there may be found ſome in which the Motion of the external Air, though excluded by Walls and Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, may have a conſiderable and immediate Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: For I have learned by Enquiry from ſome curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Natives of <hi>Languedoc</hi> (where I had the Curioſity to look after Silk-worms, abounding in that Province) that in caſe it happened when the Worms having eaten their fill, began to diſpoſe themſelves to work their ſilken Eggs; in caſe, I ſay, it then happened to be thundering Weather, a great part of the Worms, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the leſs vigorous, would be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>He affirmed to me, that in ſome Mines of above a thouſand Foot deep, he ſaw Horſes that had been let down by Ropes to the <hi>3d</hi> part of the Depth, that is above a hundred Yards, and that ſeveral of them died either in the letting down, or by the Change of Air; yet ſeveral of them ſurvived, and were imployed about the Engines belonging to the Mines, and ſeem'd not to have any ſenſible Inconvenience as to Reſpiration, though in the Receptacles they wrought in, they were furniſhed with Air but from the Groove through which they were let down, and by a moderately big Shaft.</p>
            <p>An ingenious Traveller that has had the Curioſity to viſit the Mines of ſeveral Countries, as <hi>Bohemia, Saxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Swedeland, &amp;c.</hi> anſwered me, that the deepeſt Mine he ſaw in <hi>Bohemia</hi> was of about 2000 of our Feet.</p>

            <p>Dr. <hi>C.</hi> chief Phyſician to the Ruſſian Emperor, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to me, that being in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> in the Winter, when the Froſt was very hard, and the Eaſt or North-Eaſt Wind blew cold, if he turned his Face toward the Wind, and walked againſt, (which at other times he was wont, and took a Delight to do) he found himſelf unable to fetch his Breath, and almoſt ſtifled, as if the Air were very thick, or rather a great Stiffneſs brought upon the Organs of Reſpiration, whereby he was una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to move them as at other times, ſo that he was fain to turn his Head from the Wind that he might be able to fetch his Breath.</p>
            <p>An obſerving Perſon being ask'd about a Tradition of Sea-men, that the Lice of Europeans die when the Ships paſs the Line: anſwered me, that he did not find it to be true, as it is wont to be delivered; but this he plainly obſerved in ſeveral of our Engliſh with whom he ſailed, that all the Lice quitted their Bodies, and got up into their Heads, whence they diſperſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves again when the Ship had left the Equator a pretty way behind it.</p>

To which his Lordſhip replied, that as to Quartan Agues it was generally taken notice of; inſomuch that when News was brought, that a Gentleman whom he named fell ſick of that Diſeaſe, amongſt them in the Country it was look'd upon as a ſtrange and remarkable thing.

            <p>A very ingenious Phyſician that travell'd much in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and viſited ſome Iſlands in the South-Sea, to which our Engliſh were not permitted to have Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, being ask'd of me ſome Queſtions about the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and Changes of the Air in thoſe Parts, related to me, that having made ſome ſtay in the fam'd Iſland of <hi>Ternate,</hi> he learned, that the Dutch (who had maſter'd the Inhabitants) did, upon a Compoſition made with the King for his Damages, cut down almoſt all the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Clove-trees that grew in that Iſland, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might keep up the high rate of that Spice, as indeed they have done. Whereupon there happened a Change in the Temperature of the Air, that gave cauſe to conclude, that the Exhalations of the Bloſſoms which (being dried) afford the Cloves, were not only very pleaſant, but very healthful too: For no long time after the Exciſion of theſe fragrant Trees, the Iſland became very unhealthful, which this Phyſician very probably imputed to the corroſive and noxious Steams, which plentifully iſſuing out from a kind of Vulcan, or ſmoaking, and ſometimes burning Hill, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praves the Air of that Iſland that is but little, but had their hurtful Effects formerly prevented by the Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick and benign Emanations of thoſe numerous Bloſſoms
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:100378:128"/>
and Trees that richly impregnated the Air, and by their volatile and oily Salts, oppoſed and hindred the Effects of the ſulphureous, and other ſharp Steams of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can. And my Relator aſſures me, that this Change of the Air's Conſtitution was ſo remarkable, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd when he was there, that whereas formerly ſick and valetudinary Perſons uſed to be ſent thither from <hi>Batavia</hi> to recover their Health by the Goodneſs of the Air (as we often ſend conſumptive Perſons into <hi>France)</hi> the Air at his being in <hi>Ternate</hi> had been for divers Years ſo unhealthful, that the Dutch were fain (from <hi>Batavia,</hi> or other more healthy Places) to ſend Men twice a Year to releive the Gariſons, and bring back the many ſick they uſually found at their Arrival in that formerly healthy Iſland.</p>
            <p>An obſerving Phyſician lately return'd from <hi>Tangier,</hi> anſwered me, that though otherwiſe it be a healthy Place, he took notice that 'twas not unuſual for new Comers to find themſelves feveriſh for many Weeks, or ſome Months after their Arrival, eſpecially if the pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing eaſterly Wind happened to reign. This, he ſays, he found in himſelf, not only by a conſtant Heat and ſome other Symptoms, but by that main one of the praeternatural Quickneſs of his Pulſe. He added, that this Diſeaſe, though very mild, held him near four Months: When the Eaſterly Winds happened to blow, on which his Feaveriſhneſs ſo depended, that he could eaſily, when he awaked in the Morning, know with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out asking whether that Wind blew or not.</p>

Then the Air was again withdrawn, and
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:100378:128"/>
the Inſects thereby brought to lie (ſome upon their Backs) as ſtark dead: in which Condition they were ſuffered to remain about five or ſix Hours; after which the Air being let in upon them, they nevertheleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſeemingly dead for many Minutes, (as we gueſſed between 15 and 30) but at length all recovered, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning nimbly up and down the Glaſs, though it were late at Night.</p>

            <p>It is, by long Obſervation and often repeated Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, found certain, that if any Foreigner lie on ſhore all Night at <hi>Johanna,</hi> they ſeldom miſs to be taken with Sickneſs there, or within a few Days after their Departure from the Iſland, and are commonly ſeized with putrid Feavers, whereof moſt die in two or three Days, though thoſe that have remained upon the Place all Day-long, for ſeveral Days together, are almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſafe, if they go on board of Ship every Night a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Mile, or a little further, from the Shore. The Iſland abounds with the greateſt Variety of Plants and Trees that can be almoſt imagined in that Circumfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and is generally exceſſive hot in the day-time, but cold after Sun-ſet. Whence it may poſſibly be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that the moſt volatile Parts of thoſe promiſcuous (and probably many of them poiſonous) Plants, exalted in the day-time by Degrees, and ſuddenly condenſed at Night, may by Inſpiration infect the Maſs of Blood much after the ſame manner as in Peſtilential Airs. The Inhabitants themſelves are very much ſubject to Feavers, (of what ſort I could not learn) for which they cut or ſcarify their Breaſt or Abdomen in ſeveral Places: but they obſerve that few live, except their Feaver terminates in a conſiderable number of Botches in divers Parts of the Body. There is one Hill there remarkable for Height, which is ſeldom or never free from thick Fogs or Clouds hovering over the Top of it, ſometimes higher, ſometimes lower, according as the Weather alters.</p>

Upon the Coaſt of <hi>Cormandell,</hi> and moſt maritime Places of the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> there are ſometimes (I think yearly) Fogs ſo thick (notwithſtanding it is then very hot) that all, or moſt Inhabitants from other Nations, and the tenderer ſort of the Natives, are neceſſitated to keep their Houſes, with the Doors and Windows faſt ſhut, there being little or no Commerce at that time.</p>
            <p>At <hi>Balaſſore</hi> in the Bay of <hi>Bengale,</hi> and in divers other Parts in that Country, there happens after great Rains, ſo great Corruption of the Air, that the ſtink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Smell is very nauſeous to the Inhabitants: which I preſume may be chiefly occaſioned by a great number of Frogs, and other Reptiles (wherewith thoſe Places abound) left upon the dry Places after the Inundation, and then putrified by the exceſſive Heat of the Sun. At this time there is great Sickneſs and Mortality a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Natives, chiefly by violent Feavers.</p>

            <p>Doctor <hi>Colins</hi> relates, that in <hi>Muſcovy</hi> their Horſes are much ſubject to a very ſcurvy Diſeaſe, whoſe Ruſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Name I have forgot, from which the Natives are wont to preſerve them, by keeping Goats in their Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: And being ask'd by me, whether he had this by Tradition, or upon his own Trial? He affirmed, that he had found it true himſelf, and that he therefore was wont to keep Goats in his own Stable.</p>
            <p>The ingenious Mr. <hi>Rycaut,</hi> Engliſh Conſul at <hi>Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> being ask'd of me, whether at <hi>Smyrna</hi> as well as at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> he obſerved that the Plague that uſes to rage in the former part of the Summer, degenerates into other Diſeaſes about the latter End of <hi>June,</hi> and beginning of <hi>July:</hi> He anſwered me, that at <hi>Smyrna</hi> the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does not hold ſo much as at <hi>Aleppo;</hi> but yet at <hi>Smyrna</hi> they generally obſerve, that about that time of the Year, though exceeding hot, that the Malignity of the Plague does notably leſſen, for it is not quite ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectious, nor near ſo generally mortal as it was in the former part of the Summer. When many Years ago I heard of this ſtrange Phaenomenon of the Peſtilence at <hi>Aleppo,</hi> I began to think whether a poſſible, though not perhaps the true Cauſe of it may not be ſuch as this: That the Peſtilential Corpuſcles that rove up and down in the Air, during the former part of the Summer, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:100378:130"/>
ſuch a Bulk or Groſſneſs to enable them to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe their pernicious Operations; but when the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther grows to be exceeding hot, that Heat of the Air becomes able to diſſipate thoſe Corpuſcles, and deprive them of that Bulk that we have ſuppoſed neceſſary to their deſtructive Efficacy. For Illuſtration of this Conjecture, we may take notice of the Smoak that iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues out of the Weik of a Candle newly blown out; for whilſt the ſooty Corpuſcles retain their Bigneſs and Texture, they are able to offend the Noſtrils very much by their Stink, and ſometimes to cauſe Convulſive Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Abortions in teeming Women; but if you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a Flame to this Smoak, it preſently diſcuſſes this fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liginous Matter, and diſſipates it into Particles of quite another Nature, which by this means are deprived of all their offenſive Smell, and ſome other ill Qualities. It may alſo be ſaid, that the great Increaſe of Heat in <hi>July,</hi> may enable the Sun-beams, by penetrating, the Earth deeper, and agitating its lower Parts ſtronger, and producing Creviſſes, and other new or formerly obſtructed Paſſages in the upper Parts of it, may elevate into the Air divers ſaline and other new Corpuſcles, which may either divide or diſſipate the Peſtilential ones, or elſe by aſſociating themſelves with them, make up new Concretions, differing from the Peſtilential Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles, in Bulk, Shape, Texture or Motion, in moſt or all of theſe, by which means the morbifick Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles being much altered, their Operations on the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Bodies they invade, may be ſo too, and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes they produce may become leſs malignant, or dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate into ſome other Diſeaſe. And if it be demanded why this does not happen elſewhere as well as at <hi>Aleppo</hi> and <hi>Smyrna?</hi> it may be anſwered, That the Concourſe of Cauſes may not be the ſame, and particularly that
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:100378:131"/>
the Soil of thoſe two Places may be peculiarly diſpoſed to emit Peſtilential Corpuſcles of ſuch a determinate Nature, with ſuch a Degree of Heat, and diſſipable by a greater, or with a more intenſe Heat, to afford alſo Exhalations capable to correct the former, as 'tis deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by good Authors, and ingenious Men have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it upon their own Obſervation, that yearly, at <hi>Grand Cairo,</hi> in the Heat of Summer the Plague ceaſes to be mortal, and almoſt to be infectious, when the <hi>Nile</hi> begins to overflow, which wonderful Change I ſhould not ſo much aſcribe to a Frigeration of the Air, that uſually accompanies the Swellings of the Waters, (ſince Peſtilences rage in much cooler Weather than can be ſuppoſed in ſo hot a Climate as that of <hi>Egypt</hi> in <hi>July)</hi> as to ſome nitrous and other corrected Exhalations that are plentifully emitted by the freſhly arriving Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>
            <p>There is an Account that has not, that I know of, been taken notice of, upon which the ſupervening <hi>Coldneſs</hi> and <hi>Heat</hi> of the <hi>Air</hi> may <hi>pro tempore</hi> very much alter the Qualities of it, in reference to the Bodies and Health of Men: For the Air being a fluid Body as well as Water, and impregnated with Salts of different kinds, ſome merely ſaline, and others aſſociated with ſulphureous and other kinds of Particles; it ſeems not improbable, that what happens in that groſſer fluid <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> impregnated with differing ſorts of Salts, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd by ſucceſſion of Heat and Cold, takes place alſo in the <hi>Air.</hi> I purpoſely tried in Water, that by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving in it convenient Quantities of two differing Salts, though whilſt the Liquor was <hi>hot,</hi> or perhaps ſo much as <hi>lukewarm,</hi> they would ſwim together undiſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhably in the Liquor, and ſo were in a Capacity to act jointly, and as the Schools ſpeak, <hi>actione communi,</hi>
               <pb n="249" facs="tcp:100378:131"/>
on divers Occaſions: yet when the Liquor was cold, and ſometimes when there was only a conſiderable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the <hi>Heat,</hi> the ſaline Particles of one kind, being not capable of being any longer ſufficiently agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by ſo faint a Degree of Heat, would convene into Grains or Criſtals; and loſing their Fluidity and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, viſibly ſeparate themſelves from the other kind of Salts, which yet continued fluid in the Water where it could now act but by its own particular Qualities, and not as formerly, <hi>actione communi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The cleareſt Inſtance I found of this Obſervation was afforded me by an Experiment made with the Solutions of Alum and Nitre; a Relation of which I find among my <hi>Adverſaria,</hi> in the following terms.</p>
            <p>Equal Parts of Alum and Nitre being diſſolv'd in the ſame Portion of fair Water; and the Liquor being in good meaſure evaporated, the Earthen Veſſel that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd it was ſet in the cold, by which means, at the bottom and the lower part of the ſides, the Alum ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to be firſt coagulated in many Octaedrical Grains, no Chryſtals of Nitre yet being viſible. Afterwards, upon a further Evaporation of the Water, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of the Veſſel from the Fire, there appear'd more Grains of Alum, but as yet no Nitre: wherefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving yet further evaporated the Liquor, at length the Nitre ſhot plentifully into fine little Chryſtals of the Shape proper to that Salt.</p>
            <p>This is the Account my Note-Book contains of this Trial, which ſeems to invite us to conjecture, that of the numerous ſorts of ſaline Corpuſcles that rove up and down in the Air, whilſt it is well heated by the Sun, or other Cauſes, ſome ſorts may by the Abſence of that Heat, or ſome ſupervening Cauſes of Coldneſs, be made to ſeparate from the others, which were thereby
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:100378:132"/>
contemperated, or perhaps enabled to co-operate to divers Purpoſes that they were not fit for alone; and to form Concretions, which though not ſingly viſible, may be too great to be kept in a State of Fluidity by the diminiſh'd Heat of the Air.</p>
