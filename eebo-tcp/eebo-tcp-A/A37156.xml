            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE
READER.</head>
            <p>WHEN I drew up this Relation, I was far
from deſigning to publiſh it: What I did was
for the particular Satisfaction of ſome. Perſons to whom
I am obliged. But ſince I have finiſhed it, a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Friends have deſir'd Copies of it, which I found both
tedious and chargeable to get written over. This is the
particular Reaſon as makes me comply with their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to have it Printed. For I declare, that 'tis with
ſome Reluctancy that I appear in publick in this caſe.
However, ſince 'tis done, I muſt needs let the Reader know,
that as I had no Deſign of having this Relation publick,
ſo firſt, this is the Reaſon that it has been ſo late
coming out, when the <hi>French</hi> by their early and active
Motions do already enter upon the following Campaign:
And beſides, this is the reaſon that I have expreſſed my
ſelf with more Freedom in the following Relation, which,
though 'tis an Argument of its being ſo much the more
impartial, yet it may be the leſs taking for it.</p>
            <p>As I am a Clergy-man, I think that there is a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
Obligation upon me to ſpeak Truth, and nothing but
what is Truth: And therefore, if there is any thing
in this Account that is not ſo, or if I have ſaid any
thing that may detract from the Reputation of any
Man or Country; or if I have done them any Injuſtice in
<pb facs="tcp:99404:4"/>
not publiſhing their Merits, I ſhall be very ready to
give both them and Truth Satisfaction as publickly as I
do them wrong. However, I think my ſelf obliged to
declare, that I have endeavoured to know the Truth;
and what I do not know of my ſelf to be ſo, I have in
that made uſe of creditable Informations from Parties
concerned.</p>
            <p>If I ſay little of Foreign Nations concerned in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance,
and which made by far the greater Number of
our Army, 'tis not out of any Principle of Partiality
to my own Countrey-men, but 'tis becauſe I cannot be
ſo well inform'd of their Actions as of our own, they
being Strangers to me.</p>
            <p>What I ſay of <hi>Grandval</hi> concerning his having killed
the <hi>Mareſ chal de Humieres</hi> Nephew, and his Adventures
in <hi>Savoy;</hi> as alſo what I ſpeak concerning the Prince of
<hi>Brabancon,</hi> and of the Elector's Deſign to take him into the
Field the laſt Campaigne, to withdraw him by this piece
of Policy from the Government of <hi>Namur,</hi> I would have
no more ſtreſs laid upon the Truth of it, but as a common
Report.</p>
            <p>If the Publick does kindly accept theſe my Endeavours,
it will oblige me to be more exact and curious the next
Campaign, if God grants me Life and Health; and I
ſhall be more early in ſatisfying my Countrey with it.
And I pray God ſo to unite the Hearts, Counſels and
Powers of our Allies, under the Conduct of our glorious
Monarch, as may anſwer his Endeavours and our Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that we may ſee the <hi>French</hi> Power reduc'd to
ſuch Limits as may procure a laſting Peace to Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>

Of the Laſt
CAMPAIGNE.</head>
            <p>HIS Majeſty endeavouring to be before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
with the <hi>French</hi> this Campaigne,
came very early over from <hi>England</hi> to
the <hi>Hague,</hi> about the beginning of <hi>April,</hi>
where having ſpent ſome time in Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
with the Miniſters of the Allies, His Majeſty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
went to <hi>Loo,</hi> to take ſome Divertiſement, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he enter'd upon the Fatigues of the enſuing Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne,
expecting till matters were in a readineſs to
take the Field; which prov'd not ſo early as (may be)
was deſign'd, both by reaſon of the foul Weather that
happen'd the latter end of <hi>April,</hi> and the beginning of
<hi>May,</hi> and of the great remoteneſs, as well as ſlow mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſome of our Confederate Forces.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:99404:5"/>
The <hi>French King,</hi> who owes his great Succeſs, chiefly,
to that quickneſs and activity wherewith he can execute
his Undertakings, and which is proper to the Nature
of his Government, began very early to move with his
Forces, threatning both <hi>Flanders</hi> with ſome conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Siege, and <hi>England</hi> with an Invaſion, to reſtore
the late King to his pretended Dominions. To this end
he cauſes moſt of his Forces to march towards <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
and to rendezvous about <hi>Mons,</hi> leaving the <hi>Rhine</hi>
entirely deſtitute of Troops, to render the Army in
<hi>Flanders</hi> the more powerful and formidable, being pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
ſecure both by the ſlowneſs of the <hi>Germans</hi> to take
the Field, and that Intereſt he had among ſome of the
Princes of the Empire, that nothing could be undertaken
upon the <hi>Rhine</hi> by the Confederates, before the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Deſigns in <hi>Flanders;</hi> to compaſs theſe vaſt
Undertakings, the <hi>French King</hi> not only drew off his
Forces from the <hi>Rhine,</hi> but likewiſe moſt of thoſe he
had in <hi>Savoy</hi> and <hi>Piedmont,</hi> leaving Monſieur <hi>Catinat</hi>
ſo weak, that he hath not been able to attempt any
thing this Campaigne, but even to ſuffer the Duke of
<hi>Savoy</hi> to enter into <hi>Dauphiné,</hi> and to leave it expos'd
to the Fury of the <hi>Germans,</hi> who have plunder'd burnt
and deſtroy'd, where-ever they have been in it.</p>
            <p>By this means the <hi>French King</hi> has not only been able
to bring a very numerous and powerful Army in <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi>
to undertake ſo conſiderable an Attempt as the
Siege of <hi>Namur,</hi> but alſo to think of reſtoring the late
King to the Throne of <hi>England;</hi> to this end he cauſes
an Army to march towards the Coaſts of <hi>Normandy,</hi>
pretending at firſt, that it was to ſecure his Coaſts from
a Deſcent, of which they ſpoke very much in <hi>England,</hi>
and for which they made ſome Preparations. This
Army conſiſted of between 16 and 20000 Men, both
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99404:5"/>
               <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Iriſh,</hi> which encamp'd at the <hi>Hogue,</hi> a little
Village by the Sea-ſide, between the Cape of <hi>Barfleur,</hi>
and the Bay of <hi>Caen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French King</hi> to cover this Invaſion, as well as to
help the tranſport of his Troops, made all poſſible dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
to ſet out his Fleet, to execute this great Deſign,
before ours and the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet cou'd be in a readineſs
to joyn; which probably might have been, if a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
Wind had not kept Vice-Admiral Count <hi>D' Eſtrees</hi>
in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> twenty one days together, with
the <hi>Toulon</hi> Fleet. The <hi>French King</hi> therefore ſeeing that
<hi>Tourville</hi> had already ſtaid ſo long for the <hi>Toulon</hi> Fleet,
that the <hi>Engliſh and Dutch</hi> were ready to joyn, order'd
Admiral Count <hi>De Tourville,</hi> to ſail with what Fleet
he had ready, and to enter the Channel, the Troops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
embark'd in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and he only expected to
tranſport them over to <hi>England;</hi> with this Order <hi>Tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>
came into the <hi>Channel</hi> with Fifty four Men of
War, making ſtrait to <hi>Normandy,</hi> to joyn the Tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips.</p>
            <p>In the mean while, every body wonder'd to ſee the
King ſo unconcerned at <hi>Loo,</hi> and his Kingdoms ſo nearly
threatned with an Invaſion; every body thought, that
His Majeſty would not be ſo ſollicitous for the Safety
of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> but that he would at leaſt go over
for <hi>England,</hi> and look after the preſervation of his own;
which (may be) was the very thing the <hi>French King</hi>
would have, and which he more deſign'd in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
than the Reſtauration of King <hi>James:</hi> for 'tis very
plain, that His Majeſty's Preſence, and his <hi>Engliſh</hi> Troops
in the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> put a great ſtop to his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings;
whereas in the other War, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
were not in the Alliance, <hi>Cambray, Valenciennes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> and
St. <hi>Omer,</hi> would be the work but of a Month's Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigne,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99404:6"/>
but now his Conqueſts cannot go on ſo faſt, in
a Country which he pretends of Right to belong to the
<hi>Dauphiné.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, tho' His Majeſty was at <hi>Loo,</hi> yet his Cares
were not from <hi>England</hi> in this dangerous Conjuncture,
but he ſent my Lord <hi>Portland</hi> (who in this Voyage was
accompany'd by his Son-in-Law, the Earl of <hi>Eſſex)</hi> over
to <hi>England,</hi> with ſome Inſtructions to the Queen, to
prevent this intended Invaſion, about which Her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
had already taken very effectual Cares, in ſetting
out our Fleet with all ſpeed, in raiſing the Militia of the
Country, and ſeizing ſuch Perſons as were moſt liable
to ſuſpicion in this matter: His Majeſty on this ſide of
the Water took the ſame care of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Fleet, and
order'd Colonel <hi>Selwyn</hi>'s, <hi>Beveridge</hi>'s and <hi>Lloyd</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
to be ſent back to <hi>England,</hi> to reinforce our
Army there; and likewiſe countermanded ſeveral Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments
of <hi>Horſe,</hi> which His Majeſty had order'd over
for <hi>Flanders.</hi> Thus by the Cares of Their Majeſties
in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> the two Fleets joyn'd time e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to oppoſe the execution of the <hi>French King</hi>'s
Deſigns upon <hi>England,</hi> and ſooner than His <hi>Moſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Majeſty</hi> expected; for not thinking that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
and <hi>Dutch</hi> could be ſo ſoon joyn'd, he order'd
Monſieur <hi>Tourville</hi> to fight, and engage with our Fleet
where-ever he met it, if they offer'd to oppoſe his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking
in <hi>England,</hi> with that Number of Men of
War he had then along with him; which he afterwards
did accordingly; and I think pretty well to the <hi>French
King</hi>'s Coſt. Things began now to look with a little
better aſpect in <hi>England,</hi> and to promiſe the <hi>French
King</hi> but little ſucceſs in his Invaſion, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Dutch</hi> Fleets being joyn'd, and being in a better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
than ever to do buſineſs, conſidering the number
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99404:6"/>
and bigneſs of our Men of War, and the Seamen
they had on Beard; whereas <hi>Tourville</hi> was in our
Channel with about Fifty Four Men of War, which
could give us but little reaſon to fear his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking.</p>
            <p>This was the Poſture of Affairs about the opening
of the Campaign, the King having left <hi>Loo,</hi> and paſs'd
by <hi>Breda,</hi> came to <hi>Duffel,</hi> where his Majeſty tarried
two or three Days, and the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>
went there to wait upon the King, and to Complement
him upon his Arrival in the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> as
well as to confer upon the preſent State of Affairs:
But the <hi>French</hi> Army growing daily in Number about
<hi>Mons,</hi> and the <hi>French King</hi> being come to head his
Army in Perſon, oblig'd the King to haſten to <hi>Bruſſels</hi>
to forward the Rendezvous of our Forces, which ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
part between <hi>Anderleck</hi> and <hi>Dilbeck,</hi> having <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derleck</hi>
upon the Left; and the other part between
<hi>Dendermonde</hi> and <hi>Ghendt,</hi> under the Command of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor
General <hi>Zuyleſteyn;</hi> and after a March or two,
they were joyn'd by Lieutenant General <hi>Mackay,</hi> who
took the Command of them.</p>
            <p>The King coming to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi>
               <note place="margin">May</note> lay one Night at his
own Houſe, <hi>(l'autel d'Orange)</hi> a Palace belonging of
old to the Counts of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> and Princes of <hi>Orange,</hi>
not far from the Court, and which his Majeſty has of
late beſtow'd upon Prince <hi>Vaudemont:</hi> The next Day
the King took his Quarters at <hi>Coukelbergh,</hi> a little
<hi>Chateau</hi> or Caſtle without <hi>Flanders Port,</hi> where his
Majeſty remained till the marching of the Army from
<hi>Bruſſels.</hi> The <hi>French</hi> at this time gave us by their
Motions equal Reaſons to ſuſpect <hi>Charleroy</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi>
as the Place before which they would ſet to
form a Siege; wherefore the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99404:7"/>
the Counts of <hi>Thian</hi> and <hi>Brouay,</hi> the firſt to <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur</hi>
to aſſiſt the Prince of <hi>Brabançon</hi> the Governour,
and the other to do the ſame thing at <hi>Charleroy</hi> with
the Governour of that Place,</p>
            <p>The Army having left <hi>Anderleck,</hi>
               <note place="margin">May 17./27.</note> march'd this day
through <hi>Bruſſels</hi> to <hi>Deegham</hi> towards <hi>Louvain,</hi> whilſt
Lieutenant General <hi>Mackay,</hi> with about 16000 <hi>Engliſh</hi>
and <hi>Dutch</hi> which had rendezvous'd about <hi>Dender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monde</hi>
and <hi>Ghendt,</hi> came up very near the Army in
order to joyn it the next March; the <hi>French</hi> at this
time leaving us but little reaſon to doubt, but that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur</hi>
was the place they intended to attack.</p>
            <p>This Day the Army march'd,<note place="margin">18./28.</note> and came pretty near
<hi>Louvain,</hi> the King taking his Quarters at <hi>Bethlehem-Abbey.</hi>
This Day we were likewiſe Joyn'd with the
Forces under the Command of Lieutenant General
<hi>Mackay,</hi> they incamping in the Line with the reſt of
the Army. His Majeſty was inform'd in this place
of a Deſign againſt his Life, which tho' it had miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried
the Year before, was again ſet on foot by the
ſame Perſons, <hi>viz.</hi> one <hi>Grandval, Levendael,</hi> and
<hi>Du Mont,</hi> of which we ſhall give an Account, when
we come to ſpeak of the Execution of <hi>Grandval</hi> at
<hi>Hall-Camp,</hi> he being the only one of the Three that
ſuffer'd the Puniſhment due to ſo villanous an Attempt.
The Second merited the King's Pardon, by his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
of the Plot to one of his Relations in <hi>Holland,</hi>
who immediately gave an Account of it to my Lord
of <hi>Athlone. Du Mont</hi> gave an Account of this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
much at the ſame time to the Duke of <hi>Zell,</hi> who
likewiſe gave Notice of it to the King, which, as it
was an Argument of his Sincerity in diſcovering of it,
and likewiſe upon the Duke of <hi>Zell</hi>'s Interceſſion, he
was alſo pardoned. The ſaid <hi>Du Mont</hi> came up af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:99404:7"/>
to the Army, to give his Evidence, upon the
Aſſurance his Highneſs of <hi>Zell</hi> gave him, of a ſafe
Conduct. This <hi>Du Mont</hi> having given <hi>Grandval</hi> the
meeting at <hi>Endhoven,</hi> not far from <hi>Bois-leduc;</hi> upon
<hi>Levendael</hi>'s Diſcovery, my Lord <hi>Athlone</hi> ſent a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
of 110 Horſe thither, who ſeized both the
Priſoners, I mean, <hi>Levendael</hi> that diſcover'd it, and
<hi>Grandval,</hi> and carried them to <hi>Boiſleduc</hi> to the Prince
of <hi>Naſſaw Sarbruck</hi> Governour of the Place. <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi>
at firſt made as if he were very ignorant of the
matter, and altogether innocent; but when the Prince
of <hi>Naſſaw Sarbruck</hi> ask'd him if he knew one <hi>Du
Mont</hi> at the Court of <hi>Zell,</hi> the other own'd the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and reply'd, That his Life was in his Majeſty's
Power.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> King having at laſt inveſted <hi>Namur,</hi>
               <note place="margin">May 22./June 1.</note>
opened the Trenches before the Town, attacking of
it with all the Vigour imaginable, and the Beſieged on
the other ſide making a ſtout Reſiſtance. This Town
is ſituated upon the <hi>Brabant</hi>-ſide of the <hi>Sambre:</hi> The
Caſtle is very ſtrongly ſeated upon the Aſcent of a
Hill, which makes a Nook of Land, caus'd by the
meeting of the <hi>Sambre</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe;</hi> looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Town, and oppoſite to the Caſtle on the
other ſide of the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> as you go up to <hi>Dinant,</hi> is a
ſmall Suburb of Old Houſes. This Garriſon was
compos'd of Ten <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>Brandenburgh</hi> Battalions,
which had been there all Winter in Quarters, beſides
ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Regiments, between which there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd,
during the Siege, ſome Diſcord, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
very much (as 'tis ſaid) to the yielding of
the Place. 'Tis very probable that the <hi>French</hi> King
deſign'd this Siege very early in the Spring, if the
foul dirty Weather that follow'd the Rigour of the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99404:8"/>
laſt Winter had not prevented it; or even in the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it ſelf, if it had not been ſo ſevere; for he had
gain'd in his Intereſt the <hi>Baron de Berſé</hi> Lietenant, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour
of the Place, a Gentleman (if I may call a
Traytor ſo) born in the <hi>Franche-Conté,</hi> and who had
been (as is reported) Forty Five Years in the King
of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Service. The Inhabitants of <hi>Namur</hi> rely'd
very much upon him; and indeed, more than the
Prince of <hi>Brabançon</hi> their Governour, whom they
ſuſpected, becauſe a great part of his Eſtate lay in the
<hi>French</hi> Conqueſts between the <hi>Sambre</hi> and the <hi>Meuſe.</hi>
This Lieutenant Governour was ſo much truſted, that
he took care of all the Magazines, Proviſions and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitions
that were in the place, and ſuch Care, that
he left them almoſt unprovided. Whether it was,
that things were ripe for the Deſign, if a kind Seaſon
had ſeconded it, or that he ſaw that he had gone ſo
far, that he could ſtay no longer in the place for
fear of being diſcovered, he took occaſion one day to
go and viſit ſome Out-poſts, and by this Pretext got
himſelf intercepted by a Party of the Garriſon of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi>
where he was carried Priſoner, to cover the Plot;
but his being ſo eaſily perſwaded to take the <hi>French</hi>
Service, does very plainly prove, that his being taken
Priſoner was but a Sham. It is ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he did very
great Service in this Siege, in directing the Attacks
where he thought they would be muſt convenient, who
knew ſo well the State of the Fortification. Upon
this Treacherous Governour's deſerting of the Place,
which gave reaſon to ſuſpect ſome Deſign, the Maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines
were immediately viſited, and found in a very
had Condition; upon which Orders were ſent to the
Governour of <hi>Maeſtricht,</hi> to ſend forthwith a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy
of all ſorts of Ammunition, as Powder, Ball,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99404:8"/>
Match, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and Seven Pieces of Canon, which was ſent
under the <hi>Eſcorte</hi> of a very ſtrong Detachment of the
Garriſons of <hi>Maeſtricht, Liege,</hi> and <hi>Huy,</hi> and Quarters
thereabouts, being commanded by Count <hi>Cerclaes</hi> of
<hi>Tilly,</hi> who ſafely got the Convoy into <hi>Namur,</hi> about
the latter end of <hi>February,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>March</hi>
laſt.</p>
            <p>But to return to our Army: Whilſt we were incamp'd
at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> with the King of
<hi>Spain</hi>'s Troops, lay incamp'd within two Miles of us,
on the way, between <hi>Louvain</hi> and <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards,
with his <hi>Bavarian</hi> Curiaſſers, made our Right
Wing of Horſe, that being ſtill the Elector's Poſt of
Command.</p>
            <p>The King,<note place="margin">May 23./June 2.</note> early in the Morning, had by an Expreſs
the happy News of our Victory at Sea, by Admiral
<hi>Ruſſel,</hi> over the Count <hi>de Tourville,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
which tho' it gave but a confus'd Relation as yet,
of the <hi>French</hi> loſs, and our advantage over them, the
Expreſs being ſent immediately after the <hi>French</hi> Fleet
began to make off; yet it was a Victory of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
that in the Evening the King caus'd all the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Artillery (which had joyn'd us but little before,
if not that very day) to be drawn upon the top of a
Hill, upon the Right of our Army, looking towards
<hi>Namur;</hi> the <hi>Dutch</hi> Artillery was likewiſe plac'd on the
ſame Hill, upon the Left of ours; and Orders were
given for the drawing out of the whole Army in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening,
to expreſs our Joy for the Victory, by the triple
Diſcharge of our Artillery and Small-ſhot, and at the
ſame time to give Notice of it to the <hi>French,</hi> who were
very buſie in proſecuting the Siege of <hi>Namur,</hi> the Wind
ſtanding very fair for that purpoſe. The whole Army
in expreſſing their Joy for this Victory, ſhew'd ſuch an
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99404:9"/>
alacrity and eagerneſs to be with the Enemy, to ſecond
this great Succeſs of our Fleet, and not to be behind-hand
with our Maritime Forces, that we had all the
reaſon in the World to expect great Matters, if they
had been ſet on the Enemy.</p>
            <p>This day we were likewiſe joyned by the <hi>Daniſh</hi>
Troops, commanded by Prince <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> conſiſting
of Eight Battalions of Foot, and a proportionable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Horſe; Col. <hi>Earl</hi>'s Regiment came in likewiſe
the ſame Day, and Orders were given out this Night,
for our marching the next Morning.</p>
            <p>We marcht from <hi>Bethlehem</hi> to <hi>Park,</hi>
               <note place="margin">24./June 3.</note> another Abbey
on the other ſide of <hi>Louvain,</hi> as you go to <hi>Namur;</hi> in
this March the Second Line mov'd through the Firſt,
becauſe we marcht upon the Right, and fronting ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
way at <hi>Park,</hi> towards the Enemy. The Second
Line by this motion remain'd in the Rear, when we
came to our ground; where we halted the next Day,
in which we were joyn'd by the <hi>Bavarian Curiaſſiers,</hi>
about 1400 ſtrong, who took their Poſt in the Right
Wing of Horſe, immediately upon the Right of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Foot-Guards. The King reſolving to uſe his
utmoſt endeavour to raiſe the Siege of <hi>Namur,</hi> gave
Orders this Day for all the heavy Baggage of the Army,
as Carts, Waggons, and Coaches, to be ſent away to
<hi>Arſchot,</hi> a Captain of every Brigade in the Army, with
a proportionable number of Men, being commanded
to guard it, and Orders were likewiſe given this Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
for the Army's marching the next day.</p>
            <p>The Army marcht to <hi>Meldert,</hi>
               <note place="margin">26./June 5.</note> making our way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> as well in order to joyn the Elector
of <hi>Brandenburgh</hi>'s Forces, and thoſe of the Biſhop of
<hi>Liege,</hi> under the Command of Baron <hi>Fleming,</hi> Velt-Mareſchal
General to his Electoral Highneſs, and of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99404:9"/>
Count <hi>Cerclaes</hi> of <hi>Tilly,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Liege</hi>'s General;
which Junction the <hi>French</hi> Army could otherwiſe have
hinder'd, if we had marcht the direct Road to <hi>Namur,</hi>
theſe Forces coming from the <hi>Paiis de Juliers,</hi> and that
of <hi>Liege,</hi> ſo that the <hi>French</hi> would have remained be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them and us: As alſo becauſe the <hi>French</hi> Army
had deſtroy'd all the firſt Forrage about <hi>Gemblours,</hi>
where they incamp'd for a conſiderable time. This
Day His Majeſty by a Second Expreſs, which came to
him upon the March, receiv'd the Particulars of our
Sea-Engagement, together with the Account of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<hi>Ruſſel</hi>'s, having burnt Thirteen Men of War at the

confirm'd to Prince <hi>Vaudemont,</hi> in ſeveral Letters

to <hi>Liſſam,</hi> where the King firſt form'd the <hi>Corps de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,</hi>
ordering in the March Twelve Squadrons, and
Six Battalions to encamp in the Rear of the Line, which
at that time cover'd His Majeſty's Quarters at <hi>Liſſam;</hi>
this <hi>Corps de Reſerve,</hi> as I have now ſaid, conſiſted of
Twelve Squadrons of Horſe and Dragoons, and Six
Battalions, <hi>viz. Churchil, Bath, Saxe Gotha</hi> Two Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions,
<hi>Frieſem,</hi> and <hi>Anhalt;</hi> this Body was then put
under the Command of Count <hi>de Lippe,</hi> the <hi>Landt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave</hi>
of <hi>Heſſe</hi>'s General, who before the opening of the
Campaigne upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> had come to offer his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to His Majeſty, as a Voluntier, who had Baron
<hi>Wartenſteben</hi> for his Lieutenant-General, and for Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier
the Prince of <hi>Anhalt.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:99404:10"/>
This Day we were joyn'd by the <hi>Brandenburg</hi> and
<hi>Liege</hi> Forces,<note place="margin">May 28./June 7.</note> about 14000 ſtrong, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
of Baron <hi>Fleming,</hi> and Count <hi>Cerclaes</hi> of <hi>Tilly;</hi>
for which reaſon the Army made a motion, to bring
them within the Line, as alſo the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces, under
his Electoral Highneſs of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> which hitherto had
made a Camp apart, marching ſtill as we did, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camping
at a ſmall diſtance upon our Right; the Army
therefore to bring theſe Forces within the Line, mov'd
towards the Left. In this motion we could perceive,
that the <hi>French</hi> Army, under the Command of Mare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchal
<hi>de Luxemburg,</hi> was marching towards the <hi>Mehaigne</hi>
as well as we, by the great Duſt it rais'd in the Air, it
being now dry and hot Weather; thus by the joyning
of theſe Forces, our Line of Battle was form'd, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
computed about Fourſcore thouſand ſtrong, the
King commanding the Main Body, the Elector of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi>
the Right Wing, and Prince <hi>Waldeck</hi> the Left;
and Orders were given for our marching the next
Day, without Quarter-Maſters, to go before and
mark out our Camp, we being then too near the
Enemy.</p>
            <p>We marcht on towards the Enemy,<note place="margin">29./June 8.</note> and about Two
of the Clock in the Afternoon, we came in ſight of
one another, the <hi>Mehaigne</hi> remaining between us; our
Left Wing, which in this March had the Van, being
ſomething more forward than the Right of the <hi>French</hi>
Army; upon our coming near the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> we im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
poſſeſs'd ourſelves of all the Poſts upon the
River, ſo far as our Lines reach'd, in order to paſs it
over, as ſoon as the Bridges could be made. But the
<hi>French</hi> on the other ſide, were poſſeſs'd of two Villages,
about a quarter of a Mile from the River, which were
ſurrounded with ſtrong Hedges and Thickets, between
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99404:10"/>
which Villages was a ſmall Plain, not half a Mile broad,
where ſeveral <hi>French</hi> Squadrons had advanc'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
coming very cloſe to the River-ſide; but we
having rais'd a Battery of Cannon on our ſide, we
ſoon diſperſed them, and oblig'd them to retreat to
their Body, which kept out of Cannon-ſhot: at the
ſame time we planted Batteries of Cannon at all thoſe
Poſts upon the River, as we had poſſeſs'd ourſelves of,
placing an Officer and a proportionable Guard at every
Poſt, by which means we were ſo far Maſters of the
River, that the <hi>French</hi> Soldiers could not come for a
drop of Water.</p>
            <p>The King, during this Camp, took his Quarter at
<hi>Villeer,</hi> otherwiſe <hi>Ville,</hi> an old rotten Village not far
from <hi>Hannuy,</hi> a decay'd Market-Town, ſurrounded
with ruinated Ramparts; in the Evening His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
gave Orders for the building of Bridges over
the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> in order to paſs it the next Day,
to attack the Enemy; the Picquet-Guard of the Army
being drawn out to cut down Trees and Timber, and
ſuch other Materials as they could find in the Woods,
Barns, or Houſes fit for that purpoſe; every Regiment
as they ſtood, firſt and ſecond in the two Lines, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to build a Bridge for to go over, that thus the
whole Army might paſs the River in a Front, and at
the ſame time.</p>
            <p>Tho' things were ſo well diſpos'd to attack the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
the next Day,<note place="margin">29./June 8.</note> yet this glorious Undertaking was
ſoon hinder'd by the great Rains that begun that very
Evening; this being St. <hi>Medard</hi>'s Day, it being an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
among the People of this Country, that when
it Rains upon this Day, it holds more or leſs for the
Forty Days following; which prov'd not altogether
falſe this Year: for whilſt we were incamp'd in this
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99404:11"/>
place, for eight Days together, it rain'd almoſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,
the Wind blowing at the ſame time very boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterouſly,
which quickly ſwell'd this little River, ſo that
though it be very deep, and pretty high Banks, yet it
ſoon overflow'd the neighbouring Meadows, ſo that as
we could not keep our Bridges over the River; ſo at
the ſame time, the ways by the exceſſive Rains, became
impracticable for our Cannon.</p>
            <p>This River <hi>Mehaigne</hi> has its Spring about <hi>Gemblours,</hi>
a Mile or ſo <hi>W. N. W.</hi> and is there but a little Brook,
as a Man may very eaſily leap over; but by the help
of ſeveral other little Brooks which fall into it, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
from that ſide of the River which lies towards
<hi>Namur,</hi> after a courſe of four or five Miles, it makes
a very deep, tho' narrow River, and at length falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> about a League higher than <hi>Huy.</hi> The
Left of our Line in this Camp, reach'd as far as <hi>Lattine,</hi>
within five Miles of <hi>Huy,</hi> which being flank'd by the
<hi>Corps de Reſerve,</hi> the General Count <hi>de Lippe</hi> had his
Quarter in this Village. From this Village, as far as
the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> the <hi>Mehaigne</hi> runs between very ſteep Hills,
which renders it impaſſable below this place, as the
<hi>Meuſe</hi> lies between <hi>Namur</hi> and <hi>Liege.</hi> The Line of our
Army extended itſelf from this Village very near ſix
Miles upon the Right, having left a Bottom empty be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
a riſing Ground, where our Troops could not
have been ſeen from the Enemies Camp; therefore to
make our Line appear the longer to the Enemy, we
left in this place an Interval in the Second Line, which
prov'd almoſt between the Body of the Army, and the
Left Wing of Horſe; by this Method, the Left of
our Line outwing'd conſiderably the Right of the
<hi>French.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:99404:11"/>
Whilſt the two Armies were thus facing one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
the <hi>Mehaigne</hi> lying between us, abundance of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerters
came daily from the Enemies Camp, ſometimes
Two or Three hundred a Day, not only Forreigners,
as <hi>Suiſſers, Germans,</hi> and <hi>Montferrins,</hi> but a great many
of their own Native Troops, all complaining of a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
want of Forrage and Proviſions in the <hi>French</hi> Camp:
for they had laid ſo long already about <hi>Namur,</hi> that
they had conſum'd moſt of the firſt Forrage; and their
Proviſions coming to them from <hi>Mons, Maubeuge,</hi> and
<hi>Philipville</hi> and <hi>Dinant,</hi> they were daily moleſted by
Parties from the Garriſon of <hi>Charleroy,</hi> ſo that they
could not come but very ſeldom, and that under the
<hi>Eſcorte</hi> of very ſtrong Convoys. We were likewiſe
told, That the Mareſchal <hi>de Luxemburg</hi> to make his
Army the greater, and in a condition to oppoſe ours,
drew out all the Troops that were in the Lines at <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,</hi>
relieving the Lines of Circumvallation and Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
from his own Army from time to time, the Left
being not far from <hi>Namur;</hi> ſo that tho' our Army was
ſo ſtrong and numerous, yet <hi>Luxemburg</hi> out-did us in
number. As for our ſide, very few Deſerters went o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
to the Enemy: whether it was, that we ſo maſter'd
and commanded the River, that they could not paſs, or
their own inclinations that kept them in their Duty; for
deſerting is a very common thing on both ſides, when
Armies are near one another.</p>
            <p>Whether it was true or not, that Proviſions were ſo
ſcarce in the <hi>French</hi> Army, however they ſoon had
plenty, by the ſurrender of the Town of <hi>Namur,</hi> which
was yielded to the <hi>French</hi> during this Storm of Rain
and windy Weather, which had hinder'd us from doing
any thing for its Relief, and before they were oblig'd
to it by any ſtreſs of their Condition; but the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99404:12"/>
Officers thinking that they could make a lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Defence in the Caſtle, if they did not harraſs their
Forces in the defence of the Town, were induced by
this Conſideration to deliver it to the <hi>French,</hi> and to
withdraw all the Garriſon in the Caſtle for its defence:
the Condition upon which the Town was ſurrender'd
to the <hi>French,</hi> was, that a kind of Neutrality ſhould
be obſerv'd between the Town and the Caſtle, whilſt
the <hi>French</hi> attack'd the letter place; that is, that the
<hi>French</hi> ſhould not annoy the Caſtle from the Town,
nor the Beſieg'd to do any prejudice to the Town from
the Caſtle. The yielding of this place prov'd at laſt
the loſs of the Caſtle; for tho' the Beſieg'd might be
in a better condition to make a vigorous defence in the
Caſtle, by yielding the Town, yet that depriv'd us e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of a poſſibility of doing any thing, in which we
could expect ſucceſs, to relieve the Caſtle; whereas
the relieving the Town was not a Work ſo difficult,
but might have been done by our Troops, who all
ſhew'd a very great eagerneſs to be with the Enemy:
for whilſt the <hi>French</hi> beſieg'd the Town, they had ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
large Lines of Circumvallation to keep, which were
likewiſe commanded by ſeveral Eminencies about the
Town, which they muſt either yield to us, if we had
attempted to raiſe the Siege, or defend with their own
Troops; which would have leſſen'd the Number of
the Enemies Army we ſhould have had to engage, and
if we had beaten, the Siege muſt have been rais'd of
courſe; ſo that by yielding of the Town, <hi>Luxemburg</hi>
had all thoſe Troops which were employ'd in the Lines
at <hi>Namur,</hi> to reinforce his Army, which now cover'd
the Siege of the Caſtle, where the <hi>French</hi> King was in
Perſon to Command, taking his Quarter at the Abbey
of <hi>Salſen,</hi> upon the <hi>Sambre.</hi> The Caſtle of <hi>Namur</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:99404:12"/>
(being built upon that Nook of Land which is made by

conſiſting of three parts within one another, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up from the meeting of the Rivers, till you come to
the Deſcent of the Hill on the other ſide, which makes
almoſt the Figure of Three Horn-works within one
another. Towards the <hi>Sambre</hi> lies an Eminency or lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Hill, which becauſe it was ſo near the Caſtle, that
it could be very prejudicial to it in caſe of a Siege,
Colonel <hi>Coehorne</hi> commanding a <hi>Dutch</hi> Regiment in
this Garriſon fortify'd it lately with a Horn-work,<note place="margin">An. 1691.</note>
which was called <hi>William's Fort,</hi> or the <hi>Coehorne,</hi> and
brought it within the Communication of the Caſtle by
a cover'd way; beyond all this, towards the <hi>Boys de

call'd the <hi>Devil</hi>'s <hi>Houſe;</hi> that ſide of the Caſtle
which lies upon the <hi>Mues</hi> being a meer Precipice, is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

            <p>Much about the ſame time Count <hi>de Lippe,</hi> the
<hi>Landtgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe</hi>'s General, and Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Baron <hi>Wartenſteben</hi> left the Command of the

upon the <hi>Rhine,</hi> the Confederates beginning now to
take the Field there, and making two ſeparate Bodies,
the one commanded by the <hi>Landtgrave of Heſſe,</hi> and
the other by the Marqueſs of <hi>Brandenburgh Barieth.</hi>
Count <hi>de Lippe</hi> having left the <hi>Corps de Reſerve,</hi> Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gadier

at the ſame time on the other ſide of the River,
halted with us, to form their Camp on that ſide of
the River. When we came both to our reſpective
Grounds, the Left of our Army, and more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
the <hi>Corps de Reſerve</hi> (which was juſt upon the
Paſs of <hi>Brancon,</hi> which it had upon the Right, ſlank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Left of our Line) was almoſt within Maſquet-Shot
of the Enemy's Right; but when they came to
pitch their Camp, they retreated conſiderably to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
a Wood that was in their Rear. His Majeſty
coming this Evening to view the Lines, found the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry
of the <hi>Corps de Reſerve</hi> too much expos'd to
the Enemies Canon, particularly Brigadier <hi>Churchill</hi>
and the Earl of <hi>Bath</hi>'s Regiments, which were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camp'd
juſt upon the very River ſide, order'd them to
decamp in the Night, and to march on the other ſide
of the <hi>Grand Cauſey,</hi> which they had juſt upon their
Left; this being a <hi>Cauſey-way</hi> that goes, as 'tis ſaid, from
<hi>Cologne,</hi> by <hi>Maeſtritcht,</hi> to <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Cambray,</hi> and ſo
to <hi>Paris:</hi> This Cauſey-way being very high in this
place, cover'd then very well the <hi>Corps de Reſerve.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> having their Camp in this place upon
a riſing Ground,<note place="margin">June 9./19.</note> making a Deſcent from their Front
towards a River, and in their Rear towards the Wood,
made a Motion one Afternoon, which made us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
they had a Deſign to March, upon which Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
were immediately given for the drawing out of
the <hi>Piquett</hi> Guard of our Army, and the whole Army
to be in readineſs to march; but we found quickly
that it was but a Faint, their Deſign being only to
retreat on the other ſide of the Riſing Ground to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the Wood, to remove their Camp out of our
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99404:13"/>
ſight, that thus they might march when they pleas'd,
without our Knowledge. They left in this Motion
Five or Six Squadrons upon their Right, facing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
our Camp, as if it had been their Rear-guard
upon this March: Whereupon my Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi>
was commanded with 10 Squadrons to paſs the River
at <hi>Brancon,</hi> and to obſerve them, being accompanied
by the Dukes of <hi>Ormond</hi> and <hi>Richmond,</hi> my Lords
<hi>Portland, Overkirk, Eſſex, Hide, Dalkeith,</hi> &amp;c. as
Voluntiers. Ours and the <hi>French</hi> Squadrons faced one
another a quarter of an hour, wheeling ſometimes
one way, and ſometimes another: But the Earl of
<hi>Atholne</hi> finding that the <hi>French</hi> Army was encamp'd
juſt on the other ſide of the Riſing Ground, did not
think it fit to charge the <hi>French</hi> Squadrons; and thus
commanded back his Ten Squadrons to our Camp;
no Act on happening in this buſineſs, except the firing
of a Carabine or two.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time as <hi>Luxembourg</hi> made this Motion,
we obſerv'd that the <hi>French</hi> were very ſilent about the
Caſtle of <hi>Namur,</hi> their Fire having ceaſed this day,
which inſpir'd us with very different Paſſions of Hope
and Fear of the Sieges being rais'd, or the Caſtle ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendred;
but we heard afterwards, that the reaſon
was, becauſe they had chang'd their Attacks upon the
<hi>Coehorne</hi> or <hi>William's Fort,</hi> (as it afterwards prov'd) in
a more ſucceſsful place.</p>
            <p>The Garriſon of <hi>Charleroy</hi> hearing that a great
Convoy of Bread, Meal, Oxon and Sutlers, went from
<hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Maubeuge</hi> to the Enemy's Army, made a
very ſtrong Detachment, which fell ſo ſucceſsfully up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Convoy, that they took moſt of the Waggons,
loaden with Wine, Meal, and other. Proviſions, and
about 150 fat Oxen, making a very conſiderable Booty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:99404:14"/>
The <hi>French</hi> Army having march'd upon the Left
towards <hi>Gemblours,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Juns 10./20.</note> their Right, which is made up of
their beſt Troops, being then not far from the Right
of our Army; and the <hi>Mehaigne</hi> being here very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
and inconſiderable, the King order'd the Infantry
of the <hi>Corps de Reſerve</hi> to interline in the Right Wing
of Horſe, under the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Command, to
re-inforce it. A day or two after we heard a very
terrible Blow at <hi>Namur,</hi> like a Clap of Thunder, and
a great Smoak riſing afterwards, gave us reaſon to fear
the blowing up of ſome of the Beſieged's Magazines.</p>
            <p>This day the Army march'd to <hi>Sombref,</hi>
               <note place="margin">June 12./22.</note> going
through the Right of that Ground, in which the <hi>French</hi>
had encamp'd the Day before, and leaving in this
March <hi>Gemblours</hi> upon the Left Flank of our Columns,
where a <hi>Brandenbourg</hi> Trooper ſhot a <hi>French</hi> Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
that <hi>Luxembourg</hi> had given to the Abbey of
this place, which, as it was an Infraction of the Rules
of War, it was reported, that his Majeſty would ſend
the Trooper to the Mareſchal of <hi>Luxembourg</hi> to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
him as he pleas'd. In this March we heard that
the <hi>French</hi> had made themſelves Maſters of the little

the next day, nothing happening extraordinary.</p>
            <p>This Day the Army march'd from <hi>Sombref</hi> to <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lé,</hi>
               <note place="margin">14./24.</note>
having <hi>Fleury</hi> upon our Right, where the Elector

<hi>Coeborne</hi> or <hi>William's Fort</hi> was yielded to the <hi>French,</hi>
               <note place="margin">12./22.</note>
by a ſpecial Capitulation, the like, may be, having
been hardly heard of before, that an Outwork ſhould
make a particular Capitulation for it ſelf, which indeed
was not very honourable, the Troops that were in it
being to go to <hi>Ghendt;</hi> but making a long turn thro'
moſt of the Frontier Garriſons, as <hi>Dinant, Philipville,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:99404:14"/>
Maubuge</hi> and <hi>Mons,</hi> as ſo many Triumphs to proclaim
the <hi>French</hi> Kings Glory. Colonel <hi>Coehorne</hi> being ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
much indiſpos'd by his continual Fateigues in the
Defence of his own Work, refus'd to Sign this Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation.
The Beſieged ſay for themſelves in this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
That the <hi>French</hi> having cut off the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
between this Fort and the Caſtle, they were
obliged to make this ſeparate Capitulation: For the
<hi>French</hi> finding all their Attacks unſucceſsful upon this
Horn-work, chang'd them upon the cover'd way, that
made the Communication between the Caſtle and the
Fort; and at length, after many Aſſaults, they lodg'd
themſelves between the Fort and the Caſtle, and forc'd
by this means the <hi>Coehorne</hi> to ſurrender.</p>
            <p>We made a conſiderable Detachment from our Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to cover our Foragers,<note place="margin">June 20./. 30.</note> who went about <hi>Treſigny</hi>
on the <hi>Sambre;</hi> and we made this Detachment ſo
much the ſtronger, that the next, in which we had
ſome other Deſigns than to cover our Foragers, ſhould
give no ſuſpicion to the Enemy. Captain <hi>Luke</hi> of
Brigadier <hi>Churchill</hi>'s Regiment, being in this Detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
had the Misfortune to be taken Priſoner; he was
poſted with a Guard upon the Wood, in which (it
ſeems) there was a <hi>French</hi> Party, who beat both the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> March, as if they had been ſome
of our own Detachments: One of their Soldiers
came, and when he was challeng'd by the Sentry, he
deſir'd in <hi>Engliſh</hi> to ſpeak with the Officer. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon
Captain <hi>Luke</hi> coming to him, he was thus drawn
in an Ambuſcade, that made him Priſoner juſt by his
Guard, and was afterwards carried to <hi>Namur.</hi>

            <p>This Evening we heard a great Firing in <hi>Luxembourg</hi>'s

               <p>Given at the King's Camp before Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur,
the 30th of June, about Noon.</p>
               <p>Thus the <hi>French</hi> King became the quiet Poſſeſſor of

the <hi>Meuſe</hi> and the <hi>Sambre,</hi> and ſecuring all that he

the <hi>French</hi> have ſettled at <hi>Fleury</hi> and <hi>Gemblours,</hi> which

indeed ſeems to be one of the greateſt Actions that the
<hi>French</hi> King hath ever done, to take this, which was
reckon'd the ſtrongeſt place in the <hi>Spaniſh Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands,</hi>
and a Man may ſay, the very Key of it; a
place which had been never taken before,<note place="margin">Vide du Maurier <hi>in the Life of</hi> Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am I.</note> unleſs we
reckon it taken when ſurpriz'd by <hi>Don John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria,</hi>
who pretending to viſit the Queen of <hi>Navarre</hi> as ſhe
paſs'd through this place, going to the Baths of <hi>Aix

                  <note place="margin">Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
                  </note> wreſted this place by ſurprize out of the
Hands of the States of the <hi>Seventeen Provinces,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the Pacification of <hi>Ghendt,</hi> and the perpetual
Edict, which renew'd the Wars of <hi>Flanders;</hi> and not
only that the <hi>French</hi> King ſhould take this Strong
Place, but in the Preſence of the beſt and fineſt Army
that the Confederates have ever had in the Field,
which, as the <hi>French</hi> deviſe upon the Medals ſtamp'd
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99404:17"/>
for this occaſion, ſerv'd only as a Witneſs of the <hi>French</hi>
King's Victories.</p>
               <p>But if we conſider the Complication of Misfortunes
that prevented our Attempts to raiſe this Siege, the
Action will not appear ſo great; as, the Deluge of
Rains that overflow'd the River <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> juſt when
we came to it; the Surrender of the Town during
thoſe Storms, which made us abſolutely uncapable of
relieving the Caſtle, without defeating <hi>Luxembourg</hi>
firſt, who, though he was more numerous before, yet
his Army encreas'd now to a far more conſiderable
Number, by the Junction of thoſe Troops, which
were employ'd in the Siege of the Town; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Beſieging and taking the Town afterwards, or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarding
our Army, the other ſide of the <hi>Sambre,</hi> in
the <hi>Defilés</hi> of the <hi>Bois de Marlagne,</hi> between the
<hi>French</hi> King and <hi>Luxembourg</hi>'s Armies; in which caſe
we muſt have beaten both, or been ruined our ſelves:
So that the Surrender of the Town may be reckon'd
the Fundamental Misfortune, which occaſion'd the
Loſs of the Caſtle, which was then in a manner in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
by its own Scituation between the <hi>Sambre</hi> and
the <hi>Meuſe,</hi> leaving but very ſhort Lines of Circumval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
for the <hi>French</hi> King to keep. Let us likewiſe
conſider the weak Defence of the Caſtle, after the
Loſs of <hi>William's Fort</hi> and the <hi>Devil's Houſe,</hi> yielding
when there was ſcarce a Breach in the firſt <hi>Envelope</hi>
of it; and therefore in almoſt as good Condition as
it was in the beginning of this War, before the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of <hi>William's Fort.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is certainly a very ſurprizing and wonderful
thing, that a place of ſuch Importance, in which, as
ſeveral <hi>Walloon</hi> Officers ſay, there was to be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
Magazine of Ammunitions and Proviſions for
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99404:18"/>
Ten Months for 8 or 9000 Men, ſhould now be
forc'd to yield, after a Fortnight or three Weeks Siege,
for want of it; and particularly, when before the
ſurrendring of the Town, 'twas in their power to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
as much Proviſions from the Town, for the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
of the Caſtle, as they thought fit themſelves.
This is too plain an Argument of a wilful Negligence;
for though there was no probability of relieving the
Caſtle, after they had ſurrendred the Town, yet we
could expect, that they would make the more vigorous
Defence for it in the Caſtle, as 'twas pretended, when
they yielded the Town to the Enemy: And neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
we find it ſurrendred, when the Body of the place
remain'd entire, hardly a Breach being made in the
outermoſt Work of the Three. The Beſieged ſay,
that their greateſt Want was Water, which the Enemy
ſpoil'd by the Directions of the Baron <hi>de Berſe</hi> to level
their Bombs to the Well. It is likewiſe reported, that
the Diſſentions between the Spaniſh and Auxiliary
Troops did not a little contribute to forward the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render
of the place.</p>
               <p>Whatever the Prince of <hi>Brabançon</hi> the Governour
might have to juſtifie his Conduct in this Siege, yet
ſince he lies under Confiement in the Cittadel of
<hi>Antwerp,</hi> till the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> be inform'd of the
matter. Yet 'tis thought, that though he were guilty,
yet being of the Houſe of <hi>Aremberg,</hi> one of the moſt
conſiderable of the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> and Ally'd with
moſt of the <hi>Grandees</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> and beſides, being
Knight of the Order of the Golden Fleece, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empts
him from all other Judicatures in Criminal Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
but that of his Knights Companions of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
with whom he hath very much Intereſt, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of his great Alliances: (I ſay) that for theſe Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99404:18"/>
'tis thought he will very ſoon be reſtor'd to his
Liberty.</p>
               <p>It hath been reported by ſome, who pretend to
underſtand the Affairs of the Court of <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> that
the King had deſir'd the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi> to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw
this Prince of <hi>Brabançon</hi> from his Government
of <hi>Namur,</hi> acquainting the Elector at the ſame time
with the Reaſons his Majeſty had to ſuſpect his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct;
and that this might be done without diſobliging
the Prince, who is ſo conſiderable both in this Country
and <hi>Spain,</hi> by reaſon of the great Alliances of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
it was agreed, That the Prince ſhould be deſir'd
to make the Campaign with the Elector. And this
went on ſo far, that the Prince was at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> in order
to accompany the Elector in the Field; but the <hi>French</hi>
threatning to ſet down before <hi>Namur</hi> before the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Campaign on our ſide, the Elector could
not refuſe his going to his Government when the Prince
deſired it, leſt he ſhould diſcover the Miſtruſt he had
of him. However, at the ſame time the Duke of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia</hi>
order'd the Count <hi>de Thian,</hi> Major-General of
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Forces, to accompany him in this Siege,
giving him ſome particular Inſtructions.</p>
               <p>We made a very ſtrong Detachment,<note place="margin">June 22./July 2.</note> which conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
of Captain, Lieutenant and Enſign, and Sixty Men
of every Battalion in the Army, which were then
about a Hundred, and a proportionable Number of
Horſe, their pretended buſineſs being to cover our Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragers
the next day; but the real, to endeavour to
ſurprize <hi>Mons,</hi> of which we had ſome Hopes, by the
Intelligence we had amongſt many of the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Inhabitants, who being ſtill <hi>Spaniards</hi> in their
Hearts, long'd to be deliver'd from the <hi>French</hi> Yoke,
and who inform'd, that the Garriſon was weak, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99404:19"/>
moſt of them <hi>Swiſſers,</hi> who would be as willing as
they to joyn in the buſineſs. Therefore as ſoon as our
Foragers were returned the next Day, Scaling-Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
Proviſions, and other neceſſary Materials were
ſent, with a Re-inforcement, to Prince <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi>
who commanded this Detachment: A Serjeant of <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel</hi>'s
Regiment, who had been in <hi>Mons</hi> when it was
beſieged, being to ſhew the way, and the Attempt to
be made upon a Breach, as the <hi>French</hi> had not repair'd
ſince they took <hi>Mons.</hi> According to theſe Directions
Prince <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> march'd the 23<hi>d</hi> all Night, and
came about One of the Clock in the Morning, the
24<hi>th,</hi> within an Hour of <hi>Mons,</hi> where having made
an Halt, he ſent for Sir <hi>Robert Douglas</hi> and Collonel
<hi>Farrel,</hi> who commanded the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to come and
ſpeak with him; but as they went back, it being very
dark, they went a little too much upon the Right, and
fell amongſt a Party of Horſe of the Garriſon of
<hi>Mons,</hi> who made them Priſoners, and carry'd them
away with all ſpeed to their Garriſon; for they confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
themſelves as much ſurpriz'd as the Priſoners them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
to be even within our Out-guards. Captain
<hi>Francis Sterling,</hi> who accompany'd Sir <hi>Robert Douglas</hi>
as a Voluntier in this Action, was of the number of
the Priſoners. The Count <hi>de Vortillac</hi> Governour of
<hi>Mons,</hi> being inform'd of our Deſign the Over-night,
had ſent out but an hour before this Detachment of
Horſe, under the Command of a Captain, to hear
News of us, he himſelf ſitting up all Night to be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
in caſe of an Attack. But Prince <hi>Wirtemberg</hi>
hearing that the Marqueſs <hi>de la Vallette</hi> was hard by
the Town, with a ſtrong Detachment of Fifty two
Squadrons of Horſe, return'd back the Twenty Fourth
to the Army.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:99404:19"/>
The <hi>French</hi> upon our March to <hi>Mellé,</hi> in caſe we
ſhould have a Deſign upon <hi>Mons,</hi> had order'd this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
to go towards it, and to receive Orders from
the Count <hi>de Vertillac</hi> Governour of <hi>Mons,</hi> when he
ſhould have occaſion for them; who accordingly, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the firſt Notice of our Deſign, ſent an Expreſs to
the Marqueſs <hi>de la Vallette,</hi> to require him to come
to his Aſſiſtance; who made no delay, but came im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately,
and arriv'd at <hi>Mons</hi> as ſoon as Sir <hi>Robert
Douglas</hi> himſelf; and the Party that made him Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
and they came to Town between Three and
Four in the Morning.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>Robert Douglas</hi> and the other two Priſoners being
come to <hi>Mons,</hi> were treated with a great deal of
Civility, the Governour coming himſelf to give them
a Viſit, and took them afterwards with him in his
Coach to Dinner, after he had given them the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
both of their Swords and the Town; but they could
not make much uſe of the latter, by reaſon they were
ſo much taken up in the Civilities of the Governour,
Intendant and Major, that they had ſcarce time to ſee
it; but yet they ſaw enough to find, that the Garriſon
was not in that caſe as had been repreſented; that there
was but two <hi>Swiſſe</hi> Companies in the place, and five
or ſix <hi>French</hi> Regiments; that it was true, that whilſt
we were upon the <hi>Mehaigne,</hi> the Garriſon had been
weak, but re-inforc'd upon our March to <hi>Mellé.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilſt we were in this Camp, ſix or ſeven days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we left it, our heavy Baggage which we had ſent
to <hi>Arſchot,</hi> from the Camp at <hi>Park,</hi> came to us under
the Convoy of a Detachment of Horſe and Dragoons,
that had been ſent for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Corps de Reſerve</hi> was order'd to march to <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nap,</hi>

to guard the Train of Artillery, which was ſent

had made the ways ſo bad, that 'twas impoſſible for

The whole Army follow'd the next day, and incamp'd
in the little Plains of <hi>Genap,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">26./6.</note> a very difficult, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſtrong Ground, by reaſon of the Woods that are
upon the Right and Left, and the <hi>Bois de Sogne</hi> in our
Rear, and the Ground itſelf very unequal, by reaſon of
the many little Hills that are in ſome places very ſteep;
as we had in this Camp the <hi>Bois de Sognes</hi> in our Rear,
ſo we had the little River <hi>Dyle</hi> in our Front, which ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſomething higher than this place, goes through
<hi>Genap,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Louvain,</hi> and <hi>Macklen,</hi> and at length
falls into the <hi>Scheld.</hi> The King had his Head-Quarter
at <hi>Genap,</hi> our Right reaching to the Caſtle of <hi>Bromel,</hi>
where the Elector had his Quarter, and was flank'd by
the <hi>Corps de Reſerve,</hi> which fac'd thus to the Duke of
<hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Quarter; the Left of the Army reaching to
<hi>Boutauneuf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the ſame time as the Army march'd from <hi>Mellé</hi>

his Ranſom, as likewiſe Col. <hi>O Farrel,</hi> and Captain

               <p>This day a Detachment was order'd of ten Regiments,<note place="margin">July 3./13.</note>
and a proportionable number of Horſe, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand

After that the <hi>French King</hi> had made himſelf Maſter

our doing any thing for its Relief, paſs'd the <hi>Sambre,</hi> not
only to conſume the Forrage there, but alſo becauſe we
lay between him and <hi>Mons,</hi> and therefore it was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
that he ſhould paſs the <hi>Sambre,</hi> to get between
<hi>Mons</hi> and us; where after he had incamp'd ſome time
at St. <hi>Gerard,</hi> and ſome other place, he repaſs'd the <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre</hi>

not far from <hi>Mons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We being to forrage this day,<note place="margin">July 10./20.</note> the <hi>French</hi> made a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
from their Army to moleſt our Forragers,
thô others ſay, that it was <hi>Boufflers,</hi> who with his <hi>Camp

<hi>Fleming;</hi> whatever it was, an advanced Detachment
of theirs, of about forty Men, falling unawares amongſt
part of our Detachment that covered the Forragers, who
thereupon were all taken Priſoners; their Deſign was
diſcover'd, and the Forragers were all immediately or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
to return home empty, moſt of them not having
yet forrag'd; and thoſe that had, had Orders to fling
down their Truſſes, to remove the quicker out of the
Enemies way: Notice being given of this to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
he immediately got on Horſeback, and order'd
the Pickquet of the whole Army to be drawn out under
Arms, and to Rendezvous at the Hermitage, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſide of the River <hi>Dyle,</hi> to be ready to ſecond our
Detachment that guarded our Forragers, in caſe they
had met with the Enemy; but nothing elſe happening,
they return'd home. The <hi>French</hi> Parties were indeed
very buſie this Camp, becauſe of the Woods that lay
particularly upon our Right, where they could come
and ſhelter themſelves, ſo that very often we had Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99404:21"/>
taken by them, grazing juſt by our very Camp;
but once we having Notice, that one of their Parties
lay in a Wood, juſt by our Right, not far from the
Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Quarters, a Detachment was made
from the <hi>Corps de Reſerve,</hi> to go and clear the Wood
of them; 'tis very probable, that they had all been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
Priſoners; for when we had diſcover'd them, and
that we came near them, they all cry'd Quarter, but
the <hi>Germans</hi> firing immediately upon them, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers'd

               <p>The Elector of <hi>Brandenburg</hi> having removed his

                  <note place="margin">July 16./26.</note> to be nearer his Forces,
te give them ſuch Orders as he thought convenient,
paſs'd the <hi>Meuſe</hi> at <hi>Roermoade,</hi> and came as far as <hi>Vrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>klen,</hi>

After the Conference, the King return'd to the Camp

               </p>
               <p>Much about the ſame time, the Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>

the way, that goes thro' the <hi>Bois de Sogne</hi> to <hi>Brſſuels,</hi>
this Wood being generally very full of <hi>French</hi> Parties,
and more particularly at this time that they expected
the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s going to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> to the Proceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the Bloody Hoſt, where the Governors of the
<hi>Spaniſh Netherlands</hi> are ſtill us'd to aſſiſt. This bloody

ſtabb'd by a Jew (as they ſay) in contempt of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,

The Elector return'd the ſame day in the Evening, after

many dangerous Ambuſcades in this <hi>Bois de Sognes,</hi> by
his quick and ſpeedy Riding.</p>
               <p>This day the Army decamp'd from <hi>Genap,</hi> and made
a great March,<note place="margin">July 21./31.</note> as far as <hi>Noſtredame de Hall,</hi> having
paſſed by <hi>Nivelle,</hi> the Abbey of <hi>Bois Seignerer Iſaac,</hi>
and a very bad Defile at <hi>Brain le Chateau,</hi> it rain'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
moſt part of this day, which made the ways very
difficult and deep, particularly for the Rear of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my:
by this long March, which laſted from Morning
till Night, we aſſur'd ourſelves of the Camp at <hi>Halle,</hi>
where otherwiſe the <hi>French</hi> might have been before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand
with us, and thus have hinder'd (by poſſeſſing
themſelves of this Paſs) the Subſiſtence of our Army in
this unforrag'd Country, and afterwards in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
We encamp'd this day our Right upon the <hi>Senne,</hi> our
<hi>Corps de Reſerve</hi> flanking it, and fronting towards <hi>Halle,</hi>
and our Left extended itſelf as far as <hi>Brain le Chateau;</hi>
we paſs'd this day through the Ground that was mark'd
for the <hi>Hanouer</hi> Troops to encamp that day, they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up in all haſt to joyn us.</p>
               <p>The next day the Army paſs'd the <hi>Senne</hi> in ſeveral
Columns,<note place="margin">22./Aug. 1.</note> one with the <hi>Corps de Reſerve</hi> going through
the Town, the others upon ſeveral Bridges of Boats,
that were laid above it; the King took his Quarters at
the Caſtle of <hi>Lembeck,</hi> and the Elector in the Town of
<hi>Halle;</hi> a place famous for the Devotions made to an
Image of our Lady, given about Four hundred Years
ſince by <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Queen of <hi>Hungary,</hi> and a Daughter
of the Houſe of <hi>Flanders;</hi> which, as the Legend of it
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99404:22"/>
pretends, hath wrought abundance of Miracles, Pictures
being hung all about the Church that repreſent them,
but none of later date than the Fifteenth Century. I
don't know whether 'tis becauſe it has not that Faculty
at preſent, or whether the Reformation has not put a
ſtop to ſeveral of their pious Cheats. This Church is
of late given and impropriated to the Jeſuites, that
have a very pretty little Colledge by it. The Town
of <hi>Halle,</hi> when we had paſs'd the <hi>Senne,</hi> and pitch'd
our Camp, remain'd in the Rear of our Right Wing
of Horſe, where the <hi>Hanover</hi> Troops afterwards
took their Poſt. In this Camp likewiſe the Infantry
of the <hi>Corps de Reſerve</hi> was commanded in the Body
of the Army, Brigadier <hi>Churchill's</hi> and the Earl of
<hi>Bath</hi>'s Regiments taking their former Poſts amongſt
the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We were likewiſe joyn'd this Day in the Afternoon
by the <hi>Hanover</hi> Troops, computed to be between 7
and 8000 ſtrong, Horſe and Foot, and all very fine and
gallant Troops, particularly the Horſe of his High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
Guard, of which there was two Troops, the
one upon Grey, and the other upon Bay Geldings,
which being very well accouter'd, and incomparably
well mounted, made a very fine and martial ſhew. His
Troop of Dragoons <hi>du Corps</hi> did almoſt equal his
Life-Guard in fineneſs and goodneſs of Equipage, and
in their Horſes. The next day we were alſo joyn'd
by two <hi>Engliſh</hi> Regiments of Horſe, namely, Colonel
<hi>Langſton</hi>'s and the Marqueſs <hi>de Ruvigny,</hi> now Lord
<hi>Gallaway;</hi> the firſt of the two was afterwards (ſome
few days after the Engagement at <hi>Steenkirk)</hi> broke in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
our other Regiments to augment their Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the Officers being remov'd according to their
Poſts, into thoſe Vacancies as were in other Regiments,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99404:23"/>
and what remain'd being allow'd Subſiſtence, till they
are provided for, the ſame way.</p>
               <p>in the Evening Orders were given out for Six Battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
to be ready to march an hour before day,<note place="margin">July 23./Aug. 2.</note> and to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade
at the Head of Prince <hi>Waldeck</hi>'s Regiment. The
Battalions were, the Second of the firſt Regiment of
Guards, the firſt of Sir <hi>Robert Douglas</hi>'s, Col. <hi>Fitz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Patrick,</hi>
Col. <hi>O Farrels,</hi> a Battalion of the <hi>Daniſh</hi>
Guards, and the Queens. Orders were likewiſe given
for Seventeen Men of each Battalion in <hi>Churchill</hi>'s Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade
to be ready at the ſame time and place, and
to be commanded by Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Manwayring,</hi>
their buſineſs being to make the ways through the
<hi>Defilés;</hi> they were all to receive a Ducat a Head for
their Labour; and as they were to joyn with the
Vanguard in time of buſineſs, they carried their Arms
with them as well as Hatchets and Spades. All this
Detachment was to be commanded by the Duke of
<hi>Wirtemberg</hi> as the Vanguard of our Army. Orders
were likewiſe given for the whole Army to march ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
early in the morning, the General to beat at break
of Day, and the Army to be ready to march at Sun
riſing. All theſe Preparations were in order to attack
the <hi>French</hi> the next day in their own Camp at <hi>Enghein,</hi>
who the ſame Day as we march'd from <hi>Gennap</hi> to <hi>Hall,</hi>
decamp'd from <hi>Soignes,</hi> and made all haſte to <hi>Enghein,</hi>
leſt we ſhould get that Ground from them, and thus
oblige them to get farther to their own Conqueſts;
<hi>Luxembourg</hi>'s Right being at <hi>Steenkirk,</hi> and his Left at
<hi>Enghien,</hi> he took his Quarters at <hi>Hove.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>According to Orders,<note place="margin">July 24./Aug. 3,</note> the Six Battalions paraded at
the Head of Prince <hi>Waldeck</hi>'s Regiment, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
of 17 Men <hi>per</hi> Battalion of <hi>Churchill</hi>'s Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade,
and received the Commandment of Prince <hi>Wir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temberg;</hi>
                  <pb n="39" facs="tcp:99404:23"/>
and very early in the Morning the whole
Army followed them, making their way to the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Camp through nothing but <hi>Defilés,</hi> being cloſe
Ground all the way, and no other way but ſuch as
was made by our Detachment for that purpoſe; the
Baggage being left behind by order, at the Camp at
<hi>Hall.</hi> About Nine or Ten in the Morning our Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
came to the Advanc'd Poſts of the Enemy,
the Mareſchal of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi> (as the <hi>Paris</hi> Account
gives it) having been informed of our Deſign by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Tracey,</hi> (who commanded a Detachment of
Horſe that Night between the Enemies Camp and
ours) had taken care to poſſeſs himſelf of the moſt
conſiderable Poſts in the <hi>Defilés;</hi> but notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Vanguard oblig'd the Enemy to retreat from
them all, till they came to a little Wood, juſt upon
the Right of the Enemies Camp, except a ſmall Guard
in a Village upon the Left of our Columns, almoſt a
League from the Enemy's Camp, who upon the March
of our Army were all made Priſoners of War; their
number about Thirty Men and an Officer.</p>
               <p>Between Ten and Eleven of the Clock in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Advanc'd Guards under the Command of
Prince of <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> lodged themſelves in the Wood
that fronted the Right of the Enemy's Army; the
<hi>Danes</hi> and the Battalion of Guards taking their Poſt
upon the Left in the Wood; and Sir <hi>Robert Douglas;
Fitzpatrick's</hi> and <hi>O Farrel</hi>'s upon the Right of them;
on the other ſide of the Wood was the Enemy's
Camp, a little Valley remaining between, and a great
many Hedges, which the Enemy reſolved to maintain
with all Vigour poſſible, though they yielded ſo eaſily
their Advanced Poſts. Prince <hi>Wirtemberg</hi> planted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a little Riſing on the Left of the Wood a Battery of
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99404:24"/>
Canon, which began to play about Eleven of the
Clock; and another upon the Right, by Sir <hi>Robert
Douglas</hi> his Battalion. Captain <hi>Macrackan</hi> of the ſame
Regiment, who afterwards was killed, pointed a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
from this Battery ſo ſucceſsfully, that it put a
whole Battalion of the Enemies in diſorder, ſweeping
almoſt an entire Rank before it.</p>
               <p>Whilſt Prince <hi>Wirtemburg</hi> was playing upon the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
with theſe Batteries of Cannon, the Army marcht
up to the Head of the Defile (about half an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile
from the Wood) where it open'd in a little Plain upon
our Right, not above half a League over, which termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
upon the Right of the Wood, where our Van-Guard
was, and at the Right of our Army, upon ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Rows of high Trees, which ſeem'd planted in great
order, as if 'twas the Avenue of ſome Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity's
Houſe, which being towards <hi>Enghien,</hi> makes me
ſuppoſe, that they may belong to the Duke of <hi>Arſchot</hi>'s
Houſe, where theſe famous Gardens be, as are ſaid to
be the Pattern of <hi>Verſailles:</hi> through theſe, ſtreight
before us, on the other ſide of the Plain, we could ſee
the <hi>French</hi> Infantry drawn up in two Lines, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
towards their Right to defend the Poſt upon the
Wood. Upon the Right of this Plain, not far from
theſe Groves and Rows of Trees, there was a pretty
conſiderab<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e Farm, which ſoon after the Engagement
was ſet on fire by the Enemy, to cover (as 'tis ſaid) ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of their Battalions by the Smoak, who were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
this way, and was afterwards engag'd with <hi>Fagel</hi>'s
Brigade, between this Houſe and the Wood, where our
Advanc'd Guard was poſted. From the Head of our
Defile, upon the Left of the Plain, there went for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
half a Mile in length, a deep hollow way with
high Trees and Hedges upon the Banks of it, which
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99404:24"/>
reach'd as far as the Wood, where the Van-Guard was
poſted, and where it branch'd itſelf in three other deep
ways, one going through the Wood upon the Left to
the <hi>Danes</hi> Attack, and to that of the Guards; one al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
ſtreight forwards; and the other upon the Right,
going along the outſide of the Wood; between theſe
two laſt was the place, where Sir <hi>Robert Douglaſs,</hi> Col.
<hi>Fitz-Patrick</hi>'s, and <hi>O Farrel</hi>'s Regiments were poſted.
On the other ſide of the deep way as went from the
Head of our Defile to the Poſt, where was our Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Guard,
went ſeveral narrow Fields, which lay between
it all along, and a part of the Wood which reach'd as
far as from our Advanc'd Guards to our Defiles.</p>
               <p>When the Army was come up to the Head of theſe
Defiles, and juſt entring into the ſmall Plains, they were
order'd to halt, except the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Life-Guards, and
Horſe and Dragoons, which were commanded upon the
right skirts of the Wood, where was our Van-Guard,
and my Lord <hi>Cutts</hi>'s, Lieutenant-General <hi>Mackay</hi>'s, Sir
<hi>Charles Graham</hi>'s, and Earl of <hi>Angus</hi>'s Regiments, which
being interlin'd with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Horſe, were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at the ſame time to the outſide of the Wood, on this
ſide of that way as branch'd upon the Right, which
made the Figure of the Arch of a Circle, as the skirts
of the Wood did here before us; theſe four Regiments
were poſted here, to be ready to ſecond the Attack of
our Van-Guard. Prince of <hi>Heſſe</hi>'s, Col. <hi>Lauder</hi>'s, and
Earl of <hi>Leven</hi>'s Regiments, who were alſo interlin'd
with the Left Wing of Horſe, were likewiſe poſted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſide of the Wood.</p>
               <p>Things being thus diſpos'd, and our Army continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the halt, Prince <hi>Wirtemberg,</hi> after he had Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonaded
for above two Hours, begun the Attack with
the <hi>Danes</hi> upon the Right, which was immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99404:25"/>
by the other four <hi>Engliſh</hi> Regiments as compos'd
our Van-Guard, and ſeconded by <hi>Cutts, Mackay, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus,
Graham, Lauder,</hi> the Prince of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> and <hi>Leven</hi>'s
Regiments. Certainly never was a more dreadful, and
at the ſame time bolder firing heard, which for the ſpace
of two Hours ſeem'd to be a continu'd Thunder, and
equall'd the Noiſe even of the loudeſt Claps; our Van-Guard
behav'd in this Engagement to ſuch wonder and
admiration, that tho' they receiv'd the Charge of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Battalions of the Enemies, one after another, yet
they made them retreat almoſt into their very Camp,
ſo far, that the Second Battalion of the Firſt Regiment
of Guards, poſſeſs'd themſelves of a Battery of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
Cannon, which the Enemy were oblig'd to quit
by the vigour of our Charge; and Colonel <hi>Wacup</hi> who
commanded the Battalion, and who behav'd himſelf
extreamly well in this occaſion, plac'd a Serjeant and
Guard upon it; but the <hi>French</hi> having cut off the
Traces, and taken away the Horſes, we could not bring
them off, but were oblig'd afterwards to leave them:
Sir <hi>Robert Douglaſs,</hi> with his firſt Battalion, charg'd ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
of the Enemies, and beat them from three ſeveral
Hedges, and had made himſelf Maſter of the fourth,
where going through a Gap to get on the other ſide,
he was unfortunately kill'd upon the ſpot; all the other
Regiments performing equal wonder, and behaving
with the ſame Bravery, and beating the Enemies from
their Hedges ſo far, that in this Hedge-fighting their
fire was generally Muzzle to Muzzle, we on the one
ſide, and the Enemy on the other.</p>
               <p>But to return to our Army; As ſoon as we were
come to the Head of the Defile, it was order'd to halt,
particularly our Left Wing of Horſe, that the Foot that
were interlin'd with them, which were moſt <hi>Engliſh</hi>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:99404:25"/>
and <hi>Scotch,</hi> and which I have before mentioned, might
march up through the Horſe; we were oblig'd to this
halt, tho' it was the loſs of the day; becauſe the Ground
was ſo ſtreight, and the Enemy had ſuch Hedges, Copſes,
and little Woods to cover them, that there was nothing to
do for the Horſe; ſo that when the Van-Guard began
to engage, they had none but part of the Infantry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terlined
with the Left Wing of Horſe, to ſecond them,
the Body of the Infantry being almoſt a Mile in the
Rear; however, as ſoon as the Action began, the King
made all diligence poſſible to get the Infantry up, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
a Brigade to march up to the Wood, and forming a
Line of Battel in the Plain, with that Infantry as could come
up; the Soldiers ſhew'd ſuch eagerneſs to come to the
Enemy, that they ran to the Relief of thoſe as were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd,
even ſo faſt, that they put themſelves into ſome
diſorder, which was the reaſon that they took more
time to form their Battalions, than was at that time
convenient: this was the caſe of thoſe Battalions as
were ſent to the Wood, to the Relief of our Van-Guard;
ſo that when they came up, our Van-Guard and Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the Left Wing being over-powr'd by the vaſt
many Battalions of the Enemy, as charg'd them ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
one after another; and laſtly, by the ſurvening
of <hi>Boufflers</hi>'s freſh Troops, they were forc'd to retreat
in great diſorder, and to leave the Wood in which they
had lodg'd themſelves, entirely to the Enemies poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
The Baron of <hi>Pibrack</hi>'s Regiment of <hi>Lunenbur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi>
being in great diſorder in the skirt of the Wood,
and the Baron their Colonel lying dangerouſly wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
upon the place, (which he got in rallying of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment)
the Earl of <hi>Bath</hi>'s (one of the Regiments that
was commanded towards the Wood) the other <hi>Engliſh</hi>
being Brigadier <hi>Churchil's)</hi> was order'd by Prince <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimir</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:99404:26"/>
of <hi>Naſſaw</hi> to their Relief; two Sergeants of this
Regiment reſcu'd the Colonel, who lay wounded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
in the Enemies hand, and brought him off in
ſpight of their fire; upon theſe Orders of Prince <hi>Caſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir</hi>
of <hi>Naſſaw,</hi> Sir <hi>Bevil Granville,</hi> who commanded
the Earl of <hi>Bath</hi>'s Regiment, march'd up to the Relief
of this <hi>Lunenburg</hi> Regiment, bearing the Enemies fire,
before he ſuffer'd any <hi>Platton</hi> of his Battalion to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
once; by which method the Regiment lodg'd
itſelf in the Trench, or deep way, that lay upon the
skirt of the Wood, which it maintain'd, till it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
off again by the ſame Prince of <hi>Naſſaw.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King having form'd a Line of as many Battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
as cou'd come up in this little Plain, the Enemy
upon their Right, and our Left of the Wood as wefac'd,
planted a Battery of about ten Pieces of Cannon, to put
them in diſorder by their fire; we at the ſame time
brought another againſt it, and thus continued firing
one upon another for a conſiderable time. What miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
we did to the Enemy by our Cannon then, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
tell, but theirs kill'd ſeveral of our Soldiers, ſome
in the Regiment of Fuzileers, and ſome in the Battalion
of the Second Regiment of Guards, but the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
loſs we ſuſtain'd by it, was Col. <hi>Hodges,</hi> who
was ſhot with a Cannon-ball at the Head of his Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
of which he ſoon after dy'd. There was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
a Skirmiſh between ſome of the <hi>French,</hi> and ſome
of our Battalions, between the Wood and that Farm
which was fir'd by the Enemy, but it did not laſt long;
what Regiments they were I cannot tell; but I ſuppoſe
they were ſome of the <hi>Dutch</hi> interlin'd in the Left Wing
of Horſe, commanded by Brigadier <hi>Fagel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Van Guard being thus diſorder'd for want of a
timely Relief, which was occaſion'd by the narrowneſs
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99404:26"/>
of the Ground, and conſequently beaten out of their
Poſt in the Wood, <hi>Luxemburg</hi> being likewiſe joyn'd by
the Marqueſs of <hi>Boufflers</hi>'s freſh Troops, who came time
enough to compleat the Defeat of our Van-Guard with
his Dragoons; and beſides, the Night drawing on, the
King order'd the Army to retreat, which was done with
admirable Order; for tho' the <hi>French</hi> did follow us for
ſome time, yet they did not fire a ſhot, ſuch was the
order of our Retreat, that they did not dare venture up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it; the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Grenadiers brought up the Rear,
and whenever the <hi>French</hi> mov'd towards us, they fac'd
to the Right about, and preſented themſelves to the
Enemy; then the Enemy would halt, and ſo our Rear-Guard
then march'd on; this halting and facing, and
then marching, continu'd for ſome time, till the Night
put an end to the Enemies farther motion: And thus
the Army came back to <hi>Halle,</hi> on <hi>Munday</hi> Morning
about Three of the Clock.</p>
               <p>We loſt in this Action ſeveral Pieces of Cannon, ſome
taken by the Enemy, and ſome we could not bring off,
the Horſes being tired, we likewiſe blew up ſome of our
Powder-Waggons in the Retreat, which we could not
bring off, ſome having their Carriages broken, and others
their Horſes tir'd. The <hi>Engliſh</hi> loſt two Colours and the
<hi>Dutch</hi> likewiſe ſome; we had about Two thouſand
Men kill'd, and about Three thouſand wounded, in
which number we comprehend the Priſoners taken by
the <hi>French,</hi> diſabled by their Wounds to come off, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
about 8 or 900. Of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> twelve
Battalions engag'd, <hi>viz.</hi> The Second Battalion of the
Firſt Regiment of Guards, the Firſt Battalion of Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Douglaſs's,</hi> Col. <hi>Fitz-Patricks,</hi> and Col. <hi>O Farrel</hi>'s

Of the <hi>Danes,</hi> Battalion of Guards, the Queen's Batta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,

who had been two or three years in Priſon in <hi>France,</hi>
and came upon his Liberty to ſerve the King as a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntier;

killed, wounded, and ſome Priſoners, whoſe Names I

General <hi>Tetteau</hi> wounded, Colonel <hi>Goz,</hi> Commandant
of Prince <hi>Caſimir</hi> of <hi>Naſſaws</hi> Guards, and Colonel
<hi>Moor</hi> Commandant of <hi>Torſey</hi>'s Regiment, both
killed.</p>
               <p>This is an Impartial Account of the Buſineſs of that
Day, of which the <hi>French,</hi> notwithſtanding their <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Deum,</hi>
have no great reaſon to brag. All as Impartial
Men can ſay of their Advantage, is, that we attack'd
them in their own Camp, and that they repuls'd us,
though with the greater Loſs both of Soldiers and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
Officers on their ſide. If it had pleaſed God
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99404:27"/>
to have given us the Victory, we muſt have been Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
of their Camp, and great part of their Baggage;
whereas the Conſequence of the Diſadvantage on our
ſide, was not, nor could not be ſo: And therefore
what ever Honour the <hi>French</hi> may aſſume to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in the Repulſe, yet it can't be deny'd us in the
Attack. And indeed the <hi>French</hi> Officers (whatever
the <hi>Paris</hi> Gazette may romance) are juſt in this reſpect,
and are not unwilling to give the Honour due to the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the reſt of the Kings Forces who engag'd
in this Attempt. What Loſs the <hi>French</hi> ſuſtain'd, or
what Forces engag'd, we cannot ſo juſt tell; the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis</hi>
Gazette ſays, That the whole Body of our Infantry
engag'd, and inſinuates, That the <hi>French</hi> Infantry did
the ſame, ſince it ſays, that it gave that day very
good Proofs of Courage, though they were not before
valued by their Enemies. Whether our whole Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
engag'd, as the Account publiſhed at <hi>Paris</hi> as ſent
to the <hi>French</hi> King, I leave the Reader to judge. I
am ſure none of the Body of Foot engag'd, but three
of the Four <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Regiments, detach'd
upon the Vanguard, and the Earl of <hi>Bath</hi>'s Regiment,
all the reſt being interlin'd with the Left Wing of Horſe,
except the Four <hi>Daniſh</hi> Battalions. But by all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formations
that I could get, from Officers who were
taken Priſoners, and who have been ſome time in
their Hands both at <hi>Mons</hi> and <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> who relate
nothing but what they have had from <hi>French</hi> Officers,
above Fifty of their Battalions charg'd that day beſides
Seven or Eight Regiments of Dragoons. Nay, their
Infantry was ſo harraſs'd by our Fire, that they ſeem'd
unwilling at laſt to come to the Charge; ſo far, that
the moſt conſiderable Princes in the Army of the
Blood, and others, were oblig'd to head them, and to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:99404:28"/>
lead them on by their Examples and Exhortations; in
which Action the Duke of <hi>Chartres</hi> receiv'd a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuſion
in the Shoulder, the Prince of <hi>Conti</hi> had two
Horſes ſhot under him, and the Prince of <hi>Turenne</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
a Mortal Wound, of which he dy'd afterwards
at <hi>Enghien.</hi> But the coming of <hi>Boufflers</hi> renewed
their Efforts, and his freſh Troops ſoon put our Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard
in Diſorder, who had been ſufficiently harraſs'd
for want of Relief. The <hi>French</hi> loſt on their ſide a
Standard belonging to the <hi>Dauphin</hi>'s Dragoons, taken
by thoſe of <hi>Epinger;</hi> and we made ſome Captains, a
Cornet, and ſome other Officers Priſoners. They have
owned themſelves to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Officers that have
been Priſoners amongſt them, that they have had
9000 Men killed and wounded: Of the wounded a
vaſt many dy'd afterwards, becauſe our Arms are
ſtronger, and carry better Balls than theirs. I can't
give an Account of their conſiderable Officers that
they loſt, ſince I have not ſeen a Liſt: What I can
remember of the <hi>Paris</hi> Gazette, are, the Prince of <hi>Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi>
the Marqueſs <hi>Tilladet,</hi> both Lieutenant Generals
kill'd, and likewiſe the Marqueſs <hi>de Bellfords,</hi> and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
<hi>Polier.</hi> There are great many others both kill'd
and wounded, whoſe Names I can't remember.</p>
               <p>But before I quit this Relation of the Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
I can't omit the generous Charity of the
Princeſs of <hi>Vaudemont</hi> at <hi>Bruſſels</hi> I wiſh that all
thoſe of her Communion, as the Popes have Cano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niz'd,
had as good a Title to be Saints: For the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of our wounded being greater than could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in the Hoſpital which the King had at <hi>Bruſſels,</hi>
a great many on the <hi>Monday</hi> in the Evening were ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with their Wounds up and down the Streets;
whereupon this excellent Princeſs, moved with a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99404:28"/>
Principle of Charity, went in her Coach at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with a great many <hi>Flambeaux,</hi> up and down
the Streets, to find them out, and had them conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the great Hall of her Palace, where ſhe ſaw them
dreſs'd of their Wounds her ſelf by her Surgeons, ſhe
and the Ladies of her Attendance giving Linnen and
other Neceſſaries for that purpoſe: And here ſhe main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
them till they could either be remov'd to the
other Hoſpitals, or till they were in a condition to go
abroad themſelves.</p>
               <p>The Day following the Mareſchal <hi>de Luxembourg</hi>
ſent a Trumpet in our Camp,<note place="margin">July 25./Aug. 4.</note> to give leave to Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
Servants to go to the place of Battel, to take care
of their Maſters Bodies as were kill'd upon the place,
and likewiſe to aſſure, that care would be taken of all
ſuch wounded Priſoners as they had. But Orders were
given out in our Army only for Field-Officers Servants
to go, and bring off the Bodies of their Maſters, as
lay dead upon the place; by which means the Bodies
of Sir <hi>Robert Douglas</hi> and Lieutenant Colonel <hi>Fuller<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
were brought off, and buried in our Camp at <hi>Halle.</hi>
As for my Lord of <hi>Angus,</hi> his Governour went, but
could not find his Body amongſt the Dead, nor hear
of him amongſt all the Priſoners. He had a Paſs on
purpoſe to go to the <hi>French</hi> Army to enquire for his
Lord.</p>
               <p>Our Army Forag'd towards <hi>Haute Croix,</hi> and a
Detachment of Horſe under the Command of Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant
General <hi>Sgravenmoor,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">26./Aug. 5.</note> ſent to cover our Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragers,
met with a conſiderable Detachment of <hi>French</hi>
Horſe, and was oblig'd to retreat. The Alarm came
quickly to our Army, and it appeared immediately
under Arms; but there was no conſiderable harm done
of either ſide in the two Detachments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:99404:29"/>
This day one <hi>Chevalier de Millevoix</hi> (ſo called for
his Excellency in Singing,<note place="margin">July 27./Aug. 6.</note> and a great Maſter in Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
who by it had got himſelf to be one of the
Elector of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Domeſticks, and was very much
conſider'd of him, inſomuch that he had a very good
Penſion, and made a very great Figure) was hanged
upon a Tree in the Front of our Right Wing of Horſe
for a Spy, and for having given, and endeavoured to
give Intelligence to the Mareſchal of <hi>Luxembourg,</hi>
which was intercepted by the Elector. The Boor he
employ'd bringing two of his Letters, one after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
to his Electoral Highneſs; and pretending to
<hi>Millevoix;</hi> that he had fallen amongſt ſome of our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments,
and had been oblig'd to fling them away.
His true Name was <hi>Jaquet,</hi> born at <hi>Liſle</hi> in the <hi>French</hi>
Conqueſts in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The King being advertiſed that the <hi>French</hi> Army
march'd from <hi>Enghien</hi> to <hi>Giſlenhem,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Aug. 1./11.</note> the King march'd
with all the Army, (except thoſe had been harraſs'd at
<hi>Steenkirk)</hi> to charge them in the Rear; but the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement
having been given too late, his Majeſty
could not overtake them. The <hi>French</hi> decamp'd in
great Secreſie, without any general Beating before, or
any Beat of Drum upon their March, and their Pikes
trail'd; which ſufficiently ſhews, they did not care
(notwithſtanding their Victory) for a Second Bruſh.
They left all our wounded Priſoners behind them at
<hi>Enghien,</hi> who were ſent the next day in Carts to <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels.</hi>
His Majeſty this day went as far as <hi>Enghien,</hi> and
had full view of the place of Battle, of the Enemies
Camp as it was before they march'd off, and before
we engag'd. Our Army not being able to overtake
the Enemies Rear, returned the ſame day to <hi>Halle.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:99404:29"/>
We Forag'd this day,<note place="margin">Aug. 2./12.</note> and the Detachment was put
under the Command of my Lord of <hi>Athlene,</hi> who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
informed that ſeveral of the Enemy lay in Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſcade
in a Wood to ſteal our Horſes, he ordered a
Party to beat the Wood, where Captain <hi>Rowland Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenzy,</hi>
of that Regiment as was Sir <hi>Robert Dowglas</hi>'s,
now my Lord <hi>George Hamilton</hi>'s, made Twenty Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners,
who begg'd very eerneſtly for Quarter, though
Orders had been to give none.</p>
               <p>This day the <hi>Chevalier de Grandval</hi> Knight of <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">3./13.</note>
                  <hi>Bartholomew Lanier</hi> by Name, born at <hi>Liniere</hi>
in <hi>Picardy,</hi> was Hang'd, Drawn and Quarter'd, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Puniſhment for Traytors) in
the midſt of our Camp, for having conſpir'd to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſinate
the King, with <hi>Du Mont</hi> and <hi>Levendael,</hi> the firſt
having diſcovered the buſineſs (as we have ſaid before)
to the Duke of <hi>Zell,</hi> and the ſecond to his Brother in
<hi>Holland:</hi> They were confronted as Witneſſes of the
Fact, which <hi>Grandval</hi> himſelf confeſſed and own'd.
This <hi>Grandval</hi> had before kill'd the Mareſchal <hi>de Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miere's</hi>
Nephew in a Duel; and as there is no mercy
in <hi>France</hi> for ſuch Men, he was oblig'd to fly to the
Duke of <hi>Savoy</hi>'s Country for ſhelter, where in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the War he took Service. But Monſieur
<hi>de Catenat</hi> finding this <hi>Grandval</hi> Serviceable to the
Duke of <hi>Savoy,</hi> repreſented it to the <hi>French</hi> King,
and deſired him to give him his Pardon; being aſſured
under-hand, that he would quit the Duke's Service if
he had it. Accordingly upon <hi>Catinat</hi>'s Requeſt, <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi>
had the Kings Pardon, and thus left the Duke of
<hi>Savoy,</hi> and came to <hi>Catinat</hi>'s Army, where he was
immediately preferr'd to be Major of Dragoons and
Adjutant General. <hi>Du Mont</hi> having been formerly an
Officer in the States Service, and diſoblig'd (I think
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:99404:30"/>
caſhier'd) by our King, he was reſolved to attempt a
Revenge by the aſſaſſinate of his Sacred Perſon; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
he made the Motion to the then Marqueſs
<hi>de Louvois;</hi> and this was deſigned to be executed in 91.
when the King was in the Field, either upon the March
of our Army, or at ſome other time when the King
rid abroad to view ſome Poſts. The Marqueſs <hi>de Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous</hi>
pitched upon this <hi>Grandval</hi> to bring the Aſſaſſin
off, who was to command a Detachment of ſome ſtout
deſperate Fellows for that purpoſe: For <hi>Louvois</hi>
thought this Man fit for the purpoſe, ſince he had been
ſo deſperate as to fight a Duel, contrary to the ſtricteſt
Orders of the <hi>French</hi> King, and in which there was
no hopes of Mercy, and alſo becauſe he had been ſo
much obliged by the <hi>French</hi> King in having his Pardon,
in a caſe in which the <hi>French</hi> King had never pardoned
before; and therefore he lay under ſome Obligation
to undertake this honourable Employment. But <hi>Du
Mont</hi> and <hi>Grandval</hi> miſſing of their Deſign that Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign,
and the Marqueſs <hi>de Louvois</hi> dying ſome time
after, it was laid by, and <hi>Du Mont</hi> retired to <hi>Hano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
Barbeſieux</hi> however finding this Project in his
Fathers Papers, would not let it fall, but ſent for <hi>Grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,</hi>
who accordingly entred into a new Negotiation
with <hi>Du Mont</hi> by Letters at <hi>Hanover,</hi> and took with
him a third Aſſociate, <hi>Levendael,</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
their meeting to execute their Enterprize at
<hi>Endhoven</hi> near <hi>Boiſleduc.</hi> I need not ſay any more
Particulars, I refer my ſelf to the <hi>Factum</hi> printed in
ſeveral Languages by Authority, to let the World
know ſo horrible a Villany, and what the <hi>French</hi>
Court will not attempt, though it be never ſo baſe
and unworthy, to rid themſelves of a powerful Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my;

his Sacred Majeſty's Glorious Anceſtor, as this was
carried with a Helliſh Secreſie; whereas the King of
<hi>Spain</hi> had by a publick Proſcription laid a Price upon
the Prince's Life. Theſe Traytors were invited to
this more than Helliſh Conſpiracy, by the Proſpect of
vaſt Rewards promiſed them both by the late King
and <hi>Barbeſieux,</hi> as has appeared by their own Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and <hi>Grandval</hi>'s own Letter to <hi>Mademoiſelle Juré,</hi>
wherein he deſired her to wait upon the Archbiſhop
of <hi>Rheins,</hi> to acquaint him, that he had obeyed the
Marqueſs <hi>de Barbeſieux</hi>'s Orders at the Expence of his
Life.</p>
               <p>My Lord of <hi>Athlone,</hi> General of the <hi>Dutch</hi> Horſe,

their Patron Saint, and reckoned amongſt them as a
Fortunate day: Our Left Flank laid very open all this
day's March, if they had pleaſed to attack it; but
they thought it not convenient, and ſo we came and
encamped in very cloſe Grounds at <hi>St. Levinus Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theim,</hi>
a pretty large Village, and conſiderable chiefly
for the Burying-place of St. <hi>Levinus,</hi> a <hi>Scotch</hi> Man,

This Town lies upon a Canal, between <hi>Newport,</hi> and

                  <note place="margin">Aug. 26./Sept. 5.</note> with the Detachment
under his Command, march'd from <hi>Newendam,</hi> and
came to <hi>Furnes,</hi> in <hi>Dutch</hi> called <hi>Vuernes,</hi> and encamp'd
cloſe by it; and a day or two after the Boars (that had
been ſummon'd about <hi>Ghendt</hi> and <hi>Bruges,</hi> with their
Spades and Shoovels, and other Inſtruments, to remove
the Earth, and had been commanded hither) began to
work about the Fortifications, being about 2 or 3000,
Col. <hi>Cambon</hi> being Engineer; nothing new was added
to the Fortifications, but only we renewed thoſe Works
as the <hi>French</hi> had ruin'd, when they left it the beginning
of this Campaigne. The Duke of <hi>Leinſter</hi> came like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
with the Tranſport-Troops, and encamp'd at <hi>Ooſt
Dunkirk,</hi> about a Mile from <hi>Talmaſh</hi>'s Detachment, and
at the ſame time he was joyn'd by a Detachment from
the great Army, of about thirty Squadrons of Horſe,
under the Command of Brigadier <hi>Boncourt;</hi> ſo that
now we made a Body of about Sixteen thouſand Men,
beſides the Garriſon of <hi>Furnes.</hi> We made Detachments
and Parties almoſt every Night towards <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> but
without meeting any of the Enemy's; and aſſoon as we
had put the Body of that place in a condition to hold an
Aſſault, palliſadoed it, and cleans'd the Ditch, we left
the Boars to repair the reſt of the Works, under the
cover of the Garriſon; we likewiſe left ſome Artillery
to put upon the Ramparts,<note place="margin">Sept. 7./17.</note> and ſo march'd to <hi>Dix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muyde,</hi>
the Battalion of Guards, <hi>Selwyn</hi>'s, and the Fuzi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers,
and ſome other Regiments having been ſent over
Night to poſſeſs themſelves of the place; which was put
<hi>per Interim</hi> under the Command of Brigadier <hi>Ramſey.</hi>
Upon our March, the Fort of <hi>Knock</hi> fir'd three Pieces of
Cannon, ſuppos'd to give Notice to the <hi>French</hi> of our
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99404:34"/>
march that way: This is a little ſquare Fort ſcituated
upon the River that comes to <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> about a
League and a half, and is very advantagiouſly poſted
upon a conſiderable Paſs between <hi>Ipres, Dixmuyde,
Furnes, Berg</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> the Canals between <hi>Ipres</hi>
and thoſe places meeting all here; ſo that the taking
of this Fort would have cut off the Communication
between <hi>Ipres, Berg</hi> and <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and would have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd
very much our Garriſon of <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> which
did lie now very open by the Neighbourhood of this
Fort.</p>
               <p>'Twas ſuppos'd we had a Deſign to attack it, ſince
our Train of Artillery, Mortar-pieces, and other things
neceſſary for an Attack were brought by Water from
<hi>Newport</hi> to <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> and that my Lords <hi>Portland</hi>
and <hi>Auverquerque</hi> were ſent from the King to the Duke
of <hi>Leinſter</hi> here, which looked like a Conſultation about
ſome conſiderable Enterprize: Beſides, Col. <hi>Cambon</hi>
our Engenier was ſent to view the place under the
<hi>Eſcorte</hi> of a good Detachment of Horſe. The Fort
fir'd upon them with their Canon, but without any loſs
on our ſide: But the <hi>French</hi> upon our March this way,
ſoon made a conſiderable Detachment from their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to cover this place, who encamp'd cloſe under the
Fort.</p>
               <p>When we came to <hi>Dixmuyde</hi> we encamp'd juſt by
it, in two Lines, having our Right at <hi>Caeskirk,</hi> where
the Duke of <hi>Leinster</hi> had his Quarter, our Left upon
the Town, and our Rear cover'd by the River <hi>Tſer,</hi>
upon which this Town is ſcituated, and which falls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the Sea at <hi>Newport.</hi> This Town, ſince the growing
Power of <hi>France,</hi> has ſuffer'd many Revolutions; it
was firſt taken for the <hi>French</hi> (as I have been told by
ſome ancient People of the Town) by the Mareſchal
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99404:34"/>
                  <hi>de Rantzaw,</hi> before the Siege of <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> and ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
afterwards by Treaty to the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> It was
then of a far larger Extent than 'tis now: For in the
Wars of 1672. the Count <hi>de Monterey,</hi> then Governour
of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> cauſed the Out Parts of
the Town to be pulled down to bring it in a more
convenient Compaſs for a Fortification, and for a place
of Defence, and ſo fortify'd it after the manner as we
find it now. But ſometime after the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Garriſon
finding themſelves very weak, and the Enemy not far
from them, they quitted the Place. I was told by the
Inhabitants, that it was about that time as <hi>Luxem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg</hi>
was beſieged. All this War the <hi>French</hi> have had
it in their Hands, making a Garriſon of it every Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
which with <hi>Furnes</hi> preſſed <hi>Newport</hi> very much,
the Garriſon making their Incurſions upon the Canals,
and ſometimes to the very Gates of <hi>Bruges.</hi> Every
Summer as they took the Field, they pull'd down their
Palliſadoes, and ſent them by Water to <hi>Ipres.</hi> This
Town has in it a Pariſh Church, in which there
is a Dean, and ſome Secular Canons, a Cloiſter of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collects,
and two Nunneries, and is in the Dioceſs of
<hi>Ipres.</hi> Juſt out of <hi>Ipres</hi> Port was formerly a Nunne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of the Order of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> which the Count <hi>de
Monterey</hi> cauſed to be pulled down, when he brought
the Town in the Precinct of that Fortification it has
now, and gave the Nuns another Cloyſter in exchange
for it in <hi>Bruges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We felt an Earthquake which laſted about two Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,<note place="margin">Sept. 8./18.</note>
and ſhook the Earth very violently; it was felt
at the ſame time all over <hi>Flanders,</hi> in many parts of
<hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and in other places of <hi>Europe:</hi>
We had it about Two of the Clock; it caus'd a great
Conſternation in our new Garriſon of <hi>Dixmuyde,</hi> ſome
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:99404:35"/>
thinking at firſt that the <hi>French</hi> had undermin'd ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
parts of the Town, and were in Ambuſcade going
to blow them up.</p>
               <p>The ſame day the Duke of <hi>Leinster</hi> cauſed the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to intrench, which was mark'd out by Col. <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,</hi>
our Left and Rear being cover'd by the Town and
the River. Our Retrenchments were drawn from the
Bridge upon the River along the Front of the Army,
and round our Right Wing, till they came to joyn the
River again. <hi>(Boufflers</hi> marching towards the <hi>Knock)</hi>
this Precaution was taken, in caſe he would have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to interrupt our Fortification of <hi>Dixmuyde.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>About as many Boors were (immediately upon our
coming) employ'd to repair the Works of this place as
we left at <hi>Furnes:</hi> We did not find the Fortification of
this Town ſo far ruin'd as at <hi>Furnes,</hi> and followed in
it (as there) thoſe Works as the Ruines preſcribed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
altering or making any new: We only made the
Ditch next the Body of the place larger, to make our
Baſtions of a better height. This Town has five Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions
on that part as is expos'd to an Attack that is
from the Windmil between <hi>Ipres</hi> port and tho River,
to the Gate as leads to <hi>Bruges.</hi> The Weſt ſide of the
Town is cover'd by the River, to which it joyns by
a Cauſey-way that leads to it, where it has a Bridge
cover'd on the out-ſide by a good Baſtion, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
with a ſquare Sconce, both ditch'd and palliſado'd.
The Canal of <hi>Newport</hi> goes through the South part
of the Town, and joyns the River a little below; and
being a perfect Moraſs on this ſide, it does not require
much Fortification. The Town is environ'd with a
double Ditch and cover'd way, and the Faces of each
Baſtion are cover'd with a Half-Moon, beſides good
ſpacious Ravelins upon the Curtins. This is what we
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99404:35"/>
had to repair; and to go on with the more Speed, a
Detachment of a hundred Men <hi>per</hi> Battalion (except
the Guards) were commanded to work, under the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection
of a Captain, Lieutenant and Enſign, each; ſo
that we had,<note place="margin">Sept. 10./20</note> Soldiers and Boors, very near 5000 Men
on work every day. The ſix Regiments that were in
Town came out and encamp'd, and ſix others were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
in their places, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Princeſs <hi>Ann</hi>'s, the Earl of
<hi>Bathe</hi>'s, Lord <hi>Caſtleton</hi>'s, Col. <hi>Venner's,</hi> Col. <hi>Mackay</hi>'s,
and Earl of <hi>Leven</hi>'s, and encamp'd within the Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts
of the Town, where, beſides the ordinary Guard,
a Re-inforcement of the <hi>Bewarke</hi> mounted every Night
at each Port towards the Enemy.</p>
               <p>This day the ordinary Detachments of the Earl of
<hi>Bathe</hi>'s Regiment and <hi>Fuſiliers,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">12./22.</note> being at work at the
Baſtion by <hi>Ipres</hi> part in enlarging the Ditch, found an
old hidden Treaſure, which quickly ſtopt the Soldiers
working, who fell all a ſcrambling in a heap one up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
another, ſome bringing off a very good Booty, ſome
Gold and ſome Silver, ſeveral <hi>Jacobus</hi>'s and <hi>Sovereins</hi>
being found by the Soldiers, and a great many old
Pieces of Silver of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, <hi>Charles</hi> the
Ninth, <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth's Coyn,
which are now hardly to be found in <hi>France.</hi> The
People of the Town ſuppoſe that this Money belong'd
to one <hi>Elfort</hi> a Gentleman, dead many years ago,
who bury'd his Treaſure (when the Mareſchal <hi>de
Rantzau</hi> took the Town) in the <hi>Bernardine</hi> Nuns Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
(this Ground where the Money was found having
been formerly in that Garden) which Count <hi>de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terey</hi>
cauſed to be demoliſhed; and they think that
there might have been about 900 Pound <hi>Groot,</hi> which
makes the value of Four Hundred and Fifty Guineas
Engliſh. This <hi>Elfort</hi> left it by Will to his Children,
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99404:36"/>
and the Marks where to find it, but his Children could
never diſcover it. 'Tis a wonder that it has not been
found till now, ſince the <hi>French</hi> have work'd every
Winter this War, and ſeveral times before, in repairing
the Works of this Fortification; 'tis very likely that
we ſhould have gone without it too, if we had not
enlarg'd the Ditch at this time.</p>

went Poſt to <hi>Bruſſels,</hi> where his Majeſty arriv'd <hi>Octob.</hi> 9.
and lay that night at his own Palace, and return'd the next
day to the <hi>Hague,</hi> after having held a Council of War with
the Elector of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and other great Officers of the
Army; my Lord of <hi>Athlone</hi> was thereupon detach'd from
the Army, with Ammunitions, Proviſions, and other
Neceſſaries for the Relief of <hi>Charleroy,</hi> with an <hi>Eſcorte</hi>
of 4000 Horſe and Dragoons, which his Lordſhip got
ſafely into the Town.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Boufflers</hi> having left <hi>Charleroy,</hi> the Armies on both
ſides began to ſeparate towards their Winter-Quarters.
Great Garriſons have been put in <hi>Bruſſels, Mecklen,
Ghent, Vilvord,</hi> and <hi>Dendermond,</hi> and along the Canal;
ſo that in Four and twenty hours time, upon any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>French,</hi> we can have a conſiderable Army
about <hi>Bruſſels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His Majeſty being come back to the <hi>Hague,</hi> ſail'd
ſome days after for <hi>England,</hi> where he arriv'd at <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth</hi>
the 18th day of <hi>October,</hi> and thence went to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
where His Majeſty was receiv'd with univerſal
Joy and Acclamation, for his happy and ſafe return.
And thus I have brought the relation of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
Tranſactions of this Campaign in the King's
Army to a concluſion, whereby it appears, that if other
things did ſecond the unwearied Pains, the indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Toyls and Labours His Majeſty takes, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinu'd
Dangers he expoſeth himſelf to, the <hi>French</hi> Arms
would not flouriſh ſo much as they have done hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to;
and whatever Advantages the <hi>French</hi> have really
had, or to which they pretend in this Campaigne, yet
the King's Subjects have not in the leaſt diſgrac'd the
Renown and Glory of their Anceſtors in it; but have
acquir'd to themſelves ſuch Reputation, as has forc'd
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:99404:38"/>
even a Commendation, and I may ſafely ſay, Fear
from their Enemies. We have a ſort of People, who
in magnifying the <hi>French</hi> Greatneſs, and how uſeleſs
our Efforts have been in <hi>Flanders</hi> to ſuppreſs it, would
inſinuate, that becauſe he is Great, that it is beſt to
yield to what we cann't reſiſt; and ſince we have had
no more ſucceſs in <hi>Flanders,</hi> 'tis beſt let it go, and ſtand
for the reſt upon our own Defence, which indeed is the
only way to break the Alliance, and have this very
Power (which they ſo much magnifie) wholly upon
our Arms, ſo that a Man has reaſon to ſuſpect, that
ſuch Inſinuations do underhand tend to introduce a
<hi>French</hi> Power amongſt us. If the <hi>French</hi> King is ſo
Great, all as a rational Man can infer is, that therefore
our Efforts ought to be ſo much the greater; and that
we are to make uſe of the utmoſt of our Powers, not
only to reſiſt, but to endeavour to humble this formi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable
Power, to which the way ſeems already open by
our Signal Victory at Sea; 'tis very plain, that if a
ſtop can be put to the <hi>French</hi> King's Proceedings, it muſt
be by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Power, and that 'tis only by the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
and Greatneſs of our Efforts as he can be humbled;
which I am ſure is a thing to be wiſh'd by all true <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>-men,
and to which every one that is ſuch will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute,
according to his Condition and Capacity, to
the utmoſt of his Power.</p>
