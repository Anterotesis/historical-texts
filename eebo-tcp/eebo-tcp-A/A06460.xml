            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>But alwaie sister remembre, that

                  <p>The ende of all the course and

                  <p>Charitie (saiethe he) is a good

Christ, the auctour and preacher of

and commaundeth me,<note place="margin">Luc. 6.</note> if I
be his disciple, not to resist ageinst

that hathe bee blowed me on the
righte, to leaue my gowne to hym
that hath taken from me my cote,
to walke two miles with hym that
hath vexed me, and compelled me
to walke one myle.</p>
                  <p>The forme of this lesson that
Christe here gyueth, is to enstructe
and warne all christen men, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde
nothynge of the bodye or of
the worlde, aboue the rest and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnesse
of the mynde: but that we
shoulde suffre the losse of our goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
with the hurte, ye with the
deathe of our bodies rather then
we shulde lose any smalle porcion
of charitie, to bee moued with any

passion of minde, wherby our loue
towarde god, myght decaie.</p>
                  <p>It is not possible, after Christes
doctrine, to take in this worlde by
any kynde of vyolence soo greatte
domage or hurte in bodye or goo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des,
as is the least drope of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in the mynde, where no tyrant,
nor the deuyll hym selfe hath any

our owne free wyll: soo that if we
will disordre our mynde with any
passion, we be to our selfe more vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olente
and cruell, than the deuyll
can be. Wherfore my good syster,
let vs beleue our maister Christe,
and to the deathe, lette vs neuer
breake peace with god. For if we
do, fare well all reste. We breake
peace with god, when we tourne
vs for any cause to the care of this
lyfe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="tcp:10189:13"/>If you fele your selfe inordynat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

with rebukes, with fals sclan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
with vntrue complaintes: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
syster, for surely you be not

                  <p>And if you beleue the sonne of god
your selfe with your owne will, do
more then any fierce prynce ouer
you coulde dooe, all thoughe he
brought you to extreme wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,

out comparison worse to bee sette


<pb facs="tcp:10189:14"/>
with these passions, than it is to
suffre the panges of death. But at
this pointe peraduenture you will
saie and aske me: whether we shuld
forsake al the commodities of this
worlde: whether we shulde make
no force to gette suche thynges, as
kepeth vp the welthe of our bodie:
whether we shulde vtterly refuse
all thynges ordeyned for this lyfe:
whether we shoulde be cleane care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
of good name? No no, syster
not soo. Holly scripture forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
vs nothynge, that is for vse
or profyte: as by Chrystes lawe
it is not forbyd to eate, to drynke,
to haue and gette, wherwith su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
sustinaunce maie bee maintey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
to gette chyldren, to haue mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
to haue possessions, to bee in
honour, to bee regarded: but the
worde of god suffrethe not glotto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,


<pb n="14" facs="tcp:10189:14"/>
and a delyte in the belye cheare,
nor lechery, and an vnlauful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
in bodylye lustes: nor coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tousnesse,
nor a gredye desyre to be
ryche: not vaynglory and a proude
desyre to be magnified. Lykewise
the commaundemente of god for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beadeth
vs not the thynkynge of
these and of suche other thynges:
but it is playne contrarye to the
wylle of god, that we shoulde with
any great intencion, solicitude, or
carefulnesse of mynde, prosecute
these bodyly necessities. And in
the hauynge of the goodes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocions,
and honours, we maie
not iudge to be any hygher at all,
then is to haue thynges for mans
necessitie: So that towarde theim
we maie not beare any maner of
loue or affection, but only we must
with suche a mynde take theym to


<pb facs="tcp:10189:15"/>
help forthe this lyfe, as the craftes
men take the instrumentes and
toles to helpe theyr handye woor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
that in the hauynge of ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
our mynde considre nothyng,
but a plentie of thynges appertei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
to our vse and necessytyes.
And thus we maie bothe for our

vs well, howe we shall
lyue: but it maie be noo care nor
yet any erneste studye, least ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
our charitie with god be dimy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nysshed.
For holde faste my syster
in your remembrance, that to haue
and kepe charitie with god,<note place="margin">To kepe Charitie with god.</note> is to
loue God with your holle herte,
with your hole mynde, with your
hole power. If any smalle parte
of your herte, or of your mynde,
or of your wit, be bestowed in any

                  <p>You maie right well syster putte

the loue of this worlde vppon
a mystruste of lyuynge, is a thyng
in the syght of god mooste detesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.
Thus I saie we maie vse this
worlde, but we maie not abuse hit,
whan for the world we breake cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie
with god. And if our herte be
not hollye gyuen to loue god, we
haue not god with perfyte chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:


<pb facs="tcp:10189:17"/>
god hath not our holle herte,

Charitie,<note place="margin">The waie to comme to perfytte Charitie.</note> to kepe our hert, our

And this is the dry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

be made dere frendes. In charitie
is no knowladge of any difference
betwene ryche and poore, betwene
maister and seruant, betwene bond

                  <p>Thus by our Charitie with god
we learne, what is our dueitie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde

your neyghbours and bretherne,
loke you deceiue not your selfe, for
hit is not inoughe to loue youre

man loueth euery man. Seconde
I maie loue my neyghbour of a

my sonne, or brother, or kynsman.
Thirdly I maie loue for vainglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye,
as if I loke by my neyghbour

couetousnes, as whan I cheryshe
and flatter a ryche manne for his

them that haue done me pleasures,
and may do me mo. The fifte waie,
I maie loue for my sensuall luste,
as when I loue to fare delicately,
or elles when I madde or dote vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon

<pb facs="tcp:10189:23"/>
The thyrde, the fourthe, and the

                  <p>Therfore syster, oute with your
loue, and consydre welle, in what
waie your herte is gyuen to loue

                  <p>To conclude nowe this mattier,
the whiche of him selfe is in sight,
lette vs knytte vppe charitie with

of Charitie. But whan I saie all
vertues, loke that you vnderstand
what is ment in the name of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue:
or elles this generalle clause
maie deceyue you. Wherfore you
must learne, that the body hath his

wyse hath his owne aparte frome
the other. The vertues of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die<note place="margin">Uertues of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dye.</note>
bee, as to faste, to watche, to
goo on pylgremage, to trauaille

your goodes in almes dedes, to
buylde vp churches, wherein the

and come together to praier, to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyshe

men dooe for the loue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour

if it bee soo that we lacke any of
theim. For they haue noo necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
nor constraynte of any thyng,
but all be frely vnder the election

whan it is generally said, that cha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ritie
maketh a man absolute and

in all the vertues of the

is perfecte in his vertues without

                  <p>Then boldelye we maie saie, that

<hi>BRO.</hi> It is a thyng syster,

For the summe of the hole is: This
charitie contaynethe all the lawes
of god, and teacheth vs our duetie
bothe towarde God and man: the
whiche charitie requirethe a quiete
spirite, and noo spirite is quyete,
that is subiecte to any passion.</p>
                  <p>Wherfore to haue charitie we must
chase from vs all passions to reste
so in our loue of god, that nothing

to be foly, honour to bee shame, so
depely we shulde be buryed in god
that to this lyfe our senses shoulde
lye deed, and quicke onelye in the
loue of god: from the whiche true
and entier loue of god, we shoulde
take a loue with all hertes affecte
to the hole kynde of man, in whom
beholde spiritually the ymage of
god: For the whiche image sake
we shulde beare no lesse fauour to
man than were sufficient to resiste
and vtterly vanquysshe all hate,
without the remembraunce of any
grudge to be taken with any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner

I wyll forgyue hym for cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie:
trouth it is that charitie signi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fieth
all these, and as I shewed to
you, muche more: for the woorde
in the same, that is in latine called
<hi>Charitas,</hi> the whiche signifiethe an
ordynate loue, and a due rule to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
god and man, the whiche
ordinate loue the soule hath, whan
he holly with all his power is wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
to god: so that besyde, he ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wyllethe nor desyrethe anye
thyng. By the whiche feruent loue
in god, he exerciseth amonge men
all the kinde of vertue. And thus


<pb facs="tcp:10189:30"/>
was the fyrst thyng syster, to haue
you to knowe, what the woorde of
charitie sygnifieth. <hi>SISTER.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Me thought brother, that fyrst of
all you shewed, that charitie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyneth
all goddes lawes. <hi>BRO.</hi>
I dyd in dede, to brynge you to
the syght of the greatte compasse,
that was in the name of Charitie.
wherby you might the better lerne
that in englysshe tongue we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue
but a lyttell porcion of this
infinite vertue, whan we commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
speake therof. But howe soo
euer I begonne, the fyrste poynte
of youre lesson was to learne the
strengthe of charities name. <hi>SIS.</hi>
I wold nowe aske you the second,
if it cam not in my minde to doubt,
whether charitie and loue bee not
all one, as in communycacion I
haue harde some clerkes saie they


<pb n="31" facs="tcp:10189:30"/>
be. <hi>BRO.</hi> I thinke well some cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
wyll so saie. For I note in the
last englishe translacion of the gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pels
out of latine, the translatour
alwaie for <hi>Charitas</hi> writeth Loue:
wherin I can not consent with him
For after mine opinion there is as
muche difference betwene loue and
charity, as it is in your occupacion
betwene threde and twined threde.
For you will saie, that all twined
threde is threde, but all threde is
not twined threde: So this worde
Loue is more commen and more
general then is charitie. For trouth
it is, that all Charitie is loue: but
it is not trouthe, that all loue is
charitie. In greke charitie is <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gape,</hi>
and loue, is <hi>eros,</hi> as in latine
loue is <hi>amor,</hi> and charitie is <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas.</hi>
In all these thre tonges there
is the same difference in the tone


<pb facs="tcp:10189:31"/>
woorde frome the tother, that is a
penne and a quylle. All our pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
for the moste parte be quylles:
but all our quylles be not pennes:
The quylle is that remaineth in
his nature, without any other fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
or forme put to it: the penne
is a quille shaped, and formed, and
made apte to write. Lyke wise loue
is the common affecte of fauoure:
charitie is loue reduced in to a due
order towardes god and man, as
to loue god alone for him selfe, and
to loue man for goddes sake. Do
you perceyue syster what I saye?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>SVS.</hi> Me thynketh brother, that
you meane as I woulde saie, that
betwene charitie and loue is a like
difference, as is betwene my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
and wiers. For I see that my
pierles bee wiers, but they haue a
facion by my labour putte to, the


<pb n="32" facs="tcp:10189:31"/>
whiche facion wyers haue not.</p>
                  <p>And here maie I saie as you saied
of Charitie and Loue, that al pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les
be wyers but all wyers, be not
pierles: But brother, if all chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
be loue, what defaulte put you
in the translatour, the whiche wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
loue for <hi>Charitas. BROTHER.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The same defaulte I put in hym,
that you wold put in one, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
doth giue to you wiers for pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les,
or quyls for pennes. But sister
remembre, you wolde haue me bee

but the beste shortenesse is to bee

I praie you telle me the secounde
poynte.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BRO.</hi> The seconde was to shewe
you, that charitie could not be had


<pb facs="tcp:10189:32"/>
without the assured myndes quy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etnes,
as an effecte folowynge the
same, the whiche stedfast quietnes
of mynde is not to be inordinatlye
styrred or moued with passions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>SIS.</hi> Sauyng your tale brother:
I praie you tell me some englyshe
woorde what you call passion.</p>
                  <p>For truely I knowe no nother pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion
but the passion of Christe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BRO.</hi> Than I haue loste many
wordes. For I thoughte I hadde
sufficiently declared vnto you, that
any mouynge of the mynde in to
an vngodlye desyre, was called a
passion, as malyce, rancour, yre,
enuy, ambicion, couetousenes, let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery,
glottony, pryde, hatred, stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of prayse, study of auengynge,
and suche other, whiche styrre vp
and moue the mynde oute of his
naturall reste, to loue or to hate


<pb n="33" facs="tcp:10189:32"/>
without reason and measure: As
whan our bodie suffreth any tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
we saie, we be in a passion: so
when our mynde suffreth any su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
inordinat desires, we haue the
myndes passion: and euery suche
mocion of mynde out of due cours
is called a passion. The mynde is
moued out of his due cours, as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as hit is stirred with these af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectes,
that bee engendred of our
principall loue to this lyfe, as to
bee dispraised with oure dispraises
or sclaunders is a thyng that ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth
in vs frome the loue of this
lyfe, where if we studie to be mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified,
we bee in a soore passion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynst
reason, the whiche teacheth
vs to seke our glorye in more sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
thynges, then can bee founde
in this life. But bycause you speke
of the worde, shortely as you saie,


<pb facs="tcp:10189:33"/>
it is no veraie englysshe woorde:
howe be it whan we bee dryuen to
speake of thynges that lacke the
names in our tongue, we bee also
driuen to borowe the wordes, that
we haue not, sometyme out of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,
sometyme out of greke, euen
as the latine tongue dothe in lyke
necessitie borowe and take of other.
And thoughe nowe at the firste he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
this worde standeth straunge<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
with you, yet by vse it shal waxe
famyliar, specially whan you haue
it in this maner expressed vnto you.</p>
                  <p>Nowe then to obteine this reste
of mynde, the chefe effecte of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie,
we must beware that no passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
rule in vs, but alwayes in all
thynges we muste ordre our desy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res
by the draughte and traine of
this one desire, the whiche we haue
for louing god alone with all our


<pb n="34" facs="tcp:10189:33"/>
holle hertes, power, wittes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellygence,
neuer suffring aduised<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye
the corrupte loue of this false
flattering lyfe, to haue any smalle
place in our soule, wherby we shuld
waxe the weaker in the full vniyng
and knittyng of all our intencions
to the wille and pleasure of god.
And syster, it was the seconde part
of your lesson. <hi>SISTER.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ye brother I wolde I had lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

                  <p>It were an aungels condicion to

you by this, to speake thus, as
thoughe it were possible, to make

As fyrste we muste be endued

no mind to kepe their masters plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure,
but only loke vpon the punish<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment,
our feare must be a reuerence

at this time (my her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
beloued Edmond)
that I am in suche
place, where I haue
noo maner of bokes
with me, to passe the tyme after my
maner and custome. And thoughe
I had here with me plentie of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes:
yet the place suffreth me not
to spende in theim any studie. For
you shall vnderstande, that I lye
waitynge on my lorde Cardinall,
whose houres I muste obserue, to
be alwaie at hande, lest I bee cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
whan I am not by: the whiche
shuld be streyght taken for a fault
of greatte negligence. Wherfore,
now that I am well saciated with


<pb n="40" facs="tcp:10189:39"/>
the beholdynge of these gaie han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gynges,
that garnyshe here euery
wall: I will tourne me and talke
with you. For you muste knowe,
that my mynde hath long coueted,
to shewe what affecte I beare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde
you: the which hitherto par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture
I neuer vttered vnto
you soo plainely, that you myghte
take thereof any perfecte knowe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladge.
And that I so dyd kepe in,
suche outwarde tokens, wherof
when you were with me, you shuld
haue perceiued my loue: the cause
was none other, but that in dede,
I loued you. For long I haue ben
taught that the maister neuer hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
his scholer more,<note place="margin">Howe mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters hurte their scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers moste.</note> than whan
he vttereth and sheweth by chery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing

he beareth to his scholers. I think
you lacked with me no cherishing,


<pb facs="tcp:10189:40"/>
but of cokering you had veraie ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell,
bycause I was lothe to hurte
you: the whiche lothnesse came, I
saye, of that I loued you. But now
in as muche you be of age, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
by the common borde of house<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lynge
admitted in to the noumbre
of men, to bee noo more in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
of children, and specially for
as muche as my rule ouer you is
ceassed, I will not deferre any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
the expressing of mine hert, that
no lesse loueth and fauoureth you,
than yf nature had made you, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
my son or my brother. For this
alwaie is my mynde, if I haue a
frend, in whom I fynde such faith,
and honestee, that I inwardly ioy
in hert with him: I reken streight,
that al his be mine without any ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cepcio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>:<note place="margin">Trewe frendshyp.</note>
So that in very dede I take

that bee in my frendes care.</p>
                  <p>This mynde hadde I to my frende
Andrewe Smythe, whose sonne,
Christofer your felow, I euer toke
for my sonne: and nowe I thinke
plainely, that he is so in very dede.
This strengthe hath trewe loue in
frendeshyp, the whiche hath like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
ioyned your father in such ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ner
to my herte, that me thinke you
shulde be no more his son than you
be myne. And though I can suffre
your father to take the rule of you,
more then I do: yet I can not suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fre,
that he shoulde care more for
your profyte than I do. For as I
desire and wysshe, that you neuer
haue nede of me: soo surely yf you
euer shoulde haue, it shoulde well
than appere, that as nature hath
gyuen you one father, so your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers

you an other father. Wherefore
good Edmonde, reken no lesse af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecte
in me to do you good, than is
in your owne father, whose onely
studie and care is, to se you growe
and prosper towarde the state of an

is. and as muche as I can, I will
helpe you bothe with my counsaile

                  <p>¶If you wil cal to your minde al

Smith, you shall finde, the causes

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:10189:41"/>
that you bee of better habilitee to
take counsaile, I will begynne to
shewe you my mind, in staiyng you
for the hole course of your life, that
you maie in time learne, what is to
be done, to be a good and an honest
man. You be yet in the firste entre
of your lyfe, and nowe is the tyme
to haue a guide, that may faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conducte you in the right waie.
For there be so many pathes, and
for the moste parte all by pathes be
more worne with the steps of your
foregoers, than is the veraie true
pathe of liuyng: that if you go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone
you maie paraduenture long
wander out of the streighte waie.
Wherfore as nere as I can, I will
in fewe wordes apoynte vnto you
certaine markes, vpon the whiche
if you dilygently loke, you can not
erre nor faile of the waie, that lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dethe


<pb facs="tcp:10189:42"/>
to the rewarde of an honeste
good man, whose vertue sauoureth
pleasauntly to heauen, pleaseth the
worlde, and nourishethe hym selfe
with an incomparable delyte and
gladnes, that continually reigneth
in his cleane and pure conscience.
With these markes and tokens,
the whiche I wolde you loked still
vpon, I will assigne you certaine
auctors, in whose workes I wolde
you shoulde bestowe your lesure,
when you maie haue time to reade,
that by theim you maie at the fulle
be instructed in all thynges apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinyng
to vertue: and in all your
lyfe I wolde you medled not great<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
with any other bokes, then with
these, that I shall name vnto you:
It is not the readyng of many bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
that getteth increase of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladge
and iudgement: for the moste


<pb n="43" facs="tcp:10189:42"/>
parte of them, that redeth all indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently,
confounde their wits and
memory without any notable fruit
of their readyng. It muste be a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygente

No man (specially of theim
that haue other occupacions) can
vse readyng, but in very fewe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
the whiche I wolde shulde be
piked out of the best sorte: that the
fruite of the reders diligence maie
bee the greatter. I see many lose
their tyme, when they thinke to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowe
their time best: bycause they
lacke iudgement or knowladge, to

worthy to be studied. And in euery

am in doubt, whether you haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

that can thus teach you with a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

you order your will, I putte noo
doubte, but first the grace of god
shall be roted in you, and next you
shall liue with a mery hert, and fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally

man, whose condicions I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

than in great aboundance to bee a

for otherwise you shal deceiue your

that as well worldly wisedome, as

                  <p>¶First and last (myne owne good
withipol) remembre earnestely to
haue in your mynde three certaine
thynges, the whiche be of suche va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lure,
that he that forgetteth either
their dignitie and nature, orels the
degrees and order of theym: he
canne not please neither god, nor
himselfe, nor the worlde. I saie, in
all the course of your life, there he
thre thinges to bee loked so vpon,


<pb facs="tcp:10189:44"/>
that the fyrste of them must be fyrst
of you regarded: the seconde next<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
after, and the thirde in his place af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the second. Beware, as of dede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
poyson, that you ruffil not than
without care, one before the other,
as to take the .iii. in the place of
the firste, or the secounde after the
thyrde, or both the seconde and the
thirde before the first. In this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion
you shall (as I haue saied)
both offend god and displease your
selfe, and also nothyng content the
worlde. Like as the most parte of
men nowe a daies treaspasse all for
the rechefulnes and negligence in
not kepyng these .iii. thynges, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the dignitee and degree accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng
as they ought to be obserued
and kepte. And what bee we (my
good Edmond) if we be out of god

<pb n="45" facs="tcp:10189:44"/>
and dispiteful to men. Therfore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine
I exhorte you, to the entente
you maie eschewe this abhomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
condicion, and growe to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in the blessed noumbre of
them that reste in the grace of god,
in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>lennes of their conscience,
and in the fauour of the worlde, to
bee iudged a good, a wise, and an
honeste man. For this finall ende
mine exhortacion is now, that you
in all your actes, in the hole course
of your life, remembre these three
thynges, that I will reherse vnto
you. But I saie to you, that you
must not onely remembre these thre
thynges, but also specially haue in
minde the degres of them: so that
euer the first of theim be cheifely in
your thought aboue all other: and
than in his place put the seconde,
and let not the thyrde be regarded,


<pb facs="tcp:10189:45"/>
but as his place requireth, that is,
whan you haue done with the first,
and also with the secounde. There
lieth more weighte and valure vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the knoweyng and kepynge of
this tale, that I shall tel you: then
if I could shew you the waie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
fewe monethes, to bee a man of
great power, bothe in excedyng a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundaunce
of ryches, and also in
passing auctortie of rule. Therfore
as wel for the fruit, that foloweth,
if you doo after mine exhortacion,
as for the infinite hurtes, that you
can not escape, if you shoulde for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get
that I sai: I warne and warne
you a gayne, here this lesson with
a glad eare, and print the same in
your minde, to execute with liuely
diligence the effect of this cousail,
wherin is conteined your life and
deathe, your ioye and sorowe, as


<pb n="46" facs="tcp:10189:45"/>
wel in this world, as in that shalbe
hereafter: These .iii. thinges, be the
Soule,<note place="margin">Soule.</note> the Bodye, and the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
of this world. The first place
hath by good reson the Soule, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
it is a thing immortall, that is
created and made after the figure
and shape of almightye god. The
next &amp; seconde roume hath the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,<note place="margin">Bodie.</note>
as the case and sepulture of the
soule, and nereste seruaunt to the
secretes of the spirite. The thirde
roume occupiethe the riches and
goods of this world,<note place="margin">Goodes of this worlde.</note> as y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> necessary
instrume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tes or toles for the bodie,
the whiche can not wante nor lacke
such thinges. Lette than the eie of
your inward mind first and cheifly
euer behold the first thing in you, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi>
is your Soule: Next therto haue a
respect to your body: &amp; thirdly co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> world: care for your Soule, as


<pb facs="tcp:10189:46"/>
for your cheife iewel and onely trea
sure. Care for your Bodie, for the
soules sake. Care for the worlde,
for the bodies sake. Beware aboue
all thinges, that you go not backe
warde, as he doth, that careth first
to be a riche man, next to be an hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
man, and thirdely to be a good
man: where he shoulde doo cleane
contrary, fyrste to studie for good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
nexte for helthe, and then for
welthe. You see so great blindnes
among men, that some folke so ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
for ryches, that very litle they
loke for the helthe of the bodie, and
nothyng at all they minde the state
of the soule. I saie to you, some fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes
doo thus, I woulde to god I
might not truely reporte, that for
the mooste parte all men in maner
nowe a daies dooe no notherwise.
Loke vpon either the spiritual sort


<pb n="47" facs="tcp:10189:46"/>
or the temporall, and muche a doo
you shall haue, in the great swar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
multitude of this blinde sort,
to finde out theim that first aboue
all thinges care for their soule, next
for their bodie: and thirdly for goo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
of this world. You shal se mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chauntes
spare no trauaile nor ieo
pardie of the body, to get these goo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des.
They be (to saie the trouth) so
occupied in the studie of this thirde
thing, that scante thei haue time to
care for the second: &amp; as for the first
thei passe nothig thervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, it semeth
a thing lest in their thought, where,
of conuenienci the same care, studi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

and thought, that they gyue to the
opteining of these worldly goodes,
thei shuld spende it all in the main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenaunce
of the first thyng, that is
the Soule: and the small littel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garde,
that they take for the fyrste,


<pb facs="tcp:10189:47"/>
shulde be bestowed for the thirde:
and more than thei doo, thei shulde
cherisshe the seconde.</p>
                  <p>¶The same confusion is with vs
scholers,<note place="margin">Sholars.</note> for our first studi is to get
promocion, to get these goodes, to
liue welthily. In this care we busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
be occupied continually. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more we cherisshe our bodies
than dothe the marchant: but our
cherisshing is for the longer vse of
these goodes, not as it shulde be for
the soules sake. And as for the
soule we haue as litel regard as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men haue, although we speke
therof more than paraduenture o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
men do.</p>
                  <p>This ouerthwarte confusion of
these three thynges marrethe all.
And plainly I may sai, that al mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheife
cometh onely of this misor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
that we put the cheife care of


<pb n="48" facs="tcp:10189:47"/>
our studie to the thirde thyng, and
not to the fyrste, as of duit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

oughte to dooe the contrarye. If
my purpose were to shewe youe,
what other men do, and not rather
what I woulde haue you dooe: I
woulde further procede to expresse
vnto you, how farre out of square
our life is nowe a daies: and howe
blessed a life we shulde haue in this
transitorie world, if the care of our
soule were firste and cheifelye in
mens myndes, lyke as the care of
the worldely substaunce occupieth
oure hertes aboue all other thyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
If it were as it oughte to
be, that in our phantasie reygned
the studie for the Soule, thanne
shulde be here that celestiall king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,
the whiche Chryste teacheth

treasure, that you haue: wherv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
your continuall thoughte and
care must be, to kepe it, to defende
it, to nourishe it, to comforte it, by
all waies and meanes possible for
you. In this study you must spend
all your wittes, nyghte and daie
you muste thynke on this thynge,
what so euer you do, you must dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recte
your acte to this thynge. If
you bee occupied in the state of
your bodie, either to driue awaie
sickenesse, or to susteine helth, lette
it bee for the seruyce your bodye
oweth to the soule. If you trauaile
for goodes of this worlde, to gette
your owne liuyng, or to helpe your
frende, or elles to prouide for your
children, when god shall sende you
theim: let your trauaile be for the
necessities of the bodie, and so fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
for the soule. Consider what


<pb facs="tcp:10189:49"/>
the goodes of the worlde be, howe
they bee but instrumentes for the
bodie. Use than the worlde in his
kynde. Loke againe vppon your
bodie, howe it is preciouser than
the goodes: vse hym than in his
worthynes, and hurt not your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die
for a thyng of lesse value. And
as ye haue nothynge, nother your
bodie nor your goodes, to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
with the dignitee of youre
soule: so my swete Withipol, lette
nothyng be in your reputacion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue
this cheife and principal iew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ell,
the whiche muste onely for him
selfe be cared for, and al other thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
in this life, muste be cherisshed
for it. I sticke muche with you in
repetyng one thyng, but maruaile
not thoughe I so do: for I see vs
all in this worlde so blynded, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by a vse and custome frome the


<pb n="50" facs="tcp:10189:49"/>
cradill, in the magnifiyng of these
goodes, partely by the insaumple
of theim, with whome we be daiely
conuersaunt: that scant after long
criyng, it can nowe be harde, that
the Soule must bee cheifely cared
for. And excepte grace worke with
you, that you your selfe wyll con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sente
to the trouthe, it is not possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to perswade you, that the vcrie
true waie of liuyng is this, to care
cheifely for the soule, and to care
for all other thynges onely for the
soules sake. This saiyng though
it be true, yet I saie, it can not bee
harde: in as muche the liues of all
theim, with whome ye shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
conuersaunt, shal crie out
clene contrarie against my saiyng.
For on all sydes you shall see men
sweatyng in a continuall worke,
bothe of bodie and of minde, to get


<pb facs="tcp:10189:50"/>
these worldely goodes, without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
mencion made of the Soules
state, the whiche the veraie friers
care lyttell for, as it openly appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth.
But euer I saie to you, loke
what christen men shulde doo, and
if you se men so do, be glad of that
sight, and folowe the same: if you se
the contrary, flee from the ensaum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and cleaue euer fastely to the
trouth with a sorowful hert for the
losse of other men that so blyndely
rushe forthe in the traine of a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
liuyng, where the Soule, is so
lyttel cared for.</p>
                  <p>¶That this fyrste thyng maie be
the better in your studie, I wylle
briefely touche somewhat of two
thynges that appertaine hereto: to
haue you knowe what nourisheth
and comforth the Soule, and what
hurteth and noyeth the same. The


<pb n="51" facs="tcp:10189:50"/>
Soule can not but euer lyue, it
hath noo ende of liuynge: yet we
maie saie, that the soule lyueth and
dieth? It liueth in the grace of god,
and dieth in the malice of the deuil.
The Soules lyfe is the lighte of
vertue: his death is the darkenes
of synne. You haue a free will gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen
you,<note place="margin">Free will.</note> whereby you maie either
quicken or slaie at your owne plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure,
your Soule in the bryghte
paradyse of lyfe, and you maie set
your soule in the blacke dungeon
of deathe. Let therfore this will of
yours euer studie to procure for the
soules lyfe, the which is your owne
life: and in the same study you shall
deliuer the soule frome his deathe,
the whiche is the perpetuall paine
ordained for sinne, that seperateth
the ymage of god frome his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trone.
I saie, synne plucketh your


<pb facs="tcp:10189:51"/>
soule from god, whose ymage your
soule shulde beare. Therfore in all
your actes so do, that you willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
displease not god: who can not
be pleased but with a pure and cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ane
conscience: pure and cleane if
you suffre no sinne to remaine soo
long in your desyre and mind, that
it cankarethe the thoughte. Your
thought is cankared with the long
residence of synne, when either you
be weake in the studie of vertue, or
elles make veraie littell of a fault,
or defend your vice, or nowsel your
selfe in a custome of an inordinate
desyre. The frailenes of our fleshe
is so great, that it can not bee, but
that sinne shall come to our desire:
but it is our blame, if sinne tarie
and abyde with in vs. God hath
gyuen vs a mightie power ouer
our selfe: we maie whan we wyll


<pb n="52" facs="tcp:10189:51"/>
correcte our desires, and dryue out
all synne. If you knowe not what
is Sinne, nor what is vertue: by
the feare and loue of god you shall
knowe both. The feare of god<note place="margin">Feare of god.</note> will teache you to fle sinne, and folowe
vertue. The loue of god<note place="margin">Loue of god.</note> will tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
you to folowe vertue, and slee
sinne: wherby your preuie and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crete
conscience shall better and
more clerely perceiue, what is to
be done, and what is not, than any
diffinicion or descripciou can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poynte
out to you. Therfore my
dere Withipol, enwarpe your selfe
faste and sure in the feare and loue
of god, from your fyrste rysyng to
your reste, drawe forth the daie in
all your busines, as this louynge
feare and feareful loue shal secret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
admonishe and warne you: and
die rather than you wolde pursue


<pb facs="tcp:10189:52"/>
any lust against your knowladge
of goddes pleasure.</p>
                  <p>¶What marchandyse so euer you
occupie, remembre, it is the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of the thirde care, for the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
you maie not leaue any poynte
of this fyrst care, that belongeth to
the soule. Likewise if ye be occupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
aboute the bodie, remembre, it
is the worke of the seconde care, the
whiche also muste be ordered vnto
the fyrste, the whiche first must al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waie
sticke in your mynde, sturred
vp and led in all desyres and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
by the saied feare and loue of
god. Do neuer that thinge, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
you feare goddes displeasure.</p>
                  <p>¶More particularly in wrytyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
you shall learne this lesson, if
you wolde some tyme take in your
handes the Newe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stamente,<note place="margin">Newe te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament.</note> and
reade it with a due reuerence. For


<pb n="53" facs="tcp:10189:52"/>
I wolde not haue you in that boke
forget, with whome you talke. It
is god that there speketh, it is you
a poore creature of god that rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dethe.
Consider the matche, and
meke downe youre wittes. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
not in no case to thynke, that
there you vnderstand ought: leaue
deuisyng thervpon: submit your
selfe to the exposicions of holy doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours:
and euer conforme your con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sent
to agre with Christis churche.
This is the sureste waie that you
can take, both before god and man.
Your obedience to the vniuersalle

althoughe it might bee in a faulse

The whiche god woulde haue

                  <p>¶Yet before I leaue this thyrde
care, I will shewe you my minde,
what is cheifely in this parte to be
cared for: as the beste porcion of
worldely ryches. Surely I reken
no possession of landes, nor yet no
substaunce of marchaundise, nor
yet no abundance of money,<note place="margin">A good frende.</note> to bee


<pb n="62" facs="tcp:10189:61"/>
comparable to a good frend. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
aboue al thinges in this world,
procure to haue plentie of frendes,
and make of them your compte, as
of your beste and mooste precious
goodes. Alwaies your frend shall
be more profitable to you than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
treasure or power beside can be.
Howe you shall knowe theim that
be worthy to be your frendes, and
by what meanes, and what waie
frendes, be bothe gotten and also
kepte, ye shall beste learne in Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros
littell boke <hi>De amicitia,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cicero de amicicia.</note> I can

that is lefte of hym, wherfore I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
you to that worke.</p>
                  <p>¶An other pointe touchyng this
care of worldely goodis, is to vse
accordyngly your wyfe, whan the
time shall come that you shall haue
one. For to opteine substaunce of


<pb facs="tcp:10189:62"/>
goodes, it lyethe as muche in the
wife, to kepe that you bring home,
as in your trauaile to bryng home.<note place="margin">Houswife.</note>
And surely onlesse she be the keper
and sparer, the houseband shall lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
goo forwarde in his labour of

that there is noo yuell housewife,
but for hir faultes the good man is
to be blamed. For I am vtterly of
this opinion, that the man maie
make, shape, and forme the woman
as he will. I woulde good further
with you in this thinge, and shewe
somwhat of the waie to order your
householde, if I sawe not this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier
so largely intreated of dyuerse
philosophers, of whom ye shal here

the worke leseth a great parte
of the grace, that it hathe in the
greke tonge, and also his transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion
in many places is false: and it
plainely appereth, that Raphaell
vnderstode not well, what Xeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon
wrote in greke. I haue ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
for diuers of my frendes sake,


<pb facs="tcp:10189:63"/>
translated the same worke oute of
greke tonge into englishe, and you
shall haue the same with my good
wylle, whan your pleasure is to
reade it.</p>
                  <p>¶I wolde also for some parte of
this thirde care, haue you read the
vii. and the .viii. boke of Aristo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels
politikes,<note place="margin">Politie. Aristot.</note> for to here his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile,

thinges.</p>
                  <p>¶This is the effecte and summe,
mine owne good Edmond, of my
counsaile, touchyng the thre saied
thinges in the which I reken to rest
the hole course of your lyfe: and if
you obserue and kepe them in their
degrees and order accordyngely,
you shall surely content god, nexte
please your selfe, and thirdely sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
the worlde. One the contrary

part, misorder these cares, and you
shall renne into the vengeaunce of
god, in to the hate of your self, and
in to the indignacion of all men.
Behold I praie you these hungrie

                     </gap> whan thei
remembre their faulse swearinges,
their deceitefull bargaines, their
plaine robberies, their pollynges,
their cruel exactions, their oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synges
of the poore menne? what
hope haue they of goddis fauour,
whan they remembre all their care
and thoughte hathe bene for the
welthe of this worlde? the whiche
when they leaue and forsake, they
despeire of all other welthines: in


<pb facs="tcp:10189:64"/>
as much their mindes neuer ernest<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
cared for that welthe, the whiche
euer endureth. This remembrance
of their misorder, is an heuy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
to their conscience. It can not
be otherwyse. Consyder nowe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gayne,
howe clere and lyghte his
mynde is, that in all his lyfe hath
euer cheifely studied for the soules
welthe, that remembreth euer how

of vertue? Of this man how well
doth euery man speake? what ioye
and comforte enbraceth the consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of this man, whan the hande
of god calleth hym from his shorte
lyfe, to that perpetuall lyfe, for the
whiche he hath so much laboured?
The tother be he neuer so riche, is
called a faulse felowe, a wretched
knaue. This man, be he neuer so
poore, is called an honest person, a

good man, for whome the heauen
gates standethe open, whilest the

This is the ende of misorder,
and this is the ende of good order,
in breakynge and kepynge the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
of the foresaied .iii. thynges.
Wherfore I can not warne you to
often to take hede of this counsail:
and you can not to often here the

if you shulde forget this tale, it is
no lesse perill than vtter shame in

You be not forboden to

For to speake truelye,
there is no care but one, nor there
be no goodes but of one. We must
haue a certaine slyghte regarde to

that to care, wer to take an inward

This saiyng good Withipol,
I speake to ease and comfort your
minde: for by this tale that is true,
you nowe learne, that althoughe
before I saied you shuld haue thre
cates in this lyfe, yet in dede you
haue but one care, the whiche is to
care for the true goodes, that be to
be purchased for the soules welthy
state. Wherfore of your thre cares,
stryke of two, if you will speake of
ernest care. Yet I will sticke a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
more with you in this poynte:
for fame I wolde you shoulde se a
true marke, wherby you maie go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne
and rule al your phantasies


<pb n="75" facs="tcp:10189:75"/>
and opinions. If your phantasie
be well directed to the true marke,
you can not mysse of the right path
to vertue, the which bryngeth man
thyther, where he shall receiue the
inestimable rewarde for his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile.
I saie your soule onely must
bee cared for: and this onely care
muste be to gette and kepe the true
goodes, that bee onely the goodes
of the minde. Other goodes be not
called proprely goodes. You see,
howe these pratie commodities of
the bodie, and also these small gyf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes
of fortune, maugre our heade,
be taken from vs, as I can not es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
alwaie sickenes, I can not es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
misfortunes: I can not fle fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
the cruell handes of tyrauntes, I
maie be cast into tortures, I maie
rotte in fetters, I maie lose all my
substaunce, by water, by fier, by


<pb facs="tcp:10189:76"/>
theues, or by other violente rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie.
Against these chaunces noo
man can resist, no care nor thought
preuailethe to assure vs, either of
oure bodies, or of suche goodes.
Wherfore learne you, that I saie
before god, we haue noo goodes,
but onely the goodes of the spirite
and minde, the whiche goodes (as
I haue saied) be so sure ours, that
thei can not be taken from vs, but
with our owne will, consentyng to
the losse of theim. In this spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
possession, euery man is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinsible
emperour. We maie des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pise
all vyolence of prynces, all
worldely chaunces, touchyng the
kepyng of vertue ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ger the hole
power of the dyuell, and all his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue.
Hereof learne and marke
mine Edmonde, wherin you maie
be hurted, that your care maie the


<pb n="76" facs="tcp:10189:76"/>
better bee bestowed. For to care,
where you have no hurt, it is nede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les:
or not to care, where you bee
hurted, is a blynde ignorance. We
be hurted, whan we lose any part of
gods fauour: we lose gods fauour,
wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we lose any goodes of the mi<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d: we
lose the goodes of the mind, wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
we either reioice of the hauing bodili
&amp; worldly goodes, or make sorow
of the lacking the same. We be not
hurted whan god continuethe his
fauour, whan we decaie not in the
strengthes of minde: we decaie not
in the strengthes of minde, whan
we bee not ouercome, neither with
the gladnes of the bodies and worl<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
prosperitee, nor with bewaie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
of their aduersitee. Thus you
se, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>her in the goodes of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die,
nor in the goodes of the world,
you can other take or escape hurte:


<pb facs="tcp:10189:77"/>
it is onely the vertue of your mind,
wherin you muste serche, whether
you be saufe or hurted. Now whan
you knowe the place of your hurt,
know also what maie do you hurt,
that you maie bee more charie of
your hurter. You se ones, the place
wherin you maie be hurted, is your
secrete mynde, a veraie sure place.
For it is not fyre, nor water, nor
thefe, that can come there, it is noo
prynces sworde, that can perce into
this place, it is no mislucke of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
that can light vpon your spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite:
fynally there is noo dyuell of
helle, that can fasten a stroke vpon
you, to dooe you in this place any
hurt. This shulde be a great glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse
vnto you, to consider, in how
stronge a towre you bee frome all
hurte: but see than againe, who it
is that maie hurte you. For surely


<pb n="77" facs="tcp:10189:77"/>
you can not bee hurted but of one,
in whome is power to do hurt: this
is your owne freewill. This will
of yours, and nothyng elles, hath
power to hurte you. Se shortly in
ensaumple, howe your landes bee
taken from you, you be spoyled of
your goodes, fyre burneth vp your
house, you bee haled to prison, you
be beten, you bee torne with whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pes,
you bee drawen vpon the rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes,
you lye in chaines, you come
forthe to open shame, you suffer
colde, you be gnawen with hunger
and thirst, fynally you be putte to
deathe. What of all this: yet I
can not saie, that you be hurted: I
se, that with al this the fauour and
grace of god maie continue with
you, as it dyd with the holy marty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res.
And also before Christis passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
holly Job suffred all this, and


<pb facs="tcp:10189:78"/>
was not hurted. This is a greatte
comfort for you, to se that nothing
can hurt you, but onely your owne
self. This is the high grace of god,
that so hath made man to bee ouer
all a myghty conquerour, that can
take no hurt but of him selfe Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
I truste you will liue euer safe
and sounde. For I will not thinke,
that euer you will be so mad, as to
hurte your selfe. Than for these
trifles of the bodye and worlde,
take noo care: it is neither the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conde
thing, nor the thyrde thyng,
that can be so vnto you, that in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of theim you can bee hurted.</p>
                  <p>Marie take hede lest by the displea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sures
done in the second and in the
thyrde, you of madnes take occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
to be hurted, and willingly hurt
your selfe in the fyrste thynge, the
which only is the place, where you


<pb n="78" facs="tcp:10189:78"/>
maie bee hurted. And none besyde
your owne will hath power to hurt
you there: as if in the tyme of the
losse of worldly goodes, you wyll
fret in anger, you will dispise god,
you wil curs &amp; ban, you wil enforce
to be auenged, you crie out in fury
&amp; madnes: now take you thought
and care. for surely you be hurted,
and your cheife iewel hath a great
losse. For god withdraweth frome
your soule a greatte parte of his
grace: so that this hurte you do to
your owne selfe by this froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes.
Likewise whilest your bodie
is tourmented, either with sicknes
or otherwise: if you therfore forsake
pacience, and swell in wrothe: you
be than hurted in dede, but of none
other person beside your selfe one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
Thus you maie take from the

esteme lyfe, whan the tyme requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
either to die with honour, or
to liue with shame. These men and
suche other woulde shewe you the
waie to go to deathe, longe before
deathe came to you. But none of
all the painymes canne either with
worde or with ensaumples of their
actes declare this thyng soo truely
and effectually, as maie he that is
exercised in Christes philosophie, a
Paule, or a Peter, or a Hierom
shulde here in speake more lyuely:
than all the subtylle clerkes of the
olde grekes. Yet to me, for my part,
it is an harde thyng, either to plaie
with you one of this sort, or of that
sort. It passeth my power to speake


<pb facs="tcp:10189:83"/>
to you either like Socrates, or like
Chrisostome. So that if the saied
excepcions bee with you admitted
in a promisse makyng, I maie true<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly
denie you the performaunce of
my grauntyng, in as muche whan
I promised you this thyng, there
was vnderstanded, if I could, and
if it were conuenient: I nother can
wel declare this waie of diyng, nor
yet me thynke, it is not conuenient
for me, liuing in this co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon course
of the worldely folke, to speake of
deth so ernestly, as a monke of the
Charter house shoulde and myght
dooe. But bycause I knowe your
importune desire, to be so set vpon
this thing that nedes you wil haue
me saie somewhat herein: I will
praie you so to reade me, as the tale
not onely to bee wrytten of me for
you, but that I my selfe am also an


<pb n="83" facs="tcp:10189:83"/>
auditour of the same, and as mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saile,
that in my saiynge I aduise
you, as thoughe the holle woorke
pertained onely to my selfe, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
take this note for your comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.
that I write nothyng to you,
that I wyshe not were in my owne
power to execute. Thus I with
you, and you with me bothe of vs
fast yoked to gethers, let vs ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
our selfes to be in dede suche
men as we commende and praise.
For as it is shame to speake one
thyng and to thynke an other, soo
it is a more shame to write holyly
and to lyue worldly. And as great
a rebuke there is in hym that can
here and praise good saiynges but
doo there after he will not. Nowe
than let vs not speake onely of the
waie to die well, but in effecte lette


<pb facs="tcp:10189:84"/>
vs indeuer our mindes to haue the
frute of this lesson, to make in dede
a good ende of our lyfe. And here
nowe without any further proces
I will begin to paie you my dette,
and shortelye you shall knowe my
minde howe you maie die well.</p>
                  <p>¶As I was bethynkyng me, to

hym to faile out for a certaine
cause with the saied tiraunte, and
many sore woordes were betwene
theim: at the laste whan the tone

was departyng frome the tother,
this emperour in his fiers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Canius turned him with low cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tesy
and saied: My mooste gentill
prynce I hertely thanke you.</p>
                  <p>¶This answere came from a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
stomacke, whereby he shewed
the madde rages of the cruell ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raunt
to be soo farre intollerable,
that vnder hym deathe was to be
reckened for a benefit and a good
tourne: wherfore he thanked hym
for his offer, as for a specially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde.
And great maruaile men
had to beholde this Philosopher,
howe merie he was after this ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantes
thretenyng. There were .x.
daies gyuen of respite, before he
shoulde die the whiche tyme he soo


<pb facs="tcp:10189:85"/>
passed, that he neuer semed to be in
lesse care, nor to haue his mynde in
better quietnes.</p>
                  <p>¶Whan the daie came of execuci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
the kynges geyler and hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
wente about the towne with a
great company of them that shuld
suffer deathe, the whiche passinge
by this Canius house, they called
hym to bee broughte also forthe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongeste
the other, at the whiche
tyme Canius was plaiyng at the
chestes with one of his company<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and hearing them make hast,
he rose and telled his men, saiyng
to his companion: Loke now that
after my deathe you lye not, nor
make noo faulse crakes, that you
haue won this game. There with
also he bekenyd to the geyler and
saied: I praie you beare witnes,
that I haue one man in this game


<pb n="85" facs="tcp:10189:85"/>
more than my felowe hath.</p>
                  <p>¶In this wyse this philosopher
plaied with death, and shortly his
quiete herte gaue a fouie checke
mate to the tyrauntes crueltie: he
shewed hym selfe to be in spirite as
farte aboue all kinges violent po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer,
as these mighty prynces think
to haue a stronge dominyon ouer
all theyr subiectes. The frendes
and familiars of this philosopher
were veraie sorowfull, bewailyng
the losse of suche a man, to whome:
what meane you quoth he? why
be you sad? why mourne you for
me? Is hit not youre studye to
knowe, whether the soule of man
be mortal or immortal? The trouth
of this harde question I now shall
learne: and nowe shall I see the
trouth of all our doubtes of heuen
and of god.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10189:86"/>¶Thus talking with his frendes
he came to the place of execucion,
and there a lyttell, whyleste other
were headded, he stode styl in a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>syng
dumpte. What thynke you
nowe good Canius, quoth one of
his frendes? Where vppon nowe
muse you so ernestly: Mary (quoth
he) I haue determined with my self
to marke wel, whether in this short
pange of death my soule shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue

my bodie. This pointe I fully en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tende
to take hede of: and if I can,
I will surely brynge you and the
rest of my felowes worde, what I
felte, and what is the state of our

                  <p>¶Here was a wonderfull caulme

that was not only to the death stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
of knowladg, but also in the
selfe death founde occasion of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng.
It was not possible for any
mans minde to continue his studie
longer, or to a further pointe than
this noble philosopher dyd.</p>
                  <p>¶This storie and certaine other
like, maken me often to reson with
my selfe, what a strength of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladge
is in mans braine, to serche
and to finde by hym selfe the truth,
if he enforce his wittes to learne.
For this Canius and many other
were not taught of Christe, as we
nowe be, they had not the rules of
faith, the which shewe the vndoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulle
waie to come to the perfytte
knowladge of all priuie misteries,
they were not comforted with the
preachyng of goddis son to set lyt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell

the thyng, as muche as shalbe

and fyrst if death were by hym selfe
good, it shoulde be no trespasse for
one man to kyll hym selfe or an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For in giuing to other a good
thynge or in takynge to our selfe a
good thynge, can bee noo rebuke.
Where the dede is good, there is

not onely by Christes teachynge,
but also by naturall reason man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>slaughter

Nor yet it coulde not be, that

the whiche couragyously toke v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
theim not death. And surely it
shoulde not be the naturall ende of
mans course in this life, if it were a
thing, by it selfe naught. For euill
magrie mans heade, is neuer put
to him, as it shuld be yf death were
euyll: the whiche necessariely man
is constrained to suffer. Therfore
it semeth true, that deathe conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
alone by it selfe, is nother good
nor euill.<note place="margin">Deathe is nother good nor euill.</note> But whan we here of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng

deathe by it selfe that is spoken of,
but rather the circumstances, the

or that goeth before death, or that


<pb facs="tcp:10189:99"/>
foloweth death. These be the thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
that gyuethe and takethe this
name of goodnes or euilnes, As to
saie that deathe is good, bycause it
endeth this sinneful life, and is the
meane to passe from this worlde to
heauen: or els whan we saie, that
Iudas died an euil death, it is not
ment that the departing of Iudas
soule from the bodie was euill, but
the maner of his diyng, was the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill
thyng, his cursed desperacion,
his dampnable mistrust of goddis
mercy, his dispitful refusing grace,
made his death euil. The two the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues,
he at the ryght hande, and he
at the lefte, bothe died one kinde of
death, both nailed to crosses, bothe
woorthy for their trespasses: yet it
is trouthe, that the tone died well
in a good deathe, the tother died
naughte in an euill deathe, not for


<pb n="99" facs="tcp:10189:99"/>
the deathe by it selfe, wherin was
no difference, but for the diuersitee
of their .ii. mindes in takynge of
death. The tone repented him, and
asked mercie, wherof he died graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouslye,
the tother continued in his
blaspheming god, the whiche stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne
stomacke in sinne caused him
to die vngraciously. It is a thing
that foloweth death, and is not in
deathe it selfe, whervpon we loke,
whan we iudge to bee a good ende
or an euil. For by the maner of him
that dieth, we coniecture the state
and condicion of the soule: the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
if we finde in our fantasie to be
in an euill case, as in the daunger
of goddes curse, we calle deathe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uil,
wherby the soule passed to com
to suche sorowe. And contrarie, if
we thinke the soule to be in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
of god, or to bee redie to take


<pb facs="tcp:10189:100"/>
mercie we call death good, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
conueied the soule to his blys.
So that by it self death remaineth
indifferent to be iudged of diuers
consideracions, other a good ende
or an euill ende.</p>
                  <p>¶Now than we maie here saie, he
that feareth deathe,<note place="margin">To feare deathe.</note> shewethe him
selfe to bee in doubte of his soules
state, or els to be certaine that his
soule is in goddis curse. The whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
fearefull minde is in them that
haue soo passed this presente life,
that either thei haue doen nothing,
wherby thei maie hope to be rewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

so vngraciously, that thei can haue
no trust of escaping damnable pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishement,
specially if he be a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stened

life and deathe passe without care.
For life is not good, but to liue wel
is good.</p>

death is so common a thyng daiely

fere: thinges that be euer at hande
shuld by their familiaritee and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome
nousell vs to sette littell by
them. Furthermore he that feareth
death comyng to hym, wolde feare
by lykelyhode death, if it coulde be
with hym, whan deathe is suche a
thing, that other it is not yet come,
or els it is paste. For noo man can
saie, that death is present. So this
feare can neuer be ioyned with the
thing that is feared. Againe that
thyng that euery man maie do, no
man lightly dothe, that thyng that
no man can helpe him selfe in, that
for the moste parte all men do. No
man almost studieth or careth how
well he maie liue, but howe longe


<pb n="102" facs="tcp:10189:102"/>
he maie liue euerye man musethe,
whan the trouthe is, that it might
of all men be optained to liue wel,
and noo man can further him selfe
to liue longe. A like frowardenes
is in our remembraunce of deathe,
we busilye labour and enforce to
dreame of deathe, the whiche thing
we can not do: we might finde the
waie to die well, and this thing we
will not do. This madnes John<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I

                  <p>¶Amonge many commoditees of
death I reken one cheifely to be set
by, that it is good to die well, to es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
therby the occasion of liuinge
euill, and surely he dieth well, that
for suche an intente taketh deathe

                     <pb facs="tcp:10189:103"/>¶More ouer consider you well,
and you shall see, that in hym the
whiche is curious to lyue, fortune
hath a great rule, but in hym that
can die gladdely, fortune hath noo
power. And what a wretchednes it
is to be vnder fortunes vanitee, I
reporte me to theim, whome we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holde
daiely diuersly vexed as wel
with immoderate lustes of to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
welth, as with passing sorowes
of to muche trouble. Therfore to
be out of fortunes thraldome sette
littell by this lyfe, that is to saie,
feare not deathe.</p>
                  <p>¶It pleased me to reade a paini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
opinion, that saied. He is as
foolishe that feareth deathe, as he
that feareth to be olde. For as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
young age foloweth the old: so
after olde age streighte folowethe
deathe. And a madde mans pointe


<pb n="103" facs="tcp:10189:103"/>
it is to feare deathe, seyng thinges
vncertain, the whiche maie chance
and maie not chance, bee only wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie
of feare, but thing certain with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
doubt comming, must be loked
for, not feared. The necessitee of
deathes comminge is equalle and
without remedie, soo that other to
complaine, or to flee at deathe it is
a plaine maddenes. For who can
complaine to be in the condicion, in
the whiche indifferently all men of
this worde be?</p>
                  <p>¶And againe if the paine of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
were a thinge to make deathe
fearefull, firste it shoulde be a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte
to remembre, that after the
paine of deathe, there shall bee noo
more paine, and as Epicure saith,
If it be an extreme sore paine, it is
shorte. For no vehement paine can
bee longe. This were enoughe to


<pb facs="tcp:10189:104"/>
make death not muche to be cared
for. Euerie waie deathe is a thing
neuer to bee feared of a wise man,
and neuer to be out of minde bothe
with good men and wise men. And
as for the feare of deathe were not

the whiche you desire. And hereof
is made a glad diyng, the whiche
I still name a good diyng. Thus
if we can take this feare a waie, we

bothe to auaunce his frende, and
to vndoo his foo: this man I saie
that gloriethe in his fantasye for
these and suche other thinges, can
not but with muche sorowe depart
hense. To this mans herte the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of death is a euer gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous
thought, his minde can not
but lament whan he seeth the neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitee
to be pluckid and drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from
these commoditees, in the whiche
resteth the ioye, pleasure and glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
of his minde, he hath soo sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fastlie
accustomed him selfe to take
this worlde for heauen, that it will
not synke in his braine, to hope of
an other heauen: he hath so corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his taste with thinking this life
to be swete, that nedes it must be a
bytter thing to make an ende of all
his pleasures, and in this case bee
not onely thei that haue this world


<pb facs="tcp:10189:111"/>
at their will, but also thei be in the
same case that haue naughte, and
be gredie of hauing. As muche lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
he this worlde that woulde
faine be riche, as he that is riche. It
is not the hauing nor the lackynge
of abundance in goodes, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth
a sorowful hert in the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of death, but it is the minde
that valureth and pondreth these
presente goodes to bee of a greatte
price, and worthie to be taried for.
This minde I saie as wel in a com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>muner,
as in a kynge, as well in a
yoman as in a lorde, as well in an
hermite, monke, or frier, as in a
marchant plowman or vacabund,
as well in beggars, as in riche me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
is the thyng that causeth sorowe in
diyng. And gladly no man dieth,
that loueth the welthe of this life.
Wherfore the learning to die well


<pb n="111" facs="tcp:10189:111"/>
requireth necessarie a lesson, howe
much the goodes of this worlde be
worthie to be regarded. And let the
truthe haue in your stomacke his
place, so that if it be true, that the
thinges of this life be worthy to be
loued and to bee cared for: thanne
loue you them and care for theim.
If the truthe be other wise, change
your minde, and nother loue these
saied thinges, nor care for theim.
Of the truth in this matter no ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
can doubte, that beleueth Christe,
whom if you thinke to be god, you
muste also thinke it all trouth that
he saithe. It can not bee otherwise
than Christe testifieth, whose prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching
euer exhorteth vs to wilfull
pouertee, the whiche is nother to
loue y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> goods of this world though
we haue them nor to care for them,
though we haue them not: onely


<pb facs="tcp:10189:112"/>
by Christes teachynge we shoulde
care for the kingdom of heuen, the
whiche standethe in the cleanes of
conscience, where euer is a place
and a seate for the hie maiestee of
the holy trinitee. All other thinges
necessarie for this life be not to bee
cared for, nor yet to bee valured
more than their dignitees requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth:
that is to saie, no more than
is conueniente for instrumentes
and tooles to the pylgrimage and
passage of this straunge countrey.
For in this worlde wee haue noo
home, our father dwellethe not in
this region we be in this life out of
our propre countrey, we shuld hast
homewarde to the ioyfull presence
of our owne father, that abidethe
vs in heauen, the whiche hathe a
greatter charge ouer vs his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
here, than he hathe ouer the


<pb n="112" facs="tcp:10189:112"/>
beastes or birdes, the which by his
only prouision without their care,
lacketh nothing for their necessitie.
Muche more (saithe oure maister
Christ) if we tourned al our care to
godward, we shuld not be destitute
of suche thinges as necessarily this
presente life nedethe. And where
Christ so streightly commaundeth
almes dedes, saiyng, that who soe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
helpeth not a poore man in his
nede, he will not helpe him nor yet
knowe hym at the fearefull daie of
dome, in so muche that it pleaseth
Christ to say, that euery poore man
representeth the person of goddes
son, so that he that regardeth not a
poore man, dispiseth the son of god.
In this doctrine what thinke you?
Whether dothe Christ commaund
almes deades for the poore mans
sake, that shoulde take almes, or


<pb facs="tcp:10189:113"/>
for the riche mans sake, that shuld
giue almes? In takynge almes I
fynde noo vertue and nedes it is a
thing partainyng to vertue, that
Christ wolde haue done. Therfore
surely it is for the riche mans sake.
For it is Christes lesson, that tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth
vs to haue noo inwarde loue
to these casuall good<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s, the whiche
we muste put from vs, where we se
them that want such thinges. And
a profe of a perfect stomacke is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in him, that vtterlie leauethe
and forsaketh al this worlde to fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowe
Christe: the whiche byddeth
the riche man, that wil be perfecte,
to go and sell all that he hath, and
deale all to poore men. For as hard

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:10189:113"/>
for a rich man to be saued,
but because it is harde for a man in
a welthy state to kepe his minde in
a due order to godwarde, without
beyng drowned or infected by the
contagious lustes and corrupted
pleasures, the whiche foloweth the
fortunate life of this worlde. And
nothinge is more in a riche man to
be feared, than lest he set his minde
to loue his riches, the whiche loue
can neuer stande with the pleasure
of god. Remembre the saiyng of the
apostell sainct Paule: The loue of
riches is the rote of all sin. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
let not this loue grow in your
herte, from whense shoulde spring

all the commoditees appertayn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge

saithe, The losynge of life in this

sorowe, peine, tribulacion, pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,

                  <p>¶Contrarie the same maister te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stifieth,
that mirthe, welthe, reste,

slaunder, miserie, weakenes,
thraldome, bondage, and finally
deathe in goddes reigne. In this
tenour and key sowneth al our ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

it is enough to proue to a Christe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned


<pb n="114" facs="tcp:10189:114"/>
man, that the welthye state of
this worlde is vayne and ieoper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous,
because Christe so teachethe
and precheth, and surely a greater
profe by reson for this matter with
you I will not use at this time. Let
Christe bee beleued, that biddethe
you gether a treasure in heauen,
where your riches shall be sure fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
mothes, wormes, and rusting, from
theues, fier, and water. If your
treasure be ones couched in heuen,
streighte your herte shall also bee

For the iudges of these worldely

to giue sentence according.
In like maner therfore I require
the secounde place and audience of

long heretofore ꝓsecuted his cause.
This aduersarie of mine is the ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
opinion of longe time with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
men, that wandereth throughe
the worlde, and confirmeth, that al
thinges be confused and troubled,
so that amongest men nothing can
be iustly and well kept, nothing in
right order. Daily we se many men
hurted troubled &amp; oppressed with
all sortes of wronges and iniuries:
Feble and weake persons be ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwen
by the strong and mighty:
the simple and poore folke bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done
by the richer: and as possible
it is to tell the waues of the sea, as
to reherse al them that suffre wro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g
and bee offended, whom no lawes


<pb facs="tcp:10189:122"/>
no fere of iudges doth helpe. This
noyful pestilence no power can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siste,
but rather daiely the teares,
the sighes, the lamenting of men,
bewailing their wronges and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,
growe more and more. For the
iudges, to whom is giuen auctori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
to redresse &amp; amend these wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
bee thei that cause mo greues
thei that sturre vp greatter mische<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues.
And nowe this faulte is soo
farre passed and growen, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
vnfortunate persons and vaine
fooles breake out into suche mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
that they blame for this disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Prouidence and wisedome
of god, specially whan thei behold
a man that liuethe an honeste and
quiete life, to be drawen to the law,
to be cast in prison, to be vexed and
troubled, and to suffer the extreme
rigour and crueltee: on the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie


<pb n="122" facs="tcp:10189:122"/>
parte thei see a froward person,
an vngracious liuer, a man set v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon
mischeife to be at ease, to waxe
riche, to come to highe promocion,

he that hath it, cannot lose it
by noo mans violence, nor yet by
the diuels, excepte he him selfe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy
it. Our aduersarie the diuell
knewe well this order and degree
of thinges, and therfore whan he
assauted the blessed man Iob, he
destroyed all his substaunce, not to


<pb facs="tcp:10189:127"/>
make hym poore, but that he agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
with so great losse, shuld speke
some wordes of blasphemy against
god, and for the same self cause the

not that he shoulde be sicke, where<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>of

Iobs bodie with more cruelle

he had bene rent with the violente

For no nailes nor flesheho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:10189:127"/>
of that holy man, as the finde dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

therfore all these peinfull sorowes
he caste vppon Iob, to make hym
thinke somwhat amisse of god, with<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>out
the whiche pointe Iob coulde
not bee hurted. To this purpose
Iobs frendes that came to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forte
him, were by the finde picked
to prouoke greuouslye Iob, and
thei saied to hym, O Iob, thou art
not yet punished according to the
greattenesse of thy trespasses and
weighte of thy synnes. And many
suche wordes thei spake and accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
hym. But the blessed Iob, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated
and spoiled of citee, of house,
of goodes, of seruauntes, of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
had for his palaice a dunge

the blessed man Iob is not onely
by these meanes nothyng hurted,
but also by this persecucion he is
made better, more noble, and of
higher dignitee. For where the find
had spoyled him of all his goodes,
and also of al bodily case and helth
there blessed Iob, through his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience,
gathered infinite riches of
vertue. Nor he was not with god

To this I tell the, The di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uel

hurted not Adam, but his own
frailnes and sluggishenes hurted
him whilest he regaded not the kep<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>yng

For this finde that came so armed
with so many weapons and decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes

and ouercome him. Howe coulde
he by any meanes haue deceiued

hurted and destroyed hym selfe?
But again thou saiest. what than?
A man betraied &amp; accused of back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters
loseth all his substance and

is spoyled of all his patrimonie, of

onely he is not hurted, but he shall


<pb n="129" facs="tcp:10189:129"/>
haue here of great aduantage and
gaines, if he bee diligent and take
good hede. For I praie the tel me,
in what pointe dyd the pouertee of
Christe hurte the apostles? Liued
not they in hunger, in thrist, poore
and naked? and yet hereby they
grewe more noble, and were more
glorious, and optemed a greatte
hope and truste in god by their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie.
Dyd not syckenes, scabbes,
extreme wretchedenes, nede, and
pouertie bringe Lazar to the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
life: and for his vexacion and
troubles in this worlde, was not
he crowned in the euerlasting ioye:
What shall we saie of Ioseph? was
not he continually sclandered and
rebuked, both at home in his owne
countrey and forth: in so much that
he was punished for an aduoutrer,
and driuen from his kynne, house,


<pb facs="tcp:10189:130"/>
and all acquaintance: is not he for
these thinges in great honour with
al men, and with god in great glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie?
But why doo we reherse, that
by banishementes, by rebukes, by
bondages, by prisonmentes, holy
men came to great glorie? I praie
the shewe me, deathe it selfe, what
hurte dyd it to the moste iuste and
blessed Abell? I saie, that bytter
and cruell deathe, committed of no
straunger but of his own naturall
brother? Is not Abel for this thing
celebrated &amp; worshipped throughe
all this worlde? Thou seeste howe
my processe declareth more than I
promissed, for it doth not only ope<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
that no man is hurted of an other
beside him selfe, but also that holy
men take infinite gaines and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites
in these thynges, by the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
they seme to bee euill handled.


<pb n="130" facs="tcp:10189:130"/>
Here thou saiste, what nedeth soo
many peines, so many punishmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes?
What nedeth hell, and so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thretninges, if it be true, that no
man hurteth, nor noo man is hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
Here me to this, peruerte not,
nor mingle not my tale. For I said
not, that noo man hurteth: but I
saied, that no man is hurted of an
other. Againe thou saist, howe can
this be, that some shall hurte, and
yet no man bee hurted? It maie be
as I haue shewed, for his own bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne
hurted Ioseph, and did wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly
againste him: but Iosephe
him selfe was not hurted. And
Caine did wickedly against Abell,
whan he laide in wait to slaie him:
yet Abell him selfe was not hurted
nor suffred noo parte of euill. To
this purpose seruethe peines and
punishementes. For the vertue of


<pb facs="tcp:10189:131"/>
pacience in theim that suffre, dothe
not take away the trespasse of them
that with an vngracious entente
set vpon other, and do wrongful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.
For all bee it that they by their
pacience bee made more glorious:
yet the other bee not redemed of
their miscsheife in their malicious
purpose. And therfore the vertue
and noblenes of minde auaunceth
the sufferer to honour, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious
stomacke drowneth the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers

that without repentance, persecute

ponder and way thou, the rewarde
and glorye that shall bee gyuen the

for these wronges. For he that wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly

of his trespasses and synnes,
but also he opteynethe thereby the
merytes and the rewardes due to
vertue and goodnes: so hygh and
great a thing it is to kepe stedfast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
an assured and full faith in god.
Than seing that nother the losse of
goodes and substaunce, nor sclan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
nor defyaunce, nor banysshe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
nor sickenesse, nor tormentes,
nor deathe it selfe, that semethe the
most greuous thing of all the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said,
can hurt men, but more rather
helpe and do good to men, in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
vs better &amp; worthy of so great
reward, howe and wherof shall we
proue any man to be hurted, whan
of none of these sayd greues a man
can be hurted? But I will nowe as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say


<pb facs="tcp:10189:133"/>
to lay plainly before thine eies,
that they only be hurted, the which
do hurt, and that the hurt, the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
thei do, noieth not, nor toucheth
not none other persone, but onely
them self that inforceth to hurt. For
tell me, what can now be more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
than Caine? The death, by
the whiche he with his owne han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
slewe his propre brother, hath
made Abell for euermore a saincte
and gloriouse martyre, and hathe
caused the slear for euermore to be
taken for a wicked mankyller, and
that against his owne bloud. Also
what is more wretched than that
Herodis wife? the which desired to
haue S. John<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s head in a dishe, that
hir owne head shuld be drowned in
the euerlasting flames of burning
hell. What is in worse case then the
dyuell hym selfe the whiche by his


<pb n="133" facs="tcp:10189:133"/>
malice made the holly Iob waxed
nobler, so muche grew and increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the diuels peine. I thinke thou
nowe seest, that my tale hath shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
much more tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I promised. For
it is open and plaine, not only how
no man is hurted of theim that do
wronge, but also that the hurters
and none els bee hurted and suffre
euill. For nother riches, nor liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,
nor noblenes, nor helthe, nor
life, nor suche other thinges be the
propre goodes and substaunce of
man, that hath nothynge proprely
his owne, but onely the vertue of
minde. And therfore whan in these
outwarde thynges, other hurte or
losse, or trouble happeneth, man is
not hurted, seeyng all his treasure
is in the saied vertue of mind. Here
thou askest, what if a man be hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the saied vertue? It can not


<pb facs="tcp:10189:134"/>
be but thus. If any be hurted ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
he is hurted of none other perso<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,
but only of him<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>self. Thou desirest
to here how a man is hurted of him
selfe. Wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he is beaten of somme o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
or robbed and spoiled of his
goods, or by any meanes troubled,
if than he speke any opprobrious
word, any vnpacient sentence, he is
hurted, yea and soore hurted: &amp; yet
(I saie) not of an other, but of hym<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>selfe,
through his own lacke of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cience.
For as it is saied before, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
what the blessed Iob suffered,
not of any man, but of him that pas<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sed
the al men in mischefe and cruel<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tee.
That if he, that blouddie tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentour
the diuell, that haynouse
kaitife, with so many ingins, so ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ny
craftes, so many peines, culd no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing
preuaile in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>straining Iob
to trespasse with his tong before the


<pb n="134" facs="tcp:10189:134"/>
face of God, speciallye whan Iob
had neuer hearde the lawe of God,
nor had not parte of the redempci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the glorious resurrection of
our sauiour Christe: If the blessed
Iob I saie, lackyng this ayde of
Christes passion, was able to resist
all the findes malice: howe muche
more thou christen man art able to
withstand al stormes. If thou wilt
vse and exercise thy power, &amp; take
ayde and succour of thy faith, it is
not possible for the to be ouercome.
For beholde S. Paule howe mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

thou desyre to worke mercy, and to

Pouertie letteth not a man to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyse

though thou be poore, thou shalte
haue. ii. mytes, or one fardyng, the
whiche whan thou haste offered, it
shalbe reckened to the aboue al the

thou bee poore, thou haste anne

                  <p>Now than tell me I praie the, why

For me thinke I must of riches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin

it apereth to many men, that
riches for our helth, life, name, and
fame, and the state of our countrey,
bee more commodious than other
frendes, kinsmen, ye than all other
thinges that be. This goodly and
semely sentence is not onely obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued
bothe by the sea and lande, but
is nowe mounted vppe aboue the
clowdes to the sterres. I knowe
well that this reason is not so mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che
a sounde of wordes, as it is a
bourninge flame and fire, that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroieth
the hole world, and no man

                     </gap>e it.
For all sortes of men fauoure this
mischeife and praise of riches, not
onely they that be partakers ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
but they also that yet bee not
come therto. Thou maiest se euery
kinde of men, whether it be man or
woman, seruaunt or maister, riche
or poore, to the vttermoste that he
can, helpethe to increase this fire,
and caste some mattier thervpon,
labouring in it bothe by daye and
night: all I saie, bring to this fire
plentie of mattier, plentie of fag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gottes,
not of wod, nor strawe, nor
hey: for this kinde of fire consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth
no suche mattier, but thei cast

couetous riche men, though it wer
possible for eche of theim to haue in
possession the hole earth, yet neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theles
they wolde bourne in their
desire and appetite to haue more.
And poore men likewise, whileste
they couete to be equall with riche
men, they bee tourmoyled with an
incurable furie, thei be madde, they
be wode, they rage, they raue: and

For as swine thei reioice to tumble

in this parte their misbehauour is

saied vnreasonable vile and brute
beastes, that tumble and walow in

they wante perceiuance wytte and

from the stynche and filthe of this


<pb facs="tcp:10189:141"/>
worldly myre. Nowe than harken,
and as men shulde answere me, tell
me, why semethe ryches worthy to
be loued and folowed? There is
no doubt, your answere is, that ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
be coueted, fyrst for the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure
of life and welth of body: secon<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>darily
for the honor that is in this
lyfe. And for offices, dignities, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions
that be gyuen to men for
theyr riches. Ferthermore, thirdly
bycause the ryche man may sone be
auenged, may sone bewreke his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre
vpon theym that do hym any
wronge or displeasure, and that he
may be feared of other, as a man of
power. I thinke thou hast no cause
to allege besyde these foresaid, that
is to saie, beside pleasure, honour,
offices feare and auengeance. For
ryches can not make a man nother
better nor soberer, nor more mercy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,


<pb n="141" facs="tcp:10189:141"/>
nor wiser, nor yet make a man
softe, quiet, and gentill, nor final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
riches neuer teachethe an hastye
man pacience, an outragious, man
continency, a drunkarde sobrenes,
a shamlesse person shamefastnes,
nor none other kinde of vertue is
opteined by richesse, no vice nor sin
is tourned into the better by riches.
So than if riches preuail nothing
to the gettyng, or to the increasing
of the goodnesse in the sowle and
minde, nor they make not a man in
vertu better, tell me I pray the, for
what cause shuld riches be desired?
Ye contrarye wyse this is trouthe,
that riches doth not onely nothing
preuaile for vertue, but also whan
they ones come into the mynde, yf
thei finde any thing toward good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse,
and mete for vertue, they vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
distroy and corrupt the same,


<pb facs="tcp:10189:142"/>
and in the stede and place of vertu,
they bryng in vice and syn. For the
handemaides and folowers of ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
be bodily lustes, sensuall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petues,
lechery, angre, gluttonye,
intempetancy, fury, wronge, pride,
bostinges, and all beastly and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable
mocion. But let vs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre
the speakyng of these enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyes
to an nother place. For these
men that haue their myndes sycke
in the desyre of rychesse, wille not
gladly here communicacion of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
or of syn. For they defende lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes
and pleasure, and they will not
suffre any thinge to be saied herein
againste theim. Therfore we wyll
nowe moue this question, whether
there be any thyng in rychesse, that
maie delite and please men: or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be any honor in the same.
And here, if it please you, let vs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyn


<pb n="142" facs="tcp:10189:142"/>
from feastes, from the greate
aboundauce of meates. For in this
thynge chiefly is praysed the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence
and glorye of ryches. Let
vs in this place compare togithers
the table of a riche man, and of a
meane person, and let vs boult out
the gestes of eyther party, whether
of them take of their chere more ple<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sure.
They that sit eatyng in festis
tyll their armes be wery, and ioine
their supper to theyr dyner, and in
maner stretch their bealies till they
burst, ouerladed with the bourdein
of meate and drinke, in whose body

nor tonge, nor foote can do his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
but all theyr membres lye more
greuouser fetered with the bondes
of drinke, than men that lye in chei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,


<pb facs="tcp:10189:143"/>
to whom slepe bringeth no rest

they perceiue nothyng, thei fele no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyng,
they knowe nothynge, they
can not here nor speake, but finally
with shame they be borne from the
table to bedde. Is there than more
pleasure in suche feastes than in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
where is as muche of meate
and drinke, as is sufficient to driue
away hunger and thirste? the whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che

the table, the body is not euerchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged

speake of. But these that lyue in

buried in them. And if there be any
ioy, any pleasure or myrthe in their
lyfe: who is there that can set by it,
specially if he be one that knoweth,
what is the very ioy and pleasure?
For of wyse men pleasure<note place="margin">Pleasure.</note> is thus
defined and called. That there is
onely pleasure, where a man hathe
the franke vse of his desires. For
where a man can not vse of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires,
whilest that either sicknes let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth

For loke vpon these sicke men, how
thei loth all thinges: and although
there be neuer so delicate and swete
meates put before theim, yet they
take them rather with tediousenes,
than any lust or plesure to eate. In
lykewyse, whan by to muche abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
the luste and desire is quen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,
there also the pleasure and

saith: Whan the minde is full and

that pleasure resteth not in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture

                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:10189:145"/>Wherfore the prophete, rehersyng

Aegypte and in the wildernesse, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongest
the reste he reherseth also
this thynge: howe hunnie renning
out of the stones satisfied and filled
them. For we neuer finde that hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye

than meanethe this prophetes sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng?
that after theyr labours and
werynes in the longe iourney, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng
great thyrst, they dranke the
swete cold water that ran out of the
stones: and of that water with a
great lust &amp; desire thei tasted. And
therfore because their desire and ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>petite
of drinking was most swetly
saciated and filled, the prophet cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led

the nature of water was turned or

nor of these foresaied thinges there

is it not nowe plaine, that the sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple

Of the other part, Iudas also was

might haue ben amended,
for he was a thiefe: yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standyng

knewe well that Iudas was coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,

                  <p>¶Finallye besides this, the holly
scripture, as it were done in a large

the many liues of the olde fathers,
from Adam to the time of our mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster
Christe, that therby thou migh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>test

mightest be instructed and taught,
that except a man hurteth him self,
he can not be hurted of any other,
although the hole vniuersal world
wolde conspire and agree againste
hym, although there shoulde bee a
chaung of all times and of al thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
althoughe the furie of kynges
and princes shoulde rage againste
him, and as well frendes as foes
shoulde waite to betraie him, other
by deceit or by force, yet al this can
not moue or stur in any small iote,
the constant stomake and waking
minde in vertue. Likewise of the

and exercise all the power and will
that is in him. The same lesson we

parable, that Christ maketh of dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
builders, one that buildethe
his house vpon a sure stone: an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
that buildeth vpon the sande,

remembre other the vertu of mind,
or the negligence of the same: and
that we shuld hereby perceiue, how
except he hurteth him selfe, no man
can be hurted of an other, soo that
nother stormie raines, nor violente
renning fluddes, nor the great bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting

<pb facs="tcp:10189:154"/>
that is builded vpon a sure stone.
Wherby Christe teacheth the, that
a man, the which betraieth not him
selfe, nor is not of him selfe sturred
or troubled, no temptacion canne
moue or ouerthrowe him. But the
other buildyng is sone cast downe,
not for the violence of temptacion,
but for the weaknes of the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion,
that is the feblenes of mans
minde and purpose. For sande is a
lose thing and fletinge: the whiche
without doubte signifiethe the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablenes
and inconstancy of mind.
Wherefore the cause of the houses
ruine, is not temptacion, but the ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gligence
and the wauering of the
minde, the whiche sometime with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any blaste of temptacion is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowen,
as a buildyng that is

noo fluddes: yet the fletynge sande
causethe the holle house to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwe.
For by it selfe sande will
breake and flitte: but the harde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damante
stone can not bee broken
with hammers. Soo than he that
is not of him selfe hurted, can not
be hurted, of other, although he be
by many waies violentely assaied,
but he that by his owne myndes
slouthfulnes and negligence is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied,

yet by him selfe he falleth and is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrowen:
As that synful Iudas

This thinge I shall shewe you to

of the Iewes. Were not all other
creatures in maner ordeined and
made to serue them? was there not
giuen to them aboue all other men
certain new and exquisite lawes to
liue by? Was not a dry waie made
for them through the middes of the
sea? and in the same place where
they were in safetee, their ennemies
and persecutours were distroyed.
They liued fortee yeres in wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
without plowyng or sowing.
Thei knew not nor felt not the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of haruest, thei had no pein in

the word of god gaue theim,
and fedde theim in the wildernes,
without their labour or peine. For


<pb n="155" facs="tcp:10189:155"/>
this was the nature of <hi>Manna,</hi> it se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
daiely a new meate: and as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerie
mans appetite was, so it had
his taste. Also by the prouision of
god they lacked not clothes, hose,
or shoes. For during all the saied
yers their clothes continued in one
case, nothing worne out: no person
among them was diseased, or sick,
nor had nede of phisicke, noo man
soughte for medicines. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phete
Dauid saieth:<note place="margin">Psal. 104,</note> God brought

But as though they had lefte this

the woorde of God shyned before

giue them comfortable lyght, but
also shewed theim the right waie in

them with abundaunt yssue of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?
What should I speake of the

their clusteryng couered the holle

what shoulde I reherse? Or what

wildernes? the battailles done by
praiers, the great victories gotten
onely by the callyng of God? For
they not like men fightyng, but as
thoughe they had bene in a daunce
continually triumphed. And howe
can it be tolde, that as they passed
Aegypte, where the seas fyght for

the walles of Hiericho, in

of heauen, of erth, of all the world.
The seas that they with drie feete

and finallye all the wonders that
were done other in Aegypte, or in

These infinite miracles weere to

Tel me, howe lefte thei their life so

And whan god sawe that euery one
of them had lefte their vngracious

euidently se, how that he that hath

can not onelye take none hurte of

Contrarye wise he that betraiethe
and hurteth him selfe, although he

and helpes of almightie god to his

the knowladge of god, and hadde
their inward eies lift vp to heuen,
and could well remembre, that this

or to eate of those meates, that
were bee cursed and forbed of god:
What did than these younge chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren?
this tendre age bound in this
thraldome? They sought none ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse
in that god knew their necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,
and mighte see howe they were
constrained, beyng in the handes
of a tiranne, kepte in bondage, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing


<pb n="161" facs="tcp:10189:161"/>
no power to resiste their cruel
lorde and proude conquerour: thei
imagyned none of these excuses,
but determined vtterly with theim
selues to forbeare to the death, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that thei woulde not offende nor
displease God, or doo that thinge
that was not lefull for theim to do.
Thus they were on all sides beset
with thinges cleane resistyng and
contrary against their desire. Thei
were bare and naked of all money,
wherby thei might haue somewhat
swaged the fiersenesse of their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
and kepers: nor yet thei could
haue noo sure truste in any mans
frendeship, seyng they were aliens
and strangers, and authoritee thei
had none, beyng bonde prisoners,
nor in numbre they coulde not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaile,
beyng but three alone, what
do they than? Surely that thinge


<pb facs="tcp:10189:162"/>
that only semed to be in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
With faire wordes thei entreat
their keper, whom they founde ful
of feare, leaste he shoulde be put to
deathe, if he fauoured and applied
to their desires, and so this keper
saied to them, I sore feare my lorde
the kyng, leaste he loke vpon you,
and se your faces paler and leaner
than bee the other yonge men, and
vpon that blame me, and putte me
for your sake to deathe. But they
of the other parte, with wise aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sweres
toke from him al his feare,
and caused him to beare theim fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour.
Thus whan they had done
as muche as laie in theim, and as
muche as was possible for them to
doo, streighte the aide and succour
of god was at hande and didde for
theim his parte. Than I saie this
worke is not the woorke of god a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,


<pb n="162" facs="tcp:10189:162"/>
but the beginnynge thereof
cometh of their purpose and redie
minde. For they were fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
with theim selfe, not to taste
of the vnlefull meates. And whan
they had constantely and strongly
kept this minde, streight the becke
of almightee god confirmed them
in the same, and brought their pur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>pose
to a glorious end. Seest thou
now in this place, that who so euer
hurteth not him selfe, he can not be
hurted of an nother? For I praie
the, loke with me vpon the case of
these thre children, yonge thei wer,
in bondage, in thraldome, al alone,
there hanged ouer theim a stronge
and mightee power, cruel co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes,
feare of deathe, compulsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the tiran, and fierce thretnin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.
One the other side helpe and
succour was there none, nother of

coulde counsaile them to folow the
beste, no earthely comforte: yet in
all this heape was there nothynge
that coulde hurt theim, seyng their
owne minde and pourpose hurted
theim not. But contrarie on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
side, the chosen people of god
the Iewes, hauing on all sides soo
many aides (as I before rehersed)
so great succour and helpe of god:
yet they preuailed nothynge in the
health of their minde, only because
their owne propre sluggisshenesse,
their owne frowardenes betraied
and distroyed theim selues. But
lette vs retourne to our three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.
Thei first opteined this glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
victorie, that they were not
defoyled with foule and vnlefulle meates.
And whan the tiran was


<pb n="163" facs="tcp:10189:163"/>
in this point ouerthrowen and cast
vnder their fete, thei were brought
to great enterprises and battailes
of more honour. For a muche more
cruell constreinment, a far greater
mischiefe and heynouse condicion
was put before theim. A furneys
was set on fier, the fierce and cruel
people of the Persis clusterethe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
theim, the tiranne rageth, all
that countrey is set to disceiue and
peruerte these simple and innocent
childrene, there is ordered dyuers
and sundrie sortes of instrumentes
to sounde after the sweete consente
of musike. O a new kinde of cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee,
fier and musike is coupled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
the threttenynges of tour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes
and feare of death is ming<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>led
with pleasure. And yet all not
withstandynge, he that dothe his
endeuour and vttermoste power,


<pb facs="tcp:10189:164"/>
can not be hurted of an nother, yea
by the inforcementes of his enne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
he shal increase in glorie and
honour: as by these foresaied mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes
these children came to an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
victorie than they hadde before.
For the tiranne Nabugodonosor
bounde them and cast theim in the
saied fourneis of fier: but he could
nothyng hurte theim, but did them
passyng good, in that his fiercenes
and crueltee gotte them a greatter
crowne, and an higher rewarde.</p>
                  <p>For thei in the middes of the bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng
fornace, in the middes of the
ragyng Persis that bourned more
than the very fier in furiouse mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes,
had a noble and glorious vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie
ouer their ennemies: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng
but thre selly children and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners,
ouercame that hole nacion
with their tirannye: whose noble


<pb n="164" facs="tcp:10189:164"/>
actes and honor is songe and shall
be songe for euermore. Thus than
he that hurteth not him selfe, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
persone can not hurte him. I
will not ceasse often to repete the
title of my Sermon and summe of
my purpose. For if (as we haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
touched) nother imprisonme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t,
nor bondage, nor thraldome, nor
the losse of countrey, of all frendes
and acquaintaunce, nor an holle
hoste of enemies, nor the fier, nor
the cruell tiranne was not of suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
power to hurt thre yong chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,
beyng lefte of all aide, beyng
straungers, and brought into the
handes of their ennemies, what
thinge is there able to breake the
vertue and courage of the minde?
But thou saiest to me, God helped
and was with them, and deliuered
theim out of the fier. In likewise


<pb facs="tcp:10189:165"/>
thou oughtest, if thou fulfill thine
vttermoste endeuour, to hope and
trust to haue the aide and grace of
god. For doubtelesse God will bee
with the, if thow leaue not before
thy selfe. How be it I do not compt
the saied children happie and bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed,
because they trampilled and
walked vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the fier without hurt,
but because they wolde be bounde,
and wold be cast into the fourneis
for the laws of their countrey and
of god, the which thing contemeth
their vertue, praise, and glorie. For
by and by whan thei were throwen
in the fier, beganne their victorie,
and in that instaunt momente they
had deserued their reward, by their
assured faith and aunswere, saiyng
vnto the kyng: We nede not aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swere
the to this question: for our
god is in heauen, whome we honor


<pb n="165" facs="tcp:10189:165"/>
and serue, that maie deliuer vs out
of this bourninge ouen, and shall
deliuer vs O thou tyranne out of
thy handes, that if god will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer
vs, thou shalte well knowe,
that to thy goddes wee will neuer
bowe: nor this image of gold, that
thou settest vp, we neuer will wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship.
Of these woordes they were
crouned, and in this testimony and
faith thei hadde their rewarde and
thanke of god, in this rested their
course, the whiche thei ended in the
martyrdome of theyr confession:
But as touching that the fire was
a shamed to touche their bodyes,
and loused theyr bondes, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saking
his owne nature, refresshed
theim with the dewe of heauen in
the middes of the hotte fourneis:
This was a poynte of the grace of
god, whose pleasure was to make


<pb facs="tcp:10189:166"/>
his power be knowen by the woun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>der
and meruaille of so straunge a
thyng: but the children in this had
no vauntage, their victorie was in
their owne stedfaste confession, in
their owne constaunt and assured
faith, wherby they opteined the glo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ry
of so noble a martirdome. What
now canst thou creke against this?
althoughe thou arte banisshed thy
countreye, driuen frome thine ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queintaunce
and frendes, brought
to thraldome, to bee bounde in the
seruice of cruell maisters? All this
hapned to the saied children: thou
liuest without teachyng, withoute
instruction, w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out comfort, the said
children wer in the same case. Thou
art bounde, thou art spoiled, thou
art constrained to die: all this pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed
the saied childrene, that euer by
their passions waxed more glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.


<pb n="166" facs="tcp:10189:166"/>
And the Iewes hauing their
te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple, theyr sacrifices, the boke writ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ten
with the ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d of god, hauing al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so
Cherubin, their holy and secreate

mete for their daily sacrifices,
and hauing the prophetes, some de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>parted,
some yet aliue, the which in
structed theim in their present ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
&amp; shewed what god did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
for them, and what he had
in times past done: what he did for
them in Egipte, what in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nes:
and what also god did for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
whan they came into the place pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missed
to them. Yet al this not with
standyng, they not onely nothyng
proceded in grace and vertu, but al<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>so
in appetual witnes of their own
mischiefe and vngraciousnes, they
set vp in their churche ydols and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages
of faulse goddes, sacrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge


<pb facs="tcp:10189:167"/>
to the same bothe their owne
sons and daughters. Thus they
did in theyr temple, and also in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
places in woddes and moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
but these saied thre children,
in a straunge countrey, in the han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des
of their ennemies, vnder the
power of a cruell tiranne, throwen
into the fire, bee nothynge hurted,
and not onely that, but also take
thereof greate honour and glorye.
Nowe than to make an ende, wee
knowing and gathering these ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of exaumples out of the hollye
scripture, where be many mo, that
make to this purpose, if a man will
seke there: so that diuersly we may
see, some without all constrainte,
without all necessitee, without any
cause, to bee againste theim selfe,
and take sore hurte: some other ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
all the worlde against theim,


<pb n="167" facs="tcp:10189:167"/>
to be stedfaste in their righte waie,
and not able to be neuer so littel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moued
frome theyr vertue. Thus
whan we euidently knowe and see,
we shoulde without all doubtynge
conclude with our selfe, that if any
man be hurted, he is hurted of him selfe
although the numbre of theim
that do hurte, bee infinite, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
all in a plumpe that
dwell other in the earthe
or in the sea, wolde a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gre
to hurt: yet they
can not in no smal
point hurt him,
that is not
hurted of
hym selfe.
With this we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,
and with this
wee make here
an ende.</p>
