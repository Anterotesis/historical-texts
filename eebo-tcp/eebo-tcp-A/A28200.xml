            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere happened in my time, one Noble Speaker [Lord <hi>Verulam]</hi> who was full of gravity in his ſpeaking. His Language (where he could ſpare or paſs by a jeſt) was nobly cenſorious. No Man ever ſpake more neatly, more preſtly, more weightily, or ſuffered leſs emptineſs, leſs Idleneſs in what he uttered. No member of his Speech but conſiſted of his own gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. His Hearers could not cough or look aſide from him without loſs. He commanded where he ſpoke; and had his Judges angry and pleaſed at his devotion. No Man had their affections more in his power.

                  <head>I. Of Truth.</head>
                  <p>WHAT is <hi>Truth?</hi> ſaid jeſting <hi>Pilate,</hi> and would not ſtay for an anſwer. Certainly there be that delight in giddineſs, and count it a Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage to fix a Belief; affecting free-will in thinking, as well as in acting. And though the Sects of Philoſophers of that kind be gone, yet there remain certain diſcourſing Wits, which are of the ſame Veins, though there be not ſo much Blood in them, as was in thoſe of the Ancients. But it is not only the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty and labour, which men take in finding out of <hi>Truth;</hi> nor again, that when it is found, it impoſeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Mens thoughts, that doth bring <hi>Lyes</hi> in favour; but a natural, though corrupt Love, of the <hi>Lye</hi> it ſelf. One of the later Schools of the <hi>Grecians</hi> examineth the matter, and is at a ſtand, to think what ſhould be in it, that Men ſhould love <hi>Lyes;</hi> where neither they make for pleaſure, as with Poets, nor for Advantage, as with the Merchant, but for the <hi>Lyes</hi> ſake. But I cannot tell. This ſame <hi>Truth</hi> is a Naked and Open day-light, that doth not ſhew the Masks, and Mummeries, and Triumphs of the World, half ſo ſtately and daintily as Candle-light. <hi>Truth</hi> may perhaps come to the price of a Pearl, that ſheweth beſt by day; but it will not riſe to the price of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:94631:6"/>
a Diamond or Carbuncle, that ſheweth beſt in varied Lights. A mixture of a <hi>Lye</hi> doth ever add pleaſure. Doth any man doubt, that if there were taken out of Mens minds vain Opinions, flattering Hopes, falſe Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luations, Imaginations as one would, and the like; but it would leave the minds of a number of Men, poor ſhrunken things, full of melancholy and indiſpoſition, and unpleaſing to themſelves? One of the Fathers in great ſeverity called Poeſie, <hi>Vinum Daemonum,</hi> becauſe it filleth the Imagination, and yet it is but with the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of a <hi>Lye.</hi> But it is not the <hi>Lye</hi> that paſſeth through the mind, but the <hi>Lye</hi> that ſinketh in, and ſettleth in it, that doth the hurt, ſuch as we ſpake of before. But howſoever theſe things are thus in Mens depraved judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and affections; yet <hi>Truth,</hi> which only doth judge it ſelf, teacheth, that the enquiry of <hi>Truth,</hi> which is the love-making, or wooing of it: the knowledge of <hi>Truth,</hi> which is the preſence of it: and the belief of <hi>Truth,</hi> which is the enjoying of it, is the ſoveraign good of Humane Nature. The firſt Creature of God in the works of the Days, was Light of the Senſe; the laſt was the Light of Reaſon; and his Sabbath-Work ever ſince, is the illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of his Spirit. Firſt, he breathed light upon the face of the Matter or Chaos; then he breathed light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the face of Man; and ſtill he breatheth and inſpireth light into the face of his Choſen. The Poet that beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied the Sect, that was otherwiſe inferiour to the reſt, ſaith yet excellently well: <hi>It is a pleaſure to ſtand upon the ſhore, and to ſee Ships toſt upon the Sea; a pleaſure to ſtand in the Window of a Caſtle, and to ſee a Battel, and the adventure thereof below: but no pleaſure is comparable to the ſtanding upon the vantage-ground of Truth:</hi> (an Hill not to be commanded, and where the Air is always clear and ſerene:) <hi>and to ſee the Errors, and Wandrings, and Mists, and Tempeſts in the Vale below:</hi> So always that this proſpect be with Pity, and not with ſwelling or Pride. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is Heaven upon Earth, to have a Mans mind move in Charity, reſt in Providence, and turn upon the Poles <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

To paſs from Theological and Philoſophical <hi>Truth,</hi> to the <hi>Truth</hi> of Civil buſineſs, it will be acknowledged, even by thoſe that practiſe it not, that clear and round dealing is the honour of Mans nature, and that mixture of falſhood is like allay in Coin of Gold and Silver, which may make the Metal work the better, but it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſeth it. For theſe winding and crooked courſes are the goings of the Serpent, which goeth baſely upon the Belly, and not upon the feet. There is no Vice that doth ſo cover a Man with ſhame, as to be found falſe and perfidious. And therefore <hi>Mountaigne</hi> ſaith prettily, when he enquired the reaſon, Why the word of the <hi>Lye</hi> ſhould be ſuch a diſgrace, and ſuch an odious charge: Saith he, <hi>If it be well weighed, To ſay that a Man lyeth, is as much as to ſay, that he is a Brave towards God, and a Coward towards Men.</hi> For a <hi>Lye</hi> faces God, and ſhrinks from Man. Surely the wickedneſs and Falſhood, and breach of Faith, cannot poſſibly be ſo highly expreſſed, as in that it ſhall be the laſt Peal, to call the Judgments of God upon the Generations of Men; it being fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that when Chriſt cometh, <hi>He ſhall not find faith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth.</hi>

                  <head>II. Of Death.</head>
                  <p>MEN fear <hi>Death,</hi> as Children fear to go in the dark: And as that natural fear in Children is encreaſed with Tales, ſo is the other. Certainly the contemplation of <hi>Death,</hi> as the <hi>wages of ſin,</hi> and paſſage to another World, is Holy and Religious; but the fear of it, as a tribute due unto Nature, is weak. Yet in religious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, there is ſometimes a mixture of vanity and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition. You ſhall read in ſome of the Friers Books of <hi>Mortification,</hi> that a Man ſhould think with himſelf, what the pain is, if he have but his fingers end preſſed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:94631:7"/>
or tortured, and thereby imagine what the pains of <hi>Death</hi> are, when the whole body is corrupted and diſſolved; when many times <hi>Death</hi> paſſeth with leſs pain, than the torture of a Limb: For the moſt Vital parts are not the quickeſt of Senſe. And by him that ſpake only as a Philoſopher, and natural man, it was well ſaid; <hi>Pompa mortis magis terret, quam Mors ipſa,</hi> Groans, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions, and diſcoloured Face, and Friends weeping, and Blacks, and Obſequies, and the like, ſhew <hi>Death</hi> terrible. It is worthy the obſerving, that there is no paſſion in the mind of Man ſo weak, but it mates and maſters the fear of <hi>Death:</hi> and therefore <hi>Death</hi> is no ſuch terrible Enemy, when a Man hath ſo many attendants about him, that can win the combat of him. <hi>Revenge</hi> triumphs over <hi>Death; Love</hi> ſlights it; <hi>Honour</hi> aſpireth to it; <hi>Grief</hi> flieth to it; <hi>Fear</hi> pre-occupateth it. Nay we read, after <hi>Otho</hi> the Emperor had ſlain himſelf, <hi>Pity</hi> (which is the tendereſt of Affections) provoked many to die, out of meer compaſſion to their Soveraign, and as the trueſt ſort of Followers. Nay, <hi>Seneca</hi> adds <hi>Niceneſs</hi> and <hi>Satiety; Cogita quandiu eadem faceres; Mori velle, non tantum Fortis, aut Miſer, ſed etiam Faſtidioſus poteſt.</hi> A man would die, though he were neither valiant nor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable, only upon a wearineſs to do the ſame thing fo oft over and over. It is no leſs worthy to obſerve, how little alteration in good Spirits the approaches of <hi>Death</hi> make. For they appear to be the ſame Men till the laſt inſtant. <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> died in a complement; <hi>Livia, Conjugii noſtri memor, vive, &amp; vale.

                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:94631:7"/>
It is as natural to die, as to be born; and to a little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant perhaps the one is as painful as the other. He that dies in an earneſt purſuit, is like one that is wounded in hot blood, who for the time ſcarce feels the hurt; and therefore a Mind fixt, and bent upon ſomewhat that is good, doth avert the dolours of <hi>Death.</hi> But above all, believe it, the ſweeteſt Canticle is, <hi>Nunc dimittis,</hi> when a Man hath obtained worthy ends and expectations. <hi>Death</hi> hath this alſo; that it openeth the Gate to good Fame, and extinguiſheth Envy.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>REligion</hi> being the chief band of Humane Society, it is a happy thing when it ſelf is well contained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the true band of <hi>Unity.</hi> The Quarrels and Diviſions about <hi>Religion</hi> were Evils unknown to the Heathen. The reaſon was, becauſe the Religion of the Heathen conſiſted rather in Rites and Ceremonies, than in any conſtant belief. For you may imagine what kind of Faith theirs was, when the chief Doctors and Fathers of their Church were Poets. But the true God hath this Attribute, that he is a <hi>Jealous</hi> God, and therefore his Worſhip and <hi>Religion</hi> will endure no mixture or <hi>Partner.</hi> We ſhall therefore ſpeak a few words concerning the <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> of the <hi>Church; What are the Fruits thereof, what the Bonds, and what the Means.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Fruits of Unity</hi> (next unto the well-pleaſing of God, which is All in All) are two; the one towards thoſe that are <hi>without the Church,</hi> the other towards thoſe that are <hi>within.</hi> For the former, It is certain, that Hereſies and Schiſms are of all others the greateſt Scandals, yea, more than corruption of Manners. For as in the Natural Body, a Wound or Solution of continuity, is worſe than
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:94631:8"/>
a corrupt Humour; ſo in the Spiritual. So that nothing doth ſo much keep Men out of the Church, and drive men out of the Church as a breach of <hi>Unity:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whenſoever it cometh to that paſs, that one ſaith, <hi>Ecce in deſerto,</hi> another ſaith, <hi>Ecce in penetralibus;</hi> that is, when ſome Men ſeek Chriſt in the Conventicles of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks, and others in an outward face of a Church, that Voice had heed continually to ſound in Mens Ears, <hi>Nolite exire, Go not out.</hi> The Doctor of the Gentiles (the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of whoſe vocation drew him to have a ſpecial care of thoſe <hi>without)</hi> ſaith, <hi>If an Heathen come in and hear you ſpeak with ſeveral Tongues, will he not ſay that you are mad?</hi> and certainly it is little better, when Atheiſts and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane perſons do hear of ſo many diſcordant and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Opinions in <hi>Religion;</hi> it doth avert them from the Church, and maketh them <hi>to ſit down in the Chair of the Scorners.</hi> It is but a light thing to be vouched in ſo ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a matter, but yet it expreſſeth well the deformity. There is a Maſter of Scoffing, that in his Catalogue of Books of a feigned Library, ſets down this Title of a Book, <hi>The Morrice-dance of Hereticks.</hi> For indeed every Sect of them hath a diverſe poſture, or cringe by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which cannot but move deriſion in Worldings, and depraved Politicks who are apt to contemn holy things.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Fruit toward thoſe that are within.</hi> It is <hi>Peace,</hi> where containeth infinite Bleſſings; it eſtabliſheth Faith; it kindleth Charity; the outward peace of the Church diſtilleth into peace of Conſcience; and it turneth the Labours of Writing and Reading of Controverſies, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Treatiſes of <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>Devotion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning the <hi>Bonds of Unity,</hi> the true placing of them importeth exceedingly. There appear to be two extreams. For to certain <hi>Zelots</hi> all ſpeech of pacification is odious. <hi>Is it peace,</hi> Jehu? <hi>What haſt thou to do with peace? turn thee behind me. Peace</hi> is not the matter, but <hi>following</hi> a <hi>party.</hi> Contrariwiſe certain <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> and luke-warm perſons, think they may accommodate points
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94631:8"/>
of <hi>Religion</hi> by middle ways, and taking part of both, and witty reconcilements, as if they would make an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement between God and Man. But theſe extreams are to be avoided; which will be done, if the league of Chriſtians, penned by our Saviour himſelf, were in the two croſs clauſes thereof, ſoundly and plainly expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>He that is not with us, is againſt us:</hi> And again, <hi>He that is not against us, is with us:</hi> That is, if the points Fundamental, and of Subſtance in <hi>Religion,</hi> were truly diſcerned and diſtinguiſhed from points not meerly of Faith, but of Opinion, Order, or good Intention. This is a thing may ſeem to many a matter trivial, and done already; but if it were done leſs partially, it would be embraced more generally.</p>
                  <p>Of this I may give only this advice, according to my ſmall model: Men ought to take heed of rendring God's Church by two kinds of controverſies: The one is, when the matter of the point controverted is too ſmall and light, not worth the heat and ſtrife about it, kindled only by contradiction. For, as it is noted by one of the Fathers, <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Coat indeed had no ſeam, but the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Veſture was of divers colours;</hi> whereupon he ſaith, <hi>In veſte varietas ſit, ſciſſura non ſit;</hi> they be two things, <hi>Unity</hi> and <hi>Uniformity.</hi> The other is, when the matter of the point controverted is great, but it is driven to an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>great ſubtilty and obſcurity, ſo that it becometh a thing rather ingenious than ſubſtantial. A Man that is of judgment and underſtanding, ſhall ſometimes hear ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Men differ, and know well within himſelf, that thoſe which ſo differ, mean one thing, and yet they themſelves would never agree. And if it come ſo to paſs, in that diſtance of judgment which is between Man and Man, ſhall we not think, that God above, that knows the heart, doth not diſcern that frail Men in ſome of their contradictions intend the ſame thing, and accepteth of both? The nature of ſuch controverſies is excellently expreſſed by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the warning and precept that he giveth concerning the ſame, <hi>Devita pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fanas</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:94631:9"/>
                     <hi>vocum novitates, &amp; oppoſitiones falſi nominis ſcientiae;</hi> Men create oppoſitions which are not, and put them into new terms ſo fixed, as whereas the meaning ought to govern the term, the term in effect governeth the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. There be alſo two falſe <hi>Peaces,</hi> or <hi>Unities;</hi> the one, when the <hi>Peace</hi> is grounded but upon an implicite ignorance; for all Colours will agree in the dark: the other when it is pieced up upon a direct admiſſion of contraries in Fundamental points. For Truth and Falſhood in ſuch things, are like the <hi>Iron</hi> and <hi>Clay in the toes of Nebuchadnezzar's Image,</hi> they may cleave, but they will not incorporate.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the <hi>Means of procuring Unity;</hi> Men muſt beware, that in the procuring or muniting of <hi>Religious Unity,</hi> they do not diſſolve and deface the Laws of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and of Humane Society. There be two Swords amongſt Chriſtians, the Spiritual and Temporal; and both have their due office and place in the maintenance of <hi>Religion.</hi> But we may not take up the third Sword, which is <hi>Mahomet</hi>'s Sword, or like unto it; that is, to propagate <hi>Religion</hi> by Wars, or by ſanguinary Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to force Conſciences, except it be in caſes of overt Scandal, blaſphemy or intermixture of practice againſt the State; much leſs to nouriſh Seditions, to authorize Conſpiracies and Rebellions, to put the Sword into the peoples hands, and the like, tending to the ſubverſion of all Government, which is the Ordinance of God. For this is but to daſh the Firſt Table againſt the Second, and ſo to conſider Men as Chriſtians, as we forget that they are Men. <hi>Lucretius</hi> the Poet, when he beheld the Act of <hi>Agamemnon,</hi> that could endure the ſacrificing of his own Daughter, exclaimed;
<q>Tantum Religio potuit ſuadere malorum.</q>
what would he have ſaid, if he had known of the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre in <hi>France,</hi> or the Powder-Treaſon of <hi>England?</hi> He would have been ſeven times more Epicure and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:94631:9"/>
Atheiſt than he was: For as the Temporal Sword is to be drawn with great circumſpection in caſes of <hi>Religion;</hi> ſo it is a thing monſtrous, to put it into the hands of the common people. Let that be left unto the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts, and other Furies. It was great blaſphemy, when the Devil ſaid, <hi>I will aſcend and be like the higheſt;</hi> but it is greater blaſphemy to perſonate God, and bring him in, ſaying, <hi>I will deſcend and be like the Prince of Darkneſs;</hi> And what is it better, to make the cauſe of <hi>Religion</hi> to deſcend to the cruel and execrable actions of Murthering Princes, Butchery of People, and Subverſion of States and Governments? Surely this is to bring down the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, inſtead of the likeneſs of a Dove, in the ſhape of a Vulture or Raven; and to ſet out of the Bark of a Chriſtian Church, a Flag of a Bark of Pyrates and <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaſſins.</hi> Therefore it is moſt neceſſary, that the Church by Doctrine and decree, Princes by their Sword, and all Learnings both Chriſtian and Moral, as by their Mercury Rod, do damn and ſend to Hell for ever thoſe Facts and Opinions, tending to the ſupport of the ſame, as hath been already in good part done. Surely in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils concerning <hi>Religion,</hi> that Counſel of the Apoſtle would be prefixed, <hi>Ira hominis non implet juſtitiam Dei.</hi> And it was a notable obſervation of a wiſe Father, and no leſs ingeniouſly confeſſed, <hi>That thoſe which held and perſwaded preſſure of Conſciences, were commonly intereſſed therein themſelves for their own ends.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>REvenge</hi> is a kind of wild Juſtice; which the more Man's Nature runs to, the more ought Law to weed it out. For as to the firſt wrong, it doth but offend the Law, but the <hi>Revenge</hi> of that wrong putteth the Law out of Office. Certainly in taking <hi>Revenge,</hi> a Man is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:94631:10"/>
but even with his Enemy; but in paſſing it over he is ſuperiour: for it is a Princes part to pardon. And <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon,</hi> I am ſure, ſaith, <hi>It is the Glory of a Man to paſs by an offence.</hi> That which is paſt, is gone, and irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and wiſe Men have enough to do with things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and to come: therefore they do but trifle with themſelves, that labour in paſt matters. There is no Man doth a wrong for the wrongs ſake, but thereby to purchaſe himſelf profit, or pleaſure, or honour, or the like. Therefore why ſhould I be angry with a Man for loving himſelf better than me? And if any Man ſhould do wrong meerly out of ill nature why? yet it is but like the Thorn or Bryar, which prick and ſcratch, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they can do no other. The moſt tolerable ſort of <hi>Revenge,</hi> is for thoſe wrongs which there is no Law to remedy: But then let a man take heed, that the <hi>Revenge</hi> be ſuch, as there is no Law to puniſh; elſe a Man's E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy is ſtill before-hand, and it is two for one.

                  <p>
                     <hi>DIſſimulation</hi> is but a faint kind of Policy or Wiſdom; for it asketh a ſtrong Wit and a ſtrong Heart, to know when to tell truth, and to do it. Therefore it is the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſort of Politicks, that are the great Diſſemblers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith, <hi>Livia ſorted well with the Arts of her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and Diſſimulation of her Son;</hi> attributing <hi>Arts</hi> or <hi>Policy</hi> to <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and <hi>Diſſimulation</hi> to <hi>Tiberius.</hi> And again, when <hi>Mucianus</hi> encourageth <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> to take Arms againſt <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellius,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>We riſe not againſt the piercing Judgment of</hi> Auguſtus, <hi>nor the extream Caution or Cloſeneſs of</hi> Tiberi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us. Theſe properties of <hi>Arts,</hi> or <hi>Policy</hi> and <hi>Diſſimulation,</hi> or <hi>Cloſeneſs,</hi> are indeed habits and faculties, ſeveral, and to be diſtinguiſhed. For if a man have that penetration of Judgment, as he can diſcern, what things are to be laid open, and what to be ſecreted, and what to be ſhewed at half lights, and to whom, and when (which indeed are Arts of State, and Arts of Life, as <hi>Tacitus</hi> well call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them) to him; a habit of <hi>Diſſimulation</hi> is a hindrance, and a poorneſs. But if a Man cannot attain to that Judgment, then it is left to him generally to be Cloſe, and a <hi>Diſſembler.</hi> For where a man cannot chuſe or va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in Particulars, there it is good to take the ſafeſt and wearieſt way in general; like the going ſoftly by one that cannot well ſee. Certainly the ableſt Men that ever
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:94631:11"/>
were, have had all an openneſs and frankneſs of dealing, and a Name of Certainty and Veracity: but then they were like Horſes, well managed; for they could tell paſſing well, when to ſtop or turn; And at ſuch times, when they thought the caſe indeed required <hi>Diſſimulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> if then they uſed it, it came to paſs, that the former Opinion ſpread abroad of their good faith, and clearneſs of dealing, made them almoſt inviſible.</p>
                  <p>There are three degrees of this hiding and veiling of Mans ſelf. The firſt <hi>Cloſeneſs, Reſervation,</hi> and <hi>Secrecy;</hi> when a Man leaveth himſelf without obſervation, or without hold to be taken what he is. The Second <hi>Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation</hi> in the <hi>Negative,</hi> when a Man lets fall Signs and Arguments, that he is not that he is. And the third <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation</hi> in the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> when a Man induſtriouſly and expreſly feigns and pretends to be that he is not.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt of theſe, <hi>Secrecy:</hi> It is indeed the vertue of a Confeſſor; and aſſuredly the <hi>Secret</hi> Man heareth many Confeſſions: For who will open himſelf to a Blab, or a Babler? But if a man be thought <hi>Secret,</hi> it inviteth diſcovery, as the more cloſe Air ſucketh in the more open: And as in confeſſion, the revealing is not for worldly uſe, but for the eaſe of a Mans heart; ſo <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,</hi> Men come to the knowledge of many things in that kind, while Men rather diſcharge their minds, than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part their minds. In few words, Myſteries are due to <hi>Secrecy.</hi> Beſides (to ſay truth) <hi>Nakedneſs</hi> is uncomely, as well in mind as in body; and it addeth no ſmall reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to Mens manners and actions, if they be not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether open. As for Talkers, and Futile perſons, they are commonly vain, and credulous withal. For he that talketh what he knoweth, will alſo talk what he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not. Therefore ſet it down, <hi>that an habit of Secrecy is both politick and moral.</hi> And in this part it is good, that a Mans face give his tongue leave to ſpeak. For the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Mans ſelf, by the tracts of his countenance, is a great weakneſs and betraying, by how much it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times more marked and believed, than a Mans words.</p>

And therefore a general cuſtom of <hi>Simulation</hi> (which is this laſt degree) is a Vice, riſing either of a natural falſeneſs or fearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or of a mind that hath ſome main faults; which becauſe a man muſt needs diſguiſe, it maketh him pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe <hi>Simulation</hi> in other things, leſt his hand ſhould be out of uſe.</p>
                  <p>The great <hi>advantages</hi> of <hi>Simulation</hi> and <hi>Diſſimulation</hi> are three. Firſt, To lay aſleep oppoſition, and to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe: For where a Mans intentions are publiſhed, it is an alarm to call up all that are againſt them. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is, to reſerve to a Mans ſelf a fair retreat: For if a man engage himſelf by a manifeſt Declaration, he muſt go through, or take a fall. The third is, the better to diſcover the mind of another: For to him that opens himſelf, Men will hardly ſhew themſelves averſe, but will (fair) let him go on, and turn their freedom of ſpeech to freedom of thought. And therefore it is a good ſhrewd Proverb of the <hi>Spaniard, Tell a Lye, and find a Truth;</hi> as if there were no way of diſcovery, but by <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.</hi>

There be alſo three <hi>diſadvantages</hi> to ſet it even. The firſt, That <hi>Simulation</hi> and <hi>Diſſimulation</hi> commonly carry with them a ſhew of fearfulneſs, which in any buſineſs doth ſpoil the feathers of round flying up to the mark.

The third and greateſt is, That it depriveth a man of one of the moſt principal inſtruments for action, which is <hi>Truſt</hi> and <hi>Belief.</hi> The compoſition and temperature is, to have <hi>Openneſs</hi> in fame and opinion, <hi>Secrecy</hi> in habit, <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation</hi> in ſeaſonable uſe, and a power to feign, if there be no remedy.</p>

For mens minds will either feed upon their own good, or upon others evil; and who want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the one, will pray upon the other; and who ſo is out of hope to attain to anothers vertue, will ſeek to come at even-hand by depreſſing anothers For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                  <p>A man that is buſie and inquiſitive, is commonly <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious:</hi> for to know much of other mens matters cannot be, becauſe all that ado may concern his eſtate; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt needs be, that he taketh a kind of play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure in looking upon the fortunes of others; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can he that mindeth but his own buſineſs, find much matter for <hi>Envy:</hi> For <hi>Envy</hi> is a gadding paſſion, and walketh the Streets, and doth not keep home, <hi>Non eſt curioſus, quin idem ſit malevolus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Men of noble Birth are noted to be <hi>envious</hi> towards new Men when they riſe: For the diſtance is altered;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:94631:15"/>
and it is like a deceit of the eye, that when others come on, they think themſelves go back.</p>
                  <p>Deformed perſons, and Eunuchs, and old Men, and Baſtards are <hi>envious:</hi> for he that cannot poſſibly mend his own caſe, will do what he can to impair anothers, except theſe defects light upon a very brave and heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal nature, which thinketh to make his natural wants part of his honour; in that it ſhould be ſaid, that an Eunuch, or lame man, did ſuch great matters, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the honour of a miracle, as it was in <hi>Narſes</hi> the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuch, and <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> and <hi>Tamberlanes,</hi> that were lame men.</p>
                  <p>The ſame is the caſe of men that riſe after calamities and misfortunes; for they are as men fallen out with the times, and think other mens harms a Redemption of their own ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>They that deſire to excel in too many matters, out of levity and vain glory, are ever <hi>Envious;</hi> For they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not want work, it being impoſſible but many in ſome one of thoſe things ſhould ſurpaſs them; which was the character of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Emperour, that mortally <hi>envied Poets</hi> and <hi>Painters,</hi> and <hi>Artificers</hi> in works wherein he had a vein to excel.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, near Kinsfolks and Fellows in Office, and thoſe that have been bred together, are more apt to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> their equals, when they are raiſed: For it doth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braid unto them their own fortunes, and pointeth at them, and cometh oftner into their remembrance, and incurreth likewiſe more into the note of others; and <hi>Envy</hi> ever redoubleth from Speech and Fame. <hi>Cain's Envy</hi> was the more vile and malignant towards his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Abel,</hi> becauſe when his Sacrifice was better accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there was no body to look on. Thus much for <hi>thoſe that are apt to Envy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Concerning <hi>thoſe that are more or leſs ſubject to Envy:</hi> Firſt, Perſons of eminent virtue, when they are advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced are leſs <hi>envied:</hi> For their fortune ſeemeth but due unto them; and no man <hi>envyeth</hi> the payment of a <hi>Debt,</hi>
                     <pb n="21" facs="tcp:94631:15"/>
but Rewards and Liberality rather. Again, <hi>Envy</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver joyned with the comparing of a man's ſelf; and where there is no compariſon, no <hi>Envy;</hi> and therefore Kings are not <hi>envied,</hi> but by Kings. Nevertheleſs it is to be noted, that unworthy perſons are moſt <hi>envied</hi> at their firſt coming in, and afterwards overcome it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; whereas contrariwiſe, Perſons of worth and merit are moſt envied, when their fortune continueth long. For by that time, though their virtue be the ſame, yet it hath not the ſame <hi>Luſtre;</hi> for freſh men grow up that darken it.</p>
                  <p>Perſons of noble blood are leſs <hi>envied</hi> in their riſing; for it ſeemeth but right done to their Birth. Beſides, there ſeemeth not much added to their fortune; and <hi>Envy</hi> is as the Sun-beams, that beat hotter upon a Bank or ſteep riſing Ground, than upon a Flat. And for the ſame reaſons, thoſe that are advanced by degrees are leſs <hi>envied,</hi> than thoſe that are advanced ſuddenly, and <hi>per ſaltum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe that have joyned with their Honour great Travels, Cares or Perils, are leſs ſubject to <hi>Envy:</hi> For men think that they earn their Honours hardly, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty them ſometimes; and Pity ever healeth <hi>Envy:</hi> Wherefore you ſhall obſerve, that the more deep and ſober ſort of politick Perſons in their greatneſs, are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bemoaning themſelves, what a life they lead, chant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Quanta patimur.</hi> Not that they feel it ſo, but only to abate the edge of <hi>Envy.</hi> But this is to be underſtood of buſineſs that is laid upon men, and not ſuch as they call unto themſelves. For nothing increaſeth <hi>Envy</hi> more than an unneceſſary and ambitious engroſſing of buſineſs; and nothing doth extinguiſh <hi>Envy</hi> more, than for a great Perſon to preſerve all other inferior Officers in their full rights and preheminencies of their places: for by that means there be ſo many Skreens between him and <hi>Envy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Above all, thoſe are moſt ſubject to <hi>Envy</hi> which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the greatneſs of their fortunes in an inſolent and

proud manner, being never well but while they ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſhewing how great they are, either by outward pomp, or by triumphing over all oppoſition or competition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereas wiſe men will rather do Sacrifice to <hi>Envy,</hi> in ſuffering themſelves ſometimes of purpoſe to be croſt and over-born of things that do not much concern them. Notwithſtanding ſo much is true, That the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of greatneſs in a plain and open manner (ſo it be without arrogancy and vain-glory) doth draw leſs <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy,</hi> than if it be in a more crafty and cunning faſhion. For in that courſe a man doth but diſavow fortune, and ſeemeth to be conſcious of his own want in worth, and doth but teach others to <hi>Envy</hi> him.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, To conclude this part; As we ſaid in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, that the Act of <hi>Envy</hi> had ſomewhat in it of <hi>witchcraft,</hi> ſo there is no other cure of <hi>Envy</hi> but the cure of <hi>witchcraft;</hi> and that is, to remove the <hi>Lot</hi> (as they call it) and to lay it upon another. For which purpoſe, the wiſer ſort of great Perſons, bring in ever upon the Stage ſome body upon whom to drive the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy</hi> that would come upon themſelves; ſometimes upon Miniſters and Servants, ſometimes upon Colleagues and Aſſociates, and the like; and for that turn there are never wanting ſome Perſons of violent and undertaking Natures, who, ſo they may have Power and Buſineſs, will take it at any coſt.</p>
                  <p>Now to ſpeak of <hi>publick Envy.</hi> There is yet ſome good in <hi>publick Envy;</hi> whereas in <hi>private</hi> there is none. For <hi>publick Envy</hi> is an <hi>Oſtraciſm,</hi> that eclipſeth men when they grow too great. And therefore it is a bridle alſo to great ones, to keep them within bounds.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Envy</hi> being in the Latine word <hi>Invidia,</hi> goeth in the modern Languages by the name of <hi>Diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> of which we ſhall ſpeak in handling <hi>Sedition.</hi> It is a diſeaſe in a State like to infection; for as infection ſpreadeth upon that which is ſound, and tainteth it; ſo when <hi>Envy</hi> is gotten once in a State, it traduceth even the beſt actions thereof, and turneth them into an ill
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:94631:16"/>
odour. And therefore there is little won by interming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of plauſible actions. For that doth argue but a weakneſs and fear of <hi>Envy,</hi> which hurteth ſo much the more, as it is likewiſe uſual in <hi>infections;</hi> which if you fear them, you call them upon you.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>publick Envy</hi> ſeemeth to bear chiefly upon prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Officers or Miniſters, rather than upon Kings and Eſtates themſelves. But this is a ſure rule, that if the <hi>Envy</hi> upon the Miniſters be great, when the cauſe of it in him is ſmall; or if the <hi>Envy</hi> be general, in a manner, upon all the Miniſters of an Eſtate, then the <hi>Envy</hi> (though hidden) is truly upon the State it ſelf. And ſo much of <hi>publick Envy</hi> or <hi>Diſcontentment,</hi> and the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference thereof from <hi>private Envy,</hi> which was handled in the firſt place.</p>
                  <p>We will add this in general, touching the Affection of <hi>Envy;</hi> that, of all other Affections, it is the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune and continual. For of other Affections there is occaſion given but now and then. And therefore it was well ſaid, <hi>Invidia feſtos dies non agit.</hi> For it is ever working upon ſome or other. And it is alſo noted, that <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> do make a man pine, which other Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections do not; becauſe they are not ſo continual. It is alſo the vileſt Affection, and the moſt depraved: for which cauſe it is the proper Attribute of the Devil, who is called <hi>the envious Man, that ſoweth Tares amongſt the Wheat by night:</hi> as it always cometh to paſs, that <hi>Envy</hi> worketh ſubtilly, and in the dark, and to the prejudice of good things, ſuch as is the <hi>Wheat.</hi>

                     </hi> ſometimes like a <hi>Fury.</hi> You may obſerve, that amongſt all the great and worthy perſons (whereof the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry remaineth, either Ancient or Recent) there is not one that hath been tranſported to the mad degree of <hi>Love:</hi> which ſhew, that great Spirits, and great Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, do keep out this weak Paſſion. You muſt except nevertheleſs, <hi>Marcus Antonius,</hi> the half Partner of the Empire of <hi>Rome;</hi> and <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> the <hi>Decemvir,</hi> the Law-giver: whereof the former was indeed a Volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Man, and Inordinate; but the Latter was an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere and Wiſe Man. And therefore it ſeems, (though rarely) that <hi>Love</hi> can <hi>find</hi> entrance, not only into an open Heart, but alſo into a Heart well fortified, if watch be not well kept. It is a poor ſaying of <hi>Epicurus, Satis magnum Alter Alteri Theatrum ſumus.</hi> As if Man, made for the contemplation of Heaven, and all noble Objects, ſhould do nothing but kneel before a little I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dol, and make himſelf a Subject, though not of the Mouth (as Beaſts are) yet of the Eye, which was given him for higher purpoſes. It is a ſtrange thing to note the Exceſs of this paſſion; and how it braves the Nature and value of things by this, that the ſpeaking in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>Hyperbole</hi> is comely in nothing but in <hi>Love.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it meerly in the Phraſe: for, whereas it hath been well ſaid, that the Arch-flatterer, with whom all the petty flatterers have intelligence, is a Man's ſelf; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the <hi>Love</hi> is more. For there was never a proud Man thought ſo abſurdly well of himſelf, as the <hi>Lover</hi> doth of the Perſon <hi>Loved:</hi> and therefore it was well ſaid, that <hi>it is impoſſible to Love, and to be wiſe.</hi> Neither doth this weakneſs appear to others only, and not to the Party <hi>Loved:</hi> but to the <hi>Loved</hi> moſt of all; except the <hi>Love</hi> be reciproque: for it is a true rule, that <hi>Love</hi> is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver rewarded, either with the reciproque, or with an inward and ſecret Contempt. By how much the more men ought to beware of this Paſſion, which loſeth not only other things, but it ſelf. As for the other loſſes,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:94631:17"/>
the <hi>Poets</hi> Relation doth well figure them; that he that preferreth <hi>Helena,</hi> quitteth the gifts of <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Pallas.</hi> For whoſoever eſteemeth too much of amorous affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, quitteth both <hi>Riches</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> This Paſſion hath his Floods in the very times of weakneſs: which are great <hi>Proſperity,</hi> and great <hi>Adverſity;</hi> though this latter hath been leſs obſerved. Both which times kindle <hi>Love,</hi> and make it more frequent, and therefore ſhew it to be the Child of Folly. They do beſt, who, if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but admit <hi>Love;</hi> yet make it keep Quarter, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it wholly from their ſerious Affairs and Actions of Life: for if it check once with Buſineſs, it troubleth mens Fortunes, and maketh men that they can no ways be true to their own Ends.

All riſing to <hi>Great Place,</hi> is by a winding Stair; and if there be Factions, it is good to ſide a Mans ſelf, whilſt he is in the Riſing; and to balance himſelf when he is placed. Uſe the memory of thy Predeceſſor fairly and tenderly; for if thou doſt not, it is a debt will ſure be paid when thou art gone. If thou have Colleagues, reſpect them, and rather call them when they look not for it, than exclude them when they have reaſon to look to be called. Be not too ſenſible, or too remembring of thy Place in Converſation, and private Anſwers to Suitors; But let it rather be ſaid, <hi>When he ſits in Place he is another Man.</hi>

to expreſs it. <hi>Goodneſs</hi> I call the Habit, and <hi>Goodneſs of Nature</hi> the Inclination. This of all Vertues and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the mind is the greateſt, being the Character of the Deity; and without it man is a buſie, miſchievous wretched thing, no better than a kind of Vermine. <hi>Goodneſs</hi> anſwers to the <hi>Theological Vertue, Charity,</hi> and admits no exceſs, but error. The deſire of power in exceſs cauſed the Angels to fall; the deſire of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in exceſs cauſed Man to fall; but in <hi>Charity</hi> there is no exceſs, neither can Angel or Man come in danger by it. The inclination of <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is imprinted deeply in the nature of man; inſomuch, that if it iſſue not to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards men, it will take unto other living Creatures; as it is ſeen in the <hi>Turks,</hi> a cruel people, who nevertheleſs are kind to Beaſts, and give Alms to Dogs and Birds: Inſomuch as <hi>Busbechius</hi> reporteth, a Chriſtian Boy in <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had like to have been ſtoned for gagging, in a waggiſhneſs, a long-billed Fowl. Errors indeed, in this Vertue, in <hi>Goodneſs</hi> or <hi>Charity</hi> may be committed. The <hi>Italians</hi> have an ungracious Proverb, <hi>Tanto buon che val niente; So good that he is good for nothing.</hi> And one of the Doctors of <hi>Italy, Nicholas Macchiavel,</hi> had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence to put in writing, almoſt in plain terms, <hi>That the Chriſtian Faith had given up good men in prey to thoſe that are tyrannical and unjuſt:</hi> which he ſpake, becauſe indeed there was never Law, or Sect, or Opinion, did ſo much magnifie <hi>Goodneſs</hi> as the Chriſtian Religion doth: therefore, to avoid the ſcandal, and danger both, it is good to take knowledge of the errors of an Habit ſo excellent. Seek the good of other men, but be not in bondage to their faces or fancies; for that is but fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility or ſoftneſs, which taketh an honeſt mind priſoner. Neither give the <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Cock a Gem, who would be better pleaſed and happier if he had had a Barly Corn. The Example of God teacheth the Leſſon truly: <hi>He ſendeth his Rain, and maketh his Sun to ſhine upon the Juſt and Unjuſt;</hi> but he doth not rain Wealth, nor ſhine Honour and Virtues upon Men equally. Common Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:94631:21"/>
are to be communicated with all; but peculiar be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nefits with choice. And beware, how in making the <hi>Portraiture,</hi> thou breakeſt the Pattern; for Divinity maketh the love of our ſelves the Pattern; the love of our Neighbours but the Portraiture. <hi>Sell all thou haſt and give it to the poor, and follow me:</hi> but ſell not all thou haſt, except thou come and follow me; that is, except thou have a Vocation, wherein thou mayſt do as much good with little means as with great: for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in feeding the Streams thou drieſt the Fountain. Neither is there only a <hi>Habit</hi> of <hi>Goodneſs</hi> directed by right Reaſon: but there is in ſome Men, even in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a diſpoſition towards it; as on the other ſide, there is a natural malignity. For there be that in their Nature do not affect the good of others. The lighter ſort of malignity turneth but to croſsneſs, or froward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or aptneſs to oppoſe, or difficileneſs, or the like; but the deeper ſort to envy and meer miſchief. Such men in other mens calamities, are as it were in ſeaſon, and are ever on the loading part; not ſo good as the Dogs that licked <hi>Lazarus</hi>'s ſores, but like Flies, that are ſtill buzzing upon any thing that is raw; <hi>Miſanthrop,</hi> that make it their practice to bring men to the Bough, and yet have never a Tree for the purpoſe in their Gardens, as <hi>Timon</hi> had. Such diſpoſitions are the very errors of Humane Nature; and yet they are the fitteſt Timber to make great Politicks of: like to knee-Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that is good for Ships that are ordained to be toſſed, but not for building Houſes, that ſhall ſtand firm. The parts and ſigns of <hi>Goodneſs</hi> are many. If a Man be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and courteous to Strangers, it ſhews he is a Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of the world; and that his heart is no Iſland cut off from other Lands, but a Continent that joyns to them. If he be compaſſionate towards the afflictions of others, it ſhews that his heart is like the noble Tree, that is wounded it ſelf, when it gives the Balm. If he eaſily pardons and remits offences, it ſhews that his mind is planted above Injuries, ſo that he cannot be ſhot. If he
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:94631:21"/>
be thankful for ſmall benefits, it ſhews that he weighs mens minds, and not their traſh. But above all, if he have Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s perfection, that he would wiſh to be an <hi>Anathema</hi> from Chriſt, for the Salvation of his Brethren, it ſhews much of a Divine Nature, and a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity with <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf.</p>

We ſee the <hi>Switzers</hi> laſt well, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their diverſity of Religion, and of Cantons: for Utility is their Bond, and not Reſpects. The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces of the <hi>Low-Countries</hi> in their Government excel: for where there is an equality, the Conſultations are more indifferent, and the payments and tributes more chearful. A great and potent <hi>Nobility</hi> addeth Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty to a Monarch, but diminiſheth Power; and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth Life and Spirit into the People, but preſſeth their Fortune. It is well when <hi>Nobles</hi> are not too great for Soveraignty, nor for juſtice; and yet maintained in that height, as the Inſolency of Inferiours may be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken upon them, before it come on too faſt upon the Majeſty of Kings. A numerous <hi>Nobility</hi> cauſeth Pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

and inconvenience in a State: for it is a furcharge of expence; and beſides, it being of neceſſity that many of the <hi>Nobility</hi> fall in time to be weak in Fortune, it maketh a kind of Diſproportion between Honour and Means.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Nobility</hi> in <hi>particular Perſons,</hi> It is a reverend thing to ſee an ancient Caſtle or Building not in decay; or to ſee a fair Timber Tree ſound and perfect: how much more to behold an Ancient <hi>Noble Family,</hi> which hath ſtood againſt the Waves and Weathers of Time. For New <hi>Nobility</hi> is but the Act of Power; but Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Nobility</hi> is the Act of Time. Thoſe that are firſt raiſed to <hi>Nobility</hi> are commonly more virtuous, but leſs innocent than their Deſcendents; for there is rarely any Riſing, but by a commixture of good and evil Arts. But it is reaſon the memory of their Vertues remain to their Poſterity; and their faults die with themſelves. <hi>Nobility</hi> of <hi>Birth</hi> commonly abateth induſtry; and he that is not induſtrious, envieth him that is. Beſides, <hi>Noble Perſons</hi> cannot go much higher; and he that ſtandeth at a ſtay when others riſe, can hardly avoid motions of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy. On the other ſide, <hi>Nobility</hi> extinguiſheth the Paſſive Envy from others towards them; becauſe they are in poſſeſſion of Honour. Certainly Kings that have able Men of their <hi>Nobility,</hi> ſhall find eaſe in employing them, and a better ſlide into their buſineſs: for people naturally bend to them, as born in ſome ſort to command.</p>

                  <p>Alſo that kind of obedience which <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſpeaketh of is to be held ſuſpected; <hi>Erant in officio, ſed tamen qui mallent mandata Imperantium interpretari, quam exequi;</hi> Diſputing, Excuſing, Cavilling upon Mandates and Directions, is a kind of ſhaking off the yoak, and eſſay

of diſobedience; eſpecially, if in thoſe Diſputings, they which are for the direction, ſpeak fearfully and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and thoſe that are againſt it audaciouſly.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, as <hi>Machiavel</hi> noteth well; when Princes, that ought to be common Parents, make themſelves as a Party, and lean to a ſide, it is a Boat that is overthrown by uneaven weight on the one ſide; as was well ſeen in the time of <hi>Henry</hi> the third of <hi>France:</hi> for firſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf entred League for the extirpation of the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and preſently after the fame League was turned upon himſelf: for when the Authority of Princes is made but an Acceſſary to a Cauſe, and that there are other Bands that tie faſter than the Band of Soveraignty, Kings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be almoſt put out of poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Alſo, when Diſcords, and Quarrels, and Factions are carried openly and audaciouſly, it is a ſign the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence of Government is loſt. For the Motions of the greateſt Perſons in a Government, ought to be as the motions of the Planets under <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the old Opinion:) which is, that every of them is carried ſwiftly by the higheſt Motion, and ſoftly in their own Motion. And therefore when great Ones in their own particular Motion move violently; and as <hi>Tacitus</hi> expreſſeth it well, <hi>Liberius quam ut Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perantium meminiſſent,</hi> it is a ſign the Orbs are out of Frame: for Reverence is that wherewith Princes are girt from God, who threatneth the diſſolving thereof; <hi>Solvam cingula Regum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So when any of the four Pillars of Government are mainly ſhaken or weakned, (which are <hi>Religion, Juſtice, Counſel,</hi> and <hi>Treaſure)</hi> Men had need to pray for fair weather.</p>
                  <p>But let us paſs from this part of Predictions (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning which, nevertheleſs, more light may be taken from that which followeth) and let us ſpeak firſt of the <hi>Materials</hi> of <hi>Seditions;</hi> then of the <hi>Motives</hi> of them; and thirdly, of the <hi>Remedies.</hi>

Concerning the <hi>Materials</hi> of <hi>Seditions;</hi> It is a thing well to be conſidered: For the ſureſt way to prevent <hi>Seditions</hi> (if the times do bear it) is to take away the matter of them. For if there be fuel prepared, it is hard to tell whence the ſpark ſhall come that ſhall ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Seditions</hi> is of two kinds; <hi>much Poverty</hi> and <hi>much Diſcontentment.</hi> It is certain, ſo many <hi>Overthrown Eſtates,</hi> ſo many votes for <hi>Troubles.

                  </q>
                  <p>This ſame <hi>multis utile Bellum</hi> is an aſſured and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſign of a State diſpoſed to <hi>Seditions</hi> and <hi>Troubles.</hi> And if this <hi>Poverty</hi> and broken Eſtate in the better ſort, be joyned with a want and neceſſity in the mean Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the danger is eminent and great; ſor the Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of the Belly are the worſt. As for <hi>Diſcontentments,</hi> they are in the Politick Body like to Humours in the Natural, which are apt to gather pre-natural Heat, and to enflame. And let no Prince meaſure the danger of them by this, whether they be juſt or unjuſt: for that were to imagine People to be too reaſonable, who do often ſpurn at their own good: nor yet by this, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the griefs whereupon they riſe, be in fact great or ſmall: for they are the moſt dangerous <hi>Diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> where the fear is greater than the feeling. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lendi modus, Timendi non item.</hi> Beſides, in great Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, the ſame things that provoke the Patience, do withal make the courage; but in fears it is not ſo. Neither let any Prince or State be ſecure concerning <hi>Diſcontentments</hi> becauſe they have been often, or have been long, and yet no Peril hath enſued; for as it is true, that every Vapour or Fume doth not turn into a Storm: So it is nevertheleſs true, that Storms though they blow over divers times, yet may fall at laſt: and as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Proverb noteth well; <hi>The Cord breaketh at the laſt by the weakeſt pull.</hi>

The <hi>Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Motions</hi> of <hi>Seditions</hi> are, <hi>Innovation in Religion, Taxes, Alteration of Laws and Cuſtoms, breaking of Privileges, General Oppreſſion, Advancement of unworthy Perſons, Strangers, Dearths, Disbanded Souldiers, Factions grown deſperate.</hi> And whatſoever in offending People, joyneth and knitteth them in a Common Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>For the <hi>Remedies;</hi> there may be ſome general Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatives whereof we will ſpeak; as for the juſt Cure, it muſt anſwer to the particular Diſeaſe, and ſo be left to Counſel rather than Rule.</p>
                  <p>The firſt <hi>Remedy</hi> or Prevention is, to remove by all means poſſible that <hi>Material Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Sedition,</hi> whereof we ſpeak; which is <hi>Want</hi> and <hi>Poverty</hi> in the <hi>Eſtate.</hi> To which purpoſe ſerveth the Opening and well Ballancing of Trade, the Cheriſhing of Manufactures, the Baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Idleneſs, the Repreſſing of Waſte and Exceſs by Sumptuary Laws, the Improvement and Husbanding of the Soyl, the Regulating of Prices of Things vendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the Moderating of Taxes and Tributes, and the like. Generally it is to be foreſeen, that the Populati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Kingdom (eſpecially if it be not mowen down by Wars) do not exceed the Stock of the Kingdom, which ſhould maintain them. Neither is the Populati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be reckoned only by number; for a ſmaller num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that ſpend more, and earn leſs, do wear out an Eſtate ſooner than a greater number that live lower, and gather more. Therefore the multiplying of Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and other Degrees of Quality, in an over Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Common People, doth ſpeedily bring a State to Neceſſity: and ſo doth likewiſe an overgrown Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, for they bring nothing to the Stock. And in like manner, when more are bred Scholars than Preferments can take off.</p>
                  <p>It is likewiſe to be remembred, that foraſmuch as the increaſe of any Eſtate muſt be upon the Foreigners; (for whatſoever is ſomewhere gotten, is ſomewhere loſt.) There be but three things which one Nation ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth unto another; the <hi>Commodity</hi> as Nature yieldeth it;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:94631:24"/>
the <hi>Manufacture</hi> and the <hi>Vecture</hi> or <hi>Carriage:</hi> So that if theſe three Wheels go, Wealth will flow as in a Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tide. And it cometh many times to paſs, that <hi>Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am ſuperabit Opus;</hi> that the Work and Carriage is more worth than the Materials, and inricheth a State more: as is notably ſeen in the <hi>Low Country-men,</hi> who have the beſt Mines above Ground in the World.</p>
                  <p>Above all things good Policy is to be uſed, that the Treaſure and Moneys in a State be not gathered into few Hands. For otherwiſe a State may have a great Stock, and yet ſtarve. And Money is like Muck, not good except it be ſpread. This is done chiefly by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing, or at the leaſt keeping a ſtraight hand upon the Devouring Trades of <hi>Uſury, Ingroſing,</hi> great <hi>Paſtura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,</hi> and the like.</p>
                  <p>For removing <hi>Diſcontentments,</hi> or at leaſt the danger of them, there is in every State (as we know) two por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Subjects,</hi> the <hi>Nobleſs</hi> and the <hi>Commonalty.</hi> When one of theſe is <hi>Diſcontent,</hi> the danger is not great: for common people are of ſlow motion, if they be not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the greater ſort; and the greater ſort are of ſmall ſtrength, except the multitude be apt and ready to move of themſelves. Then this is the danger, when the greater ſort do but wait for the troubling of the Waters amongſt the meaner, that then they may declare themſelves. The Poets feign, that the reſt of the Gods would have bound <hi>Jupiter;</hi> which he hearing of, by the Counſel of <hi>Pallas,</hi> ſent for <hi>Briareus</hi> with his hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred hands, to come in to his aid. An Emblem no doubt, to ſhew how ſafe it is for Monarchs to make ſure of the good will of common people.</p>
                  <p>To give moderate liberty for <hi>Griefs</hi> and <hi>Diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> to evaporate (ſo it be without too great Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency or bravery) is a ſafe way. For he that turneth the Humours back, and maketh the Wound bleed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, endangereth malign Ulcers, and pernicious Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſthumations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="40" facs="tcp:94631:25"/>
The part of <hi>Epimetheus</hi> might well become <hi>Prometheus</hi> in the caſe of <hi>Diſcontentments;</hi> for there is not a better proviſion againſt them. <hi>Epimetheus,</hi> when griefs and evils flew abroad, at laſt ſhut the Lid, and kept Hope in the bottom of the Veſſel. Certainly the politick and artificial nouriſhing and entertaining of <hi>Hopes,</hi> and carrying men from <hi>Hopes</hi> to <hi>Hopes,</hi> is one of the beſt Antidotes againſt the Poyſon of <hi>Diſcontentments.</hi> And it is a certain ſign of a wiſe Government and Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when it can hold mens hearts by <hi>Hopes</hi> when it cannot by ſatisfaction; and when it can handle things in ſuch manner, as no evil ſhall appear ſo peremptory but that it hath ſome out-let of <hi>Hope:</hi> which is the leſs hard to do, becauſe both particular Perſons and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons art apt enough to flatter themſelves, or at leaſt to brave that which they believe not.</p>
                  <p>Alſo the fore-ſight and prevention, that there be no likely or fit Head, whereunto <hi>Diſcontented Perſons</hi> may reſort, and under whom they may joyn, is a known, but an excellent point of caution. I underſtand a fit Head to be one that hath Greatneſs and Reputation, that hath Confidence with the <hi>Diſcontented</hi> Party, and upon whom they turn their eyes; and that is thought <hi>Diſcontented</hi> in his own particular; which kind of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are either to be won, and reconciled to the State, and that in a faſt and true manner; or to be fronted with ſome other of the ſame Party that may oppoſe them, and ſo divide the Reputation. Generally the dividing and breaking of all Factions and Combinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are adverſe to the State, and ſetting them at diſtance, or at leaſt diſtruſt among themſelves, is not one of the worſt <hi>Remedies.</hi> For it is a deſperate caſe, if thoſe that hold with the proceeding of the State, be full of Diſcord and Faction; and thoſe that are againſt it, be entire and United.</p>
                  <p>I have noted, that ſome witty and ſharp Speeches, which have fallen from <hi>Princes,</hi> have given fire to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. Caeſar</hi> did himſelf infinite hurt in that Speech,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:94631:25"/>
                     <hi>Sylla neſcivit literas, non potuit dictare:</hi> for it did utterly cut off that <hi>Hope</hi> which men had entertained, that he would at one time or other give over his Dictatorſhip. <hi>Galba</hi> undid himſelf by that Speech, <hi>Legi à ſe militem non emi,</hi> for it put the Soldiers out of Hope of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>native. <hi>Probus</hi> likewiſe by that ſpeech, <hi>Si vixero, non opus erit amplius Romano Imperio militibus:</hi> A Speech of great deſpair for the Soldiers: And many the like. Surely <hi>Princes</hi> had need, in tender matters, and tickliſh times, to beware what they ſay; eſpecially in theſe ſhort Speeches, which fly abroad like Darts, and are thought to be ſhot out of their ſecret Intentions. For as for large Diſcourſes, they are flat things, and not ſo much noted.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, Let Princes againſt all Events not be without ſome great Perſon, one, or rather more, of Military Valour near unto them, for the repreſſing of <hi>Seditions</hi> in their beginnings. For without that, there uſeth to be more trepidation in Court, upon the firſt breaking out of <hi>Troubles,</hi> than were fit.

wrought a Miracle to convince <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> becauſe his ordinary Works convince it. It is true, that a little Philoſophy inclineth Mans mind to <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> but depth in Philoſophy bringeth Mens minds about to <hi>Religion,</hi> for while the mind of man looketh upon ſecond Cauſes ſcattered, it may ſometimes reſt in them, and go no further: but when it beholdeth the Chain of them Confederate and Linked together, it muſt needs fly to <hi>Providence</hi> and <hi>Deity.</hi> Nay, even that <hi>School</hi> which is moſt accuſed of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> doth moſt demonſtrate <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:</hi> That is, the <hi>School</hi> of <hi>Leucippus</hi> and <hi>Democritus,</hi> and <hi>Epicurus.</hi> For it is a thouſand times more credible, that four mutable Elements, and one immutable fifth Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, duly and eternally placed, need no God, than that an Army of infinite ſmall Portions, or Seeds un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, ſhould have produced this order and beauty without a Divine Marſhal. The Scripture ſaith, <hi>The Fool hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God:</hi> it is not ſaid, <hi>The fool hath thought in his heart:</hi> So as he rather ſaith it by rote to himſelf, as that he would have, than that he can throughly believe it, or be perſwaded of it. For none deny there is a God, but thoſe for whom it maketh that there were no God. It appeareth in nothing more, that <hi>Atheiſm</hi> is rather in the <hi>Lip,</hi> than in the <hi>Heart</hi> of Man, than by this; That <hi>Atheiſts</hi> will ever be talking of that their Opinion, as if they fainted in it within themſelves, and would be glad to be ſtrengthned by the conſent of others. Nay more, you ſhall have <hi>Atheiſts</hi> ſtrive to get <hi>Diſciples,</hi> as it fareth with other Sects. And, which is moſt of all, you ſhall have of them that will ſuffer for <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and not recant; whereas if they did truly think, that there were no ſuch thing as <hi>God,</hi> why ſhould they trouble themſelves? <hi>Epicurus</hi> is charged, that he did but diſſemble for his credits ſake, when he affirmed, there were <hi>Bleſſed Natures,</hi> but ſuch as enjoyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, without having reſpect to the Government of the World: wherein, they ſay, he did temporize; though in ſecret he thought there was no God. But certainly
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:94631:26"/>
he is traduced; for his Words are Noble and Divine; <hi>Non Deos vulgi negare profanum, ſed vulgi Opiniones Diis applicare profanum. Plato</hi> could have ſaid no more. And although he had the confidence to deny the <hi>Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> he had not the power to deny the <hi>Nature.</hi> The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> of the <hi>Weſt</hi> have names for their particular <hi>gods,</hi> though they have no name for <hi>God;</hi> as if the <hi>Heathens</hi> ſhould have had the names of <hi>Jupiter, Apollo, Mars,</hi> &amp;c. but not the word <hi>Deus:</hi> ſhews, that even thoſe barbarous People have the notion, hough they have not the latitude and extent of it. So that againſt the <hi>Atheiſt</hi> the very Savages take part with the very ſubtileſt Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers: The Contemplative <hi>Atheiſt</hi> is rare: A <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras,</hi> a <hi>Bion,</hi> a <hi>Lucian</hi> perhaps, and ſome others; and yet they ſeem to be more than they are: For that all that impugn a received <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Superſtition,</hi> are by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe part branded with the name of <hi>Atheiſts.</hi> But the great <hi>Atheiſts</hi> indeed are <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> which are ever hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Holy things, but without feeling; ſo as they muſt needs be cauterized in the end. The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> are <hi>Diviſions</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> if they be many: for any one main <hi>Diviſion</hi> addeth Zeal to both ſides, but many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions introduce <hi>Atheiſm.</hi> Another is, <hi>Scandal</hi> of <hi>Prieſts,</hi> when it is come to that which Saint <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith, <hi>Non eſt jam dicere, ut populus, ſacerdos: quia nec ſic populus, ut ſacerdos.</hi> A third is, Cuſtom of <hi>Prophane Scoffing</hi> in <hi>Holy Matters,</hi> which doth by little and little deface the Reverence of Religion. And laſtly, <hi>Learned Times,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially with peace and proſperity: for troubles and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities do more bow Mens minds to <hi>Religion.</hi> They that deny a <hi>God,</hi> deſtroy Mans Nobility: for certainly Man is of kin to the Beaſts by his Body; and if he be not of kin to <hi>God</hi> by his Spirit; he is a baſe and ignoble Creature. It deſtroys likewiſe Magnanimity, and the raiſing Humane Nature: for take an example of a Dog, and mark what a generoſity and courage he will put on, when he finds himſelf maintained by a Man, who to him is inſtead of a <hi>God.</hi> or <hi>Melior natura:</hi> Which cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:94631:27"/>
is manifeſtly ſuch, as that Creature without the confidence of a better Nature than his own, could never attain. So Man, when he reſteth and aſſureth himſelf upon Divine protection and favour, gathereth a force and faith, which Humane Nature in it ſelf could not obtain. Therefore as <hi>Atheiſm</hi> is in all reſpects hateful, ſo in this, that it depriveth Humane Nature of the means to exalt it ſelf above Humane Frailty. As it is in particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, ſo it is in Nations.

                  <p>IT were better to have no opinion of <hi>God</hi> at all, than ſuch an opinion as is unworthy of him: For the one is Unbelief, the other is Contumely; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Superſtition</hi> is the reproach of the <hi>Deity.

It was gravely ſaid by ſome of the Prelates in the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent,</hi> where the Doctrine of the School-men bare great ſway, <hi>That the School-men were like Aſtronomers, which did feign Eccentricks, and Epicycles, and ſuch engines of Orbs, to ſave the Phoenomena; though they knew there were no ſuch things.</hi> And in like manner, that the School-men had framed a number of ſubtile and intricate <hi>Axi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oms</hi> and <hi>Theorems,</hi> to ſave the practice of the Church. The <hi>Cauſes</hi> of <hi>Superſtitions</hi> are, pleaſing and ſenſual Rites and Ceremonies: Exceſs of Outward and Phariſaical Holineſs: Over-great Reverence of Traditions, which cannot but load the Church: the Stratagems of Prelates for their own Ambition and Lucre: the favouring too much of good Intentions, which openeth the Gate to Conceits and Novelties: the taking an Aim at Divine Matters by Humane, which cannot but breed mixture of Imaginations: And laſtly, Barbarous Times, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally joyned with Calamities and Diſaſters. <hi>Superſtition</hi> without a veil is a deformed thing; for, as it addeth deformity to an Ape to be ſo like a Man: ſo the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of <hi>Superſtition</hi> to <hi>Religion</hi> makes it the more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. And as wholſome Meat corrupteth to little Worms: ſo good Forms and Orders corrupt into a Number of petty Obſervances. There is a <hi>Superſtition</hi> in avoiding <hi>Superſtition,</hi> when men think to do beſt, if they go furtheſt from the <hi>Superſtition</hi> formerly received. Therefore Care would be had, that (as it fareth in ill Purgings) the good be not taken away with the bad,

                     <hi>TRAVEL,</hi> in the younger Sort, is a part of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; in the elder, a part of Experience. He that <hi>Travelleth</hi> into a Countrey before he hath ſome En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Language, goeth to <hi>School</hi> and not to <hi>Travel.</hi> That young men <hi>Travel</hi> under ſome Tutor, or grave Servant, I allow well, ſo that he be ſuch a one that hath the Language, and hath been in the Country before, whereby he may be able to tell them, what things are worthy to be ſeen in the Countrey where they go, what Acquaintances they are to ſeek, what Exerciſes or Diſcipline the Place yieldeth. For elſe young men ſhall go hooded, and look abroad little. It is a ſtrange thing, that in Sea-voyages, where there is nothing to be ſeen but Sky and Sea, men ſhould make Diaries; but in <hi>Land-Travel,</hi> wherein ſo much is to be obſerved, for the moſt part they omit it; as if Chance were fitter to be regiſtred than Obſervation. Let Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries therefore be brought in uſe. The things to be ſeen and obſerved are the Courts of Princes, eſpecially when they give Audience to Embaſſadors: The Courts of Juſtice, while they ſit and hear Cauſes, and ſo of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtories Eccleſiaſtick: the Churches and Monaſteries, with the Monuments which are therein extant: the Walls and Fortifications of Cities and Towns; and ſo the Havens and Harbors: Antiquities and Ruins: Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braries, Colleges, Diſputations and Lectures, where any are: Shipping and Natives: Houſes and Gardens of State and Pleaſure near great Cities: Armories, Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals, Magazines, Exchanges, Burſes, Ware-houſes: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:94631:28"/>
of Horſmanſhip, Fencing, Training of Souldiers, and the like: Comedies, ſuch whereunto the better ſort of Perſons do reſort. Treaſures of Jewels and Robes: Cabinets and Rarities. And to conclude, whatſoever is memorable in the Places where they go. After all which the Tutors or Servants ought to make diligent enquiry. As for Triumphs, Maſques, Feaſts, Weddings, Funerals, Capital Executions, and ſuch Shews; Men need not to be put in mind of them; yet are they not to be neglected. If you will have a young man to put his <hi>Travel</hi> into a little room, and in ſhort time to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther much, this you muſt do. Firſt, as we ſaid, he muſt have ſome entrance into the Language before he goeth. Then he muſt have ſuch a Servant or Tutor as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Countrey, as was likewiſe ſaid. Let him carry with him alſo ſome Chard or Book, deſcribing the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey where he <hi>Travelleth,</hi> which will be a good key to his Enquiry. Let him keep alſo a Diary. Let him not ſtay long in one City or Town, more or leſs, as the Place deſerveth, but not long: Nay, when he ſtayeth in one City or Town, let him change his Lodging from one end and part of the Town to another, which is a great Adamant of Acquaintance. Let him ſequeſter himſelf from the Company of his Countrey-men, and diet in ſuch Places where there is good Company of the Nation where he <hi>Travelleth.</hi> Let him upon his Removes from one Place to another, procure recommendation to ſome Perſon of Quality, reſiding in the Place whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he removeth, that he may uſe his Favour in thoſe things he deſireth to ſee or know. Thus he may a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge his <hi>Travels</hi> with much profit. As for the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance which is to be ſought in <hi>Travel,</hi> that which is moſt of all profitable, is Acquaintance with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries and employed Men of Embaſſadors; for ſo in <hi>Travelling</hi> in one Country, he ſhall ſuck the experience of many. Let him alſo ſee and viſit eminent Perſons, in all kinds, which are of great Name abroad; that he may be able to tell how the Life agreeth with the Fame.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:94631:29"/>
For Quarrels, they are with Care and Diſcretion to be avoided: They are commonly for Miſtreſſes, Healths, Place, and Words. And let a Man beware how he keepeth Company with Cholerick and Quarrelſome Perſons, for they will engage him into their own Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels. When a <hi>Traveller</hi> returneth home, let him not leave the Countries where he hath <hi>Travelled,</hi> altogether behind him, but maintain a Correſpondency by Letters with thoſe of his Acquaintance which are of moſt worth. And let his <hi>Travel</hi> appear rather in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, than in his Apparel or Geſture; and in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe let him be rather adviſed in his Anſwers, than forward to tell Stories: And let it appear, that he doth not change his Countrey Manners for thoſe of Foreign Parts; but only prick in ſome Flowers of that he hath learned abroad, into the Cuſtoms of his own Countrey.</p>

                  <head>XIX. Of Empire.</head>
                  <p>IT is a miſerable State of Mind, to have few things to deſire, and many things to fear, and yet that commonly is the Caſe of <hi>Kings,</hi> who being at the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, want matter of deſire, which makes their minds more languiſhing, and have many Repreſentations of Perils and Shadows, which makes their minds the leſs clear. And this is one reaſon alſo of that effect which the Scripture ſpeaketh of; <hi>That the King's heart is inſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</hi> For, multitude of Jealouſies, and lack of ſome predominant deſire that ſhould marſhal and put in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the reſt, maketh any Mans heart hard to find or ſound. Hence it comes likewiſe, that <hi>Princes</hi> many times make themſelves Deſire, and ſet their Hearts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Toys: ſometimes upon a Building, ſometimes upon erecting of an Order, ſometimes upon the advancing
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:94631:29"/>
of a Perſon, ſometimes upon obtaining excellency in ſome Art or Feat of the Hand; as <hi>Nero</hi> for playing on the Harp, <hi>Domitian</hi> for Certainty of the Hand with the Arrow, <hi>Commodus</hi> for playing at Fence, <hi>Caracalla</hi> for dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chariots, and the like. This ſeemeth incredible unto thoſe that know not the principal; <hi>That the mind of Man is more cheared and refreſhed by profiting in ſmall things, than by ſtanding at a ſtay in great.</hi> We ſee alſo that the <hi>Kings</hi> that have been fortunate Conquerours in their firſt years, it being not poſſible for them to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward infinitely, but that they muſt have ſome check or arreſt in their Fortunes, turn in their latter years to be Superſtitious and Melancholy: as did <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, <hi>Diocleſian;</hi> and in our memory, <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth, and others: For he that is uſed to go forward, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a ſtop, falleth out of his own favour, and is not the thing he was.</p>
                  <p>To ſpeak now of the true Temper of <hi>Empire;</hi> It is a thing rare, and hard to keep; for both Temper and Diſtemper conſiſt of Contraries. But it is one thing to mingle Contraries, another to interchange them. The Anſwer of <hi>Apollonius</hi> to <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> is full of excellent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction; <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> asked him, <hi>What was</hi> Nero<hi>'s over-throw?</hi> He anſwered, Nero <hi>could touch and tune the Harp well, but in Government ſometimes he uſed to wind the pins too high, ſometimes to let them down too low.</hi> And certain it is, that nothing deſtroyeth Authority ſo much, as the unequal and untimely interchange of Power <hi>Preſſed</hi> too far, and <hi>Relaxed</hi> too much.</p>
                  <p>This is true, that the Wiſdom of all theſe latter Times in <hi>Princes</hi> Affairs, is rather fine Deliveries, and Shift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Dangers and Miſchiefs, when they are near, than ſolid and grounded Courſes to keep them aloof. But this is but to try Maſteries with Fortune: and let men beware how they neglect and ſuffer matter of Trouble to be prepared: for no man can forbid the ſpark, nor tell whence it may come. The difficulties in <hi>Princes</hi> Buſineſs are many and great; but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:94631:30"/>
difficulty is often in their own mind. For it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with <hi>Princes</hi> (ſaith <hi>Tacitus)</hi> to will Contradictories. <hi>Sunt plerumque Regum voluntates vehementes, &amp; inter ſe contrariae.</hi> For it is the Soleciſm of Power, to think to Command the end, and yet not endure the means.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Kings</hi> have to deal with their <hi>Neighbours,</hi> their <hi>Wives,</hi> their <hi>Children,</hi> their <hi>Prelates</hi> or <hi>Clergie,</hi> their <hi>Nobles,</hi> their <hi>Second Nobles</hi> or <hi>Gentlemen,</hi> their <hi>Merchants,</hi> their <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> and their <hi>Men of War.</hi> And from all theſe ariſe Dangers, if Care and Circumſpection be not uſed.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, For their <hi>Neighbours:</hi> There can no general Rule be given (the occaſions are ſo variable) ſave one, which ever holdeth, which is, that <hi>Princes</hi> do keep due Centinel, that none of their <hi>Neighbours</hi> do over-grow ſo, (by increaſing of Territory, by imbracing of Trade, by Approaches, or the like) as they become more able to annov them, than they were. This is generally the work of ſtanding Counſels to foreſee, and to hinder it. During that <hi>Triumvirate</hi> of <hi>King's, King Henry</hi> the <hi>8th</hi> of <hi>England, Francis</hi> the <hi>1ſt King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>5th Emperour,</hi> there was ſuch a Watch kept, that none of the Three could win a Palm of Ground, but the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Two would ſtraight-ways balance it, either by Confederation, or if need were, by a War, and would not in any wiſe take up Peace at Intereſt. And the like was done by that League, (which <hi>Guicciardine</hi> ſaith, was the Security of <hi>Italy)</hi> made between <hi>Ferdinando</hi> King of <hi>Naples, Lorenzius Medices,</hi> and <hi>Ludovicus Sforza,</hi> Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, the one of <hi>Florence,</hi> the other of <hi>Milain.</hi> Neither is the opinion of ſome of the School-men to be received<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>That a War cannot juſtly be made but upon a precedent Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry or Provocation.</hi> For there is no queſtion, but a juſt Fear of an imminent Danger, though there be no Blow given, is a lawful Cauſe of a War.</p>
                  <p>For their <hi>Wives:</hi> There are cruel examples of them <hi>Livia</hi> is infamed for the poyſoning of her Husband: <hi>Rolaxana, Solyman</hi>'s Wife, was the deſtruction of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned Prince, <hi>Sultan Muſtapha,</hi> and otherwiſe trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled

his Houſe and Succeſſion: <hi>Edward</hi> the Second of <hi>England,</hi> his Queen had the principal hand in the depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and murther of her Husband. This kind of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is then to be feared, chiefly when the <hi>Wives</hi> have Plots for the raiſing of their own Children, or elſe that they be Advoutreſſes.</p>
                  <p>For their <hi>Children:</hi> The Tragedies likewiſe of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers from them have been many. And generally the entring of Fathers into ſuſpicion of their <hi>Children,</hi> hath been ever unfortunate. The deſtruction of <hi>Muſtapha</hi> (that we named before) was ſo fatal to <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Line, as the <hi>Succeſſion</hi> of the <hi>Turks</hi> from <hi>Solyman</hi> until this day, is ſuſpected to be untrue, and of ſtrange blood; for that <hi>Selymus</hi> the ſecond was thought to be ſuppoſititious. The deſtruction of <hi>Criſpus,</hi> a young Prince of rare to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, by <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> the Great, his Father, was in like manner fatal to his Houſe; for both <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> and <hi>Conſtance</hi> his Son died violent Deaths; and <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> his other Son did little better, who died indeed of Sickneſs, but after that <hi>Julianus</hi> had taken Arms againſt him. The deſtruction of <hi>Demetrius,</hi> Son to <hi>Philip</hi> the Second of <hi>Macedon,</hi> turned upon the Father, who died of Repentance. And many like Examples there are, but few or none where the Fathers had good by ſuch diſtruſt, except it were where the Sons were up in open Arms againſt them; as was <hi>Selymus</hi> the firſt againſt <hi>Bajazet,</hi> and the three Sons of <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, King of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For their <hi>Prelates:</hi> When they are proud and great, there is alſo danger from them; as it was in the times of <hi>Anſelmus</hi> and <hi>Thomas Becket,</hi> Arch-Biſhops of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> who with their Croſiers did almoſt try it with the Kings Sword; and yet they had to deal with ſtout and haughty Kings; <hi>William Rufus, Henry</hi> the Firſt, and <hi>Henry</hi> the Second. The danger is not from the <hi>State,</hi> but where it hath a dependance of Foreign Authority; or where the Church-men come in, and are elected, not by the collation of the King, or particular Patrons, but by the People.</p>

For their <hi>Nobles:</hi> To keep them at a diſtance it is not amiſs, but to depreſs them may make a King more ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute, but leſs ſafe, and leſs able to perform any thing that he deſires. I have noted it in my Hiſtory of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, of <hi>England,</hi> who depreſſed his <hi>Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;</hi> whereupon it came to paſs, that his times were full of Difficulties and Troubles; for the <hi>Nobility,</hi> though they continued loyal unto him, yet did they not co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with him in his buſineſs; ſo that in effect he was fain to do all things himſelf.</p>
                  <p>For their <hi>Second Nobles:</hi> There is not much danger from them, being a Body diſperſed. They may ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times diſcourſe high, but that doth little hurt. Beſides they are a counterpoize to the higher <hi>Nobility,</hi> that they grow not too potent: and laſtly, being the moſt imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate in Authority with the Common People, they do beſt temper popular Commotions.</p>
                  <p>For their <hi>Merchants:</hi> They are <hi>Vena porta;</hi> and if they flouriſh not, a Kingdom may have good Limbs, but will have empty Veins, and nouriſh little. Taxes and Impoſts upon them, do ſeldom good to the Kings Revenue; for that he wins in the Hundred, he looſeth in the Shire; the particular Rates being increaſed, but the total bulk of Trading rather decreaſed.</p>
                  <p>For their <hi>Commons:</hi> There is little danger from them, except it be where they have great and potent Heads, or where you meddle with the point of Religion, or their Cuſtoms, or means of Life.</p>
                  <p>For their <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>War:</hi> It is a dangerous State, where they live and remain in a Body, and are uſed to Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, whereof we ſee examples in the <hi>Janizaries</hi> and <hi>Pretorian</hi> Bands of <hi>Rome:</hi> But Trainings of Men, and Arming them in ſeveral places, and under ſeveral Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and without Donatives, are things of Defence, and no danger.</p>

                  <p>THE greateſt truſt between Man and Man is the truſt of <hi>Giving Counſel:</hi> For in other confidences Men commit the parts of Life, their Lands, their Goods, their Children, their Credit, ſome particular Affair: but to ſuch as they make their <hi>Counſellors,</hi> they commit the whole, by how much the more they are obliged to all faith and integrity. The wiſeſt <hi>Princes</hi> need not think it any diminution to their Greatneſs, or derogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to their Sufficiency, to rely upon <hi>Counſel. God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf is not without, but hath made it one of the great Names of his bleſſed Son: The <hi>Counſellor. Solomon</hi> hath pronounced, <hi>that in Counſel is Stability.</hi> Things will have their firſt or ſecond agitation; if they be not toſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon the arguments of <hi>Counſel,</hi> they will be toſſed upon the waves of <hi>Fortune,</hi> and be full of inconſtancy, doing and undoing, like the reeling of a drunken man. <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Son found the force of <hi>Counſel,</hi> as his Father ſaw the neceſſity of it. For the beloved Kingdom of God was firſt rent and broken by ill <hi>Counſel;</hi> upon which <hi>Counſel</hi> there are ſet for inſtruction the two marks, whereby <hi>Bad Counſel</hi> is for ever beſt diſcerned, that it was <hi>young Counſel</hi> for the Perſons, and <hi>violent Counſel</hi> for the Matter.</p>
                  <p>The ancient times do ſet forth in figure, both the incorporation, and inſeparable conjunction of <hi>Counſel</hi> with <hi>Kings,</hi> and the wiſe and politick uſe of <hi>Counſel</hi> by <hi>Kings;</hi> the one in that they ſay, <hi>Jupiter</hi> did marry. <hi>Metis,</hi> which ſignifieth <hi>Counſel,</hi> whereby they intend that

                     <hi>Soveraignty</hi> is married to <hi>Counſel;</hi> the other in that which followeth, which was thus: They ſay, after <hi>Jupiter</hi> was married to <hi>Metis,</hi> ſhe conceived by him, and was with Child: but <hi>Jupiter</hi> ſuffered her not to ſtay till ſhe brought forth, but eat her up; whereby he became himſelf with Child, and was delivered of <hi>Pallas Armed</hi> out of his Head; which monſtrous Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble containeth a ſecret of <hi>Empire,</hi> how <hi>Kings</hi> are to make uſe of their <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>State.</hi> That firſt they ought to refer matters unto them, which is the firſt begetting or impregnation; but when they are elaborate, mould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſhaped in the Womb of their <hi>Council,</hi> and grow ripe, and ready to be brought forth, that then they ſuffer not their <hi>Council</hi> to go through with the reſolution and direction, as if it depended on them; but take the matter back into their own hands, and make it appear to the World, that the Decrees and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Directions (which, becauſe they come forth with <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> are reſembled to <hi>Pallas Armed)</hi> proceeded from themſelves: And not only from their <hi>Authority,</hi> but (the more to add reputation to themſelves) from their <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Device.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us now ſpeak of the <hi>Inconveniencies</hi> of <hi>Counſel,</hi> and of the <hi>Remedies.</hi> The <hi>Inconveniences</hi> that have been noted in calling and uſing <hi>Counſel,</hi> as three: Firſt, the revealing of Affairs, whereby they become leſs ſecret. Secondly, the weakning of the Authority of Princes, as if they were leſs of themſelves. Thirdly, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being unfaithfully <hi>Counſelled,</hi> and more for the good of them that <hi>Counſel,</hi> than of him that is <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled.</hi> For which <hi>Inconveniencies,</hi> the Doctrine of <hi>Italy,</hi> and practice of <hi>France</hi> in ſome Kings times, hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced <hi>Cabinet Councils;</hi> a Remedy worſe than the Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>As to <hi>Secrecy: Princes</hi> are not bound to <hi>communicate</hi> all matters with all <hi>Counſellors,</hi> but extract and ſelect. Neither is it neceſſary, that he that conſulteth what he ſhould do, ſhould declare what he will do. But let
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94631:32"/>
                     <hi>Princes</hi> beware, that the <hi>unſecreting</hi> of their Affairs comes not from themſelves. And as for <hi>Cabinet Counſels,</hi> it may be their <hi>Motto; Plenus rimarum ſum:</hi> One futile Perſon, that maketh it his glory to tell, will do more hurt, than many that know it their duty to conceal. It is true, there be ſome Affairs which require extream <hi>Secrecy,</hi> which will hardly go beyond one or two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons beſide the <hi>King:</hi> Neither are thoſe <hi>Counſels</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſperous; for beſides the <hi>Secrecy,</hi> they commonly go on conſtantly in one Spirit of Direction without di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction. But then it muſt be a prudent King, ſuch as is able to grind with a <hi>Hand-mill;</hi> and thoſe <hi>Inward Counſellors</hi> had need alſo be wiſe Men, and eſpecially true and truſty to the King's ends; as it was with King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh, of <hi>England,</hi> who in his greateſt bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs imparted himſelf to none, except it were to <hi>Morton</hi> and <hi>Fox.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For <hi>weakning of Authority:</hi> The Fable ſheweth the <hi>Remedy.</hi> Nay, the Majeſty of King's is rather exalted than diminiſhed, when they are in the Chair of <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel.</hi> Neither was there ever <hi>Prince</hi> bereaved of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendencies by his <hi>Counſel,</hi> except where there hath been either an over-greatneſs in one <hi>Counſellor,</hi> or an over-ſtrict combination in divers, which are things ſoon found and holpen.</p>
                  <p>For the laſt <hi>Inconvenience,</hi> that Men will <hi>Counſel with an Eye to themſelves:</hi> Certainly, <hi>Non inveniet fidem ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per terram,</hi> is meant of the nature of times, and not of all particular Perſons. There be, that are in nature, faithful and ſincere, and plain, and direct, not crafty and involved: Let <hi>Princes</hi> above all draw to themſelves ſuch natures. Beſides <hi>Counſellors</hi> are not commonly ſo united, but that one <hi>Counſellor</hi> keepeth Centinel over another; ſo that if any do <hi>Counſel,</hi> out of faction, or private ends, it commonly comes to the King's Ear. But the beſt <hi>Remedy</hi> is, if <hi>Princes</hi> know their <hi>Counſellors</hi> as well as their <hi>Counſellors</hi> know them:

                  </p>
                  <p>And on the other ſide, <hi>Counſellors</hi> ſhould not be too ſpeculative into their Soveraigns Perſon. The true compoſition of a <hi>Counſellor,</hi> is rather to be skill'd in their Maſters buſineſs, than in his Nature; for then he is like to adviſe him, and not to feed his humour. It is of ſingular uſe to <hi>Princes,</hi> if they take the Opinions of their <hi>Counſel,</hi> both ſeparately and together. For pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate opinion is more free, but opinion before others is more reverend. In private, Men are more bold in their own humours; and in conſort, Men are more obnoxious to others humours: therefore it is good to take both. And of the inferiour ſort, rather in private, to preſerve freedom; of the greater, rather in conſort, to preſerve reſpect. It is vain for <hi>Princes</hi> to take <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel,</hi> concerning <hi>Matters,</hi> if they take no <hi>Counſel</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe concerning <hi>Perſons:</hi> for all <hi>Matters</hi> are as dead Images; and the life of the execution of Affairs reſteth in the good choice of <hi>Perſons.</hi> Neither is it enough to conſult concerning Perſons, <hi>ſecundum genera,</hi> as in an <hi>Idea</hi> or <hi>Mathematical Deſcription,</hi> what the kind and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the <hi>Perſon</hi> ſhould be; for the greateſt errors are committed, and the moſt judgment is ſhewn in the choice of <hi>Individuals.</hi> It was truly ſaid, <hi>Optimi Conſili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arii mortui; Books</hi> will ſpeak plain when <hi>Counſellors</hi> blanch.

                  <p>The <hi>Councils</hi> at this day in moſt places are but fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar meetings, where matters are rather talked on than debated.

commend ſet days for Petitions: for it gives both the Suitors more certainty for their attendance, and it frees the meetings for matters of Eſtate, that they may <hi>Hoc agere.</hi> In choice of Committees for ripening Buſineſs for the <hi>Council,</hi> it is better to chuſe indifferent Perſons, than to make an Indifferency, by putting in thoſe that are ſtrong on both ſides. I commend alſo ſtanding <hi>Commiſſions;</hi> as for Trade, for Treaſure, for War, for Suits, for ſome Provinces: For where there be divers particular <hi>Councils,</hi> and but one <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> (as it is in <hi>Spain)</hi> they are in effect no more than ſtanding <hi>Commiſſions;</hi> ſave that they have greater Authority. Let ſuch as are to inform <hi>Councils</hi> out of their particular Profeſſions (as Lawyers, Sea-men, Mint-men, and the like) be firſt heard before <hi>Committees,</hi> and then, as occaſion ſerves, before the <hi>Council.</hi> And let them not come in multitudes, or in a Tribunitious manner; for that is to clamour <hi>Councils,</hi> not to inform them. A long Table, and a ſquare Table, or Seats about the Walls, ſeem things of Form, but are things of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; for at a long Table, a few at the upper end in effect ſway all the buſineſs; but in the other Form, there is more uſe of the <hi>Counſellors</hi> Opinions that ſit lower. A <hi>King,</hi> when he preſides in <hi>Council,</hi> let him beware how he opens his own inclination too much in that which he propoundeth; for elſe <hi>Counſellors</hi> will but take the wind of him, and inſtead of giving <hi>Free Counſel,</hi> ſing him a Song of <hi>Placebo.</hi>

Again, it is one thing to underſtand Perſons, and another thing to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Matters; for many are perfect in Mens Humours, that are not greatly capable of the real part of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, which is the Conſtitution of one that hath ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died Men more than Books.

And becauſe theſe <hi>Cunning Men</hi> are like Haberdaſhers of ſmall Wares, it is not amiſs to ſet forth their ſhop.</p>
                  <p>It is a point of <hi>Cunning</hi> to wait upon him, with whom you ſpeak, with your eye, as the Jeſuits give it in precept: For there may be many wiſe men that have ſecret Hearts and tranſparent Countenances.

                  <p>It is a way that ſome men have to glance and dart at others, by juſtifying themſelves by Negatives; as to ſay, <hi>This I did not:</hi> As <hi>Tigellinus</hi> did towards <hi>Burrhus; Se non diverſas ſpes, ſed incolumitatem Imperatoris ſimpliciter ſpectare.</hi>

It is true, that what is ſettled by cuſtom, though it be not good, yet at leaſt it is fit.

Therefore meaſure not diſpatch by the times of ſitting, but by the advancement of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And as in Races, it is not the large Stride, or high Lift that makes the Speed; ſo in buſineſs, the keeping cloſe to the matter, and not taking of it too much at once, procureth <hi>Diſpatch.</hi> It is the care of ſome only to come off ſpeedily for the time, or to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive ſome falſe periods of buſineſs, becauſe they may ſeem <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Diſpatch.</hi> But it is one thing to abbreviate by contracting, another by cutting off; and buſineſs ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at ſeveral ſittings or meetings, goeth commonly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:94631:38"/>
backward or forward in an unſteady manner. I knew a <hi>Wiſe Man,</hi> that had it for a by-word, when he ſaw men haſten to a Concluſion; <hi>Stay a little, that we may make an end the ſooner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, <hi>True Diſpatch</hi> is a rich thing. For Time is the meaſure of Buſineſs, as Money is of Wares; and buſineſs is bought at a dear hand, where there is ſmall <hi>Diſpatch.</hi> The <hi>Spartans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> have been noted to be of ſmall <hi>Diſpatch, Mivenga la Muerte de Spagna, Let my death come from</hi> Spain, for then it will be ſure to be long in coming.</p>
                  <p>Give good hearing to thoſe that give the firſt Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in Buſineſs; and rather direct them in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, than interrupt them in the continuance of their Speeches: for he that is put out of his own order, will go forward and backward, and more tedious while he waits upon his memory, than he could have been, if he had gone on in his own courſe. But ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is ſeen, that the Moderator is more trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome than the Actor.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Iterations</hi> are commonly loſs of time; but there is no ſuch gain of time, as to <hi>iterate</hi> often the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>Queſtion;</hi> for it chaſeth away many a frivolous Speech as it is coming forth. Long and curious Speeches are as fit for <hi>Diſpatch,</hi> as a Robe or Mantle with a long train is for a Race.</p>
                  <p>Prefaces, and Paſſages, and Excuſations, and other Speeches of reference to the Perſon, are great waſters of time; and though they ſeem to proceed of modeſty, they are bravery. Yet beware of being too material, when there is any impediment or obſtruction in mens Wills; for pre-occupation of mind ever requireth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face of Speech, like a fomentation to make the unguent enter.</p>
                  <p>Above all things, <hi>Order,</hi> and <hi>Distribution,</hi> and <hi>Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> out of <hi>Parts,</hi> is the life of <hi>Diſpatch:</hi> ſo as the <hi>Diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution</hi> be not too ſubtle; for he that both not divide, will never enter well into buſineſs: and he that divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:94631:38"/>
too much will never come out of it clearly. To chuſe time, is to ſave time, and an unſeaſonable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is but beating the Air. There be three parts of Buſineſs; the <hi>Preparation, the Debate</hi> or <hi>Examination,</hi> and the <hi>Perfection;</hi> whereof if you look for <hi>Diſpatch,</hi> let the middle only be the work of many, and the firſt and laſt the work of few. The proceeding upon ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what conceived in writing, doth for the moſt part fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate <hi>Diſpatch:</hi> for though it ſhould be wholly reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet that <hi>Negative</hi> is more pregnant of direction, than an <hi>Indefinite;</hi> as Aſhes are more generative than Duſt.</p>

                  <head>XXVII. Of Friendſhip.</head>
                  <p>IT had been hard for him that ſpake it, to have put more truth and untruth together in few words, than in that Speech, <hi>Whoſoever is delighted in ſolitude, is either a wild Beaſt, or a God.</hi> For it is moſt true, that a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and ſecret hatred, and averſation towards <hi>Society</hi> in any Man, hath ſomewhat of the ſavage Beaſt; but it is moſt untrue, that it ſhould have any character at all of the Divine Nature, except it proceed not out of a pleaſure in <hi>Solitude,</hi> but out of a love and deſire to ſequeſter a mans ſelf for a higher converſation; ſuch as is found to have been falſly and feignedly in ſome of the Heathen, as <hi>Epimenides</hi> the <hi>Candian, Numa</hi> the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Empedocles</hi> the <hi>Sicilian,</hi> and <hi>Apollonius</hi> of <hi>Tyana;</hi> and truly and really in divers of the ancient Hermits and Holy Fathers of the Church. But little do men perceive what <hi>Solitude</hi> is, and how far it extendeth: for a Crown is not Company, and Faces are but a Gallery of Pictures, and Talk but a <hi>Thinking Cymbal,</hi> where there is no <hi>Love.</hi> The Latine Adage meeteth with it a little, <hi>Magna Civitas, magna ſolitudo;</hi> becauſe in a great Town <hi>Friends</hi> are ſcattered, ſo that there is not that fellowſhip, for the moſt part, which is in leſs <hi>Neighbourhoods.</hi> But we may go further, and affirm moſt truly, that is a meer and miſerable <hi>ſolitude</hi> to want <hi>Friends,</hi> without which the World is but a Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and even in this Senſe alſo of <hi>Solitude,</hi> whoſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in the Frame of his Nature and Affections is unfit for <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> he taketh it of the Beaſt, and not from Humanity.</p>
                  <p>A Principal <hi>Fruit</hi> of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> is, the Eaſe and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Fulneſs and Swellings of the Heart, which Paſſions of all kinds do cauſe and induce. We know
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:94631:40"/>
Diſeaſes of Stoppings and Suffocations are the moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in the Body, and it is not much otherwiſe in Mind: You may take <hi>Sarza</hi> to open the Liver, <hi>Steel</hi> to open the Spleen, <hi>Flower</hi> of <hi>Sulphur</hi> for the Lungs, <hi>Caſtoreum</hi> for the Brain; but no Receipt openeth the Heart, but a true Friend, to whom you may impart Griefs, Joys, Fears, Hopes, Suſpicions, Counſels, and whatſoever lieth upon the Heart to oppreſs it, in a kind of Civil Shrift or Confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>It is a ſtrange thing to obſerve, how high a Rate great Kings and Monarchs do ſet upon this <hi>Fruit</hi> of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> whereof we ſpeak; ſo great, as they purchaſe it many times at the hazard of their own Safety and Greatneſs. For Princes, in regard of the diſtance of their Fortune from that of their Subjects and Servant, cannot gather this Fruit except (to make themſelves capable thereof) they raiſe ſome Perſons to be, as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     <hi>more men adored the Sun-riſing than the Sun-ſetting.</hi> With <hi>Julius, Decius Brutus</hi> had obtained that Intereſt, as he ſet him down in his Teſtament, for Heir in Remainder after his <hi>Nephew.</hi> And this was the man that had power with him, to draw him forth to his Death. For when <hi>Caeſar</hi> would have diſcharged the Senate, in regard of ſome ill preſages, and eſpecially a Dream of <hi>Calpurnia;</hi> This man lifted him gently by the Arm out of his Chair, telling him, he hoped he would not diſmiſs the Senate, till his Wife had dreamed a better Dream. And it ſeemeth his favour was ſo great, as <hi>Antonius</hi> in a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is recited <hi>verbatim</hi> in one of <hi>Cicero</hi>'s <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques,</hi> called him <hi>Venefica, Witch;</hi> as if he had enchanted <hi>Caeſar. Auguſtus</hi> raiſed <hi>Agrippa</hi> (though of mean Birth) to that Heighth, as when he conſulted with <hi>Moecenas</hi> about the Marriage of his Daughter <hi>Julia, Moecenas</hi> took the Liberty to tell him, <hi>That he must either marry his Daughter to</hi> Agrippa, <hi>or take away his Life; there was no third way, he had made him ſo great.</hi> With <hi>Tiberius Caeſar, Sejanus</hi> had aſcended to that Heighth, as they two were termed and reckoned as a pair of Friends. <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berius</hi> in a Letter to him, ſaith, <hi>Hac pro Amicitia noſtra non occultavi;</hi> and the whole Senate dedicated an Altar to <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> as to a <hi>Goddeſs,</hi> in reſpect of the great Dearneſs of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> between them two. The like or more was between <hi>Septimius Severus</hi> and <hi>Plantianus;</hi> for he forced his eldeſt Son to marry the Daughter of <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianus,</hi> and would maintain <hi>Plantianus</hi> in doing affronts to his Son, and did write alſo in a Letter to the Senate theſe words; <hi>I love the man ſo well, as I wiſh he may over love me.</hi> Now if theſe Princes had been as a <hi>Trajan,</hi> or a <hi>Marcus Aurelius,</hi> a Man might have thought, that this had proceeded of an abundant Goodneſs of Nature; but being men ſo Wiſe, of ſuch ſtrength and ſeverity of Mind, and ſo extream Lovers of themſelves, as all theſe were; it proveth moſt plainly, that they found their own Felicity (though as great as ever happened to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal man) but as an half Piece, except they might have
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:94631:41"/>
a <hi>Friend</hi> to make it Entire; and yet, which is more, they were <hi>Princes</hi> that had Wives, Sons, Nephews, and yet all theſe could not ſupply the Comfort of <hi>Friendſhip.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not to be forgotten, what <hi>Commines</hi> obſerveth of his Maſter, <hi>Duke Charles</hi> the <hi>Hardy;</hi> namely, That he would communicate his Secrets with none; and leaſt of all thoſe Secrets which troubled him moſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon he goeth on, and ſaith, that towards his latter time; <hi>That cloſeneſs did impair, and a little periſh his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi> Surely, <hi>Commines</hi> might have made the ſame Judgment alſo, if it had pleaſed him, of his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Maſter, <hi>Lewis</hi> the Eleventh, whoſe Cloſeneſs was indeed his Tormentor. The Parable of <hi>Pythagoras</hi> is dark, but true, <hi>Cor ne edito, Eat not the Heart.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if a man would give it a hard Phraſe, thoſe that want <hi>Friends</hi> to open themſelves unto, are Cannibals of their own <hi>Hearts.</hi> But one thing is moſt admirable, (wherewith I will conclude this firſt <hi>Fruit</hi> of <hi>Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,)</hi> which is, That this Communicating of a Man's Self to a <hi>Friend,</hi> works two contrary effects; for it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubleth <hi>Joys,</hi> and cutteth <hi>Griefs</hi> in Halfs; for there is no man that imparteth his <hi>Joys</hi> to his <hi>Friend,</hi> but he <hi>Joyeth</hi> the more; and no man that imparteth his <hi>Griefs</hi> to his <hi>Friend,</hi> but he <hi>grieveth</hi> the leſs. So that it is in truth an Operation upon a Man's mind of like virtue, as the <hi>Alchymiſts</hi> uſe to attribute to their Stone for Man's Body, that it worketh all contrary effects, but ſtill to the Good and Benefit of Nature; but yet without bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Aid of <hi>Alchymiſts,</hi> there is a manifeſt Image of this in the ordinary courſe of Nature: For in Bodies <hi>Union</hi> ſtrengthneth and cheriſheth any natural Action; and on the other ſide, weakneth and dulleth any vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Imperſſion; and even ſo it is of Minds.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond <hi>Fruit</hi> of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> is Healthful and Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign for the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> as the firſt is for the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: for <hi>Friendſhip</hi> maketh indeed a <hi>fair Day</hi> in the <hi>Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> from Storm and Tempeſts; but it maketh <hi>Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi> in the <hi>Affections</hi> from Tempeſts; but it maketh <hi>Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light</hi>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:94631:41"/>
in the <hi>Underſtanding</hi> out of Darkneſs and Confuſion of Thoughts. Neither is this to be underſtood only of Faithful Counſel which a man receiveth from his <hi>Friend:</hi> but before you come to that, certain it is, that whoſoever hath his Mind fraught with many Thoughts, his Wits and Underſtanding do clarifie and break up in the Communicating and Diſcourſing with another; he toſſeth his Thoughts more eaſily, he marſhalleth them more orderly, he ſeeth how they look when they are turned into words. Finally, he waxeth wiſer than Himſelf; and that more by an hours Diſcourſe, than by a days Meditation. It was well ſaid by <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> to the King of <hi>Perſia, That Speech was like Cloth of Arras opened and put abroad; whereby the Imagery doth appear in Figure, whereas in Thoughts they lie but as in Packs.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this ſecond <hi>Fruit</hi> of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> in opening the <hi>Underſtanding,</hi> reſtrained only to ſuch <hi>Friends</hi> as are able to give a Man Counſel; (they indeed are beſt) but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven without that a Man learneth of himſelf, and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his own Thoughts to Light, and whetteth his Wits as againſt a Stone, which its ſelf cuts not. In a word, a Man were better relate himſelf to a Statue or Picture, than to ſuffer his Thoughts to paſs in ſmother.</p>
                  <p>And now, to make this ſecond <hi>Fruit</hi> of <hi>Friendſhip</hi> compleat, that other Point which lieth open, and fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth within Vulgar Obſervation, which is <hi>Faithful Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel</hi> from a <hi>Friend. Heraclitus</hi> ſaith well in one of his Aenigma's; <hi>Dry Light is ever the best.</hi> And certain it is, that the Light that a Man receiveth by <hi>Counſel</hi> from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, is drier and purer than that which cometh from his own <hi>Underſtanding</hi> and <hi>Judgment,</hi> which is ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and drenched in his <hi>Affections</hi> and Cuſtoms, ſo as there is as much difference between the <hi>Counſel</hi> that a <hi>Friend</hi> giveth, and that a man giveth himſelf, as there is between the <hi>Counſel</hi> of a <hi>Friend,</hi> and of a <hi>Flatterer;</hi> for there is no ſuch <hi>Flatterer</hi> as in a Man's Self; and there is no ſuch remedy againſt <hi>Flattery</hi> of a man's ſelf, as the liberty of a <hi>Friend. Counſel</hi> is of two ſorts; the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:94631:42"/>
one concerning <hi>Manners,</hi> the other concerning <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> For the firſt; the beſt preſervative to keep the Mind in Health, is the faithful Admonition of a <hi>Friend.</hi> The calling of a Man's ſelf to a ſtrict account is a Medicine ſometime too piercing and Corroſive. Reading good Books of Morality, is a little Flat and Dead. Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Faults in others, is ſometimes unproper for our caſe. But the beſt Receipt (beſt, I ſay) to work, and beſt to take, is the Admonition of a <hi>Friend.</hi> It is a ſtrange thing to behold, what groſs Errors, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream abſurdities many (eſpecially of the greater ſort) do commit, for want of a <hi>Friend</hi> to tell them of them, to the great damage both of their Fame and Fortune: for, as St. <hi>James</hi> ſaith, they were as Men <hi>that look ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times into a Glaſs, and preſently forget their own ſhape and favour.</hi> As for <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> a man may think, if he will, that two Eyes ſee no more than one; or that a Game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſeeth always more than a Looker on; or that a Man in Anger is as wiſe as he that hath ſaid over the four and twenty Letters; or that a Musket may be ſhot off as well upon the Arm, as upon a Reſt; and ſuch other fond and high Imaginations, to think himſelf All in All. But when all is done, the help of good <hi>Counſel</hi> is that which ſetteth Buſineſs ſtreight; and if any man think that he will take <hi>Counſel,</hi> but it ſhall be by pieces, asking <hi>Counſel</hi> in one buſineſs of one man, and in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther buſineſs of another man; it is well, (that is to ſay, better perhaps than if he asked none at all) but he run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth two dangers; one, that he ſhall not faithfully be Counſelled; for it is a rare thing, except it be from a perfect and entire <hi>Friend,</hi> to have <hi>Counſel</hi> given, but ſuch as ſhall be bowed and crooked to ſome ends, which he hath that giveth it. The other, that he ſhall have <hi>Counſel</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, hurtful and unſafe, (though with good meaning) and mixt; partly of miſchief, and partly of remedy: even as if you would call a Phyſician, that is thought good for the Cure of the Diſeaſe you complain of, but is unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with your Body; and therefore may put you
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:94631:42"/>
in a way for preſent Cure, but overthroweth your Health in ſome other kind, and ſo cure the Diſeaſe, and kill the Patient. But a <hi>Friend</hi> that is wholly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a Man's Eſtate, will beware by furthering any preſent <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> how he daſheth upon other Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience; and therefore reſts not upon <hi>ſcattered Counſels,</hi> for they will rather diſtract and miſ-lead, than ſettle and direct.</p>
                  <p>After theſe two noble <hi>Fruits</hi> of <hi>Friendſhip, (Peace in the Affections,</hi> and <hi>Support of the Judgment)</hi> followeth the laſt <hi>Fruit</hi> which is like the <hi>Pomegranate,</hi> full of many kernels; I mean <hi>Aid,</hi> and <hi>Bearing a part</hi> in all <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Occaſions.</hi> Here the beſt way to repreſent to the life the manifold uſe of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> is to caſt and ſee, how many things there are, which a man cannot do him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and then it will appear, that it was a ſparing Speech of the Ancients, to ſay, <hi>That a Friend is another himſelf;</hi> for that a <hi>Friend</hi> is far more than <hi>himſelf.</hi> Men have their time, and die many times in deſire of ſome things, which they principally take to <hi>heart;</hi> The beſtowing of a Child, the finiſhing of a work, or the like. If a Man have a true <hi>Friend,</hi> he may reſt almoſt ſecure, that the care of thoſe things will continue after him: ſo that a Man hath as it were two Lives in his deſires. A Man hath a Body, and that Body is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to a place; but where <hi>Friendſhip</hi> is, all Offices of Life are as it were granted to him and his Deputy; for he may exerciſe them by his <hi>Friend.</hi> How many things are there, which a Man cannot, with any face or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, ſay or do himſelf? A man can ſcarce alledge his own merits with modeſty, much leſs extol them: A man cannot ſometimes brook to ſupplicate or beg; and a number of the like. But all theſe things are grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in a <hi>Friend's</hi> mouth, which are bluſhing in a man's own. So again, a man's Perſon hath many proper Relations, which he cannot put off. A man cannot ſpeak to his Son, but as a Father; to his Wife but as a Husband; to his Enemy, but upon terms. Whereas a

                     <hi>RICHES</hi> are for ſpending, and ſpending for Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and good Actions: Therefore <hi>Extraordinary Expence</hi> muſt be limited by the worth of the occaſion. For <hi>Voluntary Undoing</hi> may be as well for a man's <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</hi> as for the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> but <hi>Ordinary Expence</hi> ought to be limited by a Man's Eſtate, and governed with ſuch regard, as it be within his compaſs, and not ſubject to deceit and abuſe of Servants, and ordered to the beſt ſhew, that the Bills may be leſs than the Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation abroad. Certainly, if a man will keep but of even hand, his <hi>Ordinary Expences</hi> ought to be but to the half of his Receipts: And if he think to wax Rich, but to the third part. It is no baſeneſs for the greateſt to deſcend and look into their own <hi>Eſtate.</hi> Some forbear it, not upon negligence alone, but doubting to bring themſelves into melancholy, in reſpect they ſhall find it broken; but Wounds cannot be cured without ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. He that cannot look into his own Eſtate at all, had need both chuſe well thoſe whom he employeth, and change them oftner; for new are more timorous, and leſs ſubtle. He that can look into his Eſtate but ſeldom, it behoveth him to turn all to certainty. A man had need, if he be plentiful in ſome kind of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence,</hi> to be as ſaving again in ſome other: as if he be plentiful in Diet, to be ſaving in Apparel: If he be plentiful in the Hall, to be ſaving in the Stable, and the like. For he that is plentiful in <hi>Expences</hi> of all kinds,

For haſty Selling is commonly as diſadvantageous as Intereſt. Beſides, he that clears at once will relapſe; for fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding himſelf out of ſtreights, he will revert to his cuſtoms: But he that cleareth by degrees, induceth a habit of frugality, and gaineth as well upon his mind as upon his Eſtate. Certainly, who hath a State to repair, may not deſpiſe ſmall things: and commonly it is leſs diſhonourable to abridge petty Charges, than to ſtoop to petty Gettings. A man ought warily to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin Charges, which once begun will continue; but in matters that return not, he may be more magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.</p>

the other way, to bring a great and flouriſhing Eſtate to ruine and decay.

There are alſo (no doubt) Counſellors and Governours which may be held ſufficient <hi>(Negotiis pares)</hi> able to manage Affairs, and to keep them from <hi>Precipices,</hi> and manifeſt inconveniences, which nevertheleſs are far from the ability to raiſe and amplifie an Eſtate in power, means, and fortune. But be the Workmen what they may be, let us ſpeak of the Work; That is, the <hi>true Greatneſs of Kingdoms and Eſtates,</hi> and the <hi>Means</hi> thereof. An Argument fit for Great and Mighty Princes to have in their hand, to the end, that neither by over-meaſuring their Forces, they leeſe themſelves in vain Enterpriſes; nor on the other ſide, by undervaluing them, they deſcend to fearful and puſillanimous <hi>Counſels.</hi>

Walled Towns, Stored Arſenals and Armouries, Goodly Races of Horſe, Chariots of War, Elephants, Ordnance, Artillery, and the like: All this is but a Sheep in a Lions skin, except the breed and diſpoſition of the People be ſtout and warlike.

                  </p>
                  <p>Let States that aim at <hi>Greatneſs</hi> take heed how their <hi>Nobility</hi> and <hi>Gentlemen</hi> do multiply too faſt: For that maketh the Common Subject grow to be a Peaſant, and a baſe Swain, driven out of Heart, and in effect but a <hi>Gentlemans</hi> Laborour: even as you may ſee in Coppice Woods. <hi>If you leave your Stadles too thick, you ſhall never have clean Underwood, but Shrubs and Buſhes.</hi> So in <hi>Countries,</hi> if the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> be too many, the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> will be baſe: and you will bring it to that, that not the hundredth Poll will be fit for an Helmet; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as to the <hi>Infantry,</hi> which is the Nerve of an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and ſo there will be great Population and little Strength.

                  <p>By all means it is to be procured, that the <hi>Trunk</hi> of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Tree of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> be great enough to bear the Branches, and the Boughs; that is, That the <hi>Natural Subjects</hi> of the Crown or State, bear a ſufficient Proportion to the <hi>Stranger Subjects</hi> that they govern. Therefore all States that are liberal of Naturalization towards Strangers are fit for <hi>Empire.</hi> For to think that an Handful of People can with the greateſt Courage and Policy in the World, embrace too large extent of Dominion, it may hold for a time, but it will fail ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly. The <hi>Spartans</hi> were a nice People in point of Naturalization; whereby, while they kept their compaſs they ſtood firm; but when they did ſpread, and their Boughs were become too great for their Stem, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Wind-fall upon the ſudden. Never any State was in this Point ſo open to receive <hi>Strangers</hi> into their Body, as were the <hi>Romans,</hi> therefore it ſorted with them accordingly: for they grew to the greateſt <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy.</hi> Their manner was to grant Naturalization, (which they called <hi>Jus Civitatis)</hi> and to grant it in the
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:94631:46"/>
higheſt Degree; that is, not only <hi>Jus Commercii, Jus Connubii, Jus Haereditatis,</hi> but alſo <hi>Jus ſuffragii,</hi> and <hi>Jus Honorum.</hi> And this, not to ſingular Perſons alone, but likewiſe to whole Families; yea, to Cities, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to Nations. Add to this their Cuſtom of <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> of <hi>Colonies,</hi> whereby the <hi>Roman</hi> Plant was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved into the Soyl of other Nations; and putting both Conſtitutions together, you will ſay, that it was not the <hi>Romans</hi> that ſpread upon the <hi>World,</hi> but it was the <hi>World</hi> that ſpread upon the <hi>Romans;</hi> and that was the ſure Way of <hi>Greatneſs.</hi> I have marvelled ſometimes at <hi>Spain,</hi> how they claſp and contain ſo large Dominions with ſo few natural <hi>Spaniards:</hi> but ſure the whole Compaſs of <hi>Spain</hi> is a very great Body of a Tree, far above <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Sparta</hi> at the firſt: and beſides, though they have not had that uſage to Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralize liberally, yet they have that which is next to it; that is, <hi>To employ, almoſt indifferently, all Nations in their Militia of ordinary Soldiers:</hi> yea, and ſometimes in their <hi>Higheſt Commands.</hi> Nay, it ſeemeth at this inſtant, they are ſenſible of this want of Natives, as by the <hi>Pragmatical Sanction,</hi> now publiſhed, appeareth.</p>
                  <p>It is certain, that <hi>Sedentary</hi> and <hi>Within-door Arts,</hi> and delicate Manufactures, (that require rather the Finger, than the Arm) have in their Nature a Contrariety to a Military diſpoſition. And generally all Warlike People are a little idle, and love Danger better than Travel: neither muſt they be too much broken of it, if they ſhall be preſerved in vigour. Therefore it was great Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the Ancient States of <hi>Sparta, Athens, Rome,</hi> and others, that they had the uſe of <hi>Slaves,</hi> which commonly did rid thoſe Manufactures: but that is aboliſhed in greateſt part by the <hi>Chriſtian Law.</hi> That which cometh neareſt to it, is to leave thoſe Arts chiefly to Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers (which for that purpoſe are the more eaſily to be received) and to contain the principal Bulk of the vulgar Natives within thoſe three kinds; <hi>Tillers</hi> of the Ground, <hi>Free Servants,</hi> and <hi>Handicrafts</hi> Men of ſtrong
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94631:46"/>
and manly Arts; as Smiths, Maſons, Carpenters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not rekoning profeſſed Soldiers.</p>
                  <p>But above all, for <hi>Empire</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs</hi> it importeth moſt, that a Nation do profeſs Arms as their principal Honour: Study and Occupation: for the things which we formerly have ſpoken of, are but <hi>Habilitations</hi> towards Arms; and what is <hi>Habilitation,</hi> without <hi>Intention</hi> and <hi>Act? Romulus</hi> after his death (as they report or feign) ſent a preſent to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that above all they ſhould intend Arms, and then they ſhould prove the greateſt <hi>Empire</hi> of the world. The fabrick of the <hi>State</hi> of <hi>Sparta</hi> was wholly (though not wiſely) framed and compoſed to that Scope and End. The <hi>Perſians</hi> and <hi>Macedonians</hi> had it for a flaſh. The <hi>Galls, Germans, Goths, Saxons, Normans,</hi> and others had it for a time. The <hi>Turks</hi> have it at this day, though in great Declination. Of Chriſtian <hi>Europe,</hi> they that have it, are in effect only the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> But it is ſo plain, <hi>That every Man profiteth in that he moſt intendeth,</hi> that it needeth not to be ſtood upon. It is enough to point at it, that no Nation which doth not directly profeſs Arms, may look to have <hi>Greatneſs</hi> fall into their mouths. And on the other ſide, it is a moſt certain Oracle of Time, that thoſe States that continue long in that profeſſion (as the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Turks</hi> principally have done) do won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; and thoſe that have profeſſed Arms but for an Age, have notwithſtanding commonly attained that <hi>Greatneſs</hi> in that Age, which maintained them long after, when their Profeſſion and exerciſe of Arms are grown to decay.</p>
                  <p>Incident to this Point is, for a State to have thoſe Laws or Cuſtoms which may reach forth unto them juſt Occaſions (as may be pretended) of War: for there is that juſtice imprinted in the Nature of Men, that they enter not upon Wars (whereof ſo many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities do enſue) but upon ſome, or at leaſt ſpecious Grounds and Quarrels. The <hi>Turk</hi> hath at hand, for cauſe of War, the Propagation of his Law or Sect, a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:94631:47"/>
Quarrel that he may always command. The <hi>Romans,</hi> though they eſteemed the extending the Limits of their Empire to be great Honour to their Generals, when it was done; yet they never reſted upon that alone to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin a War. Firſt therefore, let Nations that pretend to <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> have this; that they be ſenſible of wrongs, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon Borders, Merchants, or Politick Miniſters, and that they ſit not too long upon a Provocation. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, let them be preſt, and ready to give Aids and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours to their Confederates; as it ever was with the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans:</hi> Inſomuch as if the Confederate had Leagues defenſive with divers others States, and upon Invaſion offered, did deplore their Aids ſeverally; yet the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> would ever be the foremoſt, and leave it to none other to have the Honour. As for the Wars which were anciently made on the behalf of a kind of Party, or tacit Conformity of Eſtate, I do not well ſay, how they may be well juſtified: As when the <hi>Romans</hi> made a War for the Liberty of <hi>Graecia;</hi> or when the <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>edae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians</hi> and <hi>Athenians</hi> made Wars to ſet up or pull down <hi>Democracies</hi> and <hi>Oligarchies;</hi> or when Wars were made by Foreigners, under the pretence of Juſtice or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, to deliver the Subjects of others from Tyranny and Oppreſſion, and the like. Let it ſuffice, That no Eſtate expect to be <hi>Great,</hi> that is not awake, upon any juſt Occaſion of Arming.</p>
                  <p>No Body can be Healthful without <hi>Exerciſe,</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Natural Body, nor Politick; and certainly to a <hi>Kingdom</hi> or <hi>Eſtate,</hi> a juſt and Honourable War is the true <hi>Exerciſe.</hi> A Civil War indeed is like the Heat of a Fever; but a Foreign War is like the Heat of <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,</hi> and ſerveth to keep the Body in health: for in a ſlothful Peace both Courages will effeminate, and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners corrupt. But howſoever it be for Happineſs with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all Queſtion; for <hi>Greatneſs,</hi> it maketh to be ſtill, for the moſt part in Arms; and the ſtrength of a Veterane Army (though it be a chargeable Buſineſs) always on Foot, is that which commonly giveth the

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:94631:48"/>
for thoſe that died in the Wars; the Crowns and Garlands perſonal; the Style of Emperor, which the great King of the World after borrowed; the Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of the Generals upon their Return; the great Donatives and Largeſſes upon the Disbanding of the Armies, were things able to enflame all mens Courages. But above all, that of the Triumph amongſt the <hi>Romans,</hi> was not Pageant or Gaudary, but one of the Wiſeſt and Nobleſt Inſtitutions that ever was: for it contained three things: Honour to the General; Riches to the Treaſury out of the Spoil; and Donatives to the Army. But that Honour perhaps were not fit for <hi>Monarchies,</hi> except it be in the Perſon of the <hi>Monarch</hi> himſelf, or his Sons; as it came to paſs in the times of the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,</hi> who did impropriate the Actual Triumphs to themſelves, and their Sons, for ſuch Wars as they did atchieve in Perſons; and left only for Wars atchieved by Subjects, ſome Triumphal Garments and Enſigns to the General.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, No Man can, by <hi>Care taking</hi> (as the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſaith) <hi>add a cubit to his Stature,</hi> in this little Model of a <hi>Mans Body;</hi> but in the great Frame of <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms</hi> and <hi>Common-wealths,</hi> it is in the power of Princes or Eſtates to add Amplitude and <hi>Greatneſs</hi> to their <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms.</hi> For by introducing ſuch Ordinances, Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Cuſtoms, as we have now touched, they may ſow <hi>Greatneſs</hi> to their Poſterity and Succeſſion.

But it is a ſafer concluſion to ſay, <hi>This agreeth not well with me, therefore I will not continue it,</hi> than this, <hi>I find no offence of this, therefore I may uſe it.</hi> For ſtrength of Nature in Youth paſſeth over many Exceſſes which are owing by a Man till his Age. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of the coming on of years, and think not to do the ſame things ſtill; for Age will not be defied. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of ſudden change in any great point of Diet; and if neceſſity inforce it, fit the reſt to it: For it is a ſecret both in Nature and State, that it is ſafer to change many things than one. Examine thy Cuſtoms of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, Sleep, Exerciſe, Apparel, and the like: And try in any thing thou ſhalt judge hurtful, to diſcontinue it by little and little; but ſo, as if thou doſt find any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience by the change, thou come back to it again: For it is hard to diſtinguiſh that which is generally held good and wholeſome, from that which is good particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, and fit for a mans own Body. To befree mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and chearfully diſpoſed at hours of Meat, and of Sleep, and of Exerciſe, is one of the beſt precepts for long Life. As for the Paſſions and Studies of the Mind; avoid envy, anxious Fears, Anger fretting inwards, ſubtil and knotty Inquiſitions, Joys, and Exhilarations in Exceſs, Sadneſs not communicated; entertain Hopes, Mirth rather than Joy, variety of Delights, rather than Surfeit of them, Wonder and Admiration, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Novelties, Studies that ſill the mind with ſplendid and illuſtrious Objects, as Hiſtories, Fables, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations of Nature. If you fly Phyſick in <hi>Health</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, it will be too ſtrange for your Body when you ſhall need it. If you make it too familiar, it will work no extraordinary effect when Sickneſs cometh. I commend rather ſome Diet for certain Seaſons, than frequent uſe of <hi>Phyſick,</hi> except it be grown into a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom: For thoſe Diets alter the Body more, and trouble it leſs. Deſpiſe no new accident in your Body, but ask opinion of it. In <hi>Sickneſs</hi> reſpect <hi>Health</hi> Principally, and in <hi>Health, Action:</hi> For thoſe that put their Bodies
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:94631:49"/>
to endure in <hi>Healths</hi> may in moſt <hi>Sickneſſes,</hi> which are not very ſharp, be cured only with Diet and tending. <hi>Celſus</hi> could never have ſpoken it as a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> had he not been a wiſe Man withal, when he giveth it for one of the great Precepts of Health and Laſting, That a Man do vary, and enterchange contraries, but with an inclination to the more benign extream. Uſe Faſting and full Eating, but rather full Eating; Watching and Sleep, but rather Sleep; Sitting and Exerciſe, but rather Exerciſe, and the like: So ſhall Nature be cheriſhed, and yet taught Maſteries. <hi>Phyſicians</hi> are ſome of them ſo pleaſing, and conformable to the humour of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, as they preſs not the true cure of the Diſeaſe; and ſome other are ſo regular, in proceeding according to Art for the Diſeaſe, as they reſpect not ſufficiently the condition of the Patient. Take one of a middle temper, or if it may not be found in one Man, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine two of either ſort; and forget not to call as well the beſt acquainted with your Body, as the beſt reputed of for his Faculty.</p>

Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are to be repreſſed, or at leaſt well guarded; for they cloud the Mind, they leeſe Friends, that they check with Buſineſs, whereby Buſineſs cannot go on currant and conſtantly. They diſpoſe Kings to Tyranny, Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands to Jealouſie, Wiſe Men to Irreſolution and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy. They are defects, not in the Heart, but in the Brain; for they take place in the ſtouteſt Natures: As in the example of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh of <hi>England,</hi> there was not a more <hi>Suſpicious</hi> Man, nor a more Stout:
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:94631:49"/>
And in ſuch a compoſition they do ſmall hurt. For commonly they are not admitted, but with examination whether they be likely or no; but in fearful Natures they gain ground too faſt. There is nothing makes a Man <hi>ſuſpect</hi> much, more than to know little; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men ſhould remedy <hi>Suſpicion,</hi> by procuring to know more, and not to keep their <hi>Suſpicions</hi> in ſmother. What would Men have? Do they think thoſe they im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy and deal with are Saints? Do they not think they will have their own ends, and be truer to themſelves than to them? Therefore there is no better way to <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate Suſpicions,</hi> than to account upon ſuch <hi>Suſpicions</hi> as true, and yet to bridle them as falſe. For ſo far a Man ought to make uſe of <hi>Suſpicions,</hi> as to provide, as if that ſhould be true that he <hi>ſuſpects,</hi> yet it may do him no hurt. <hi>Suſpicions</hi> that the mind of it ſelf gathers are but Buzzes, but <hi>Suſpicions</hi> that are artificially nouriſhed, and put into <hi>Mens heads</hi> by the <hi>tales</hi> and whiſpering of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, have Stings Certainly the beſt means to clear the way in this ſame Wood of <hi>Suſpicions,</hi> is frankly to communicate them with the Party that he <hi>ſuſpects;</hi> for thereby he ſhall be ſure to know more of the truth of them than he did before; and withal, ſhall make that Party more circumſpect, not to give further cauſe of <hi>Suſpicion.</hi> But this would not be done to Men of baſe Natures: For they, if they find themſelves once <hi>ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> will never be true.

were a praiſe to know what might be ſaid, and not what ſhould be thought. Some have certain Common Places, and Themes, wherein they are good, and want variety; which kind of Poverty is for the moſt part te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, and when it is once perceived, ridiculous.

If you diſſemble ſometimes

your knowledge of that you are thought to know, you ſhall be thought another time to know that you know not. Speech of a mans ſelf ought to be ſeldom, and well choſen. I knew one was wont to ſay in ſcorn, <hi>He muſt needs be a Wiſe Man, he ſpeaks ſo much of himſelf:</hi> And there is but one caſe, wherein a Man may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend himſelf with good Grace, and that is, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending Vertue in another; eſpecially if it be ſuch a Vertue whereunto himſelf pretendeth. Speech of touch towards others ſhould be ſparingly uſed: For <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> ought to be as a Field, without coming home to any Man. I knew two <hi>Noblemen</hi> of the weſt part of <hi>England,</hi> whereof the one was given to Scoff, but kept ever Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yal Cheer in his Houſe: The other would ask of thoſe that had been at the others Table, <hi>Tell truly, was there never a Flout or dry blow given?</hi> To which the Gueſt would anſwer, <hi>Such and ſuch a thing paſſed:</hi> The Lord would ſay, <hi>I thought he would mar a good Dinner.

                  <head>XXXIII. Of Plantations.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>PLANTATIONS</hi> are amongſt Ancient, Primitive, and Heroical Works. When the World was young, it begat more Children; but now it is old, it begets fewer: for I may juſtly account new <hi>Plantations</hi> to be the Children of former Kingdoms. I like a <hi>Plantation</hi> in a pure Soyl, that is, where People are not <hi>Diſplanted,</hi> to the end, to <hi>Plant</hi> others; for elſe it is rather an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation, than a <hi>Plantation. Planting</hi> of Countries is like <hi>Planting</hi> of Woods; for you muſt make account to loſe almoſt Twenty years Profit, and expect your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence in the end. For the principal thing that hath been the deſtruction of moſt <hi>Plantations,</hi> hath been the baſe and haſty drawing of profit in the firſt years. It is true, Speedy Profit is not to be neglected, as far as may ſtand with the good of the <hi>Plantation,</hi> but no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. It is a ſhameful and unbleſſed thing, to take the Scum of People, and wicked condemned Men, to be the People with whom you <hi>Plant:</hi> and not only ſo, but it ſpoileth the <hi>Plantation;</hi> for they will ever live like Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, and not fall to work, but be lazy, and do miſchief, and ſpend Victuals, and be quickly weary; and then certifie over to their Country to the diſcredit of the <hi>Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi> The People wherewith you Plant, ought to be Gardners, Plough-men, Labourers, Smiths, Carpenters, Joyners, Fiſhermen, Fowlers, with ſome few Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries, Surgeons, Cooks, and Bakers. In a Countrey of <hi>Plantation,</hi> firſt look about what kind of Victual the Country yields of it ſelf to Hand; as Cheſnuts, Walnuts, Pine-Apples, Olives, Dates, Plumbs, Cherries, Wild-Honey, and the like, and make uſe of them. Then conſider what Victual, or Eſculent things there are, which grow ſpeedily, and within the year; as Parſnips,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94631:51"/>
Carrots, Turnips, Onions, Raddiſh, Artichoaks of <hi>Jeruſalem, Maiz,</hi> and the like. For Wheat, Barly, and Oats, they ask too much labour: But with Peaſe and Beans you may begin, both becauſe they ask leſs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and becauſe they ſerve for Meat as well as for Bread. And of Rice likewiſe cometh a great encreaſe, and it is a kind of Meat. Above all, there ought to be brought ſtore of Bisket, Oat-meal Flour, Meal, and the like, in the beginning, till Bread may be had. For Beaſts and Birds, take chiefly ſuch as are leaſt ſubject to Diſeaſes, and multiply faſteſt; as Swine, Goats, Cocks, Hens, Turkeys, Geeſe, Houſe Doves, and the like. The Victual in <hi>Plantations</hi> ought to be expended, almoſt as in a beſieged Town; that is, with a certain Allowance; and let the main part of the Ground employed to Gardens or Corn, be to a common ſtock, and to be laid in, and ſtored up, and then delivered out in Proportion, beſides ſome Spots of ground that any particular Perſon will manure for his own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate uſe. Conſider likewiſe what Commodities the Soyl, where the <hi>Plantation</hi> is, doth naturally yield, that they may ſome way help to defray the charge of the <hi>Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> So it be not, as was ſaid, to the untimely Prejudice of the main buſineſs; as it hath fared with <hi>Tobacco</hi> in <hi>Virginia.</hi> Wood commonly aboundeth but too much, and therefore Timber is fit to be one. If there be Iron Ore, and ſtreams whereupon to ſet the Mills, Iron is a brave commodity where Wood aboundeth. Making of Bay Salt, if the Climate be proper for it, would be put in experience. Growing Silk likewiſe if any be, is a likely commodity. Pitch and Tar, where ſtore of Firs and Pines are, will not fail. So Drugs, and Sweet Woods, where they are, cannot but yield great profit. Soap Aſhes likewiſe, and other things that may be thought of. But moil not too much under Ground; for the hope of Mines is very uncertain, and uſeth to make the <hi>Planters</hi> lazy in other things. For Government, let it be in the hands of one aſſiſted with ſome Counſel;
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94631:52"/>
and let them have commiſſion to exerciſe Martial Laws with ſome limitation. And above all, Let Men make that Profit of being in the Wilderneſs, as they have God always, and his ſervice before their eyes. Let not the Government of the <hi>Plantation</hi> depend upon too many Counſellors and undertakers in the Country that <hi>Planteth,</hi> but upon a temperate number; and let thoſe be rather Noblemen and Gentlemen, than Merchants; for they look ever to the preſent Gain. Let there be Freedoms for Cuſtom, till the <hi>Plantation</hi> be of Strength; and not only Freedom from Cuſtom, but Freedom to carry their Commodities, where they may make the beſt of them, except there be ſome ſpecial cauſe of Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Cram not in People, by ſending too faſt, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany after Company, but rather hearken how they waſte, and ſend ſupplies proportionably; but ſo, as the number may live well in the <hi>Plantation,</hi> and not by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge be in penury. It hath been a great endangering to the health of ſome <hi>Plantations,</hi> that they have built a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the Sea and Rivers in mariſh and unwholeſome Grounds. Therefore, though you begin there to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void carriage, and other like diſcommodities, yet build ſtill rather upwards from the Streams, than along. It concerneth likewiſe the health of the <hi>Plantation,</hi> that they have good ſtore of Salt with them, that they may uſe it in their Victuals, when it ſhall be neceſſary. If you <hi>Plant</hi> where Savages are, do not only entertain them with trifles and gingles, but uſe them juſtly and graciouſly, with ſufficient guard nevertheleſs; and do not win their favour by helping them to invade their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, but for their defence it is not amiſs. And ſend oft of them over to the Country that <hi>Plant,</hi> that they may ſee a better condition than their own, and commend it when they return. When the <hi>Plantation</hi> grows to ſtrength, then it is time to <hi>Plant</hi> with Women as well as with Men, that the <hi>Plantation</hi> may ſpread into Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and not be ever pieced from without. It is the ſinfulleſt thing in the World to forſake or deſtitute a
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94631:52"/>
                     <hi>Plantation</hi> once in forwardneſs; for beſides the diſhonour, it is guiltineſs of Blood of many commiſerable Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>

Seek not proud <hi>Riches,</hi> but ſuch as thou mayeſt get juſtly, uſe ſoberly, diſtribute chearfully, and leave contentedly: Yet have no Abſtract nor Frierly contempt of them, but diſtinguiſh, as <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaith well of <hi>Rabirius Poſthumus; In ſtudio rei amplificandae apparebat, non Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritiae praedam, ſed inſtrumentum Bonitatis, quaeri.</hi> Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken

alſo to <hi>Solomon,</hi> and beware of haſty gathering of <hi>Riches: Qui feſtinat ad Divitias, non erit inſons.</hi> The Poets feign, that when <hi>Plutus</hi> (which is <hi>Riches)</hi> is ſent from <hi>Jupiter,</hi> he limps and goes ſlowly; but when he is ſent from <hi>Pluto,</hi> he runs, and is ſwift of foot; mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that <hi>Riches</hi> gotten by good means, and juſt labour, pace ſlowly: But when they come by the death of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, (as by the courſe of inheritance, Teſtaments, and the like) they come tumbling upon a Man. But it might be applied likewiſe to <hi>Pluto,</hi> taking him for the Devil; for when <hi>Riches</hi> come from the Devil (as by Fraud, and Oppreſſion, and unjuſt means) they come upon Speed. The <hi>Ways to inrich</hi> are many, and moſt of them foul; <hi>Parſimony</hi> is one of the beſt, and yet is not innocent; for it withholdeth Men from works of Liberality and Charity. The <hi>Improvement of the ground</hi> is the moſt natural obtaining of <hi>Riches;</hi> for it is our Great Mothers Bleſſing, the Earths, but it is ſlow; and yet where the Men of great wealth do ſtoop to Husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, it multiplieth <hi>Riches</hi> exceedingly. I knew a Noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>England,</hi> that had the greateſt Audits of any Man in my time: A great Graſier, a great Sheep-Maſter, a great Timber-Man, a great Collier, a great Corn-Maſter, a great Lead-Man, and ſo of Iron, and a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the like points of Husbandry; ſo as the Earth ſeemed a Sea to him in reſpect of the perpetual Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation. It was truly obſerved by One, that himſelf came very hardly to a little <hi>Riches,</hi> and very eaſily to great <hi>Riches;</hi> for when a Mans ſtock is come to that, that he can expect the Prime of Markets, and overcome thoſe bargains, which for their greatneſs are few Mens money, and be Partner in the induſtries of Younger Men, he cannot but encreaſe mainly. The <hi>Gains</hi> of <hi>ordinary Trades</hi> and <hi>Vocations</hi> are honeſt, and furthered by two things, chiefly, by Diligence, and by a good Name, for good and fair dealing.

As for the <hi>Chopping of Bargains,</hi> when a Man buys, not to hold, but to ſell over again, that commonly grindeth double, both upon the Seller and upon the Buyer. <hi>Sharings</hi> do greatly <hi>inrich,</hi> if the Hands be well choſen that are truſted. <hi>Uſury</hi> is the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineſt means of Gain, though one of the worſt; as that whereby a Man doth eat his Bread, <hi>In ſudore vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus alieni:</hi> And beſides, doth plow upon Sundays.

He that reſteth upon <hi>Gains Certain,</hi> ſhall hardly grow to great <hi>Riches;</hi> and he that puts all upon <hi>Adventures,</hi> doth oftentimes break, and come to Poverty: It is good therefore to guard <hi>Adventures</hi> with <hi>Certainties</hi> that may uphold loſſes. <hi>Monopolies</hi> and <hi>Coemption</hi> of Wares for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale,</hi> where they are not reſtrained, are great means to <hi>enrich,</hi> eſpecially if the Party have intelligence what things are like to come into requeſt, and to ſtore him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf before-hand. Riches gotten by <hi>Service,</hi> though it be of the beſt Riſe, yet when they are gotten by Flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, feeding Humours, and other ſervile Conditions, they may be placed amongſt the Worſt. As for fiſhing for <hi>Teſtaments</hi> and <hi>Executorſhips,</hi> (as <hi>Tacitus</hi> ſaith of <hi>Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, Teſtamenta &amp; Orbos tanquam Indagine capi)</hi> it is yet worſe, by how much men ſubmit themſelves to mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner perſons, than in <hi>Service.</hi> Believe not much them that ſeem to deſpiſe <hi>Riches;</hi> for they deſpiſe them that deſpair of them, and none worſe when they come to them.

they muſt be ſet flying to bring in more. Men leave their <hi>Riches</hi> either to their Kindred, or to the Publick; and moderate Portions proſper beſt in both. A great State left to an Heir, is as a Lure to all the Birds of prey, round about to ſeize on him, if he be not the better eſtabliſhed in Years and Judgment. Likewiſe glorious Gifts and Foundations are like <hi>Sacrifices with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Salt,</hi> and but the <hi>Painted Sepulchres of Alms,</hi> which ſoon will putrefie and corrupt inwardly: Therefore mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure not thine advancements by quantity, but frame them by meaſure; and defer not Charities till death: For certainly if a man weigh it rightly, he that doth ſo is rather liberal of another mans, than of his own.</p>

It was generally conceived to be meant of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Fleet that came in 88. For that the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Sir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name, as they ſay, is <hi>Norway.</hi> The Prediction of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giomontanus,</hi>
                     <q>Octogeſſimus octavus mirabilis Annus,</q>
Was thought likewiſe accompliſhed, in the ſending of that great Fleet, being the greateſt in ſtrength, though not in number, that ever ſwam upon the Sea. As for <hi>Cleon</hi>'s Dream, I think it was a Jeſt; It was, That he was devoured of a long Dragon; and it was expounded of a Maker of Sauſages that troubled him exceedingly. There are numbers of the like kind, eſpecially if you include <hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Predictions</hi> of <hi>Aſtrology.</hi> But I have ſet down theſe few only of certain credit for example. My judgment is, that they ought all to be deſpiſed, and

ought to ſerve but for winter-talk by the fire-ſide: Though, when I ſay <hi>Deſpiſed,</hi> I mean it as for belief; for otherwiſe, the ſpreading or publiſhing of them is in no ſort to be <hi>Deſpiſed;</hi> for they have done much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.

That that have given them grace, and ſome credit, conſiſteth in three things: Firſt, That Men mark when they hit, and never mark when they miſs; as they do generally alſo of <hi>Dreams.</hi> The ſecond is. That probable Conjectures, or obſcure Traditions, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times turn themſelves into <hi>Prophecies,</hi> while the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Man, which coveteth <hi>Divination,</hi> thinks it no peril to foretell that which indeed they do but collect: As that of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s Verſe.

                     <hi>AMBITION</hi> is like <hi>Choler,</hi> which is an Humour that maketh Men Active, Earneſt, full of Alacrity, and Stirring, if it be not ſtopped, but if it be ſtopped and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have its way, it becometh a duſt, and thereby Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign and Venomous. So <hi>Ambitious Men,</hi> if they find the way open for their Riſing, and ſtill get forward, they are rather Buſie than Dangerous; but if they be checkt in their deſires, they become ſecretly diſcontent,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:94631:56"/>
and look upon Men and Matters with an Evil Eye, and are beſt pleaſed when things go backward, which is the worſt property in a Servant of a Prince or State. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is good for Princes, if they uſe <hi>Ambitious Men,</hi> to handle it ſo, as they be ſtill Progreſſive, and not Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade; which, becauſe it cannot be without inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, it is good not to uſe ſuch Natures at all. For if they riſe not with their Service, they will take order to make their Service fall with them. But ſince we have ſaid, it were good not to uſe Men of <hi>Ambitious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> except it be upon neceſſity, it is fit we ſpeak in what caſes they are of neceſſity. Good Commanders in the Wars muſt be taken, be they never ſo <hi>Ambitious;</hi> for the uſe of their Service diſpenſeth with the reſt; and to take a Soldier without <hi>Ambition,</hi> is to pull off his Spurs. There is alſo great uſe of <hi>Ambitious Men,</hi> in being Skreens to Princes in matters of danger and Envy; for no man will take that part, except he be like a ſeeld Dove, that mounts and mounts, becauſe he cannot ſee about him. There is uſe alſo of <hi>Ambitious Men,</hi> in pulling down the greatneſs of any Subject that over-tops; as <hi>Tiberius</hi> uſed <hi>Macro</hi> in pulling down of <hi>Sejanus.</hi> Since therefore they muſt be uſed in ſuch caſes, there reſteth to ſpeak how they are to be bridled, that they may be leſs <hi>Dangerous.</hi> There is leſs <hi>Danger</hi> of them, if they be of mean Birth, than if they be Noble; and if they be rather harſh of Nature, than Gracious and Popular; and if they be rather new raiſed, than grown cunning, and fortified in their Greatneſs. It is counted by ſome a weakneſs in Princes to have <hi>Favourites;</hi> but it is of all others the beſt remedy againſt <hi>Ambitious Great Ones.</hi> For when the way of pleaſuring and diſpleaſuring lieth by the <hi>Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi> it is impoſſible any other ſhould be <hi>Over-great.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother means to curb them, is to balance them by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers as proud as they. But then there muſt be ſome middle Counſellors to keep things ſteady; for without that Ballaſt the Ship will roul too much. At the leaſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a Prince may animate and inure ſome meaner Perſons,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94631:56"/>
to be as it were Scourges to <hi>Ambitious Men.</hi> As for the having of them obnoxious to ruine, if they be of fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Natures, it may do well; but if they be ſtout and daring, it may precipitate their Deſigns, and prove dangerous. As for the pulling of them down, if the Affairs require it, and that it may not be done with fafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſuddenly, the only way is, the enterchange continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of Favours and diſgraces; whereby they may not know what to expect, and be as it were in a Wood. Of <hi>Ambitions,</hi> it is leſs harmful the <hi>Ambition</hi> to prevail in great things, than that other to appear in every thing; for that breeds confuſion, and mars buſineſs. But yet it is leſs Danger, to have an <hi>Ambitious Man</hi> ſtirring in buſineſs, than great in dependences. He that ſeeketh to be eminent amongſt able Men, hath a great task; but that is ever good for the Publick; but he that plots to be the only Figure amongſt Cyphers, is the decay of an whole Age. <hi>Honour</hi> hath three things in it: The Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage Ground to do good, the approach to Kings and Principal Perſons, and the raiſing of a Mans own For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. He that hath the beſt of theſe Intentions when he aſpireth, is an honeſt Man; and that Prince that can diſcern of theſe Intentions in another that aſpireth, is a wiſe Prince. Generally, let Princes and States chuſe ſuch Miniſters as are more ſenſible of Duty, than of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; and ſuch as love Buſineſs rather upon Conſcience, than upon Bravery; and let them diſcern a buſie Nature from a willing Mind.</p>

with Elegancy, than daubed with Coſt. <hi>Dancing to Song,</hi> is a thing of great State and Pleaſure.

It is true, the <hi>Alterations</hi> of <hi>Scenes,</hi> ſo it be qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly, and without noiſe, are things of great Beauty and Pleaſure, for they feed and relieve the Eye, before it be full of the ſame Object.

Let the <hi>Songs</hi> be <hi>Loud</hi> and <hi>Chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> and not <hi>Chirpings</hi> or <hi>Pulings.</hi> Let the <hi>Muſick</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be <hi>Sharp</hi> and <hi>Loud,</hi> and <hi>well placed.</hi> The <hi>Colours</hi> that ſhew beſt by Candle-light, are White, Carnation, and a kind of Sea-water Green; and <hi>Oes</hi> or <hi>Spangs,</hi> as they are of no great Coſt, ſo they are of moſt Glory. As for <hi>Rich Embroidery,</hi> it is loſt, and not diſcerned. Let the <hi>Suits</hi> of <hi>Maskers</hi> be graceful, and ſuch as become the Perſon when the Vizars are off, not after examples of known Attires; Turks, Soldiers, Mariners, and the like. Let <hi>Anti-masks</hi> not be long, they have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of Fools, Satyrs, Baboons, Wild-men, Antiques, Beaſts, Spirits, Witches, Ethiops, Pigmies, Turquets, Nymphs, Ruſticks, Cupids, Statua's moving, and the

like. As for <hi>Angels,</hi> it is not Comical enough to put them in <hi>Anti-masks;</hi> and any thing that is hideous, as Devils, Giants, is on the other ſide as unfit.

                  <head>XXXIX. Of Cuſtom and Education.</head>
                  <p>MENS Thoughts are much according to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, their Diſcourſe and Speeches according to their Learning and infuſed Opinions; but their Deeds are after as they have been <hi>accuſtomed:</hi> And therefore as <hi>Machiavel</hi> well noteth, (though in an ill-favoured In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) there is no truſting to the force of Nature nor to the bravery of Words, except it be corroborate by <hi>Cuſtom.</hi> His inſtance is, that for the atchieving of a deſperate Conſpiracy, a Man ſhould not reſt upon the fierceneſs of any Mans Nature, or his reſolute underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings; but take ſuch an one as hath had his hands for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in Blood. But <hi>Machiavoel</hi> knew not of a <hi>Frier Clement,</hi> not a <hi>Ravilliac,</hi> nor a <hi>Jauregy,</hi> nor a <hi>Baltazer Gerrard;</hi> yet this Rule holdeth ſtill, that Nature, nor the Engagement of Words are not ſo forcible as <hi>Cuſtoms.</hi> Only Superſtition is now ſo well advanced, that Men of the firſt blood are as firm as Butchers by Occupation, and Votary Reſolution is made Equipollent to <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> even in matter of blood. In other things the predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of <hi>Cuſtom</hi> is every where viſible, inſomuch as a man would wonder to hear men Profeſs, Proteſt, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, give great Words, and then do juſt as they have done before, as if they were dead Images, and Engines moved only by the wheels of <hi>Cuſtom.</hi> We ſee alſo the Reign or Tyranny of <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> what it is. The <hi>Indians</hi> (I mean the Sect of their Wiſe Men) lay themſelves quietly upon a ſtack of Wood, and ſo Sacrifice them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:94631:59"/>
by fire. Nay, the Wives ſtrive to be burned with the Corps of their Husbands. The Lads of <hi>Sparta</hi> of ancient time, were wont to be ſcourged upon the Altar of <hi>Diana</hi> without ſo much as Squeeking. I remember in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, of <hi>England,</hi> an <hi>Iriſh Rebel</hi> condemned, put up a Petition to the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty,</hi> that he might be hanged in a Wyth, and not in an Halter, becauſe it had been ſo uſed with former <hi>Rebels.</hi> There be <hi>Monks</hi> in <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> for Pennance, that will ſit a whole night in a Veſſel of Water, till they be engaged with hard Ice. Many examples may be put down of the Force of <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> both upon mind and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Therefore ſince <hi>Cuſtom</hi> is the Principal Magiſtrate of Man's life, let Men by all means endeavour to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain good <hi>Cuſtoms.</hi> Certainly <hi>Cuſtom</hi> is moſt perfect when it beginneth in young years: This we call <hi>Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi> which is in effect but an <hi>early Cuſtom.</hi> So we ſee in Languages, the Tongue is more pliant to all Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and Sounds, the Joynts are more ſupple to all Feats of Activity and motions in Youth than after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. For it is true, the late Learners cannot ſo well take the ply, except it be in ſome minds that have not ſuffered themſelves to fix, but have kept themſelves open and prepared to receive continual amendment, which is exceeding rare. But if the Force of <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> Simple and Separate, be great, the Force of <hi>Cuſtom</hi> Copulate, and Conjoyned, and Collegiate, is far greater. For their Example teacheth, Company comforteth, Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation quickneth, Glory raiſeth: So as in ſuch Places the Force of <hi>Cuſtom</hi> is in his Exaltation. Certainly the great multiplication of Virtues upon humane Nature, reſteth upon Societies well ordained and diſciplined: for Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealths and good Governments do nouriſh Virtue Grown, but do not much mend the Seeds. But the miſery is, that the moſt effectual Means are now apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Ends leaſt to be deſired.</p>

                  <head>XI. Of Fortune.</head>
                  <p>IT cannot be denyed, but outward accidents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce much to <hi>Fortune:</hi> Favour, Opportunity, Death of others, Occaſion fitting Virtue. But chiefly the mould of a <hi>Man's Fortune</hi> is in his own hands. <hi>Faber quiſque Fortunae ſuae,</hi> ſaith the Poet. And the moſt frequent of External Cauſes is, that the Folly of one man is the <hi>Fortune</hi> of another. For no man proſpers ſo ſuddenly, as by others errors. <hi>Serpens niſi Serpentem comederit non fit Draco.</hi> Overt and Apparent Virtues bring forth Praiſe; but there be Secret and Hidden Virtues that bring forth <hi>Fortune.</hi> Certain Deliveries of a Man's ſelf, which have no Name. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Name, <hi>Deſemboltura,</hi> partly expreſſeth them, when there be not Stands nor Reſtiveneſs in a <hi>Man's Nature,</hi> but that the Wheels of his <hi>Mind</hi> keep way with the Wheels of his <hi>Fortune.</hi> For ſo <hi>Livy</hi> (after he had deſcribed <hi>Cato Major,</hi> in theſe words, <hi>in illo viro, tantum Robur Corporis &amp; Animi fuit, ut quocunque loco natus eſſet, Fortunam ſibi facturus vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deretur)</hi> falleth upon that, that he had <hi>Verſatile Ingenium.</hi> Therefore if a man look ſharply and attentively, he ſhall ſee <hi>Fortune:</hi> For though ſhe be blind, yet ſhe is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible. The way of <hi>Fortune</hi> is like the <hi>Milkie Way</hi> in the Skie, which is a Meeting or Knot of a number of ſmall Stars; not ſeen aſunder, but giving Light together: So are there a number of little, and ſcarce diſcerned Virtues, or rather Faculties and Cuſtoms that make men <hi>Fortunate.</hi> The <hi>Italian</hi> note ſome of them, ſuch as a Man would little think: When they ſpeak of one that cannot do amiſs, they will through in into his other Conditions that he hath, <hi>Poco di Matto.</hi> And certainly, there be not two more <hi>Fortunate</hi> properties, than to have a <hi>little</hi> of the <hi>Fool,</hi> and not <hi>too much</hi> of the <hi>Honeſt.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore extream Lovers of their Country, or Maſters, were never <hi>Fortunate,</hi> neither can they be. For when a man
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94631:60"/>
placeth his thoughts without himſelf, he goeth not his own way, and haſty <hi>Fortune</hi> maketh an Enterpriſer and Remover; (the <hi>French</hi> hath it better. <hi>Enterprenant</hi> or <hi>Remuant)</hi> but the exerciſed <hi>Fortune</hi> maketh the able Man. <hi>Fortune</hi> is to be Honoured and Reſpected, if it be but for her Daughters, <hi>Confidence</hi> and <hi>Reputation:</hi> For thoſe two <hi>Felicity</hi> breedeth; the firſt, within a Man's ſelf, the latter in others towards him. All wiſe men to decline the Envy of their own Virtues, uſe to aſcribe them to Providence and <hi>Fortune;</hi> for ſo they may the better aſſure them: And beſides, it is Greatneſs in a Man to be the Care of the Higher Powers. So <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſaid to the Pilot in the Tempeſt, <hi>Caeſarem portas, &amp; For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunam ejus.</hi> So <hi>Sylla</hi> choſe the Name of <hi>Felix,</hi> and not of <hi>Magnus.</hi> And it hath been noted, that thoſe that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe openly too much to their own Wiſdom and Policy, end <hi>Unfortunate.</hi> It is written, That <hi>Timotheus</hi> the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian,</hi> after he had, in the account he gave to the State of his Government, often interlaced his Speech, <hi>And in this Fortune had no part,</hi> never proſpered in any thing he undertook afterwards. Certainly there be, whoſe <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes</hi> are like <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Verſes,</hi> that have a Slide and Eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs more than the Verſes of other Poets, as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſaith of <hi>Timoleon</hi>'s <hi>Fortune,</hi> in reſpect of that of <hi>Ageſilaus,</hi> or <hi>Epaminondas:</hi> And that this ſhould be, no doubt it is much in a Man's ſelf.</p>

I ſay this only, that <hi>Uſury</hi> is a <hi>Conceſſum propter duritiem cordis:</hi> For ſince there muſt be Borrowing and Lending, and Men are ſo hard of Heart, as they will not lend freely, <hi>Uſury muſt</hi> be permitted. Some others have made Suſpicious and Cunning Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of Banks, diſcovery of Men's Eſtates, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inventions, but few have ſpoken of <hi>Uſury</hi> uſefully. It is good to ſet before us the <hi>Incommodities</hi> and <hi>Commodities</hi> of <hi>Uſury,</hi> that the good may be either Weighed out, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> Culled out; and wearily to provide, that while we make forth to that which is better, we meet not with that which is worſe.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Diſcommodities</hi> of <hi>Uſury</hi> are, Firſt, That it makes fewer Merchants: for were it not for this lazy Trade of <hi>Uſury,</hi> Money would not lie ſtill, but would in great part be employed upon Merchandiſing, which is the <hi>Vena Porta</hi> of Wealth in a State. The ſecond, That it makes poor Merchants; for as a Farmer cannot husband his Ground ſo well, if he ſit at a great Rent: So the Merchant cannot drive his Trade ſo well, if he ſit at great <hi>Uſury.</hi> The third is incident to the other two; and that is, The decay of Cuſtoms, of Kings, or States, which Ebb or Flow with Merchandizing. The fourth, That it bringeth the Treaſure of a Realm or State into a few hands; for the <hi>Uſurer</hi> being at Certainties, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers at Uncertainties, at the end of the Game moſt of the Money will be in the Box; and ever a State flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth, when Wealth is more equally ſpread. The fifth, That it beats down the price of Land; for the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Money is chiefly either Merchandizing or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſing
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94631:61"/>
and <hi>Uſury</hi> way-lays both. The Sixth, That it doth dull and damp all Induſtries, Improvements, and new Inventions, wherein Money would be ſtirring, if it were not for this Slug. The laſt, That it is the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker and Ruine of many Men's Eſtates, which in proceſs of time breeds a publick Poverty.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, the <hi>Commodities</hi> of <hi>Uſury</hi> are: Firſt, That howſoever <hi>Uſury</hi> in ſome reſpect hindreth Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing, yet in ſome other it advanceth it; for it is certain, that the greateſt part of Trade is driven by young Merchants, upon borrowing at Intereſt: So as if the <hi>Uſurer</hi> either call in, or keep back his Money, there will enſue preſently a great ſtand of Trade. The ſecond is, That were it not for this eaſie borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon <hi>Intereſt,</hi> Mens neceſſities would draw upon them a moſt ſudden undoing, in that they would be forced to ſell their Means (be it Lands or Goods) far under foot; and ſo whereas <hi>Uſury</hi> doth but gnaw upon them, bad Markets would ſwallow them quite up. As for Mortaging or Pawning, it will little mend the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; for either men will not take Pawns without <hi>Uſe,</hi> or if they do, they will look preciſely for the forfeiture. I remember a cruel Monied Man in the Country, that would ſay, The Devil take this <hi>Uſury,</hi> it keeps us from Forfeitures of Mortgages and Bonds. The third and laſt is, That it is a vanity to conceive, that there would be ordinary borrowing without profit; and it is impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to conceive, the number of inconveniences that will enſue, if borrowing be cramped: Therefore to ſpeak of the aboliſhing of <hi>Uſury</hi> is idle. All States have ever had it in one kind, or rate or other: ſo as that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion muſt be ſent to <hi>Utopia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſpeak now of the <hi>Reformation</hi> and <hi>Reiglement</hi> of <hi>U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury</hi> how the <hi>Diſcommodities</hi> of it may be beſt avoided, and the <hi>Commodities</hi> retained. It appears by the Ballance of <hi>Commodities</hi> and <hi>Diſcommodities</hi> of <hi>Uſury,</hi> two things are to be reconciled: The one, that the <hi>Tooth</hi> of <hi>Uſury</hi> be grinded, that it bite not too much: The other, that
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:94631:61"/>
there be left open a means to invite Monied Men to lend to the Merchants, for the Continuing and Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Trade. This cannot be done, except you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce two ſeveral ſorts of <hi>Uſury,</hi> a <hi>leſs</hi> and a <hi>greater.</hi> For if you reduce <hi>Uſury</hi> to one low rate, it will eaſe the <hi>Common Borrower,</hi> but the <hi>Merchant</hi> will be to ſeek for Money. And it is to be noted, that the Trade of Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>dize, being the moſt <hi>Lucrative,</hi> may bear <hi>Uſury</hi> at a good rate; other Contracts not ſo.</p>
                  <p>To ſerve both Intentions the way would be chiefly thus: That there be <hi>two Rates of Uſury,</hi> the one Free and General for all, the other under <hi>Licence</hi> only to <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Perſons,</hi> and in <hi>certain Places of Merchandizing.</hi> Firſt therefore, let <hi>Uſury in general be reduced to Five in the Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> and let that Rate be proclaimed to be Free and Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; and let the Sate ſhut it ſelf out to take any penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the ſame. This will preſerve Borrowing from any general Stop or Dryneſs. This will eaſe infinite Borrowers in the Country. This will in good part raiſe the price of Land, becauſe Land purchaſed at Sixteen years purchaſe, will yield Six in the Hundred, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what more, whereas this Rate of Intereſt yields but Five. This by reaſon will encourage and edge Induſtrious and Profitable Improvements, becauſe many will rather venture in that kind, than take Five in the Hundred, eſpecially having been uſed to greater profit. Secondly, Let there be <hi>certain Perſons Licenſed to lend to known Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,</hi> upon <hi>Uſury,</hi> at a <hi>High-Rate;</hi> and let it be with the Cautions following. Let the Rate be, even with the Merchant himſelf, ſomewhat more eaſie than that he uſed formerly to pay: for by that means all Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowers ſhall have ſome eaſe by this Reformation, be he Merchant or whoſoever. Let it be no Bank or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Stock, but every man be Maſter of his own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Not that I altogether miſlike Banks, but they will hardly be brooked, in regard of certain ſuſpicions. Let the State be anſwered ſome ſmall matter for the Licenſe, and the reſt left to the Lender; for if the abatement be
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94631:62"/>
but ſmall, it will no whit diſcourage the Lender. For he, for example, that took before Ten or Nine in the Hundred, will ſooner deſcend to Eight in the Hundred, than give over his Trade of <hi>Uſury,</hi> and go from Certain Gains to Gains of Hazard. Let theſe Licenſed Lenders be in number indefinite, but reſtrained to certain prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cities and Towns of Merchandizing, for then they will be hardly able to colour other mens moneys in the Country, ſo as the <hi>Licence of Nine</hi> will not ſuck away the current <hi>Rate of Five;</hi> for no man will Lend his Moneys far off, nor put them into unknown hands.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected, That this doth in a ſort Authorize <hi>Uſury,</hi> which before was in ſome places but permiſſive: The Anſwer is, that it is better to mitigate <hi>Uſury</hi> by <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration,</hi> than to ſuffer it to rage by <hi>Connivence.</hi>

                  <p>A Man that is <hi>Young</hi> in <hi>Years,</hi> may be Old in Hours, if he have loſt no time, but that happeneth rarely. Generally <hi>Youth</hi> is like the firſt Cogitations, not ſo wiſe as the ſecond; for there is a <hi>Youth</hi> in Thoughts as well as in Ages: And yet the Invention of <hi>Young Men</hi> is more lively than that of Old, and Imaginations ſtream into their minds better, and, as it were, more Divine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Natures that have much heat, and great and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deſires and perturbations, are not ripe for Action till they have paſſed the Meridian of their years; as it was with <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> and <hi>Septimius Severus,</hi> of the latter of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Juventutem egit Erroribus, imo Furoribus plenam;</hi> and yet he was the ableſt Emperor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of all the Liſt. But repoſed Natures may do well in <hi>Youth,</hi> as it is ſeen in <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar, Coſmus</hi> Duke of <hi>Florence, Gaſton de Fois,</hi> and others. On the other ſide, Heat and Vivacity in <hi>Age,</hi> is an excellent Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:94631:62"/>
for buſineſs. <hi>Young Men</hi> are fitter to invent than to judge, fitter for Execution than for Counſel, and fitter for new projects than for ſettled buſineſs, for the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of <hi>Age</hi> in things that fall within the compaſs of it directeth them, but in new things abuſeth them. The Errors of <hi>Young Men</hi> are the ruin of Buſineſs; but the Errors of <hi>Aged Men</hi> amount but to this, that more might have been done or ſooner. <hi>Young Men</hi> in the conduct and manage of Actions embrace more than they can hold, ſtir more than they can quiet fly to the end with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſideration of the means and degrees, purſue ſome few Principles which they have chanced upon abſurdly, care not to innovate, which draws unknown Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies: Uſe extream Remedies at firſt, and that which doubleth all Errors, will not acknowledge or retract them, like an unready Horſe, that will neither Stop nor Turn. <hi>Men</hi> of <hi>Age</hi> object too much, conſult too long, adventure too little, repent too ſoon, and ſeldom drive buſineſs home to the full period, but content themſelves with a mediocrity of Succeſs. Certainly it is good to compound <hi>Employments</hi> of both; for that will be good for the <hi>preſent,</hi> becauſe the vertues of either <hi>Age</hi> may cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the defects of both, and good for Succeſſion, that <hi>Young Men</hi> may be Learners, while <hi>Men</hi> in <hi>Age</hi> are Actors. And laſtly, good for <hi>Extern Accidents,</hi> becauſe Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity followeth <hi>Old Men,</hi> and Favour and Popularity <hi>Youth.</hi> But for the moral part, perhaps <hi>Youth</hi> will have the preheminence, as <hi>Age</hi> hath for the politick. A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Rabbins</hi> upon the Text, <hi>Your young Men ſhall ſee viſions, and your old Men ſhall dream dreams,</hi> inferreth, that <hi>Young Men</hi> are admitted nearer to God than <hi>Old,</hi> becauſe <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> is a clearer Revelation than a <hi>Dream.</hi> And certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the more a Man drinketh of the World, the more it intoxicateth; and <hi>Age</hi> doth profit rather in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Underſtanding, than in the Vertues of the Will and Affections.

                  <head>XLIII. Of Beauty.</head>
                  <p>VERTUE is like a rich Stone, beſt plain ſet; and ſurely, Vertue is beſt in a Body that is comely, though not of delicate Features, and that hath rather Dignity of Preſence, than <hi>Beauty</hi> of Aſpect. Neither is it almoſt ſeen that very <hi>Beautiful Perſons</hi> are otherwiſe of great Vertue, as if Nature were rather buſie not to err, than in labour to produce Excellency; and therefore they prove accompliſhed, but not out of great Spirit, and ſtudy rather Behaviour than Vertue. But this holds not always, for <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar, Titus Veſpaſianus, Philip de Belle</hi> of <hi>France, Edward</hi> the fourth of <hi>England, Alcibiades</hi> of <hi>Athens, Iſmael</hi> the <hi>Sophy</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> were all high and great Spirits, and yet the moſt <hi>Beautiful Men</hi> of their times. In <hi>Beauty,</hi> that of <hi>Favour</hi> is more than that of <hi>Colour;</hi> and that of <hi>decent</hi> and <hi>gracious Motion,</hi> more than that of <hi>Favour.</hi> That is the beſt part of <hi>Beauty</hi> which a Picture cannot expreſs, no nor the firſt ſight of the Life. There is no excellent <hi>Beauty</hi> that hath not ſome ſtrangeneſs in the proportion. A Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell, whether <hi>Apelles</hi> or <hi>Albert Durer</hi> were the more trifler; whereof the one would make a Perſonage by
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94631:63"/>
Geometrical Proportions, the other by taking the beſt Parts out of divers Faces to make one excellent. Such Perſonages I think would pleaſe no body, but the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that made them. Not but I think a Painter may make a better Face than ever was, but he muſt do it by a kind of <hi>Felicity,</hi> (as a Muſician that maketh an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Air in Muſick) and not by Rule. A Man ſhall ſee Faces, that if you examine them part by part, you ſhall find never a good, and yet altogether do well.

                  <p>
                     <hi>DEFORMED Perſons</hi> are commonly even with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for as Nature hath done ill by them, ſo do they by Nature, being for the moſt part (as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith) <hi>void of Natural Affection,</hi> and ſo they have Revenge of Nature. Certainly, there is a conſent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the body and the mind, and where Nature err<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in the one, ſhe ventureth in the other; <hi>Ubi peccat in uno, periclitatur in altero.</hi> But becauſe there is in Man an Election touching the Frame of his mind, and a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in the Frame of his body, the Stars of natural Inclination are ſometimes obſcured by the Sun of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline and Vertue: Therefore it is good to conſider of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94631:64"/>
                     <hi>Deformity,</hi> not as a Sign which is more deceivable, but as a Cauſe which ſeldom faileth of the Effect. Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath any thing fixed in his Perſon that doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Contempt, hath alſo a perpetual Spur in himſelf to reſcue and deliver himſelf from Scorn. Therefore all <hi>Deformed Perſons</hi> are extream bold. Firſt, as in their own Defence, as being expoſed to Scorn, but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time, by a general Habit. Alſo it ſtirreth in them induſtry, and eſpecially of this kind, to watch and obſerve the weakneſs of others, that they may have ſomewhat to repay. Again, in their Superiors, it quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Jealouſie towards them, as Perſons that they think they may at pleaſure deſpiſe; and it layeth their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors and Emulators aſleep, as never believing they ſhould be in poſſibility of Advancement, till they ſee them in Poſſeſſion; ſo that upon the matter in a great Wit, <hi>Deformity</hi> is an advantage to Riſing. Kings in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times (and at this preſent in ſome Countries) were wont to put great Truſt in <hi>Eunuchs;</hi> becauſe they that are envious to all, are more obnoxious and officious to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards one. But yet their Truſt towards them hath ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther been as to good Spials, and good whiſperers, than good Magiſtrates and Officers. And much like is the Reaſon of <hi>Deformed Perſons.</hi> Still the ground is, they will if they be of Spirit, ſeek to free themſelves from Scorn, which muſt be either by Vertue or Malice; and therefore let it not be marvelled if ſometimes they prove excellent Perſons; as was <hi>Ageſilaus, Zanger</hi> the Son of <hi>Solyman, Aeſop, Gaſca</hi> Preſident of <hi>Peru,</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> may go likewiſe amongſt them, with others.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>HOUSES</hi> are built to live in, and not to look on: Therefore let Uſe be preferred before Uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, except where both may be had. Leave the goodly Fabricks of <hi>Houſes,</hi> for Beauty only, to the <hi>Enchanted Palaces</hi> of the <hi>Poets,</hi> who build them with ſmall coſt. He that builds a fair <hi>Houſe</hi> upon an <hi>ill Seat,</hi> committeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to Priſon. Neither do I reckon it an <hi>ill Seat</hi> only wherethe Air is unwholeſome, but likewiſe where the Air is unequal; as you ſhall ſee many fine <hi>Seats</hi> ſet upon a knap of Ground, environed with higher Hills round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, whereby the Heat of the Sun is pent in, and the Wind gathereth as in Troughs; ſo as you ſhall have, and that ſuddenly, as great Diverſity of Heat and Cold, as if you dwelt in ſeveral Places. Neither is it <hi>ill Air</hi> only that maketh an <hi>ill Seat,</hi> but ill ways, ill Markets; and if you will conſult with <hi>Momus,</hi> ill Neighbours. I ſpeak not of any more: Want of Water, want of Wood, Shade and Shelter, want of Fruitfulneſs, and mixture of Grounds of ſeveral Natures, want of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, want of level Grounds, wnat of Places at ſome near Diſtance for Sports of Hunting, Hawking, and Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; Too near the Sea too remote, having the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity of Navigable Rivers, or the Diſcommodity of their Overflowing: Too far off from great Cities, which may hinder Buſineſs, or too near them which lurcheth all Proviſions, and maketh every thing dear: Where a Man hath a great Living laid together, and where he is ſcanted. All which, as it is impoſſible perhaps to find together, ſo it is good to know them, and think of them, that a Man may take as many as he can; And if have ſeveral Dwellings, that he ſort them ſo, that what he wanteth in the one, he may find in the other. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cullus</hi>

                  <p>Firſt therefore, I ſay, you cannot have a perfect <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace,</hi> except you have two ſeveral Sides; a Side for the <hi>Banquet,</hi> as is ſpoken of in the Book of <hi>Heſter,</hi> and a Side for the <hi>Houſhold;</hi> the one for Feaſts and Triumphs, and the other for Dwelling. I underſtand both theſe Sides to be not only Returns, but Parts of the <hi>Front,</hi> and to be uniform without, though ſeverally Partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned within, and to be on both ſides of a great and <hi>Stately Tower</hi> in the midſt of the <hi>Front,</hi> that as it were joyneth them together on either hand.

railed with <hi>Statua's</hi> interpoſed, and the ſame <hi>Tower</hi> to be divided into Rooms as ſhall be thought fit; the Stairs likewiſe to the upper Rooms, let them be upon a fair open <hi>Newel,</hi> and finely railed in with <hi>Images</hi> of <hi>Wood,</hi> caſt into a Braſs colour, and a very fair Landing <hi>Place</hi> at the Top. But this to be, if you do not point any of the lower Rooms for a Dining Place of Servants, for otherwiſe you ſhall have the Servants Dinner after your own; for the ſteam of it will come up as in a Tunnel.

The <hi>Row</hi> of <hi>Return</hi> on the <hi>Banquet Side,</hi> let it be all <hi>Stately Galleries,</hi> in which <hi>Galleries</hi> let there be three or five fine <hi>Cupola's</hi> in the length of it, placed at e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual diſtance, and fine <hi>Coloured Windows</hi> of ſeveral Works.

                  <p>Beyond this <hi>Court</hi> let there be an <hi>Inward Court</hi> of the ſame Square and Heighth, which is to be environed with the <hi>Garden</hi> on all ſides; and in the inſide Cloi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered upon all ſides; upon decent and beautiful Arches, as high as the firſt Story. On the <hi>Under Story</hi> towards the <hi>Garden,</hi> let it be turned to a <hi>Grotta,</hi> or place of Shade or Eſtivation; and only have opening and <hi>Windows</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Garden,</hi> and be level upon Floor, no whit ſunk under Ground, to avoid all dampiſhneſs: And let there be a <hi>Fountain,</hi> or ſome fair <hi>Work of Statua's</hi> in the midſt of this <hi>Court,</hi> and to be Paved as the other <hi>Court</hi> was. Theſe <hi>Buildings</hi> to be for <hi>Privy Lodgings</hi> on both Sides, and the end for <hi>Privy Galleries:</hi> whereof you muſt fore-ſee that one of them be for an <hi>Infirmary,</hi> if the Prince or any ſpecial perſon ſhould be Sick, with <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Bed-Chambers, Anticamera,</hi> and <hi>Recamera,</hi> joyning to it: This upon the ſecond Story.

                     <hi>GOD Almighty</hi> firſt Planted a <hi>Garden;</hi> and indeed it is the pureſt of Humane pleaſures. It is the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt refreſhment to the Spirits of Man; without which, <hi>Buildings</hi> and <hi>Palaces</hi> are but groſs Handy-works.

I do hold it in the Royal Ordering of <hi>Gardens,</hi> there ought to be <hi>Gardens</hi> for all the Months in the Year, in which, ſeverally, things of Beauty may be then in ſeaſon. For <hi>December</hi> and <hi>January<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and the latter part of <hi>November,</hi> you muſt take ſuch things as are green all Winter; Holly, Ivy, Bays, Juniper, Cypreſs Trees, Yews, Pine-Apple Trees, Fir Trees, Roſemary, Laven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Perriwinckle the White, the Purple, and the Blew, Germander, Flags, Orange-Trees, Limon-Trees, and Myrtle, if they be ſtoved, and ſweet Marjoram warm ſets. There followeth for the latter part of <hi>January</hi> and <hi>February,</hi> the Mezerion Tree, which then bloſſoms, Crocus Vernus, both the Yellow and the Grey prim-Roſes, Anemones, the Early Tulippa, Hyacinthus Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entalis, Chamairis, Frettellaria. For <hi>March</hi> there comes Violets, ſpecially the Single Blew, which are Earlieſt, the Yellow Daffadil, the Daizy, the Almond-Tree in Bloſſom, the Peach-Tree in Bloſſom, the Cornelian-Tree in Bloſſom, ſweet Briar. In <hi>April</hi> follow the double White Violet, the Wall-Flower, the Stock Gilly-Flower,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:94631:67"/>
the Cowſlip, Flower-de-Lices, and Lilies of all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Roſemary-Flower, the Tulippa, the Double Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the Pale Daffadill, the French Honey-Suckle, the Cherry-Tree in Bloſſom, the Damaſcen and Plumb-Trees in Bloſſom, the White Thorn in Leaf, the Lelack-Tree. In <hi>May</hi> and <hi>June</hi> come Pinks of all Sorts, ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Bluſh-Pink, Roſes of all kinds, except the Musk, which comes later, Hony Suckles, Strawberries, Bugloſs, Columbine, the French Marygold, Flos Africanus, Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Tree in Fruit, Ribes, Figs in Fruit, Raſps, Vine-Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, Lavender in Flowers, the Sweet Satyrian with the White Flower, Herba Muſcaria, Lilium Convallium, the Apple-Tree in Boſſom. In <hi>July</hi> come Gilly-flowers of all Varieties, Musk-Roſes, and the Lime-Tree in Bloſſom. Early Pears and Plumbs in Fruit, Gennitings, Quod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. In <hi>Auguſt</hi> come Plumbs of all ſorts in Fruit, Pears, Apricocks, Barberries, Filbeards, Musk-Melons, Monks-hoods of all Colours. In <hi>September</hi> comes, Grapes, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Poppies of all Colours, Peaches, Melo-Cotones, Nectarines, Cornelians, Wardens, Quinces. In <hi>October</hi> and the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> come Serviſes, Medlars, Bulliſes; Roſes Cut or Removed to come late, Holly-oaks, and ſuch like. Theſe particulars are for the <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> of <hi>London:</hi> But my meaning is perceived, that you may have <hi>Ver Perpetuum,</hi> as the place affords.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe the <hi>Breath</hi> of Flowers is far Sweeter in the Air, (where it comes and goes, like the Warbling of Muſick) than in the Hand, therefore nothing is more fit for that Delight, than to know what be the <hi>Flowers</hi> and <hi>Plants</hi> that do beſt perfume the Air. Roſes Damask and Red are Flowers tenacious of their Smells, ſo that you may walk by a whole Row of them, and find no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of their Sweetneſs; yea, though it be in a Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dew. Bays likewiſe yield no Smell as they grow, Roſemary little, nor Sweet-Marjoram. That which above all others yields the <hi>Sweeteſt Smell</hi> in the <hi>Air,</hi> is the Violet, ſpecially the White double Violet, which comes twice a year, about the middle of <hi>April,</hi> and
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:94631:67"/>
about <hi>Bartholomew-tide.</hi> Next to that is the Musk Roſe, then the Strawberry Leaves dying with a moſt excellent Cordial Smell. Then the Flower of the Vines, it is a little Duſt, like the Duſt of a Bent, which grows upon the Cluſter in the firſt coming forth. Then Sweet-Briar, then Wall-Flowers, which are very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful to be ſet under a Parlour, or lower Chamber Window. Then Pinks and Gilly-Flowers. eſpecially the matted Pink, and Clove Gilly-Flower. Then the Flowers of the Lime-Tree. Then the Hony-Suckles, ſo they be ſomewhatafar off. Of Bean-Flowers I ſpeak not, becauſe they are Field-Flowers. But thoſe which <hi>perfume</hi> the <hi>Air</hi> moſt delightfully, not <hi>paſſed</hi> by as the reſt, but being <hi>Trodden upon</hi> and <hi>Cruſhed,</hi> are three, that is, Burnet, Wild-Time, and Water-Mints. Therefore you are to ſet whole Alleys of them, to have the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure when you walk or tread.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Gardens,</hi> (ſpeaking of thoſe which are indeed <hi>Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi> as we have done of <hi>Buildings)</hi> The Contents ought not well to be under <hi>Thirty Acres of Ground,</hi> and to be devided into three parts; a <hi>Green</hi> in the entrance, a <hi>Heath</hi> or <hi>Deſart</hi> in the going forth, and the <hi>Main Garden</hi> in the midſt, beſides <hi>Alleys</hi> on both ſides. And I like well, that four Acres of Ground be Aſſigned to the <hi>Green,</hi> ſix to the Heath, four and four to either <hi>Side,</hi> and twelve to the <hi>Main Garden.</hi> The <hi>Green</hi> hath two pleaſures; the one, becauſe nothing is more pleaſant to the Eye than Green Graſs kept finely ſhorn; the other, becauſe it will give you a fair Alley in the midſt, by which you may go in front upon a <hi>Stately Hedge,</hi> which is to encloſe the <hi>Garden.</hi> But becauſe the Alley will be long, and in great Heat of the Year or Day, you ought not to buy the ſhade in the <hi>Garden,</hi> by going in the Sun through the <hi>Green;</hi> therefore you are of either <hi>Side</hi> the <hi>Green</hi> to plant a <hi>Covert Alley</hi> upon Carpenters Work, about twelve foot in Heighth, by which you may go in ſhade into the <hi>Garden.</hi> As for the making of <hi>Knots</hi> of <hi>Figures,</hi> with <hi>Divers Coloured Earths,</hi> that they may lie under the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows

                  <p>MANY ill matters and projects are undertaken, and private <hi>Suits</hi> do putrefie the publick Good. Many good matters are undertaken with bad minds, I mean, not only corrupt minds, but crafty minds that intend not Performance. Some embrace <hi>Suits</hi> which never mean to deal effectually in them; but if they ſee there may be life in the matter by ſome other mean, they will be content to win a Thank, or take a ſecond Reward, or at leaſt to make uſe in the mean time of the <hi>Suitor's</hi> hopes. Some take hold of <hi>Suits</hi> only for an occaſion to croſs ſome other; or to make an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, whereof they could not otherwiſe have apt Pretext, without care what become of the <hi>Suit</hi> when that turn is ſerv'd; or generally, to make other Mens buſineſs a kind of Entertainment to bring in their own. Nay, ſome undertake <hi>Suits</hi> with a full purpoſe to let them fall, to the end, to gratifie the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Party or Competitor. Surely there is in ſome ſort a Right in every <hi>Suit;</hi> either a Right of Equity, if it be a <hi>Suit</hi> of Controverſie; or a Right of Deſert, if it be a <hi>Suit</hi> of Petition. If Affections lead a Man to favour the wrong ſide in Juſtice, let him rather uſe his Countenance to compound the matter, than to carry it. If Affection lead a Man to favour the leſs worthy in Deſert, let him do it without depraving or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abling the better Deſerver. In <hi>Suits</hi> which a Man doth not well underſtand, it is good to refer them to ſome Friend of Truſt and Judgment, that may report, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he may deal in them with Honour; but let him chuſe well his Referendaries, for elſe he may be led by the Noſe. <hi>Suitors</hi> are ſo diſtaſted with Delays and Abuſes, that plain dealing in denying to deal in
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:94631:72"/>
                     <hi>Suits</hi> at firſt, and reporting the ſucceſs barely, and in challenging no more thanks than one hath deſerved, is grown not only Honourable, but alſo Gracious. In <hi>Suits</hi> of Favour, the firſt coming ought to take little place; ſo far forth Conſideration may be had of his Truſt, that if intelligence of the matter could not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe have been had, but by him, advantage be not taken of the Note, but the Party left to his other means, and in ſome ſort recompenced for his Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. To be ignorant of the value of a <hi>Suit</hi> is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity; as well as to be ignorant of the Right thereof is want of Conſcience. Secrecy in <hi>Suits</hi> is a great mean of obtaining; for voicing them to be in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, may diſcourage ſome kind of <hi>Suitors;</hi> but doth quicken and awaken others; but Timing of the <hi>Suit</hi> is the principal. Timing, I ſay, not only in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the Perſon that ſhould grant it, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of thoſe which are like to croſs it. Let a Man in the choice of his mean, rather chuſe the fitteſt mean, than the greateſt mean; and rather them that deal in certain Things, than thoſe that are General. The Reparation of a Denial, is ſometimes equal to the firſt Grant; if a Man ſhew himſelf, neither dejected, nor diſcontented: <hi>Iniquum petas, ut Aequum feras;</hi> is a good rule, where a Man hath ſtrength of Favour: But otherwiſe a Man were better riſe in his <hi>Suit;</hi> for he that would have ventured at firſt to have loſt the <hi>Suitor,</hi> will not in the Concluſion loſe both the <hi>Suitor,</hi> and his own former favour. Nothing is thought ſo eaſie a requeſt to a great Perſon as his Letter; and yet, if it be not in a good Cauſe, it is ſo much out of his Reputation. There are no worſe Inſtruments than theſe general Contrivers of <hi>Suits,</hi> for they are but a kind of poyſon and infection to publick proceedings.</p>

                  <p>STUDIES ſerve for Delight, for Ornament, and for Ability. Their chief uſe for Delight is in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vateneſs and Retiring; for Ornament is in Diſcourſe; and for Ability, is in the Judgment and Diſpoſition of Buſineſs. For expert Men can execute, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps judge of particulars one by one; but the general Counſels and the Plots, and Marſhalling of Affairs, come beſt from thoſe that are <hi>Learned.</hi> To ſpend too much time in <hi>Studies</hi> is ſloth; to uſe them too much for Ornament is affectation; to make Judgment whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by their Rules is the humour of a Scholar. They perfect Nature, and are perfected by experience: for Natural Abilities are like Natural Plants, that need Proyning by <hi>Study,</hi> and <hi>Studies</hi> themſelves do give forth Directions too much at large, except they be bounded in by experience. Crafty Men contemn <hi>Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> Simple Men admire them, and Wiſe Men uſe them: For they teach not their own uſe, but that is a Wiſdom without them, and above them, won by Obſervation. Read not to Contradict and Confute, nor to believe and take for granted, nor to find Talk and Diſcourſe, but to weigh and conſider. Some <hi>Books</hi> are to be taſted, others to be ſwallowed, and ſome few to be chewed and digeſted; that is, ſome <hi>Books</hi> are to be read only in parts; others to be read, but not curiouſly; and ſome few to be read, wholly, and with diligence and attention. Some <hi>Books</hi> alſo may be read by Deputy, and Extracts made of them by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: But that would be only in the leſs important Arguments, and the meaner ſort of <hi>Books,</hi> elſe diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Books</hi> are like common diſtilled Waters, flaſhy things. Reading maketh a full Man; Conference a
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:94631:73"/>
ready Man; and Writing an exact Man. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if a Man Write little, he had need have a great memory; if he Confer little, he had need have a preſent Wit; and if he Read little, he had need have much cunning to ſeem to know that he doth not. <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories</hi> make Men Wiſe, <hi>Poets</hi> Witty, the <hi>Mathematicks</hi> Subtil, <hi>Natural Philoſophy</hi> Deep, <hi>Moral</hi> Grave, <hi>Logick</hi> and <hi>Rhetorick</hi> able to Contend. <hi>Abiunt Studia in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res;</hi> Nay, there is no Stand or Impediment in the Wit, but may be wrought out by fit <hi>Studies:</hi> Like as Diſeaſes of the Body may have appropriate Exerciſes. Bowling is good for the Stone and Reins, Shooting for the Lungs and Breaſt, Gentle Walking for the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, Riding for the Head, and the like.

But I ſay not, that the conſideration of <hi>Factions</hi> is to be neglected. Mean Men in their riſing muſt adhere, but great Men that have ſtrength in themſelves, were better to maintain themſelves indifferent and Neutral: Yet even in beginners to adhere ſo moderately, as he be a Man of the one <hi>Faction,</hi> which is moſt paſſable with the other, commonly giveth beſt way. The lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and weaker <hi>Faction</hi> is the firmer in Conjunction: and it is often ſeen, that a few that are ſtiff, do tire out a great number that are more moderate. When one of the <hi>Factions</hi> is extinguiſhed, the remaining ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divideth: As the <hi>Faction</hi> between <hi>Lucullus,</hi> and the reſt of the Nobles of the Senate (which they called <hi>Optimates)</hi> held out a while againſt the <hi>Faction</hi> of <hi>Pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pey</hi> and <hi>Caeſar;</hi> but when the Senates Authority was pulled down, <hi>Caeſar</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> ſoon after brake.

For many a Man's ſtrength is in oppoſition, and when that faileth, he groweth out of uſe. It is commonly ſeen, that Men once placed, take in with the contrary <hi>Faction</hi> to that, by which they enter, thinking belike that they have their firſt ſure, and now are ready for a new Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe.

                  <p>HE that is only real, had need have exceeding great parts of Virtue, as the Stone had need to be rich, that is ſet without foil. But if a Man mark it well, it is in praiſe and commendation of Men, as it is in gettings and gains: For the Proverb is true, <hi>That light gains make heavy purſes;</hi> for light gains come thick, whereas great come but now and then. So it is true, that ſmall matters win great commendation, becauſe they are continually in uſe, and in note; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the occaſion of any great Virtue cometh but on Feſtivals. Therefore it doth much add to a Man's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and is, (as Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> ſaid) <hi>Like perpetual Letters Commendatory,</hi> to have good <hi>forms.</hi> To attain them, it almoſt ſufficeth not to deſpiſe them; for ſo ſhall a Man obſerve them in others: And let him truſt

himſelf with the reſt. For if he labour too much to expreſs them, he ſhall loſe their Grace, which is to be Natural and Unaffected. Some Mens behaviour is like a Verſe, wherein every Syllable is meaſured. How can a Man comprehend great matters, that breaketh his mind too much to ſmall obſervations? Not to uſe <hi>Ceremonies</hi> at all, is to teach others not to uſe them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain; and ſo diminiſh <hi>reſpect</hi> to himſelf; eſpecially, they are not to be omitted to ſtrangers, and formal Natures: But the dwelling upon them, and exalting them above the Moon, is not only tedious, but doth diminiſh the faith and credit of him that ſpeaks. And certainly, there is a kind of conveying of effectual and imprinting Paſſions amongſt Complements, which is of ſingular uſe, if a Man can hit upon it. Amongſt a Man's Peers, a Man ſhall be ſure of familiarity; and therefore it is good a little to keep State. Amongſt a Man's Inferiors, one ſhall be ſure of Reverence; and therefore it is good a little to be familiar. He that is too much in any thing, ſo that he giveth ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther occaſion of Society, maketh himſelf cheap. To apply ones ſelf to others is good, ſo it be with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration, that a Man doth it upon regard, and not facility. It is a good Precept generally in ſeconding another, yet to add ſomewhat of ones own; as if you would grant his opinion, let it be with ſome diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; if you will follow his Motion, let it be with Condition; if you allow his Counſel, let it be with alledging further Reaſon. Men had need beware, how they be too perfect in Complements: For be they never ſo ſufficient otherwiſe, their enviers will be ſure to give them that Attribute, to the diſadvantage of their greater Vertues. It is loſs alſo in buſineſs, to be too full of <hi>reſpects,</hi> or to be too curious in obſerving Times and Opportunities. <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereth the Wind ſhall not Sow, and he that looketh to the Clouds ſhall not Reap.</hi> A wiſe Man will make more op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities than he finds.

Where there is an Opinion and Fame to be created, either of Virtue or Greatneſs, theſe Men are good Trumpeters. Again, as <hi>Titus Livius</hi> noteth in the caſe of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and the <hi>Aetolians, There are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times great effects of croſs Lyes:</hi> As if a Man that Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiates between two Princes, to draw them to joyn in a War againſt the third, doth extol the Forces of either of them above meaſure, the one to the other: And ſometimes he that deals between Man and Man, raiſeth his own credit with both, by pretending great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Intereſt than he hath in either. And in theſe and the like kinds, it often falls out, that <hi>ſomewhat</hi> is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced of <hi>nothing:</hi> For Lyes are ſufficient to breed O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, and Opinion brings on Subſtance. In Milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Commanders and Soldiers, <hi>Vain Glory</hi> is an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Point: For as Iron ſharpens Iron, ſo by <hi>Glory</hi> one Courage ſharpneth another.

of the Ballaſt than of the Sail. In Fame of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Flight will ſlow, without ſome Feathers of <hi>Oſtentation. Qui de contemnendâ Gloriâ Libros ſcribunt, Nomen ſuum inſcribunt. Socrates, Ariſtotle, Galen,</hi> were Men full of <hi>Oſtentation.</hi> Certainly <hi>Vain Glory</hi> helpeth to perpetuate a Man's Memory; and Virtue was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo beholden to humane Nature, as it received his due at the Second Hand.

                  <p>THE Winning of <hi>Honour</hi> is but the revealing of Man's Virtue and Worth without Diſadvantage. For ſome in their Actions do woo and affect <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Reputation;</hi> which ſort of Men are commonly much talked of, but inwardly little admired. And ſome, contrariwiſe, darken their Virtue in the ſhew of it, ſo as they be undervalued in Opinion. If a Man perform that which hath not been attempted before, or attempted and given over, or hath been atchieved, but not with ſo good circumſtance, he ſhall purchaſe more <hi>Honour,</hi> than by effecting a matter of greater difficulty or virtue, wherein he is but a follower. If a Man ſo temper his Actions, as in ſome one of them he doth content every Faction or Combination of People, the Muſick will be the fuller. A Man is an ill Husband of his <hi>Honour</hi> that entreth into any Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the failing wherein may diſgrace him more than the carrying of it through can <hi>Honour</hi> him. <hi>Honour</hi> that is gained and broken upon another, hath the quickeſt reflection, like Diamonds cut with Faſcets. And therefore let a Man contend to excel any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitors of his in <hi>Honour,</hi> in out-ſhooting them, if he can, in their own Bow. Diſcreet Followers and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants help much to <hi>Reputation: Omnis fama à Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticis emanat.</hi> Envy, which is the Canker of <hi>Honour</hi> is beſt extinguiſhed by declaring a Man's ſelf in his ends, rather to ſeek Merit than Fame; and by attributing a Man's ſucceſſes, rather to Divine Providence and Felicity than to his own Virtue or Policy. The true marſhalling of the Degrees of <hi>Soveraign Honour,</hi> are theſe. In the firſt place are, <hi>Conditores Imperiorum, Founders of States,</hi> and <hi>Commonwealths;</hi> ſuch as were
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:94631:77"/>
                     <hi>Romulus, Cyrus, Caeſar, Ottoman, Iſmael.</hi> In the ſecond place are, <hi>Legiſlatores, Law-givers;</hi> which are alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Second Founders,</hi> or <hi>Perpetui Principes,</hi> becauſe they govern by their Ordinances after they are gone; ſuch were <hi>Lycurgus, Solon, Justinian, Edgar, Alphonſus</hi> of <hi>Castile</hi> the wiſe, that made the <hi>Siete Patridas.</hi> In the third place are, <hi>Liberatores</hi> or <hi>Salvatores;</hi> ſuch as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound the long miſeries of Civil Wars, or deliver their Countreys from Servitude of Strangers or Tyrants; as <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar, Veſpaſianus, Aurelianus, Theodoricus,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh of <hi>England,</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth of <hi>France.</hi> In the fourth place are <hi>Propagatores,</hi> or <hi>Propugnatores Imperii;</hi> ſuch as in Honourable Wars enlarge their territories, or make noble defence againſt Invaders. And in the laſt place are <hi>Patres Patriae,</hi> which Reign juſtly, and make the times good wherein they live. Both which laſt kinds need no Examples, they are in ſuch number. Degrees of <hi>Honour</hi> in Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are: Firſt, <hi>Participes Curarum,</hi> thoſe upon whom Princes do diſcharge the greateſt Weight of their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, their <hi>Right Hands,</hi> as we call them. The next are, <hi>Duces Belli, Great Leaders,</hi> ſuch as are Princes Lieutenants, and do them notable ſervices in the Wars. The third are <hi>Gratioſi, Favourites,</hi> ſuch as need not this ſcantling, to be Solace to the Soveraign, and harmleſs to the People. And the fourth <hi>Negotiis Pares,</hi> ſuch as have great places under Princes, and execute their pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with ſufficiency. There is an <hi>Honour</hi> likewiſe which may be ranked amongſt the greateſt, which hapneth rarely, that is, of ſuch as <hi>Sacrifice themſelves to Death</hi> or <hi>Danger</hi> for the <hi>Good</hi> of their <hi>Countrey;</hi> as was <hi>M.

Judges</hi> ought to be more learned than Witty, more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend than Plauſible, and more adviſed than Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.

For certainly <hi>Grapes</hi> (as the Scripture ſaith) <hi>will not be gathered of Thorns or Thiſtles;</hi> neither can <hi>Juſtice</hi> yield her Fruit with Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs amongſt the Briars and Brambles of Catching and Poling <hi>Clerks</hi> and <hi>Miniſters.</hi> The Attendance of Courts is ſubject to four bad Inſtruments: Firſt, Certain Perſons that are ſowers of Suits which make the Court ſwell, and the Country pine.

                     </gap> puffing a Court up beyond her bounds, for their own Scraps and Advantage. The third ſort is, Of thoſe that may be accounted the Left hands of Courts; Perſons that are full of nimble and finiſter tricks and ſhifts, whereby they pervert the plain and direct Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of <hi>Courts,</hi> and bring Juſtice into oblique Lines and Labyrinths. And the fourth is, the Poller and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of Fees, which juſtifies the common reſemblance of the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Justice</hi> to the <hi>Buſh,</hi> whereunto while the ſheep flies for Defence in Weather, he is ſure to loſe part of his Fleece. On the other ſide, an <hi>Ancient Clerk,</hi> skilful in Precedents, wary in proceeding, and underſtanding in the <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of the <hi>Court,</hi> is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Finger of a <hi>Court,</hi> and doth many times point the way to the <hi>Judge</hi> himſelf.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, For that which may concern the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign</hi> and <hi>Eſtate. Judges</hi> ought above all to remember the concluſion of the <hi>Roman Twelve Tables, Salus Popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li Suprema Lex;</hi> and to know, that Laws, except they be in order to that end, are but things captious, and Oracles not well inſpired. Therefore it is an happy thing in a <hi>State,</hi> when <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>States</hi> do often con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with <hi>Judges;</hi> and again, when <hi>Judges</hi> do often conſult with the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>State:</hi> The one, when there is a matter of Law intervenient in buſineſs of State; The other, when there is ſome conſideration of State intervenient in matter of Law. For many times the things deduced to <hi>Judgment</hi> may be <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum,</hi> when the reaſon and conſequence thereof may Trench to point of <hi>Estate.</hi> I call matter of Eſtate not only the parts of <hi>Soveraignty,</hi> but whatſoever introduceth any great Alteration, or dangerous Precedent, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerneth manifeſtly any great portion of People. And let no Man weakly conceive, that Juſt Laws and true Policy have any <hi>Antipathy:</hi> For they are like Spirits and Sinews, that one moves with the other.

                  <p>TO ſeek to extinguiſh <hi>Anger</hi> utterly, is but a brave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the Stoicks. We have better Oracles: <hi>Be angry, but ſin not. Let not the Sun go down upon your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Anger</hi> muſt be limited and confined, both in Race and Time. We will firſt ſpeak, how the Natural In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination and Habit <hi>to be angry,</hi> may be attempted and calmed. Secondly, How the particular motions of <hi>anger</hi> may be repreſſed, or at leaſt refrained from do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſchief. Thirdly, How to raiſe <hi>anger,</hi> or appeaſe <hi>anger</hi> in another.</p>
                  <p>For the firſt: There is no other way but to Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate and Ruminate well upon the effects of <hi>Anger,</hi> how it troubles Man's Life. And the beſt time to do this is, to look back upon <hi>Anger,</hi> when the fit is throughly over. <hi>Seneca</hi> ſaith well; <hi>That Anger is like Ruine, which breaks it ſelf upon that it falls.</hi> The Scripture exhorteth us, <hi>To poſſeſs our Souls in patience.</hi> Whoſoever is out of <hi>patience,</hi> is out of Poſſeſſion of his <hi>Soul.</hi> Men muſt not turn Bees;</p>

                     <hi>Anger</hi> is certainly a kind of Baſeneſs; as it appears <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>gns, Children, Women, Old Folks, Sick Folks. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Men muſt beware, that they carry their <hi>Anger</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Scorn, than with Fear: So that they may ſeem rather to be above the injury than below it, which is a thing eaſily done, if a Man will give Law to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in it.</p>
                  <p>For the ſecond Point. The <hi>Cauſes</hi> and <hi>Motives</hi> of <hi>Anger</hi> are chiefly three: Firſt, to be too <hi>ſenſible</hi> of <hi>hurt:</hi> For no Man is <hi>Angry</hi> that feels not himſelf hurt; and therefore tender and delicate Perſons muſt needs be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Angry:</hi> They have ſo many things to trouble them, which more robuſt Natures have little ſence of. The next is, the Apprehenſion and Conſtruction of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury offered, to be in the circumſtances thereof, full of <hi>contempt.</hi> For <hi>contempt</hi> is that which putteth an edge upon <hi>Anger,</hi> as much or more than the <hi>hurt</hi> it ſelf: And therefore when Men are ingenious in picking out circumſtances of <hi>contempt,</hi> they do kindle their <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> much. Laſtly, Opinion of the touch of a Man's <hi>Reputation</hi> doth multiply and ſharpen <hi>Anger:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the remedy is, that a Man ſhould have, as <hi>Gonſalvo</hi> was wont to ſay, <hi>Telam Honoris Craſſiorem.</hi> But in all refrainings of <hi>Anger,</hi> it is the beſt remedy to win Time, and to make a Man's ſelf believe that the Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his revenge is not yet come; but that he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees a time for it, and ſo to ſtill himſelf in the mean time, and reſerve it.</p>
                  <p>To contain <hi>Anger</hi> from <hi>Miſchief,</hi> though it take hold of a Man, there be two things, whereof you muſt have ſpecial Caution: The one, of extream <hi>bitterneſs of Words,</hi> eſpecially if they be Aculeate and Proper; for <hi>Communia Maledicta</hi> are nothing ſo much. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, That in <hi>Anger</hi> a Man reveal no Secrets; for that makes him not fit for Society. The other, That you do not <hi>peremptorily break off</hi> in any buſineſs in a fit of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:94631:81"/>
                     <hi>Anger;</hi> but howſoever you <hi>ſhew</hi> bitterneſs, do not <hi>act</hi> any thing that is not revocable.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>raiſing</hi> and <hi>appeaſing Anger</hi> in another: It is do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap> chiefly by <hi>chuſing</hi> of <hi>Times;</hi> when Men are frowardeſt and worſt diſpoſed, to incenſe them. Again, by ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering (as was touched before) all that you can find out to aggravate the <hi>contempt;</hi> and the two <hi>remedies</hi> are by the <hi>contraries:</hi> The former, to take good Times, when firſt to relate to a Man an <hi>angry</hi> buſineſs: For the firſt Impreſſion is much; and the other is, to ſever as much as may be the Conſtruction of the Injury from the Point of <hi>contempt;</hi> imputing it to Miſunderſtanding, Fear, Paſſion, or what you will.</p>

                     <hi>SOLOMON</hi> ſaith, <hi>There is no new thing upon the Earth.</hi> So that as <hi>Plato</hi> had an imagination, <hi>That all knowledge was but a remembrance:</hi> So <hi>Solomon</hi> giveth his ſentence, <hi>That all Novelty is but Oblivion:</hi> Whereby you may ſee, That the River of <hi>Lethe</hi> runneth as well above ground as below. There is an abſtruſe Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger that ſaith, <hi>If it were not for two things that are conſtant, (The one is, That the fixed Stars ever ſtand at like distance one from another, and never come nearer together, nor go further aſunder; the other, That the Diurnal Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on perpetually keepeth Time) no Individual would laſt one moment.</hi> Certain it is, That the <hi>matter</hi> is in a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Flux, and never at a ſtay.

But in the other two Deſtructions, by <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge</hi> and <hi>Earthquake,</hi> it is further to be noted, That the remnant of People which hap to be reſerved, are commonly ignorant and mountainous People, that can give no account of the time paſt; ſo that the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion is all one, as if none had been left. If you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well of the People of the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> it is very probable, that they are a newer or younger People, than the People of the Old World. And it is much more likely, that the deſtruction that hath heretofore been there, was not by <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> (as the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Prieſt told <hi>Solon,</hi> concerning the Iſland of <hi>Atlantis, That it was ſwallowed by an Earthquake)</hi> but rather, it was Deſolated by a particular <hi>Deluge:</hi> For <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes</hi> are ſeldom in thoſe parts. But on the other ſide, they have ſuch <hi>pouring Rivers,</hi> as the <hi>Rivers</hi> of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> and <hi>Europe,</hi> are but Brooks to them. Their <hi>Andes</hi> likewiſe, or Mountains, are far higher than thoſe with us; whereby it ſeems, that the Remnants of Generations of Men were in ſuch a particular <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge</hi> ſaved. As for the obſervation that <hi>Michiavel</hi> hath, That the <hi>Jealouſie</hi> of <hi>Sects</hi> doth much extinguiſh the memory of things; traducing <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, that he did what in him lay to extinguiſh all Heathen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities.

                  <p>Upon the <hi>Breaking</hi> and <hi>Shivering</hi> of a great <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Empire,</hi> you may be ſure to have <hi>Wars.</hi> For great Empires, while they ſtand, do enervate and deſtroy the forces of the Natives which they have ſubdued, reſting upon their own Protecting forces; and then when they fail alſo, all goes to ruine, and they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Prey. So was it in the decay of the <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> and likewiſe in the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Almain,</hi> after <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, every Bird taking a Feather, and were not unlike to befall to <hi>Spain,</hi> if it ſhould break. The great <hi>Acceſſions</hi> and <hi>Unions</hi> of <hi>Kingdoms</hi> do likewiſe ſtir up <hi>Wars.</hi> For when a State grows to an Over-power, it is like a great flood that will be ſure to over-flow. As it hath been ſeen in the States of <hi>Rome, Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie, Spain,</hi> and others. Look when the World hath feweſt <hi>Barbarous People,</hi> but ſuch as commonly will not marry or generate, except they know means to live; (as it is almoſt every where at this day, except <hi>Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary)</hi> there is no danger of Inundations of People; but when there be <hi>great Shoals</hi> of <hi>People,</hi> which go on to populate without foreſeeing means of Life and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtentation, it is of neceſſity that once in an Age or two, they diſcharge a Portion of their People upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations, which the ancient <hi>Northern People</hi> were wont to do by Lot, caſting Lot what part ſhould ſtay at home, and what ſhould ſeek their Fortunes. When a <hi>Warlike State</hi> grows <hi>ſoft</hi> and <hi>effeminate,</hi> they may be ſure of a <hi>War;</hi> for commonly ſuch States are grown rich in the time of their Degenerating, and ſo the Prey inviteth, and their decay in valour encourageth a War.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Weapons,</hi> it hardly falleth under Rule and Obſervation; yet we ſee even they have <hi>Returns</hi> and <hi>Viciſſitudes.</hi> For certain it is, that <hi>Ordnance</hi> was known
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:94631:83"/>

                  <head>LX. <hi>A Civil Character of</hi> Julius Caeſar.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>JULIUS CAESAR</hi> was partaker at firſt of an exerciſed Fortune; which turned to his benefit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For it abated the haughtineſs of his ſpirit, and whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his Induſtry. He had a Mind, <hi>turbulent</hi> in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and Affections; but in his judgment and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding very <hi>ſerene</hi> and <hi>placid:</hi> And this appears by his eaſie deliverances of himſelf, both in his Tranſacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and in his Speech. For no Man ever reſolved more ſwiftly, or ſpake more perſpicuouſly and plainly. There was nothing forced or difficult in his expreſſions. But in his will and appetite, he was of that Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he never reſted in thoſe things he had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; but ſtill thirſted and purſued after new; yet ſo, that he would not ruſh into new Affairs raſhly, but ſettle and make an end of the former, before he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted freſh Actions. So that he would put a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable period to all his Undertakings. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though he won many Battles in <hi>Spain,</hi> and weakned their <hi>Forces</hi> by degrees; yet he would not give over, nor deſpiſe the Relicks of the <hi>Civil War</hi> there, till he had ſeen all things compoſed: But then aſſoon as that was done, and the State ſetled, inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he advanced in his Expedition againſt the <hi>Parthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was, no doubt, of a very noble Mind; but yet ſuch as aimed more at his <hi>particular Advancement,</hi> than at any <hi>Merits</hi> for the <hi>Common Good.</hi> For he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred all things to <hi>Himſelf;</hi> and was the true and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Centre</hi> of all his Actions. By which means, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo faſt tied to his Ends, he was ſtill proſperous, and prevailed in his Purpoſes; Inſomuch, that neither <hi>Country,</hi> nor <hi>Religion,</hi> nor good <hi>Turns</hi> done him, nor
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:94631:85"/>
                     <hi>Kindred,</hi> nor <hi>Friendſhip</hi> diverted his Appetite, nor brid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led him from purſuing his own Ends. Neither was he much inclined to <hi>works</hi> of <hi>Perpetuity:</hi> For he eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing for the future; He founded no ſumptuous <hi>Buildings;</hi> He procured to be enacted no wholſome <hi>Laws,</hi> but ſtill minded himſelf: And ſo his thoughts were confined within the Circle of his own Life. He ſought indeed after <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Reputation,</hi> becauſe he thought they might be profitable to his Deſigns: Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in his inward thoughts be propounded to himſelf rather <hi>Abſoluteneſs</hi> of <hi>Power,</hi> than <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Fame.</hi> For as for <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Fame,</hi> he purſued not after them for themſelves; but becauſe they were the Inſtruments of <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs.</hi> And therefore he was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on through a Natural Inclination, not by any Rules that he had learned, to effect the ſole <hi>Regiment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and rather to <hi>enjoy</hi> the ſame than to <hi>ſeem worthy</hi> of it. And by this means he won much Reputation amongſt the <hi>People,</hi> who are no valuers of true Worth: But a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Nobility</hi> and great Men, who were tender of their own Honours, it procured him no more than this, that he incurred the Brand of an <hi>Ambitious</hi> and <hi>Daring Man.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither did they much err from the Truth who thought him ſo; for he was by Nature exceeding <hi>bold;</hi> and never did put on any ſhew of <hi>Modeſty,</hi> except it were for ſome purpoſes. Yet notwithſtanding, he ſo attempted his <hi>Boldneſs,</hi> that it neither impeached him of Raſhneſs; nor was burthenſome to Men; nor rendred his Nature ſuſpected, but was conceived to flow out of an Innate Sincerity and freeneſs of Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and the <hi>Nobility</hi> of his <hi>Birth:</hi> And in all other things he paſſed, not for a <hi>Crafty</hi> and <hi>Deceitful</hi> Perſon, but for an <hi>open hearted</hi> and <hi>plain-dealing</hi> Man. And whereas he was indeed an <hi>Arch-Politician,</hi> that could counterfeit and diſſemble ſufficiently well; and was wholly compounded of <hi>Frauds</hi> and <hi>Deceits,</hi> ſo that there was nothing <hi>ſincere</hi> in him, but all <hi>artificial;</hi> yet he
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:94631:86"/>
covered, and diſguiſed himſelf ſo, that no ſuch Vices, appeared to the Eyes of the World; but he was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally reputed to proceed plainly and uprightly with all Men. Howbeit, he did not ſtoop to any petty and mean <hi>Artifices,</hi> as they do, which are ignorant in State Employments; and depend not ſo much upon the ſtrength of their own Wits, as upon the Counſels and Brains of others, to ſupport their Authority; for he was skilled in the Turnings of all Humane Affairs; and tranſacted all Matters, eſpecially thoſe of high Conſequence by himſelf, and not by others.</p>
                  <p>He was ſingularly skilful to avoid <hi>Envy;</hi> and found it not impertinent to his Ends, to decline that, though it were with ſome diminution of his <hi>Dignity.</hi> For aiming at a <hi>Real Power,</hi> he was content to paſs by all vain Pomp and outward ſhews of Power throughout his whole Life; Till at the laſt, whether high-flown with the continual <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of <hi>Power,</hi> or corrupted with <hi>Flatteries,</hi> he affected the <hi>Enſigns</hi> of <hi>Power,</hi> (the <hi>Stile</hi> and <hi>Diad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>m</hi> of a <hi>King,)</hi> which was the Bait that wrought his Overthrow.</p>
                  <p>This is true, that he harboured the thoughts of a <hi>Kingdom</hi> from his very youth: And hereunto the <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> of <hi>Sylla,</hi> and the <hi>Kindred</hi> of <hi>Marius,</hi> and his <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation</hi> of <hi>Pompey,</hi> and the <hi>Corruption</hi> and <hi>Ambition</hi> of the <hi>Times,</hi> did prick him forward: But then he paved his way to a <hi>Kingdom,</hi> after a wonderful and ſtrange manner. As firſt, by a <hi>Popular</hi> and <hi>Seditious</hi> Power; afterwards by a <hi>Military Power,</hi> and that of a <hi>General in War.</hi> For there was required to effect his Ends; Firſt, That he ſhould break the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Senate;</hi> which, as long as it ſtood firm, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and an hindrance, that no Man could climb to <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Imperial Command.</hi> Then the <hi>Power</hi> of <hi>Craſſus</hi> and <hi>Pompey</hi> was to be ſubdued and quelled, which could not be done otherwiſe, than by <hi>Arms.</hi> And therefore (as the moſt <hi>Cunning Contriver</hi> of his own <hi>Fortune)</hi> he laid his firſt Foundation by <hi>Bribes;</hi>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:94631:86"/>
By corrupting the <hi>Courts</hi> of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> by renewing the <hi>memory</hi> of <hi>Caius Marius,</hi> and his party; For moſt of the <hi>Senators</hi> and <hi>Nobility</hi> were of <hi>Sylla's Faction:</hi> by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>diſtributing</hi> the <hi>Fields</hi> amongſt the <hi>Common People:</hi> by the <hi>Sedition</hi> of the <hi>Tribunes,</hi> where he was the <hi>Author:</hi> by the <hi>madneſs</hi> and <hi>fury</hi> of <hi>Catiline,</hi> and the <hi>Conſpirators,</hi> unto which Action he ſecretly blew the <hi>Goals!</hi> By the <hi>Baniſhment</hi> of <hi>Cicero,</hi> which was the greateſt Blow, to the <hi>Authority</hi> of the <hi>Senate,</hi> as might be; and ſeveral other the like <hi>Arts:</hi> But moſt of all by the <hi>Conjunction</hi> of <hi>Craſſus</hi> and <hi>Pompey,</hi> both betwixt themſelves, and with him; which was the thing that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the work.</p>
                  <p>Having accompliſht this part, he betook himſelf to the other; which was to <hi>make uſe</hi> of, and to <hi>enjoy</hi> his <hi>power.</hi> For being made <hi>Proconſul</hi> of <hi>France</hi> for five years; and afterwards continuing it for five years more; he furniſhed himſelf with <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Legions,</hi> and the power of a Warlike and Opulent <hi>Province;</hi> as was formidable to <hi>Italy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Neither was he ignorant, that after he had ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned himſelf with <hi>Arms</hi> and a <hi>Military Power,</hi> neither <hi>Craſſus</hi> nor <hi>Pompey</hi> could ever be able to bear up againſt him; whereof the one truſted to his great Riches, the other to his Fame and Reputation; the one decayed through Age, the other in Power and Authority: And neither of them were grounded upon true and laſting Foundations. And the rather, for that he had obliged all the <hi>Senators</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates:</hi> And in a word, all thoſe that had any power in the <hi>Common-wealth,</hi> ſo firmly to himſelf, with private benefits, that he was fearleſs of any Combination or Oppoſition againſt his Deſigns, till he had openly invaded the <hi>Imperial Power.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Which things, though he always bare in his Mind, and at the laſt acted it, yet he did not lay down his former perſon; but coloured things ſo, that what with the reaſonableneſs of his Demands, what with
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:94631:87"/>
his pretences of Peace, and what with the moderate uſe of his Succeſſes, he turned all the <hi>Envy</hi> of the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe Party,</hi> and ſeemed to take up <hi>Arms</hi> upon neceſſity for his own preſervation and ſafety. But the falſeneſs of this pretence manifeſtly appeared; inaſmuch as ſoon after having obtained the <hi>Regal Power,</hi> all <hi>Civil War</hi> being appeaſed, and all his <hi>Rivals</hi> and <hi>Oppoſites,</hi> which might put him to any fear, being removed out of the way by the ſtroke of <hi>Death;</hi> notwithſtanding he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought of <hi>reſigning</hi> the <hi>Republick;</hi> no, nor ever made any ſhew or offer of <hi>reſigning</hi> the ſame. Which ſhewed plainly, that his ambition of being a <hi>King</hi> was ſetled in him, and remained with him unto his laſt breath. For he did not lay hold upon occaſions, as they hapned, but moulded and formed the occaſions, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf pleaſed.</p>
                  <p>His chief <hi>Abilities</hi> conſiſted in <hi>Martial Knowledge;</hi> in which he ſo excelled, that he could not only <hi>lead</hi> an Army, but <hi>mould</hi> an Army to his own liking. For he was not more skilful in managing Affairs, than in <hi>winning</hi> of Hearts. Neither did he affect this by any ordinary Diſcipline, as by inuring them to fulfil all his commands; or by ſtriking a ſhame into them to diſobey, or by carrying a ſevere Hand over them: But by ſuch a way as did wonderfully ſtir up an ala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crity and chearfulneſs in them: and did in a ſort aſſure him of the Victory aforehand, and which did oblige the Soldier to him, more than was fit for a <hi>Free Eſtate.</hi> Now whereas he was verſed in all kinds of <hi>Martial Knowledge,</hi> and joyned <hi>Civil Arts</hi> with the <hi>Arts</hi> of <hi>War;</hi> nothing came ſo ſuddenly, or ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lookt for upon him, for which he had not a remedy at hand: And nothing was ſo averſe, but that he could pick ſomething for his Turn and Benefit out of it.</p>
                  <p>He ſtood ſufficiently upon his <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs.</hi> For in great Battels, he would ſit at home in the <hi>Head Quarter,</hi> and manage all Things by <hi>Meſſages,</hi> which wrought him a double benefit. Firſt, that it ſecured
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:94631:87"/>
his <hi>Perſon</hi> more, and expoſed him the leſs to <hi>Danger.</hi> Secondly, that if at any time his <hi>Army</hi> was worſted, he could put new ſpirit into them with his own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and the <hi>Addition</hi> of <hi>freſh Forces,</hi> and turn the <hi>Fortune</hi> of the <hi>Day.</hi> In the conducting of his <hi>Wars,</hi> he would not only follow former <hi>Precedents,</hi> but he was able to deviſe and purſue new <hi>Stratagems,</hi> according as the accidents and occaſions required.</p>
                  <p>He was conſtant, and ſingularly kind, and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in his <hi>Friendſhips</hi> contracted. Notwithſtanding, he made choiſe of ſuch Friends, as a Man might eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſee, that he choſe them rather to be <hi>Inſtruments</hi> to his <hi>Ends,</hi> than for any <hi>Good will</hi> towards them. And whereas, by Nature, and out of a firm Reſolution, he adhered to this Principle; not to be eminent amongſt <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>deſerving</hi> Men; but to be chief amongſt <hi>Inferiours</hi> and <hi>Vaſſals:</hi> he choſe only mean and active Men, and ſuch as to whom himſelf might be all in all. And hereupon grew that ſaying; <hi>So let</hi> Caeſar <hi>live, though I die;</hi> and other Speeches of that kind. As for the <hi>Nobility,</hi> and thoſe that were his <hi>Peers,</hi> he contracted Friendſhip, with ſuch of them as might be uſeful to him; and admitted none to his <hi>Cabinet Council,</hi> but thoſe that had their Fortunes wholly depending up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him.</p>
                  <p>He was moderately furniſhed with good <hi>Literature,</hi> and the <hi>Arts;</hi> But in ſuch ſort as he applied his skill therein to <hi>Civil Policy.</hi> For he was well read in <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry:</hi> and was expert in <hi>Rhetorick,</hi> and the <hi>Art of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> And becauſe he attributed much to his good <hi>Stars,</hi> he would pretend more than an ordinary Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in <hi>Aſtronomy.</hi> As for <hi>Eloquence,</hi> and a prompt <hi>Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution,</hi> that was <hi>Natural</hi> to him, and <hi>pure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He was diſſolute, and propenſe to <hi>Voluptuouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Pleaſures;</hi> which ſerved well at firſt for a Cover to his <hi>Ambition.</hi> For no Man would imagine, that a Man ſo looſely given could harbour any Ambitious and Vaſt Thoughts in his Heart. Notwithſtanding, he ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned

For thoſe perſons which are of a turbulent Nature or Appetite, do commonly paſs their youth in many <hi>Errors;</hi> and about their middle, and then, and not before, they ſhew forth their <hi>Perfections;</hi> but thoſe that are of a ſedate and calm Nature, may be ripe for great and glorious Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their youth.

And therefore the way to <hi>amplifie</hi> any thing is to <hi>break</hi> it, and to make <hi>Anatomy</hi> of it in <hi>ſeveral parts,</hi> and to examine it according to <hi>ſeveral circumſtances.</hi> And this maketh the greater ſhew, if it be done <hi>without Order,</hi> for <hi>confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> maketh things <hi>muſter</hi> more. And beſides, what is ſet down by <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Diviſion,</hi> doth demonſtrate, that nothing is <hi>left out</hi> or <hi>omitted;</hi> but all is there: whereas,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:94631:96"/>
if it be <hi>without Order,</hi> both the mind <hi>comprehendeth</hi> leſs that which is ſet down, and beſides it leaveth a ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, as if <hi>more</hi> might be <hi>ſaid</hi> than is <hi>expreſſed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Colour</hi> deceiveth, if the mind of him that is to be perſwaded, do of it ſelf <hi>overconceive</hi> or <hi>prejudge</hi> of the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of any thing; for then the <hi>breaking</hi> of it will make it ſeem <hi>leſs,</hi> becauſe it makes it to appear more according to the <hi>Truth.</hi> And therefore, if a Man be in <hi>Sickneſs</hi> or Pain, the time will ſeem longer <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Clock,</hi> or <hi>Hourglaſs,</hi> than <hi>with</hi> it: for the mind doth <hi>value every moment;</hi> and then the <hi>Hour</hi> doth ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>ſum up</hi> the <hi>moments</hi> than <hi>divide</hi> the <hi>Day.</hi> So in a <hi>dead Plain</hi> the <hi>way</hi> ſeemeth the <hi>longer,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Eye</hi> hath pre-conceived it <hi>ſhorter,</hi> than the truth: and the <hi>fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strating</hi> of that maketh it ſeem <hi>longer</hi> than the truth. Therefore, if any Man have an <hi>over-great Opinion</hi> of any thing, then if another think, by <hi>breaking</hi> it into <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Conſiderations,</hi> he ſhall make it ſeem <hi>greater</hi> to him, he will be <hi>deceived.</hi> And therefore, in ſuch <hi>Caſes,</hi> it is not ſafe to <hi>divide,</hi> but to <hi>extol</hi> the <hi>Entire</hi> ſtill <hi>in general.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another <hi>Caſe,</hi> wherein this <hi>Colour</hi> deceiveth, is, when the matter <hi>broken,</hi> or <hi>divided,</hi> is not <hi>comprehended</hi> by the ſence, or <hi>made at once</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>diſtracting</hi> or <hi>ſcattering</hi> of it: and being <hi>entire,</hi> and not <hi>divided,</hi> is <hi>comprehended.</hi> As an <hi>Hundred Pounds</hi> in Heaps of <hi>five Pounds</hi> will ſhew <hi>more</hi> than in one groſs Heap: ſo as the Heaps be all upon <hi>one Table</hi> to be ſeen at once, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe not. As <hi>Flowers,</hi> growing ſcattered in <hi>divers</hi> Beds, will ſhew <hi>more,</hi> than if they did grow in <hi>one</hi> Bed: ſo as all thoſe <hi>Beds</hi> be within a <hi>Plot,</hi> that they be object to view <hi>at once;</hi> otherwiſe not. And therefore <hi>men,</hi> whoſe Living lyeth <hi>together in one Shire,</hi> are commonly counted <hi>greater landed,</hi> than thoſe, whoſe Livings are <hi>diſperſed,</hi> though it be <hi>more;</hi> becauſe of the <hi>notice</hi> and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A third <hi>Caſe,</hi> wherein this <hi>Colour</hi> deceiveth, which is not ſo properly a <hi>Caſe</hi> or <hi>Reprehenſion,</hi> as it is a <hi>counter Colour,</hi> being in effect as <hi>large</hi> as the <hi>Colour</hi> it ſelf is,

That</hi> every Compoſition ſeems to partake of a certain want; becauſe, if <hi>one</hi> thing would ſerve the turn, it were ever <hi>beſt;</hi> but it is the <hi>Defect</hi> and <hi>Imperfection</hi> of things that hath brought in that help to <hi>piece</hi> them <hi>up:</hi> as it is ſaid, <note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 10. 41, 42.</note>

                     </q>
And in the <hi>Moral</hi> of this <hi>Fable,</hi> it comes likewiſe to paſs, That <hi>a good ſure Friend is a better help at a pinch, than all the Stratagems and Policies of Man's own wit.</hi> So it falleth out to be a <hi>common Error</hi> in <hi>Negotiating;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as Men have <hi>many</hi> Reaſons to <hi>induce</hi> or <hi>perſwade,</hi> they ſtrive commonly to utter, and uſe them <hi>all at once,</hi> which <hi>weakeneth</hi> them.

Indeed, in a <hi>ſet Speech</hi> in an <hi>Aſſembly,</hi> it is expected, a Man ſhould uſe <hi>all</hi> his <hi>Reaſons</hi> in the <hi>Caſe</hi> he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth: but in <hi>private perſwaſions</hi> it is always a <hi>great Error.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A fourth <hi>Caſe,</hi> wherein this <hi>Colour</hi> may be <hi>reprehended</hi> is in reſpect of that ſame <hi>vis unita fortior,</hi> the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged <hi>ſtrength</hi> of an <hi>united Power;</hi> according to the <hi>Tale</hi> of the <hi>FRENCH King,</hi> who, when the <hi>Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's Embaſſador</hi> had recited his <hi>Master's Style</hi> at large, which conſiſteth of <hi>many Countries,</hi> and <hi>Dominions,</hi> the <hi>FRENCH KING</hi> willed his <hi>Chancellor,</hi> or other <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter,</hi> to repeat over <hi>FRANCE</hi> as many times as the other had recited the ſeveral <hi>Dominions;</hi> intending, it was <hi>equivalent</hi> with them <hi>all,</hi> and more <hi>compacted</hi> and <hi>united.</hi>

                  <p>There is alſo appertaining to this <hi>Colour</hi> another <hi>Point,</hi> why <hi>breaking</hi> of a thing doth help it; not by way of adding a ſhew of <hi>Magnitude</hi> unto it, but a note of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> and <hi>Rarity:</hi> whereof the <hi>Forms</hi> are, <hi>Where you ſhall find ſuch a Conourrence?

                  <q>That, whoſe Privation <hi>(or,</hi> the want of which) is Good, is in it ſelf <hi>Evil:</hi> that whoſe Privation <hi>(or,</hi> the want thereof) is an Evil, is in it ſelf <hi>Good.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>THE <hi>Forms</hi> to make it conceived, that that was <hi>Evil,</hi> which is changed for the <hi>better, are, He that is in Hell thinks there is no Heaven.

And on the other ſide, the <hi>forms</hi> to make it conceived, that that was <hi>good,</hi> which was changed for the <hi>worſe,</hi> are; <hi>Bona magis carendo quam fruendo ſentimus: That is,</hi> we underſtand the Goodneſs of things more by wanting, than enjoying them. <hi>Bona à tergo formoſiſſima:</hi> i. e. <hi>Good things never appear in their full Beauty, till they turn their back, and be going away,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Reprehenſion</hi> of this <hi>Colour</hi> is, That the <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi> which is <hi>removed,</hi> may be eſteemed <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil comparatively:</hi> and not <hi>poſitively</hi> or <hi>ſimply.</hi> So that if the <hi>Privation</hi> be <hi>Good,</hi> it follows not, that the <hi>former</hi> condition was <hi>Evil,</hi> but <hi>leſs Good:</hi> For the <hi>Flower</hi> or <hi>Bloſſom</hi> is a <hi>poſitive</hi> Good; although the <hi>remove</hi> of it, to give place to the <hi>Fruit,</hi> be a <hi>comparative</hi> Good. So in the <hi>Tale</hi> of <hi>Aeſop,</hi> when the <hi>old fainting</hi> man in the <hi>heat</hi> of the day caſt down his <hi>Burthen,</hi> and called for <hi>Death;</hi> and when <hi>Death</hi> came to know his <hi>will</hi> with him, ſaid, <hi>It was for nothing, but to help him up with his burthen again:</hi> It doth not follow, that becauſe <hi>Death,</hi> which was the <hi>privation</hi> of the <hi>Burthen,</hi> was <hi>ill,</hi> therefore the <hi>Burthen</hi> was <hi>good.</hi> And in this part the ordinary <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Malum Neceſſarium,</hi> a neceſſary Evil, aptly <hi>reprehended</hi> this <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour:</hi> For <hi>privatio mali neceſſarii eſt mala,</hi> the privation of a neceſſary Evil is Evil; and yet that doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>neceſſary Evil,</hi> but it is <hi>Evil.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>THis Colour ſeems to ſtand upon this Foundation, That it may well be believed, that the force of Truth extorts from us whatſoever we affirm to be againſt our Wills, and contrary to the bent and inclination of our Minds.</p>
                  <p>This Colour deceives through the ſubtilty, as well of Enemies as Friends: For the praiſes of Enemies are not always againſt their Wills, nor as forc'd by Truth, but they chuſe to beſtow them in ſuch caſes where they may create Envy or Danger to their Adverſaries. Therefore the <hi>Grecians</hi> had a ſuperſtitious Fancy, that if a Man were commended by another out of ſpight, and with a miſchievous deſign, he would have a puſh riſe upon his Noſe: Beſides, ſometimes Enemies beſtow Praiſes, like Preambles as twere, that they may the more freely and maliciouſly calumniate. On the other ſide, this Colour deceives, from the craft of Friends; for they'll ſometimes take notice of the faults of their Friends, and ſpeak freely of them; but they chuſe ſuch as may do them little hurt, as if for all the reſt they were the beſt Men in the World. Again, it deceives, becauſe Friends uſe their Reprehenſions (as we ſaid Enemies do their Commendations) as certain little Prefaces, after which they may expatiate more freely in their Praiſes.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE Antiquities of the firſt Age (except thoſe we find in Sacred Writ) were buried in Oblivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Silence: Silence was ſucceeded by Poetical Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; and fables again were followed by the Records we now enjoy. So that the Myſteries and Secrets of Antiquity were diſtinguiſhed and ſeparated from the Records and Evidences of ſucceeding Times by the veil of Fiction, which interpoſed it ſelf, and came between thoſe things which periſhed, and thoſe which are extant. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſome are of opinion, that my purpoſe is to write Toys and Trifles, and to uſurp the ſame liberty in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying, that the Poets aſſumed in feigning, which I might do (I confeſs) if I liſted, and with more ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous contemplation intermix theſe things, to delight ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my ſelf in Meditation, or others in Reading. Neither am I ignorant how fickle and inconſtant a thing Fiction is, as being ſubject to be drawn and wreſted any way, and how great the commodity of Wit and Diſcourſe is, that is able to apply things well, yet ſo as never meant by the firſt Authors. But I remember that this liberty hath been lately much abuſed, in that many, to purchaſe the reverence of Antiquity to their own Inventions and Fancies, have for the ſame intent laboured to wreſt many Poetical Fables: Neither hath this old and common Vanity been uſed only of late, or now and then<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> For even <hi>Chryſippus</hi> long ago did (as an
<pb facs="tcp:94631:106"/>
Interpreter of Dreams) aſcribe the Opinions of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks to the Ancient Poets; and more ſottiſhly do the <hi>Chymiſts</hi> appropriate the Fancies and Delights of Poets in the Transformation of Bodies, to the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Fornace. All theſe things, I ſay, I have ſufficiently conſidered and weighed, and in them have ſeen and noted the general Levity and Indulgence of Men's Wits above Allegories; and yet for all this I relinquiſh not my Opinion.</p>
                  <p>For firſt it may not be, that the Folly and Looſeneſs of a few ſhould altogether detract from the reſpect due to the Parables: For that were a conceipt which might ſavour of Profaneneſs and Preſumption: For Religion it ſelf doth ſometimes delight in ſuch Veils and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows: So that who ſo exempts them, ſeems in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to interdict all Commerce between things Divine and Humane. But concerning Humane Wiſdom, I do indeed ingenuouſly and freely confeſs, that I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to imagine, that under ſome of the Ancient Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons lay couched certain Myſteries and Allegories, even from their firſt invention. And I am perſuaded (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther raviſhed with the Reverence of Antiquity, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in ſome Fables I find ſuch ſingular proportion between the ſimilitude and the thing ſignified; and ſuch apt and clear coherence in the very Structure of them, and propriety of Names wherewith the Perſons or Actors in them are inſcribed and intituled) that no man can conſtantly deny; but this Senſe was in the Authors intent and meaning, when they firſt invented them, and that they purpoſely ſhadowed it in this ſort: For who can be ſo ſtupid and blind in the open Light, as (when he hears how Fame, after the Giants were deſtroyed, ſprung up as their youngest Siſter)
<pb facs="tcp:94631:106"/>
not to refer it to the Murmurs and ſeditious Reports of both ſides, which are wont to fly abroad for a time after the ſuppreſſing of Inſurrections? Or when he hears how the Giant <hi>Typhon,</hi> having cut out and brought away <hi>Jupite</hi> 's Nerves, which <hi>Mercury</hi> ſtole from him, and reſtored again to <hi>Jupiter;</hi> doth not preſently perceive how fitly it may be applied to powerful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, which take from Princes their Sinews of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Authority; but ſo, that by affability of Speech, and wiſe Edicts (the Minds of their Subjects being in time privily, and as it were by ſtealth reconciled) they recover their ſtrength again? Or when he hears how (in that memorable Expedition of the Gods a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>Giants)</hi> the braying of <hi>Silenus</hi> his Aſs, conduced much to the profligation of the <hi>Giants,</hi> doth not confidently imagine that it was invented to ſhew how the greateſt enterprizes of Rebels are oftentimes diſperſed with vain Rumors and Fears.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, to what Judgment can the Conformity and Signification of Names ſeem obſcure? Seeing <hi>Metis,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> doth plainly ſignifie Counſel: <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> Inſurrection: <hi>Pan,</hi> 
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality: <hi>Nemeſis,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, and the like: Neither let it trouble any man, if ſometimes he meet with Hiſtorical Narrations, or Additions for Ornament's ſake, or confuſion of Times, or ſomething transferred from one Fable to another, to bring in a new Allegory: For it could be no otherwiſe, ſeeing they were the Inventions of Men, which lived in divers Ages, and had alſo divers Ends: Some be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ancient, others neoterical; ſome have an eye to things Natural, others to Moral.</p>
                  <p>There is another Argument, and that no ſmall one neither, to prove that theſe Fables contain certain hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
<pb facs="tcp:94631:107"/>
and involved meanings, ſeeing ſome of them are obſerved to be ſo abſurd, and fooliſh in the very rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they ſhew, and as it were proclaim a Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble afar of: For ſuch Tales as are probable, they may ſeem to be invented for delight, and in imitation of Hiſtory. And as for ſuch as no man would ſo much as imagine or relate, they ſeem to be ſought out for other ends: For what kind of Fiction is that, wherein <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> is ſaid to have taken <hi>Metis</hi> to Wife; and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that ſhe was with Child, to have devoured her; whence himſelf conceiving, brought forth <hi>Pallas</hi> armed, out of his Head? Truly, I think there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Dream (ſo different to the courſe of Cogitation, and ſo full of Monſtroſity,) ever hatch'd in the Brain of Man. Above all things, this prevails moſt with me and is of ſingular moment, many of theſe Fables ſeem not to be invented of thoſe by whom they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and celebrated, as by <hi>Homer, Heſiod</hi> and others. For if it were ſo, that they took beginning in that Age, and from thoſe Authors by whom they are delivered<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and brought to our hands: My Mind gives me, there could be no great or high Matter expected, or ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to proceed from them in reſpect of theſe Originals. But if with attention we conſider the Matter, it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that they were delivered, and related as things formerly believed, and received, and not as newly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, and offered unto us. Beſides, ſeeing they are diverſly related by Writers that lived near about one and the ſelf-ſame time, we may eaſily perceive that they were common things, derived from precedent Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials; and that they became various<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by reaſon of the divers Ornaments beſtowed on them by particular Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: And the conſideration of this muſt needs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
<pb facs="tcp:94631:107"/>
in us a great opinion of them, as not to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted either the effects off the time, or inventions of the Poets, but as ſacred Relicks, or abſtracted Airs of better times, which by Tradition from more Ancient Nations, fell into the Trumpets and Flutes of the <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</hi> But if any do obſtinately contend, That Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories are always adventitially, and as it were by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, never naturally, and properly included in Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, we will not be much troubleſome, but ſuffer them to enjoy that gravity of Judgment, which I am ſure they affect, although indeed it be but lumpiſh, and almoſt leaden. And (if they be worthy to be taken notice of,) we will begin a freſh with them in ſome other faſhion.</p>
                  <p>There is ſound among Men, (and it goes for current,) a twofold uſe of Parables, and thoſe, (which is more to be admired) referred to contrary ends; conducing as well to the folding up, and keeping of things under a Veil, as to the enlightning and laying open of obſcurities. But omitting the former, (rather than to undergo wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and aſſuming ancient Fables as things vagrant, and compoſed only for delight,) the latter muſt queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onleſs ſtill remain as not to be wreſted from us by any violence of Wit, neither can any (that is but meanly learned) hinder; but it muſt abſolutely be received, as a thing grave, and ſober, free from all vanity, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceeding profitable, and neceſſary to all Sciences. This is it, I ſay, that leads the underſtanding of Man by an eaſie and gentle paſſage through all novel and abſtruſe inventions, which any way differ from common received Opinions. Therefore in the firſt Ages (when many humane Inventions and Concluſions, which are now common, and vulgar, were new, and not generally known,) all things were Full of Fables, Enigma's, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables,
<pb facs="tcp:94631:108"/>
and Similies of all ſorts: By which they ſought to teach, and lay open, not to hide and conceal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; eſpecially ſeeing the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings of Men were in thoſe times rude and impatient, and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of any Subtilties; ſuch things only excepted, as were the Object of Senſe; for as <hi>Hieroglyphicks</hi> preceeded Letters, ſo Parables were more ancient than Arguments. And in theſe days alſo, he that would il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate Mens minds anew in any old Matter, and that not with diſprofit, and harſhneſs, muſt abſolutely take the ſame Courſe, and uſe the help of Similies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after all that hath been ſaid, we muſt thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude: <hi>The Wiſdom of the Ancients,</hi> it was either much, or happy: Much, if theſe Figures and Tropes were invented by ſtudy and premeditation; Happy, if they (intending nothing leſs,) gave Matter, and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſo many worthy Meditations. As concerning my Labours, (if there be any thing in them which may do good,) I will on neither part count them ill beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, my purpoſe being to illuſtrate either Antiquity, or Things themſelves. Neither am I ignorant that this very Subject hath been attempted by others: But to ſpeak as I think, and that freely without oſtentation, the Dignity and Efficacy of the Thing, is almoſt loſt by theſe Men's Writings, though voluminous, and full of Pains, whilſt not diving into the depth of Matters, but skilful only in certain common places, have applied the ſenſe of theſe Parables to certain vulgar, and general Things, not ſo much as glancing at their true Vertue, genuine Propriety, and full Depth. I (if I be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,) ſhall be new in common Things. Wherefore leaving ſuch as are plain and open, I will aim at far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and richer Matters.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Poets</hi> Fable, That <hi>Apollo</hi> being enamour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of <hi>Caſſandra,</hi> was by her many ſhifts and cunning ſlights ſtill deluded in his Deſire; but yet fed on with hope, untill ſuch time as ſhe had drawn from him the Gift of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying; and having by ſuch her Diſſimulation, in the end, attained to that which from the beginning ſhe ſought after; at laſt, flatly rejected his Suit. Who find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf ſo far engaged in his Promiſe, as that he could not by any means revoke again his raſh Gift, and yet enſtamed with an earneſt deſire of Revenge, highly diſdaining to be made the ſcorn of a crafty Wench, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed a Penalty to his Promiſe, <hi>viz.</hi> that ſhe ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver foretel the truth, but never be believed: So were her Divinations always faithful, but at no time regarded; whereof ſhe ſtill found the experience, yea, even in the

ruine of her own Countrey, which ſhe had often fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned them of; but they neither gave credit nor ear to her words. This Fable ſeems to intimate the unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable liberty of untimely admonitions and counſels: For they that are ſo over-weened with the ſharpneſs and dexterity of their own wit and capacity, as that they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain to ſubmit themſelves to the documents of <hi>Apollo,</hi> the God of Harmony, whereby to learn and obſerve the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and meaſure of affairs the grace and gravity of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, the differences between the more judicious and more vulgar Ears, and the due times when to ſpeak, and when to be ſilent; be they never ſo ſenſible, and pregnant, and their judgments never ſo profound, and profitable; yet in all their endeavours either of perſwaſion, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force, they avail nothing, neither are they of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to advantage or manage matters; but do rather haſten on the ruine of all thoſe that they adhere, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote themſelves unto.

                     <hi>JUNO</hi> being vex'd (ſay the Poets) that <hi>Jupiter</hi> had begotten <hi>Pallas</hi> by himſelf without her, earneſtly preſſed all the other Gods and Goddeſſes that ſhe might alſo bring forth of her ſelf alone without him; and having by violence, and importunity obtained a grant thereof, ſhe ſmote the Earth, and forthwith ſprang up <hi>Typhon,</hi> a huge, and horrid Monſter: This ſtrange Birth ſhe commits to a Serpent, (as a Foſter-Father,) to nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh it; who no ſooner came to ripeneſs of years, but he provokes <hi>Jupiter</hi> to Battel: In the Conflict the Gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant getting the upper hand, takes <hi>Jupiter</hi> upon his ſhoulders, carries him into a remote, and obſcure Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, and (cutting out the ſinews of his Hands and Feet,) brought them away, and ſo left him miſerably mangled and maimed.

                  <p>This Fable ſeems to point at the variable fortune of Princes, and the rebellious inſurrection of Traytors in a State: For Princes may well be ſaid to be married to their Dominions, as <hi>Jupiter</hi> was to <hi>Juno;</hi> but it happens now and then, that being deboſhed by the long cuſtom of empiring, and bending towards Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, they endeavour to draw all to themſelves, and (contemning the Counſel of their Nobles and Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors) hatch Laws in their own Brain; that is, diſpoſe of things by their own fancy, and abſolute power. The people (repining at this) ſtudy how to create, and ſet up a Chief of their own choice. This Project by the ſecret inſtigation of the Peers, and Nobles, doth for

Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, having learned to be wiſe and wary, they will refrain to try the chance of Fortune by War, and yet ſtudy how to ſuppreſs the reputation of the Rebels by ſome famous Action, which if it fall out anſwerable to their expectation, the Rebels finding themſelves weakned, and fearing the ſucceſs of their broken Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; betake themſelves to ſome ſlight, and vain Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vadoes, like the hiſſing of Serpents, and at length in deſpair betake themſelves to flight; and then when

His Dignities and Offices were theſe: He was the God of Hunters, of Shepherds, and of all Rural Inhabitants: chief Preſident alſo of Hills and Mountains, and next to <hi>Mercury,</hi> the Embaſſador of the Gods. Moreover, He was accounted the Leader and Commander of the <hi>Nymphs,</hi> which were always wont to dance the rounds, and frisk about him; he was accoſted by the <hi>Satyrs</hi> and the old <hi>Sileni.</hi> He had power alſo to ſtrike Men with terrors, and thoſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially vain and ſuperſtitious, which are termed <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick fears.</hi> His acts were not many, for ought that can be found in Records, the chiefeſt was, that he challenged <hi>Cupid</hi> at wreſtling, in which conflict he had the ſoil.

                  <p>But, as touching the third conceit of <hi>Pan</hi>'s Original, it ſeems that the <hi>Graecians</hi> (either by intercourſe with the <hi>Aegyptians,</hi> or one way or other) had heard ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Myſteries; for it points to the ſtate of the World, not conſidered in immediate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but after the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> expoſed and made ſubject to Death and Corruption: For in that ſtate it was (and remains to this day) the Off-ſpring of God and Sin. And therefore all theſe Three Narrations concerning the manner of <hi>Pan</hi>'s birth may ſeem to be true, if it be rightly diſtinguiſhed between Things and Times. For this <hi>Pan</hi> or Nature (which we ſuſpect, contemplate and reverence more than is fit) took be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from the Word of God by the means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed matter, and the entrance of Prevarication and Corruption. The deſtinies may well be thought the Siſters of <hi>Pan</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> becauſe the beginnings and continuances, and corruptions and depreſſions, and diſſolutions, and eminences, and labours and felicities of things, and all the chances which can happen unto any thing, are linkt with the Chain of Cauſes natural.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Horns</hi> are attributed unto him, becauſe Horns are broad at the root and ſharp at the ends, the nature of all things being like a <hi>Pyramis,</hi> ſharp at the top. For individual or ſingular things being infinite are firſt collected into <hi>ſpecies,</hi> which are many alſo; then from <hi>ſpecies</hi> into <hi>generals,</hi> and from <hi>generals</hi> (by aſcending) are contracted into things or notions more general; ſo
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:94631:115"/>
that at length <hi>Nature</hi> may ſeem to be contracted into an unity. Neither is it to be wondred at, that <hi>Pan</hi> toucheth Heaven with his Horns, ſeeing the height of Nature or univerſal <hi>Ideas</hi> do, in ſome ſort, pertain to things Divine, and there is a ready and ſhort Paſſage from <hi>Metaphyſick</hi> to natural <hi>Theology.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Body of <hi>Nature</hi> is elegantly and with deep judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment depainted hairy, repreſenting the beams or ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of creatures; for beams are as it were the Hairs and Briſtles of <hi>Nature,</hi> and every creature is either more or leſs beamy, which is moſt apparent in the faculty of ſeeing, and no leſs in every vertue and operation that effectuates upon a diſtant Object, for whatſoever works upon any thing afar off, that may rightly be ſaid to dart forth Rays or Beams.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, <hi>Pan</hi>'s Beard is ſaid to be exceeding long, becauſe the beams or influences of Coeleſtial Bodies do operate and pierce fartheſt of all; and the Sun, when (his higher half is ſhadowed with a Cloud) his Beams break out in the lower, and looks as if he were bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nature</hi> is alſo excellently ſet forth with a biformed Body, with reſpect to the differences between ſuperior and inferior Creatures. For one part, by reaſon of their Pulcritude, and equability of motion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy and dominion over the Earth and earthly things, is worthily ſet out by the ſhape of Man: and the other part in reſpect of their perturbations and unconſtant motions, (and therefore needing to be moderated by the Coeleſtial) may be well fitted with the Figure of a Brute Beaſt. This Deſcription of his Body pertains al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the participation of <hi>Species,</hi> for no natural being ſeems to be ſimple, but as it were participated and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of two. As for example, Man hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of a Beaſt, a Beaſt ſomething of a Plant, a Plant ſomething of inanimate Body, of that all natural things are in very deed biformed, that is to ſay, compounded of a ſuperior and inferior <hi>Species.</hi>

It is a very witty Allegory, that ſame of the Feet of the Goat, by reaſon of the upward tending motion of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtrial Bodies towards the Air and Heaven, for the Goat is a climbing Creature, that loves to be hanging about the Rocks and ſteep Mountains; and this is done alſo in a wonderful manner, even by thoſe thing which are deſtinated to this inferior Globe, as may manifeſtly appear in Clouds and Meteors.</p>
                  <p>The two Enſigns which <hi>Pan</hi> bears in his hands do point, the one at Harmony, the other at Empire: For the Pipe conſiſting of ſeven Reeds, doth evidently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the conſent, and Harmony, and diſcordant concord of all inferior Creatures, which is cauſed by the Motion of the ſeven Planets: And that of the Sheep-hook may be excellently apply'd to the order of nature, which is partly right, partly crooked: This Staff therefore or Rod is ſpecially crooked in the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per end, becauſe all the works of Divine Providence in the World are done in a far fetcht and circular manner, ſo that one thing may ſeem to be affected and yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a clean contrary brought to paſs; as the ſelling of <hi>Joſeph</hi> into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and the like. Beſides in all wiſe Humane Government, they that ſit at the Helm do more happily bring their purpoſes about, and inſinuate more eaſily into the minds of the People, by pretexts and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique courſes, than by direct methods: ſo that all Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Maſſes of Authority ought in very deed to be crooked in the upper end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pan</hi>'s Cloak or Mantle is ingeniouſly feigned to be a Skin of a Leopard, becauſe it is full of Spots: So the Heavens are ſpotted with Stars, the Sea with Rocks and Iſlands, the Land with Flowers, and every particular Creature alſo is for the moſt part garniſhed with divers colours about the ſuperficies, which is as it were a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle unto it.</p>
                  <p>The Office of <hi>Pan</hi> can be by nothing ſo lively con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and expreſt, as by feigning him to be the God of Hunters, for every natural action, and ſo by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,

And yet <hi>Nature</hi> knows not how to keep a mean, but always intermixes vain and empty fears with ſuch as are diſcreet and profitable: So that all things (if their inſides might be ſeen) would appear full of <hi>Panick</hi> frights: But men eſpecially in hard, fearful, and diverſe times, are wonderfully infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated with ſuperſtition, which indeed is nothing elſe but a <hi>Panick</hi> terror.</p>

Laſtly, It is not to be wondred at, that there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing attributed unto <hi>Pan</hi> concerning Loves, but only of his marriage with <hi>Echo:</hi> For the World or Nature doth enjoy it ſelf, and in it ſelf all things elſe. Now he that loves would enjoy ſomething, but where there is enough, there is no place left to deſire. Therefore there can be no wanting love in <hi>Pan,</hi> or the World, nor deſire to obtain any thing (ſeeing he is contented with himſelf) but only Speeches, which (if plain) may be intimated by the <hi>Nymph Echo,</hi> or if more quaint by <hi>Syrinx.</hi> It is an excellent invention that <hi>Pan,</hi> or the World is ſaid to make choice of <hi>Echo</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly (above all other Speeches or Voices) for his Wife: For that alone is true Philoſophy, which doth faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully render the very words of the World; and it is written no otherwiſe than the World doth dictate, it being nothing elſe but the Image or reflection of it, not adding any thing of its own, but only iterates and reſounds. It belongs alſo to the ſufficiency or perfection of the World, that he begets no Iſſue; for the World doth generate in reſpect of its parts, but in reſpect of the whole, how can it generate, ſeeing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it there is no Body? Notwithſtanding all this, the Tale of that tatling Girl fathered upon <hi>Pan,</hi> may in very deed, with great Reaſon, be added to this Fable: For by her are repreſented thoſe vain and Idle Paradoxes concerning the Nature of things which have been frequent in all Ages, and have filled the World with Novelties; Fruitleſs, if you reſpect the matter; Changlings if you reſpect the kind, ſometimes creating Pleaſure, ſometimes tediouſneſs with their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vermuch pratling.</p>

                  <p>This Fable ſeems to direct the preparation and order, that is to be uſed in making of War; for the more apt and conſiderate undertaking whereof, three grave and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:94631:118"/>
wholeſome Precepts (ſavouring of the wiſdom of <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las)</hi> are to be obſerved.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That men do not much trouble themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Conqueſt of Neighbour Nations, ſeeing that private poſſeſſions and Empires are enlarged by diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent means: For in the augmentation of private Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues, the vicinity of mens Territories is to be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; but in the propagation of Publick Dominions, the occaſion and facility of making War, and the Fruit to be expected ought to be inſtead of vicinity. Certainly the <hi>Romans,</hi> what time their Conqueſts towards the Weſt ſcarce reacht beyond <hi>Liguria,</hi> did yet in the Eaſt bring all the Provinces as far as the Mountain <hi>Taurus</hi> within the compaſs of their Arms and Command; and therefore <hi>Perſeus,</hi> although he were bred and born in the Eaſt, did not yet refuſe to undertake an expedition even to the uttermoſt bounds of the Weſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, There muſt be a care had that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of War be juſt and honourable, for that begets an alacrity, as well in the Soldiers that fight, as in the people that pay, it draws on and procures Aids, and brings many other Commodities beſides. But there is no pretence to take up Arms more pious, than the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of Tyranny; under which yoke, the people loſe their courage, and are caſt down without heart and vigor, as in the ſight of <hi>Meduſa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thirdly, It is wiſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y added, that ſeeing there were three <hi>Gorgons</hi> (by which Wars are repreſented) <hi>Perſeus</hi> undertook her only that was mortal; that is, he made choice of ſuch a kind of War as was likely to be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected and brought to a period, not purſuing vaſt and endleſs hopes.</p>
                  <p>The furniſhing of <hi>Perſeus</hi> with neceſſaries was that which only advanced his attempt, and drew <hi>Fortune</hi> to be of his ſide; for he had ſpeed from <hi>Mercury,</hi> concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of his Counſels from <hi>Orcus,</hi> and <hi>Providence</hi> from <hi>Pallas.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="36" facs="tcp:94631:119"/>
Neither is it without an Allegory, and that full of matter too, that thoſe Wings of Celerity were faſtned to <hi>Perſeus</hi> his Heels, and not to his Ankles, to his Feet, and not to his Shoulders; becauſe ſpeed and celerity is required, not ſo much in the firſt preparations for War, as in thoſe things which ſecond and yield aid to the firſt; for there is no Error in War more frequent, than that Proſecutions and Subſidiary forces do fail to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the alacrity of the firſt onſets.</p>
                  <p>Now for that Helmet which <hi>Pluto</hi> gave him, power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to make men inviſible, the Moral is plain; but that twofold gift of Providence (to wit, the Shield and Looking Glaſs) is full of Morality; for that kind of Providence, which like a Shield avoids the force of blows, is not alone needful, but that alſo by which the ſtrength and motions, and Counſels of the Enemy are deſcryed, as in the Looking Glaſs of <hi>Pallas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Perſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>us,</hi> albeit he were ſufficiently furniſhed with aid and courage, yet was he to do one thing of ſpecial importance before he entred the Liſts with this Monſter, and that was to have ſome intelligence with the <hi>Greae.</hi> Theſe <hi>Greae</hi> are Treaſons which may be termed the Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of War not deſcended of the ſame ſtock, but far unlike in Nobility of Birth; for Wars are generous and heroical, but Treaſons are baſe and ignoble. Their deſcription is elegant, for they are ſaid to be Gray-hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and like old Women from their Birth; by reaſon that Traytors are continually vext with cares and tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidations. But all their ſtrength (before they break out into open Rebellions) conſiſts either in an Eye or in a Tooth; for every faction alienated from any State, contemplates and bites. Beſides, this Eye and Tooth is as it were common; for whatſoever they can learn and know, is delivered and carried from one to another by the hands of Faction. And as concerning the Tooth, they do all bite alike, and ſing the ſame ſong; ſo that hear one, and you hear all. <hi>Perſeus</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was to deal with theſe <hi>Greae</hi> for the love of their
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:94631:119"/>
Eye and Tooth. Their Eye to diſcover, their Tooth to ſow rumors and ſtir up envy, and to moleſt and trouble the Minds of men. Theſe things therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus diſpoſed and prepared, he addreſſes himſelf to the Action of War, and ſets upon <hi>Meduſa</hi> as ſhe ſlept; for a wiſe Captain will ever aſſault his Enemy, when he is unprepared and moſt ſecure; and then is there good uſe of <hi>Pallas</hi> her Glaſs: For moſt men, before it come to the puſh, can acutely pry into and diſcern their Enemies eſtate; but the beſt uſe of this Glaſs is in the very point of danger, that the manner of it may be ſo conſidered, as that the terror may not diſcourage, which is ſignified by that looking into this Glaſs with the face turned from <hi>Meduſa.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Monſter's Head being cut off, there follow two effects. The firſt was, the procreation and raiſing of <hi>Pegaſus,</hi> by which may be evidently underſtood <hi>Fame,</hi> that (flying thorough the World) proclaims Victory. The ſecond is the bearing of <hi>Meduſa</hi>'s Head in his Shield; to which there is no kind of defence for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency comparable; for the one famous and memorable act proſperouſly effected and brought to paſs, doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the Motions and Inſolencies of Enemies, and makes Envy her ſelf ſilent and amazed.</p>

                  <p>This Fable may have reference to the nature and diſpoſitions of Princes; for they being full of doubts, and prone to jealouſie, do not eaſily acquaint Men of prying and curious Eyes, and as it were of vigilant and wakeful diſpoſitions, with the ſecret humours and manners of their life; but ſuch rather as are of quiet and obſervant Natures, ſuffering them to do what they liſt without further ſcanting, making as if they were ignorant, and perceiving nothing but of a ſtupid diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and poſſeſt with ſleep, yielding unto them ſimple obedience, rather than ſlie complements; For it pleaſeth Princes now and then to deſcend from their Thrones or Majeſty (like <hi>Luna</hi> from the ſuperior Orb) and laying aſide their Robes of Dignity (which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to be cumbred with, would ſeem a kind of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then) familiarly to converſe with Men of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, which they think may be done without dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; a quality chiefly noted in <hi>Tiberius Caeſar,</hi> who (of all others) was a Prince moſt ſevere; yet ſuch only were gracious in his favour, as being well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with his diſpoſition, did yet conſtantly diſſemble, as if they knew nothing.

For whoſe cruel Death the River <hi>Helicon</hi> (ſacred to the Muſes) in horrible in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, hid his Head under ground, and raiſed it again in another place.</p>
                  <p>The meaning of this Fable ſeems to be thus: <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheus</hi>'s Muſick is of two ſorts, the one appeaſing the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fernal Powers, the other attracting Beaſts and Trees, The firſt may be fitly applied to Natural Philoſophy, the ſecond to Moral or Civil Diſcipline.</p>
                  <p>The moſt noble work of Natural Philoſophy, is the Reſtitution and Renovation of things corruptible; the other (as a leſſer degree of it) the Preſervation of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in their Eſtates, detaining them from diſſolution and putrefaction; and if this gift may be in Mortals, certainly it can be done by no other means than by the due and exquiſite temper of Nature, as by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody and delicate touch of an Inſtrument. But ſeeing it is of all things moſt difficult, it is ſeldom or never attained unto; and in all likelihood for no other reaſon, more than through curious diligence and untimely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience. And therefore Philoſophy hardly able to produce ſo excellent an effect in a penſive humour, (and that without cauſe) buſies her ſelf about Humane Objects, and by Perſuaſion and Eloquence, inſinuating the love of Vertue, Equity, and Concord in the minds of Men; draws multitudes of People to a Society, makes them ſubjects to Laws, obedient to Government, and forgetful of their unbridled Affections, whil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

were called together and ſetled in order. And after ſerious trial made and fruſtrated about the reſtoring of a body mortal; this care of Civil affairs follows in his due place: becauſe by a plain demonſtration of the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitable neceſſity of death, Mens minds are moved to ſeek Eternity by the fame and glory of their Merits. It is alſo wiſely ſaid in the Fable, that <hi>Orpheus</hi> was averſe from the love of Women and Marriage, becauſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights of Wedlock and the love of Children do for the moſt part hinder Men from enterpriſing great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſigns for the publick good, holding Poſterity a ſufficient ſtep to Immortality without Actions.</p>
                  <p>Beſides even the very works of Wiſdom (although amongſt all Humane things they do moſt excel) do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs meet with their periods. For it happens that (after Kingdoms and Commonwealths have flouriſhed for a time) even Tumults, and Seditions, and Wars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe; in the mid'ſt of which hurly-burlies, firſt Laws are ſilent, Men return to the pravity of their Natures; Fields and Towns are waſted and depopulated; and then (if their fury continue) Learning and Philoſophy muſt needs be diſ-membred; ſo that a few Fragments only, and in ſome places will be found like the ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Boards of Shipwrack, ſo as a barbarous Age muſt follow; and the Streams of <hi>Hellicon</hi> being hid under the Earth, (untill the Viciſſitude of things paſſing,) they break out again, and appear in ſome other remote Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, though not perhaps in the ſame Climate.</p>

                  <p>This Fable ſeems enigmatically to ſhew from whence all things took their beginning, not much differing from that Opinion of Philoſophers, which <hi>Democritus</hi> afterwards laboured to maintain, attributing Eternity to the firſt Matter, and not to the World. In which he comes ſomewhat near the truth of Divine Writ, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us of a huge deformed Maſs, before the beginning of the ſix days Work.</p>
                  <p>The meaning of the Fable is this: By <hi>Coelum</hi> may be underſtood that vaſt concavity, or vaulted compaſs that comprehends all Matter: and by <hi>Saturn</hi> may be meant the matter it ſelf, which takes from his Parent all power of generating; for the univerſality or whole Bulk of Matter always remains the ſame, neither in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing or diminiſhing in reſpect of the quality of its Nature: But by the Divers agitations and motions of it, were firſt produced imperfect, and ill agreeing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of things, making as it were certain Worlds for Proofs or Eſſays, and ſo in proceſs of time a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Fabrick or Structure was framed, which ſhould ſtill retain and keep his form. And therefore the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the firſt Age was ſhadowed by the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Saturn,</hi> who for the frequent diſſolutions and ſhort continuances of things was aptly feigned to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour his Children. The ſucceeding Government was decyphered by the Reign of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> who confined
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:94631:124"/>
thoſe continual Mutations unto <hi>Tartarus,</hi> a place ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying Perturbation. This place ſeems to be all that middle place between the lower ſuperficies of Heaven; and the Centre of the Earth: in which all perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and fragility, and mortality or corruption are frequent. During the former Generation of things in the time of <hi>Saturn</hi>'s Reign, <hi>Venus</hi> was not born: for ſo long as in the univerſality of Matter, Diſcord was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more prevalent than Concord, it was neceſſary that there ſhould be total diſſolution or mutation, and that in the whole Fabrick. And by this kind of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration were Creatures produced before <hi>Saturn</hi> was deprived of his Genitals. When this ceaſed, that other which wrought by <hi>Venus,</hi> immediately came in, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting in ſetled and prevalent concord of things, ſo that Mutation ſhould be only in reſpect of the parts, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Fabrick remaining whole and inviolate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Saturn,</hi> they ſay, was depoſed and caſt down into Hell, but not deſtroyed and utterly extinguiſht, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was an Opinion that the World ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe into the old <hi>Chaos</hi> and <hi>interregnum</hi> again, which <hi>Lucretius</hi> prayed might not happen in his time:</p>

                  <p>For afterwards the World ſhould ſubſiſt by its own quantity and power. Yet from the beginning there was no reſt: for in the Celeſtial Regions there firſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed notable Mutations, which by the power of the <hi>Sun</hi> (predominating over ſuperiour Bodies) were ſo quieted, that the ſtate of the World ſhould be conſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: and afterwards (in inferior Bodies) by the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing

and diſſipating of Inundations, Tempeſts, Winds, and general Earthquakes, a more peaceable durable Agreement and Tranquility of things followed.

                  <p>THE Poets ſay that <hi>Proteus</hi> was <hi>Neptune</hi>'s Herds-man, a grave Sire, and ſo excellent a Prophet, that he might well be termed thrice excellent: for he knew not only things to come, but even things paſt as well as preſent; ſo that beſides his skill in Divination, he was the Meſſenger and Interpreter of all Antiquities and hidden Myſteries. The place of his abode was a huge vaſt Cave, where his Cuſtom was every day at noon to count his Flock of Sea-calves, and then to go to ſleep. Moreover he that deſired his advice in any thing, could by no other means obtain it, but by catching him in Manacles, and holding him faſt therewith; who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs to be at liberty would turn himſelf into all manner of Forms and Wonders of Nature; ſometimes into Fire, ſometimes into Water, ſometimes into the ſhape of Beaſts, and the like; till at length he were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his own Form again.</p>

                  <p>Now this is ſaid to be done, not in the morning, nor in the evening, but at noon; to wit, at ſuch time as is moſt fit and convenient for the perfecting and bringing forth of <hi>Species</hi> out of Matter, duly prepared and prediſpoſed, and in the middle, as it were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their beginning and declinations, which we know ſufficiently (out of the Holy Hiſtory) to be done about the time of the Creation: for then by the power of that Divine Word <hi>(Producat.) Matter</hi> at the Creator's command did congregate it ſelf (not by ambages or turnings, but inſtantly) to the production of its work into an Act and Conſtitution of <hi>Species.</hi> And thus far have we the Narration of <hi>Proteus,</hi> (free and unreſtrained,) together with his Flock compleat: for the univerſality of things, with their ordinary Structures and Compoſitions of <hi>Species,</hi> bears the face of matter, not limited and conſtrained, and of the Flock alſo of material beings. Nevertheleſs if any expert Miniſter of Nature, ſhall encounter Matter by main force, vexing and urging her with intent and purpoſe to reduce her to nothing; ſhe contrariwiſe (ſeeing annihilation and abſolute deſtruction cannot be effected by the Omnipotency of God) being thus caught in the ſtraits of neceſſity, doth change and turn her ſelf into divers ſtrange Forms and Shapes of things, ſo that at length (by fetching a circuit as it were) ſhe comes to a period, and (if the force con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue) betakes her ſelf to her former being.

The <hi>Greek</hi> Philoſophers are obſerved to be very acute and diligent in ſearching out the material Principles of things; but in the beginnings of motion (wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts all the efficacy of operation,) they are negligent and weak, and in this that we handle, they ſeem to be altogether blind, and ſtammering; for the Opinion of the <hi>Peripatericks</hi> concerning the appetite of Matter, cauſed by privation, is in a manner nothing elſe but Words, which rather ſound, than ſignifie any Reality. And thoſe that refer it unto God, do very well; but then they leap up, they aſcend not by degrees; for doubtleſs there is one chief Law ſubordinate to God, in which all natural things concur and meet, the ſame that in the fore-cited Scripture is demonſtrated in theſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:94631:128"/>
Words, <hi>Opus quod operatus eſt Deus à principio uſque ad fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem;</hi> the Work that God hath wrought from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning even to the end. But <hi>Democritus,</hi> which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred more deeply into the conſideration of this point, after he had conceived an <hi>Atom,</hi> with ſome ſmall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion and form, he attributed unto it one only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or firſt motion, ſimply, or abſolutely, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther comparatively, or in reſpect; for he thought that all things did properly tend to the Centre of the World, whereof thoſe Bodies which were more material, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend with ſwifter motion, and thoſe that had leſs Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, did, on the contrary, tend upward. But this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation was very ſhallow, containing leſs than was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient; for neither the turning of the Celeſtial Bodies in a round, nor ſhutting and opening of things, may ſeem to be reduced or applied to this beginning. And as for that opinion of <hi>Epicurus,</hi> concerning the caſual declination and agitation of the <hi>Atom,</hi> it is but a mere Toy, and a plain evidence, that he was ignorant of that Point. It is therefore more apparent (than we could wiſh,) that this <hi>Cupid,</hi> or Love, remains as yet clou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded under the ſhades of <hi>Night.</hi> Now as concerning his Attributes; He is elegantly deſcribed with perpetual Infancy, or Childhood; becauſe compound Bodies they ſeem greater, and more ſtricken in years: Whereas the firſt Seeds of things, or <hi>Atoms,</hi> they are little, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minute, and alſo in their Infancy.</p>
                  <p>He is alſo well feigned to be naked, becauſe all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound Bodies, to a Man rightly judging, ſeem to be apparelled and cloathed, and nothing to be properly naked but the firſt Particles of things.</p>
                  <p>Concerning his Blindneſs, the Allegory is full of Wiſdom; for this <hi>Love,</hi> or Deſire (whatſoever it be) ſeems to have but little Providence, as directing his pace and motion by that which it perceives neareſt; not unlike blind men that go by feeling: More admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble then, muſt that chief divine Providence, be, which (from things empty and deſtitute of Providence, and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:94631:128"/>
as it were, blind,) by a conſtant and fatal Law, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth ſo excellent an Order and Beauty of Things.</p>
                  <p>The laſt Thing which is attributed to <hi>Love,</hi> is <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery;</hi> by which is meant, that his Virtue is ſuch, as that it works upon a diſtant Object; becauſe that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever operates afar off, ſeems to ſhoot, as it were, an Arrow. Wherefore whoſoever holds the Being both of <hi>Atoms</hi> and <hi>Vacuity,</hi> muſt needs infer, that the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the <hi>Atom</hi> reacheth to a diſtant Object; for if it were not ſo, there could be no motion at all, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the interpoſition of <hi>Vacuity;</hi> but all things would ſtand ſtone ſtill, and remain immoveable.</p>
                  <p>Now as touching that other <hi>Cupid</hi> or <hi>Love,</hi> he may well be termed the youngeſt of the Gods, becauſe he could have no being before the conſtitution of <hi>Species.</hi> And in his deſcription the Allegory may be applied and traduced to manners: Nevertheleſs he holds ſome kind of conformity with the Elder; for <hi>Venus</hi> doth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſtir up a deſire of Conjunction and Procreati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and <hi>Cupid</hi> her Son doth apply this deſire to ſome individual Nature; ſo that the general diſpoſition comes from <hi>Venus,</hi> the more exact ſympathy from <hi>Cupid:</hi> the one derived from Cauſes more near, the other from Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings more remote and fatal, and as it were from the elder <hi>Cupid,</hi> of whom every exquiſite ſympathy doth depend.</p>

But upon the very firſt Calamity that hapned unto this Nation whereunto he was fled for Succour, King <hi>Daunus</hi> enters into a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit with himſelf that he had entertained a wicked Gueſt into his Family, and a Man odious to the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, and an Impugner of their Divinity, that had da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, with his Sword, to aſſault and wound that God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs, who, in their Religion, they held it Sacrilege ſo much as to touch. Therefore, that he might expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate his Countrey's Guilt, (nothing reſpecting the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Hoſpitality, when the Bonds of Religion tied him with a more reverend regard) ſuddenly ſlew <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes,</hi> commanding withal that his Trophies and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues ſhould be aboliſhed and deſtroyed. Neither was it ſafe to lament this miſerable Deſtiny; but even his Companions in Arms, whilſt they mourned at the Funeral of their Captain, and filled all the places with Plaints and Lamentations, were ſuddenly metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſed into Birds like unto Swans, who, when their Death approacheth, ſing melodious and mournful Hymns.</p>
                  <p>This Fable hath a moſt rare and ſingular Subject: For in any of the Poetical Records, wherein the <hi>Heroes</hi> are mentioned, we find not that any one of them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Diomedes,</hi> did ever with his Sword offer Violence to any of the <hi>Deities.</hi> And indeed, the Fable ſeems in him to repreſent the nature and fortune of Man, who of himſelf, doth propound, and make this as the end of all his Actions, to worſhip ſome Divine Power, or to follow ſome Sect of Religion, though never ſo vain and ſuperſtitious, and with Force and Arms to defend
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:94631:129"/>
the ſame: For although thoſe bloody Quarrels for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion were unknown to Ancients, (the Heathen Gods not having ſo much as a touch of that Jealouſie, which is an Attribute of the true God,) yet the Wiſdom of the Antient Times ſeems to be ſo copious and full, as that, what was not known by Experience, was yet compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended by Meditations and Fictions. They then that endeavour to reform and convince any Sect of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (though vain, corrupt, and infamous, ſhadowed by the Perſon of <hi>Venus,)</hi> not by the force of Argument and Doctrine, and Holineſs of Life, and by the weight of Examples and Authority, but labour to extirpate and root it out by Fire and Sword, and Tortures, are encouraged, it may be, thereunto by <hi>Pallas;</hi> that is, by the Acrity of <hi>Prudence,</hi> and Severity of Judgment, by whoſe Vigour and Efficacy, they ſee into the Falſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Vanity of theſe Errors. And by this their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of Pravity, and good zeal to Religion, they pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe to themſelves great Glory, and by the Vulgar (to whom nothing moderate can be grateful) are eſteemed and honoured as the only Supporters of Truth and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when others ſeem to be luke-warm and full of Fear. Yet this Glory and Happineſs doth ſeldom en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to the end, ſeeing every violent-Proſperity, if it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent not alteration by an untimely Death grows to be unproſperous at laſt: For if it happen that by a change of Government, this baniſhed and depreſſed Sect get ſtrength, and ſo bear up again, then theſe zealous Men, ſo fierce in oppoſition before, are condemned, their ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Names are hateful, and all their Glory ends in Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy.</p>
                  <p>In that <hi>Diomedes</hi> is ſaid to be murthered by his Hoſt, it gives us to underſtand that the difference of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on breeds Deceit and Treachery, even among neareſt Acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>Now in that Lamentation and Mourning was not tolerated but puniſhed; it puts us in mind, that let there be never ſo nefarious an Act done, yet there is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:94631:130"/>
ſome place left for Commiſeration and Pity, that even thoſe that hate Offences, ſhould yet in Humanity commiſerate Offenders, and Pity their diſtreſs, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Extremity of Evil when Mercy is not ſuffered to have commerce with Miſery.

                  <p>MEchanical Wiſdom and Induſtry, and in it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Science perverted to wrong ends, is ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed by the Ancients under the Perſon of <hi>Daedalus,</hi> a Man ingenious, but execrable. This <hi>Daedalus</hi> (for murthering his fellow-ſervant that emulated him) being baniſhed, was kindly entertained (during his Exile) in many Cities and Princes Courts: For indeed he was the Raiſer and Builder of many goodly Structures, as well in honour of the Gods, as the Beauty and Magnificence of Cities, and other publick places, but for his Works of Miſchief he is moſt notorious. It is he that framed the Engine which <hi>Paſiphae</hi> uſed to ſatisfie her Luſt in company with a Bull; ſo that by his wretched Induſtry, and pernicious Device, that Monſter <hi>Minotaur</hi> (the deſtruction of ſo many hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Youths) took his accurſed and infamous begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſtudying to cover and increaſe one Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:94631:130"/>
with another; for the ſecurity and preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Monſter he invented and built a Labyrinth, a Work for intent and uſe moſt nefarious and wicked, for Skill and Workmanſhip famous and excellent. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, that he might not be noted only for Works of Miſchief, but be ſought after as well for Remedies, as for Inſtruments of Deſtruction, he was the Author of that ingenious device concerning the Clew of Thread, by which the Labyrinth was made paſſable without any let. This <hi>Daedalus</hi> was perſecuted by <hi>Minos</hi> with great Severity, Diligence, and Inquiry, but he always found the means to avoid and eſcape his Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny. Laſtly, he taught his Son <hi>Icarus</hi> to fly; but the Novice, in Oſtentation of this Art, ſoaring too high, fell into the Sea and was drowned.</p>
                  <p>The Parable ſeems to be thus: In the beginning of it may be noted that kind of Envy or Emulation that lodgeth, and wonderfully ſways and domineers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt excellent Artificers, there being no kind of People more reciprocally tormented with bitter and deadly Hatred than they.</p>
                  <p>The Baniſhment alſo of <hi>Daedalus</hi> (a puniſhment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlicted on him againſt the Rules of Policy and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) is worth the noting: For Artificers have this Prerogative to find entertainment and welcome in all Countries, ſo that Exile to an excellent Workman can hardly be termed a puniſhment, whereas other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions and States of Life can ſcarce live out of their own Countrey. The admiration of Artificers is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated and increaſed in foreign and ſtrange Nations, ſeeing it is a natural and unbred diſpoſition of Men to value their own Countrey-men (in reſpect of Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Works) leſs than Strangers.</p>
                  <p>Concerning the uſe of Mechanical Arts, that which follows is plain. The Life of Man is much beholden to them, ſeeing many Things (conducing to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="60" facs="tcp:94631:131"/>
out of their Treaſuries: And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding from the ſame <hi>Magazine</hi> or Store-houſe are produced Inſtruments both of Luſt and Death; for to omit the Wiles of Bands, we will know how far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Poyſons, Warlike Engines, and ſuch like Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs (the effects of Mechanical Inventions) do exceed the <hi>Minotaur</hi> himſelf in Malignity and ſavage Cruelty.</p>
                  <p>Moreover that of the <hi>Labyrinth</hi> is an excellent Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory, whereby is ſhadowed the nature of Mechanical Sciences; for all ſuch handicraft Works as are more ingenious and accurate, may be compared to a Laby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth in reſpect of Subtilty and divers intricate Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and in other plain reſemblances, which by the Eye of Judgment can hardly be guided and diſcerned, but only by the Line of Experience.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it impertinently added, that he which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the intricate Nooks of the Labyrinth, did alſo ſhew the Commodity of the Clew: For Mechanical Arts are of ambiguous uſe, ſerving as well for hurt as for Remedy, and they have in a manner Power both to looſe and bind themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Unlawful Trades, and ſo by conſequence, Arts them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are often perſecuted by <hi>Minos,</hi> that is by Laws, which do condemn them, and prohibit Men to uſe them. Nevertheleſs they are hid and retained every where, finding lurking holes and places of Receipt, which was well obſerved by <hi>Tacitus</hi> of the Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians and Figure-flingers of his time, in a thing not ſo much unlike; <hi>Genus Hominum quod in Civitate noſtra ſemper &amp; retinebitur &amp; vetabitur.</hi> There is a kind of Men that will always abide in our City, though al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways forbidden. And yet notwithſtanding unlawful and curious Arts of what kind ſoever, in tract of time, when they cannot perform what they promiſe, do fall from the good Opinion that was held of them, (no otherwiſe than <hi>Icarus</hi> fell down from the Skies,) they grow to be contemned and ſcorned, and ſo pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by too much Oſtentation.

they are not ſo happily ſtrairened by the Reins of Law, as bewrayed by their own Vanity.</p>

                  <p>There is ſuch excellent morality coucht in this Fable, as that Moral Philoſophy affords not better; for under the Perſon of <hi>Bacchus</hi> is deſcribed the nature of Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Paſſion, or Perturbation, the Mother of which (though never ſo hurtful) is nothing elſe but the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:94631:135"/>
of apparent good in the Eyes of Appetite. And it is always conceived in an unlawful deſire, raſhly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded and obtained, before well underſtood and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; and when it begins to grow, the Mother of it, which is the deſire of apparent good by too much ſervency, is deſtroyed and periſheth. Nevertheleſs whil'ſt yet it is an imperfect <hi>Embrio)</hi> it is nouriſhed and preſerved in the Humane Soul, (which is as it were a Father unto it, and repreſented by <hi>Jupiter,)</hi> but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the inferior part thereof, as in a Thigh, where alſo it cauſeth ſo much trouble and vexation, as that good determinations and actions are much hindred and lamed thereby; and when it comes to be confirmed by conſent and habit, and breaks out as it were into act, it remains yet a while with <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> as with a Nurſe, that is, it ſeeks corners and ſecret places, and as it were, Caves under Ground, until (the Reigns of Shame and Fear being laid aſide in a pampered audaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs) it either takes the pretext of ſome Vertue, or becomes altogether impudent and ſhameleſs. And it is moſt true, that every vehement Paſſion is of a doubtfull Sex, as being Maſculine in the firſt Motion, but Femi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine in Proſecution.</p>
                  <p>It is an excellent Fiction that of <hi>Bacchus</hi> his revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; for Paſſions do ſometimes ſeem to be in a dead ſleep, and as it were utterly extinct, but we ſhould not think them to be ſo indeed, no, though they lay, as it were, in their Grave; for let there be but matter and opportunity offered, and you ſhall ſee them quickly to revive again.</p>
                  <p>The invention of Wine is wittily aſcribed unto him; every affection being ingenious and skilful in finding out that which brings nouriſhment unto it; and indeed, of all things known to Men, Wine is moſt powerful and efficacious to excite and kindle Paſſions of what kind ſoever, as being in a manner common Nurſe to themall.</p>

Again, his conquering of Nations, and undertaking infinite Expeditions is an elegant device; for Deſire never reſts content with what it hath, but with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and unſatiable Appetite ſtill covets and gapes af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter more.</p>
                  <p>His Chariot alſo is well ſaid to be drawn by Tygers; for as ſoon as any affection ſhall from going a foot, be advanced to ride in a Chariot, and ſhall captivate rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and lead her in a triumph, it grows cruel, unta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and fierce againſt whatſoever withſtands or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth it.</p>
                  <p>It is worth the noting alſo, that thoſe ridiculous Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goblins are brought in dancing about his Chariot; for every Paſſion doth cauſe, in the Eyes, Face and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, certain undecent, and ill-ſeeming, apiſh, and deformed motions; ſo that they who in any kind of Paſſion, as in anger, arrogancy, or love, ſeem glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and brave in their own Eyes, do yet appear to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers miſſhapen and ridiculous.</p>
                  <p>In that the Muſes are ſaid to be of his company, it ſhews that there is no affection almoſt which is not ſoothed by ſome Art, wherein the indulgence of Wits doth derogate from the glory of the Muſes, who (when they ought to be the Miſtreſs of Life) are made the Waiting-maids, of affections.</p>
                  <p>Again, where <hi>Bacchus</hi> is ſaid to have loved <hi>Ariadne,</hi> that was rejected by <hi>Theſeus;</hi> it is an Allegory of ſpecial obſervation; for it is moſt certain, that Paſſions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways covet and deſire that which Experience forſakes; and they all know (who have paid dear for ſerving and obeying their Luſt) that whether it be honour, or riches, or delight, or glory, or knowledge, or any thing elſe which they ſeek after, yet are they but things caſt off, and by divers Men, in all ages after experience had utterly rejected and loathed.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it without a Myſtery, that the <hi>Ivy</hi> was ſacred to <hi>Bacchus;</hi> for the Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now, in that this Gift is ſaid to paſs from Men to Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents, it may ſeem to be added to the Fable for orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-ſake in a manner, unleſs it were inſerted to ſhame Men, that having the uſe of that Coeleſtial Fire, and of ſo many Arts, are not able to get unto themſelves ſuch things as Nature it ſelf beſtows upon many other Creatures.</p>
                  <p>But that ſudden reconciliation of Men to <hi>Prometheus,</hi> after they were fruſtrated of their hopes, contains a profitable and wiſe Note, ſhewing the levity and temerity of Men in new Experiments; for if they have not preſent Succeſs, anſwerable to their expectation, with too ſudden haſt deſiſt from that they began, and with precipitancy returning to their former experiments, are reconciled to them again.</p>
                  <p>The ſtate of Man, in reſpect of Arts, and ſuch things as concern the Intellect, being now deſcribed, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable paſſeth to Religion: For after the planting of Arts, follows the ſetting of Divine Principles, which Hypocriſie hath over-ſpread and polluted. By that two-fold Sacrifice therefore is elegantly ſhadowed out the Perſons of a true Religious Man, and an Hypocrite. In the one is contained Fatneſs, which (by reaſon of the Inflammation and Fumes thereof,) is called, <hi>The Portion of God;</hi> by which his Affection and Zeal, (tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Gods Glory, and aſcending towards Heaven) is ſignified. In him alſo are contained the Bowels of Charity, and in him is found that good and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Fleſh. Whereas in the other, there is nothing
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:94631:141"/>
but dry and naked Bones; which nevertheleſs, do ſtuff up the Hide, and make it appear like a fair and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrifice: By this may be well meant thoſe exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and vain Rites, and empty Ceremonies by which Men do oppreſs and fill up the ſincere Worſhip of God, things compoſed rather for oſtentation, than any way conducing to true Piety. Neither do they hold it ſufficient to offer ſuch mock-Sacrifices unto God, except they alſo lay them before him, as if he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen and beſpoke them. Certainly the Prophet in the perſon of God, doth thus expoſtulate concerning this Choice, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. 5. <hi>Num tandem hoc eſt illud Jejunium quod ELEGI, ut homo animam ſuam in diem unum affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat, &amp; caput inſtar junceti demittat?</hi> Is it ſuch a Faſt, that I have choſen, that a Man ſhould afflict his Soul for a day, and to bow down his head like a Bulruſh?</p>
                  <p>Having now touch'd the State of Religion, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable converts it ſelf to the Manners and Conditions of humane Life. And it is a common, but apt inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation, by <hi>Pandora</hi> to be meant pleaſure and volup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuouſneſs; which (when the civil Life is pamperd with too much Art, and Culture, and Superfluity,) is ingendred, as it were, by the efficacy of Fire, and therefore the work of Voluptuouſneſs is attributed unto <hi>Vulcan,</hi> who alſo himſelf doth repreſent Fire. From this do infinite Miſeries, together with too late repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, proceed, and overflow the Minds, and Bodies, and Fortunes of Men, and that not only in reſpect of particular Eſtates, but even over Kingdoms and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths; for from this Fountain have Wars, Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults, and Tyrannies derived their Original.</p>
                  <p>But it would be worth the Labour to conſider how elegantly and proportionably this Fable doth delineate two Conditions; or (as I may ſay) two Tables or Examples of humane Life, under the Perſons of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus,</hi> or <hi>Epimetheus;</hi> for they that are of <hi>Epimetheus</hi> his Sect, are improvident, not foreſeeing what may come to paſs hereafter; eſteeming that beſt which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:94631:141"/>
ſeems moſt ſweet for the preſent; whence it happens, that they are overtaken with many miſeries, difficulties, and calamities, and ſo lead their Lives almoſt in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual affliction; but yet notwithſtanding they pleaſe their Fancy, and out of ignorance of the paſſages of things, do entertain many vain hopes in their mind, whereby they ſometimes (as with ſweet Dreams) ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace themſelves, and ſweeten the Miſeries of their Life. But they that are <hi>Prometheus</hi> his Scholars, are Men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with Prudence, foreſeeing things to come, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily ſhunning, and avoiding many Evils and Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. But to theſe their good Properties, they have alſo annexed, that they deprive themſelves, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraud their <hi>Genius</hi> of many lawful Pleaſures, and divers Recreations, and (which is worſe,) they vex, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment themſelves with cares and troubles, and inteſtine fears; for being chained to the Pillar of Neceſſity, they are afflicted with innumerable cogitations, (which, becauſe they are very ſwift, may be fitly, compared to an Eagle,) and thoſe griping, and as it were, gnaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and devouring the Liver, unleſs ſometimes, as it were, by Night, it may be they get a little recreation, and eaſe of Mind; but ſo, as that they are again ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly aſſaulted with freſh anxieties and fears.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this Benefit happens to but a very few of either condition, that they ſhould retain the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities of Providence, and free themſelves from the Miſeries of Care and Perturbation; neither indeed can any attain unto it, but by the aſſiſtance of <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules,</hi> that is, Fortitude, and Conſtancy of Mind, which is prepared for every Event and armed in all Fortunes, foreſeeing without fear, enjoying without loathing, and ſuffering without Impatience. It is worth the noting alſo, that this Vertue was not natural to <hi>Prometheus,</hi> but adventitial, and from the indulgence of another; for no in-bred and natural Fortitude is able to encounter with theſe Miſeries. Moreover, this Vertue was received and brought unto him from the

remoteſt part of the <hi>Ocean,</hi> and from the <hi>Sun,</hi> that is, from Wiſdom, as from the Sun; and from the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Inconſtancy, or of the Waters of humane Life, as from the ſailing upon the Ocean; which two <hi>Virgil</hi> hath well conjoyned in theſe Verſes;</p>

                  </q>
                  <p>Moreover, it is elegantly added for the conſolation and confirmation of Men's Minds, that this noble <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro</hi> croſs'd the Ocean in a Cup or Pan, leſt peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they might too much fear that the ſtraits and frailty of their Nature will not be capable of this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and Conſtancy. Of which very thing <hi>Seneca</hi> well conceived, when he ſaid, <hi>Magnum eſt habere ſimul fragilitatem hominis, &amp; ſecuritatem Dei.</hi> It is a great matter for Humane Frailty and Divine Security to be one and the ſelf-ſame time, in one and the ſelf-ſame Subject.</p>
                  <p>But now we are to ſtep back a little again to that, which by premeditation paſt over, leſt a Breach ſhould be made in thoſe things that were ſo link'd together. That therefore which I could touch here, is that laſt Crime imputed to <hi>Prometheus,</hi> about ſeeking to bereave <hi>Minerva</hi> of her Virginity: For queſtionleſs, it was this hainous offence that brought that puniſhment of devouring his Liver, upon him; which is nothing elſe but to ſhew, that when we are puft up with too much Learning and Science, they go about oftentimes to make even Divine Oracles ſubject to Sence and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; whence moſt certainly follows a continual di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:94631:142"/>
and reſtleſs griping of the Mind; we muſtthere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore with a ſober, and humble Judgment, diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Humanity, and Divinity, and between the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Senſe, and the Myſteries of Faith unleſs an Heretical Religion, and a commentitious Philoſophy be pleaſing unto us.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, it remains that we ſay ſomething of the Games of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> performed with burning Torches, which again hath reference to Arts and Sciences, as that fire, in whoſe Memory, and Celebration, theſe Games were inſtituted, and it contains in it a moſt wiſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition, that the perfection of Sciences to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from Succeſſion, not from the nimbleneſs and promptneſs of one only Author; for they that are nimbleſt in Courſe, and ſtrongeſt in Contention, yet happily have not the luck to keep Fire ſtill in their Torch; ſeeing it may be as well extinguiſhed by run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning too faſt, as by going to ſlow. And this run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and contending with Lamps, ſeems long ſince to be intermitted, ſeeing all Sciences ſeem even now to flouriſh moſt in their firſt Authors, <hi>Ariſtotle, Galen, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clid,</hi> and <hi>Ptolomy;</hi> Succeſſion having neither effected, nor almoſt attempted any great Matter. It were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be wiſhed, that theſe Games, in honour of <hi>Prometheus,</hi> or Humane Nature, were again reſtored, and that Matters ſhould receive ſucceſs by Combate and Emulation, and not hang upon any one Man'sſparkling and ſhaking Torch. Men therefore are to be admoniſhed to rouſe up their Spirits, and try their ſtrengths and turns, and not refer all to the Opinions and Brains of a few.</p>
                  <p>And thus have I delivered that which I thought good to obſerve out of this ſo well known, and common Fable; and yet I will not deny, but that there may be ſome things in it, which have an admirable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent with the Myſteries of Chriſtian Religion, and eſpecially that Sailing of <hi>Hercules</hi> in a Cup, (to ſet <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metheus</hi> at liberty,) ſeems to repreſent an Image of the Divine Word, coming in Fleſh, as in a frail Veſſel, to

                  <p>This Fable contains in it no leſs wiſdom than ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancy, and it ſeems to point at Science, eſpecially that which is joyned with practice, for Science may not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdly be termed a Monſter, as being by the ignorant and rude multitude always held in admiration. It is diverſe in ſhape and figure, by reaſon of the infinite variety of Subjects, wherein it is converſant. A mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Face and Voice is attributed unto it for its gracious countenance and volubility of Tongue. Wings are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, becauſe Sciences and their Inventions do paſs and fly from one to another, as it were, in a moment, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the communication of Science is as the kindling of one light at another. Elegantly alſo it is feigned to have ſharp and hooked Talons, becauſe the Axioms and Arguments of Science do ſo faſten upon the mind, and ſo ſtrongly apprehended and hold it, as that it ſtir

                  <p>Moreover, all Science ſeems to be placed in ſteep and high Mountains; as being thought to be a lofty and high thing, looking down upon ignorance with a ſcornful Eye. It may be obſerved and ſeen alſo a great way, and far in compaſs, as things ſet on the tops of Mountains.</p>
                  <p>Furthermore, Science may well be feigned to beſet the High-way, becauſe which way ſoever we turn in this Progreſs and Pilgrimage of Humane Life, we meet with ſome matter or occaſion offered for Contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                     <hi>Sphynx</hi> is ſaid to have received from the Muſes, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers difficult Queſtions and Riddles, and to propound them unto Men, which remaining with the Muſes, are free (it may be) from ſavage cruelty; for ſo long as there is no other end of Study and Meditation, than to know, the Underſtanding is not racked and impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, but enjoys Freedom and Liberty, and even doubts and variety, find a kind of pleaſure and delectation: But when once theſe <hi>Aenigma's</hi> are delivered by the Muſes to <hi>Sphynx,</hi> that is, to practice, ſo that if it be ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited and urged by Action, and Election, and Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination; then they begin to be troubleſome and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging; and unleſs they be reſolved and expedited, they do wonderfully torment and vex the minds of Men, diſtracting, and in a manner rendrng them into ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry parts.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, there is always a twofold condition pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded with <hi>Sphynx</hi> her <hi>Aenigmaes:</hi> To him that doth not expound them, diſtraction of mind; and to him that doth, a Kingdom; for he that knows that which he ſought to know, hath attained the end he aimed at, and every Artificer alſo commands over his work.</p>

Of <hi>Sphynx</hi> her Riddles, they are generally two kinds; ſome concerning the nature of things, others touching the nature of Man. So alſo there are two kinds of Empires, as rewards to thoſe that reſolve them. The one over Nature, the other over Men; for the proper and chief end of true Natural Philoſophy is to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand and ſway over Natural Beings; as Bodies, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, Mechanical Works, and infinite other things; although the School (being content with ſuch things as are offered, and priding it ſelf with Speeches) doth neglect realities and works, treading them as it were under foot. But that <hi>Aenigma</hi> propounded to <hi>Oedipus</hi> (by means of which he obtained the <hi>Theban</hi> Empire) belonged to the Nature of Man: For whoſoever doth throughly conſider the Nature of Man, may be in a manner the contriver of his own Fortune, and is born to command, which is well ſpoken of the <hi>Roman's</hi> Arts:</p>

                  <p>It was therefore very appoſite, that <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar</hi> (whether by Premeditation, or by a Chance) bare a <hi>Sphynx</hi> in his Signet: For he (if ever any) was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous not only in Political Government, but in all the courſe of his Life; he happily diſcovered many new <hi>Aenigmaes</hi> concerning the Nature of Man, which if he had not done with dexterity and promptneſs, he had often-times faln into imminent Danger and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, It is added in the Fable, that the Body of <hi>Sphinx,</hi> when ſhe was overcome, was laid upon an Aſs, which indeed is an elegant Fiction, ſeeing there is nothing ſo acute and abſtruſe, but (being well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,

                  <p>Neither is it to be omitted, that <hi>Sphynx</hi> was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by a Man lame in his Feet; for when Men are too ſwift of Foot, and too ſpeedy of Pace, in haſting to <hi>Spbynx</hi> her <hi>Aenigma's,</hi> it comes to paſs, that (ſhe getting the upper hand) their Wits and Minds are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſtracted by Diſputations, than that ever they come to command by Works and Effects.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>PLUTO,</hi> they ſay, being made King of the Infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Dominions, (by that memorable Diviſion,) was in deſpair of ever attaining any one of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Goddeſſes in marriage, eſpecially if he ſhould venture to Court them, either with Words, or with any amorous Behaviour; ſo that of neceſſity he was to lay ſome Plot to get one of them by Rapine: Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king therefore the Benefit of Opportunity, he caught up <hi>Proſerpina</hi> (the Daughter of <hi>Ceres,</hi> a beautiful Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,) as ſhe was gathering <hi>Narciſſus-Flowers</hi> in the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of <hi>Sicily,</hi> and carried her away with him in his Coach to the Subterranean Dominions; where ſhe was welcomed with ſuch Reſpect, as that ſhe was ſtiled the Lady of <hi>Dis.</hi> But <hi>Ceres,</hi> her Mother, when, in no place ſhe could find this her only beloved Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in a ſorrowful Humour, and diſtracted beyond meaſure, went compaſſing the whole Earth, with a burning Torch in her hand, to ſeek, and recover this her loſt Child. But when ſhe ſaw that all was in vain, ſuppoſing peradventure, that ſhe was carried to Hell, ſhe importuned <hi>Jupiter</hi> with many Tears and Lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, that ſhe might be reſtored unto her again; and at length, prevailed thus far, That if ſhe had taſted of nothing in Hell, ſhe ſhould have leave to bring her
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:94631:146"/>
from thence. Which Condition was as good as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial to her Petition, <hi>Proſerpina</hi> having already eaten three Grains of a <hi>Pomegranate:</hi> And yet, for all this, <hi>Ceres</hi> gave not over her Suit, but fell to Prayers and Moans afreſh: Wherefore, it was at laſt granted, that (the Year being divided) <hi>Proſerpina</hi> ſhould by alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Courſes, remain one ſix Months with her Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, and other ſix Months with her Mother. Not long after this, <hi>Theſeus,</hi> and <hi>Perithous,</hi> in an over-hardy Adventure, attempted to fetch her from <hi>Pluto</hi>'s Bed; who, being weary with Travel, and ſitting down up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Stone in Hell, to reſt themſelves, had not the Power to riſe again; but ſat there for ever. <hi>Proſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pina</hi> therefore remained Queen of Hell, in whoſe Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour there was this great privilege granted, That al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it were enacted, that none that went down to Hell ſhould have the power ever to return from thence; yet was this ſingular exception annexed to this Law, That if any preſented <hi>Proſerpina</hi> with a Golden Bough, it ſhould be lawful for him to go and come at his pleaſure. Now there was but one only ſuch a Bough in a ſpacious and ſhady Grove, which was not a Plant neither of it ſelf, but budded from a Tree of another kind, like a Rope of Gum, which being pluckt off, another would inſtantly ſpring out.</p>
                  <p>This Fable ſeems to pertain to Nature, and to dive into that rich and plentiful efficacy and variety of ſubalternal Creatures, from whom whatſoever we have is derived, and to them doth again return.</p>
                  <p>By <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> the Ancients meant that Aethereal Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which (being ſeparated from the upper Globe) is ſhut up and detained under the Earth (repreſented by <hi>Pluto)</hi> which the Poet well expreſt thus:</p>

                     <l>Whether the Youngling <hi>Tellus</hi> (that of late</l>
                     <l>Was from the high-rear'd <hi>Aether</hi> ſeparate)</l>
                     <l>Did yet contain her Teeming Womb within</l>
                     <l>The living Seeds of Heaven, her neareſt kin.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>This Spirit is feigned to be rapted by the Earth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing can with-hold it, when it hath time and leiſure to eſcape. It is therefore caught and ſtaid by a ſudden contraction, no otherwiſe than if a Man ſhould go about to mix Air with Water, which can be done by no means, but by a ſpeedy and rapid Agitation, as may be ſeen in Froth, wherein the Air is rapted by the Water.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it elegantly added, that <hi>Proſerpina</hi> was rapt as ſhe was gathering <hi>Narciſſus</hi> Flowers in the Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys, becauſe <hi>Narciſſus</hi> hath his Name from ſlowneſs or ſtupidity: for indeed then is this Spirit moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and fitted to be ſnatcht by Terreſtrial Matter, when it begins to be coagulated, and become as it were flown.</p>
                  <p>Rightly is <hi>Proſerpina</hi> honoured more than any of the other God's Bed-fellows, in being ſtiled the Lady of <hi>Dis,</hi> becauſe this Spirit doth rule and ſway all things in thoſe lower Regions, <hi>Pluto</hi> abiding ſtupid and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.</p>
                  <p>This Spirit the power Coeleſtial (ſhadowed by <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res)</hi> ſtrives, with infinite ſedulity, to recover and get again: For that Brand or burning Torch of <hi>Aether</hi> (which <hi>Ceres</hi> carried in her hand) doth doubtleſs ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the Sun, which enlightneth the whole Circuit of the Earth, and would be of greateſt moment to recover <hi>Proſerpina,</hi> if poſſible it might be.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Proſerpina</hi> abides ſtill; the Reaſon of which is accurately, and excellently propounded in the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Ceres:</hi> For, firſt, it is moſt certain there are two Ways to keep Spirit in ſolid and terreſtrial Matter; the one by Conſtipation and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:94631:147"/>
which is meer Impriſonment and Conſtraint; the other, by Adminiſtration, or proportionable Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment, which it receives willingly, and of its own accord: For after that the included Spirit begins to feed and nouriſh it ſelf, it makes no haſte to be gone; but is as it were, link'd to its Earth: And this is pointed at by <hi>Proſerpina</hi> her eating of <hi>Pomegranate;</hi> which if ſhe had not done, ſhe had long ſince been recovered by <hi>Ceres</hi> with her Torch, compaſſing the Earth. Now as concerning that Spirit which is in Metals and Minerals, it is chiefly perchance reſtrained by the ſolidity of Maſs: But that which is in Plants and Animals, inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits a porous Body, and hath open Paſſage to be gone, in a manner, as it liſts, were it not that it willingly abides of its own accord, by reaſon of the Reliſh it finds in its entertainment. The ſecond Condition concerning the ſix Months Cuſtom, it is no other than an elegant Deſcription of the Diviſion of the Year; ſeeing this Spirit mix'd with Earth, appears above Ground in Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable Bodies During the Summer-Months, and in the Winter ſinks down again.</p>
                  <p>Now as concerning <hi>Theſeus</hi> and <hi>Perithous,</hi> and their attempt to bring <hi>Proſerpina</hi> quite away, the meaning of it is, that it oftentimes comes to paſs that ſome more ſubtil Spirits deſcending with divers Bodies to the Earth, never come to ſuck of any ſubalternal Spirit, whereby to unite it unto them, and ſo to bring it away. But on the contrary are coagulated themſelves, and never riſe more, that <hi>Proſerpina</hi> ſhould be by that means aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with Inhabitants and Dominion.</p>
                  <p>All that we can ſay concerning that Sprig of Gold is hardly able to defend us from the violence of the <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks,</hi> if in this regard they ſet upon us, ſeeing they promiſe by that their <hi>Elixir</hi> to effect Golden Mountains, and the reſtoring of Natural Bodies, as it were, from the Portal of Hell. But concerning Chymiſtry, and thoſe perpetual Suitors for that Philoſophical <hi>Elixir,</hi> we know certainly that their <hi>Theory</hi> is without grounds,
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:94631:147"/>
and we ſuſpect that their Practice is alſo without cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain reward. And therefore (omitting theſe) of this laſt part of the Parable, this is my Opinion, I am indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to believe by many Figures of the Ancients, that the conſervation and reſtauration of natural Bodies, in ſome fort, was not eſteemed by them as a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to be attained, but as a thing abſtruſe and full of Difficulties, and ſo they ſeem to intimate in this place, when they report that this one only Sprig was found among infinite other Trees in a huge and thick Wood, which they feigned to be of Gold, becauſe Gold is the Badge of perpetuity, and to be artificially as it were inſerted, becauſe this effect is to be rather hoped for from Art, than from any Medicine, or ſimple or natural means.</p>

                  <p>The Senſe of this Fable (which at firſt apprehenſion may ſeem monſtrous and abſurd) contains in it a ſecret of State, to wit, with what policy Kings are wont to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry themſelves towards their Counſellors, whereby they may not only preſerve their Authority and Majeſty free and entire, but alſo that it may be the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolled and dignified of the People: For Kings being as it were tied and coupled in a Nuptial bond to their Counſellors, do truly conceive that communicating with them about the affairs of greateſt importance, do yet detract nothing from their own Majeſty. But
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:94631:148"/>
when any Matter comes to be cenſured or decreed (which is a birth) there do they confine and reſtrain the liberty of their Councellors; leſt that which is done ſhould ſeem to be hatcht by their Wiſdom and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſufficeth it, that it is done by the Authority of the King, by his meer will and free applauſe, except withal, this be added and appropriated as to iſſue out of his own Head or Brain, intimating, that out of his own Judgment, Wiſdom, and Ordinance, it was only invented and derived.</p>

                  <head>The SYRENS, or Pleaſures.</head>
                  <p>THE Fable of the <hi>Syrens</hi> ſeems rightly to have been applied to the pernicious allurements of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but in a very vulgar and groſs manner. And therefore to me it appears, that the Wiſdom of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients have with a farther reach or inſight ſtrained dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Matter out of them, not unlike the Grapes ill preſs'd; from which, though ſome Liquor were drawn, yet the beſt was left behind. Theſe <hi>Syrens</hi> are ſaid to be the Daughters of <hi>Achelous</hi> and <hi>Terpſichore</hi> one of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Who in their firſt being, were winged, but after raſhly entring into contention with the Muſes, were by them vanquiſhed, and deprived of their Wings. Of whoſe pluck'd out Feathers the Muſes made themſelves Coronets, ſo as ever ſince that time all the Muſes have
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:94631:148"/>
attired themſelves with plumed heads, except <hi>Terpſichore</hi> only, that was Mother to the <hi>Syrens.</hi> The Habitation of the <hi>Syrens</hi> was in certain pleaſant Iſlands, from whence as ſoon as out of their Watch-Tower they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered any Ships approaching, with their ſweet Tunes they would firſt entice and ſtay them, and having them in their Power would deſtroy them. Neither was their Song plain and ſingle, but conſiſting of ſuch variety of melodious Tunes ſo fitting and delighting the Ears that heard them, as that it raviſhed and betrayed all Paſſengers. And ſo great were the miſchiefs they did, that theſe Iſles of the <hi>Syrens,</hi> even as far off as Man can ken them, appeared all over white with the Bones of unburied Carcaſſes. For the remedying of this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery a double means was at laſt found out; the one by <hi>Ulyſſes,</hi> the other by <hi>Orpheus. Ulyſſes</hi> (to make experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Device) cauſed all the Ears of his Company to be ſtop'd with Wax, and made himſelf to be bound to the Main Maſt, with ſpecial Commandment to his Mariners not to be looſed, albeit himſelf ſhould require them ſo to do. But <hi>Orpheus</hi> neglected and diſdained to be ſo bound, with a ſhrill and ſweet Voice, ſinging Praiſes of the Gods to his Harp, ſuppreſs'd the Songs of they <hi>Syrens,</hi> and ſo free'd himſelf from their Danger.</p>
                  <p>This Fable hath relation to Men's Manners, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it a manifeſt and moſt excellent Parable: For Pleaſures do for the moſt proceed out of the abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance and ſuperfluity of all things, and alſo out of the delights and jovial contentments of the Mind; the which are wont ſuddenly, as it were, with winged Inticements to raviſh and rap mortal Men: But Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Education brings it ſo to paſs, as that it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains and bridles Man's Mind, making it ſo to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ends and events of Things, as that it clips the Wings of Pleaſure. And this was greatly to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and renown of the Muſes; for after that by ſome Examples, it was made manifeſt, that by the power of Philoſophy, vain Pleaſures might grow con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible;
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:94631:149"/>
it preſently grew to great eſteem, as a thing that could raiſe, and elevate the Mind aloft, that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be baſe, and fixed to the Earth, make the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitations of the Men (which do ever reſide in the Head, to be aethereal, and as it were winged.

But that of the Bones appearing like white Cliffs, and deſcried afar off, hath more Acuteneſs in it; for there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is ſignified, that, albeit the Examples of Afflictions be manifeſt, and eminent; yet do they not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deter us from the Wicked Enticements of Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
                  <p>As for the Remainder of this Parable, though it be not over-myſtical, yet it is very grave, and excellent: For in it are ſet out three Remedies for this violent, enticing Miſchief; to wit, Two from Philoſophy, and One from Religion. The firſt Means to ſhun theſe inordinate Pleaſures is, to withſtand, and reſiſt them in their beginnings, and ſeriouſly to ſhun all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions that are offered, to debauſh and entice the Mind, which is ſignified in that ſtopping of the Ears; and that Remedy is properly uſed by the meaner and baſer ſort of People, as it were, <hi>Ulyſſes</hi>'s Followers or Mariners; whereas more Heroick and Noble Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits may boldly converſe even in the midſt of theſe ſeducing Pleaſures, if with a reſolved conſtancy they ſtand upon their Guard, and fortifie their Minds; and ſo take greater contentment in the trial and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of this their approved Vertue; learning rather throughly to underſtand the Follies and Vanities of thoſe Pleaſures by Contemplation, than by Submiſſion: Which <hi>Solomon</hi> avouched of himſelf, when he reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the multitude of thoſe Solaces and Pleaſures wherein he Swam, doth conclude with this Sentence,</p>

But of all other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies in this caſe, that of <hi>Orpheus</hi> is moſt predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: For they that chaunt and reſound the praiſes of the Gods, confound and diſſipate the Voices and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantations of the <hi>Syrens;</hi> for Divine Meditations do not only in power ſubdue all ſenſual pleaſures; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo far exceed them in ſwiftneſs and delight.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>QUeen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was one, whom <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Fortune</hi> had made the Wonder of her <hi>Sex,</hi> and an Ornament to <hi>Crowned Heads.</hi> For the truth of this we need not appeal to the Teſtimony of any <hi>Monk,</hi> or of any ſuch like <hi>Solitary Recluſe:</hi> For tho theſe men write acutely, and have extraordinary Judgments; yet being wedded to, and byaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by their own Faction, they can never be faithful in tranſmitting a thing of this nature to Poſterity. But this is a Province that more properly belongs to men of the <hi>firſt Rank,</hi> to ſuch as have had the management of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi> in their own hands, and have been acquainted with the Secret Springs and moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Civil Affairs. Every Age has look'd upon a <hi>Female Government</hi> as a Rarity; if <hi>proſperous</hi> as a Wonder; but if <hi>proſperous</hi> and <hi>long,</hi> almoſt as a Miracle. Whereas tho ſhe reign'd full four and forty years, yet ſhe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liv'd not her <hi>happineſs.</hi> Of the <hi>happineſs</hi> of her Reign I deſign to ſay ſomething, without run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:94631:151"/>
out into high Encomiums. For Praiſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the Tribute of <hi>Men,</hi> but Happineſs the Gift of <hi>God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I take this to be the firſt ſtep to her <hi>happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> that from a Private condition ſhe was rais'd to the Adminiſtration of the <hi>Regal Power.</hi> Foraſmuch as 'tis a ſtanding Rule in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and common Senſe of Mankind, that thoſe things are to be look'd upon as our greateſt happineſs, which come beyond our hope and expectation. But this is not what I mean. That which I aim at is this, that <hi>Princes,</hi> who are bred up in <hi>Courts</hi> as the undoubted Heirs of a Crown, are ſo far debauch'd by a ſoft, indulgent and effeminate Education, that they frequently become leſs capable of manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the State: Whereas thoſe have proved the beſt and moſt excellent Princes, who have been under the Diſcipline of both Fortunes. We need not to go far for inſtances, <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Seventh</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Twelfth</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> within our own memory, and almoſt at the ſame time, mounted the Throne, not only from a Private, but alſo from an Adverſe and haraſs'd Fortune; and the one prov'd famous for his <hi>Prudence,</hi> the other for his <hi>Juſtice.</hi> This was the Caſe of Q. <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> whoſe Fortune was as inconſtant at the firſt, as at laſt, when ſhe came to the Crown, it prov'd Conſtant and Even. For at her <hi>Birth</hi> ſhe was declar'd Heireſs to the Throne, afterwards diſinherited, and at laſt deſpisd: during her <hi>Brother's Reign</hi> ſhe enjoy'd a more
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:94631:151"/>
ſerene and favourable Fortune, but whilſt her <hi>Siſter</hi> ſway'd the Scepter the Clouds and Storms return'd upon her again. Nor was ſhe advanc'd on a ſudden from a Priſon to a Throne, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to render her haughty after the Provocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her Sufferings: But being reſtor'd to her Liberty, and rais'd in her hopes, ſhe at laſt qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly and happily mounted the Throne, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Oppoſition or Competitor.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things I have mention'd, to ſhew how careful <hi>Divine Providence</hi> was of this beſt of <hi>Princes,</hi> by preparing her for a Crown by ſuch methods of Diſcipline. Nor ought the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of her <hi>Mother</hi> to Eclipſe the glory of her <hi>Birth:</hi> eſpecially ſince 'tis abundantly evident, that <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>Eighth</hi> was engag'd in a new love before he gave way to his Anger againſt Q. <hi>Ann:</hi> nor is poſterity a ſtranger to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of that <hi>King,</hi> which was ſo very prone to Love and Jealouſie, and proſecuted both even with the effuſion of Blood. To this we may add, that ſhe was cut off by an Accuſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on grounded on ſlight Conjectures, and on the improbable Teſtimony of a wicked Accuſer: all which was mutter'd privately at that very time; and Q. <hi>Ann</hi> herſelf with an undaunted mind, and noble preſence, proteſted her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence at the time of her Death. For having (as ſhe thought) got a faithful and generous Meſſenger, ſhe juſt before her execution diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcht him away with this Meſſage to the King; <hi>That the King had very well obſerv'd, and would ſtill keep his promiſe good to her, that was now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:94631:152"/>
                     <hi>to be inveſted with new honors: ſince from a Private Perſon he rais'd her at firſt to the dignity of a Marchioneſs, and then advanc'd her to be the Partner of his Bed and Throne; and now, when he could raiſe her no higher on Earth, deſign'd to promote her an Innocent to the Crown of Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> But the Meſſenger durſt not tell this to the <hi>King,</hi> who was devoted to another Love, tho <hi>Fame,</hi> the Aſſerter of Truth, has tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it to <hi>Poſterity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another part of the Happineſs of Q <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> ſeems to conſiſt in the Period and Courſe of time wherein ſhe reign'd: Not only that it was <hi>Long,</hi> but becauſe it was ſuch a Part of her Life, as was moſt fit for managing the Affairs of State, and governing a Kingdom. For ſhe was five and twenty years old when ſhe began her Reign (at which Age ſhe was out of her Guardians Juriſdiction) and ſhe continu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d to Reign to the 70th year of her Age. So that ſhe neither experienc'd what it was to be a <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> and under a Governors power; nor did ſhe labour under the Inconveniences of an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme and miſerable <hi>Old Age.</hi> An Age, which even to Private men brings too many troubles along with it; but to Kings, beſide the ordinary Miſeries of human Life, it comes attended with the Decay of their States, and is back'd with an <hi>inglorious Exit.</hi> For there has ſcarce been a King, that has liv'd to an extreme and infirm old Age, but what loſt much of that Power and Eſteem, which he formerly had. Of this we have a notable Inſtance in <hi>Philip</hi> the
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:94631:152"/>
                     <hi>Second,</hi> King of <hi>Spain,</hi> a Prince very potent, and one very well skill'd in the Art of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: who in his latter days, labouring under the Impotency of old Age, deeply experienc'd the truth of what we aſſerted. He quitted all his Conqueſts in <hi>France,</hi> made a Peace with that Nation, and endeavour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d to do the ſame with others, that ſo he might leave all things in quiet and compos'd to his Succeſſors. On the other hand, Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Fortune was ſo Conſtant and Vigorous, that no declenſion of Affairs follow'd her lively, tho declining Age. Nay more, for a ſtanding and moſt certain monument of her happineſs, ſhe died not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a Victory in <hi>Ireland</hi> had put an end to the Rebellion there, ſo ſhining and ſo uniform was her Glory in all its Parts! Beſides, I think it very material to reflect, over what ſort of People ſhe bore the ſway, for had her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment been over the <hi>Palmyrenians,</hi> or any other ſoft and unmanly Nation of <hi>Aſia,</hi> it had been a leſs wonder, ſince a <hi>Female</hi> in the Throne would be ſuitable enough to an <hi>Eſſeminate</hi> People, but to have all things move and be directed by a Woman's Nod in <hi>England,</hi> a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſo fierce and warlike; this, I ſay, juſtly raiſes our higheſt admiration.</p>
                  <p>But tho the <hi>Genius</hi> of her Subjects was ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of War, and ſo impatient of Peace, yet this did not hinder her from maintaining it ſtrictly all her Reign. And this natural incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of hers, join'd with ſucceſs, is what I reckon redounds to her higheſt Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:94631:153"/>
For this conduc'd much to the Happineſs of her own Life, to the Honor of her Sex, and to the Peace and Quiet of her Conſcience. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the tenth year of her Reign, an Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was indeed attempted in the <hi>North,</hi> but it was ſoon huſh'd and ſuppreſs'd. All the reſt of her time <hi>England</hi> enjoy'd a ſecure and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found Peace. And I account it a moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Peace, upon theſe two accounts; which tho they make nothing to the <hi>Merit,</hi> yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute very much to the <hi>Glory</hi> of a Peace. The firſt is, that it appear'd the more Conſpicuous and Shining by the Calamities of its Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, which were all in flames round about it. Another is, that even in the Bleſſings of Peace there ſtill remain'd ſo much martial Glory, as by its famous Actions not only retain'd, but likewiſe increas'd the honor of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For the ſupplies ſent into the <hi>Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, France,</hi> and <hi>Scotland;</hi> the Voyages that were made to the <hi>Indies,</hi> and round the whole World; the Fleets that were ſent to infeſt <hi>Portugal</hi> and the Coaſts of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh.</hi> Rebels ſo often conquer'd and cut off, were all ſufficient Teſtimonies, that <hi>England</hi> had remitted and loſt nothing of its Ancient Glory in the Field of War.</p>
                  <p>It was likewiſe an addition to her <hi>Glory</hi> and <hi>Deſerts,</hi> that by her timely ſupplies, the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Princes were maintain'd in their Thrones; and the Suppliant States, who by a conduct unbecoming Princes, were expos'd to the Cruelty of their Miniſters, to the ſury of
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:94631:153"/>
the Rabble, and to all manner of Ravage and Slaughter, were at laſt reliev'd by her and plac'd in that poſture of Affairs, wherein they now are. Nor were her <hi>Counſels</hi> leſs benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial than her <hi>Supplies:</hi> witneſs her frequent ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions to his <hi>Catholick Majeſty,</hi> to mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the diſpleaſure he had conceiv'd againſt his Subjects in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> and to reſtore them to that mildneſs of Government which they formerly enjoy'd: and witneſs her earneſt importunities with the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> putting them often in mind of the <hi>Edicts</hi> wherein they had promis'd to preſerve the Peace. It muſt indeed be acknowledg'd that her advices prov'd ineffectual. For the common intereſt of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> oppos'd the <hi>firſt,</hi> leſt the Ambition of <hi>Spain,</hi> freed as it were from its confinement, ſhould enlarge it ſelf (as affairs then ſtood) to the great prejudice of the Kingdoms and States of the Chriſtian World. And the <hi>Latter</hi> was prevented by the Maſſacre of ſo many Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Perſons, who with their Wives and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were butcher'd in their own Habitations by the barbarous Rabble, who like ſo many Beaſts of prey ſeem'd to be Animated, Armed, and ſent out by Publick Authority: So that the Blood which was ſhed cry'd aloud for <hi>Revenge,</hi> that the Kingdom, ſtain'd by ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious a Villany, might be purg'd by mutual Slaughters and Bloodſhed. However ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd the Office of a <hi>Faithful, Prudent,</hi> and <hi>Generous Ally.</hi>

There is ſtill another Reaſon, why we ſhould admire the peaceful Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> namely, becauſe the Peace which ſhe enjoy'd, was not owing to the inclination which the age ſhe liv'd in had to it, but wholly to her own Prudence and wiſe Conduct. She ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with an <hi>Inbred Faction</hi> at home, upon the account of Religion; and the ſtrength of the Kingdom, like the common Bulwark of all <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,</hi> ſeem'd to oppoſe the growing Greatneſs of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and his Ambition ſo formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at that time; ſo that upon theſe accounts, there was a ſufficient Cauſe of War: but by her Forces and Policy ſhe ſurmounted theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties. This was demonſtrated by one of the moſt memorable Events, that ever happened in the whole courſe of Affairs of our age. For when the <hi>Spaniſh Armada</hi> rode upon our Seas, to the terror of all <hi>Europe,</hi> with ſo much noiſe, and ſo much aſſurance of ſucceſs; it took not the leaſt Fiſher-boat, nor burnt the leaſt Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, nor ſo much as touched upon our Coaſt: but being routed in an Engagement, was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers'd by a miſerable flight, and with frequent ſtorms; and ſo left <hi>England</hi> and her Sea Coaſts in an unmov'd and undiſturbed Peace. Nor was ſhe leſs fortunate in diſappointing the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Plots of her private Foes, than in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering and Routing the Forces of an open Enemy: For tho there were many Conſpiracies laid againſt her Life, yet were they moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily diſcovered and defeated. Nor was ſhe upon that account more fearful or anxious of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:94631:154"/>
the ſafety of her Perſon; her Guards were not increas'd, nor did ſhe confine her ſelf in her Palace, without appearing abroad: But ſecure of her ſelf, and truſting to her Subjects, ſhe remembered her <hi>Deliverance,</hi> but forgot the <hi>Danger,</hi> and alter'd nothing of her uſual Management and Behaviour.</p>
                  <p>It is likewiſe worthy our Obſervation, to conſider in what ſort of times ſhe flouriſh'd. For ſome Ages are ſo Barbarous and Ignorant, that Men have been Govern'd with as much eaſe, as a Shepherd drives and manages his Sheep: But this Princeſs liv'd in a moſt Learned and Polite Age; wherein it requir'd great parts and a high degree of Vertue to be excellent. A <hi>Female Government</hi> is likewiſe very often eclips'd by <hi>Marriage,</hi> and all the Praiſes and Conduct is beſtow'd upon the <hi>Husband:</hi> whilſt thoſe who live unmarry<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>d, have no ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers or partners in their Glory. And in this was our Queen the more to be commended, in that her Throne ſtood upon no other <hi>Baſis,</hi> than what ſhe her ſelf had erected. She had no <hi>Brother,</hi> no <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle,</hi> nor any other of the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> to partake of her Cares, or ſhare in her Government. But even thoſe whom ſhe did advance to any places of Truſt, were ſo manag'd and kept in ſuch awe, that each of them was ſolicitous how to pleaſe her; ſo that ſhe was always <hi>Miſtreſs of her ſelf.</hi> She was indeed <hi>Childleſs,</hi> and left no iſſue of her own Body to ſucceed her: But this has been the caſe of the moſt fortunate Princes, of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>
                     <pb n="108" facs="tcp:94631:155"/>
                     <hi>the Great,</hi> of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> of <hi>Trajan,</hi> and ſeveral others: which has been variouſly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſur'd, and has always been a matter of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. For ſome have look'd upon it as a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution of <hi>human Happineſs,</hi> as if men could not be compleatly happy, unleſs they were ſo both in their own perſons, and in the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of their Species: but others have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem'd it as the greater Happineſs, becauſe then it ſeems to be compleat, when it is not any longer ſubjected to the various turns of Fortune: which 'tis impoſſible to ſecure, when a Poſterity is left behind.</p>
                  <p>To all this we may add her <hi>Outward Embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhments;</hi> ſhe was tall of <hi>ſtature,</hi> well ſhap'd in her Body, and had in her Face the mixture of <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> and <hi>Majeſty;</hi> and always enjoy'd a very <hi>Sound Health.</hi> Beſide all this, ſhe was ſtrong and vigorous to the very laſt, never experienc'd the Changes of Fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Juſt ſo in Q. <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi>'s Diſtemper, there was nothing that was deadly, or ominous, or unſuitable to humane nature. She was not deſirous of Life, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient under Sickneſs, nor diſturb'd with the tortures of any Pain: No direful, no peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lential Symptom appear'd, but every thing
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:94631:155"/>
ſeem'd rather to prognoſticate the decay of Nature, than either the corruption or diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of it. For ſome few days before her Death, being weakened by the drineſs of her Conſtitution, and the cares of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having not ſo much as drank any Wine, or taken any moiſt diet, ſhe was ſeiz'd with a <hi>Dead Palſy,</hi> but yet (which is not uſual in that Diſtemper) ſhe retained her Speech, her Senſe, and her Motion, tho not ſo brisk and lively as before. Nor was ſhe long in this condition, ſo that it did not ſeem to be the <hi>laſt Act</hi> of her Life, but rather the <hi>firſt ſtep</hi> to her Death. For tho 'tis eſteemed a miſery to live a long time in the loſs of the uſe of our faculties; yet to be prepar'd for Death, by a gradual decay of our ſenſes, is certainly a very ſweet and pleaſant <hi>Diſſolution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another remarkable addition to her <hi>Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs,</hi> is this, that ſhe was not only very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in her own <hi>Perſon,</hi> but likewiſe in the Worthineſs of her <hi>Miniſters</hi> of <hi>State.</hi> For ſhe made choice of ſuch men, as this <hi>Iſland</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps was never ſo happy in before. But <hi>God</hi> that favours <hi>Kings,</hi> raiſes them up <hi>Miniſters</hi> and adorns their Minds.</p>
                  <p>There remain two <hi>Poſthumous Felicities,</hi> which ſeem to attend the more Noble and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt Paſſages of her Life: The <hi>One</hi> is that of her <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> the <hi>Other,</hi> that of her <hi>Memory.</hi> For ſhe has got ſuch a <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> who, tho by his <hi>Maſculine Virtue,</hi> and <hi>Off-ſpring,</hi> and <hi>late Acceſſion to the Throne,</hi> he may excel and eclipſe
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:94631:156"/>
her Glory; yet is ſo far a favourer of her <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Eſteem,</hi> and is ſo willing to tranſmit her actions to poſterity, that he has made little alterations, either in the <hi>choice</hi> of <hi>Miniſters,</hi> or in the <hi>method of Governing.</hi> So that hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly any <hi>Father</hi> has been ſucceeded by his <hi>Son,</hi> with leſs noiſe, diſturbance or alteration. As for her <hi>Memory,</hi> 'tis ſo much in the mouths, and ſo freſh in the minds of all men, that <hi>Death</hi> ſeems to have extinguiſhed Envy, and put her Fame in a clearer light, and now the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of her <hi>Memory</hi> does as it were ſtrive to outvie that of her <hi>Life.</hi> For tho through mens love to any Party, or upon the account of the difference of Religion, any factious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port may be ſpread abroad, yet 'tis ſuch as ſeems to be fearful of it ſelf, is not ſincere, and can never laſt long. And 'tis upon this account eſpecially that I have made this collection of things, that relate to her happineſs, and are marks of the Divine favour: that ſo no foul-mouthed Libeller might dare to ſtain ſo great bleſſings of God, by the venom of his ſcandalous Tongue. If any one ſhould now ſay, as one did to <hi>Caeſar, quae miremur, habe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus; ſed quae laudemus, expectamus; we do in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſee cauſe to Admire, but none to Praiſe:</hi> to this I anſwer, that I look upon <hi>Admiration</hi> as the ſuperlative degree of <hi>Praiſe.</hi> Nor could that <hi>Happineſs</hi> we have been deſcribing, be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by any, but ſuch as are ſupported and highly indulged by the Divine favour; and ſuch as in ſome meaſure by their <hi>Morals</hi> and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:94631:156"/>
                     <hi>Vertue</hi> are the Eſtabliſhers of their own <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</hi> However I thought fit to ſubjoin ſome few hints with reſpect to thoſe <hi>Morals</hi> of the Queen, which ſeem to have been moſt expoſed to the laſh of malevolent Tongues.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Religion,</hi> Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was <hi>Pious</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, Conſtant</hi> and <hi>Steady,</hi> and a profeſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to <hi>Novelty.</hi> As for her <hi>Piety,</hi> tho the chief ſtrokes of it appeared in the Actions and Affairs of State; yet ſome ſigns of it were to be ſeen in the courſe of her Life, and her ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Converſation. She was ſeldom abſent from <hi>Divine Service,</hi> either in her <hi>publick or private Chappel.</hi> She employed much of her time in reading the <hi>Scriptures</hi> and the <hi>Writings</hi> of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> eſpecially of S. <hi>Auguſtin.</hi> She compos'd ſome Prayers her ſelf, upon ſome oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, and for ſome extraordinary purpoſe. Whenever ſhe mentioned the name of <hi>God,</hi> even in ordinary diſcourſe, ſhe generally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the title of <hi>Creator;</hi> and ſhewed ſome ſort of humility and reverence in her looks and countenance, which I my ſelf have often ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. As for that which ſome have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, that ſhe was ſo far from thinking of her <hi>Mortality,</hi> that ſhe could not endure to be told of <hi>Old Age</hi> or <hi>Death,</hi> it is abſolutely falſe: ſince ſhe her ſelf, ſeveral years before her Death, would frequently with much face<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs call her ſelf <hi>the Old Woman:</hi> and would often diſcourſe about the <hi>Inſcription,</hi> ſhe had a mind ſhould be upon her <hi>Tomb:</hi> She gave out, that ſhe was no lover of Glory
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:94631:157"/>
and pompous Titles, but only deſired her Memory might be recorded in a line or two, which ſhould very briefly expreſs her <hi>Name,</hi> her <hi>Virginity,</hi> the <hi>time of her Reign, the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Religion, and her Preſervation of the Peace.</hi> 'Tis true, in the flower of her Age be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhe was paſt Child-bearing, when ſhe was importun'd by ſome to declare her <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> ſhe did make anſwer, <hi>that ſhe could by no means endure to have a Shroud held before her Eyes while ſhe was living.</hi> However, ſome few years before her Death, when ſhe was more thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and meditated (as 'tis probable) on her <hi>Mortality,</hi> as one of her boſom friends told her, that many and great Places and Offices of Truſt in the Commonwealth, would be too long vacant; ſhe roſe up, and with more than ordinary concern ſaid, <hi>that ſhe was ſure her place would not long be Vacant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for her <hi>Moderation</hi> in <hi>Religion,</hi> perhaps in this her <hi>Character</hi> will ſeem deficient, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the <hi>ſeverity of thoſe Laws,</hi> which were made againſt her Subjects of the <hi>Romiſh Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> but we will produce ſuch things, as are well known to us, and carefully taken notice of by us. This is certain, that ſhe was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways averſe from laying any conſtraint on mens Conſciences: but yet ſhe could not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that the Government ſhould be endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd under the pretence of <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi> Hence it was that ſhe thought nothing but a certain deſtruction would enſue, if ſhe ſhould at the firſt grant a liberty and tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:94631:157"/>
of two Religions by publick Authority to a fierce and headſtrong people, who would ſoon upon their private Animoſities fall to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether by the ears. Even in the beginning of her Reign, when all things looked with a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious face, ſhe kept ſome of the <hi>Prelates,</hi> which were of a more turbulent and factious ſpirit, Priſoners at large, tho ſhe had the Law on her ſide: and to the reſt of both Orders, ſhe uſed not any ſharp inquiſition, but by a generous Connivance kept them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der her Protection. This was the poſture of affairs at firſt. Nor did ſhe ſwerve much from this her <hi>Clemency,</hi> tho provoked by the Bull of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> thundered againſt her by <hi>Pius the Fifth.</hi> This indeed might have raiſed her indignation, and have been the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of new modelling the State, but ſtill ſhe retained her own generous Temper. For this Prudent and Courageous Woman was not much moved at the noiſe of ſuch Threatnings, being ſecure of the Fidelity and Affection of her Subjects, and not fearing any harm from the <hi>Romiſh Faction,</hi> which was too weak to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing unleſs ſeconded by a foreign. Enemy.</p>
                  <p>But about the three and twentieth year of her Reign, the face of Affairs was quite chang'd. Nor is this Period of time, feigned to ſerve a turn only, but mentioned in the <hi>Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords,</hi> and engraven as it were in <hi>leaves of Braſs.</hi> Nor were her Subjects of the <hi>Romiſh Religion</hi> puniſhed with any ſeverity before that
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:94631:158"/>
year, tho ſeveral Laws had formerly been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted againſt them. But at this time it was by degrees diſcovered what vaſt and ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous deſigns were laid by <hi>Spain,</hi> to conquer this Kingdom A great part of this deſign was to raiſe a faction in the very heart of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which being no friends to the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and deſirous of alteration, ſhould join with the Enemy upon his Invaſion. This was hoped would be effected upon the difference there was in Religion: whereupon they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to improve that breach, and Prieſts were ſent over from the young <hi>Seminaries,</hi> to raiſe and increaſe Mens Love for the <hi>Romiſh Religion,</hi> to teach and inforce the Validity of the <hi>Popes Bull,</hi> which abſolved the Queens Subjects from their Allegiance, and to excite and prepare the Minds of men for an Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Government.</p>
                  <p>Much about that time, <hi>Ireland</hi> was openly invaded, and the <hi>Name</hi> and <hi>Government</hi> of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> vilified by various and Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous Libels; and affairs were in ſuch a ſtrange ferment, that they prognoſticated a greater Commotion. Nor indeed will I ſay, that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Prieſt</hi> knew of the deſign, or were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of what was to be done, but certainly they were the wicked Inſtigators and Promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Villany others were to commit. And this is certainly true, (as appears by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Confeſſions) that almoſt all the Prieſts, who were ſent into <hi>England</hi> from the year abovemention'd, to the thirtieth year of Queen
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:94631:158"/>
                     <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign (wherein the Deſign of <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> was to be put in Execution, by that memorable preparation of a Fleet and Land-forces) I ſay tis certain, that all, who were ſent over within that time, among other things had this likewiſe in their Orders, That they ſhould inſinuate, <hi>That Affairs could not laſt long in the ſame poſture; that they would put on a new Face within ſome ſhort time and that the Pope and the Catholick Princes would take care of the</hi> Engliſh <hi>State, provided the</hi> Engliſh <hi>were not their own hinderance.</hi> Nay, ſome of the Prieſts were manifeſtly engag'd in the Plots and Contrivances which were laid for the Subverſion and Ruin of the <hi>Government:</hi> and which is ſtill more, the whole Train of this Deſign was diſcover'd by Letters which were intercepted from all parts: wherein it was written, <hi>That the Vigilancy of the Queen and her Council over the Catholicks would be baffled: For ſhe only ſeem'd concern'd, that the Faction ſhould not be headed by any Nobleman or Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; whereas the Deſign they laid was ſuch, as was carried on by Private Men of no Note; who never met and conſpir'd together in numbers, but order'd and diſpos'd all things in the private way of Confeſſion.</hi> Theſe were the <hi>Artifices</hi> which were then us'd, and were ſo cuſtomary and familiar to thoſe Men, as might be ſeen in a freſh and parallel caſe.</p>
                  <p>In a time of ſo much danger, Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was obliged by a kind of fatal neceſſity to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nact ſevere Laws, thereby to reſtrain thoſe of
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:94631:159"/>
her Subjects, who being averſe to her Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and grown paſt the hopes of being cur'd, began to grow rich by the private Life they led, being exempted from the charge and burden of publick Offices. The Original of this ſpreading Evil was charg'd upon the <hi>Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Priests;</hi> who were bred up in foreign parts, and maintain'd by the Charity and Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence of <hi>Foreign Princes</hi> the profeſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Realm: who had liv'd in places, where the beſt Titles they could beſtow on Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> were thoſe of, <hi>Heretick, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated, and Damnable Fury;</hi> who, tho they themſelves were not engag'd in treaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble practices, yet were known to be the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Friends of ſuch as were guilty of thoſe Villanies, and who, by their Artifices and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous Methods had depraved the very Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> which before was a ſweet and harmleſs thing; and had as it were infected it with a new kind of Ferment and pernicious Malignity. Whereupon the only Expedient to put a ſtop to this growing Evil was thought to be the prohibiting theſe Men from coming into the Land upon pain of Death; which was accordingly enacted in the ſeven and twentieth Year of her Reign. Nor did the Event itſelf, when ſo great a Storm broke out upon, and threatned the Nation, in the leaſt take off from the Envy and Hatred of theſe Men, but rather increas'd it; ſo far had they diveſted themſelves of the Love they ow'd their Country. Afterwards when our fears
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:94631:159"/>
of <hi>Spain</hi> (the true occaſion of this ſeverity) were over and vaniſht; yet the Memory of the former times was ſo deeply fixt in the Minds and Senſes of moſt Men, and to have abrogated the Laws that were once made would have argued ſo much <hi>Inconſtancy,</hi> or to have ſlighted them would have been a ſign of ſo much <hi>Indifferency;</hi> that Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> as caſes then ſtood, did not think it ſafe for her ſelf, that things ſhould return to the ſame poſture they were in before the three and twentieth year of her Reign. To this may be added the <hi>Induſtry</hi> of ſome to increaſe the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and the <hi>Care</hi> of thoſe <hi>Miniſters of Juſtice,</hi> who are us'd to mind no other Safety of their Country than what is contain'd in the Laws: both which requir'd and call'd loudly for the Laws to be put in Execution. However, ſhe (to the Glory of her good Nature be it ſpoken) did ſo far blunt the edge of the Laws, that but very few Prieſts ſuffer'd Death upon that account. Nor do we ſpeak this by way of defence, for theſe matters ſtand in need of none: ſince the whole Safety of the Nation depended upon this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and the Method and Meaſure of all this Severity was far from being bloody, and is a thing that no Chriſtian need to be aſham'd of; for it proceeded more from the Arrogance and Wicked Practices of others, than from any neceſſity the Nation lay under, and it ſtands for a Monument of Diſgrace to the <hi>Romaniſts.</hi> But not to forget what we firſt aſſerted, we
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:94631:160"/>
think we have abundantly demonſtrated, that ſhe was <hi>moderate</hi> in points of <hi>Religion,</hi> and that the Alteration which did happen, was not owing to her Nature, but to the Iniquity of the times.</p>
                  <p>Of her <hi>Conſtancy</hi> in <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>Worſhip</hi> thereof, the greateſt proof is, That with an undaunted Mind and little Aſſiſtance ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated and abrogated the <hi>Romiſh Religion,</hi> as being diſagreeable to the <hi>Word of God,</hi> the <hi>Primitive Purity,</hi> and her own <hi>Conſcience:</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding in her <hi>Siſter's Reign</hi> it was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by Publick Authority and a great deal of Care, and had taken deep root, and was ſtrengthned with the Conſent and Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all that were in Authority and Places of Truſt. Nor did ſhe do this haſtily or in a heat, but cautiouſly and by degrees. The truth of which appears not only in her whole Conduct of Affairs, but alſo in that Anſwer which ſhe once made to a <hi>Courtier</hi> upon the like occaſion. For in the beginning of her Reign, when according to the Cuſtom the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners</hi> were to be releas'd, to grace and honor her firſt Acceſſion to the Throne; as ſhe was going to Chappel ſhe was accoſted by a certain <hi>Courtier,</hi> who took more than ordinary free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, being of a pleaſant and facetious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He, either prompted to it by his own private Inclination, or ſet on by a Wiſer Head, deliver'd a <hi>Petition</hi> into her hand, and in a full Concourſe of People with a loud Voice expreſſed himſelf thus, <hi>Tnat there were ſtill four</hi>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:94631:160"/>
                     <hi>or five kept Priſoners, and that for no reaſon at all: That he came to petition for their Freedom, as well as for the reſt: That they were the Four Evangeliſts, and the Apoſtle S.</hi> Paul, <hi>who had been long confin'd in an unknown tongue, as it were in a Priſon, and were not ſuffer'd to appear abroad in the World.</hi> The Queen gave him this very cautious Reply, <hi>That it was beſt to conſult them firſt, whether they were willing to have their Freedom yet, or no.</hi> And thus ſhe kept every thing within her own Power, by giving ſuch a doubtful Anſwer to ſo ſurprizing a Demand. Nor did ſhe carry on things fearfully, and by fits and ſtarts, but gravely, orderly, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turely: A Conference firſt had between the Parties, and a <hi>Parliament</hi> firſt call'd; and at laſt, within the compaſs of a year, ſhe ſo far order'd and eſtabliſh'd all things which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd <hi>Religion,</hi> that ſhe did not ſuffer the leaſt Tittle of them to be alter'd, during all her Reign. And it was always her Publick Admonition in almoſt every Seſſion of <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that no Innovation ſhould be made in the <hi>Diſcipline</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> Thus far of her Religion.</p>
                  <p>Now if any of the <hi>graver Sort</hi> ſhould object theſe <hi>Levities:</hi> 
                     <q>That ſhe was contented and deſirous to be Admir'd, to be Courted, and upon the Account of Love to be Prais'd and Extoll'd; and that ſhe continu'd theſe Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties even to an Age wherein they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming her.</q> Yet if you take even theſe in a milder ſenſe, they are not without their
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:94631:161"/>
due <hi>Admiration,</hi> ſince they are ſuch things, as often are to be found in the <hi>fubulous Narrations</hi> of Poets and others. Thus 'tis recorded of a certain Queen in the <hi>Fortunate Iſlands,</hi> who in her Court and Government entertain'd that ſoft thing call'd <hi>Love,</hi> and yet forbad <hi>Luſt</hi> to enter there. But if a harſher conſtruction ſhould be put upon them, yet they are to be admir'd, and that very highly too, ſince theſe <hi>Softneſſes</hi> caſt but little blemiſh on her <hi>Fame,</hi> and none at all upon her <hi>Grandeur;</hi> did no Injury to her Government, and hinder'd not the Publick Adminiſtration of Affairs. For theſe ſort of things are uſually joyn'd to the moſt Noted Fortune. But, to conclude this Eſſay; ſhe was certainly a <hi>good, moral Princeſs,</hi> and as ſuch ſhe deſir'd to appear: She was a hater of <hi>Vice,</hi> and ſtudy'd to grow famous by <hi>honorable Methods.</hi> And truly at the naming of her <hi>Manners,</hi> ſomething comes into my mind, which I will here declare. When ſhe had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd an Expreſs to be written to her Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, concerning certain Inſtructions, which he was privately to impart to the Queen Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>France</hi> at <hi>Valois,</hi> and her Secretary had incerted a certain Clauſe, that the Embaſſador to ingratiate himſelf the better ſhould ſay, <hi>That they were two Female Princes, of whom, in the Management of Affairs, and in the Art and Skill of Governing, as great things were expected as from the beſt of Men;</hi> ſhe could not endure the Compariſon, but order'd it to be ſtruck out, and ſaid, that <hi>ſhe us'd quite different Arts</hi>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:94631:161"/>
                     <hi>and Methods in the Adminiſtration of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> And ſhe was extreamly pleas'd, when any one by chance dropt out ſuch an Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion as this, <hi>That ſhe would have liv'd and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell'd in the Eye of the VVorld, tho ſhe had ſpent her days in a private and mean Station:</hi> So deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous was ſhe that nothing of her <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Praiſe</hi> ſhould be owing to the <hi>Grandeur</hi> of her <hi>Fortune.</hi> But if I ſhould enter upon her Praiſes, either <hi>Moral</hi> or <hi>Political,</hi> or ſhould touch only upon her <hi>Virtues,</hi> which would be a Diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſo great a Princeſs: or ſhould I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſet them in their clear and proper light, I muſt run out into the <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of her Life, which requires more leiſure, and a larger Genius, than I can pretend to. For I have here given you her <hi>Character</hi> in ſhort. But it muſt after all be ſaid, That only <hi>Time</hi> will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow a true Encomium on this Excellent Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: ſince no Age ſince the Creation, could ever ſhew her <hi>Equal</hi> in her own <hi>Sex,</hi> that was ſo fit to manage the Affairs of a State.</p>
