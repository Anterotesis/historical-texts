            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne unto me (my dear Sonnes) how many persons of quality have bestow'd their Pens on this <hi>Subject,</hi> wherein I am to address my self out of my fatherly and tender care towards you. The ground of my discourse shall be <hi>Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:35958:4"/>
whereto, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent you will be ready to give the more serious atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in regard it proceeds from his mouth, and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his heart; who with a parental and tender affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ever loved you while he was living: and now dying leaves you this <hi>Memorial</hi> as my <hi>last Legacy</hi> for your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture benefit, improvement and direction. Our last ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions usually retain the deepest impression; especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, being uttered by a tongue whose relation did highly indear us; and whose words are the very last he shall speak upon earth: being within few houres to pay his debt to Nature: and stand at
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35958:4"/>
that Barre, and appear before that <hi>High Court of Justice,</hi> from whence no <hi>Appeal</hi> will be admitted. But my <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble</hi> must not be long, see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the definite <hi>Sentence</hi> of death hath limited my time so short.</p>
            <p>My beginning shall receive life from <hi>Him,</hi> from whom we all derive our beginning; whom you are above all things to fear: and that with no servile but filial fear; not so much for <hi>fear</hi> of <hi>punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> or <hi>hope</hi> of <hi>reward,</hi> as out of pure zeal and cordial love to his sacred Majesty; who will recompence our momentany sufferings with Crownes of immortal glory: and cloath our constancy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:35958:5"/>
with incorruptible robes of beauty. But no <hi>combat,</hi> no <hi>conquest;</hi> you are to fight a <hi>good fight</hi> before your <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare</hi> become a <hi>triumph.</hi> And trust me, my Dear Sons, such influence has my long impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonment wrought upon me: nay, such divine operations has his powerful Spirit acted upon my poor Soul: as I hold him a weak-hearted souldier, that faints under the conduct of such a Commander; who patiently died for our sins: and victoriously rose for our justification. I must inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuously confess, that upon my first restraint, my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict was something difficult; before I attained this Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian attemperature and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posure
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:35958:5"/>
to my resolves: I could not for a season, but friendly converse with <hi>that,</hi> which I now mortally hate. He that consorts with the <hi>Pelican,</hi> cannot chuse but smell of the <hi>Wilderness.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I begun by help of my so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude and long retirement (a place to me of infinite improvement) to recollect my self, and seriously to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate how my too near and familiar society with the <hi>world,</hi> (though never deeply drenched in it) was the high way to procure a divorce with God. It was my study therefore to leave it with my affection, before such time as I became enjoyned to leave it by a necessitated dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35958:6"/>
I considered how the life of a wise man was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God; and to hold all things under him as <hi>Seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries:</hi> Him onely the <hi>Primary Good.</hi> This was the Mirror that flattered not.</p>
            <p>During my late privacy, occasioned by my captivity, store of vacant houres were reserved for me; the expence whereof conduced more highly to my inward benefit and advantage, then all my fore-past liberty. For before I knew not what it was to wrastle with my self, till re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint (an useful, though un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>welcom Messenger) brought me to a due and exact consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of my self; and the present condition whereto I
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35958:6"/>
was reduced. Yet in this my retire and recesse from the world, I could not chuse but encounter with some dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>Remoraes</hi> to foreslow my passage and proficience. Assiduate Offices of profest amity, visits of friends with other obligiug ties of relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were daily contriving new, but affectionate wayes, how to call me from my self, and reduce my thoughts to a more familiar converse with the world: and considerable motives to induce, and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual enough to operate up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a meer humane fancy, were presented to me: but none more powerfull act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, then my tender reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on upon your young and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>experienced
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:35958:7"/>
condition, my dearest children: whom, as it had ever been my constant care to educate in a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sponsive way to your extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: so it was my desire that my ancient and lineally descended estate, might without incumbrance fall upon you my Elder Sonne: together with such a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent conferment upon your younger Brother, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency of his fortunes might disingage him of that servile condition; which too usually the young Gentry of our Land, through neglect of timely provision, become liable to, I mean <hi>beholding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> or dependence on the Elder. The discussion of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:35958:7"/>
these, seriously weighed, brought me to consider, what I could not forget with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; how you were those precious pledges wherein I had treasured all my inferior hopes, being next in care to the eternity of my Soul. In this my Treaty with the World, I bethought me like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise how your <hi>virtuous Sister,</hi> whose pure and unblemished fame has conferred an high additament to my comfort: and incomparably revived me in this my irrevocable Sentence to the Scaffold; how She, I say, was not to be neglected, but highly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred: for though she ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared compleatly qualified, and with the choicest orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:35958:8"/>
of Nature richly fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished; nay, with Noble Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations sufficiently strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned yet there is something more required to make a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Honour, be she never so personally accomplished, a Mistress of great For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.</p>
            <p>These were thoughts of a long discourse, and strong debate: neither, were they with less vehemency second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by such, whose setled and immutable affections (such was their integrious candor and intimacy to me in my greatest extremes) aimed no less in their prudent advice, at the future success and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanceme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of mine then their own. And their Bosome-Counsels
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:35958:8"/>
dispatched it; so as, what the <hi>constancy</hi> (or what others termed it, <hi>perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy</hi>) of opinion would not assent to, the amicable care of faithfull <hi>Trustees</hi> effected. This quieted my thoughts, and brought me again to my self.</p>
            <p>And I found this calm and well setled composure, a precious princely structure. I found no Billows dispassi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onately acting to endanger the passage of my late sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged Vessell: All appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to me as in a calm Sea: and as one in a safe harbour, I begun to recall to mind those Divine Contemplati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; which my late converse with secular occasions, had
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:35958:9"/>
so prejudicially estranged from me. I begun to take a more serious view of what I had to my intellectual gain observed, and what I had in my own default neglected, I took my mark as by a Landskip, how the world was a shop of disguises and false faces. And I concluded upon my review of these, summing them up to their utmost period: How <hi>all things were vanity, save onely to please God, and to serve him.</hi> Make this your Anchor-hold, and you may saile safely; you shall manage your affections with that equal and discreet temper, as nothing can be possibly acted by you to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage you: or lay the least
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:35958:9"/>
aspersion on your honour. It is not to be questioned, but the high estimate that men set upon this world, cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives their affections: making them heavily leave what they did so heartily love. For what men enjoy with delight, they must necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily forgoe with grief. Be continent then in your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, and indifferent in your enjoyments, and you shall leave, what you did so cool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly love without disgust. But this would prove a receipt of hard digestion to their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machs, on whom these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour contentments have taken seasure: make devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion then your complete Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, to secure you on the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:35958:10"/>
Main, and conduct you to a peaceful Harbour. The only way to free you from this servitude, is to bring the world to serve you, and not you it. Being ever observed to be an imperious Mistress, but a submissive Servant.</p>
            <p>I shall now take occasion to make my recede from the World (as I find my enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed houres neer approching) and take a turn or two in the Temple; But fearful be my feet to enter into the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary with too much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: I shall not, though you be mine own, propose to you Rules of <hi>Religion:</hi> I hope your education by the assistance of Gods Spirit, hath already initiated and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:35958:10"/>
grounded you in those Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples that may not only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form your knowledge how to believe; but for the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive part too, what to do that you may eternally live; yet excuse my fears, I cannot leave you so: though my desires have ever gone along with an humble fervour of being rather an <hi>Hearer,</hi> then a <hi>Teacher:</hi> my tender zeal to your proficience and progress in Christs School, will not suffer me to omit any thing that may necessarily conduce to your spiritual inabling in matters of eternity.</p>
            <p>Above all things, then my Deare Ones, be it your especial care to beware of <hi>Novellisme.</hi> It is this
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:35958:11"/>
whose pernicious seed has spread so many dangerous Sects, Schismes and Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies. Nay, the onely ruine to the foundation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: having begot so many main breaches and fearful rents in the Church; as it is above the compasse of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wisedome to make up the decayes of so disjointed a Fabrick: or how to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive a way for repair of those demolitions: As it is the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God that can onely effect it, so may his name onely have the glory of it.</p>
            <p>For you my Sonnes, may it be your desire rather to appear faithful and fervorous Professors, then forward and contentious Disputants.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:35958:11"/>
It has been an inherent property to many of our ancient <hi>School-men,</hi> either transported with the Spirit of singularity: or from some other discontent arising from their fruitlesse pursuit after some especiall Office or place of Preferment; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Lists: and become profest Champions for broaching Errour and Sediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; by embroiling the quiet of the Church, and exposing the long-continued Unity which she formerly enjoyed, to those fatall miseries of endlesse Divisions: which broke forth into Nationall Quarrels, and such implaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Hostility; as the Church became a constant Patient.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:35958:12"/>
But no hand so inclinable to pity, as to apply to her bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wounds a timely remedy. Now, resolve me, did not such Arguments springing from the brains of those am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious and opinionate Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries produce bitter fruits, when their poysonous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine begot such dangerous distractions in many flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eminent States? Lend not your least attention to these: the perversnesse of their spirits usually invert all sense: and the inconfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of their depraved Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, will sooner entangle then inform your Judgment. You have learned better things: rely then on those just and orthodoxall Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

which retaine in them that powerful efficacy, as they will teach you how to believe, and how to live. By which means (for a better rule I cannot prescribe you) your blameless Conversati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall manifest to the world the fruits of your faith. How fruitlesly bestowed are those empty hours, that are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed with what subtilty of arguments they may <hi>dispute,</hi> but never with what purity they may <hi>live.</hi> Polite O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators, but prophane Profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors. Such Sophisters are but titular Christians. Believe it, there ought to be no contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versie, but conference among the Servants of Christ. Which being discraetly sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:35958:13"/>
with meekness and mildness, beget more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts to Gods honour, then a thousand fiery spirits shall ever do, by speaking in thunder.</p>
            <p>I would not willingly be thought to fall short of that Parental zeal which I owe you. Men have nothing to give, but what they receive; and what I have received, I shall here by advice freely communicate unto you. <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection</hi> to <hi>Superiours</hi> is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of high consequence; I shall not insist on each parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; it is too large a field to walk in, and to lofty an ayer to descant on: It may suffice, that I am to sacrifice my life in that contest: and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:35958:13"/>
without aversnesse in so high an interest. For you my Sons, be it your especiall care to submit your selves to your <hi>Superiours</hi> in all <hi>lawful things.</hi> It is an undispensable injun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: and ought by persons of each distinct quality, when they are <hi>conscientiously</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to obliged, to be <hi>religiously</hi> observed. This might seem to oppose my Tenent; but I shall make it perspicuously appeare to any uninteres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed judgement, much other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Crime</hi> wherewith I stood charged, was <hi>Treason;</hi> which my Conscience dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me, bare the Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of Loyalty. To which Principles, as I was nursed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:35958:14"/>
it, so I mean to death to continue a constant professor of it; wherein if any one, as there be many, should oppose my opinion; and tax me first of obstinacy in my refusing to submit to any <hi>Composition:</hi> and since in appealing from the Jurisdiction of that <hi>High Court;</hi> whereto I concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved I could not be in a capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to be subject, being nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>sworn</hi> nor <hi>known</hi> unto it. Though I was, as some thought, slow in my <hi>Reply</hi> and personall defence at the Barre; may it stand with the patience of good men to heare the modest Apology which I here recommend to their perusall after my death: wherein, my dear ones,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:35958:14"/>
you may return a grateful of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to your dying Father, in communicating it to our Relations; or any Persons of Quality that shall hereafter request it. <hi>Words</hi> spoken in <hi>season</hi> retain <hi>precious resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances;</hi> but I am confident, no words could have been spoken by me at my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment, that would have been construed seasonable: So highly was the <hi>Presidentall Court</hi> prepossessed against me. My defence shall be short, dissecting it self into two particulars.</p>
            <div type="part">

               <p>THe first relates to a Case of Conscience;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:35958:15"/>
which to oppose even in matters of <hi>Indifferency,</hi> would raise such a tempest in the inward Region of the Soul, as would not be quickly cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. I understood, how I could enjoy no peace in it by checking it: and that in the carefull composure of it, rested my quiet: having not onely sufficiently learn'd, but experimentally felt, how there was in it either a <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall Feast</hi> to cheer me; or a <hi>cloud</hi> of <hi>Witnesses</hi> to condemn me. I conceived then how the <hi>Cure</hi> of a <hi>troubled Spirit</hi> was a receipt of high and precious consequence. It was my assiduate care therefore to remove all such subtile witnesses from within me,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:35958:15"/>
that might at the High-Court of Tryals condemn me: as for other <hi>Testates,</hi> they were the least of my fears: I knew how Conscience would prove my individuall Consort; I held it therefore dangerous to displease it, lest I should perish by it. This might seem to be of light weight in a temporizing skale: but it poized more hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vily in mine.</p>
               <p>My high obligations con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by Oath, and bound in, I must confess, with an inviolable tie of religious love, had so inseparably uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted my thoughts to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion of allegiance; as the serious and constant obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of it begun to have
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:35958:16"/>
that influence over me, as in the end it resolv'd to a Case of Conscience.</p>
               <p>Sundry Disputes with si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newy Arguments to decline my opinion were frequently entertain'd by me, during my several places of imprison<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but I apprehended all these two weak motives to alter my resolution, or lessen my affection to such an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable object of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty. Upon these pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>misses I conceive that if I should appeal even to those who are aptest to traduce me, or inveigh against that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy (mis-construed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacy) which appeared in me, they could not in skrewing their censures to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:35958:16"/>
the highest pin, interpret it otherwise then an errour of <hi>Love,</hi> but no <hi>love</hi> of <hi>Errour:</hi> being so integriously groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; as it admitted no alloy or mixture with By respects or self-interests; which is become such an Epidemicall Disease, as it has got gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally an influence over the whole World.</p>
               <p>But to return to you, my dear Sonnes, to whom and for whose benefit these my <hi>last Directions</hi> are addressed; Be it your care in the free in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of a private condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: or in what quality so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it shall please the Almighty One to rauke you; to mould your spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to that temper, as your
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:35958:17"/>
discreet carriage may free you from publick censure. Many eyes and many eares require cautious and preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive thoughts. The onely way to be secure, is not to be active in affairs of State. As for those who make it their practise to be <hi>Fishers</hi> in <hi>trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled waters;</hi> it were very strange for them who pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise that Trade long to gain by their purchase. Privacy, as it is the onely recluse of safety; if your hours in it be not well imployed, it may become as dangerous as a place of agency. Caves may be as proper for designes as Theaters for action. It is the mind that makes the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaker free, whether he be
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:35958:17"/>
residentiary in a <hi>Wildernesse</hi> or in the <hi>World.</hi> Be it your care to reserve a sickle for your own harvest. He cannot chuse but lay himself open to many dangers, who desires to have an Ore in every Boat: or too officiously to engage his person in others Concerns. Make your thoughts your own; and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al desires cannot redound to your prejudice. It is want of secrecy, and too much cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity that makes many Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Subjects, Bondmen by forfeiture of their liberty: and by their profuse tongues subject their heads under o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers girdles.</p>
               <p>I have been conscious herein my self, which moves
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:35958:18"/>
me to be more intentive to this Caution; the neglect whereof has brought so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny mens estates &amp; lives to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine. For the <hi>Liberty</hi> of a <hi>Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> as I hold it to be a <hi>brave</hi> but <hi>rare</hi> interest; so I should account him, if it were my fortune to live with him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy the title of so emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent a priviledge, who will not stick to engage that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the ear of a stranger. But let me not forget my self by insisting too amply on these observances: I shall now <hi>descend</hi> unto the second <hi>Motive,</hi> which not onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced but confirmed me in my resolution to Loyalty.</p>

               <p>IT has been my fortune to hear sundry persons as wel Spiritual as Secular to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large themselves by way of Argument upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: and some of these, to my knowledge, men of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular abilities: and in all the progress of their Disputes touching Legall and Lineall Soveraigntie, they positive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded for me; though the Arguments of <hi>Paraeus, Zuinglius, Buchanan,</hi> with sundry other Anti-Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiall Authors were fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently &amp; with much vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencie
<pb facs="tcp:35958:19"/>
alledged, pressed, and pursued: so as, even those who were of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Partie, pretending themselves convinced with soliditie of Argument, and strength of Reason, seemed wholly satisfied with those rational Assertions: though, indeed, their plausible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences proved to my self and others colourable disguises, meerly to catch and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent us; being afterwards, to expedite our dispatch, produced for evidence against us. But look not upon these Agents with a vindicative eye, as you tende my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Your Father has forgiven them, do you the like. He retaines a slight
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:35958:19"/>
memorie of <hi>his</hi> patience and dolorous passion, who forgave his own death: that cannot in the recollection of his own unworthiness, pass by all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities; nay, who with much composedness has not learned to smile upon the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronts and injuries he shall occasionally suffer in this life. I must confess, the first On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set or Encounter, before I became well schooled in the discipline of suffering, presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to my frailty sundrie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>separable difficulties: But custome and continuance has sweetned those disgusts; fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them, if seasonably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, and temperately di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, the soveraignest Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipts that the constitution
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:35958:20"/>
of man can partake: by sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting his will to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, whose inscrutable wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom far above the pitch of all humane apprehension, declares his infinity by sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning those sufferings, which an indulgent or innate love to our selves had so much imbittered. We cannot share in a Crown, if we have no part in the Cross. And bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed be his Name that has ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med my weakness with this resolution: preparing in me a mind no less ready to bear, then Justice was to inflict: my actions by Gods assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance shall in this approching hour of my suffering express it: though I shall appear slow in the elegancy or flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:35958:20"/>
of words (for I never profest my self an Orator:) neither, indeed, should I hold such a dresse suitable to any one going to his death. But to passe from these; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves me to look upon you, so long as it is permitted me to live with you; my tender zeal therefore of your future welfare enjoines me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend one particular to your care; which infinitely concerns you: that is, your choice of Company. Good Acquaintance will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove both your knowledge and demean: by your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing with these, you shall every day get by heart some new lesson, that may season and accommodate you.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:35958:21"/>
Whereas our debauched Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry (the greatest Impostor of youth) would by their so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety quickly deprave you. Now to apply a remedy to so dangerous and infectious a Malady, be tender of your honour; beware with whom you consort: Be known to many, but familiar with few. Wherein, above all things, make use of this <hi>Directory:</hi> it will prove highly useful to you in these relations of soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety. It was the observation of a <hi>Divine Moral;</hi> and well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves the attention of the pregnantest &amp; prudentest ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehension. Make ever choice of such for your companions, of whom you retain this grounded opinion, that you
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:35958:21"/>
have either hope to improve them, or be improved by them. The one, as they argue a fairer, docile and pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able disposition: So the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being indued with parts, may by degrees bring their attentive consorts to an high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er pitch of knowledge and moral Perfection. And great pity it is, that our youth, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the eminentest Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, should make so light an estimate of time: as to hold no Consorts fitter for their Concerns, nor corresponding with their tempers, then such who onely study a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less expence of time: making no other account of Hours, then Harbingers of pleasure: and as airy Lures to attract their light and liquorish appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:35958:22"/>
to prohibited delights. Be tender then, as you wish success in the world, or the continuance of my Blessing, or the Honour of the House from whence you came: and your own Reputation; the preservation whereof shall make you live in me now dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and raise you an honest Fame in mine Ashes. Fame is such a precious odour, as neither those who are in the highest rank can impair it without an impeachment to their Honour: so neither those of a lower condition can just<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nor conscientiously tender it, but it will send forth a fragrant breath upon the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server. Houses are but weak material structures, subject to breaches and decayes;
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:35958:22"/>
unless repaired and supported by the general approvement and repute of their enjoyers.</p>
               <p>I could challenge from many descents, but my thoughts have ever been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stranged from titular arro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance: holding onely <hi>Fame</hi> to be the strongest continuer of a <hi>Family:</hi> being born up with such an impregnable Arch, as it needed no groundling Butteresses to preserve it: nor any <hi>Secondaries</hi> to prevent an untimely ruine.</p>
               <p>It has been my fortune to make experience of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive <hi>stay</hi> which proved so unsteady, that if I should live many years (as now my short life is measured forth to a few houres) it would make me henceforth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:35958:23"/>
that cautionary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: Let not the Titles of consanguinity nor affinity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray any man into a prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial trust.</p>
               <p>Whence it was that I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served some Persons, no soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner advanced to places of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected greatness, then they put on the severe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of justice, pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to imitate the example of <hi>Titus Manlius,</hi> who in a case of Justice gave sentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his own Son. But I found those to be onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities; or politick sem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances: they would not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige themselves for their friends security. These differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed far from <hi>Themistocles</hi> opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, amicable candor and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution; who being request<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:35958:23"/>
to bear himself indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently in his censure: and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to his own to put on the face of rigour, answered; Be it far from me not to plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure my friends in all things.</p>
               <p>As for my addresses, they were so qualified in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to obedience, as they stooped not to any ones ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication nor assistance.</p>
               <p>Now <hi>Tom,</hi> as you are the immediate hope of my house: so be it your care to entertain no thought below your self. Your course has been hitherto approveable: enabled by generous educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion abroad: and imitable examples at home: those to adorn; these to compleat.</p>
               <p>Being thus grounded, set
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:35958:24"/>
your self to those tasks that may usefully improve you; and by degrees accomplish you. In private and retired hours consult with the <hi>dead;</hi> being the best means to make men wise: make devout Books your discreeet Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sorts: they will tell you what you are to doe without fear of censure. These will beget in you a contempt of that (the World I mean) which detracts most from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Seneca</hi> wisht for Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, whereto he was entirely dedicated, that as the face of the universall World comes into view, so that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>losophicall <hi>Idaea</hi> might be presented to us as a spectacle
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:35958:24"/>
most unlike unto the World. I am confident, <hi>Tom,</hi> it is the lowest of your scorn to suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer your thoughts to be depressed with inferiour ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Continue that reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; it will arme you against all Occurrents.</p>
               <p>In the carriage of publick affairs, my advice is that you appear cautious: Many by putting themselves upon numerous imployments have lost themselves: though in neighbourly offices to be modestly active, manifests signall arguments of piety. But in all concerns appeare just. This will beget you a good report among men; and acceptance before the throne of Grace. All Justice is
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:35958:25"/>
comprehended in this word Innocence, all injustice repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended. And if it were just to pronounce such a <hi>Sentence</hi> upon loyall <hi>Innocence,</hi> I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to above. The practice of this Divine Office will render you blamelesse in all: by measuring your self by others; others by your self; and in doing unto others, as you would have done unto your self: And to summe up your directions in brief, that they may be more impressive in your memory: Expresse your self moderate in argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of dispute, close in your counsels, and discreet in your discourse.</p>
               <p>As for your houres of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creation, let them never so
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:35958:25"/>
overtake you, as to make your thoughts strangers in what most concerns you. And make choice of suitable consorts in these. For though Precepts induce, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples draw: and more danger there is in a personal Example, then any doctrinal Motive: whence it is very observable, that those whom we intimately affect, have such attractive influence over us: as whether it be in the pursuit of pleasure or profit, we suffer our selves to be drawn therto by their choice, without much examination of the probability of the issue, whereto their assayes are directed. All men are taught to <hi>eschew evil,</hi> and to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:35958:26"/>
                  <hi>do good:</hi> and there are <hi>innate seeds</hi> in every pious disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion moving him to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servance of that direction: But the nature of things is such, that where a good man is joined with a bad, the bad is not bettered by the good, but the good corrupted by the bad. We may then truly conclude that this world is a dangerous <hi>Pest-house:</hi> and if men out of a natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire of conserving their health, and of avoiding what may indanger it, would be loth to enter into an house that is infected: much more are they to decline all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional wayes of infecting their <hi>inward house,</hi> much more precious because par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:35958:26"/>
of immortality. But I am hopefull that the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Gods grace second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with your constant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire devotion, will sufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly strengthen you against all such humane frailties, which either the pronenesse of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or the corruption of these times may suggest. The Lord prepare you to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain all occurrents, with patience &amp; che e fulness. To your Superiours lawfully set over you, pre sent your self in due obedience: and in all your actions acquit your self (for herein consists the hope and accomplishment of yo ur felicity) a faithfully instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Gods glory.</p>
               <p>Now one word to you,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:35958:27"/>
                  <hi>Harry,</hi> who though younger by course of nature, has been ever dear and near my heart since thine infancy. Thine innocence has here for a season been a sufferer with thy Father: but let it not grieve thee to partake with him who doth so truly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee: and whose Paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal hopes have been ever highly treasured in thee. Neither can I conceit other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise (having had such ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of thy natural to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness) but thou rejoycest in thy suffering upon such an occasion, and with so dear a friend. But I hope it will not hold consistent with the prudence nor justice of this State, that a Fathers
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:35958:27"/>
guilt should by way of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment descend in a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. I shall sacrifice my life freely, as one, subject to an <hi>assumed</hi> authority: be it their goodness to spare inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence: though I should in my loyal thoughts hold such a Present a precious Pledge in relation to a just Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty, and a subjects duty. But I hope, my blood may sufficiently expiate the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of my crime, if it were greater, without farther re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge.</p>
               <p>The fortunes left you by the assistance of our friendly Trustees (for I have been long time a stranger to mine own) may by Gods providence appear compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:35958:28"/>
for a younger brother: Sure I am, it is all I can do for you. Be it your care by honest wayes to improve them; at least to preserve them; which is good hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry in these dayes. In a word, if your estate be not sufficient for you; be sufficient for your E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state. This was the advice of a wise Statist, observe it.</p>
               <p>Return my blessing to your Sister my dear <hi>Bab:</hi> and tell her from a dying Father, that she needs no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther example then her ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Mother for her Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory: in whose steps, I am confident, she will walk reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously. Her modest and
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:35958:28"/>
blameless demean can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise nothing less.</p>
               <p>And now my <hi>Dear ones,</hi> as my desire is that you should in this <hi>last Legacy</hi> of my <hi>Love</hi> and Parental duty remember me; so my request is that neither you nor any of my Relations suffer that memory they retain of me to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate grief. After a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome voyage encountred with many cross winds and adverse billows, I am now arriving in a safe Harbor: and I hope without touch of dishonour. As for death, though it appear terrible to all flesh; I have long ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected it, and by a consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious consequence prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:35958:29"/>
me for it. And to make it more familiar to me; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I was call'd up to this City, I made my <hi>Coffin</hi> my <hi>Companion;</hi> that I might with more resolution looke Death in the face, whenso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it should assault me.

               <p>My peace I hope is made with God: having in those solitary houres of my retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made this my constant Ejaculation: O, how can we chuse but begin to love him whom we have offended? or how should we but begin to grieve that we have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended him whom we love?

This was the solace of my choice, which through Gods goodnesse shall admit no change: and with this will I end, drawing now towards my end.</p>

BEing now to put off my Garment of Mortality, in assured hope to exchange it with the White Robe of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall glory.</p>
               <p>In this my farewell to Earth, it is my fervorous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to <hi>bequeath</hi> these my <hi>last Addresses</hi> to you, the <hi>dearest Pledges</hi> I had upon Earth.</p>
               <p>Draw near me, and heare those last words which I must ever on earth speak to you. Sure I am, that the dying words of an affectionate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, cannot but fasten dee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and retaine a memory longer, then the speech of the movingest Orator.</p>
               <p>Fear God above all things; it is the <hi>beginning of wisdom:</hi> and will enrich you above
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:35958:31"/>
your Portion. You are now in the <hi>ripening progresse</hi> of your Time: and entring the <hi>first Lists</hi> of your Youth, wherein you are here sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with numerous <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary tryals;</hi> let good compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny seconded with the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of piety season you: so shall <hi>his</hi> blessing, who hath blessed me with constancy in suffering, crown you.</p>
               <p>Be honest in your wayes; spare in your words; plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous in good workes. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions God hath given you, portions by Gods pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence (though lessened by these occasionall overtures) I have left you; enrich these with the best portion, the ornament of Vertue.</p>

Specious features are not to be valued to the precious embellishment of that <hi>inward beauty,</hi> which accomplisheth a Divine Soul.</p>
               <p>Be what you seem to be; and seem what you ought to be: I never loved that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise much, and perform no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Reality is the onely <hi>Cognizance</hi> of a good <hi>Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ever reslect on him that made you: and make <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion</hi> your constant <hi>Diary</hi> to conduct you.</p>
               <p>Be tender of those you rank with; either to better them, or to be bettered by them. Dead Flyes corrupt the preciousest Ointments.
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:35958:32"/>
Be humble to all; Humility is the way to Glory: this it is will make you amiable to the Creature; glorious in the sight of your Creator.</p>
               <p>Learne how to obey, that you may know better how to command.</p>
               <p>In the consideration of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane felicity, there is nothing becomes more incurable, then what is habituate: when custome of sin takes away all sense of sin. Old sores re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire long cures.</p>
               <p>Reserve Divine thoughts for sanctified roomes: In <hi>holy places</hi> is the Devil ever busiest.</p>
               <p>No disease more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous then the Lethargy of sin. This sleep brings ever an
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:35958:33"/>
heavy awake: For though like a tender Nurse, she sing a sweet Lullabee to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded child, it is ever in worst case, the more it sleeps; for it dyes in sins-slumber, and perisheth untimely by the blandishment of her Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Consider this, my dearest Ones. <hi>Resist the Devil, and he will fly from you:</hi> Suffer not the first motions of sin to seize on you. <hi>Pray conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually,</hi> because you have an enemy assayling you inces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>santly: the Combat is short, your Crown eternall.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>heat</hi> of the <hi>day,</hi> think of the <hi>Evening:</hi> The <hi>earnest-penny</hi> wil recompence your pains: Continue to the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:35958:33"/>
end, and your reward shall be endless.</p>
               <p>Be not too curious in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring what you are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive after this life; but so labour that you may receive your reward of glory after this life. Many, by too cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious an itching after what there were to receive, have deceived themselves, by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their Reward more then God.</p>
               <p>Let nothing on earth take your hearts; Let the Divine Love onely possess them, so shall you find quietness in them.</p>
               <p>That heart cannot want, that possesseth God. He will be a light to direct it, that it stray not: A <hi>comfort</hi> to refresh
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:35958:34"/>
it, that it faile not. For all earthly helps, they must ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leave us, or we them. Wherein it faleth often-tims forth, that we are most af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted even in those, wherein we expected most comfort.</p>
               <p>It is one thing to live on Earth, another thing to love Earth. To be in the World, and of the World, are diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent conditions. <hi>Tabernacles</hi> are not to be accounted <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations.</hi> While we are so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journing, we must be jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neying towards <hi>Canaan:</hi> nor may we rest till we get home.</p>
               <p>O my tender Ones (for never were children more dear to a Father) make eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:35958:34"/>
day of your life a promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing passage to your native Countrey. As every day brings you nearer your grave, may every day increase in you the richness of his grace.</p>
               <p>Let the joyes of Heaven and torments of Hell be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar with you; by medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating of the felicity of the one, and infelicity of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; these to deter, those to allure.</p>
               <p>Be not too much taken with Fashion; it is the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease of this age: Comeliness is the most taking dresse to a discreet eye; whatsoever is else, <hi>borders</hi> on sin, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes reputations stain.</p>
               <p>I am not now very old, when this <hi>Judicial Sentence</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:35958:35"/>
has enjoyned me to leave you, yet never did that <hi>sprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vanity</hi> of the Time much surprize me.</p>
               <p>For my part, I did ever rather affect not to be known at all, then to be known for Singular. It is a poor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishment that takes her essence from what we wear. The Rinde makes not the Tree precious, but the Fruit.</p>
               <p>Neither speak I this to excuse my frailties. I confess my diversions have been ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; but through my hearty Conversion and unfeigned Contrition, by the merits of my Saviour, I hope, my peace is made.</p>
               <p>Now to continue my <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Bequest,</hi> My desire is, that
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:35958:35"/>
you would be circumspect in your discourse. Though no <hi>Society</hi> can subsist without <hi>Speech,</hi> yet were it very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to be cautious of the Society to whom we direct our Speech. I may experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally speak it, having so highly suffered by it. Few or none have ever been hurt by silence; but many, too many by too prodigal speech have engaged their freedom to the power of their Foes: varnished over with the spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretences of Friends.</p>
               <p>Let your whole <hi>Life</hi> be a <hi>Line</hi> of <hi>direction</hi> to your selves; and of <hi>instruction</hi> to others.</p>
               <p>Be more ready to <hi>heare</hi> then to <hi>teach;</hi> and above all
<pb facs="tcp:35958:36"/>
things, let your Famebe a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Doctrine to your family.</p>
               <p>Be diligent in the <hi>vocation</hi> or <hi>imployment</hi> you are called unto: and be ever doing some good work: that the devil may never find you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employed: for our <hi>Security</hi> is his <hi>Opportunity;</hi> to prevent his sleights, give no way to sloth.</p>
               <p>When you come into any <hi>Holy place,</hi> call him to mind, to whom it is dedicated. Hold your selves then as retired from the world: and lift up your hearts to Him, who is your Hope and Helpe, both here and in a better world.</p>
               <p>Esteem of all men well; and of your selves the worst.</p>
               <p>Suffer with others, when you shal hear them desamed:
<pb facs="tcp:35958:36"/>
and preserve their report as well as you may. For it is not sufficient to be tender of our own, and impeach others: but to tender others as our own.</p>
               <p>Stand alwayes in an hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and religious fear.</p>
               <p>Be not ashamed to confess, what you were not ashamed to commit.</p>
               <p>If at any time, through frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, you fail; with tears of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned contrition redeem your fall.</p>
               <p>Walk with an undefiled Conscience; knowing that you are in his presence, whose eyes are so pute, as they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not abide miquity; and whose judgment so cleer, as it will search out hypocrisie.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:35958:37"/>
Keep your bodies undefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; Temples should be pure and unpolluted.</p>
               <p>If your desire be to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour your Maker, you must make your heart his Harbor.</p>
               <p>Every Countrey hath one chief City; and that situate in the Heart of the Land; and becomes the Kings Seat. Your heart shall be the City of the King of Kings, so you guard the gates of your <hi>little City,</hi> that no sinful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder nor usurping designer enter nor surprize them; no corrupt affection win in upon them.</p>
               <p>Now the better to secure your State; let your eyes your City-Centinels, be so directed, that they become
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:35958:37"/>
not distracted: by wandring abroad, they beget disorder at home.</p>
               <p>All neighbourly offices I commend unto you; they gain love, which is the oyl of our life. But too much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity I do not admit; <hi>Charity</hi> is expedient to all, <hi>Familiarity</hi> to few.</p>
               <p>Cherish <hi>Affability,</hi> there is nothing that purchaseth more love with less cost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Friendship</hi> is properly term'd the <hi>Fruit</hi> of <hi>virtue;</hi> without which ground it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes an unripe fruit, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth its kernel.</p>
               <p>Prefer <hi>restraint</hi> of the <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy</hi> before that of the <hi>Mind;</hi> there can be no true free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, so long as the Soul
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:35958:38"/>
is liable to thraldome.</p>
               <p>I have been known to <hi>sundry Holds;</hi> yet I found my infranchized mind, when I was most estranged from enjoyment of liberty, to be the freest enjoyer of it self.</p>
               <p>Hold nothing comparable to the estimate of a clear Conscience; a <hi>continual Feast</hi> admits no competition with a <hi>Cloud</hi> of impeaching Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses. This hath been my Anchor hold to secure my Vessel.</p>
               <p>The terrours of Death are but objects to the eye; with a momentany sense of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pain to the body: whereas if the Soul through the gusts of a restlesse Conscience,
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:35958:38"/>
grapple with death; and gives up her hold, her sufferings are to eternity. A short storm should not discourage us, when we are within the ken of our Harbour.</p>
               <p>Prosperity is a fair gail; but the memory of it rather afflicts then refresheth us; when our security has thrown us upon a shelf, before we come a-shore.</p>
               <p>If earthly enjoyments had seiz'd on me; my death might have prov'd more Natural, but through those <hi>Preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> wherewith Gods good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness hath furnished me, perchance not so welcom.</p>
               <p>I am now to put off that which troubled me most; to become clothed with his
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:35958:39"/>
                  <hi>righteousness,</hi> whose All<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency has pleaded my cause.</p>
               <p>In my Period to these; and to order your course the better in the Current and Progression of your affairs: Let not the Sun shine upon you, before you have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended your selves to that <hi>Son of Righteousness,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you in all your wayes; and inrich you with all good works.</p>
               <p>To conclude, (for I feel my failing Faculties, through continuance of my long re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint, and late necessary ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses, drawing near their conclusion;) Let your <hi>youth</hi> be so seasoned with all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, that in your <hi>riper age,</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:35958:39"/>
you may retain an habit of that which your <hi>youth</hi> pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised.</p>
               <p>Well-spent Minutes are precious treasures; whose reviving memory in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of what we ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered by them, will refresh your fainting Soules in their sharpest gusts of humane frailty.</p>
               <p>To speak of <hi>Marriage</hi> to you, I will not; onely this, let a religious fear accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny those acquiescences: wherein, I conceive a parity in descent, a competency of Fortune, but principally our harmony in a religious profession may conduce high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to your future comfort: and remove those occasional
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:35958:40"/>
discontents, which a failing in any of these too usually procures: which completed, may your Choice thus equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tempered with discretion and affection admit no change: so shall a pious e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation in your succeeding Relations second your choice.</p>
               <p>Prefer your <hi>Fame</hi> before all <hi>Fortunes:</hi> it is that sweet Odour which will perfume you living, and embalm you dying.</p>
               <p>I find my self now, through the apprehension of my approching Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which I shall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain with a cheerful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance, breathing home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: the eye of my body

is fixt on you; the eye of my soul on Heaven: Think on me as your Natural Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and of Earth as your Common Mother. Thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther am I going, where by course of Nature, though not in the same manner, you must follow.</p>

I shall acquaint you briefly (for no long time must be now permitted me,) in these my <hi>last lines:</hi> as the definite Sentence of death pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon me, has sufficiently assur'd me.</p>
               <p>Some short time after my commitment, Mr. <hi>Mordant,</hi> Dr. <hi>Hewit,</hi> and my <hi>self</hi> were ordered to appear before the <hi>High-Court of Justice</hi> at <hi>Westminster:</hi> where we stood indicted of <hi>High-Treason:</hi> and where Mr. <hi>Mordant</hi> by his discreet carriage, and singular preparation, seconded with the fair acquiescence of the <hi>President,</hi> after a long and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious examination of his cause, became acquitted.

Though it has been reported since the time of his impeachment, that upon maturer advice of such as by a more peculiar <hi>relation</hi> had an influence over him, he could have been contented
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:35958:44"/>
to submit to a trial: and that petitions were presented to that purpose, but through some <hi>titular</hi> defect or other, he might not be admitted to that favour. Howsoever, I am very confident, that this <hi>Gentleman</hi> was so conscienci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in all his actions: and so confirm'd in his <hi>profest zeal,</hi> as he would entertain nothing below himself.</p>
               <p>High and of weighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence were the Articles that were drawn up against me: and these laid to my charge with much vehemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Especially my conference with some persons at <hi>Hulb;</hi> which I conceived (as I then told them) to be rather a se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular discourse; and such so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciable
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:35958:44"/>
chat, as it might be in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny equall judgme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, held soo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner for a <hi>jest,</hi> then a design of State. Whereto the <hi>Attourney</hi> was pleased to make answer <hi>facetiously</hi> according to his u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sual manner, and with much punctuality: That he never heard in all his time, that <hi>trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi> was held a <hi>jest.</hi> And then with a <hi>supercilious smile</hi> turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himself towards me: Sir <hi>Harry,</hi> said he, you have jested your self fairly out of your Fame, Estate, and now accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the merit of your cause very like to jest your self into a grave to your laft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dishonour. I insisted not much upon defence nor vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of mine innocence; for I understood, it was effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:35958:45"/>
Those Persons who were my accusers, were for time, place, and every cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance, such convincing evidence, (besides their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal prevalency in the eye of that Court) as my reply in what tenor soever would have prov'd fruitless: and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther not heard at all, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to my disadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage: The onely <hi>Guard,</hi> then, that I stood upon, was <hi>Silence</hi> and <hi>Patience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though as the case stood in my particular, I could not hold those <hi>Persons</hi> my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petible Accusers: nor well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving estimatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in that high Court; being such, as their compliance (had not probable hopes of preferment divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:35958:45"/>
them) could have consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enciously closed with my Principles: but the <hi>fears</hi> of <hi>danger,</hi> and the hopes of <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour;</hi> were in the <hi>first</hi> such <hi>determents;</hi> and in the <hi>later,</hi> such inducements; as they begot in them an indifferency in the one: and a resolution for the other.</p>
               <p>I would not willingly give you a trouble, as I shall not to the world long. The Court, upon the evidence given, adjudged me to die: but by Petition and the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectors</hi> clemency: not in that dishonourable manner, as we were sentenced. So as my resolved Soul, now in the merits of Christ, is winging her flight for Heaven. My
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:35958:46"/>
                  <hi>preparation</hi> becomes freer from distraction, by the gentile demean and civilities of our <hi>Lieutenant:</hi> and by his command, of the Souldiers modest carriage towards us, in our private devotions, and other holy Duties. Which <hi>pious Office,</hi> as it conduceth much to our peace, so it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but redound highly to the <hi>Commanders</hi> honour. Compassion in places of Command, where Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may be executed without controul, deserves, for the <hi>rarity</hi> of it, an eminent At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute.</p>
               <p>Dear Sir, He begs at your hands the assistance of your Prayers, who, as in his Life, so now at his Death, in the
