            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>U</hi>PON the coming abroad of Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s <hi>Problemata Phyſica,</hi> finding them in the hands of an Ingenious Perſon, that intended to write a Cenſure of them, which ſeveral Employments private and publick have, it ſeems, hinder'd him to do; I began, as is uſual on ſuch occaſions, to turn over the leaves of the Book, to ſee what particular things it treated of. This I had not long done before I found, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious paſſages in the <hi>third</hi> Chapter, or Dialogue, as well as by the Title, which was <hi>Problemata de Vacuo,</hi> that I was particularly concern'd in it; upon which I deſired the Poſſeſſor of the Book, who readily conſented, to leave me to examin that <hi>Dialogue,</hi> on which condition I would leave him to deal with all the reſt of the Book. Nor did I look upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections I meant to make as repugnant
<pb facs="tcp:48183:3"/>
to the Reſolutions I had taken againſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Books of Controverſie, ſince the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> gave of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems, ſeem'd to contain but ſome Varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of, or an Appendix to, his Tract <hi>De Natura Aeris,</hi> which, being one of the two firſt pieces that were publiſhed againſt what I had written, was one of thoſe that I had expreſly reſerv'd my ſelf the liberty to anſwer. But the <hi>Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions</hi> I firſt made upon Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s <hi>Problems De Vacuo,</hi> having been caſually miſlaid e're they were finiſhed; before I had occaſion to reſume my task, there paſt time enough to let me perceive, that his Doctrine, which 'twill eaſily be thought that the <hi>Vacuiſts</hi> diſapproved, was not much reliſhed by moſt of the <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts</hi> themſelves, the moderneſt <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teticks</hi> and the <hi>Carteſians;</hi> each of them maintaining the <hi>Fullneſs</hi> of the World, upon their own grounds, which are differing enough from thoſe of our Author, the natural Indiſpoſition I have to Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Diſcourſes, eaſily perſwaded me to let alone a Controverſie, that did not appear needful: And I had ſtill perſiſted
<pb facs="tcp:48183:3"/>
in my ſilence, if Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> had not as 'twere ſummon'd me to break it by publiſhing again his <hi>Explications,</hi> which in my <hi>Examen</hi> of his Dialogue <hi>De Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura Aeris</hi> I had ſhewn to be erroneous.</p>
            <p>And I did not grow at all more ſatisfied, to find him ſo conſtant as well as ſtiff an Adverſary to <hi>interſpers'd Vacuities,</hi> by comparing what he maintains in his Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue <hi>De Vacuo,</hi> with ſome things that he teaches, eſpecially concerning God, the Cauſe of Motion, and the Imperviouſneſs of Glaſs, in ſome other of his writings that are publiſhed in the ſame Volume with it. For ſince he aſſerts that there is a God, and owns Him to be the Creator of the World; and ſince on the other ſide the Penetration of Dimenſions is confeſſed to be impoſſible, and he denies that there is any <hi>Vacuum</hi> in the Univerſe; it ſeems difficult to conceive, how in a World that is already perfectly full of Bodie, a <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal</hi> Deity, ſuch as he maintains in his <hi>Append. ad Leviath. cap. 3,</hi> can have that acceſs even to the minute parts of the Mundane Matter, that ſeems requi<gap reason="illegible: faint" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſite to the Attributes and Operations that
<pb facs="tcp:48183:4"/>
belong to the Deity, in reference to the World. But I leave Divines to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what Influence the conjunction of Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s two Opinions, the Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reity of the Deity, and the perfect Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the World, may have on Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy. And perhaps I ſhould not in a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Diſcourſe have taken any notice of the propoſed Difficulty, but that, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent an Imputation on the Study of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures Works, (as if it taught us rather to degrade than admire their Author,) it ſeem'd not amiſs to hint <hi>(in tranſitu)</hi> that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s groſs Conteption of a Corporeal God, is not only unwarranted by <hi>found</hi> Philoſophy, but ill befriended even by <hi>his own.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>My Adverſary having propos'd his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems by way of <hi>Dialogue</hi> between <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B;</hi> 'twill not, I preſume, be wonder'd at, that I have given the ſame form to my Animadverſions; which come forth no earlier, becauſe I had divers other Treatiſes, that I was more concern'd for, to publiſh before them.</p>
            <p>But becauſe it will probably be deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, why on a Tract that is but ſhort,
<pb facs="tcp:48183:4"/>
my Animadverſions ſhould take up ſo much room? It will be requiſite, that I here give an account of the bulk of this Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> having found that there was not any one Problem, in whoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, as propos'd by Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> I ſaw cauſe to acquieſce, I was induc'd for the Readers eaſe, and that I might be ſure to do my Adverſary no wrong, to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe his whole Dialogue, bating ſome few Tranſitions, and other Clauſes not needful to be transferr'd hither.</p>

               </note>Next, I was not willing to imitate Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> who recites in the Dialogue we are conſidering the ſame Experiments that he had already mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in his Tract <hi>De Natura Aeris,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out adding as his own (that I remember) any <hi>new</hi> one to them. But my unwillingneſs to tire the Reader with
<pb facs="tcp:48183:5"/>
bare Repetitions of the Arguments I employ'd in my <hi>Examen</hi> of that Tract, invited me to endeavour to make him ſome amends for the exerciſe of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience by inſerting, as occaſion was offer'd, five or ſix new Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments, that will not perhaps be ſo eaſily made by every Reader that will be able (now that I have perſpicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly propos'd them) to underſtand them.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, ſince Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> has not been content to mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie himſelf and his way of treating of Phyſical matters, but has been pleas'd to ſpeak very ſlighting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Experimentarian Philoſophers (as he
<pb facs="tcp:48183:5"/>
ſtiles them) in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and, which is worſe, to diſparage the making of elaborate Experiments; I judg'd the thing, he ſeem'd to aim at, ſo prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to true and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Philoſophy, that I thought, it might do ſome ſervice to the leſs knowing, and leſs wary, ſort of Readers, if I tryed to make his own Explications ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate his Authority, and by a ſomewhat particular <hi>Examen</hi> of the Solutions he has given of the Problems I am concern'd in, ſhew, that 'tis much more eaſie to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue a frequent recourſe to Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, than truly to explicate the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena</hi> of Nature without them.

And though I would not intereſs the credit of Experimentarian Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers in no conſiderabler a Paper than this; yet if Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s Explications and mine be attentively compared, it will not, I hope, by them be found, that the way of Philoſophiſing he employs, is much to be preferr'd before that which he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>values.</p>

this Dialogue of Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> have cogently proved his, and the Schools, Aſſertion, <hi>Non dari Vacuum;</hi> and <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> he has rightly explain'd ſome Phaenomena of Nature which he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakes to give an account of, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially ſome produced in our Engin, whereof he takes upon him to render the genuine Cauſes.

               <p>You do not miſtake my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therefore without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Preamble, let us now proceed to the particular Phaenomena conſider'd by Mr. <hi>Hobbes;</hi> the firſt of which is an Experiment propoſed by me in the

one and thirtieth of the <hi>Phyſico-Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanical Experiments</hi> concerning the Adheſion of two flat and poliſh'd Marbles, which I endeavour'd to ſolve by the preſſure of the Air. And this Experiment Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> thinks ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing an one to prove the Plenitude of the World, that, though he tells us he has many cogent Arguments to make it out, yet he mentions but this one, becauſe that, <hi>he ſays,</hi> ſuffices.</p>

               <p>The Confidence he thereby expreſſes of the great force of this Argument does the leſs move me, becauſe, I remember, that formerly in his <hi>Elements of Philoſophy</hi> he thought it ſufficient to employ one Argument to evince the Plenitude of the World, and for that one he pitch'd upon the Vulgar Experiment of a Gardeners Watering-Pot: But, whether he were wrought upon by the Objections made to his Inference from that Phaenome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non in your Examen of his Dialogue <hi>De Natura Aeris,</hi> or by ſome other Conſiderations, I will not pretend to divine. But I plainly perceive, he

now prefers the Experiment of the cohering Marbles.</p>

               <p>And firſt, without declaring for the <hi>Vacuiſts</hi> Opinion, I muſt profeſs my ſelf unſatisfied with Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s way of arguing againſt them: For, where he ſays, <hi>Dum ergo illi qui Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor unum ab altero revellentes Aerem comprimunt &amp; per conſequens Vacuum exprimunt, Vacuum faciunt locum per revulſionem relictum; nulla ergo ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis erit difficultas, ſaltem non major quàm eſt difficultas corpora eadem mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vendi in Aere poſtquam ſeparata fuerint. Itaque quoniam, conceſſo Vacuo, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultas Marmora illa dirimendi nulla eſt, ſequitur per difficultatis experientiam, nullum eſſe Vacuum.</hi> Methinks he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes himſelf but obſcurely, and leaves his Readers to gheſs, what the word <hi>Dum</hi> refers to. But that which ſeems to be his drift in this paſſage, is, that, ſince the <hi>Vacuiſts</hi> allow inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperſed Vacuities, not only in the Air
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48183:11"/>
that ſurrounds the conjoyned Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, but in the reſt of the ambient Air, there is no reaſon, why there ſhould be any difficulty in ſeparating the Marbles, or at leaſt any greater difficulty than in moving the Marbles in that Air after their ſeparation. But, not to conſider, whether his Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries will not accuſe his phraſe of <hi>ſqueezing out a Vacuum</hi> as if it were a Body, they will eaſily anſwer, that notwithſtanding the Vacuities they admit in the ambient Air, a manifeſt reaſon may be given in their Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis of our finding a difficulty in the Divulſion of the Marbles. For, the Vacuities they admit being but inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers'd, and very ſmall, and the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles of the Atmoſphere being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them endow'd with Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, there leans ſo many upon the upper ſurface of the uppermoſt Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that that ſtone cannot be at once perpendicularly drawn up from the lower Marble contiguous to it, without a force capable to ſurmount the weight of the Aerial Corpuſcles
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:48183:12"/>
that lean upon it. And this weight has already ſo conſtipated the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts of the ambient Air, that he, that would perpendicularly raiſe the upper Marble from the lower, ſhall need a conſiderable force to make the Revulſion, and compel the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready contiguous parts of the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent Air to a ſubingreſſion into the pores or intervals intercepted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them. For the <hi>Conatus</hi> of him, that endeavours to remove the upper Marble, whilſt the lower ſurface of it is fenc'd from the preſſure of the Atmoſphere by the Contact of the lower Marble which ſuffers no Air to come in between them, is not aſſiſted by the weight or preſſure of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere, which, when the Marbles are once ſeparated, preſſing as ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the undermoſt ſurface of the upper Marble, as the incumbent Atmoſpherical Pillar does againſt the upper ſurface of the ſame Marble, the hand that endeavours to raiſe it in the free Air has no other reſiſtance, than that ſmall one of the Marbles own weight to ſurmount.</p>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48183:13"/>

And a <hi>Vacuiſt</hi> may tell you, that, provided the ſtrength employ'd to draw up the ſuperiour Marble be great enough to ſurmount the weight of the Aerial Corpuſcles accumulated upon it, the divulſion would enſue, though by Divine Omnipotence no

Air or other Body ſhould be permitted to fill the room made for it by the divulſion; and that the Air's ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing into that ſpace does not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily accompany, but in order of Nature and time follow upon, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the Marbles, the Air that ſurrounded their contiguous ſurfaces being by the weight of the collate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuperiour Air impell'd into the room newly made by the divulſion.

come to ruſh in, to poſſeſs the place given it by the receſs of the upper Marble, whoſe very eaſie avulſion is as eaſily explicable by our Hypotheſis; ſince the preſſure of that little Air, that remain'd in the Receiver, being too faint to make any at all conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable reſiſtance to the avulſion of the upper Marble, the hand that drew it up had very little more than the ſingle weight of the ſtone to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount.</p>

               <p>And <hi>firſt,</hi> whereas Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to the Divulſion of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles a force great enough to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount the hardneſs of the ſtone, this is aſſerted <hi>gratis,</hi> which it ſhould not be; ſince it ſeems very unlikely, that the weight of ſo few pounds as will ſuffice to ſeparate two coherent Marbles of about an Inch, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in Diameter, ſhould be able to ſurmount the hardneſs of ſuch ſolid

ſtones as we uſually employ in this Experiment.

<pb n="19" facs="tcp:48183:15"/>
gives of our Phaenomenon by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſunder the oppoſite parts of a piece of Wax?</p>

               <p>To me it ſeems an Inſtance improper enough. For <hi>firſt,</hi> the parts that are to be divided in the Wax are of a ſoft and yielding conſiſtence, and according to him of a ductile, or, if you pleaſe, of a tractile na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and not, as the parts of the coherent Marbles, very ſolid and hard. <hi>Next,</hi> the parts of the Wax do not ſtick together barely by a ſuperficial contact of two ſmooth Planes, as do the Marbles we are ſpeaking of; but have their parts implicated, and as it were intangled with one another. And therefore they are far from a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to ſlide off, like the Marbles, from one another, in how commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious a poſture ſoever you place them. Beſides 'tis manifeſt, that the Air has opportunity to ſucceed in the places ſucceſſively deſerted by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding parts of the attenuated Wax; but 'tis neither manifeſt, nor as yet well proved by Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> that the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48183:16"/>
Air does after the ſame manner ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed between the two Marbles, which, as I lately noted, are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced aſunder after ſuch a way, but are, as himſelf ſpeaks, ſever'd in all their points at the ſame inſtant.</p>

               <p>You may remember, that where I relate that Experiment, I expreſs'd a hope, that, when I ſhould be better accommodated than I then was, I might attempt the Tryal with proſperous ſucceſs, and accordingly afterwards, having got a leſſer En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine than that I uſed before, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Air might be better pumpt out and longer kept out, I cheerfully repeated the Tryal. To ſhew then,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:48183:17"/>
that when two coherent Marbles are ſuſtained horizontally in the Air, the Cauſe, why they are not to be forc'd aſunder, if they have two or three Inches in Diameter, without the help of a conſiderable weight, is the preſſure I was lately mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ambient Air; I cauſed two ſuch coherent Marbles to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in a large Receiver, with a weight at the lowermoſt, that might help to keep them ſteddy, but was very inconſiderable to that which their Coheſion might have ſurmoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; then cauſing the Air to be pumpt by degrees out of the Recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, for a good while the Marbles ſtuck cloſe together, becauſe during that time the Air could not be ſo far pumpt out, but that there remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned enough to ſuſtain the ſmall weight that endeavoured their divul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: But when the Air was further pumpt out, at length the Spring of the little, but not a little expanded, Air, that remained, being grown too weak to ſuſtain the lower Marble

               <p>I never envied Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s forwardneſs to triumph, and am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, his Conjectures be recommended by the confidence that accompanies them, if mine be by the ſucceſs that follows them. But to confirm the Explication given by me of our Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon, I ſhall add, that as the laſt mention'd Tryal, which I had ſeveral times occaſion to repeat, ſhews, that the coheſion of our two contiguous Marbles would ceaſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the withdrawing of the preſſure of the Atmoſphere; ſo by another Experiment I made, it appears, that the ſupervening of that preſſure ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to cauſe that Coheſion. For, in proſecution of one of the lately mentioned Tryals, having found, that when the Receiver was well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, two Marbles, though con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably broad, being laid upon one
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48183:18"/>
another after the requiſite manner, their adheſion was, if any at all, ſo weak, that the uppermoſt would be eaſily drawn up from off the other; we laid them again one upon the other, and then letting the external Air flow into the Receiver, we found, according to expectation, that the Marbles now cohered well, and we could not raiſe the uppermoſt but accompanied with the lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt. But I am ſenſible, I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained you too long upon the ſingle Experiment of the Marbles: And though I hope the ſtreſs Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> lays on it will plead my excuſe, yet to make your Patience ſome amends, I ſhall be the more brief in the other particulars that remain to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd in his Dialogue <hi>De Vacuo.</hi> And 'twill not be difficult for me to keep my promiſe without injuring my Cauſe, ſince almoſt all theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars being but the ſame which he has already alledged in his Dialogue <hi>De Natura Aeris,</hi> and I ſoon after an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered in my <hi>Examen</hi> of that Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,

               <p>Stop here, I beſeech you, a little, that, before we go any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I may take notice to you of a couple of things that will concern our ſubſequent Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Whereof the <hi>firſt</hi> is, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by Mr. <hi>Hobbes's Dialogue about the Air,</hi> that the Explications he there gave of ſome of the Phaenomena of the <hi>Machina Boyliana,</hi> were directed partly againſt the <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> that have ſince been honour'd with the Title
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48183:19"/>
of the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> and partly againſt the Author of that Engine, as if the main thing therein deſign'd were to prove a <hi>Vacuum.</hi> And ſince he now repeats the ſame explications, I think it neceſſary to ſay again, that if he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther takes the <hi>Society</hi> or me for profeſs'd <hi>Vacuiſts,</hi> he miſtakes, and ſhoots be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide the mark; for, neither they nor I have ever yet declar'd either <hi>for</hi> or <hi>againſt</hi> a <hi>Vacuum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the <hi>other</hi> thing I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to you, is, that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> ſeems not to have rightly underſtood, or at leaſt not to have ſufficiently heeded in what chiefly conſiſts the advantage, which the <hi>Vacuiſts</hi> may make of our Engine againſt him: For, whereas in divers places he is very ſolicitous to prove, that the cavity of our Pneumatical Receiver is not altogether empty, the Vacuiſts may tell him, that ſince he aſſerts the <hi>abſolute</hi> plenitude of the World, he muſt, as indeed he does, reject not only great Vacuities, but alſo thoſe very ſmall and interſpers'd
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48183:20"/>
ones, that they ſuppoſe to be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted between the ſolid corpuſcles of other bodies, particularly of the Air: So that it would not confute them to prove, that in our Receiver, when moſt diligently exhauſted, there is not one great and abſolute Vacuity, or, as they ſpeak, a <hi>Vacuum coacervatum,</hi> ſince ſmaller and diſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated Vacuities would ſerve their turn. And therefore they may think their Pretenſions highly favour'd, as by ſeveral particular effects, ſo by this general Phaenomenon of our En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that it appears by ſeveral Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, that the Common or At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſpherical Air, which, before the pump is ſet a work, poſſeſs'd the whole cavity of our Receiver, far the greateſt part is by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of the pump made to paſs out of the cavity into the open Air, without being able, at leaſt for a little while, to get in again; and yet it does not appear by any thing alledg'd by Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> that any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther body ſucceeds to fill adequately
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48183:20"/>
the places deſerted by ſuch a multitude of Aerial corpuſcles.</p>

               <p>If I gheſs aright, by thoſe words, (viz. <hi>it appears not by any thing alledg'd by Mr.</hi> Hobbes,) you deſign to intimate, that you would not in general prejudice the Pleniſts.</p>

               <p>Your conjecture was well founded: For I think divers of them, and particularly the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> who ſuppoſe a ſubtile Matter or <hi>Aether</hi> fine enough to permeate glaſs, though our common Air cannot do it, have not near ſo difficult a task to avoid the Arguments the Vacuiſts may draw from our Engine, as Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> who, without having recourſe to the poroſity of glaſs, which indeed is impervious to <hi>common</hi> Air, ſtrives to ſolve the Phaenomena, and prove our Receiver to be always perfectly full, and therefore as full at any one time as at any other of common or Atmoſpherical Air, as far as we can judge of his opinion by the tendency or import of his Explications.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48183:21"/>
of an Experiment of yours, Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> may be thereby reduc'd either to paſs over to the <hi>Vacuiſts,</hi> or to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge ſome Aetherial or other matter more ſubtil than Air, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of paſſing through the pores of glaſs; and therefore, to ſhew your ſelf impartial between the Vacuiſts and their Adverſaries in this Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie, I hope you will not refuſe to gratifie the <hi>Pleniſts</hi> by giving your friends a more particular account of the Experiment.</p>

               <p>I know which you mean, and remember it very well. For, though I long ſince devis'd it, yet having but the other day had occaſion to peruſe the Relation I writ down of one of the beſt Tryals, I think I can repeat it, almoſt in the very words, which, if I miſtake not, were theſe:</p>
               <p>There was taken a Bubble of thin white glaſs, about the bigneſs of a Nutmeg, with a very ſlender ſtem, of about four or five Inches long, and of the bigneſs of a Crows-quill.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48183:21"/>
The end of the Quill being held in the flame of a Lamp blown with a pair of Bellows, was readily and well ſeal'd up, and preſently the globous part of the glaſs, being held by the ſtem, was kept turning in the flame, 'till it was red hot and ready to melt; then being a little removed from the flame, as the included Air be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to loſe of its agitation and ſpring, the external Air manifeſtly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably preſs'd in one of the ſides of the Bubble. But the glaſs being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, before the cold could crack it, held as before in the flame, the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Air diſtended and plump'd up the Bubble; which being the ſecond time remov'd from the flame, was the ſecond time compreſs'd; and, being the third time brought back to the flame, ſwell'd as before, and remov'd, was again compreſs'd, (ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this time or the laſt by two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct cavities;) 'till at length, having ſatisfied our ſelves, that the included Air was capable of being condens'd or dilated without the ingreſs or
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48183:22"/>
egreſs of Air (properly ſo called) we held the Bubble ſo long in the flame, ſtrengthen'd by nimble blaſts, that not only it had its ſides plump'd up, but a hole violently broken in it by the over-rarified Air, which, together with the former watchful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, we imploy'd from time to time to diſcern if it were any where crackt or perforated, ſatisfied us that it was till then intire.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I confeſs, I did not readily conceive before, how you could, (as I was told you had,) make a ſolid Veſſel, wherein there was no danger of the Aires getting in or out, whoſe cavity ſhould be ſtill poſſeſt with the ſame Air, and yet the Veſſel be made by turns bigger and leſſer. And, though I preſently thought upon a well ſtopt bladder, yet I well foreſaw, that a diſtruſtful Adverſary might make ſome Objections, which are by your way of proceeding obviated, and the Experiment agrees with your Doctrine in ſhewing, how imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious we may well think your thick
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:48183:22"/>
Pneumatick Receivers are to common Air, ſince a thin glaſs Bubble, when its pores were open'd or relax'd by flame, would not give paſſage to the Springy particles of the Air, though violently agitated; for if thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles could have got out of the pores, they never would have broke the Bubble, as at length a more violent degree of Heat made them do; nor probably would the Compreſſion, that afterwards inſued of the Bubble by the ambient Air, be checkt near ſo ſoon, if thoſe Springy Corpuſcles had not remained within to make the reſiſtance. Methinks, one may hence draw a new proof of what I remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you elſewhere teach, that the Spring of the Air may be much ſtrengthen'd by Heat. For, in our caſe, the Spring of the Air was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by inabled to expand the compreſt glaſs, it was impriſon'd in, in ſpite of the reſiſting preſſure of the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Air; and yet, that this preſſure was conſiderable, appears by this, that the weight of ſo ſmall a Column
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:48183:23"/>
of Atmoſpherical Air, as could bear upon the Bubble, was able to preſs in the heated glaſs, in ſpite of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of its tenacity and arched fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure.</p>

               <p>Yet that which I mainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd in this Experiment was, (if I were able) to ſhew and prove at once, by an Inſtance not lyable to the ordinary exceptions, the true Nature of Rarefaction and Condenſation, at leaſt of the Air. For, to ſay nothing of the <hi>Peripatetick</hi> Rarefaction and Condenſation, ſtrictly ſo call'd, which I ſcruple not to declare, I think to be phyſically inconceptible or impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; 'tis plain by our Experiment, that, when the Bubble, after the Glaſs had been firſt thruſt in towards the Center, was expanded again by heat, the included Air <hi>poſſeſs'd</hi> more room than before, and yet it could perfectly <hi>fill</hi> no more room than formerly, each Aerial Particle taking up, both before and after the heating of the Bubble, a portion of ſpace adequate to its own bulk; ſo that in the Cavity of the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:48183:23"/>
expanded Bubble we muſt admit either Vacuities interſpers'd between the Corpuſcles of the Air, or that ſome fine Particles of the Flame, or other ſubtil matter, came in to fill up thoſe Intervals, which matter muſt have enter'd the Cavity of the Glaſs at its pores: And afterwards, when the red-hot Bubble was removed from the flame, it is evident, that, ſince the groſſer particles of the Air could not get through the Glaſs, which they were not able to do, even when vehemently agitated by an ambient Flame, the Compreſſion of the Bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and the Condenſation of the Air, which was neceſſarily conſequent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, could not, ſuppoſing the Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the World, be performed without ſqueezing out ſome of the ſubtil matter contained in the cavity of the Bubble, whence it could not iſſue but at the pores of the Glaſs. But I will no longer detain you from Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his Explications of the <hi>Machina Boyliana;</hi> to the firſt of which you may now, if you pleaſe, advance.</p>

               <p>The deſires to obviate that very difficulty, for their ſatisfaction, that had not yet penetrated the grounds of our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> made me think of employing, inſtead of a Receiver of Glaſs, one of a ſtiff and tough, but yet ſomewhat flexible, Metal. And accordingly having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a new Pewter Porrenger, and whelm'd it upſide down upon an Iron plate faſten'd to (the upper end of) our Pneumatical Pump, we carefully faſten'd by Cement the orifice to the plate, and though the inverted Veſſel, by reaſon of its ſtiffneſs and thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the convexity of its ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficies, were ſtrong enough to have ſupported a great weight without changing its figure; yet, as ſoon as by an exſuction or two the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of the included Air was brought to ſuch a degree of expan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that its weaken'd Spring was able to afford but little aſſiſtance to the tenacity and firmneſs of the Metal,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:48183:26"/>
the weight of the pillar of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent Atmoſphere (which by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the breadth of the Veſſel was conſiderably wide alſo) did preſently and notably depreſs the upper part of the Porringer, both leſſening its capacity and changing its figure; ſo that inſtead of the Convex ſurface, the Receiver had before, it came to a Concave one, which new figure was ſomewhat, though not much, increaſed by the further withdrawing of the included and already rarified Air. The Experiment ſucceeded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with an other common Porringer of the ſame Metal. But in ſuch kind of Veſſels, made purpoſely of Iron plates, it will ſometimes ſucceed and ſometimes not, according to the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the veſſel and the thickneſs of the plate, which was ſometimes ſtrong enough and ſometimes too weak to reſiſt the preſſure of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent Air. And ſometimes I found alſo, that the veſſel would be thruſt in, not at the top but ſide-ways, in caſe <hi>that</hi> ſide were the only part that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:48183:27"/>

               <p>Here are ſeveral things joyn'd together, which the Author had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeparately alledg'd in his often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Dialogue. The <hi>firſt</hi> is, the Cauſe he aſſigns of the aſcenſion of the Sucker forcibly depreſt to the bottom of the exhauſted Cylinder, and then let alone by him that pumpt; to which might be added, that this aſcenſion ſucceeded, when the Sucker was clogg'd with an hundred pound weight. This Explication of Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> you will find examin'd in the 33<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 39<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, and ſome enſuing pages of my Diſcourſe. And as to his deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the weight or preſſure of the Air could drive up the Sucker in that Phaenomenon, becauſe the Air does not weigh in Air, we may ſee the contrary largely proved in divers
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48183:30"/>
places of my <hi>Examen,</hi> and more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly and expreſly in the four firſt pages of the <hi>third</hi> Chapter. And whereas he ſays in the laſt place, that the viſibility of Bodies included in our Receivers, and the propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Sound, (which, by the way, is not to be underſtood of all Sound that may be heard, though made in the exhauſted Receiver,) are alone ſufficient Arguments to prove no <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum:</hi> I have conſider'd that paſſage in the anſwer I made to the like alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation in the 45<hi rend="sup">th</hi> page of the <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> and ſhall only obſerve here, that, ſince the <hi>Vacuiſts</hi> can prove, that much of the Air is pumpt out of the exhauſted Receiver, and will pretend, that, notwithſtanding many interſpers'd Vacuities, there may be in the Receiver corporeal ſubſtance enough to tranſmit Light and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Sounds, Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> has not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd what he pretended, if he have but barely proved, that there may be Subſtances capable of conveying Light and Sound in the cavity of our
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48183:30"/>
Receiver, ſince he triumphantly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts, <hi>Nullum eſſe in Recipienti Vacuum.</hi> But we may leave Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> and his Adverſaries to diſpute out this point, and go on to the next paſſage.</p>

               <p>This Explication is not probable enough, to oblige me to add any thing about it to what I have ſaid in the 49<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and the two following pages of my <hi>Examen;</hi> eſpecially the moſt vehement motion, aſcrib'd to the Air in the Receiver, having been before proved to be an Imaginary thing.

               <p>This Compariſon which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> here ſummarily makes, he more fully diſplay'd in his Dialogue <hi>De Natura Aeris,</hi> and I conſider'd, what he there alledg'd, in the 52<hi rend="sup">th</hi> page and the two next of my <hi>Examen.</hi> And, though I will not contradict Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> in what he hiſtorically aſſerts in this paſſage; yet I cannot but ſomewhat doubt, whether he mingles not his conjecture with the bare matter of fact. For, though I have with ſome curioſity viſited Mines in more places than one, and propos'd Queſtions to Men that have been converſant in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mines, both elſewhere and in <hi>England</hi> (and particularly in <hi>Derbyſhire</hi> where Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> lived long;) yet I could never find, that any ſuch odd and vehement wind, as Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> aſcribes the Phaenomenon to, had
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:48183:32"/>
been by them obſerved to kill the Diggers, and extinguiſh well-lighted Coals themſelves: And indeed, it ſeems more likely, that the damp, by its tenacity or ſome peculiarly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lign quality, did the miſchief, than a wind, of which I found not any notice taken; eſpecially ſince we ſee, what vehement winds Men will be able to endure for a long time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being near-kill'd by them; and that it ſeems very odd, that a wind, that Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> does not obſerve to have blown away the Coals, that were let down, ſhould be able (in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of kindling them more fiercely) to blow them <hi>out.</hi>

               <p>This Phaenomenon he likewiſe took notice of, and attempted to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate in his above-mention'd Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, which gave me occaſion in the 46<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 47<hi rend="sup">th</hi> pages of my <hi>Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> to ſhew how unlikely 'tis, that the vehement motion of the Air ſhould be the cauſe of it; but he here tells us, that 'tis not imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that this dancing of the water (as he is pleas'd to call it) proceeds from a <hi>vacuum,</hi> nor do I know any Man that ever pretended, that a <hi>va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuum</hi> was the efficient cauſe of it. But the <hi>Vacuiſts</hi> perhaps will tell him, that, though the bubbling of the water be not an <hi>effect</hi> of a <hi>vacuum,</hi> it may be a <hi>proof</hi> of it againſt him; for they will tell him, that it has been formerly proved, that a great part of the Atmoſpherical Air is by pumping remov'd out of our exhauſted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and conſequently can no more, as formerly, preſs upon the ſurface of the water. Nor does Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:48183:33"/>
ſhew what ſucceeds in the room of it; and therefore it will be allowable, for them to conclude againſt him (though not perhaps againſt the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſians)</hi> that there are a great many interſpers'd Vacuities left in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, which are the occaſion, though not the proper efficient cauſe, of the Phaenomenon. For they will ſay, that the Springy Particles of the yet included Air, having room to unbend themſelves in the ſpaces deſerted by the Air that was pumpt out, the Aerial and Springy Corpuſcles, that lay conceal'd in the pores of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, being now freed from the wonted preſſure that kept them coil'd up in the liquor, expanded themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to numerous bubbles, which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their comparative lightneſs, are extruded by the water, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them appear to have riſen from the bottom of it. And Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s vehement wind, to produce the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Circumſtances of this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, muſt be a laſting one. For, after the agitation of the Pump has
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48183:34"/>
been quite left off, provided the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Air be kept from getting in, the bubbles will ſometimes continue to riſe for an hour after. And that which agrees very well with our Explication and very ill with that of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s, is, that, when by having continued to pump a competent time, the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has been freed from the Aerial particles that lurk'd in it before, though one continue to pump as lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtily as he did, yet the water will not at all be cover'd with bubbles as it was, the Air that produc'd them being ſpent; though, according to Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s Explication, the wind in the Receiver continuing, the dance of the water ſhould continue too.</p>

               <p>Etiam, &amp; quidem illâ ipsâ vi quam à pondere accipit Argenti vivi.</p>
               <p>I confeſs this Allegation did a little ſurprize me: It concern'd Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> to prove, that as much Air, as was diſplac'd by the deſcending Mercury, did at the orifice of the Tube, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd in ſtagnant Mercury, inviſibly aſcend to the upper part of the pipe. To prove this he tells us, that a blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der full of Air being depreſs'd in Quickſilver, will, when the hand that depreſs'd it is remov'd, be ſqueez'd up by the very weight of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, whence it follows, that Air may penetrate Quickſilver. But I know not, who ever deny'd, that Air inviron'd with Quickſilver may thereby be ſqueez'd upwards; but, ſince even very ſmall bubbles of Air may be ſeen to move in their paſſage through Mercury, I ſee not, how this Example will at all help the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of it. For 'tis by meer acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the Air included in the bladder comes to be buoy'd up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the bladder it ſelf is ſo; and if
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48183:37"/>
it were fill'd with Water inſtead of Air, or with Stone inſtead of Water, it would nevertheleſs emerge, as himſelf confeſſes it would do, if it were made of Iron, or of any Matter beſides Gold, becauſe all other Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are lighter <hi>in ſpecie</hi> than Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver. But ſince the emerſion of the bladder is manifeſt enough to the ſight, I ſee not how it will ſerve Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s turn, who is to prove that the Air gets into the Torricel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Tube inviſibly; ſince 'tis plain, that even heedful obſervation can make our Eyes diſcover no ſuch tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Air; which (to add that inforcement of our Argument) muſt not only paſs unſeen through the ſuſtained Quickſilver, but muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe unperceivedly dive, in ſpite of its comparative lightneſs, beneath the ſurface of the ponderous ſtagnant Mercury, to get in at the orifice of the erected Tube. But let us, if you pleaſe, hear the reſt of his Diſcourſe about this Experiment.</p>

               <p>In anſwer to this Explication I have in my <hi>Examen</hi> propos'd divers things, which you may there meet with: And indeed his Explication has appear'd ſo improbable to thoſe that have written of this Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that I have not found it em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brac'd by any of them, though, when divers of them oppos'd it, the Phaenomena of our Engine were not yet divulg'd. Not then needleſly to repeat what has been ſaid already, I ſhall on this occaſion only add one Experiment, that I afterwards made, and it was this: Having made the Torricellian Experiment (in a ſtraight Tube) after the ordinary way, we took a little piece of a fine Bladder, and raiſing the Pipe a little in the ſtagnant Mercury, but not ſo high
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48183:38"/>
as the ſurface of it, the piece of Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was dexterouſly conveyed in the Quickſilver, ſo as to be applied by ones finger to the immerſed orifice of the Pipe, without letting the Air get into the Cavity of it; then the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was tyed very ſtraight and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to the lower end of the Pipe, whoſe orifice (as we ſaid) it cover'd before, and then the Pipe being ſlow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lifted out of the ſtagnant Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, the impendent Quickſilver ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd to lean but very lightly upon the Bladder, being ſo near an exact Aequilibrium with the Atmoſperical Air, that, if the Tube were but a very little inclin'd, whereby the gravita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Quickſilver, being not ſo perpendicular, came to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what leſſen'd, the Bladder would immediately be driven into the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Tube, and to the Eye, plac'd without, appear to have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd a concave ſuperficies inſtead of the convex it had before. And when the Tube was re-erected, the Bladder would no longer appear
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:48183:39"/>
ſuck'd in, but be again ſomewhat protuberant. And if, when the Mercury in the Pipe was made to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend a little below its ſtation into the ſtagnant Mercury, if, I ſay, at that nick of time the piece of Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der were nimbly and dexterouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, as before, to the immers'd o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice, and faſten'd to the ſides of the Pipe, upon the lifting the Inſtrument out of the ſtagnant Mercury, the Cylinder of that Liquor being now ſomewhat ſhort of its due height, was no longer able fully to counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poiſe the weight of the Atmoſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Air, which conſequently, though the Glaſs were held in an erected po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, would preſs up the Bladder in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the orifice of the Pipe, and both make and maintain there a Cavity ſenſible both to the Touch and the Eye.</p>

               <p>To ſatisfie ſome Ingenious Men, that were more diffident of, than skilful in, Hydroſtaticks, that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:48183:39"/>
the preſſure of the external Air is ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſuſtaining a Cylinder of 29 or 30 Inches of Mercury, and upon a ſmall leſſening of the gravitation of that ponderous liquor, to preſs it up higher into the Tube. But a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſe may be made of it againſt Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s pretenſion. For, when the Tube is again erected, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury will ſubſide as low as at firſt, and leave as great a ſpace as former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was left deſerted at the top; into which how the Air ſhould get to fill it, will not appear eaſie to them, that, like you and me, know by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tryals, that a Bladder will rather be burſt by Air than grant it paſſage. And if it ſhould be pretended, <hi>either</hi> that ſome Air from without had yet got through the Bladder, <hi>or</hi> that the Air, that they may preſume to have been juſt before included between the Bladder and the Mercury, made its way from the lower part of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument to the upper; 'tis obvious to anſwer, That 'tis no way likely, that it ſhould paſs all along the Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linder
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48183:40"/>
unſeen by us; ſince, when there are really any Aerial Bubbles, though ſmaller than Pins heads, they are eaſily diſcernible. And in our caſe, there is no ſuch reſiſtance of the Air to the aſcenſion of the ſtagnant Mercury, as Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> pretends in the Torricellian Experiment made the uſual way.</p>

               <p>I think he may juſtly ſay ſo; but 'tis like they will reply, that, in their way of explicating the Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricellian Experiment, they do not <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> a <hi>Vacuum</hi> at to Air, but <hi>prove</hi> it. For they ſhew a great ſpace, that having been juſt before fill'd with Quickſilver, is now deſerted by it, though it appeared not, that any Air ſucceeded in its room; but rather, that the upper end of the Tube is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther totally or near totally ſo devoid of Air, that the Quickſilver may without reſiſtance, by barely incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Tube, be made to fill it to the very top: Whereas Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> is fain to have recourſe to that which he knows they deny, the Plenitude of the World, not proving by any ſenſible Phaenomena, that there <hi>did</hi> get in through the Quickſilver Air enough to fill the deſerted part of the Tube, but only concluding, that ſo much Air <hi>muſt</hi> have got in there, becauſe, the World being full, it could find no room any where elſe; which the <hi>Vacuiſts</hi> will take for no
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:48183:41"/>
proof at all, and the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> though <hi>Pleniſts,</hi> who admit an Etherial mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter capable of paſſing through the pores of Glaſs, will, I doubt, look upon but as an improper Explication.</p>

               <p>I remember on this occaſion another Experiment of yours, that ſeems unfavourable enough to Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s Explication, and you will perhaps call it to mind when I tell you, that 'twas made in a bended Pipe almoſt fill'd with Quickſilver.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>To ſee whether we underſtand one another, I will briefly deſcribe the Inſtrument I think you mean. We took a Cylindrical Pipe of Glaſs, clos'd at the upper end, and of that length, that being dexterouſly bent at ſome Inches from the bottom, the ſhorter legg was made as parallel as we could to the longer: In this Glaſs we found an expedient, (for 'tis not eaſie to do,) to make the Torricellian Experiment, the Quickſilver in the ſhorter legg ſerving inſtead of the ſtagnant Quickſilver in the uſual Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſcope, and the Quickſilver in the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48183:41"/>
longer legg reaching above that in the ſhorter about eight or nine and twenty Inches. Then, by another artifice, the ſhorter legg, into which the Mercury did not riſe within an Inch of the top, was ſo order'd, that it could in a trice be Hermetically ſeal'd, without diſordering the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver. And this is the Inſtrument that I gheſs you mean.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>It is ſo, and I remember, that it is the ſame with that, which in the Paradox about Suction you call, whilſt the ſhorter legg remains un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeal'd, a <hi>Travelling Baroſcope.</hi> But when I ſaw you make the Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that legg was Hermetically ſeal'd, an Inch of Air in its natural or uſual conſiſtence being left in the upper part of it, to which Air you outwardly applied a pair of heated Tongs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Yet that, which I chiefly aim'd at in the Trial, was not the Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon I perceive you mean; for, my deſign was, by breaking the Ice for them, to encourage ſome, that may
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:48183:42"/>
have more skill and accommodation than I then had, to make an attempt that I did not find to have been made by any; namely, to reduce the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive force of Heat in every way included Air, if not in ſome other Bodies alſo, to ſome kind of meaſure, and, if 'twere poſſible, to determin it by weight. And I preſumed, that at leaſt the event of my Tryal would much confirm ſeveral Explications of mine, by ſhewing, that Heat is able, as long as it laſts, very conſiderably to increaſe the Spring or preſſing power of the Air. And in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture I was not miſtaken; for, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſhut up, after the manner new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recited, a determinate quantity of uncompreſt Air, which, (in the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment you ſaw,) was about one Inch; we warily held a pair of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Tongs near the outſide of the Glaſs, (without making it touch the Inſtrument, for fear of breaking it,) whereby the Air being agitated was enabled to expand it ſelf to double its former Dimenſions, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48183:42"/>
had its Spring ſo ſtrengthen'd by Heat, that it was able to raiſe all the Quickſilver in the longer legg, and keep up or ſuſtain a Mercurial Cylinder of about nine and twenty Inches high, when by its expanſion it would, if it had not been for the Heat, have loſt half the force of its elaſticity. But whatever I deſign in this Experiment, pray tell me, what uſe you would make of it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. <hi>Hobbes.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I believe, he will find it very difficult to ſhew, what keeps the Mercury ſuſpended in the longer legg of the <hi>Travelling Baroſcope,</hi> when the ſhorter legg is unſtopt, at which it may run out; ſince this Inſtrument may, as I have try'd, be carried to diſtant places, where it cannot with probability be pretended, that any Air has been diſplac'd by the fall of the Quickſilver in the longer legg, which perhaps fell long before above a mile off. And when the ſhorter legg is feal'd, it will be very hard for Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> to ſhew there the odd
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48183:43"/>
motions of the Air, to which he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes the Torricellian Experiment. For, if you warily incline the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Quickſilver will riſe to the top of the longer legg, and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſubſide, when the Inſtrument is again erected, and yet no Air ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to paſs through the Quickſilver interpos'd between the ends of the longer and the ſhorter legg. But that which I would chiefly take notice of in the Experiment, is, that upon the external application of a hot Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the ſhorter legg of the Baroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cope, when 'twas ſeal'd up, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded Air was expanded from one Inch to two, and ſo rais'd the whole Cylinder of Mercury in the longer legg, and, whilſt the heat continued undiminiſhed, kept it from ſubſiding again. For, if the Air were able to get unſeen through the body of the Quickſilver, why had it not been much more able, when rarified by Heat, to paſs through the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, than for want of doing ſo to raiſe and ſuſtain ſo weighty a Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:48183:43"/>
of Mercury? I ſhall not ſtay to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire on this occaſion, how Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> will, according to his <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate the rarefaction of the Air to double its former dimenſions, and the condenſation of it again; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince, aſſerting that part of the upper legg, that is unfill'd with the Quickſilver, to be perfectly full of Air, he affirms that, which I doubt he cannot prove, and which may very probably be diſproved by the Experiment you mention in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe about <hi>Suction,</hi> where you ſhew, to another purpoſe, that in a <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling Baroſcope,</hi> whoſe ſhorter legg is ſeal'd, if the end of the longer legg be open'd, whereby it comes <hi>indeed</hi> to be fill'd with Air, the preſſure of that Air will enable the ſubjacent Mercury notably to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the Air included in the ſhorter legg.</p>

               <p>As to the firſt Clauſe of Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s account of our Phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menon, the <hi>Vacuiſts</hi> will eaſily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer his Queſtion by acknowledging, that there were indeed interſpers'd Vacuities in the Air contain'd in the Vial before the ſuction; but they will add, there was no reaſon, why the Water ſhould aſcend to fill them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, being a heavy body, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not riſe of it ſelf, but muſt be raiſed by ſome prevalent weight or preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which then was wanting. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, that there being interſpers'd Vacuities as well in the reſt of the Air that was very near the Water, as in that contained in the Vial, there was no reaſon, why the Water
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:48183:45"/>
ſhould aſcend to fill the Vacuities of one portion of Air rather than thoſe of another. But when once by ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction a great many of the Aerial Corpuſcles were made to paſs out of the Vial, the Spring of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Air being weaken'd, whilſt the preſſure of the ambient Air, which depends upon its conſtant Gravity, is undiminiſhed, the Spring of the internal becomes unable to reſiſt the weight of the external Air, which is therefore able to impel the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd Water with ſome violence into the Cavity of the Glaſs, 'till the Air, remaining in that Cavity, being reduced almoſt to its uſual Denſity, is able by its Spring, and the weight of the Water got up into the Vial, to hinder any more Water from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impell'd up. For, as to what Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> affirms, that, <hi>Is qui ſu git Phialam neque in ventrem quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam, neque in pulmones, neque in os quicquam exugit:</hi> How it will agree with what he elſewhere delivers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Suction. I leave him to conſider.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48183:45"/>
But I confeſs, I cannot but wonder at his confidence, that can poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſert a thing ſo repugnant to the common ſentiments of Men of all opinions, without offering any proof for it. But I ſuppoſe, they that are by tryal acquainted with Sucking, and have felt the Air come in at their mouths, will prefer their own expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience to his authority. And as to what he adds, that the Perſon that ſucks agitates the Air, and turns it within the Vial into a kind of circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating wind, that endeavours every where to get out; I wiſh, he had ſhewn us by what means a Man that ſucks makes this odd Commotion of the Air; eſpecially in ſuch Vials as I uſe to employ about the Experiment, the orifice of whoſe neck is ſometimes leſs than a Pins head.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>That there may be really Air extracted by Suction out of a Glaſs, me thinks you might argue from an Experiment I ſaw you make with a Receiver which was exhauſted by your Pump, and conſequently by Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48183:46"/>
For I remember, when you had counterpois'd it with very good Scales, and afterwards by turning a ſtop-cock, let in the outward Air, there ruſh'd in as much Air to fill the ſpace that had been deſerted by the Air pumpt out, as weighed ſome ſcruples (conſiſting of twenty grains a piece) though the Receiver were not of the largeſt ſize.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>You did well to add that Clauſe; for, the <hi>Magdobargic</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, mentioned by the induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Schottus,</hi> having been made with a vaſt Receiver, the readmitted Air amounted to a whole ounce and ſome drachms. But to return to Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> I fear not that he will perſwade you, that have ſeen the Experiment he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites, that as ſoon as the neck of the Vial is unſtopt under water, the Air, that whitl'd about before, makes a ſally out, and forces in as much wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For, if the orifice be any thing large, you will, inſtead of feeling an endeavour to thruſt away your finger that ſtopt it, find the pulp of
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48183:46"/>
your finger ſo thruſt inward, that a <hi>Peripatetick</hi> would affirm that he felt it ſuckt in. And that Intruſion may be the Reaſon, why the lip of him that ſucks is oftentimes ſtrongly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten'd to the orifice of the Vials neck, which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> aſcribes to a moſt exquiſit contact, but without clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly telling us, how that extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry contact is effected. And when your finger is removed, inſtead of perceiving any Air go out of the Vial through the water, (which, if any ſuch thing happen, you will eaſily diſcover by the bubbles,) you ſhall ſee the water briskly ſpring up in a ſlender ſtream to the top of the Vial, which it could not do, if the Cavity were already full of Air. And to let you ſee, that, when the Air does really paſs in or out of the Vial im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers'd under water, 'tis very eaſie to perceive its motions, if you dip the neck of the Vial in water, and then apply to the globulous part of it either your warm hands or any other competent Heat, the internal
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48183:47"/>
Air being rarified; you ſhall ſee a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, anſwerable to the degree of Heat you applied, manifeſtly paſs through the water in ſucceſſive bub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, whilſt yet you ſhall not ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny water get into the Vial to ſupply the place deſerted by that Air. And if, when you have (as you may do by the help of ſucking) fill'd the neck and part of the belly of the Vial with water, you immerſe the orifice into ſtagnant water, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply warm hands to the globulous part as before, you will find the water in the Vial to be driven out, before any bubbles paſs out of the Vial into the ſurrounding water; which ſhews, that the Air is not ſo forward to dive under the water, (and much leſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſo ponderous a liquor as Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver,) as Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> has ſuppoſed.</p>

               <p>That 'tis the Preſſure of the external Air, that (ſurmounting the Spring of the internal) drives up the water into the Vial we have been ſpeaking of, does, I confeſs, follow upon your Hypotheſis: But an Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentarian

               <p>You bring into my mind what I once deviſed to confirm my Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis about Suction, but found a while ſince that I had omitted it in my Diſcourſe about that Subject. And therefore I ſhall now repeat to you the ſubſtance at leaſt of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial that was written of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment, by which the great inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the weight of the Atmoſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical Air in Suction will appear, and in which alſo ſome things will oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, that will not well agree with Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s Explication, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſome of his Allegations againſt mine.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Having not yet met with an Experiment of this nature, ſuch an one as you ſpeak of will be welcome to me.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>We took a Glaſs Bubble, whoſe long ſtem was both very ſlender and very Cylindrical; then by applying
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48183:48"/>
to the outſide of the Ball or globu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous part a convenient heat, we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd ſo much of the Air, as that, when the end of the pipe was dipt in water, and the inward Air had time to recover its former coolneſs, the water aſcended either to the top of the pipe or very near it. This done, we gently and warily rarified the Air in the Cavity of the Bubble, 'till by its expanſion it had driven out almoſt all the water that had got up into the ſtem, that ſo it might attain as near as could be to that degree of heat and meaſure of expanſion, that it had when the water began to riſe in it. And we were careful to leave two or three drops of water unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd at the bottom of the pipe, that we might be ſure, that none of the included Air was by this ſecond ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refaction driven out at the orifice of it; as the depreſſion of the water ſo low aſſured us, on the other ſide, that the included Air wanted nothing conſiderable of the expanſion it had when the water began to aſcend into
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:48183:48"/>
the pipe. Whilſt the Air was in this rarified ſtate, we preſently removed the little Inſtrument out of the ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant water into ſtagnant Quickſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, which in a ſhort time began to riſe in the pipe. Now, if the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the liquor were the effect of Natures Abhorrence of a <hi>Vacuum;</hi> or of ſome internal principle of Motion; or of the Compreſſion and propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Pulſion of the outward Air by that which had been expell'd; why ſhould not the Mercury have aſcended to the top of the pipe, as the water did before? But <hi>de facto</hi> it did not aſcend half, or perhaps a quarter ſo far; and if the pipe had been long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, as well as 'twas ſlender e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, I queſtion, whether the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury would have aſcended (in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the length of the ſtem) half ſo high as it did.</p>
               <p>Now of this Experiment, which we tryed more than once, I ſee not, for the reaſon lately expreſs'd, how any good account will be given with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out our <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> but according to <hi>That</hi> 'tis clear.</p>

               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>I think I perceive why you ſay ſo; for the Aſcenſion of Liquors being an effect of the prevalency of the external Airs preſſure againſt the reſiſtance it meets with in the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the Inſtrument, and the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver being bulk for bulk many times heavier than water, the ſame ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pluſage of preſſure that was able to impel up water to the top of the pipe, ought not to be able to impel up the Quickſilver to any thing near that height. And if it be here ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, as it very plauſibly may be, that the raiſed Cylinder of Mercury was much longer than it ought to have been in reference to a Cylinder of Water, the proportion in gravity between thoſe two Liquors (which is almoſt that of fourteen to one) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſidered; I anſwer, that when the Cylinder of Water reach'd to the pipe, the Air poſſeſs'd no more than the Cavity of the globulous part of the Inſtrument, being very little aſſiſted to dilate it ſelf by ſo light a Cylin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as that of Water: But when
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:48183:49"/>
the Quickſilver came to be impell'd into the Inſtrument by the weight of the external Air, that ponderous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy did not ſtop its aſcent as ſoon as it came to be equiponderant to the formerly expell'd Cylinder of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; becauſe, to attain that height, it reached but a little way into the pipe, and left all the reſt of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the pipe to be fill'd with part of that Air, which formerly was all ſhut up in the Cavity of the Bubble; by which means the Air, included in the whole Inſtrument, muſt needs be in a ſtate of expanſion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by have its Spring weakened, and conſequently diſabled to reſiſt the preſſure of the external Air, as much as the ſame included Air did before, when it was leſs rarified; on which account, the undiminiſhed weight or preſſure of the external Air was able to raiſe the Quickſilver higher and higher, 'till it had obtained that height, at which the preſſure, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of the weight of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial Cylinder and the Spring of the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:48183:50"/>
internal Air (now leſs rarified than before,) was equivalent to the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Atmoſphere or external Air.</p>

               <p>You have given the very Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication I was about to propoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherefore I ſhall only add, that, to confirm this Experiment by a kind of Inverſion of it, we drove by heat a little Air out of the Bubble, and dipt the open end of the pipe into Quickſilver, which by this means we made to aſcend 'till it had fill'd about a fourth part or leſs of the pipe, when that was held erected. Then carefully removing it without letting fall any Quickſilver, or let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in any Air, we held the orifice of the pipe a little under the ſurface of a Glaſs full of Water, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying a moderate heat to the outſide of the Ball, we warily expell'd the Quickſilver, yet leaving a little of it to make it ſure that no Air was driven out with it; then ſuffering the included Air to cool, the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Air was found able to make the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48183:50"/>
Water not only aſcend to the very top of the pipe, and thence ſpread it ſelf a little into the Cavity of the Ball, but to carry up before it the Quickſilver that had remained unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd at the bottom of the ſtem. And if in making the Experiment we had firſt raiſed, as we ſometimes did, a greater quantity of Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilver, and afterwards drove it out, the quantity of Water, that would be impell'd into the Cavity of the pipe and ball, would be accordingly increaſed.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>In this Experiment 'tis mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that ſomething is driven out of the Cavity of the Glaſs before the Water or Quickſilver begins to aſcend in it: And here alſo we ſee not, that the Air can paſs through the pores of Quickſilver or Water, but that it drives them on before it, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſenſibly mixing with them. In this Experiment there appears not at all any Circular Wind, as Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> fancies in the ſuckt Vial we are diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of, nor any tendency outwards
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48183:51"/>
of the included Air upon the account of ſuch a Wind; but, inſtead of theſe things, that the aſcenſion of the Liquors into the Cavity of the pipe depends upon the external Air, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing up the Liquors into that Cavity, may be argu'd by this, that the ſame weight of the Atmoſphere im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd up into the pipe ſo much more of the lighter Liquor, <hi>Water,</hi> than of the heavier Liquor, <hi>Mercury.</hi>

               <p>You have ſaid enough on this Experiment; but 'tis not the only I have to oppoſe to Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication: For, that there is no need of the ſallying of Air out of a Vial, to make the Atmoſpherical Air preſs againſt a Body that cloſes the orifice of it, when the preſſure of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Air is much weakened; I have had occaſion to ſhew ſome <hi>Virtuoſi,</hi> by ſucking out, with the help of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, a conſiderable portion of the Air contained in a Glaſs; for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving then, inſtead of unſtopping the orifice under water, nimbly applied a flat Body to it, the external Air preſs'd
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48183:51"/>
that Body ſo forcibly againſt it, as to keep it faſtened and ſuſpended, though 'twere clogg'd with a weight of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ounces.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>A.</speaker>
               <p>Another Experiment of yours Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi>'s Explication brings into my mind, by which it appears, that, if there be ſuch a Circular Wind, as he pretends, produced by Suction in the Cavity of the Vial, it muſt needs be ſtrangely laſting. For I have ſeen more than once, that, when you have by an Inſtrument ſuckt much of the Air out of a Vial, and afterwards carefully cloſed it, though you kept the ſlender neck of it ſtopt a long time, perhaps for ſome weeks or months, yet when 'twas open'd under water, a conſiderable quantity of the Liquor would be briskly impell'd up into the neck and belly of the Vial. So that, though I will not be ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> as to mind you on this occaſion of thoſe Writers of Natural Magick, that teach us to ſhut up Articulate, Sounds in a Veſſel, which being tranſported to a diſtant
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:48183:52"/>
place and open'd there, will render the Words that are committed to it; yet I muſt needs ſay, that ſo laſting a Circular Wind, as, according to Mr. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> your Experiments exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, may well deſerve our wonder.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>B.</speaker>
               <p>Your admiration would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance increaſe, if I ſhould aſſure you, that having with the Sun-beams produced ſmoak in one of thoſe well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtopt Vials, this Circular Wind did not at all appear to blow it about, but ſuffered it to riſe, as it would have done if the included Air had been ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry calm. And now I ſhall add but one Experiment more, which will not be liable to ſome of the things as inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid as they are, which Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> has alledged in his account of the Vial, and which will let you ſee, that the weight of the Atmoſpherical Air is a very conſiderable thing; and which may alſo incline you to think, that, whilſt Mr. <hi>Hobbes</hi> does not admit a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiler Matter than common Air to paſs through the Pores of cloſe and ſolid Bodies, the Air he has recourſe to will
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48183:52"/>
ſometimes come too late to prevent a <hi>Vacuum.</hi> The Experiment, which was partly accidental, I lately found regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to this ſenſe, if not in theſe words: [Having, to make ſome Diſcovery of the weight of the Air, and for other purpoſes, caus'd an Aeolipile, very light conſidering its bulk, to be made by a famous Artiſt, I had occaſion to put it ſo often into the fire for ſeveral Tryals, that at length the Copper ſcal'd off by degrees, and left the Veſſel much thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than when it firſt came out of the Artificers hands; and a good while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this change in the Inſtrument be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not in my thoughts, I had occaſion to imploy it, as formerly, to weigh how many grains it would contain of the Air at ſuch a determinate conſtitution of the Atmoſphere, as was to be met with, where I then chanced to be. For the making this Experiment the more exactly, the Air was by a ſtrong, but warily applied, fire ſo carefully driven away, that, when clapping a piece of Sealing-wax to the Pin-hole, at which it had been forced out, we hindred any
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48183:53"/>
communication betwixt the Cavity of the Inſtrument and the external Air, we ſuppos'd the Aeolipile to be very well exhauſted, and therefore laid it by, that, when it ſhould be grown cold, we might, by opening the orifice with a Pin, again let in the outward Air, and obſerve the encreaſe of weight that would thereupon enſue: But the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument, that, as I was ſaying, was grown thin, had been ſo diligently freed from Air, that the very little that remain'd, and was kept by the Wax from receiving any aſſiſtance from without, being unable by its Spring to aſſiſt the Aeolipile to ſupport the weight of the ambient Air; this exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fluid did by its weight preſs againſt it ſo ſtrongly, that it compreſs'd it, and thruſt it ſo conſiderably inwards, and in more than one place ſo chang'd its figure, that, when I ſhew'd it to the <hi>Virtuoſi</hi> that were aſſembled at <hi>Greſham-Colledge,</hi> they were pleaſed to command it of me to be kept in their Repoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, where I preſume it is ſtill to be ſeen.</p>
