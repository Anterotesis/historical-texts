            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in this ſubordinate government ſo jealous and irkeſome to the people, it is neceſſary to be on ſure termes for the future, and that Catholickes have a hand in the government, to prevent the like miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes.

He then that will hinder or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this, to looſe the King ſuch a conſiderable party and aſſiſtance, can be no other then an enemy, ayming at nothing elſe, but to weaken his Majeſty, by diverting this Nation, as it were by compulſion from<note place="margin">Add.</note> his ſervice. And this is not to force the King, and worke his neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but to helpe him, and relieve them, and to buy our Peace with the marrow of our purſes and bloud of our veines, which his Majeſty may (indeede) well remember hereafter, not to recall our liberties, but to record our loyalties. Moreover, his Majeſty may aſwell in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſay, that he is forced to the conditions of peace profered, as to thoſe demanded: for neyther the one, nor the other, would ever have beene granted in precedent times, though not by want of gracious inclination in his Majeſties to favour us, but by the ſiniſter characters which his miniſters here, ever gave him of us.</p>

                  <hi>Quaere</hi> 3. Will you looſe the King all his proteſtant party, which will fall from him, and will you looſe him all his proteſtant Subjects of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and conſequently his Crowne of both king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, which muſt follow, if he give you content?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> Can you imagine that any Subjects, which be true ſubjects, will forſake their Prince, becauſe we tender ayde of men and monyes, and propound motives to advance his ſervice; nay rather the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant party will adviſe his Majeſty conſidering the condition and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity he ſtands in, to give content to this Nation, thereby to gaine ſo conſiderable a party, and aſſiſtance to ſupport his Crowne, and themſelves. Nor can they once ſuſpect with reaſon (if they will not put it on him of purpoſe, as a ſeeming occaſion of their defection from him) that his Majeſty is not conſtant to the proteſtant Religion ſeeing they well know he is by education, and in his beliefe and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:103654:3"/>
as firme a proteſtant as ever <hi>England</hi> bred, as is moſt manifeſt, by all his declarations and proceedings, though it ſtands not with the pollicy of the Parliamentaries, to make this an article of their beliefe; for they hold it a deepe myſterie of ſtate, to misbelieve the King, and not ſuffer him to be believed in this particular, thereby to traduce his Majeſty, and cauſe the Subjects ſtill conceive, he is incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to Papiſtry, whereof they take their greateſt advantage, purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſeduce and incenſe the people againſt him. Now if you feare the proteſtant party will ſo lightly fall from his Majeſty, (as you would faigne perſwade us, to leſſen our conditions) you may aſwell pretend any expreſſion of favour which ſhall be granted us, were it but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivence or tolleration of our Religion, to be a cauſe ſufficient, for the like defection, but if the ſaid proteſtant ſubjects be of reſolution, to continue true and conſtant to his Majeſty, what can more powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly encourage them thereto, or hold them more ſtedfaſtly to ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and juſt a reſolve, then an ample ſupply of men and moneys offered by us, on a good peace, to backe and ſecond their party, the weakeneſſe whereof is not perhaps the leaſt cauſe of all their feares,<note place="margin">Add.</note> and wavering betweene the King and Parliament? But ſuppoſe the King were Catholickely affected, and would abſolutely reſtore us our Religion, and the publicke uſe thereof, in as full and ample manner, as ever we enjoyed it in the times of his Majeſties predeceſſors from the Conqueſt to <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>VIII,</hi> would therefore (or rather ſhould) all his proteſtant ſubjects fall from him, and muſt he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore forfeyte his Crowne? Your <hi>Quaere</hi> anſwers they would, and he muſt, it followes then, they are onely conditionally Subjects, not ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, and his Majeſty holds his Crowne by a conditionall Tenure, not by an abſolute: both which are abſurd. Why did not all the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke Subjects of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland</hi> relinquiſh <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>VIII.</hi> when he forſooke his owne and their Religion? why did not he looſe his Crowne, when he loſt his faith? Why might not the Romiſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of <hi>France,</hi> fall off from the late <hi>French</hi> King, and his Father, when they gave tolleration of Religion, and liberty to build Churches and Synagogues to the <hi>Huguenotes?</hi> Why loſt not they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore their Crownes? But to come neerer home: did not our dread Soveraigne King <hi>Charles</hi> condeſcend unto ſuch propoſitions of the <hi>Scots,</hi> as ſtood not with their loyalty to demand, nor in his power to grant, (to omit all other, witneſſe the abrogation of Epiſcopacie, or unmitering of Biſhops, who be the firſt of the three ſtates of every Chriſtian and Catholicke kingdome) as appeares by ſeverall his Majeſties declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions yet extant. This his Majeſty did, onely to content that Nation, and ſave that Crowne; albeit the former followed not; heavens grant, the later may? for they muſt have <hi>aliquid amplius,</hi> to wit; Kings un-Crowned and Monarchy pull'd downe, how ever his Majeſties prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:103654:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
party in <hi>England, Ireland,</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> fell not therefore from him, neyther is he therefore diſcrowned: and yet muſt both follow, if he give content to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> (in your opinions) or his Royall aſſent to their propoſitions; albeit they containe nothing, but what may mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtly ſuite with their fidelity to propound, and juſtly with his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, power, and expediently with his gracious benignity to grant, &amp; that which hath beene their owne for ten or twelve ages conſequent, and what they enjoyed in quiet poſſeſſion, ever ſince the Conqueſt, during the happy Raigne of fifteene or ſixteene Kings his Majeſties predeceſſors, before <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>VIII.</hi> and ſince then, violently wreſted from them by tyrannie, oppreſſion, and ſurreptitious Lawes, fraudu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently introduced by the bloud-ſucking miniſters of this ſubordinate governement. Moreover, what concernes it the proteſtant Subjects of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> whether we have content or not? How are they any way impeached or improved thereby? or how therein intereſſed? What looſe they by our liberty, or gaine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they by our reſtraint? Can not they goe to Church, though wee goe to Maſſe? the broad Sea is betwixt us, we will be no eye-ſore to them. If it be for their brethren here, we ſeeke not the abrogation of their Religion, or abreviation of their lawfull freedome, or ought elſe derogating to their honour, ſecuritie, or peaceable cohabitation, as appeares by our propoſitions now in Print to the eye of the world, As for his Majeſties proteſtant party proteſtant party here in <hi>Ireland</hi> (not to undervalue them) they are no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable: For, over all <hi>Munster, Vlſter,</hi> and <hi>Connaght,</hi> ſuch as for a while did ſeemingly proclayme themſelves for the King, doe now abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſclayme in him, and declare themſelves for the Parliament, and conſequently, his enemies, ſo as his Majeſty hath no proteſtant party here, but onely in <hi>Leynster,</hi> and that but in a deſtroyed nooke there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, to wit in the Counties of <hi>Dublin,</hi> and <hi>Louth,</hi> and a part of <hi>Kildare</hi> and <hi>Meath,</hi> (for <hi>Doncanon</hi> is fallen off) in all which they cannot make up one thouſand five hundred proteſtants fighting men, where among theſe ſhall hardly cull out two hundred, I might well ſay two ſcore heads well ſquared to the Kings rule, the reſt (as alſo all the proteſtant inhabitants of <hi>Dublin</hi> and their other Townes, farre much more then the moſt part) have their heads ſo Round, as they cannot hold rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to the Parliament, when the leaſt occaſion is offered, As for their hearts, they are from the beginning in the boſome of their pure bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in <hi>VVestminster-hall;</hi> and their heeles are all as nimble and ready to dance a ſcottiſh-jigge, and a parliamentall <hi>revolta,</hi> to <hi>Eſſex</hi> horne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe, if execution were as eaſie, as thought is free, and wiſhes facil; all which is manifeſt by their Common-prayers, publicke diſcourſes, and Commerce, and ſlocking to the Parliament Ships, whenſoever they hover over our coaſtes, and thus are they all affected and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted from head to foote, ſave a very few of the prime, whereof ſome
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:103654:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>

It is eaſie to fall from a proteſtant to a puritant, and from the King to the Parliament. It is their ordinary practiſe, to come and goe daily, a victory or two does it: but the Catholickes cannot with ſuch facility fall from their Religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the differences are eſſentiall, and points of faith; nor from their obedience to his Majeſty, becauſe it is apparent, there is no ſuch affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in them to the puritans, but rather an innated antipathy: So as to ſuch extremes there's no feare of fall. Now if you deeme us ſo weake for the <hi>Scots</hi> and parliamentaries in this kingdome, certainely you are much more, But ſay you? you may joyne with the <hi>Scots,</hi> yes, to forſake the King, you may, and ſo doe your beſt to ſecure this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome for the Parliament and <hi>Scots.</hi> And had not the Catholicke Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my beene now in the Field, and in the way, it is very probable, you had not eſcaped ſo ſcot-free, as you have done.

I ſee no reaſon, but you may feare your portion. You ſay you may ſafely joyne with the <hi>Scots,</hi> to hold out the longer with them, becauſe you conceive them the ſtronger, and us the weaker, why ſhould not you aſwell apprehend, that we may joyne with ſome other forainer, or ſubmit to ſuch, whoſe ſeverall Agents now in the kingdome, perhaps wayte an opportunity in that kinde, and have their eares open ready to ſnatch up ſuch a motion?

Your words and Proclamations ſo often viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both before and ſince the warres, and your wonted faithleſſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, confirmes them in this beliefe. The violence of the ſtorme is over-blowen, they hope, and I am confident, they are reſolved to beare out with their fellow-vaſſals, rather then ſtrike themſelves aground, under your Lee. But ſuppoſe your proclamations brought in a conſiderable party (as I cannot beleeve they will) you will make but a perpetuall Warre, in regard the reſt of the kingdome is ſo poſſeſſed, and ſwayed by the Catholicke Biſhops and Clergy, that in caſe no reaſonable accommodation be made, or content herein be given, the kingdome will be ſo imbroyled and rent, that his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty will not be able to draw any aſſiſtance thereout, to ſupport his Crowne: hee will looſe all his owne revenue, and our ayde of men and monyes, which are (under favour) far tranſcending any his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty may expect from his proteſtant party here, (if any ſuch he hath) and more to be regarded, then the bare walles and empty carcaſſes of Churches, whereto, for the moſt part, no proteſtants, ſave onely the Miniſters with their wives, did ever reſort, in regard the flocke were all of the Catholicke fold, and all the labours, endevours, and perſecutions, being fruſtrat which ſince the ſuppreſſion, were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to propagate the proteſtant Religion in this kingdome, or faſten it on the body thereof, though the Court of wardes hath wrought on a few degenerate members, and devided them from God and their Countrey, I will not ſay, from their King, but I pray, it may not ſo prove. But let it now be conſidered, whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant or Catholicke party here is moſt powerfull, and can bring the King moſt men and money? and if it be not as neceſſary (or more) to give the Catholickes content, as the proteſtants? His Majeſty (we are confident) is graciouſly inclined towards us, as appeares by his ſeverall favourable declarations made in our behalfes, before ſome perſons of worth and credit, now in this kingdome, ready to teſtifie ſo much. To conclude, can thoſe of the Pale, or any other (to whom griping miſery, or raging jelouſie of being vilipended by certayne unnaturall and ungratefull patriots may ſuggeſt a thought of devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding or withdrawing themſelves from our party) be of ſo ſlaviſh an humour, as to joyne with you, when they ſhall reflect, and call to minde, how their immediat predeceſſors, and ſome of themſelves perhaps yet living (by whoſe power and proweſſe in the late prece<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dent warre you kept your footing in the kingdome) were by you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, diſregarded, and abuſed.

Theſe &amp; the like were the ordinary Cabbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net diſcourſes of the ſtate in generall, whereinto ſometimes in publick their malice would burſt forth, and where plantations might not reach, defective Titles ſhould extend. Many Officers and Gentlemen, who had done very good ſervice in the ſaid Warre, and loſt their bloud and limbs therein, for which they had Annuall penſions conferred on them were ſoone after deprived of their ſaid penſions, for onely having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to take the Oath of Supremacie, or Allegeance, in ſuch forme as proteſtants uſe, ſome whereof I have ſeene without hands, which they left at <hi>Kinſale,</hi> in defence of the Crowne of <hi>England,</hi> for which they remayned alſo without thankes, without penſion, for only being faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full to God and their owne ſoules.

I knew my ſelfe a certaine Gentleman, who being queſtioned before the ſtate, for matter of Recuſancy, (as you terme it) anſwered, it was not demanded of me the day of <hi>Kinſale</hi> what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion I was of, it is true, replyed an ungratefull ſtateſ-man, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe you did good ſervice that day, but you doe now, as the Cow, that gives much milke, and ſpils it after with a kicke of her heele, and this kicke (forſooth) was no other then kicking in ſpirit at their foreſaid execrable Oathes, and being a Roman Catholicke.

What then will it be able to affoord when a happy peace ſhall begin to recover it, and bring a full tyde of all flouriſhing plenty, ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when the <hi>Engliſh-pale</hi> ſhall be reinhabited, which now lyes waſt in a manner and uſeleſſe, and hath beene the beſt and richeſt Colony of the land, and the chiefeſt and moſt abounding Granary thereof, and prime ſupport of the ſtate? and if the wayes wee have fixed on, the laſt Aſſembly at <hi>Kilkenny</hi> in <hi>Iuly</hi> 1644. be condeſcended unto, and effectually followed, during this grand neceſſity, they will (I ſay) bring into the treaſury, at leaſt foure hundred thouſand pounds by the yeare, as by the enſuing heads of a revenue agreed unto at <hi>Kilkenny</hi> as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, may plainely appeare. Firſt, the exciſes layd in a moderate way over all our quarters, ſuppoſe halfe aſmuch, as it is in <hi>Dublin,</hi> will amount to a huge ſumme throughout all our Cities and Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as yet not touched in this kind. Secondly, the fourth part of the yearely rent and value of every mans eſtate, which likewiſe I leave to be conſidered. Thirdly, the Kings Rents, Compoſitions, and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes, which (though now in a manner during the warres, loſt, or of ſmall value) will upon a peace ſoone improue, if there ſhall be no <hi>VVentworths</hi> or <hi>Ratclifes,</hi> to cozen the King, or Catch poll the Subject. Fourthly, two partes, or more, of all Church-livings belonging to the Clergy, ſo much now inſiſted upon betweene the Catholicke and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Clergy: and this to aſſiſt his Majeſty during the warres, All which particulars of a revenue, muſt doubtleſſe amount unto a vaſt ſumme, to be imployed firſt, to ſecure and cleere this kingdome of all Round-heads, and other malignant or ill-affected perſons, bee they <hi>Engliſh, Iriſh,</hi> or <hi>Scots,</hi> which by a perfect union of the Proteſtant par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (I meane ſuch as ſincerely adhere to the King) &amp; ours, may be ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily effectuated, through the happy and diſintereſſed governement, we then hope to enjoy, and the free and cheerefull contribution of all<note place="margin">Add.</note> to advance the ſaid ſervice, which being atchieved, then may all our Armies be tranſported into <hi>England,</hi> and our forces be imployed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Majeſties ſuccour which is the longing deſire, and chiefeſt ambition of this loyall Nation, how ſuſpitious ſoever you may be of them, for your owne ſiniſter intentions; all which really pondered, ſans all jealous prejudication, our helps both of men and monyes, are highly conſiderable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yours very little avaylable, for firſt, your par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is in a manner no party, at leaſt for the King, by reaſon the moſt and ſtrongeſt part thereof, if not all, conſiſts of Puritans and anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monarchiſts, ſuch as would, if it lay in their power, rather Conquer the kingdome for their holy brethren, the Parliamentaries, <hi>Scots,</hi> or <hi>Hollanders,</hi> then for his Majeſty. Next, if you had a conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant party, you have no proviſion if Come, victuals, men, or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyes, nor can you expect any, but from his Majeſties enemies, who will ſend you none, to ſerve againſt themſelves, all which is before ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:103654:9"/>
demonſtrated. How then are you prepared for a new warre, or how able to extirpate this Nation, if you intend not to bring in the parliament, or ſome other of your anti-monarchicall brethren, to winne the kingdome for themſelves, and weane it from his Majeſty? And what gets the King by that? mary, hee ſhall gayne an open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and looſe a kingdome. And, if for this end, the parliament help you not, they have ſmall encouragement to ſend you any more, ſo little effect have they found of the ſeverall aydes hetherto tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, which doth no way countervayle the bloud of ſo many thouſand men, and charge of ſo many hundred thouſand pounds, imployed; ſpent, and loſt, by Sea and Land to ſubdue, and extinguiſh this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which muſt very much diſcourage them, and retard their further adventures hether, having their heads &amp; hands full of worke at home. We know their ſpleene to <hi>Ireland</hi> over-flowes, and their deſire is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent, to joyne it as a large Canton to their new intended ſtate, framed after the <hi>Holland</hi> cut: Yet, for the preſent, their ambition is firſt, to ſettle it in <hi>England,</hi> and to ſecure themſelves, much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent, for charity begins at home; and they conceive, they may come time enough to play the after game in <hi>Ireland,</hi> for they aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, to have alwayes odde men lurking in our after points, to keepe the Tables open. It is hard then for you to truſt to their preſent ſupplyes ſo uncertaine, and if you doe, it is more hard for his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty to confide in you, for doubtleſſe, they will not relieve you, that you may ſuccour him, whom they ſo violently oppoſe, and labour to depoſe. Now I pray, give me leave a little further, to examine your vaunting victories, and therein to manifeſt the valour of our men, ſo much by you undervalued. The firſt encounter was (as you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but remember) betweene the bridge of <hi>Gillianſtone &amp; Smithstone,</hi> where a few of ours, with Swords and Skines onely, without ſhot defeated foure of five hundred of yours, armed as compleatly as any, Souldiers in <hi>Holland,</hi> where among was a Troupe of Horſe which ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved themſelves by their heeles, and about three hundred of the foote were ſlaine in the place, without ſhot or ſtroke in defence of their lives were the <hi>Iriſh</hi> then cowards? During the ſiege of <hi>Drogheda,</hi> (which though they were forced to rayſe, for want of Commanders, Armes, and Amunition) in the few encounters that were, they ſhewed their valour, even in ſtanding, and defending themſelves not being provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for offence, yet was your loſſe ſtill moſt. And did not our young Gentlemen enter the Towne, and therein ſufficiently demonſtrate their courage, though compelled to retyre, as you were at <hi>Roſſe.</hi> At <hi>Swoards, Finglas,</hi> and <hi>Santry,</hi> did not thirty or forty Musketires of ours, having not above three ſhots of powder a peece, with three or foure hundred Clubbetiers, confront a body of eight hundred ſhot of yours, beſide pike and horſe, and ſlay your Commanders, and ſixe for one of
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:103654:9"/>
your Souldiers, till want of powder did force their retreat, and give you way to murder a company of old labouring men, women, and children? At <hi>Kiljhalaghan,</hi> did not they the like, and kept the place alſo, for that time in deſpite of you, to your exceſſive loſſe? At <hi>Trim, Dundalke,</hi> and other petty skirmiſhes, you evermore loſt your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, and moſt of your Souldiers, neyther did you ever put ours to flight, while they had a ſhot of powder left, though you had ten Armes, for one of ours. At <hi>Kilruſh,</hi> I confeſſe we were as many men (I believe) as you, but your Artillery, Horſe, Armes, Amunition, triply exceeded ours, which are very great advantages, yet little got you by that day, but the field, which, with ſuch oddes, I hold for no great victory, which you had not the courage to proſecute. All ſuch Caſtles as you got from us (for the moſt part) coſt you deere, ten lives or more, for one, though you layd formall ſieges to them, with Artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, plenty of Amunition, and all other requiſites, againſt a few unar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med disfurniſhed men: Witneſſe <hi>Carrigmain, Baldugan, Suddain, Lynch</hi> his <hi>Knocke,</hi> and ſeverall other, where commonly, you moſt perfidiouſly broke your quarter given. All theſe were before the arrivall of any helpe of Commanders, Armes, or Amunition in our quarters, ſince when you have alwayes loſt ground, and recovered none; At <hi>Raconell</hi> you confeſſe our men fought valiantly, even with ſtones, when their powder was ſpent, the want whereof (it is evident) was the ſole cauſe of the defeat. At <hi>Loghleagh,</hi> you were ſhamefully beaten. At <hi>Roſſe</hi> we had our intent, which was to defend the Towne, though you got the field, by the advantage of your Artillery, and ſomewhat elſe, muſt not be ſpoken off. At <hi>Keſhenennan,</hi> being in all, not a full thouſand men, horſe and foote, very ſlightly provided, we kept the paſſage againſt your great Army of five or ſixe thouſand horſe and foote. At <hi>Clancur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> we had alſo our intent, which was to ſend you home, without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyance of us. At <hi>Portlester</hi> you got the worſt, as is aforeſaid. All ſuch Caſtles as we have gained from you, we wonne them (in a manner) without difficulty, blowes or loſſe; (<hi>Ballinikill</hi> onely excepted, which alſo held not out much more then halfe a day, after the firſt ſhot of a Cannon, though you vauntingly glorified it, with the name of invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible) yet in each of them, you abounded with men, and all other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary proviſion. Now in all theſe battles, encounters, skirmiſhes, and Caſtles wonne or loſt, it is particularly to bee noted, that you never gayned from us, without ſtiffe and ſtout reſiſtance, ſharpe blowes, and much loſſe, moſt commonly, and with much advantage, of Artillery, Armes, Amunition, and other warlike neceſſaries; whereas, whenſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we got from you, (I ſay for the moſt part) it was evermore without much oppoſition, damage, or bloud, with all kinde of diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of our ſide, which evidently demonſtrats whoſe men are moſt cowarded, or ſtood worſt. If we ſtill runne away, why did not you
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:103654:10"/>
over-runne and conquer the kingdome? And if a man armed onely with a Club, or a Gunne without powder, ſhould flye from another, compleatly armed, and provided to his hearts deſire, can any with reaſon therefore call that man a coward? I ſhould rather hold him for a Cullion, that purſues ſuch a man, or at leaſt, cannot wreſt his will, or winne his wiſh from him. If our men thus nakedly appointed, could hold play, for a whole yeare to yours plentifully furniſhed, while ſuccour was a comming, as it appeares they did, may they be nicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Cowards? rather the contrary: for all this proves manifeſtly, that you were very cowards, or they very valiant fellowes, and I thinke you will rather averre the later, then avow the former. How ever, I am certaine all Chriſtian Nations elſe will, and doe proclayme them valiant, yea <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> their moſt ſpleenative enemies; Prince <hi>Rupert</hi> will witneſſe it. And out of theſe premiſſes I deduce an infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſequence, two, or three, <hi>ergo</hi> our men and monyes are conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable; <hi>ergo</hi> it is dangerous for you in a new warre to hazard the loſſe of the kingdome, and utter extirpation of the proteſtant party; <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is better and ſafer for you, his Majeſty ſhould give content to this Nation, by giving his Royall aſſent to our propoſitions. But you ſay, it is not in his Majeſties power to condeſcend to our demands. If he ſhall, it will ſet popery againe in juriſdiction, introduce the Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie of <hi>Rome,</hi> and take away or endanger his Majeſties ſupreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, a diminution of honour and power not be endured. I anſwer, we deſire not the repealing of any ancient grounded lawes, but to be disburdened of certayne grievous preſſures layd on us, either by acts of ſtate, or parliament, or the lawleſſe Law of <hi>Sic volo, ſic jubeo</hi> fraudulently or violently enacted and executed, by the unſupportable tyranny of the miniſters of this ſubordinat governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, deſtructive to our Religion, lives and liberties, which, a free parliament with his Majeſties Royall aſſent can legally doe: therefore it lyes in his Majeſties power to grant our propoſitions. Doubtleſſe, you will acknowledge King <hi>Charles</hi> to be as lawfull, abſolut, &amp; power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a King of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland, tam de jure, quam de facto,</hi> as was <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>VIII.</hi> or <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>VI.</hi> Who (as it were at a blow) beat downe and ſuppreſſed a Religion of above eight hundred (or rather twelve hundred) yeares ſtanding, ſeazed on IESUS CHRISTS owne patrimony, the poſſeſſions of the Clergy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated their goods, ſacked and prophaned their Churches, &amp; in<note place="margin">VVhat fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, are the words of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Engliſh Author.</note> fine, turned above ten thouſand of them out of doores to ſeeke their fortunes, without being heard, or orderly convicted for any of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, contrary to all Law, conſcience, and common reaſon: For, the Abbeys hold their Lands in <hi>Franke Almoine,</hi> and in <hi>Fee,</hi> they were poſſeſſed of them, by the donation of ſeverall <hi>Saxon, Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Norman</hi> Kings, and Subjects, continued legally by preſcription,

All which were intended to prevent tyranny, and ſecure the Church then being, viſibly knowne, and generally reverenced: for to no other Church were they granted, neyther can any other enjoy them. Yet did <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, and <hi>Edward</hi> the ſixt aſſume the<note place="margin">Hetherto the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</note> power to controvert and ſubvert all theſe, which you approve and applaud, though they were acts ſurmounting the puiſance of heaven; and you will not allow King <hi>Charles</hi> the power of ordinary actions, and ſublunary things in our behalfes; albeit you avow his conſent gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the <hi>Scots</hi> (as aforeſaid) by act of parliament to pull downe Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, without whom a parliament is no parliament, In equity and reaſon, whatſoever Common-law may pretend to the contrary. His Majeſty by a publicke Declaration in Print declared the late Earle of <hi>Strafford</hi> innocent for matter of bloud, yet was he compelled after to ſubſcribe to the condemnation and decollation of the ſaid Earle to content the parliament of <hi>England,</hi> as yet inſatiably diſcontented. All theſe (I ſay) you approve and commend, and yet muſt his Majeſties hands be bound, and his gracious favours lockt up from us, under pretext (forſooth) of impoſſibilities in our demands, though they contayne nought, but what legally layes in his Majeſties Royall breſt to grant. As for your wonted childiſh foppery, which you call pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be ſet againe in juriſdiction, our propoſitions import (as you meane it) no ſuch thing; but that we may be allowed the freedome of the Roman Catholicke Religion, which hath here continued in ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction (if you know what meanes juriſdiction) above a thouſand yeares, maugre all your fiery furies, and perſecutions. And ſuppoſe it were in juriſdiction, as you underſtand it, no diſintereſſed judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can ſee what his Majeſty ſhould looſe thereby; his Rents and Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes would be ſtill the ſame, if not much more, by reaſon of the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of ingreſſe and egreſſe of trafficke, and the fidelity of Officers; he ſhould gayne a hundred hearts for one, both at home and abroad; he ſhould be obeyed and ſerved, as Father of the Common-weale, for love and filiall feare, not as he has beene hetherto by you, for lucre and intereſt, aſwell appeares by your now falling off from him, ſince the dayes of gayne are expired: for his proteſtant party here, is onely (as aforeſaid) in <hi>Dublin, Drogheda, Dundalke,</hi> and in thoſe quarters, where alſo now by a new treaſon lately diſcovered, they manifeſt the old treachery lay hidden in their hearts; and (to confirme what I have
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:103654:11"/>
above layd downe) on this diſcovery there were found but onely three Commanders in the whole Towne of <hi>Drogheda</hi> who ſtood for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty: And, if all the proteſtant pulſes in <hi>Dublin,</hi> or elſewhere in <hi>Ireland</hi> were felt by a skilfull Phyſitian in that kinde, I doubt, there would hardly be found a hundred free from that franticke feaver. As con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the introduction of the ſupremacy of <hi>Rome,</hi> which you object; it is well knowen, and we care not who knowes it, that all <hi>Ireland</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beleeved other; how then can that be intended to be introduced, that has never beene taken out of it? I ſay all <hi>Ireland;</hi> that is, all <hi>Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> whereof if a very few beleeved otherwiſe they were of a vipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous brood, deſtructive to their mother, and conſiderable, as none, in regard of the whole kingdome, as alſo ſuch <hi>Engliſh</hi> as here inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. With all, our propoſitions make no mention of any ſuch intended innovation. So as (ſuppoſe the Roman Catholicke Religion were freely exerciſed in <hi>Ireland,</hi> which is that we ſeeke) the ſupremacie in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, and the honour and power thereof, ſhould ſtill aſmuch as ever remayne in his Majeſty. Yet reflect but a little, and you may perceive, that his Majeſty has loſt that honour &amp; power you ſo much eſteeme, in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> (Oh that that were all!) for the parliament and <hi>Scots</hi> (if any they admit) attribut it to the <hi>Elders</hi> of their <hi>Kirke;</hi> but there is no corner in a Round-head for ſuch a ſupreme beliefe; it has place then onely in a few proteſtant heads (and fewer hearts, if they were all profoundly ſounded) in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> and as for the beliefe of Roman Catholicks in that kinde, it derogates not a ſingle haire from their faithfull and fixed allegeance to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, as is evident by their cleaving to him in his three kingdomes, now in theſe boyſterous times of his troubles, when all Sectaries flote in their fidelities, and flitt according their fancies. Moreover, what great diminution of honour or power (to uſe your owne words) ſhould his Majeſty thereby ſuſtaine, ſuppoſe the ſupremacy of <hi>Rome</hi> were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced? The world knowes (that knowes the Hiſtory of <hi>England</hi>) that the Crowne of <hi>England</hi> had more power, honour, fame &amp; wealth, before it aſſumed that ſeeming ſpecious Title, then it could ever ſince then, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, eyther at home or abroad. This needes no proofe, the Legend of the lives of the Monarchs thereof, does demonſtrate it. Had not <hi>Henry</hi> the <hi>VIII.</hi> morerenowne, by his Booke written againſt <hi>Luther</hi> in defence of the ſeven Sacraments, for which he received a Sword from the <hi>Pope,</hi> with the glorious Title of <hi>Defender</hi> of the <hi>Faith,</hi> then he had after, when his luſt lead him to arrogate the ſupremacy? and more treaſure had he in his Coffers, I am certaine. For, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the ſpoyle and pillage of the Church, whereof the value of the Lands onely <hi>England,</hi> at that time amounted to above three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty thouſand pounds ten ſhillings ſterling <hi>per annum,</hi> out of which the King tooke into his owne poſſeſſion, and appropriated
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:103654:11"/>
to the Crowne, a hundred ſixty one thouſand one hundred pounds <hi>per annum,</hi> beſides their moveables, which doubtleſſe made up a vaſt ſumme: yet died he without wealth, without honour, without friends, without peace in his houſe, or heart, and with remorſe of Conſcience belcheth forth his laſt breath in deſpayre, with an <hi>Omnia perdidimus:</hi> and can boaſt of no other Monument he hath left to Record his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, but ſuch as hee left, who vaunted of burning <hi>Dianas</hi> Temple. Now ſince then, can any man ſhew me the effects of the ſuppoſed ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or power, <hi>England</hi> has enjoyed or acquired, eyther forraine or do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſticke, by the ſupremacy, other then pride, luxury, epicuriſme, blaſphemy, effeminacy, and in a word, a licencious liberty to ſwim in ſin, and wallow in vice without controll? It is true indeed, there was a Duke went into <hi>Spaine, Basta.</hi> And to the Iſle of <hi>Ree, c'est aſsé. England</hi> has aſſiſted in this later age, <hi>Holland, Swedland,</hi> the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and other rebels againſt their naturall and lawfull Soveraignes, and has beene, and ſtill is cowed by that Nation, which it moſt ſcorned and vilipended of the world, and over which in former ages it was wont to domineere, crow, and conquer. It is lately become the forge of novelliſme and hereſie, the nurſery of Sects, and now the ſtage of rebellion. Theſe are the fruits of your goſling Goſpel, and the feats of honour and power, acted ſince the ſupremacie of <hi>Rome</hi> has beene expelled, and the inheritance of <hi>S. Peter</hi> intruded upon. <hi>France, Spaine Italy, Poland,</hi> and other Catholicke countries, ſtates and Provinces, who ſtill continue obedient children to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> eſteeme themſeves eyther in power, honour, wealth, or worldly ſplendour, no way inferiour to <hi>England;</hi> yea many of them farre exceede it in all. They are adored, beloved, awed at home and abroad; The <hi>Turkes, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens,</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> feare and feele the force of their armes; both ends of the world doe them homage, are tributary to them, and contribut to the farſſing of their Coffers. Yet doe they ſtill acknowledge <hi>Rome</hi> their ſuperiour in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, neyther have they any ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſpirituall juriſdiction, becauſe they know they are incapable thereof, and they deeme it rather a diminution, then any addition of honour or power to arrogat a Title which derogats from the power and juriſdiction eſſentially inhering in that Title, which they are aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red cannot be but in a Prieſt. So as this great <hi>Coloſſus</hi> of honour and power, <hi>Supremacy,</hi> in ſpirituall cauſes in a ſecular perſon, (the loſſe whereof you ſo much apprehend) is a meere <hi>ens rationis,</hi> and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently a thing not to be thought of by rationall men. Yet, if you will needes be ſo chymericall, as to contend <hi>de lanacaprina,</hi> take you it, ſo wee may have from the benignity of his gracious Majeſty his Royall aſſent to our humble propoſitions, which all good Subjects, and reall patriots are bound to wiſh and vote, it being the moſt efficacious meane to ſecure and ſuccour his Majeſty againſt the malignant party,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:103654:12"/>
and to ſettle this tottering kingdome in a firme and conſtant peace, whereto a raging malice to this Nation, with an undiſcreete anty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathicall zeale to the extirpation of the Religion thereof may rayſe many oppoſits. But let every man of both parties lay his hands on his heart, and ſadly conſider the ſtate of this kingdome, which lyes pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in a violent hecticke feaver: Its veines have beene ſuperaboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly vented. Too much phlebotomy drives the body into a conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption. If the flames ſhall once againe burſt forth, and the Sword be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unſheated betwixt us, without doubt nothing ſhall ever quench the one, or put up the other but the utter eradication and abolition of you and your Religion, or us and ours; and whether, no man but he that's God and man can tell. Can any then ſo farre deviate from the roade of reaſon, as to take their way where they are certayne to bee way laid, or in eminent danger of the loſſe of their purſes and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, while they may confidently walke other ſecure paths? Who can be ſo unwiſe, as to lay the foundation of ſo waighty a ſtructure, as is that of their Religion, lives, and fortunes, on floating ſands, while they may have firme and ſolid grounds to build on? I know not what will and rage may doe; but well, what wit and reaſon ſhould doe. Let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man therefore (I ſay) wipe off from the eye of his heart, all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionall animoſities, all over-weening conceits of proper might, all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall antypathies, all jealous diſtruſts, and every atom of any other paſſion, which may offuſcat the viſive powers from diſcerning what may moſt conduce to the recovery of our infirme Countrey, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, I wiſh each undividuall would put his helping head, heart, and hand without moroſity.</p>
               <p>This is better policy, then to keepe all in ſuſpenſe forſooth, to avoyd the blame of concluding any thing, and to ſpin out time, to ſee for whom the triumph will turne, or which way the game will goe, eyther for the King or Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo to runne with the good ſucceſſe, and to beate on the winners hand, or upon a ſhuffling up of the game, and an accommodation to betray this Nation, and take all advantages againſt it, as may well be collected and feared, out of theſe long ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious treaties, and frequent Ceſſations.

                  </hi> T'is to be feared, that theſe winding wyles and halting poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies may betray and looſe his Majeſty all his proteſtant party, ſo ready to ſlip after good ſucceſſe, whileſt the parliament ſhall winne more ſtedfaſt footing in <hi>North-VVales</hi> over againſt our Coaſts &amp; Harbours, whereby they may prevent the timely tranſportation of our ayde. It is dangerous to let a diſeaſe runne too farre, and a patient to worke and truſt too much to the ſtrength of his nature, leaſt all helps of Phyſicke come too late. You ſay, it is good to beare the <hi>Scots</hi> and other Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads in hand, till you be aſſured of the Confederates. You hover then in your reſolutions of adhering to his Majeſty, and you falter in your fidelity, ſeeing you hold correſpondence with his profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and oppoſe and reject thoſe, who (you know in your Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whereto I appeale) are his Majeſties beſt and trueſt Subjects, though they may not yeeld to ſuch conditions of peace, as you would put on them, without perpetuall ſlavery, infamy, and danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one day maſſacred. You preſume top much on the friendſhip and allyance ſome of your great ones have amongſt us, which you are beſt beware how you ſquiſe and wier-drawe too farre, leaſt you force us to forget all relations of bloud, and tyes of friendſhip, whereto Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Countrey muſt be preferred. Vnnaturall ſuits and quarrels, prove ſtill the moſt dangerous, and leaſt capable of reconciliation. Let not any thinke to rayſe or endeere themſelves to his Majeſty by extraordinary ſervices, in forcing the harder conditions on their Countrey, for they ſhall thereby loſe his Majeſty more hearts, then gayne heads and hands for his aſſiſtance, while you preſſe too much their perſons and Conſciences, and grate too deeply on their eſtates and purſes, they having ever beene and ſtill are too free and willing of themſelves, to ſupply his Majeſties neceſſities, to ſupport his glory and prerogatives, and advance his ſervice: though I may with a ſigh, ſay, they have beene evermore moſt unfortunat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in ſharing any part of the thankes of all their benevolous actions and large contributions from time to time, which the Governors of this kingdome did ſtill ſnatch and arrogat to themſelves, by magnifying their owne ende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and labours, interpoſed betweene the King and his people; as lately did the Lord of <hi>Strafford,</hi> who engroſſed all the honour and thankes of our profuſe Subſidies, and ingenuous willingneſſe to his Majeſties ſervice, to himſelfe; which may be a ſufficient precaution to us; and his fall from the ſtage, by over-acting his part, a lively preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to all others, for eviting ſuch a Tragicall end, which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Epilogue of all politicke playes. Let therfore all ſuch, as act thoſe eminent partes of Kings or Princes on the Theater of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale, enter into themſelves, and conſider, that albeit they perſonat
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:103654:13"/>
Princes, yet they are none, but fellow-players of the Globe or Fortune, and conſequently, both they and their poſterity, ſubject to ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences and preſſures, as they, by overmuch affectation of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, or other falter, ſhall have drawen on the reſt of the company. So as, when the play is done, thoſe momentall glorious Kings, may perhaps for ever after, be driven to act the Clowne, exull or pilgrim, aſwell as the meaneſt of their companions, which God avert from all well meaning ſervitures, whoſe ſincere intentions and radiant Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, will in fine (I hope) ſhine thorough the the thick eſt of theſe Egyptiacall cloudes, which hang over our Hemiſphere, and diſperſe all malignant vapours and vipers, which will vaniſh thoroughout the Kingdome, like falſe appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or ſpecters, upon a true vnion &amp; under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding betweene the King and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, wherto, may propitious hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen ſay, Amen.</p>
