            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Nor then did he spread Papers abroad, but onely delivered a very few Copies to speciall friends, and this not with an intent to Calumniate the Bishop.</hi> &amp;c. <hi>A. C. in his Preface before his Relation of this Conference.</hi> Truly, I knew of no Reports then given out to the prejudice of the <hi>Jesuite's</hi> either Person, or Cause; I was in a Corner of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, where I heard little: But howsoever, here's a most plaine Confession by <hi>A.

Why <hi>he did but deliver Copies.</hi> Why, but doth not he that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Copies (for Instance, of a <hi>Libell)</hi> spread it? Yea, <hi>but he delivered but a very few Copies.</hi> Be it so: I doe not say, How many he spred. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses the <hi>Iesuite</hi> delivered some, though very few; And he that delivers any, spreads it abroad. For what can he tell, when the Copies are once out of his power, how many may Copie them out, and spread them farther? Yea, <hi>but he delivered them to spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall friends.</hi> Be it so too: The more speciall friends they were to him, the lesse indifferent would they be to me, perhaps my more speciall Enemies. Yea, <hi>but all this was without an intent to Calumniate me.</hi> Well. Be that so too. But if I be Calumniated thereby, his <hi>Intention</hi> will not helpe it. And whether the Copies, which he delivered, have not in them Calumny against me, I leave to the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Reader</hi> of this Discourse to Iudge.</note> 
               <hi>hee spred abroad Papers of this Conference, full</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:13491:4"/>
               <hi>enough of partiality to his Cause, and more full of Calumny against me.</hi> Hereupon I was in a manner forced to give M. <hi>Fisher's Relation</hi> of the Conference an <hi>Answer,</hi> and to publish it. Though for some <hi>Reasons,</hi> and those then approved <hi>by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> it was thought fit I should set it out in my Chaplain's Name, <hi>R.

            <p>There was a Cause also, why at the first, the <hi>Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course upon this Conference</hi> stayed so long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it could endure to be pressed. For the <hi>Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> was in <hi>May, 1622.</hi> And M. <hi>Fisher's</hi> Paper was scattered and made common, so common, that a <hi>Copy</hi> was brought to mee <hi>(being none of his spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall friends)</hi> before <hi>Michaelmas.</hi> And yet this <hi>Discourse</hi> was not printed till <hi>Aprill, 1624.</hi> Now that you may know how this happened, I shall say for my selfe, It was not my <hi>Idlenesse,</hi> nor my <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingnesse</hi> to right both my selfe, and the Cause, against the <hi>Jesuite,</hi> and the <hi>Paper,</hi> which he had spred, that occasion'd this delay. For I had then <hi>Most Honourable VVitnesses,</hi> and have some yet living, That this <hi>Discourse</hi> (such as it was, when <hi>A. C.</hi> nibled at it) was finished long before I could perswade my selfe to let it come into Publike View. And this was caused partly by my owne <hi>Backwardnesse</hi> to deale with these men, whom I have ever observed to be great Pretenders for <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>Unity,</hi> but yet such as will admit nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:13491:4"/>
unlesse <hi>They</hi> and their <hi>Faction</hi> may prevaile in all; As if no <hi>Reformation</hi> had beene necessary. And <hi>partly</hi> because there were about the same time <hi>three Conferences</hi> held with <hi>Fisher.</hi> Of these this was the <hi>Third;</hi> And could not therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently come abroad into the world, till the two former were ready to leade the way, which till that time, they were not.</p>
            <p>And this is in part the Reason also, why this <hi>Tract</hi> crept into the end of a larger Worke. For since that Worke contained in a manner the substance of all that passed in the <hi>two former Conferences:</hi> And that this Third in divers points concurred with them, and depended on them, I could not thinke it <hi>Substantive</hi> enough, to stand alone. But besides this <hi>Affinity</hi> betweene the Conferences, I was willing to have it passe as silent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as it might, at the end of another Worke, and so perhaps little to be looked after, because I could not hold it worthy, nor can I yet, of that Great Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Service, which I owe to my Deare Mother, <hi>the Church of England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a cause also, why it lookes now abroad againe with <hi>Alteration</hi> and <hi>Addition.</hi> And 'tis fit I should give your <hi>Majesty</hi> an Account of that too. This <hi>Tract</hi> was first printed in the yeare 1624. And in the yeare 1626. another <hi>Jesuite,</hi> or the same, under the name of <hi>A. C.</hi> printed a Relation of this <hi>Conference,</hi> and therein tooke Exceptions to some
<pb facs="tcp:13491:5"/>
Particulars, and endeavoured to Confute some Things deliver'd therein by me. Now being in yeares, and unwilling to dye in the <hi>Jesuites</hi> debt, I have in this <hi>Second Edition</hi> done as much for him, and somewhat more. For he did but skip up and downe, and labour to pick a hole, here, and there, where he thought he might fasten, and where it was too hard for him, let it alone. But I have gone <hi>thorough</hi> with him; And I hope, given him a full Confutation: or at least such a <hi>Bone</hi> to gnaw, as may shake his teeth, if he looke not to it. And of my <hi>Addition to this Discourse,</hi> this is the Cause; But of my <hi>Alteration</hi> of some things in it, this. <hi>A. C.</hi> his Curiosity to <hi>winnow</hi> me, made me in a more curious manner fall to <hi>sifting</hi> of my selfe, and that which had formerly past my <hi>Penne.</hi> And though (I blesse God for it) I found no cause to alter anything that belonged either to the <hi>Substance,</hi> or <hi>Course</hi> of the Conference: Yet somewhat I did finde, which needed better, and <hi>cleerer expression;</hi> And <hi>that</hi> I have <hi>altered,</hi> well knowing I must ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect <hi>Curious Observers</hi> on all hands.</p>
            <p>Now, Why this <hi>Additionall Answer</hi> to the <hi>Relation of A. C.</hi> came no sooner forth, hath a Cause too, and I shall truly represent it. <hi>A. C. his Relation of the Conference,</hi> was set out. 1626. I knew not of it in some yeares after. For it was printed among divers other things of like nature, either by M. <hi>Fisher</hi> himselfe, or his friend <hi>A. C.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:13491:5"/>
When I saw it, I read it over carefully, and found myselfe not a little wrong'd in it, but the <hi>Church of England,</hi> and indeed the <hi>Cause of Religion</hi> much more. I was before this time by <hi>Your Majesties Great Grace,</hi> and undeserved favour made <hi>Deane of Your Majesties Chappell Royall,</hi> and a <hi>Counsellor of State,</hi> and hereby, as the Occasions of those times were, made too much a Stranger to my <hi>Bookes.</hi> Yet for all my Busie Imployments, it was still in my Thoughts to give <hi>A. C.</hi> an Answer. But then I fell into a most dangerous <hi>Feaver;</hi> And though it pleased God beyond all hope to restore mee to health, yet long I was before I recover'd such strength as might ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mee to undertake such a Service. And since that time, how I have beene detained, and in a manner forced upon other <hi>many, various,</hi> and <hi>Great Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions,</hi> your <hi>Majesty</hi> knowes best. And how of late I have beene used by the <hi>Scandalous</hi> and <hi>Scurrilous Pennes</hi> of some bitter men (whom I heartily beseech God to forgive) the world knowes; Little Leasure, and lesse Encouragement given me to Answer a <hi>Iesuite,</hi> or set upon other Services, while I am under the <hi>Prophets</hi> affliction.

This they thought would vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate my Reputation, were it generally knowne to be mine. I Confesse I looked round about these Men, and their <hi>Motion;</hi> And at last, my Thoughts working much upon themselves, I began to perswade my selfe, that I had beene too long diverted from this necessary Worke. And that perhaps there might be <hi>In voce hominum, Tuba Dei,</hi> in the still voice of men, the Loud Trumpet of God, which sounds many wayes, sometimes to the eares, and sometimes to the hearts of men, and by meanes which they thinke not of. And as <note n="*" place="margin">

That it is never silent, is his great <hi>Mercy;</hi> and that it is not alwayes heard, is not the least of our <hi>Misery.</hi> Vpon this Motion I tooke time to deliberate: And had scarce time for that, much lesse for the Worke. Yet at last to every of these men I gave this Answer. That M. <hi>Fisher,</hi> or <hi>A. C.</hi> for him, had beene busie with my former Discourse, and that I would never reprint that, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse I might gaine time enough to. Answer that, which <hi>A. C.</hi> had charged a fresh both upon mee, and the Cause. While my Thoughts were thus at
<pb facs="tcp:13491:6"/>
worke, <hi>Your Majesty</hi> fell upon the <hi>same Thing,</hi> and was graciously pleased not to <hi>Command,</hi> but to <hi>VVish</hi> me to reprint this <hi>Conference,</hi> and in mine <hi>own Name;</hi> And this openly at the <hi>Councel-Table</hi> in <hi>Michaelmas-Terme. 1637.</hi> I did not hold it fit to deny, having in all the Course of my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice obayed your Majesties Honourable, and Just <hi>Motions,</hi> as <hi>Commands:</hi> But Craved leave to shew what little leasure I had to doe it, and what In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences might attend upon it. When this did not serve to excuse mee, I humbly submitted to that, which I hope was <hi>Gods Motion in Your Majesties.</hi> And having thus layd all that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes this <hi>Discourse</hi> before your <hi>Gracious and most Sacred Majesty,</hi> I most humbly present you with the <hi>Booke</hi> it selfe, which as I heartily pray You to protect, so doe I wholly submit it to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> with my Prayers for Her Prosperity, and my Wishes that I were able to doe Her better Service.</p>
            <p>I have thus acquainted <hi>Your Majesty</hi> with all Occasions, which both formerly, and now againe have led this <hi>Tract</hi> into the light. In all which I am a faithfull Relater of all Passages, but am not very well satisfied, who is now my <hi>Adversary. M. Fisher</hi> was at the <hi>Conference.</hi> Since that, I finde <hi>A. C.</hi> at the <hi>print.</hi> And whether These be two, or but One <hi>Jesuite,</hi> I know not; since scarce <hi>One</hi> amongst them, goes under <hi>One Name.</hi> But
<pb facs="tcp:13491:7"/>
for my owne part (and the <hi>Error</hi> is not great, if I mistake) I thinke they are <hi>One,</hi> and that One, <hi>M. Fisher.</hi> That which induces me to thinke so, is <hi>First,</hi> the Great Inwardnesse of <hi>A. C.</hi> with <hi>M. Fisher,</hi> which is so great, as may well be thought to neighbour upon <hi>Identity. Secondly,</hi> the <hi>Stile of A. C.</hi> is so like <hi>M. Fishers,</hi> that I doubt it was but one and the <hi>same hand</hi> that moov'd the penne. <hi>Thirdly, A. C.</hi> sayes expresly <hi>That the Jesuite himselfe made the Relation of the first</hi> 
               <note place="margin">A. C. p. 67.</note> 
               <hi>Conference with D. VVhite:</hi> And in the <hi>Title Page</hi> of the Worke, <hi>That</hi> Relation as well as <hi>This,</hi> is said to be made by <hi>A.

            <p>Now if it be <hi>M. Fisher</hi> himselfe, under the Name of <hi>A. C.</hi> then what needs these <note n="*" place="margin">Preface to the Relation of this Conference by <hi>A. C.</hi>

Now as I would humbly Beseech <hi>Your Majesty</hi> to keepe a serious Watch upon these <hi>Fisher-men,</hi> which pretend S. <hi>Peter,</hi> but fish not with <hi>His Net:</hi> So would I not have You neglect another sort of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers</hi> in a Shallower Water. For they have some <hi>ill Nets</hi> too. And if they may spread them, when, and where they will, God knowes what may become of it. These have not so strong a <hi>Backe</hi> abroad, as the <hi>Romanists</hi> have, but that's no Argument to suffer them to encrease. They may grow to equall <hi>Strength</hi> with <hi>Number.</hi> And <hi>Factious People</hi> at home, of what <hi>Sect,</hi> or <hi>fond Opinion</hi> soever they be, are not to be neglected. <hi>Partly,</hi> because they are so <hi>Neare.</hi> And 'tis ever a dangerous Fire, that begins in the <hi>Bed-straw.</hi> And <hi>partly</hi> because all those <hi>Domesticke Evills,</hi> which threaten a <hi>Rent</hi> in <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>State</hi> are with far more safety pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by <hi>VVisdome,</hi> then punished by <hi>Justice.</hi> And would men consider it right, they are far more beholding to that man, that keepes them from falling, then to him that takes them up, though it be to set the <hi>Arme</hi> or the <hi>Leg</hi> that's broken in the Fall.</p>
            <p>In this <hi>Discourse</hi> I have no aime to displease any, nor any hope to please all. If I can helpe on to <hi>Truth</hi> in the Church, and the Peace of the Church together, I shall be glad, be it in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure. Nor shall I spare to speake <hi>Necessary Truth,</hi> out of too much Love of <hi>Peace.</hi> Nor thrust on Vnnecessary Truth to the Breach of that <hi>Peace,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:13491:8"/>
which once broken is not so easily soder'd againe. And if for <hi>Necessary Truths</hi> sake onely, any man will be offended, nay take, nay snatch at that offence, which is not given, I know no fence for that. 'Tis <hi>Truth,</hi> and I must tell it. 'Tis the <hi>Gospell,</hi> and I must preach it. 1 Cor. 9. And far safer it is in this <note place="margin">1 Cor. 9. 16.</note> Case to beare <hi>Anger</hi> from men, then a <hi>VVoe</hi> from God.

            <p>The <hi>Church of Christ</hi> upon Earth may bee compared to a <hi>Hive of Bees,</hi> and that can bee no where so steddily placed in this world, but it will be in some danger. And men that care neither for the <hi>Hive,</hi> nor the <hi>Bees,</hi> have yet a great minde to the <hi>Honey.</hi> And having once tasted the sweet of the <hi>Churches Maintenance</hi> swallow that for
<pb facs="tcp:13491:9"/>
               <hi>Honey,</hi> which one day will be more bitter then <hi>Gall</hi> in their Bowells. Now the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Priest,</hi> more then any other, are bound to looke to the <hi>Integrity</hi> of the Church in <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> and that in the <hi>first</hi> place. For that's by farre the <hi>Best Honey</hi> in the <hi>Hive.</hi> But in the <hi>second</hi> place, They must be Carefull of the <hi>Churches Maintenance</hi> too, els the <hi>Bees</hi> shall make <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> for others, and have none left for their owne ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary sustenance, and then all's lost. For we see it in daily and common use, that the <hi>Honey</hi> is not taken from the <hi>Bees,</hi> but they are destroyed first. Now in this great and Busie Worke, the <hi>King</hi> and the <hi>Priest</hi> must not feare to put their hands to the <hi>Hive,</hi> though they be sure to be <hi>stung.</hi> And stung by the <hi>Bees,</hi> whose <hi>Hive</hi> and House they preserve. It was <hi>King Davids</hi> Case (God grant it be never <hi>Yours.)

               <hi>like Bees,</hi> This was hard usage enough, yet some <hi>profit,</hi> some <hi>Honey</hi> might thus be gotten in the End. And that's the <hi>Kings</hi> Case. But when it comes to the <hi>Priest,</hi> the Case is alter'd, They come about him like <hi>VVaspes,</hi> or like Hornets rather, all <hi>sting,</hi> and no <hi>Honey</hi> there. And all this many times for no <hi>offence,</hi> nay sometimes for <hi>Service</hi> done them, would they see it.

            <p>Now <hi>one Thing</hi> more let me be bold to Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to <hi>Your Majesty</hi> in particular, concerning Your Great Charge, the <hi>Church of England.</hi> 'Tis in an hard Condition.

The plaine truth is, She is between these two Factions, as betweene two <hi>Milstones,</hi> and unlesse <hi>Your Majesty</hi> looke to it, to <hi>VVhose Trust</hi> She is committed, Shee'll be grownd to <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> to an irrepairable both Dishonour, and losse to this <hi>Kingdome.</hi> And 'tis very Remarkeable, that while both these presse hard upon the <hi>Church of England,</hi> both of them Crye out upon <hi>Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> like froward Children, which <hi>scratch,</hi> and <hi>kicke,</hi> and <hi>bite,</hi> and yet crye out all the while, as if themselves were killed.

            <p>Much <hi>talking</hi> there is <hi>(Bragging,</hi> Your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty may call it) on both sides.

Shee may not revise that which in any Case hath slipt by Her. What Successe this <hi>Great Distemper,</hi> caused by the Collision of two such <hi>Factions,</hi> may have, I know not, I cannot <hi>Prophesie.</hi> This I know, That the use which Wise men should make of other mens <hi>falles,</hi> is not to fall with them; And the use, which <hi>Pious and Religious men</hi> should make of these great <hi>Flawes in Christianity,</hi> is not to <hi>Joyne</hi> with them that make them, nor to helpe to dislocate those maine <hi>Bones</hi> in the <hi>Body,</hi> which being once put out of <hi>Ioynt,</hi> will not easily be <hi>set</hi> againe.

               <hi>Besides:</hi> This I have ever Observed, That many <hi>Rigid Professors</hi> have turn'd <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes,</hi> and in that Turne have beene <hi>more Iesui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> then any other: And such <hi>Romanists</hi> as have chang'd from them, have for the most part quite leaped over the <hi>Meane,</hi> and beene as <hi>Rigid</hi> the other way, as <hi>Extremity</hi> it selfe. And this, if there be not both <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>VVisdome</hi> to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne it, is a very <hi>Naturall Motion.</hi> For a Man is apt to thinke he can never runne farre enough from that, which he once begins to hate; And doth not
<pb facs="tcp:13491:11"/>
Consider therewhile, That where <hi>Religion Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted</hi> is the thing he hates, a <hi>Fallacy</hi> may easily be put upon him. For he ought to hate the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> which depraves <hi>Religion,</hi> and to runne from it: but from <hi>no part of Religion</hi> it selfe, which he ought to Love, and Reverence, ought hee to depart. And this I have <hi>Observed</hi> farther: That no One thing hath made <hi>Conscientious men</hi> more wavering in their owne mindes, or more apt, and easie to be drawne aside from the sincerity of <hi>Religion professed in the Church of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> then the Want of <hi>Uniforme</hi> and <hi>Decent Order</hi> in too many Churches of the <hi>Kingdome.</hi> And the <hi>Romanists</hi> have beene apt to say, <hi>The Houses of God</hi> could not be suffer'd to lye so <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stily</hi> (as in some places they have done) were the <hi>True worship of God</hi> observed in them: Or did the People thinke that such it were. 'Tis true, the <hi>Inward VVorship</hi> of the Heart, is the <hi>Great Service of God,</hi> and no Service acceptable with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it: But the <hi>Externall worship of God</hi> in his Church is the <hi>Great VVitnesse</hi> to the World, that Our heart stands right in that <hi>Service of God.</hi> Take this away, or bring it into Contempt, and <hi>what Light is there left to shine before men, that they may see our Devotion, and glorifie our Father which is in Heaven?</hi> And to deale clearely with <hi>Your Majesty,</hi> These <hi>Thoughts</hi> are they, and no other, which have made me labour so much, as I have done, for <hi>Decency</hi> and an
<pb facs="tcp:13491:12"/>
Orderly settlement of the <hi>Externall Worship of God in the Church.</hi> For of that which is <hi>Inward</hi> there can be no <hi>Witnesse</hi> among men, nor no <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample</hi> for men. Now no Externall Action in the world can be <hi>Uniforme</hi> without some <hi>Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi> And these in <hi>Religion,</hi> the <hi>Ancienter</hi> they bee, the better, so they may fit <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Place. Too many</hi> Over-burden the <hi>Service of God;</hi> And <hi>too</hi> few leave it naked. And scarce any Thing hath hurt <hi>Religion</hi> more in these broken Times, then an Opinion in too many men, That because <hi>Rome</hi> had thrust some Vnnecessary, and many Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Ceremonies upon the Church, therefore the <hi>Reformation</hi> must have none at all; Not considering therewhile, That <hi>Ceremonies</hi> are the <hi>Hedge</hi> that fence the <hi>Substance of Religion</hi> from all the Indignities, which <hi>Prophanenesse</hi> and <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> too Commonly put upon it. And a Great Weaknesse it is, not to see the strength which <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies</hi> (Things weake enough in themselves, God knowes) adde even to <hi>Religion</hi> it selfe; But a farre greater to see it, and yet to Cry Them downe, all, and without Choyce, by which their most hated Adversaries climb'd up, and could not crie up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and their cause, as they doe, but by them. And <hi>Divines</hi> of all the rest might learne, and teach this <hi>VVisdome</hi> if they would, since they see all other <hi>Professions,</hi> which helpe to beare downe their <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies,</hi> keepe up their owne therewhile, and that to the highest.</p>

                  </note> And after this he chargeth him with <hi>Obstinacy</hi> and <hi>Presumption.</hi> I hope this is plaine enough to shew, that S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had no great Opinion of the <hi>Romane Infallibility.</hi> Or if he had it, when he writ to <hi>Cornelius;</hi> certainely hee had chang'd it, when he wrote against <hi>Stephen.</hi> But I think it was no change, and that when he wrote to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> it was <hi>Rhetoricke,</hi> and no more.</p>
               <p>Now if any man shall say, that in this Poynt of <hi>Rebaptization,</hi> S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> himselfe was in the wrong Opinion, and Pope <hi>Stephen</hi> in the right, I easily grant that; But yet that Error of his takes not off his judgement, what he thought of the <hi>Papall or Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Infallibility</hi> in those times.

                  <hi>were translated by him, and delivered to the simple people of the Church of Rome, that by his meanes they might loose the verity of the Faith, which they had learned from the Apostle.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Praestigiae</hi> before mentioned were the Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Illusions of <hi>Ruffinus,</hi> putting <hi>Origen's</hi> Book un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Martyr Pamphilus</hi> his name, that so he might bring in <hi>Heresie</hi> the more cunningly under a name of Credit, and the more easily pervert the Peoples Faith. So, of the <hi>Faith</hi> he speakes. And secondly, I shall as easily confesse that S. <hi>Ierome's</hi> speech is most true, but I cannot admit the <hi>Cardinal's</hi> sense of it. For he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses upon the word <hi>Fides.</hi> For by <hi>Romana Fides,</hi>
                  <pb n="10" facs="tcp:13491:18"/>
the <hi>Romane Faith,</hi> he will understand the <hi>Particular Church of Rome.</hi> Which is as much as to say, <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos Fideles,</hi> the Faithfull of that Church: And that no wilie Delusions, or Cousenage in matter of Faith can be imposed upon them. Now hereupon I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to that of S. <hi>Cyprian:</hi> If <hi>Fides Romana</hi> must signifie <hi>Fideles Romanos,</hi> why may not <hi>Perfidia</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore signifie <hi>Perfidos?</hi> Especially since these two words are commonly used by these <hi>Writers,</hi> as <hi>Termes</hi>

                  <hi>Opposite.</hi> And therefore by the <hi>Law of Opposition</hi> may interpret each other proportionably. So with these great Masters, with whom 'tis almost growne to be, <hi>Quod volumus, rectum est,</hi> what we please, shall be the Authours meaning: <hi>Perfidia</hi> must signifie abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely <hi>Errour in Faith,</hi> or <hi>Misbeliefe:</hi> But <hi>Fides</hi> must relate to the <hi>Persons,</hi> and sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the <hi>Faithfull of the Romane Church.</hi> And now I conceive my Answer will proceed with a great deale of Reason. For <hi>Romana Fides,</hi> the Romane Faith, as it was commended by the Apostle (of which S. <hi>Ierome</hi> speakes) is one thing, and the <hi>Particular Romane Church,</hi> of which the <hi>Cardinall</hi> speakes, is another. The <hi>Faith</hi> indeed admits not <hi>Praestigias,</hi> wilie delusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons into it; if it did, it could not be the <hi>Whole and Vndefiled Faith of Christ,</hi> which they learned from the <hi>Apostle.</hi> And which is so fenced by <hi>Apostolicall Authority,</hi> as that it cannot be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, though an Angell should preach the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But the <hi>Particular Church of Rome</hi> hath admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <hi>Praestigias,</hi> diverse crafty Conveyances into the <hi>Faith,</hi> and is not fenced, as the <hi>Faith it selfe</hi> is. And therefore though an <hi>Angell</hi> cannot contrary
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:13491:18"/>
that, yet the <hi>bad Angell</hi> hath sowed tares in this. By which meanes <hi>Romana Fides,</hi> though it be now the same it was for the <hi>words</hi> of the <hi>Creed;</hi> yet it is not the same for the <hi>sense</hi> of it: Nor for the <hi>super</hi> and <hi>praeter-structures</hi> built upon it, or joyned unto it. So the <hi>Romane Faith,</hi> that is, the <hi>Faith</hi> which S. <hi>Paul</hi> taught the <hi>Romanes,</hi> and after commended in them, was all one with the <hi>Catholike Faith of Christ.</hi> For S. <hi>Paul</hi> taught no other than that <hi>One.</hi> And this one can never be changed in, or from it selfe by <hi>Angell</hi> or <hi>Divell.</hi> But in mens hearts it may receive a change; And in particular Churches it may receive a change; And in the <hi>particular Church of Rome</hi> it hath received a change. And yee see S. <hi>Hierome</hi> himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses, that the <hi>Pope</hi> himselfe was afraid <note n="b" place="margin">Ne fidei veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem quam ab Apostolo didice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, per te per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derent, ut suprà.</note>

                  <hi>Words of the Creed, this I thinke fit to warne you of. That in divers Churches some things are found added to the words</hi> (of the Creed.) <hi>But in the Church of the City of Rome, this is not found done. And as I thinke, it is, for that no Haeresie did take its rise or beginning there: And for that the old Custome is there observed, Namely, that they which are to receive the grace of Baptisme, doe publikely repeate the Creed in the hearing of the People, who would not admit such Additions. But in other places (as farre as I can understand) by reason of some Hereticks, some things were added, but such as were to exclude the sense of their Novell Doctrine.</hi> Now these words make little for <hi>Bellarmine</hi> who cites them, and much against <hi>Ruffinus</hi> that uttered them. They make little for <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> First, because suppose <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his speech to be true, yet this will never follow: In <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his time no <hi>Haeresie</hi> had taken its beginning at <hi>Rome:</hi> therefore no <hi>Haeresie</hi> hath had rooting there so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny hundred yeares since. Secondly, <hi>Bellarmine</hi> takes upon him there to proove <hi>That the particular Church of Rome cannot erre.</hi> Now neither can this be concluded out of <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his words. First, because (as I said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore) to argue from <hi>Non sumpsit</hi> to <hi>Ergo sumere non po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test:</hi> No <hi>Haeresie</hi> hath yet begun there; therefore none can begin there, or spring thence, is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawne <hi>Ab actu ad Potentiam negative,</hi> from the Act to the Power of Being, which every No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in Learning can tell proceeds not <hi>Negatively.</hi> And Common Reason telles every man, 'tis no Consequence to say, Such a thing is not, or hath not beene, Therefore it cannot be. Secondly, because though it were true, that no <hi>Haeresie</hi> at all did ever take its beginning at <hi>Rome,</hi> yet that can never proove <hi>that the particular Church of Rome can never erre</hi> (which is the thing in Question.) For suppose that no <hi>Hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie</hi>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:13491:20"/>
did ever beginne there, yet if any, that began els<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, were admitted into that Church, it is as full a proofe, <hi>That that Church can erre,</hi> as if the <hi>Haeresie</hi> had beene hatched in that Nest. For that Church erres, which <hi>admits an Haeresie into it,</hi> as well as that which <hi>broaches</hi> it. Now <hi>Ruffinus</hi> sayes no more of the <hi>Romane Church,</hi> then <hi>non sumpsit exordium</hi> no Heresie tooke its beginning there; but that denyes not, but that some Haereticall taint might get in there. And 'tis more then manifest, that the most famous Haeresies in their severall Times made their aboade even at <hi>Rome.</hi> And 'tis observable too, that <hi>Bellarmine</hi> cites nomore of <hi>Ruffinus</hi> his words then these <hi>(In Ecclesiâ urbis Romae neque Haeresis ulla sumpsit exordium, &amp; mos ibi servatur antiquus)</hi> as if this were an entire speech, whereas it comes in but as a Reason given of the speech precedent, and as if <hi>Ruffinus</hi> made the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> the great observer of the Customes of the Church, whereas he speaks but of one Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Custome of <hi>Reciting the Creed before Baptisme.</hi> But after all this, I pray did <hi>no Heresie</hi> ever begin at <hi>Rome?</hi> where did <hi>Novatianisme</hi> begin?

If <hi>His Majestie</hi> did say it, there is <hi>Truth</hi> in the speech; The error is yours only, by mistaking what is meant by <hi>Loosing the Holy Ghost.</hi> For a <hi>Particular Church</hi> may be said to loose the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> two wayes, or in two Degrees. 1. The one, when it looses such speciall as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistance of that Blessed Spirit, as preserves it from all dangerous Errors, and sinnes, and the temporall pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, which is due unto them: And in this sense the <hi>Greeke Church did perhaps loose the Holy Ghost:</hi> for they erred against Him, they sinned against God, And for this, or other sinnes, they were delivered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another <hi>Babylonish Captivity</hi> under the <hi>Turke,</hi> in which they yet are; and from which, God in his mercy deliver them. But this is rather to be called an Error <hi>circa Spiritum Sanctum,</hi> about the Doctrine
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13491:24"/>
concerning the Holy Ghost, then an error against the Holy Ghost. 2. The other is, when it looses not only this assistance, but all assistance <hi>ad hoc,</hi> to this, that they may remaine any longer a <hi>true Church;</hi> and so, <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and divers other Churches have <hi>lost the Holy Ghost.</hi> But in this sense the whole <hi>Greeke Church</hi> lost not the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi> For they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue a true Church in the maine substance, to and at this day, though erroneous in this Poynt, which you mention, and perhaps in some other too.</p>

things that are <hi>de modo,</hi> of the <hi>manner of being,</hi> arc of <hi>Faith.</hi> But in plaine truth, this is no more, then if you should say, some things are <hi>Fundamentall</hi> in the <hi>faith,</hi> and some are not.

                  <hi>Bellarmine</hi> fals quite off in this, and confesses in expresse termes, <hi>That nothing can be certaine by Certainty of Faith, unlesse it be contained immediately in the Word of God: Or be deduced out of the Word of God by evident Consequence.</hi> And if <hi>nothing</hi> can be so certaine, then certainly no <hi>Determination of the Church it selfe,</hi> if that Determination be not grounded upon one of these: either expresse Word of God, or evident Consequence out of it. So here's little Agreement in this great Point betweene <hi>Stapleton</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine.</hi> Nor can this be shifted off, as if <hi>Stapleton</hi> spake of the <hi>Word of God written,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> of the <hi>Word of God unwritten</hi> (as he cals <hi>Tradition.)</hi> For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> treats there of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge which a man hath of the Certainty of his owne Salvation. And I hope <hi>A. C.</hi> will not tell us, There's any <hi>Tradition</hi> extant unwritten, by which <hi>particular men</hi> may have assurance of their severall Salvations. Therefore <hi>Bellarmine's</hi> whole Disputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there is quite beside the matter: Or els he must speake of the <hi>Written Word,</hi> and so lie crosse to <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton,</hi> as is mention'd.

Nay I must say in this case, that the one Determination is firme by Divine Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but the other hath no Divine Revelation at all, but the Churches Authority onely.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, I cannot believe neither, <hi>That all Determinations of the Church are sufficiently applied by one and the same full Authority of the Church.</hi> For the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13491:33"/>
Authority of the Church, though it be of the same fulnesse in regard of it self, and of the Power, which it commits to <hi>Generall Councels</hi> lawfully called: yet it is not alwayes of the same fulnesse of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and sufficiency: nor of the same fulnesse of Conscience, and integrity to apply <hi>Dogmata Fidei,</hi> that which is Dogmaticall in the Faith. For instance, I thinke you dare not deny but the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> was lawfully called, and yet I am of opinion, that few, even of your selves, believe that the <hi>Councell of Trent</hi> hath the same fulnesse with the <hi>Councell of Nice,</hi> in all the fore-named kinds, or degrees of ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. Thirdly, suppose <hi>That all Determinations of the Church are made firme to us by one and the same Divine Revelation, and sufficiently applied by one and the same full Authority;</hi> yet it will not follow, that they are all alike <hi>Fundamentall in the Faith.</hi> For I hope <hi>A. C.</hi> himselfe will not say, that the <hi>Definitions</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> are in better condition, than the <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions of Canonicall Scripture.</hi> Now all <hi>Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Canonicall Scripture</hi> are alike <hi>firme,</hi> because they all alike proceed from <hi>Divine Revelation:</hi> but they are not all alike <hi>Fundamentall in the Faith.</hi> For this <hi>Proposition</hi> of <hi>Christ</hi> to S. <hi>Peter,</hi> and S. <hi>Andrew, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men</hi> 
                  <note n="a" place="margin">S. Matth. 4. 19</note>, is as firm a Truth, as that which he delivered to his Disciples, <hi>That he must die, and rise againse the third day</hi> 
                  <note n="b" place="margin">S. Matth. 16. 21</note>. For both proceed from the same <hi>Divine Revelation,</hi> out of the mouth of our Saviour, and both are sufficiently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by one and the same full Authority of the Church, which receives the whole Gospell of S. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew</hi> to be <hi>Canonicall</hi> and <hi>infallible Scripture.</hi> And yet both these <hi>Propositions</hi> of Christ are not alike <hi>Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall</hi> in the Faith. For I dare say, No man shall be saved (in the ordinary way of salvation) that believes
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:13491:34"/>
not the <hi>Death</hi> and the <hi>Resurrection of Christ.</hi> And I believe <hi>A.

               <p>Against the beginning of this Paragraph <hi>A. C.</hi> excepts. And first he sayes; <hi>'Tis true, that the Church</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                  <hi>of England grounded her Positive Articles upon Scripture:</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. C. p. 48.</note> 
                  <hi>That is, 'tis true, if themselves may be competent Iudges in their owne Cause.</hi> But this by the leave of <hi>A. C.</hi> is true, without making our selves Iudges in our owne Cause. For <hi>that all the Positive Articles of the present Church of England are grounded upon Scripture,</hi> we are content to be judged by the joynt and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Beliefe of the <hi>Fathers,</hi> which lived within the <hi>first foure or five hundred yeares after Christ,</hi> when the Church was at the best; and by the <hi>Councels</hi> held within those times; and to submit to them in all those Points of Doctrine. Therefore we desire not to be Iudges in our owne Cause. And if any whom <hi>A. C.</hi> cals a <hi>Novellist,</hi> can truly say, and maintaine this, he will quickly proove himselfe no <hi>Novellist.</hi> And for the <hi>Negative Articles,</hi> they refute, where the thing affirmed by you, is either not affirmed in Scripture, or not directly to be concluded out of it: Vpon this <hi>Negative</hi> ground <hi>A. C.</hi> inferres againe, <hi>That the Baptisme of Infants is not expresly (at least not evidently) affirmed in Scripture, nor directly (at least not</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. C. p. 49.</note>

                  <hi>demonstratively) concluded out of it.</hi> In which case he <hi>professes, he would gladly know, what can be answered to defend this doctrine, to be a Point of Faith necessary for the salvation of Infants.</hi> And in Conclusion, <hi>professes he cannot easily guesse what Answer can be made, unlesse we will acknowledge, Authority of Church-Tradition ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in this Case.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And truly since <hi>A. C.</hi> is so desirous of an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I will give it freely. And first in the Generall. I am no way satisfied with <hi>A. C.</hi> his <hi>Addition (not expresly, at least not evidently)</hi> what means he? If he speake of the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Scripture, then, whatsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is <hi>expresly,</hi> is <hi>evidently</hi> in the Scripture; and so his <hi>Addition</hi> is vaine. If he speake of the <hi>Meaning</hi> of the Scripture, then his <hi>Addition</hi> is cunning. For many things are <hi>Expresly</hi> in Scripture, which yet in their <hi>Meaning</hi> are not <hi>evidently</hi> there. And what e're hee meane, my words are, <hi>That our Negative Articles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute that which is not affirmed in Scripture,</hi> without any <hi>Addition</hi> of <hi>Expresly,</hi> or <hi>Evidently.</hi> And he should have taken my words, as I used them. I like nor <hi>change,</hi> nor <hi>Addition,</hi> nor am I bound to either of <hi>A. C<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.</hi> making. And I am as little satisfied with his next <hi>Addition (nor directly, at least not demonstratively concluded out of it.)</hi> For are there not many things in <hi>Good Logicke</hi> concluded, <hi>directly,</hi> which yet are not concluded <hi>Demonstratively?</hi> Surely there are. For to be directly or indirectly concluded flowes from the <hi>Moode</hi> or <hi>Forme of the Syllogisme:</hi> To be demonstra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively concluded flowes from the <hi>Matter</hi> or <hi>Nature of the Propositions.</hi> If the Propositions be Prime and necessary Truths, the <hi>Syllogisme</hi> is <hi>demonstrative</hi> and <hi>scientificall,</hi> because the <hi>Propositions</hi> are such. If the <hi>Propositions</hi> be probable onely, though the <hi>Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme</hi> be made in the clearest Moode, yet is the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:13491:40"/>
                  <hi>Conclusion</hi> no more. The Inference, or Consequence indeed is cleare and necessary, but the Consequent is but probable, or topicall, as the Propositions were. Now my words were onely for a <hi>Direct Conclusion,</hi> and no more: though in this case I might give <hi>A. C.</hi> his Caution. For <hi>Scripture</hi> here is the thing spoken of.

So, there may be an <hi>unwritten Word of God,</hi> which is no <hi>Tradition.</hi> And there are many Traditions, which are no <hi>unwritten Word of God.</hi> Therfore <hi>Tradition</hi> must be taken two wayes. Either, as it is the <hi>Churches Act</hi> delivering, or the Thing thereby delivered, and then 'tis <hi>Humane Authority,</hi> or from it, and unable <hi>infallibly</hi> to warrant <hi>Divine Faith,</hi> or to be the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of it.

He tels us, <hi>We must know infallibly, that the Bookes of Holy Scripture are Divine, and that this must be done by unwritten Tradition, but so, as that this Tradition is the Word of God unwritten:</hi> Now let him but prove that this, or any <hi>Tradition,</hi> which the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> stands upon, is the <hi>Word of God,</hi> though <hi>unwritten,</hi> and the businesse is ended. But <hi>A. C.</hi> must not thinke, that because the <hi>Tradition of the Church</hi> tels me these Bookes are <hi>Verbum Dei, Gods</hi>

The Difficulties which are pretended against <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> this, are not many, and they will easily vanish. For first, you pretend, we go to <hi>Private Revelations for Light to know Scripture.</hi> No, we do not, you see it is excluded out of the very state of the Question: and we go to the <hi>Tradition of the present Church,</hi> and by it, as well as you. Here we differ; we use the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the present Church, as the <hi>first Motive,</hi> not as the <hi>Last Resolution</hi> of our Faith. We <hi>Resolve</hi> onely into <note n="d" place="margin">

               <p>Secondly, you pretend, we do not, nor cannot <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="23"/> know the <hi>prime Apostolicall Tradition,</hi> but by the <hi>Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the present Church;</hi> and that therefore, if the Tradition of the present Church be not Gods <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>written Word, and Divine,</hi> we cannot yet know Scripture to be Scripture, by <hi>a Divine Authority.</hi> Well: Suppose I could not know the <hi>prime Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to be Divine, but by the <hi>present Church,</hi> yet it doth not follow, that therefore I cannot know Scripture to be the Word of God by <hi>a Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> because <hi>Divine Tradition</hi> is not the sole, and one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meanes to prove it. For suppose, I had not, nor could have full assurance of <hi>Apostolicall Tradition Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine;</hi> yet the morall perswasion, reason, and force of the present Church, is ground enough to move any reasonable man, that it is fit he should read the Scripture, and esteeme very reverently and highly of it. And this once done, the <hi>Scripture</hi> hath then <hi>In,</hi> and <hi>Home-Arguments</hi> enough to put a Soule, that hath but ordinary Grace, out of Doubt, <hi>That Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the Word of God, Infallible and Divine.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, you pretend, that we make the Scripture <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="24"/> absolutely, and fully to be knowne <hi>Lumine suo,</hi> by
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:13491:56"/>
the Light and Testimony which it hath <hi>in,</hi> and gives to it selfe. Against this, you give reason for your selves, and proofe from us. Your Reason is, <hi>If there be sufficient Light in Scripture to shew it selfe, then every man that can, and doth but read it, may know it presently to be the Divine Word of God; which we see by daily experience, men neither do, nor can.</hi> First it is not absolutely, nor universally true, There is <note n="a" place="margin">And where <hi>Hooker</hi> uses this very Argument, as he doth, L. 3. §. 8. his words are not, If there bee <hi>sufficient</hi> Light. <hi>But, if that Light bee</hi> Evident.</note> 
                  <hi>sufficient Light;</hi> therefore every man may see it. Blinde men are men, and cannot see it; and <note n="b" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 14.</note> 
                  <hi>sensuall men,</hi> in the Apostles judgement, are such: Nor may we deny, and put out this Light, as <hi>insufficient,</hi> because <hi>blinde eyes</hi> cannot, and <hi>perverse eyes</hi> will not see it; no more then we may deny meat to be sufficient for nourishment, though men that are heart-sicke, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eat it. Next, we do not say, That there is <hi>such a full light in Scripture,</hi> as that every man upon the first sight must yeeld to it; such Light as is found in Prime Principles; <hi>Every whole is greater than a Part of the same,</hi> and this, <hi>The same thing cannot be, and not be, at the same time, and in the same respect.</hi> These carrie a naturall Light with them, and evident: for the <hi>Termes</hi> are no sooner understood, then the <hi>Principles themselves</hi> are fully knowne, to the <hi>convincing</hi> of mans understanding, and so they are the beginning of <hi>knowledge;</hi> which, where it is perfect, dwels in <hi>full Light:</hi> but such a full Light we do neither say is, nor require to be in Scripture; and if any particular man doe, let him answer for himselfe. The Question is, onely <hi>of such a Light in Scripture,</hi> as is of force to <hi>breed faith,</hi> that it is the Word of God; not to make <hi>a perfect knowledge.</hi> Now <hi>Faith,</hi> of whatsoever it is, this or other Principle, is an <hi>Evidence,</hi>

                  <hi>Hooker gives a very sensible Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration: It is not the Word of God, which doth, or possibly can assure us, that wee doe well to thinke it is His Word: for if any one Booke of Scripture did give Testimony to all; yet still that Scripture, which giveth credit to the rest, would require another to give credit unto it. Nor could we ever come to any pause, to rest our assurance this way. so that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse, beside Scripture, there were something that might assure, &amp;c.</hi> And <note n="d" place="margin">L. 2. §. 7. &amp;.

                  <hi>this he acknowledgeth</hi> (saith <hi>Brierly) is the Authority of Gods Church.</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely, <hi>Hooker</hi> gives a true, and a sensible De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstration; but <hi>Brierly</hi> wants <hi>fidelity,</hi> and <hi>inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity,</hi> in citing him: For in the first place, <hi>Hoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker's</hi> speech is, <hi>Scripture it selfe cannot teach this;</hi> nor can the Truth say, that Scripture it selfe can. It must needs <hi>ordinarily</hi> have <hi>Tradition,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the minde of a man to receive it. And in the next place, where he speaks so sensibly, That <hi>Scripture</hi> cannot beare witnesse to it selfe, nor one part of it to another; that is grounded upon <hi>Nature,</hi> which admits no created thing to bee witnesse to it selfe; and is acknowledged by our Saviour, <note n="e" place="margin">S. Ioh. 5. 31. He speakes <hi>of himselfe</hi> as man.</note> 
                  <hi>If I beare witnesse to my selfe, my witnesse is not true,</hi> that is, <hi>is not of force to bee reasonably accepted for Truth.</hi> But then it is more then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, <note place="margin">S. Ioh. 8. 13.</note> that <hi>Hooker</hi> delivers his Demonstration of <hi>Scripture alone.</hi> For if Scripture hath another proofe, nay many other proofes to usher it, and lead it in, then no question, it can both prove; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove it selfe. His words are, <hi>So that unlesse, besides
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:13491:57"/>
Scripture, there be,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Besides Scripture;</hi> therefore he excludes not Scripture, though he call for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proofe to lead it in, and help in assurance, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Tradition,</hi> which no man, that hath his braines about him, denies. In the two other Places <hi>Brierly</hi> falsifies shamefully; for folding up all that <hi>Hooker</hi> sayes, in these words, <hi>This</hi> (other meanes to assure us besides Scripture) <hi>is the Authority of Gods Church;</hi> he wrinkles that <hi>Worthy Authour</hi> desperately, and shrinkes up his meaning. For in the former place abused by <hi>Brierly,</hi> no man can set a better state of the Question betweene <hi>Scripture,</hi> and <hi>Tradition,</hi> then <hi>Hooker</hi> doth: <note n="a" place="margin">L. 2. §. 7.</note> His words are these, <hi>The Scripture is the ground of our Beliefe; The Authority of man</hi> (that is the Name he gives to <hi>Tradition) is the Key which opens the doore of entrance into the knowledge of the Scripture.</hi> I aske now, when a man is entred, and hath viewed a house, and upon viewing likes it, and upon liking resolves unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to dwell there; doth he set up his Resolution upon the <hi>Key,</hi> that let him in? No sure; but upon the <hi>goodnesse</hi> and <hi>Commodiousnesse,</hi> which he sees <hi>in the House.</hi> And this is all the difference (that I know) betweene us in this Point; In which, do you grant (as you ought to do) that we resolve our Faith into <hi>Scripture,</hi> as the <hi>Ground;</hi> and we will never deny, that <hi>Tradition</hi> is the <hi>Key</hi> that lets us in. In the latter place, <hi>Hooker</hi> is as plaine, as constant to himselfe, and Truth: <note n="b" place="margin">L. 3. §. 8.</note> His words are, <hi>The first out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Motive, leading men so to esteeme of the Scripture, is the Authority of Gods Church</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But afterwards, the more wee bestow our Labour in reading, or learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Mysteries thereof, the more wee finde that the thing it selfe doth answer our received opinion concerning it: so that the former inducement prevailing</hi>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:13491:58"/>
                  <hi>somewhat with us before, doth now much more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, when the very thing hath ministred farther Reason.</hi> Here then againe, in his Iudgement, <hi>Tradition</hi> is the <hi>first Inducement;</hi> but the <hi>farther Reason,</hi> and <hi>Ground,</hi> is the Scripture. And <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution of Faith</hi> ever settles upon the <hi>Farthest Reason</hi> it can, not upon the <hi>First Inducement.</hi> So that the State of this Question is firme, and yet plaine enough, to him that will not shut his eyes.</p>
               <p>Now here after a long silence <hi>A. C.</hi> thrusts <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="26"/> himselfe in againe, and tels me, <hi>That if I would</hi>

                  <hi>consider the Tradition of the Church, not onely as it is the Tradition of a Company of Fallible men, in which sense the Authority of it</hi> (as himselfe confesses) <hi>is but Humane, and Fallible,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But as the Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a Company of men assisted by Christ, and his Holy Spirit; in that sense I might easily finde it more then an Introduction, indeed as much as would amount to an Infallible Motive.</hi> Well, I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered <hi>The Tradition of the present Church</hi> both these wayes. And I finde that <hi>A. C.</hi> confesses, That in the first sense, the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Church is <hi>meere humane Authority,</hi> and no more. And therefore in <hi>this sense,</hi> it may serve for an <hi>Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction</hi> to this Beliefe, but no more. And in the <hi>second sense,</hi> as it is not the <hi>Tradition</hi> of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men onely, but <hi>of men assisted by Christ, and His Spirit:</hi> In this <hi>second sense</hi> I cannot finde, that the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>present</hi> Church is of <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Infallible Authority,</hi> till <hi>A. C.</hi> can prove, That this Company of men (the <hi>Romane Prelates,</hi> and <hi>their Clergie</hi> he meanes) are so <hi>fully,</hi> so <hi>cleerely,</hi> so <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manently</hi> assisted by <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Spirit,</hi> as may reach to Infallibility, much lesse to a <hi>Divine Infallibility,</hi>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:13491:58"/>
in this, or any other Principle, which they teach. For every <hi>Assistance of Christ, and the Blessed Spirit,</hi> is not enough to make the Authority of any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men <hi>Divine,</hi> and <hi>infallible;</hi> but such and so great an <hi>Assistance</hi> onely, as is purposely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to that effect. Such an <hi>Assistance</hi> the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> under the Old Testament, and the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles</hi> under the New had; but neither the <hi>High-Priest</hi> with his Clergie in the Old, nor any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Prelates,</hi> or <hi>Priests</hi> in the New, since the <hi>Apostles</hi> ever had it. And therefore, <hi>though at the entreaty of A. C. I have considered</hi> this very <note place="margin">A. C. p. 52.</note> well; yet I cannot, no not in this <hi>Assisted sense,</hi> thinke the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the present Church, <hi>Divine,</hi> and <hi>Infallible,</hi> or <hi>such Company of men to be worthy of Divine, and infallible Credit, and sufficient to breed in us Divine, and Infallible Faith.</hi> Which I am sorrie <hi>A.

                  <hi>That Company of men (the Romane Bishop, and his Clergie) of Divine and Infallible Credit, and suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to breed in us Divine, and Infallible Faith?</hi> Good God!

                  <hi>it is as easie to take the Tradition of the present Church in the two fore-named senses, as the present Scriptures printed, and approved by men of this Age. For in the first sense, The very Scriptures</hi> (saith he) <hi>considered as prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and approved by men of this Age, can be no more then of Humane Credit. But in the second sense, as printed and approved by men assisted by God's Spirit for true Copies of that which was first written, then we may give Infallible Credit to them.</hi> Well. I have considered this too. And I can take the Printing, and Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Copies of <hi>Holy-Writ</hi> in these <hi>two senses.</hi> And I can, and do make a difference betweene Copies printed and approved by meere <hi>morall men,</hi> and <hi>men assisted by Gods Spirit.</hi> And yet for the Printing one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, a <hi>skilfull,</hi> and an able <hi>morall man</hi> may doe better service to the Church, then an <hi>illiterate</hi> man, though assisted in other things by <hi>God's</hi> Spirit.

And (as I conceive) this is that hee would have. <hi>The Tradition of the present Church is as able to worke in us Divine and Infallible Faith, That the Scripture is the VVord of God: As that the Bible (or Bookes of Scripture) now printed, and in use, is a true Copie of that, which was first writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, by the Penne-men of the Holy Ghost, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered

                  <hi>As for the Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of after Ages, in, and about which Miracles and Divine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er were not so evident, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them</hi> (by Gandavo's full Confession) <hi>because they doe not preach other things then those for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer (the Apostles) left in</hi> scriptis certissimis, <hi>in most certaine Scripture.

               <p>And now by this time it will be no hard thing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="33"/> to reconcile the <hi>Fathers,</hi> which seeme to speake dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently in no few places, both one from another, and the same from themselves, touching <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Tradition;</hi> And that as well in this Point, to prove <hi>Scripture</hi> to be the Word of God, as for <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant exposition</hi> of <hi>Scripture</hi> in all things else.

               <p>To gather up whatsoever may seeme scattered <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="34"/> in this long Discourse to prove, <hi>That Scripture is the Word of God,</hi> I shall now in the Last Place put all together, that so the whole state of the <hi>Question</hi> may the better appeare.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First</hi> then I shall desire the <hi>Reader</hi> to consider, <note place="margin">Pun. 1.</note> that every <hi>Rationall Science</hi> requires some <hi>Principles</hi> quite without its owne Limits, which are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in that Science, but presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed. Thus <hi>Rhetoricke</hi> presuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses <hi>Grammar,</hi> and <hi>Musicke Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meticke.</hi> Therefore it is most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable that <note n="c" place="margin">
                     <hi>Omnis Scientia praesupponit fidem ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam. S.</hi> Prosper. <hi>in Psalm</hi> 123. And <hi>S.</hi> Cynl. <hi>Hierosol. Catechesi</hi> 5. shewes how all things in the world do <hi>side con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistere.</hi> Therefore most unreasonable to deny that to Divinity, which all Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, nay all things challenge. Namely, somethings to be presupposed, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved.</note> 
                  <hi>Theologie</hi> should be allowed to have some <hi>Principles</hi> also, which she proves not, but presupposes. And the chiefest of these, is, <hi>That the Scriptures are of Divine Authority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> that there is a great deale of difference <note place="margin">Pun. 2.</note> in the <hi>Manner of confirming</hi> the <hi>Principles</hi> of <hi>Divinity,</hi> and those of any other <hi>Art,</hi> or <hi>Science</hi> whatsoever.</p>
               <p>

For the <hi>Principles</hi> of all other <hi>Sciences</hi> doe <hi>finally resolve,</hi> either into the <hi>Conclusions</hi> of some <hi>Higher Science;</hi> or into those <hi>Principles</hi> which are <hi>per se no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> known by their own light, and are the Grounds and <hi>Principles</hi> of all Science. And this is it, which properly makes them <hi>Sciences,</hi> because they proceed with such strength of <hi>Demonstration,</hi> as forces <hi>Reason</hi> to yeeld unto them. But the <hi>Principles of Divinity</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve not into the Grounds of <hi>Naturall Reason</hi> (For then there would be no roome for <hi>Faith,</hi> but all would bee either <hi>Knowledge,</hi> or <hi>Vision)</hi> but into the <hi>Maximes of Divine Knowledge supernaturall.</hi> And of this we have just so much light, and no more, then God hath revealed unto us in the <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That though the <hi>Evidence</hi> of these <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaturall</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pun. 3.</note>

                     <hi>Si vis credere manifestis, invisibilibus magis quàm visibilibus oportet credere. Licet dictum sit admirabile, verum est, &amp;c.

               <p>I will not now enter againe into that Discourse, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> having said enough already, how farre the <hi>Beame,</hi> which is very glorious (especially in some parts of Scripture) gives <hi>light</hi> to prove it selfe.

then indeed we settle for our <hi>Direction,</hi> but not upon the first opening of the <hi>morning Light,</hi> but upon the <hi>Sun</hi> it selfe.

Nor whether a <hi>Praecognitum,</hi> a presupposed Principle in Faith, which rests upon <hi>Divine Authority,</hi> must needs have as much, and equall <hi>Light</hi> to Naturall Reason, as Prime Principles have in Nature, while they rest upon Reason.

               <p>Well, though I do none of this, yet first I must <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> tell you, that <hi>A.

<pb n="120" facs="tcp:13491:73"/>
in Science, or in Faith, the</hi> Praecognitum, <hi>or thing sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed as knowne, must be</hi> priùs cognitum, <hi>first knowne, and not need another thing pertaining to that Faith, or Knowledge, to be knowne before it. But the Scripture</hi> (saith he) <hi>needs Tradition to goe before it, and introduce the knowledge of it. Therefore the Scripture is not to be supposed, as a</hi> Praecognitum, <hi>and a thing fore-knowne.</hi> Tru'y I am sorrie to see in a man very learned such wilfull mistakes. For <hi>A.

                  <hi>before,</hi> That I intended not to speake precisely of a <hi>Praecog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitum</hi> in this Argument. But when I said, <hi>Scriptures were Principles to be supposed;</hi> I did not, I could not intend, They were <hi>priùs cognitae,</hi> knowne before <hi>Tradition;</hi> since I confesse every where, That <hi>Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> introduces the knowledge of them. But my meaning is plaine; <hi>That the Scriptures are and must be Principles supposed,</hi> before you can dispute this Question; <note n="†" place="margin">And my immediate Words in the Conference, upon which the <hi>Iesuite</hi> ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>How I knew Scripture to be Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi> were (as the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

tract and corruption of times, very deepely. A Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision was made; yet so, that both <hi>Parts</hi> held the <hi>Creed,</hi> and other Common Principles of Beliefe.

                  <hi>That the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the VVord of God;</hi> For our beliefe of all things contained in it, depends upon it. Since this Divisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there hath beene nothing done by us to discre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit this <hi>Principle.</hi> Nay, We have given it all honour, and ascribed unto it more sufficiency, <hi>even to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of all things necessary to salvation,</hi> with <note n="*" place="margin">

For <hi>Tradition</hi> is but a <hi>Lane</hi> in the Church; it hath an end, not only to receive us in, but another after, to let us out, into more open, and richer ground. <hi>And We go a better way then you:</hi> Because after we are mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and prepared, and induced by <hi>Tradition,</hi> we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve our Faith into that Written Word, and God delivering it; in which we finde <hi>materially,</hi> though not in <hi>Termes,</hi> the very <hi>Tradition,</hi> that led us thither. And so we are sure by Divine Authority that we are in the way, because at the end we find the way prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

Should we have suffered this <hi>Gangren</hi> to endanger life and all, rather then bee cured in time by a <hi>Physitian</hi> of a weaker knowledge, and a lesse able Hand? Secondly, We live to see since, if we had stayed and expected a <hi>Generall Councell,</hi> what manner of one we should have had, if any. For that at <hi>Trent</hi> was neither <hi>generall,</hi> nor <hi>free.</hi> And for the <hi>Errours</hi> which <hi>Rome</hi> had contracted, it <hi>confirmed</hi> them, it <hi>cured</hi> them not.

It is most true: No man in common equity ought to be suffered to be <hi>Accuser, Witnesse,</hi> and <hi>Iudge in his owne Cause.</hi> But is there not as little reason, and equity too, that any man that is to be accused, should be the <hi>Accused,</hi> and yet <hi>VVitnesse,</hi> and <hi>Iudge</hi> in his owne Cause? If the first may hold, no man shall be <hi>Innocent;</hi> and if the last, none will be <hi>Nocent.</hi> And what doe we here with <hi>(in their owne Cause against the Romane Church?)</hi> Why? Is it not your owne too, against the <hi>Protestant Church?</hi> And if it be a <hi>Cause</hi> common to both, as certaine it is, then nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Part</hi> alone may be Iudge: If neither alone may judge, then either they must be judged by a <note n="*" place="margin">§. 21.

C.</hi> dares not say 'tis unlawfull for a particular Church or man to <hi>Condemne</hi> another. And farther, whatsoever <hi>A. C.</hi> can say to the contrary, there are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse Cases, where <hi>Heresies</hi> are knowne, and notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in which it will be hard to say (as he doth) That <note place="margin">A.

another, so farre forth at least, as to abhorre and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test against the <hi>Heresie</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If one Particular Church may not Iudge <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> or Condemne another, what must then be done, where Particulars need Reformation? What? Why then <hi>A. C.</hi> tels us, <hi>That Particular Churches must in</hi>

                     <hi>And after hee saith, p. 58.</hi> that the Bishop of Rome is, and ought to bee the Iudge of parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Churches in this Case.</note> 
                  <hi>her Bishop, who is chiefe Pastour of the whole Church, as being S. Peter's Successour, to whom Christ promised the keyes, S. Matth. 16. for whom he prayed that his Faith might not faile, S. Luke 22. And whom he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to seed and governe the whole Flocke, S: Iohn 21. And this (A. C.</hi> tels us) <hi>he shall never refuse to doe in such sort, as that this neglect shall be a Iust Cause for any Particular Man, or Church, under Pretence of Reformation in Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or Faith, to make a Schisme or Separation from the Whole Generall Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well; first you see where <hi>A. C.</hi> would have us. If <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> 
                  <hi>any Particular Churches differ in Points of Divine Truth, they must not Iudge, or Condemne each other,</hi> (saith he) No, take heed of that in any case; That's the <hi>Office</hi> of the <hi>Universall Church.</hi> And yet he will have it, <hi>That Rome, which is but a Particular Church, must and ought Iudge all other Particulars.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, he tels us this is so; <hi>Because the Church of Rome hath more Powerfull Principality, then other</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> 
                  <hi>Particular Churches, and that her Bishop is Pastour of the Whole Church.</hi> To this I answer, that it is most true indeed; the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath had, and hath yet, <hi>more Powerfull Principality,</hi> then any other Particular Church. But she hath not this Power from <hi>Christ.</hi> The <hi>Romane Patriarch,</hi> by <hi>Ecclesiasticall Constitutions,</hi> might perhaps have a <hi>Primacy of Order;</hi> But for <hi>Principality of Power,</hi> the <hi>Patriarchs</hi> were as <hi>even,</hi> as

No, nothing lesse.

And (as they understand <hi>Irenae)</hi> a Necessity lay upon all other Churches to agree with this: but this Necessity was laid upon them by the <hi>Then Integrity of the Christian Faith there professed, not by the Universality of the Romane Jurisdiction now challenged.</hi> And let <hi>Rome</hi> reduce it selfe to the <hi>Observation of Tradition Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolike,</hi> to which it then held, and I will, say as <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus</hi> did; <hi>That it will be then necessary for every Church, and for the Faithfull every where, to agree with it.</hi> Lastly, let me Observe too, That <hi>Irenaeus</hi> made no doubt, but that <hi>Rome</hi> might fall away from <hi>Apostolicall Tradition,</hi> as well as other <hi>Particular Churches</hi> of great <hi>Name</hi> have done. For he does not say, <hi>in quâ servanda semper erit, sed in quâ servata est:</hi> Not, in which Church the Doctrine delivered from the Apostles shal ever be entirely kept: That had beene <hi>home</hi> indeed:

But in which, by God's grace and mercy, it was to that time of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> so kept and preserved.

First, because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Learned men have challenged many Popes for teaching Heresy; and that's against the true Faith.

                  <hi>he doth.</hi> Secondly, because Christ obtained of his Father every thing that he prayed for, if he prayed for it absolutely, and not under a Condition: <hi>Father I know thou hearest me alwayes</hi> S. <hi>Iohn 11.</hi> Now Christ here pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed absolutely for S. <hi>Peter;</hi> Therefore whatsoever he <note place="margin">S.

                  <hi>Gregory the seventh</hi> had set the <hi>Popedome</hi> upon a broad bottome before this <hi>Innocents</hi> time.

meere fancy. But the true reason indeed, why <hi>Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> made it, was that above mentioned. He was now in that greatnesse, that he thought he might passe any thing upon the <hi>Christian world,</hi> that pleased him: And was therefore resolved to bring it into the <hi>Body of the Canon,</hi> that after times might have a <hi>Law</hi> to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitimate and make good their <hi>Predecessors usurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> over <hi>Emperors</hi> and <hi>Kings.</hi> And rather then faile of this, ho would not spare the abusing of <hi>Scripture</hi> it selfe.

Secondly, that supposing he both can and will so do, yet the <hi>Iesuites</hi> cannot be certaine, that that one Vniforme Exercise of Religion shall be the <hi>Romane Catholike.</hi> And Thirdly, That as there is a <hi>Body of Earth,</hi> a world of Confusion, to Eclipse their <hi>Moon</hi> the <hi>Emperor:</hi> so in the same way, and by like interpositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the <hi>Moone</hi> when 'tis growne too neare in conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, may Eclipse their <hi>Sunne the Pope</hi> And there is no great doubt but he will, considering what some <hi>great Kings</hi> make of the <hi>Popes</hi> power at this day, when it pleases them.</p>

                  <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Testimony from it, nay quite</hi> extrà, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Scripture?</hi> Nay <hi>secondly,</hi> Is that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell <note n="*" place="margin">Here <hi>A. C.</hi> tells us, <hi>that doubtlesse the Arrians also did mislike, that at Nice the Pope had Legates to carry his messages, and that one of them in his place sate as Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sident.</hi> Why but first, 'tis manifest, that <hi>Hosius</hi> was presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent at the Councell of Nice, and not the <hi>Bishop of Rome,</hi> either by himselfe or his Legates. And so much <hi>Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasius</hi> himselfe, (who was present, and surely understood the Councell of Nice, and who presided there, as well as <hi>A. C.)</hi> tells us: <hi>Hosius hic est Princeps Synodorum.</hi> (So belike He presided in other Councells as well as at Nice) <hi>Hic formulam Fidei in Nicaenâ Synodo concepit.</hi> And this the Arrians themselves confesse to <hi>Constantius</hi> the Emperour, then seduced to be theirs. <hi>Apud S. Atbanas.

Tertia conditio,</hi> Namely, <hi>That 'tis unjust to deny the Roman Prelat his Right</hi> (Ius suum) <hi>in Calling Generall Councells, and Presiding in them, in possession of which Right he hath bin for 1500. yeares:</hi> That's but a bold Assertion of the <hi>Cardinalls</hi> by his leave. For he gives us no proofe of it, but his bare word. Whereas the very <hi>Authenticke</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of the Councells, published, and printed by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi> themselves, affirme cleerely, they were called by <hi>Emperors,</hi> not by the <hi>Pope;</hi> And that the <hi>Pope</hi> did not preside in all of them. And I hope <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will not expect, we should take his bare word against the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells.</hi> And most certaine it is, that even as <hi>Hosius</hi> Presided the Councell at <hi>Nice,</hi> and no way that, as the Popes Legate: so also in the second Generall Councell, which was the first of <hi>Constantinople, Nectarius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantinople</hi> Presided. <hi>Concil.

Or is it to be accounted a <hi>Generall Councell,</hi> that in many Sessions had scarce <hi>Ten Archbishops,</hi> or <hi>Forty,</hi> or <hi>Fifty Bishops</hi> present?

                  <hi>Popes Legates;</hi> And so we finde him in the <hi>fift Session</hi> of that Councell; but neither before, nor after.

I know it will be expected I <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> should prove what I say. And it is hard to prove the purpose of the <hi>Pope's</hi> Heart. For if it be proved that he made <hi>Bishops</hi> at that time; that some of them were <hi>Titular</hi> onely, and had no <hi>Livelihood</hi> to subsist, but out of his <hi>purse</hi> (and so must hang their Iudgement at the strings of it;) That some of these thus made were sent to the <hi>Councell;</hi> and sure not without their <hi>Errand:</hi> yet if the <hi>Pope</hi> will say, he neither made, nor sent them to <hi>over rule the Holy Ghost</hi> at that Meeting, or of purpose for his side (as no question but it will be said) who can prove it, that is not a <hi>Surveyor of the heart?</hi> But though the <hi>Pope's</hi> heart cannot be seene, yet if these, and the like Presumptions be true, it is a great signe that <hi>Trent</hi> was too corrupt, and factious a Meeting for the <hi>Holy Ghost</hi> to be at.

               </p>
               <p>That which I said was, That <hi>Trent</hi> could be no Indifferent Councell to the <hi>Church,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> having made himselfe a strong Party in it. And this I proved, though you be here not onely content to omit, but plainely to denie the Proofe. For I proved it thus (and you <note n="†" place="margin">

double. And this I proved out of the <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell</hi> it selfe, which you had in your hand in <hi>Decimo sexto;</hi> but had no great heart to looke it. For, where the <hi>number</hi> of <hi>Praelates</hi> is expressed, that had <hi>Suffrage</hi> and <hi>Vote</hi> in that <hi>Councell,</hi> the <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> are set downe to bee 187. and all the rest make but 83.

So I proved this sufficiently, I thinke. For if it were not to be sure of a side, give any satisfying rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, why such a potent Party of <hi>Italians,</hi> more then double to the whole Christian world, should be there? Shew me the like for <hi>Nice,</hi> and I will give it, that the Case is alike betweene these two Councels.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Bellarmine</hi> comes in to helpe: But sure it <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> will not helpe you, that he hath offered at as much against the Councell of <hi>Nice,</hi> as I have urged against that at <hi>Trent.</hi> For hee tels us, <note n="*" place="margin">In Concilio Nicano prime ex Occidente solùm fuerunt duo Presbyteri missi ex Italia, unus Episcopus ex Gallià, unus ex Hispanià, &amp; unus ex Africà, <hi>Bellar.</hi> L. 1. de Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. c. 17. <hi>S.</hi> Antepenult.</note> 
                  <hi>That in the Councell at Nice, there were as few Bishops of the West present, as were of the East at Trent,</hi>

but <hi>five</hi> in all. Be it so. Yet this will not make the Case alike between the <hi>two Councels. First,</hi> because I presse not the disparity in number onely; but with it the <hi>Pope's</hi> carriage, to be sure of a <hi>Major part.</hi> For it lay upon the <hi>Pope</hi> to make sure worke at <hi>Trent,</hi> both for himselfe, and his Church. But neither the <hi>Greeke Church</hi> in generall, nor any <hi>Patriarch of the East</hi> had any private interest to looke to, in the <hi>Councell at Nice. Secondly,</hi> because I presse not so much against the <hi>Councell of Trent,</hi> That there were so exceeding many <hi>Bishops of the West</hi> compared with those of the <hi>East</hi> (for that must needs be, when a Councell is held in the <hi>West)</hi> but that there were so many more <hi>Italians,</hi> and <hi>Bishop obnoxious to the Pope's power,</hi> then of all <hi>Germany, France, Spaine,</hi> and all other Parts of the <hi>West</hi> besides <hi>Thirdly,</hi> because both <hi>Bellarmine</hi> and <hi>A.

                  <hi>it.

But the Caution puts the Case so, as if the Determination of a Generall Councell actually erring were not</hi> ipso jure <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid, but must stand in force, and have externall Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience yeelded to it, till not onely morall Certainty, but Evidence of Scripture, or a Demonstration to the Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry make the errour appeare; And when it appeares, wee must yeeld our Obedience, till a Councell of equall Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority reverse it, which perhaps will not bee found in an whole Age. So either the Iesuite relates this speech truly, or lesse disgracefully.</hi> And <hi>A. C.</hi> thinkes, that upon better Iudgement, I Will not allow this Caution. Truly I shall not thanke the <hi>Iesuite</hi> for any his kindnesse here. And for the <hi>Caution,</hi> I must and doe acknowledge it mine, even upon <hi>advise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and that whether it make my Answer worse, or better. And I thinke farther, that the <hi>Iesuite</hi> hath no great Cause to thanke <hi>A. C.</hi> for this Defence of his Relation.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First</hi> then the <hi>Iesuite</hi> (so sayes <hi>A. C.)</hi> doth in his <hi>Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

all to one, whether I suppose that such a Councell <hi>may erre,</hi> or that it <hi>doe erre.</hi> And 'tis fitter for clearing the Difficulties into which the Church fals in such a Case to suppose (and more then a supposition it is not) a Generall Councell <note n="*" place="margin">Synodum Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralem aliquoties errâsse percepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus. <hi>Wald.</hi> L. 2. de Doctrin.

I say it again. But is there any one word of mine in the Caution, that speakes of our <hi>knowing</hi> of this Errour? Surely not one (thats <hi>A.

And doubtlesse till they know it, Obedience must be yeelded; Nay when they know it (if the Errour be not manifestly against <hi>Fundamentall verity,</hi> in which case a <hi>Generall Councell</hi> can not easily erre) I would have <hi>A C.</hi> and all wise men Consider. Whether <hi>Externall Obedience</hi> be not even <hi>then</hi> to be yeelded. For if <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versies</hi> arise in the Church some end they must have, or they'll teare all in sunder. And I am sure no <hi>wisdome</hi> can thinke that fit, Why then say a <hi>Generall Councell Erre,</hi> and an <hi>Erring Decree</hi> be <hi>ipso jure;</hi> by the very Law it selfe <hi>invalid,</hi> I would have it wisely considered again, whether it be not fit to allow a <hi>Generall Councell</hi>

that Honour and Priviledge, which all other <hi>Great Courts</hi> have. Namely, That there be a Declaration of the Invalidity of its <hi>Decrees,</hi> as well as of the <hi>Laws</hi> of other Courts, before private men can take liberty to refuse <hi>Obedience,</hi> For till such a declaration, if the <hi>Councel</hi> stand not in force, <hi>A.

Secondly,</hi> because this <hi>Argument from the Lesse to the greater,</hi> can never fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, but where, and so farre as the thing upon which the Argument is founded, agrees to the lesse. For if it do not alwayes agree to the lesse, it cannot Necessarily passe from thence to the greater.

                  <hi>notwithstanding Christs Example.</hi> How foule <hi>Bellarmine</hi> is in this, must appeare by the Words of the Councell, which are these. <note n="*" place="margin">Licet Christus post Coenam instituerit, &amp; suis Discipulis administraverit sub utrâque specie Panis &amp; Uini hoc vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabile Sacramentum, tamen hoc <hi>Non ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stante,</hi> non debet confici post Coenam, nec recipi nifi a jejunis. <hi>(Here</hi> Bellarmine <hi>stayes, and goes no farther, but the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell goes on.)</hi> Et similitèr quòd licèt in Primitivâ Ecclesiâ Sacramenta recipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rentur sub utrâque Specie à fidelibus, tamen haec Consuetudo, ut à Laicis sub Specie Panis tantum suscipiatur, haben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da est pro Lege, quam non licet reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re, Et asserere hanc esse illicitam, est Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneum, Et pertinacitèr asserentes sunt arcendi tanquam Haretici.

                  <hi>Though Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted this venerable Sacrament, and gave it his Disciples after Supper under both kindes of Bread and Wine, yet,</hi> Non obstante, <hi>notwithstanding this, it ought not to be Consecrated after Supper; nor received but fasting. And likewise, that though in the Primitive Church this Sacrament was received by the faithfull under both kindes; yet this Custome, that it should be received by Lay-men only under the kinde of Bread, is to be held for a Law, which may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused. And to say, this is an unlawfull Custome of Receiving under one kinde, is erroneous; and they which persist in saying so, are to be punished, and driven out as Heretiks.</hi> Now, where is here any slander of the Councel? The words are plaine, and the <hi>Non obstante</hi> must necessarily (for ought I can yet see) be referred to both Clauses in the words following, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause both Clauses went before it, &amp; hath as much force against Receiving under both kindes, as against receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after Supper. Yea, and the after-words of the Councell couple both together, in this Reference; for it followes, <hi>Et similiter, And so likewise, that though in the Primitive Church &amp;c.</hi> And a man by the Definition of this Councell, may be an Heretike, for standing to <hi>Christs Institution,</hi> in the very <hi>matter</hi> of the Sacrament: And the Churches Law for <hi>One kinde</hi> may not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, but Christs Institution under <hi>Both kindes</hi> may.

               <p>But your opinion is more <hi>Vnreasonable</hi> then this: for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> consider any <hi>Body Collective,</hi> be it more, or lesse <hi>Vniversal,</hi> whensoever it assembles it selfe, did it ever give more power to the <hi>Representing Body</hi> of it, then binding power

                  <hi>against your Conscience.</hi> I must ever wonder much, how that can be true, since you hold this of the <hi>Pope's Infallibility,</hi> especially as being <hi>Propheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call in the Conclusion.</hi> If this be true, why doe you not lay all your strength together, all of your whole <hi>Society,</hi> and make this one <hi>Proposition</hi> evident? For all Controversies about matters of Faith are ended, and without any great trouble to the <hi>Christian World,</hi> if you can but make this one <hi>Proposition</hi> good, <hi>That the Pope is an Infallible Iudge.</hi> Till then, this shame will follow you infallibly, and eternally, That you should make the <hi>Pope,</hi> a meere man, <hi>Principium Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei,</hi> a Principle, or Authour of Faith; and make the mouth of him, whom you call <hi>Christ's Vicar,</hi> sole Iudge, both of <hi>Christ's Word,</hi> be it never so manifest,

and of his <hi>Church,</hi> be she never so Learned, and carefull of his Truth. And for Conclusion of this Point, I would faine know (since this had beene so plaine, so easie a way, either to <hi>prevent</hi> all Divisions about the <hi>Faith,</hi> or to <hi>end</hi> all <hi>Controversies,</hi> did they arise) why this briefe, but most necessary <hi>Proposition, The Bishop of Rome cannot erre in his Iudiciall Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations concerning the Faith,</hi> is not to be found either in <hi>Letter,</hi> or <hi>sense,</hi> in any <hi>Scripture,</hi> in any <hi>Councell;</hi> or in any <hi>Father</hi> of the Church, for the full space of a thousand yeares and more after <hi>Christ?</hi> For had this <hi>Proposition</hi> been true, and then received in the Church, how weake were all the <hi>Primitive Fathers,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe so many <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Cautions</hi> for avoydance of Heresie, as <hi>Tertullian,</hi> and <hi>Vincentius Lirinensis,</hi> and others do, and to indure such hard Conflicts, as they did, and with so many various <hi>Haereticks;</hi> To see <hi>Christendome</hi> so rent, and torne by some distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered <hi>Councels,</hi> as that of <hi>Ariminum,</hi> the <hi>second of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> and others; Nay to see the <hi>whole world almost be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Arrian, to the amazement of it selfe;</hi> And yet all this time not so much as call in this <hi>Necessary Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> and let the world know, <hi>That the Bishop of Rome was infallible;</hi> that so in his <hi>Decision</hi> all differences might cease? For either the <hi>Fathers of the Church, Greeke,</hi> as well as <hi>Latine,</hi> knew this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to be true, <hi>That the Pope cannot Erre Iudicially in matters belonging to the Faith,</hi> or they knew it not. If you say they knew it not; you charge them with a base, and unworthy <hi>Ignorance,</hi> no wayes like to over-cloud such, and so many Learned men, in a Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter so Necessary, and of such infinite use to <hi>Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> If you say they knew it, and durst not deliver this Truth, how can you charge them which durst die for Christ, with such <hi>Cowardise</hi> towards his Church?
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:13491:148"/>
And if you say they knew it and with-held it from the <hi>Church,</hi> you lay a most unjust Load upon those <hi>Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Soules,</hi> which loved Christ too well to imprison any Truth, but likely to make or keepe peace in his <hi>Church Catholike</hi> over the world.

                  <hi>He</hi> confesses, <hi>That Pope Adrian the second, with the Councell then held at Rome, and the eight Generall Synod did thinke that the Pope might be judged in the Cause of Heresie: And that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Church were most misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, if it should be constrained to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a Wolfe manifestly raging for her Shepheard.</hi> And here againe I have a Question to aske, whether you believe the <hi>eight Generall Councell,</hi> or not? If you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it, then you see the <hi>Pope</hi> can erre, and so He not <hi>Infallible.</hi> If you believe it not, then in your Iudgement <hi>that Generall Councell</hi> erres, and so that not <hi>Infallible.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is altogether in vaine and to no use, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> that the <hi>Pope</hi> should be <hi>Infallible,</hi> and that according to your owne <hi>Principles.</hi> Now <hi>God and Nature make nothing in vaine.</hi> Therefore either the <hi>Pope</hi> is not <hi>Infallible,</hi> or at least God never made him so. That the <hi>Infallibility</hi> of the <hi>Pope</hi> (had he any in him) is altogether vaine, and uselesse, is manifest. For if it be of any <hi>use,</hi> 'tis for the setling of <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Peace</hi> in the Church, in all times of her Distraction. But neither the <hi>Church,</hi> nor any <hi>member</hi> of it can make any use of the <hi>Popes Infallibility</hi>
                  <pb n="271" facs="tcp:13491:149"/>
that way; Therefore it is of no use or benefit at all. And this also is as manifest, as the rest. For before the Church, or any particular man can make any use of <hi>this Infallibility,</hi> to settle him and his Conscience, hee must either <hi>Know</hi> or <hi>Believe</hi> that the <hi>Pope</hi> is <hi>Infallible;</hi> But a man can neither <hi>Know</hi> nor <hi>Believe</hi> it. And <hi>first</hi> for <hi>Beliefe;</hi> For if the Church, or any Christian man can believe it, he must believe it either by <hi>Divine,</hi> or by <hi>Humane Faith. Divine Faith</hi> cannot be had of it; For (as is before prooved) it hath no Ground in the <hi>written Word of God.</hi> Nay (to follow you closer) it was never delivered by any <hi>Tradition</hi> of the <hi>Catholike Church.</hi> And for <hi>Humane Faith,</hi> no <hi>Rationall</hi> man can possibly believe (having no Word of God to over-rule his Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding) that he which is <hi>Fallible in the meanes,</hi> as <note n="a" place="margin">

Now <hi>secondly</hi> for <hi>Knowledge,</hi> And that is altogether impossible too, that either the Church, or any Member of the Church, should ever know that <hi>the Pope is Infallible.</hi> And this I shall make evident al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so out of your owne <hi>Principles.</hi> For your <note n="b" place="margin">Omnia Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta tribus persiciuntur &amp;c.

                  </note> This is also grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> He that is to be made <hi>Pope</hi> can never be in <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> but by receiving them from One that hath <hi>Power to Ordaine.</hi> This is notoriously knowne, So is it also, that with you <hi>Order</hi> is a <hi>Sacrament properly so called</hi> And if so, then the <hi>Pope,</hi> when he did receive the <hi>Order of Deacon,</hi> or <hi>Priesthood</hi> at the hands of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop,</hi> did also receive a <hi>Sacrament.</hi> Vpon these Grounds I raise my Argument thus. Neither the Church, nor any Member of the Church can know that this <hi>Pope</hi> which now sits, or any other that hath beene, or shall be, is <hi>Infallible.</hi> For he is not <hi>Infallible,</hi> unlesse he be <hi>Pope,</hi> and he is not <hi>Pope,</hi> unlesse he be in <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> And he cannot be so, unlesse he have received those <hi>Holy Orders,</hi> and that from one that had Power to Ordaine, And those <hi>Holy Orders</hi> in your Doctrine are a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> And a <hi>Sacrament</hi> is not perfectly given, if he that Administers it have not <hi>intentionem faciendi quod facit Ecclesia,</hi> an intention to doe that which the Church doth by <hi>Sacraments.</hi> Now who can possibly tell, that the <hi>Bishop</hi> which gave the <hi>Pope</hi> Orders, was <hi>first,</hi> a man <hi>qualified</hi> to give them: and <hi>secondly,</hi> so devoutly set upon his Worke, that he had, at the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant of giving them, an Intention and purpose to doe therein as the Church doth? Surely none but that <hi>Bishop</hi> himselfe And his testimony of himselfe, and his owne Act, such especially as, if faulty, he would be loth to Confesse, can neither give <hi>Knowledge</hi> nor <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe</hi> sufficient, that the <hi>Pope,</hi> according to this <hi>Canon,</hi> is in <hi>Holy Orders.</hi> So upon the Whole matter, let the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists</hi> take which they will (I give them free choyce)
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:13491:150"/>
either this <hi>Canon of the Councell of Trent</hi> is false Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and there is no such <hi>Intention</hi> necessary to the <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> of a <hi>Sacrament:</hi> Or if it be true, it is impossible for any man to know, and for any advis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed man to Believe, <hi>That the Pope is Infallible in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>Petilian</hi> the <hi>Donatist</hi> brag'd in the case of <hi>Baptisme.</hi> But in truth, 'tis nothing. For the Syllogisme, which it frames, is this. <hi>The Papists and the Protestants, which are the Parties differing, agree in this, That there is Salvation possible to be found in the Romane Church. But in Point of Faith and Salvation 'tis safest for a man to take that way, which the differing Parties agree on. Therfore 'tis safest for a man to be, and continue in the Romane Church.</hi> To the <hi>Major Proposition</hi> then; I observe <hi>first,</hi> that though <hi>ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> Learned <hi>Protestants</hi> grant this, <hi>all</hi> doe not. And then that Proposition is not <hi>Universall,</hi> nor able to sustaine the <hi>Conclusion.</hi> For they doe not in this all agree; nay I doubt not, but there are some <hi>Protestants,</hi> which can, and do as stifly, and as churlishly deny them <hi>Salvation,</hi> as they doe us. And <hi>A. C.</hi> should doe well to consider, whether they doe it not upon as good reason at least. Next for the <hi>Minor Proposition;</hi> Namely, <hi>That in point of Faith and Salvation, 'tis safest for a man to take that way, which the Adversary confesses, or the Differing Parties agree on.</hi> I fay, that is no <hi>Metaphysicall Principle,</hi> but a bare <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent Proposition,</hi> and may be <hi>true,</hi> or <hi>false,</hi> as the matter is to which it is applyed, and so of no <hi>necessary truth</hi> in it selfe, nor able to leade in the <hi>Conclusion.</hi> Now that this Proposition <hi>(In point of Faith and Salvation, 'tis safest for a man, to take that way, which the differing Parties agree on, or which the Adversary Confesses)</hi> hath no strength in it selfe, but is sometimes <hi>true,</hi> and sometimes <hi>false,</hi> as the <hi>Matter</hi> is, about which it is conversant, is most evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. <hi>First,</hi> by Reason: Because Consent of disagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Parties, is neither <hi>Rule,</hi> nor <hi>Proofe</hi> of <hi>Truth.</hi> For <hi>Herod</hi> and <hi>Pilate,</hi> disagreeing Parties enough, yet agreed against <hi>Truth it selfe.</hi> But <hi>Truth</hi> rather is, or should be the <hi>Rule</hi> to frame, if not to force Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And <hi>secondly,</hi> by the two <hi>Instances</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">§. 35. N. 3</note> 
                  <hi>before</hi> given. For in the Instance betweene the <hi>Orthodox Church</hi> then,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:13491:158"/>
and the <hi>Donatists,</hi> this <hi>Proposition</hi> is most false; For it was a Point of <hi>Faith,</hi> and so of <hi>Salvation,</hi> that they were upon, Namely, the right use, and administration of the Sacrament of <hi>Baptisme.</hi> And yet had it beene safest to take up that way, which the differing Parts agreed on, or which the adverse Part Confessed, men must needs have gone with the <hi>Donatists</hi> against the <hi>Church.</hi> And this must fall out as oft as any, <hi>Heretick</hi> will cunningly take that way against the <hi>Church,</hi> which the <hi>Donatists</hi> did, if this <hi>Principle</hi> shall goe for currant. But in the <hi>second</hi> Instance, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> a matter of <hi>Faith,</hi> and so of <hi>Salvation</hi> too, the same <hi>Proposition</hi> is most true. And the <hi>Reason</hi> is, because <hi>here</hi> the <hi>matter</hi> is true; Namely, <hi>The true, and reall participation of the Body and Blood of Christ in that Blessed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> But in the <hi>former</hi> the <hi>matter</hi> was false, Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, That <hi>Rebaptization</hi> was necessary after <hi>Baptisme</hi> formally given by the <hi>Church.</hi> So this Propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>(In Point of Faith and Salvation it is safest for a man to take that way, which the differing Parties agree in; or which the Adversary Confesses)</hi> is, you see, both <hi>true</hi> and <hi>false,</hi> as men have cunning to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it, and as the matter is, about which it is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant. And is therefore no <hi>Proposition</hi> able, or fit to settle a <hi>Conclusion</hi> in any sober mans minde, till the <hi>Matter</hi> contained under it, bee well scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and examined. And yet as much use as you would make of this Proposition to amaze the weake, your selves dare not stand to it, no not where the matter is undenyably true, as shall appeare in divers Particulars beside this of the <hi>Eucharist.</hi>
               </p>

I must tell you what <hi>A. C.</hi> sayes to the two <note place="margin">A. C. p. 65.</note> former. For he tels us, <hi>These two are nothing like the present case.</hi> Nothing? That is strange indeed. Why in the first of those Cases concerning the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natists,</hi> your Proposition is false; And so farre from being <hi>safest,</hi> that it was no <hi>way safe</hi> for a man to take that way of <hi>Beliefe,</hi> and so of <hi>Salvation,</hi> which both parts agreed on. And is this nothing? Nay, is not this full, and home to the present case? For the present case is this, and no more. <hi>That it is safest taking that way of Beliefe, which the differing Parties agree on: or which the Adversary Confesses.</hi> And in the second of those Cases concerning the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> your Proposition indeed is true, not by the Truth which it hath in it selfe, <hi>Metaphysically,</hi> and in <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract,</hi> but only in regard of the <hi>matter,</hi> to which it is applyed; yet there you desert your owne Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition, where it is true. And is this nothing? Nay, is not this also full, and home to the present case, since it appeares your Proposition is such as your selves dare not bide by, either when it is true, or when it is false? For in the Case of <hi>Baptisme</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred by the <hi>Donatist,</hi> the <hi>Proposition</hi> is <hi>false,</hi> and you dare not bide by it, for <hi>Truths</hi> sake. And in the case of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> the <hi>Proposition</hi> is <hi>true,</hi> and yet you dare not bide by it, for the <hi>Church of Romes</hi> sake. So that <hi>Church</hi> (with you) cannot <hi>erre,</hi> and yet will not suffer you to maintaine <hi>Truth,</hi> which not to doe is some degree of Errour, and that no small one.</p>
               <p>Well, <hi>A. C.</hi> goes on, and gives his Reasons why <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> these two Instances are nothing like the present Case. <note place="margin">A. C. p. 65.</note> 
                  <hi>For in these Cases</hi> (saith hee) <hi>there are annexed other Reasons of certainly knowne perill of damnable. Schisme
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:13491:159"/>
and Heresie, which wee should incurre by consenting to the</hi> Donatists <hi>denyall of true Baptisme among Catholikes: and to the Protestants denyall, or doubting of the true substantiall Presence of Christ in the Eucharist. But in this Case of Resolving to live and dye in the Catholike Romane Church, there is confessedly no such perill of any damnable Heresie, or Schisme, or any other sinne.</hi> Here I have many Particulars to observe upon <hi>A. C.</hi> and you shall have them, as briefly as I can set them downe.</p>
               <p>And <hi>first,</hi> I take <hi>A. C.</hi> at his word, that in <note place="margin">Punct. 1.</note> the case of the <hi>Donatist,</hi> should it bee followed, there would bee knowne perill of damnable <hi>Schisme,</hi> and <hi>Heresie,</hi> by denying true <hi>Baptisme</hi> to be in the <hi>Orthodoxe Church.</hi> For by this you may see, what a sound proposition this is <hi>(That where two Parties are dissenting, it is safest believing that in which both Parties agree, or which the Adversary confesses)</hi> for here you may see by the case of the <hi>Donatist,</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessed, it may leade a man, that will <hi>universally</hi> leane to it, into <hi>knowne</hi> and <hi>damnable Schisme</hi> and <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie.</hi> An excellent Guide, I promise you, this, is it not?</p>
               <p>Nor <hi>secondly,</hi> are these, though <hi>A. C.</hi> calles them <note place="margin">Punct. 2. A. C. p. 65.</note> so, <hi>annexed Reasons;</hi> For hee calls them so, but to blaunch the matter, as if they fell upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position <hi>ab extra,</hi> accidentally, and from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, Whereas they are not annexed, or pinned on, but flow naturally out of the <hi>Proposition</hi> it selfe. For the <hi>Proposition</hi> would seeme to be <hi>Metaphysicall,</hi> and is applyable indifferently to any <hi>Common Beliefe</hi> of dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Parties,</hi> be the point in difference what it will. Therfore if there be any thing <hi>Hereticall, Schismaticall,</hi> or any way <hi>evill</hi> in the <hi>Point,</hi> this proposition being neither <hi>Vniversally,</hi> nor <hi>necessarily</hi> true, must needes

cast him, that relyes upon it, upon all these Rocks of <hi>Heresie, Schisme,</hi> or what ever else followes the <hi>matter of the Proposition.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, A.

Nor can that Place by <hi>any Art</hi> be shifted, or by any <hi>Violence</hi> wrested from <hi>Calvine's</hi> true meaning of the <hi>Presence of Christ in and at the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Sacrament of the Fucharist,</hi> to any Supper in Heaven whatsoever. But most manifest it is, that <hi>Quod legerim,</hi> for ought I have read, will not serve <hi>Bellarmine</hi> to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse him.

<pb n="294" facs="tcp:13491:161"/>
So <hi>Calvine</hi> sayes it foure times, and <hi>Bellarmine</hi> quotes the places; and yet he sayes in the very next Chapter, That never any Protestant said so, to his Reading.

                     <p>Secondly, <hi>Si aliqui corum minorem Filium esse dixe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt quàm Pater est, ejusdem tamen substantiae non negâ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt.</hi> But this is but <hi>si aliqui,</hi> if any so 'twas doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, this too, though <hi>Prateolus</hi> delivers it positively.</p>

Therefore they erred not in Fundamentall Points of Faith. And</p>
                     <p>Lastly, All that can farther be said against them, is, That some of them, to win the <hi>Goths</hi> to them, when they were powerfull, said, <hi>Hoc se Credere quod &amp; illi Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dunt.</hi> Now the <hi>Goths</hi> (for the most) were <hi>Arrians.</hi> But then, saith S. <hi>Aug.</hi> they were but <hi>nonnulli,</hi> some of them. And of this some it was no more Certaine, then <hi>sicut au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divimus,</hi> as we have heard, S. <hi>Aug.</hi> knew it not. And then if it were true of some, yet <hi>Majorum suorum Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate convincuntur; Quia nec</hi> Donatus <hi>ipse sic cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didisse asseritur, de cujus parte se esse gloriantur.

Har. 69.</hi> But then S. <hi>Aug.</hi> adds there also, <hi>nec facilè in iis quisquam,</hi> that scarce any of the Donatists did so much as know, that this <hi>Donatus</hi> held that Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, much lesse did they believe it themselves. <hi>S.

For in regard of the <hi>Schisme</hi> the <hi>Donatist</hi> was in one respect worse, and in greater danger of damnation then the <hi>Romanist</hi> now is: And in an other respect better, and in lesse danger. The <hi>Donatist</hi> was in greater danger of damnation, if you consider the Schisme it selfe then; for they brake from the <hi>Orthodox Church</hi> without any cause given them. And here it doth not follow, if the <hi>Romanist</hi> have a <hi>Possibility of Salvation,</hi> therefore a <hi>Donatist</hi> hath. But if you consider the <hi>Cause</hi> of the Schisme now, then the <hi>Donatist</hi> was in lesse danger of Damnation then the <hi>Romanist</hi> is; Because the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> gave the first and the greatest cause of the Schisme (as is prooved <note n="†" place="margin">§. 21.

                  <hi>before.)</hi> And therefore here it doth not follow, That if a <hi>Donatist</hi> have possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Salvation, Therefore a <hi>Romanist</hi> hath; For a lesser Offender may have that possibility of safety, which a greater hath not.</p>

For he that confesses a <hi>possibility of Salvation,</hi> doth not therby confesse <hi>no perill of Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> in the same way Yea but if some <hi>Protestants should say there is perill of Damnation to live and dye in the Romane Faith, their saying is nothing in comparison of the number or worth of those that say, there is none.</hi> So <hi>A.

<pb n="303" facs="tcp:13491:165"/>
where you say, that they which affirme this perill of Damnation, are contradicted by their owne more <note place="margin">A. C. p. 66.</note> Learned Brethren.</p>
               <p>And thus having cleared the way against the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> of <hi>A. C.</hi> to the two former Instances, I will now proceed (as I <note n="†" place="margin">§. 35. N. 4.</note> promised) to make this farther appeare, that <hi>A. C.</hi> and his fellowes dare not stand to that ground, which is here laid downe. Namely, <hi>That in Poynt of Faith and Salvation, it is safest for a man to take that way which the Adversary Confesses to be true, or whereon the differing Parties agree.</hi> And that if they doe stand to it, they must be forced to maintaine the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in many things against the <hi>Church of Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>first,</hi> I Instance in the <hi>Article of our Saviour Christs Descent into Hell.</hi> I hope the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves <note place="margin">Punct. 1.</note> this <hi>Article,</hi> and withall that <hi>Hell</hi> is the place of the Damned, so doth the <hi>Church of England.</hi> In this then these distenting Churches agree: Therefore ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the former <hi>Rule</hi> (yea and here in <hi>Truth</hi> too) 'tis safest for a man to believe this <hi>Article of the Creed,</hi> as both agree: That is, that Christ descended in Soule into the Place of the Damned. But this the <hi>Romanists</hi> will not endure at any hand. <hi>For the</hi>

                  <hi>Schoole agree in it, That the Soule of Christ in the time of his death went really no farther then in Limbum Patrum,</hi> which is not the place of the Damned, but a <hi>Region</hi> or <hi>Quarter</hi> in the upper part of Hell, (as they call it) built up there by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manist,</hi> without <hi>Licence</hi> of either <hi>Scripture,</hi> or the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church.</hi> And a man would wonder how those Builders <hi>with untempered mortar</hi> found light enough in that darke Place to build as they have done. <note place="margin">

                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> I'le instance in the <hi>Institution of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in both kinds.</hi> That Christ <hi>Instituted</hi> it so, is confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed <note place="margin">Punct. 2.</note> by both Churches; that the <hi>Ancient Churches receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> it so, is agreed by both Churches. Therefore
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:13491:166"/>
according to the former <hi>Rule</hi> (and here in <hi>Truth</hi> too) 'tis safest for a man to receive this Sacrament in both kindes. And yet here this Ground of <hi>A.

For they have no shew to maintaine this, but the fiction of <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Aquin, That he which receives the Body of Christ, receives also his Blood per † concomitantiam,</hi> by concomitancy; because the Blood goes alwayes with the Body, of which <hi>Terme</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Tho. p. 3. q. 76. A. 2. c. &amp; alibi passim.</note> 
                  <hi>Thomas</hi> was the first <hi>Author</hi> I can yet finde. <hi>First</hi> then, if this be true, I hope Christ knew it: And then why did he so unusefully institute it in both kindes? <hi>Next,</hi> if this be true, <hi>Concomitancy</hi> accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies the Priest, as well as the People; and then why may not he receive it in one kinde also? <hi>Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> this is apparently not true; For the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is a Sacrament <hi>Sanguinis effusi,</hi> of Blood shed, and poured out; And Blood poured out, and so severed from the Body, goes not along with the Body <hi>per con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitantiam.</hi> And yet Christ must rather erre, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed I know not how in the Institution of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in both kindes, rather then the <hi>Holy unerr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Church of Rome</hi> may doe amisse in the Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for it, and the Administration of it in one kinde. Nor will the Distinction, <hi>That Christ insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted this as a Sacrifice, to which both kindes were necessary,</hi> serve the turne; For suppose that true, yet hee instituted it, as a Sacrament also,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:13491:166"/>
or els that Sacrament had no Institution from Christ, which I presume <hi>A. C.</hi> dares not affirme. And that Institution which this Sacrament had from Christ, was in <hi>both kindes.</hi>

And being pressed, why then they refused to come to our Churches, and serve God with us?

here let <hi>A.

If hee forsake his ground, then it is not saf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est in point of Divine Worship to joyne in Faith as the dissenting Parties agree, or to stand to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versaries owne Confession.

                  <hi>the thing is true, but not therefore true, because the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting Parties agree in it,</hi> or because the adverse Part Confesses it.

with D. <hi>White</hi> the late Reverend <hi>B.</hi> of <hi>Ely,</hi> and he avovvs this, and no other Answer. <hi>He was asked in the Conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene you, Whether Popish Errours were Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall? To this he gave an Answer, by Distinction of the Persons which held and professed the Errours: Namely, that the Errours were Fundamentall</hi> reductivè, <hi>by a Reducement, if they which embraced them, did pertinaciously adhere to them, having sufficient meanes to be better informed: Nay far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they were</hi> materially <hi>and in the very kinde and Nature of them,</hi> Leaven, Drosse, <note n="a" place="margin">1 Cor. 3. 12.</note> Hay, and Stubble. <hi>Yet he thought withall, that such as were misled by education, or long custome, or over valuing the Soveraignty of the Roman Church, and did in simplicity of heart embrace them, might by their generall Repentance, and Faith in the Merit of Christ, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with Charity, and other Uertues, finde mercy at Gods hands. But that he should say</hi> signanter, <hi>and expresly, That none either of yours, or your Fellowes Errours were damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, so long as you hold them not against Conscience, that he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly disavowes. You delivered nothing to extort such a Confes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from him. And for your selfe, he could observe but small love of Truth, few signes of Grace in you (as be told me:) Yet he will not presume to judge you, or your salvation; It is the</hi>

                  <hi>Word of Christ that must judge you at the later day.</hi> For your <hi>Conscience,</hi> you are the happier in your Errour, that you hold nothing against it, especially if you speak not against it, while you say so. But this no man can know, but your selfe, <note n="c" place="margin">1 Cor. 2. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>For no man knowes the thoughts of a man, but the Spirit of a man that is within him,</hi> to which I leave you.</p>
               <p>To this <hi>A. C.</hi> replyes. And <hi>first</hi> he grants, <hi>that</hi>

<pb n="318" facs="tcp:13491:173"/>
was not present at the first or second Conference. <hi>Thirdly, he saith that the Reason which moved the Iesuite, to say D.</hi> White <hi>had secured him, was because the said Doctor had granted in his first Conference with the Iesuite these things following.</hi> First, <hi>That there must be one or other Church continually visible.</hi> Though D. <hi>White,</hi> late <hi>Bishop</hi> of <hi>Ely,</hi> was more able to Answer for himselfe, yet since he is now dead, and is thus drawne into this Discourse, I shall, as well as I can, doe him the right, which his Learning, and Paines for the Church deserved. And to this <hi>first,</hi> I grant as well as he, <hi>That there must be some one Church or other continually visible:</hi> Or that the <hi>Militant Church</hi> of Christ must alwayes be visible in some <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars,</hi> or <hi>Particular</hi> at least (expresse it as you please.) For if this be not so, then there may be a time in which there shall not any where be a visible Profession of the <hi>Name of Christ;</hi> which is contrary to the whole scope and promise of the <hi>Gospell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well. What then? Why then <hi>A. C.</hi> addes, <hi>That</hi>

                  <hi>D.</hi> White <hi>confessed that this Visible Church had in all ages</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. C. p. 67.</note> 
                  <hi>taught that unchanged Faith of Christ in all Points Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall.</hi> D. <hi>White</hi> had reason to say that the <hi>Visible Church</hi> taught so; but that <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that Particular Visible Church</hi> did so teach, sure D. <hi>White</hi> affirmed not; unlesse in case the <hi>whole Visible Church</hi> of Christ were reduced to one <hi>Particular</hi> only.</p>
               <p>But suppose this. What then? Why then <hi>A. C.</hi> telles <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> us, that <hi>D. White being urged to assigne such a Church, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presly</hi>

                     </gap> Doctrinall Things,</hi> and those about the Faith, he cannot assigne the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> for olding them in all ages. But if he meane <hi>different</hi> in the <hi>Foundation</hi> it selfe, the <hi>Creed;</hi> then his urging to assigne a <hi>Church,</hi> is void, be it <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other For if any other <hi>Church</hi> shall thus differ from <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Rome</hi> from it selfe, as to deny this <hi>Foundation,</hi> it doth not, it cannot remaine a Differing Church, <hi>sed transit in Non Ecclesiam,</hi> but passes away into No-Church, upon the Denyall of the <hi>Creed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now what <hi>A. C.</hi> meanes, he expresses not, nor <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> can I tell, but I may peradventure guesse noare it, by that which out of these <hi>Premises,</hi> he would inferre. For hence he tels us, <hi>he gathered that D.</hi> Whito's <hi>Opinion</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. C. p. 67.</note> 
                  <hi>was, That the Romane Church held and taught in all ages un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed Faith in all Fundamentall Points, and did not in any age erre in any Point Fundamentall.</hi> This is very well. For <hi>A. C<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.</hi> confesses, he did but <hi>gather,</hi> that this was Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>White's</hi> Opinion. And what if he gathered that, which grew not there, nor thence? For suppose all the <hi>Premises</hi> true, yet no Cartrope can draw this <hi>Conclusion</hi> out of them. And then all <hi>A. C'<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.</hi> labour's lost. For grant some one Church or other must still be Visible. And grant that this Visible Church held all Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals of the Faith in all ages. And grant againe that D. <hi>White</hi> could not assigne any Church <hi>differing from the Romane,</hi> that did this; Yet this will not follow, that therefore the <hi>Romane</hi> did it. And that because there's more in the <hi>Conclusion,</hi> then in the <hi>Premises.</hi> For <hi>A. C<hi rend="sup">s</hi>.</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. C. p. 67.</note> Conclusion is, <hi>That in D.</hi> White's <hi>Opinion the Romane Church held and taught in all ages unchanged Faith in all Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentall Points,</hi> And so farre perhaps the Conclusion may stand, taking <hi>Fundamentall Points</hi> in their literall sense, as they are expressed in <hi>Creedes,</hi> and <hi>approved Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels.</hi> But then he addes, <hi>And did not in any age erre in any</hi>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:13491:174"/>
                  <hi>Point Fundamentall.</hi> Now this can never follow out of the <hi>Premises</hi> before laid downe. For say some one Church or other may still be Visible; And that Visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church hold all Fundamentall Points in all Ages; And no man be able to name another Church diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that hath done this; yet it followes not therefore, <hi>That the Church of Rome did not erre in any age in any Point Fundamentall.</hi> For a Church may hold the <hi>Fundamentall</hi> Point <hi>Literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and as long as it stayes there, be without controlle, and yet erre <hi>grosly, dangerously,</hi> nay <hi>damnably</hi> in the <hi>Exposition</hi> of it. And this is the <hi>Church of Romes</hi> case. For most true it is, it hath in all ages maintained the Faith unchanged in the Expression of the <hi>Articles</hi> themselves; but it hath in the exposition both of <hi>Creeds,</hi> and <hi>Councels,</hi> quite changed, and lost the sense, and the meaning of some of them. So the <hi>Faith</hi> is in many things changed both for life and beliefe, and yet seems the same. Now that which deceives the world is, That because the <hi>Barke</hi> is the same, men thinke this old decayed Tree, is as sound as it was at first, and not weather-beaten in any age. But when they can make me believe that <hi>Painting</hi> is true <hi>Beauty,</hi> I'le be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve too, that <hi>Rome</hi> is not only sound, but beautifull.</p>
               <p>But <hi>A. C.</hi> goes on and tels us, <hi>That hereupon the Iesuite asked, whether Errors in Points not Fundamental were damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 
                  <hi>And that D.</hi> White <hi>answered, they were not, unlesse they</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. C. p. 67.</note> 
                  <hi>were held against conscience.</hi> Tis true, that <hi>Error</hi> in Points not <hi>Fundamentall</hi> is the more damnable, the more it is held against <hi>conscience:</hi> But it is true too, that <hi>Error</hi> in Points <hi>not Fundamentall</hi> may be damnable to some men, though they hold it not against their <hi>conscience.</hi> As namely, when they hold an <hi>Errour</hi> in some <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Points,</hi> which grate upon the <hi>Foundation,</hi> and yet will neither seeke the <hi>meanes</hi> to know the <hi>Truth,</hi>
                  <pb n="321" facs="tcp:13491:174"/>
nor accept and believe Truth when 'tis known, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially being men able to Iudge; which I feare, is the case of too many at this day in the <hi>Romane Church.</hi> Out of all which <hi>A. C.</hi> tels us, <hi>The Iesuite collected, that D.</hi> White's <hi>Opinion was, That the Romane Church held all</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. C. p. 68.</note> 
                  <hi>Points Fundamentall, and only erred in Points not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, which he accounted not damnable, so long as he did not hold them against his Conscience; And that thereupon hee said D.</hi> White <hi>had secured him, since he held no Faith diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent from the Romane, nor contrary to his Conscience.</hi> Here againe, wee have but A C<hi rend="sup">s</hi> and the <hi>Iesuites Collection:</hi> But if the <hi>Iesuite,</hi> or <hi>A. C.</hi> will <hi>collect</hi> amisse, who can helpe it?</p>
               <p>I have spoken before in this very <hi>Paragraph</hi> to all <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> the Passages of <hi>A. C.</hi> as supposing them true: and set downe what is to be answered to them, in case they proove so. But now 'tis most apparent by D. <hi>White's</hi> Answer, set downe before <note n="†" place="margin">§. 37. N. 1.</note> at large, that he never said, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> erred onely in Points not Fundamentall, as <hi>A. C.</hi> would have it. But that hee said the contrary, <hi>Namely, that some errours of that Church were Fundamentall</hi> reductivê, <hi>by a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement, if they which embraced them, did pertina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously adhere to them, having sufficient meanes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation.</hi> And againe expresly, <hi>That hee did not say, that none were damnable, so long as they were not held against Conscience.</hi> Now where is <hi>A.

For if a <hi>Iesuite,</hi> or any other may <hi>collect Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions,</hi> which are not granted him, nay con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to those which are granted him, hee may inferre what hee please. And he is much too blame, that will not inferre a strong <hi>Conclusion</hi> for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, that may frame his owne <hi>Premises,</hi> say his Adversary what hee will. And just so doth <hi>A. C.</hi> bring in his Conclusion, to secure himselfe
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:13491:175"/>
of Ialvation, <hi>because he holds no Faith but the Romane, nor that Contrary to his Conscience:</hi> Presupposing it grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> erres only in <hi>not Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals,</hi> and such <hi>Errours</hi> not <hi>Damnable,</hi> which is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutely and clearly denyed by D. <hi>White.</hi> To this <hi>A.

                  <hi>at the Conference.</hi> I was not present at the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betweene them, so, to that I can say nothing as a witnesse.

                  <note place="margin">A. C. p. 67.</note> most true it is, there <note n="*" place="margin">

But all this rests upon the credit of <hi>A. C.</hi> only (For <note n="†" place="margin">For so 'tis said in the Title<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page, by <hi>A. C.</hi>
                  </note> he is said to have made that <hi>Relation</hi> too, as well as this.) And against his Credit I must engage D. <hi>Whites,</hi> who hath avowed another Answer, as <note n="a" place="margin">§. 37. <hi>Nu.</hi> 1. NUM. 8.</note> 
                  <hi>before</hi> is set downe.</p>
               <p>And since <hi>A.

And so he doth in the Relation of this <hi>Conference</hi> with me. <hi>pag.</hi> 50. In the <hi>first</hi> he stands upon it, <hi>That the Protestants</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">(2)</note> 
                  <hi>upon their Principles cannot hold, that all Fundamentall points of Faith are contained in the Creed. pag.</hi> 19. And so he doth in this. <hi>pag.</hi> 46. In the <hi>first,</hi> he would faine through <note place="margin">(3)</note> M. <hi>Roger's</hi> sides wound the <hi>Church of England,</hi> as if shee were unsetled in the <hi>Article of Christ's Descent into Hell. pag</hi> 21 And he endeavours the same in this. <hi>pag.</hi> 46. In
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:13491:175"/>
the <hi>first</hi> he is very earnest to prove, <hi>That the Schisme was made by the Protestants. pag.</hi> 23. And he is as earnest for <note place="margin">(4)</note> it in this. <hi>pag.</hi> 55. In the <hi>first</hi> he layes it for a Ground, <hi>That Corruption of Manners is no just Cause of separation</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">(5)</note> 
                  <hi>from Faith, or Church. pag.</hi> 24. And the same Ground he layes in this. <hi>pag.</hi> 55. In the <hi>first</hi> he will have it, <hi>That the</hi>

                  <hi>Holy Ghost gives continuall, and Infallible Assistance to the Church. pag.</hi> 24. And just so will he have it in this. <hi>p</hi> 53. In the <hi>first</hi> he makes much adoe about the <hi>Errig of the</hi>

In the <hi>first,</hi> he makes a great noyse about the <note place="margin">(8)</note> place in S. <hi>Augustine, Ferendus est disputator errans &amp;c. page</hi> 18. and 24. And so doth hee here also, <hi>page</hi> 45. In the <hi>first</hi> he would make his <hi>Proselytes</hi> believe, That <note place="margin">(9)</note> he and his Cause have mighty advantage by that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of S. <hi>Bernard, 'Tis intolerable Pride:</hi> And that of S. <hi>Augustine, 'Tis insolent madnesse to oppose the Doctrine, or Practice of the Catholike Church. page</hi> 25. And twise he is at the same Art in this. <hi>page</hi> 56. and. 73. In the <hi>first,</hi> he <note place="margin">(10)</note> tels us, That <note n="*" place="margin">Postquam dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessionem a toto mundo facere <hi>coacti</hi> sumus. <hi>Calv.</hi> Epist. 141.</note>

                  <hi>The Lady asked, Whether she might be saved in the Protestant Faith? Vpon my soule (said the Bishop) you may. Vpon my soule (said I) there is but one saving Faith, and that is the Romane.</hi>

For to believe the <hi>Scripture,</hi> and the <hi>Creeds;</hi> to believe these in the sense of the Ancient <hi>Primitive Church;</hi> To receive the foure great <hi>Generall Councels,</hi> so much magnified by Antiquity; To believe all Points of Doctrine, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally received as Fundamentall in the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> is a <hi>Faith,</hi> in which to live and die, cannot but give salvation. And therefore I went upon a sure ground in the adventure of my soule upon that <hi>Faith.</hi> Besides, in all the Points of Doctrine that are contio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted betweene us, I would faine see any one Point maintained by the <hi>Church of England,</hi> that can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to depart from the <hi>Foundation.</hi> You have many dangerous Errours about the very <hi>Foundation,</hi> in that which you call the <hi>Romane Faith:</hi> But there I leave you to looke to your owne soule, and theirs whom you seduce. Yet this is true too, That there is but <hi>one saving Faith.</hi> But then every thing which you call <hi>De Fide, of the Faith,</hi> because some <hi>Councell</hi> or other hath defined it, is not such a Breach from that <hi>One saving Faith,</hi> as that he which expresly believes it not, nay, as that he which believes the Contrary, is excluded from Salvation, so his <note n="a" place="margin">S. 22.

                  <hi>Scripture onely, can be infallibly sure that they believe the same entire Scripture, and Creed, and the Foure first Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Councels, and in the same incorrupted sense in which the Primitive Church believed?</hi> 'Tis just as I said. Here are many Questions in one, and I might easily be caught, would I answer in grosse to them all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; but I shall go more distinctly to worke. Well then; I admit no <hi>ordinary Rule</hi> left now in the Church, of Divine and Infallible Verity, and so of Faith, but the <hi>Scripture.</hi> And I believe the entire Scripture, <hi>first</hi> by the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Church; <hi>Then</hi> by all other <hi>credible Motives,</hi> as is before expressed: And <hi>last</hi> of all, by the <hi>light</hi> which shines in the Scripture it selfe, kindled in Believers by the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi> Then I believe the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Scripture <hi>Infallibly,</hi> and by a <hi>Divine Infallibility</hi> am sure of my <hi>Object:</hi> Then am I as sure of my <hi>Believing,</hi> which is the <hi>Act</hi> of my <hi>Faith,</hi> conversant about this <hi>Object:</hi> For no man <hi>believes,</hi> but he must needs know in himselfe whether he <hi>believes</hi> or no, and wherein, and how farre he doubts. Then I am infallibly assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of my <hi>Creed,</hi> the <hi>Tradition</hi> of the Church indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, and the <hi>Scripture</hi> confirming it. And I believe both <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Creed</hi> in the same uncorrupted sense which the Primitive Church believed them, and am <hi>sure</hi> that I do so <hi>Believe</hi> them, because I crosse not in my <hi>Beliefe</hi> any thing delivered by the <hi>Primitive Church:</hi> And this againe I am sure of, because I take the Beliefe of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> as it is expressed, and delivered by the <hi>Councels,</hi> and <hi>Ancient Fathers</hi> of those times. As for the <hi>Foure Councels,</hi> if <hi>A. C.</hi> aske how I have them, that is, their true and entire Copies? I answer, I have them from the <hi>Church-Tradition</hi> onely: And that's Assurance enough for this. And so I am
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:13491:179"/>
fully as sure as <hi>A. C.</hi> is, or can make mee. But if hee aske how I know infallibly I believe them in their <hi>true and uncorrupted sense?</hi> Then I answer, There's no man of knowledge, but hee can understand the plaine and simple Decision expressed in the <hi>Canon</hi> of the <hi>Councell,</hi> where 'tis necessary to Salvation. And for all other <hi>debates</hi> in the <hi>Councels,</hi> or <hi>Decisions</hi> of it in things of lesse moment, 'tis not necessary that I, or any man else, have <hi>Infallible Assurance</hi> of them; though I thinke 'tis possible to attaine, even in these things, as much <hi>Infallible Assurance</hi> of the uncorrupted sense of them, as <hi>A.

                  <hi>this is expressed in those particular Bibles, or in the Writings of the Fathers and Councels, which now are in the Protestants hands?</hi> Good God! Whither will not a strong Bias carrie even a learned Iudgement! Why, what Consequence is there in this? The Scripture now is the onely Ordinary <hi>Infallible Rule</hi> of Divine Faith, Therefore the <hi>Protestants</hi> cannot believe all this before mentioned, unlesse a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Text of <hi>Scripture</hi> can be shewed for it. Is it not made plaine <hi>before,</hi> how we believe Scripture to be <hi>Scripture,</hi> and by Divine and <hi>Infallible Faith</hi> too, and yet wee can shew no particular <hi>Text</hi> for it? Beside, were a <hi>Text of Scripture</hi> necessary, yet that is for the <hi>Object</hi> and the thing which we are to believe, not for the <hi>Act</hi> of our believing, which is meerely from God, and in our selves, and for which wee cannot have any <hi>Warrant</hi> from, or by <hi>Scripture,</hi> more then that we ought to believe; but not that we in our particular do believe. The rest of the Question is farre more inconsequent, <hi>Whether
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:13491:180"/>
all this bee expressed in the Bibles which are in Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stants hands?</hi> For <hi>first,</hi> we have the same <hi>Bibles</hi> in our hands, which the <hi>Romanists</hi> have in theirs; Therefore either we are Infallibly sure of ours, or they are not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly sure of theirs; For we have the same <hi>Booke,</hi> and delivered unto us by the same hands; and all is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed in ours, that is in theirs. Nor is it of moment in this Argument, that we account more <hi>Apocryphall</hi> then they do; For I will acknowledge every <hi>Fundamentall point of Faith</hi> as proveable out of the <hi>Canon,</hi> as we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it, as if the <hi>Apocryphall</hi> were added unto it. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, A.

Is this man become as God, that he can better tell what we believe, them we our selves? Surely we do believe all, and in that sort too: Though, I believe, were S. <hi>Athanasius</hi> himselfe alive againe, and a plaine man should come to him, and tell him he believed his <hi>Creed</hi> in all and every particular; he would admit him for a good <hi>Catholike Christian,</hi> though he were not able to expresse to him <hi>the formall reason of that his beliefe.

For the word <hi>(other)</hi> cannot be so used as here it is, but that we, as well as they, must be good <hi>Catholikes:</hi> For he that shall say, the old <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were valiant, as well as <hi>other</hi> men, supposes the <hi>Romans</hi> to be valiant men; And he that shall say, The <hi>Protestants</hi> believe some Articles; as well as <hi>other good Catholikes,</hi> must in propriety of speech suppose them to be <hi>good Catholikes. Secondly,</hi> as we do believe those <hi>some Articles,</hi> so do we believe them, and all other <hi>Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Faith,</hi> for the same formall reason, and so applied, as but just <note n="*" place="margin">§. 38. Nu. 13.</note> 
                  <hi>before</hi> I have expressed. Nor do we believe any one <hi>Article of Faith</hi> by our own <hi>fancy,</hi> or by <hi>fallible Authority</hi> of humane deductions; but next to the <hi>Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Authority</hi> of <hi>God's Word,</hi> we are guided by his <hi>Church.</hi> But then <hi>A. C.</hi> steps into a <hi>Conclusion,</hi> whither we cannot <note place="margin">A. C. p. 71.</note> follow him: For he sayes, <hi>that the Articles to be believed must be sufficiently made known unto us by the Infallible Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church of God, that is, of men Infallibly assisted by the Spirit of God, as all lawfully called, continued, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed Generall Councels are assisted.</hi> That the <hi>whole Church</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§. 21. Nu. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>of God</hi> is infallibly assisted by the Spirit of God, so that it cannot by any error fall away totally from <hi>Christ the Foundation,</hi> I make no doubt. For if it could, the gates
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:13491:188"/>
of hell had prevailed against it, which, our Saviour as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures me, S. <hi>Matth. 16.</hi> they shall never be able to doe. <note place="margin">Matth. 16. 18.</note> But that all <hi>Generall Councels,</hi> be they never so lawfully <hi>called, continued,</hi> and <hi>confirmed,</hi> have <hi>Infallible Assi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance,</hi> I utterly deny. 'Tis true, that a Generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell <hi>de post facto,</hi> after 'tis ended, and admitted by the whole Church, is then Infallible, for it cannot erre in that which it hath already clearely and truly determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned without Errour. But that a Generall Councell <hi>à parte ante,</hi> when it first sits down and continues to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate, may truly be said to be <hi>Infallible</hi> in all its <hi>after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinations,</hi> whatsoever they shall be, I utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And it may be it was not without cunning that <hi>A. C.</hi> shuffled these words together, <hi>Called, Continued,</hi> and <hi>Confirmed;</hi> for be it never so lawfully <hi>called,</hi> and <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> it may erre. But after 'tis <hi>confirmed,</hi> that is, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the whole Church, then being found true, it is also <hi>Infallible,</hi> that is, it deceives no man. For so all <hi>Truth</hi> is, and is to us, when 'tis once knowne to be <hi>Truth.</hi> But then many times that <hi>Truth,</hi> which being known is <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>Infallible,</hi> was before both <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent</hi> and <hi>fallible</hi> in the way of proving it, and to us. And so here, a <hi>Generall Councell</hi> is a most probable, but yet a <hi>fallible</hi> way of inducing Truth, though the <hi>Truth</hi> once <hi>induced</hi> may be (after 'tis found) <hi>necessary</hi> and <hi>Infallible.</hi> And so likewise the very Councell it selfe for <hi>that particular</hi> in which it hath concluded Truth. But <hi>A. C.</hi> must both speake and meane of a Councell set downe to deliberate, or els he sayes nothing.</p>
               <p>Now hence <hi>A. C.</hi> gathers, <hi>That though everything de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined</hi> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="15"/> 
                  <hi>to be a Divine Truth in Generall Councels is not abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. C. p. 71.</note> 
                  <hi>necessary to be expresly knowne and actually be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved (as some other Truths are) by all sorts: yet no man may (after knowledge that they are thus defined) doubt deliberately, much lesse obstinately deny the Truth of
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:13491:188"/>
any thing so defined.</hi> Well, in this Collection of <hi>A. C. First</hi> we have this granted, That every thing defined in <hi>Generall Councels</hi> is not absolutely necessary to be expresly knowne, and actually believed by all sorts of men. And this no <hi>Protestant,</hi> that I know, denies. <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is affirmed, that after knowledge, that <hi>these Truths</hi> are thus defined, no man may <hi>doubt deliberately,</hi> much lesse <hi>obstinately deny</hi> any of them. Truly, <hi>Obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately</hi> (as the word is now in common use) carries a fault along with it: And it ought to be farre from the temper of a Christian, to be <hi>obstinate</hi> against the Definitions of a <hi>Generall Councell.</hi> But that he may not upon <hi>very probable</hi> grounds, in an humble and peaceable manner <hi>deliberately doubt,</hi> yea and upon <hi>Demonstrative</hi> grounds <hi>constantly deny</hi> even <hi>such Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions,</hi> yet submitting himselfe and his grounds to the Church in that or another Councell, is that which was never till now imposed upon <hi>Believers.</hi> For 'tis one thing for a man <hi>deliberately to doubt, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destly to propose his Doubt</hi> for satisfaction, which was ever lawfull, and is many times necessary. And quite an other thing for a man upon the pride of his owne Iudgement, <note n="*" place="margin">S. 32. N. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>to refuse externall Obedience to the Councell,</hi> which to doe, was never Lawfull, nor can ever stand with any Government. For there is all the reason in the world, the <hi>Councell</hi> should be heard for it selfe, as well as any such <hi>Recusant</hi> whatsoever, and that before a <hi>Iudge</hi> as good as it selfe at least. And to what end did <note n="†" place="margin">S. <hi>Aug.</hi> L. 2. de Bapt. cont. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat. c. 3. Ipsaque plenaria, sape priora à posteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oribus emendari.</note> S. <hi>Augustine</hi> say, <hi>That one Generall Councell might be amended by another, the former by the Later,</hi> if men might neither <hi>denie,</hi> nor so much as <hi>deliberately doubt</hi> of any of these Truths defined in a <hi>Generall Councell?</hi> And <hi>A. C.</hi> should have done well to have named but one ancient Father of the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> that ever affirmed this. <note n="*" place="margin">S. 21. N. 5.</note> For the Assistance which God gives
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:13491:189"/>
to the <hi>whole Church</hi> in generall, is but in things <hi>simply necessary to eternall Salvation;</hi> therefore more then this cannot be given to a <hi>Generall Councell,</hi> no nor so much. But then if a <hi>Generall Councell</hi> shall forget it selfe, and take upon it to define <hi>things not absolutely necessary to bee expresly knowne, or actually believed</hi> (which are the things which <hi>A. C.</hi> here speakes of) In these as neither <hi>Generall Councell,</hi> nor the <hi>whole Church</hi> have infallible Assistance: so have <hi>Christians</hi> liberty modestly and peaceably, and upon just grounds, both deliberarely to doubt, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly to deny such the <hi>Councels De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitions.</hi> For instance, the <hi>Councell of Florence</hi> first defined <hi>Purgatory</hi> to be believed as a <hi>Divine Truth,</hi> and matter of Faith (<note n="a" place="margin">I know the <hi>Greekes</hi> subscribed that Councell, <hi>Sed in illo Concilio Graeca Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiae diu restitit.</hi> Pet.

I hope the <hi>Ancient Bishops</hi> and <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Primitive Church</hi> were assisted by God's Spirit, and in a plentifull measure too, and yet <hi>A. C.</hi> himselfe will not say they were <hi>Infallible.</hi> And <hi>secondly,</hi> for the Question itselfe, <hi>If a Generall Councell be not, what man in the world can be said to be of Infallible Credit?</hi> Truly I'le make you a ready Answer, <hi>No man;</hi> Not the <hi>Pope</hi> himselfe? No: <hi>Let God and his word be true, and every man a lyer, Rom. 3.</hi> for so, more or lesse, every man will <note place="margin">Rom. 3. 4.</note> be found to be. And this is neither dammage to the Church, nor wrong to the person of any.</p>
               <p>But then <hi>A. C.</hi> asks a shrewder Question then this. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="21"/> 
                  <hi>If such a Councell lawfully called, continued and confirmed,</hi>

                  <hi>may erre in defining any one Divine Truth, how can we be Infallibly certaine of any other Truth defined by it? For if</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">§. 10. N. 15.</note> 
                  <hi>it may erre in one, why not in another, and another, and so in all?</hi> 'Tis most true, if such a Councell may erre in one, it may in another, and another, and so in <hi>all of like nature:</hi> I say in all of <hi>like nature.</hi> And <hi>A. C.</hi> may remember he expressed himselfe a little before, to <note place="margin">A. C. p. 71.</note> speake of <hi>the Defining of such Divine Truths as are not absolutely necessary to be expresly knowne and actually belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of all sorts of men.</hi> Now there is, there can be no necessity of an <hi>Infallible certainty</hi> in the <hi>whole Catholike Church,</hi> and much lesse in a <hi>Generall Councell,</hi> of things <hi>not</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">§. 21. N. 5.</note> 
                  <hi>absolutely necessary</hi> in themselves. For <hi>Christ</hi> did not intend to leave an <hi>Infallible certainty</hi> in his Church to satisfie either <hi>Contentious,</hi> or <hi>Curious,</hi> or <hi>Presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirits.</hi> And therefore in things not <hi>Fundamentall,</hi>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:13491:194"/>
not <hi>Necessary,</hi> 'tis no matter if <hi>Councels</hi> erre in one, and another, and a third, the <hi>whole Church</hi> having power and meanes enough to see that no Councell erre in <hi>Necessary</hi> things, and this is certainty enough for the Church to have, or for <hi>Christians</hi> to expect; especially since the <hi>Foundation</hi> is so <hi>strongly</hi> and so <hi>plainely</hi> laid downe in <hi>Scripture</hi> and the <hi>Creed,</hi> that a modest man might justly wonder why any man should run to any <hi>later Councell,</hi> at least for any <hi>Infallible certainty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet <hi>A. C.</hi> hath more Questions to aske; and his <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="22"/> next is, <hi>How we can (according to the ordinary Course) be</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">A. C. p. 72.</note> 
                  <hi>Infallibly assured that it erres in one, and not in another, when it equally by one and the same Authority defines both to be Divine Truth? A. C.</hi> taking here upon him to defend M. <hi>Fisher</hi> the <hi>Jesuite</hi> could not but see what I had <hi>formerly</hi> written concerning this difficult Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on about <hi>Generall Councels.</hi> And to all that (being large) he replied little or nothing. Now when he thinks that may be forgotten, or as if it did not at all lie in his way, he here turnes <hi>Questionist,</hi> to disturbe that businesse, and indeed the Church, as much as he can. But to this Question also I answer againe, If any <hi>Generall-Councell</hi> doe now erre, either it erres in <hi>things absolutely necessary to Salvation,</hi> or in things <hi>not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary.</hi> If it erre in <hi>things Necessary,</hi> we can be infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly assured by the <hi>Scripture,</hi> the <hi>Creeds,</hi> the <hi>foure first Councels,</hi> and the <hi>whole Church,</hi> where it erres in one, and not in another. If it be <hi>in non necessariis,</hi> in things not necessary, 'tis not requisite that we should have for them an infallible assurance. As for that which followes, it is notoriously both <hi>cunning,</hi> and <hi>false.</hi> 'Tis <hi>false</hi> to suppose that a Generall Councell defining two things for Divine Truths, and erring in one, but not erring in another, doth define both equally <hi>by one, and the same Authority.</hi> And 'tis cunning, because these
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:13491:194"/>
words <hi>(by the same Authority)</hi> are <hi>equivocall,</hi> and must be distinguished, that the Truth, which <hi>A. C.</hi> would hide, may appeare. Thus then, suppose a <hi>Generall Councell</hi> erring in one point, and not in another, it doth define both, and <hi>equally by the same delegated Authority which that Councell hath received from the Catholike Church.</hi> But it doth not define both, and much lesse equally, <hi>by the same Authority of the Scripture,</hi> (which must be the Councels <hi>Rule,</hi> as well as private mens) no nor by the same Authority of the whole Catholike Church (who did not intentionally give them equall <hi>power</hi> to define <hi>Truth,</hi> and <hi>errour</hi> for Truth.) And I hope <hi>A C.</hi> dares not say the <hi>Scripture</hi> (according to which all Councels, that will uphold Divine Truth, must Determine) doth equally give either <hi>ground</hi> or <hi>power</hi> to define <hi>Errour</hi> and <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To his former Questions <hi>A. C.</hi> adds, <hi>That if we leave this to be examined by any private man, this exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>

                  <hi>and this by another without end, or ever comming to Infallible certainty necessarily required in that one faith which is necessary to salvation, and to that peace and unity which ought to be in the Church.</hi> Will this inculcating the same thing never be left?

Secondly,</hi> the true story of that <hi>Epistle,</hi> and that which led S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> into this Expression, was this. <hi>Cornelius</hi> then chosen <hi>Pope,</hi> expostulates with S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> That his Letters to <hi>Rome</hi> were directed onely to the <hi>Clergy</hi> there, and not to <hi>Him,</hi> and takes it ill, as if S. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> had thereby seemed to disapprove his <hi>Election.</hi> S. <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian</hi> replies, That by reason of the <hi>Schisme</hi> moov'd then by <hi>Novatian,</hi> it was uncertaine in <hi>Africk</hi> which of the Two had the more <hi>Canonicall right to the Sea of Rome;</hi> and that therfore he nam'd him not. But yet that during this uncertainty, he exhorted all that sailed thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>ut Ecclesiae Catholicae Radicem &amp; Matricem agnoscerent &amp; tenerent:</hi> That in all their carriage they should
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:13491:197"/>
acknowledge, and so hold themselves unto the <hi>Vnity</hi> of the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> which is the <hi>Root and Matrix of it,</hi> and the only way to avoid participation in the <hi>Schisme.</hi> And that this must be S. <hi>Cyprian's</hi> meaning I shall thus proove. <hi>First,</hi> because, This could not be his meaning or Intention, <hi>That the Sea of Rome was the Root or Matrix of the Catholike Church.</hi> For if hee had told them so, hee had left them in as great, or greater difficulty, then hee found them. For there was then an <hi>Open</hi> and an <hi>Apparent Schisme</hi> in the <hi>Church of Rome. Two Bishops, Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Novatian; Two Congregations,</hi> which respectively attended and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served them. So that a perplexed Question must needs have divided their thoughts, which of these <hi>Two</hi> had beene that <hi>Root and Matrix</hi> of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church. Therefore had S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> meant to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce <hi>Rome the Root and Matrix of</hi> the Catholike Church, hee would never have done it at such a time, when <hi>Rome</hi> it selfe was in Schisme. Whereas in the other sense, the Counsell is good and plaine, Namely, That they should hold themselves to the <hi>Vnity and Communion of the Catholike Church,</hi> which is the Roote of it. And then necessarily they were to suspend their Communion there, till they saw how the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> did incline, to approove, or disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proove the Election of the One, or the Other. And thus S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> frees himselfe to <hi>Cornelius</hi> from the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry least Touch of <hi>Schisme. Secondly,</hi> Because <hi>this sense</hi> comes home to <note n="*" place="margin">Baron. <hi>Annal. 254. Numb. 64.</hi> where hee cites this Epistle.</note> 
                  <hi>Baronius.</hi> For hee affirmes, That S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> and his Colleagues the <hi>African Bishops</hi> did <hi>Communionem suspendere,</hi> suspend their Communion, untill they heard by <hi>Caldonius</hi> and <hi>Fortunatus,</hi> whose the undoubted right was.

But because the Obstinate, and inflexible pertinacy of the other Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had not only refused</hi> Radicis &amp; Matris sinum, <hi>the bosome of their Mother and embracings of their Root, but the Schisme increasing and growing raw to the worse, hath set up a Bishop to it selfe. &amp;c.</hi> Where 'tis observable, and I think plaine, That S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> imployed his <hi>Legats</hi> not to bring the <hi>Catholike Church</hi> to the communion of <hi>Rome,</hi> but <hi>Rome</hi> to the <hi>Catholike Church.</hi> Or to bring the <hi>Novatians</hi> not only to Communicate with <hi>Cornelius,</hi> but with the <hi>Church Vniversall,</hi> which was therefore <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Root</hi> in <hi>S.

must needs bee the <hi>Root</hi> of <hi>Essence</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> and all other Particulars.

And this agrees with that knowne and received <hi>Rule in Art:</hi> That <hi>Vniversals give Essence to their Particulars, and Particulars supply their Vniversals with Existence.</hi> For as <hi>Socrates</hi> and every Particular man borrow their Essence from the <hi>Species</hi> and <hi>Definition</hi> of a man, which is Vniver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall, but this Vniversall Nature and Being of Man hath no <hi>actuall Existence</hi> but in <hi>Socrates</hi> and all other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular men: so, the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> and every other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Church in the world, receive their very Essence and Being of a Church from the Definition of the <hi>Catholike Vniversall Church of Christ;</hi> But this <hi>Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall Nature</hi> and Being of the Church hath no <hi>actuall Existence</hi> but in <hi>Rome</hi> and all other <hi>Particular Churches,</hi> and <hi>equall</hi> Existence in all her particulars. And should all the Particular Churches in the world fall away from Christ, save only <hi>One</hi> (which God forbid) yet the <hi>Nature, Essence,</hi> and <hi>Being</hi> of the Vniversall Church would both <hi>Exist</hi> and <hi>Subsist</hi> in that one <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular.</hi> Out of all which to me most cleare it is, That for the Churches <hi>Being,</hi> the <hi>Catholike Church,</hi> and that in <hi>Vnity</hi> (for <hi>Ens &amp; Vnum,</hi> Being, and Being one, are Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertible) is <hi>Radix,</hi> the <hi>Root, Head, Matrix, Fountaine,</hi> or <hi>Originall</hi> (call it what you will) of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all other <hi>Particular Churches.</hi> But <hi>Rome</hi> no more then other <hi>Churches,</hi> the <hi>Root,</hi> or <hi>Matrix</hi> of the <hi>Catholike Churches Existence</hi> or <hi>Place</hi> of her actuall Residence.

that sorrow. This I am sure of, if shee repent, and God forgive her other sinnes, she will more easily be able to Answer for her <hi>comming to Church,</hi> then for her <hi>leaving of the Church of England,</hi> and following the superstitions and errours which the <hi>Romane Church</hi> hath added in Point of <hi>Faith,</hi> and the <hi>Worship</hi> of God. For the <hi>Lady</hi> was then living, when I answered thus.</p>
               <p>Now whereas I said, the <hi>Lady</hi> would farre more <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> easily be able to answer for her comming to Church, <note place="margin">A. C. p. 73.</note> then for her leaving the <hi>Church of England.</hi> To this <hi>A. C.</hi> excepts and sayes, <hi>That I neither prove, nor can prove, that it is lawfull for one (perswaded especially as the Lady was) to goe to the Protestant Church.</hi> There's a great deale of cunning, and as much malice in this passage; but I shall easily pluck the <hi>sting</hi> out of the Tayle of this <hi>Waspe.</hi> And <hi>first</hi> I have proved it alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy through this whole Discourse, and therefore can prove it, That the <hi>Church of England</hi> is an <hi>Orthodoxe</hi> Church. And therefore with the same labour it is proved, that men may lawfully goe unto it, and <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate</hi> with it, for so a man not onely <hi>may,</hi> but <hi>ought</hi> to doe with an <hi>Orthodoxe Church.</hi> And a <hi>Romanist</hi> may communicate with the <hi>Church of England,</hi> without any Offence in the <hi>Nature of the thing</hi> thereby incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. But if his <hi>Conscience,</hi> through mis-information, checke at it, he should do well in that Case, rather to <hi>informe his Conscience,</hi> then <hi>for sake any Orthodoxe Church</hi> whatsoever. <hi>Secondly, A. C.</hi> tels me plainly, <hi>That I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove that a man so perswaded as the Lady was, may goe to the Protestant Church;</hi> that is, That a <hi>Romane Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike</hi> may not goe to the <hi>Protestant Church.</hi> Why, I never went about to proove that a <hi>Romane Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like</hi> beiug and continuing such, might against his Conscience, goe to the <hi>Protestant Church.</hi> For these words <hi>(A man perswaded as the Lady is)</hi> are <hi>A.

words, they are not <hi>mine.</hi> Mine are not simply that the <hi>Lady</hi> might, or that she might not: but Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative they are, <hi>That she might more easily answer to God for comming to, then for going from the Church of England.</hi> And that is every way most true. For in this doubtfull time of hers, when, upon my Reasons given, shee went againe to Church; when yet soone after (as you say at least) shee was sorrie for it. I say, at this time she was in heart and resolution a <hi>Romane Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like,</hi> or she was not: If she were not, (as it seemes by her doubting shee was not then fully resolved) then my speech is most true, that she might more easily an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer God for comming to Service in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> then for leaving it. For a <hi>Protestant</hi> shee had beene, and, for ought I knew, at the end of this Conference, so she was, and then 'twas no sin in it selfe to come to an <hi>Orthodoxe Church;</hi> nor no sinne against her Conscience, she continuing a <hi>Protestant,</hi> for ought which then appeared to mee. But if she then were a <hi>Romane Catholike</hi> (as the <hi>Jesuite</hi> and <hi>A. C.</hi> seeme confident she was) yet my speech is true too. For then she might more easily answer God for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which is <hi>Orthodoxe,</hi> and leaving the <hi>Church of Rome,</hi> which is <hi>superstitious,</hi> then, by leaving the <hi>Church of England,</hi> communicate with all the <hi>superstitions of Rome.</hi> Now the <hi>cunning</hi> and the <hi>malignity</hi> of <hi>A. C.</hi> lies in this, he would faine have the world think that I am so <hi>Indifferent in Religion,</hi> as that I did maintaine, the <hi>Lady,</hi> being conscientiously per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of the Truth of the <hi>Romish Doctrine,</hi> might yet, against both her <hi>conscience,</hi> and against open and avowed <hi>profession,</hi> come to the <hi>Protestant Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neverthelesse, in hope his cunning malice would <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> not be discovered, against this (his owne sense, that is, and not mine) he brings diverse Reasons. As <hi>first,</hi>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:13491:202"/>
'tis not lawfull for one affected as that <hi>Lady</hi> was, that is, for one that is resolved of the Truth of the <hi>Romane</hi> Church, to goe to the <hi>Church of England,</hi> there, and in that manner to serve and worship God; <hi>Because</hi> (saith <hi>A. C.) that were to halt on both sides, to serve two Masters, and to dissemble with God and the world.</hi> Truly, I say the <note place="margin">A. C. p. 73.</note> same thing with him; And that therefore neither may a <hi>Protestant,</hi> that is resolved in Conscience, that the profession of the true Faith is in the <hi>Church of England,</hi> goe to the <hi>Romish Church,</hi> there, and in that manner to serve and worship God. Neither need I give other Answer, because <hi>A. C.</hi> urges this against his owne <hi>fiction,</hi> not my <hi>assertion.</hi> Yet since he will so doe, I shall give a particular Answer to each of them. And to this <hi>first Reason</hi> of his, I say thus, That to <hi>Believe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> after one sort, and to <hi>practise</hi> it after another, and that in the maine points of worship, the <hi>Sacrament</hi> and <hi>Invocation,</hi> is to halt on both sides, to serve two Masters, and to dissemble with God and the world.

                  <hi>to professe a Religion in Conscience knowne to bee false.</hi> To this I answer, <hi>first,</hi> that if this Reason be true, it concernes all men, as well as those that be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded as the <hi>Lady</hi> was.

As if there were no Infallible certainty of Faith to be expected on earth, which were, instead of one saving Faith, to induce a Babilonicall Confusion of so many faiths, as fancies; Or no true Christian Faith at all. From which Evils, Sweet Jesus deliver us!</hi> I have Considered of this very carefully; But this <hi>Inference</hi> supposes that which I never granted, nor any <hi>Protestant</hi> that I yet know; Namely, That if I deny the <hi>Pope</hi> to be <hi>Iudge of Controversies,</hi> I must by and by either leave this <hi>supreme Judicature</hi> in the hands and power of <hi>every private man</hi> that can but read the Scripture; or els allow <hi>no Iudge</hi>
