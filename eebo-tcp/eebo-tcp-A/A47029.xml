            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <hi>TO Charge</hi> is to command with Authority, to do as a Judge does when he gives the Charge at an Aſſizes. To be <hi>Rich</hi> is to abound in Goods: And to be <hi>Rich in this World,</hi> is not to be truly Rich, and to abound in Goods that are truly ſuch; but it is to abound in this Worlds Goods; to abound in ſuch Goods, as do as this World does, paſs away, and ſcarce en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure but for a moment: Such as are good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but this World; ſuch as are got and loſt, or at leaſt left in this World, without being able to follow us into the other. So that to be Rich in this world, is not to be truly Rich, but it is in reality to be extream Poor; and therefore what could poſſibly have come in ſo ſeaſonable, as to charge ſuch Men of all others, not to be high-minded? For what is ſo inſufferable a ſight as to ſee a proud Beggar? And yet ſuch is the Caſe of all thoſe that are high-minded, becauſe of their
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:54128:3"/>
worldly Riches. They are nothing elſe but ſo many proud Arrogant Beggars, as is plain from the rich Man in the Goſpel; whoſe Poverty was ſo great, as to make him beg a drop of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the pooreſt of all Beggars, the beggar <hi>Lazarus.</hi> From whence you ſee what it is to <hi>Charge,</hi> and what it is to be <hi>Rich in this World,</hi> and what a ridiculous ſight it is to ſee a Proud rich Man.</p>
            <p>And ſo much for the Sence of each of theſe words apart, <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded.</hi> From whence I raiſe theſe following Obſervations; whereof the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt is this,</hi> That every Miniſter ought to ſpeak to his Hearers, as a Judge does when he gives the Charge at an Aſſizes; he ought to ſpeak with Power and Authority; he ought to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifie his Office; he ought to uſe great boldneſs of Speech; yea, he ought to ſpeak the Word of God with All boldneſs: And if he cannot do ſo already, he ought to pray to God, that he would grant him ability to do ſo for the time to come, <hi>Acts</hi> iv.29. And not only ſo, but you alſo are bound to pray for him, that by your Prayer, and the ſupply of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>utterance may be given unto him, that he may ſpeak boldly as he ought to ſpeak, Eph.</hi> vi.19, 20.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:54128:3"/>
and that he may in nothing be aſhamed, but that with all boldneſs <hi>Chriſt may be magnified in his body, whether it be by life or by death, Phil.</hi> i.19, 20. For, 'tis below the Character of God's Embaſſadour to uſe any ſervile Inſinuations, and baſe Flatteries in the delivery of his Embaſſage. God's Voice ought to be utter'd as the Law and the Goſpel were, by the Sons of Thunder. To beſpeak and to beg an Auditory, may well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough become a Priſoner at the Bar; but it's far beneath the Majeſty that a Judge repreſents. And therefore the Evangeliſt acquaints us, that the reaſon why the People were aſtoniſhed at Chriſt's Doctrine was, <hi>Becauſe he taught them as one having authority, and not as the Scribes, Matth.</hi> vij.28, 29. And the Rulers of the <hi>Jews,</hi> when they ſaw the boldneſs of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant Men, they marvelled, and they took know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them that they had been with Jeſus, <hi>Acts</hi> iv.19. Where you ſee, that the boldneſs and authority wherewith the Apoſtles ſpake, was judged a ſufficient Argument that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd to Chriſt, who had himſelf uſed that ſame liberty before. And therefore, if any Man would be took for a Miniſter of Chriſt, let him alſo take the ſame method that his Predeceſſors took: Let him never reaſon of Righteouſneſs,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:54128:4"/>
Temperance, and Judgment to come, but ſo as to make the proudeſt <hi>Felix</hi> Tremble. And let this ſerve for a Reproof to all ſuch Miniſters, as don't Charge their Hearers with what they ought to do, but come there to make Speeches, and to preach themſelves, and to turn the Church into a Theatre, and the Pulpit into a <hi>Roſtrum.</hi> And let it alſo ſerve for a Reproof to all ſuch Prelates as can uſe their Authority ſeverely e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough againſt all the Inferior Clergy; but when they themſelves come to Preach either before ſome Great Man, or at Court, can be well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough content to let go their Authority, and only to tell them of this or that thing in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, without ever telling them, Thou art the Man. And this brings to my</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second Obſervation, which is this,</hi> That every Miniſter is not only to Charge his Hearers as a Judge does at an Aſſizes with Authority, but he is alſo to Charge them with thoſe Sins that they are moſt Notorious for; as a Judge takes no Cognizance of any thing, but that which the Criminal is Charged with. And the Ground of this Obſervation is this: The chief Sins of rich Men are Pride, and a vain Truſt or Confidence that they place in their Riches; and the Apoſtle commanding <hi>Timothy</hi> to Charge rich Men with theſe Sins and no other, he does thereby charge us
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:54128:4"/>
alſo, to Preach moſt on thoſe Sins that our Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers are moſt guilty of. For, though there be no Sin of it ſelf truly ſmall; for the leaſt unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented Sin is of it ſelf Damnable; yet, becauſe a Man's boſom Sin is moſt dangerous, and does him moſt harm, therefore it is every Miniſter's indiſpenſable Duty to Preach moſt againſt thoſe Sins that his Hearers are moſt guilty of. For elſe, he preferrs a leſſer good, which is the reforming of the leſſer faults, before a greater good, which is the reforming, of the greater faults of his Hearers. He tells them of ſuch Faults as few or none of them are guilty of, and he does not tell them of ſuch as moſt, if not all of them, are Notorious for. He does after the ſame manner, as if a Phyſician ſhould apply himſelf to the Cure of his Patients ſore Finger, without ever taking notice of his Mortal Wounds; which, how ill you'd take it in your bodily concerns, all Men know: And why you ſhould not take it as ill in your Spiritual Affairs, is, to every conſidering Man, an inſtance of the greateſt madneſs. And therefore, as every Miniſter would avoid that heavy Cenſure of Preaching ſmooth things, and of pleaſing rather than diſturbing Men in their Sins; that is, as he would avoid the Cenſure of undoing Men, inſtead of doing them any good: So let him be ſure to Preach moſt againſt thoſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:54128:5"/>
Sins that his Hearers are moſt guilty of; the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of which will do them moſt good, and will procure him the Character of a Good and Faithful Servant, and Intitle him to his Maſter's Joy. And therefore, when St. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt ſpoke to <hi>Herod,</hi> of all his other Sins, he pitch'd upon that which he lov'd moſt, his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtuous Marriage: And when his Fore-runner <hi>Elijah</hi> ſpoke to <hi>Ahab,</hi> of all his other Sins, he pitch'd upon that which he lov'd moſt, <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard; and of all <hi>David's</hi> Tranſgreſſions, <hi>Nathan</hi> tells him of none but of his Murder and Adultery. And therefore, if there be in <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcus,</hi> or <hi>Moab,</hi> or <hi>Ammon,</hi> or <hi>Tyrus,</hi> or <hi>Judah,</hi> or <hi>Iſrael,</hi> three or four Tranſgreſſions more no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious than the reſt, they are all to be told of thoſe more than of all the reſt, as you have it at large in the Prophet <hi>Amos.</hi> For, when Sins do once begin to grow to an Head, and to become in Faſhion, they are to be roughly and ſeverely dealt withal. An ordinary concern in ſuch a Caſe is no better than Silence; and Silence in ſuch a Caſe is no better than downright Flattery. And to hold our Peace in ſuch a Caſe, is all one as to cry aloud, Peace, Peace. To let <hi>Herod</hi> go unreprov'd for his blaſphemous Oration, is to Flatter him; and to Flatter him is to ſay, This is the Voice of God, and not of Man; and that
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:54128:5"/>
makes work for nothing leſs than a Deſtroying Angel. And here now, if any one ſhould ſay, Alas poor Man! Theſe Times will never be in it. To ſuch a one I anſwer, Theſe Times will, and muſt, and ſhall bear it; but theſe Men, theſe Men will never do it. There is ſuch a Man's Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to be loſt, and ſuch a Man's Hatred to be incurr'd, and ſuch a great Place to be deprived of; and theſe Prudential, in plain Engliſh, that is, theſe ſelfiſh, vile Motives do hinder Men from the Right and conſcientious Diſcharge of their Duties. And therefore the Apoſtle being well aware of all this, and knowing that men would be very loath to diſpleaſe their Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, by telling them impartially of their Faults; the Apoſtle, I ſay, being ſenſible that men would be unwilling to meddle or to make with the rich Ones of the World, and eſpecially af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo ſevere a manner, he does therefore in the Verſes before my Text command <hi>Timothy,</hi> and Us in Him, in theſe words, <hi>I give thee charge in the ſight of God, who quickeneth all things; and before Chriſt Jeſus, who before Pontius Pilate wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed a good confeſſion, That thou charge them that are rich in this world, that they be not high-minded.</hi> And then, becauſe he knew men are apt to fear Princes and Lords, he there tells them of the <hi>bleſſed and onely Potentate, the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:54128:6"/>
King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he knew Men are apt to be dazled with the glittering Pageantry of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Pomp, he there tells them of Him who <hi>dwells in the Light, that no man can approach unto.</hi> And becauſe he knew Men are apt to fear Power and Authority, though they laſt for ne'er ſo ſhort a time, he there tells them of Him, <hi>whoſe Honour and Power is everlaſting</hi>; and then follow the words of my Text, as if he ſhould have ſaid, I know thou art afraid to tell great Men of their Faults, and therefore I charge thee in God's Name, that thou the rather do ſo, and that thou fear no Man's Perſon; I charge thee to fear God rather than Man, and to incurr the Anger and the Hatred of all the World, rather than diſpleaſe Almighty God. And here now, can any Miniſter hear this dreadful Charge, that runs in ſuch rigorous and peremptory Terms, and yet be afraid to charge the Rich Men of the World, and to preſs it Home upon their Conſciences, for fear of their Diſpleaſure? And can any Man find fault with ſuch a conſcientious Miniſter, as does, without all fear or favour, courageouſly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge this his indiſpenſible Duty? Can any Man do him any harm, that does him moſt good? Can any Man become his Enemy for telling him the truth, and endeavouring to deliver him from
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:54128:6"/>
Hell and Damnation? O pity us! pity us a little for Chriſt's ſake! Yea, for your own ſake pity us! For, if we do not tell you of your Faults, and repreſent them to you in the livelieſt Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, we commit the greateſt of all Faults a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God, and you, and our ſelves. We Diſhonour God, and highly provoke his Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, by fearing your diſpleaſure more than His: We undo you, by letting you go on in your Sins, without telling you of them; and we undo our ſelves too, by not doing our Duty.</p>
            <p>From all which you ſee, that every Miniſter is bound in Conſcience, to Preach againſt thoſe Sins that his Hearers are moſt guilty of; and if he knows of none of their particular Faults, he is then to tell them of thoſe Faults that their particular Calling does moſt expoſe them to. He's to Preach before Magiſtrates againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice and Partiality; before Lawyers againſt Colluſion and unneceſſary Law Suits; before Merchants, againſt Lying and Deceit; before Courtiers, againſt Ambition and Diſſimulation; before Great Ones, againſt Pride and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; before Gentlemen, againſt Riot and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality; before Officers, againſt Bribery and Extortion; before Country-men, againſt Envy and Diſcontent; and before Servants, againſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:54128:7"/>
Tale-bearing and Purloyning; which are the uſual Faults that all thoſe States of Life are moſt liable to; and therefore, are to be moſt of all minded of. And here now if any one ſhould ask me, And have the Clergy no Faults, that they ought to be told of as well as others? To which I anſwer, That I could heartily wiſh they had none! But alas! Charity it ſelf, that covers a multitude of Sins, does not, cannot hide theirs from the Eye of the World; Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it ſelf cannot chuſe, but raiſe my Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt them above all others. For, what an inſufferable Scandal is it, that there is ſcarce one Miniſter of a Pariſh that goes to his own Church, either upon the Week Days, or Holy Days, or <gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>even upon <hi>Sundays,</hi> unleſs it be juſt before Sermon, as if it were not worth their while to be ever at Prayers.</p>
            <p>Again, what does their frequent removal from a poor to a rich Benefice argue? Does it not argue either Covetouſneſs, or Ambition, or Lightneſs, or all; or any thing elſe, but a ſincere, and a hearty deſire to do good for God's ſake? And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeveral Councils and Fathers have decreed it unlawful for a Biſhop to change his Biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick; and that's one of the Reaſons that our Writers alledge againſt the Papiſts, why St. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> was never Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi>; becauſe they
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:54128:7"/>

            <p>Again, What do their Pluralities mean? Don't they argue, that they take more upon them than they are able to perform with a ſafe Conſcience? And that they care not what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of their Flocks, ſo that they may have but, their Rents? And are not theſe Excellent Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers, who ſcarce ever ſee their Pariſhes above once a Year<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and perhaps not ſo often neither? Certainly, theſe men are none of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, who made it his Buſineſs to ſeek the Souls and not the Riches of men, to ſeek them, not theirs. Certainly, theſe men never think of an after reckoning; for if they did, they would ſhew their Love to Chriſt by feeding his Lambs and his Sheep; and they would never think it below them to inſtruct thoſe men in their own Perſons, for whom Chriſt did in his own Perſon vouchſafe to die. And yet the worſt on't is ſtill behind, thoſe men have commonly moſt Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralities that are leaſt able to ſupply the leaſt Cure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> What means their non-Reſidence, and their Abode at Court and in Great Mens Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? Does it not argue they are more careful for the things of this World, than for thoſe of the next? Does it not argue them to be none of the Apoſtles Succeſſors, who thought it unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:54128:8"/>
to leave the Word of God and ſerve Tables? Does it not argue them to be quite of another mind than <hi>David</hi> was, who thought that one Day in God's Courts was better than a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand elſewhere? Yea, who had rather be a door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper in one of thoſe Churches, which they exchange for great Mens Houſes, than to dwell even in the Tents of Ungodlineſs. Certainly, theſe Clergy-men who are ſo much taken up with State Affairs, and Secular Employments, are none of Chriſt's Diſciples, who would not ſo much as be judge between two Brethren in the Diviſion of their Inheritance, <hi>Luke</hi> xij.14. Certainly, theſe Clergy-men who would be taken for Great Ones, and for Pillars of the Church, don't think how far they degrade the Royal Prieſthood, when they thus aſpire, and aſcend downwards to Temporal Judicatures; when they preferr Earth before Heaven, preferr Men before God, and the Things of this World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thoſe of the other. And therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> being very ſenſible how much it would be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the Royalty of the Prieſthood, to judge in Temporal Affairs, he does thus expreſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at large in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vi. <hi>Dare any of you, having a matter againſt another, go to Law before the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>njuſt, and not before the Saints? Do ye not know, that the Saints ſhall judge the World? and if
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:54128:8"/>
the World ſhall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the ſmalleſt matters? Know ye not that we ſhall judge Angels? how much more things that pertain to this life? If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, ſet them to judge who are leaſt eſteemed in the Church.</hi> Where you ſee, that the meaneſt Chriſtians are good enough to diſcharge thoſe wordly Employments, which, ſome great Prelates forſake their Flocks to obtain. And I do aſſure you yea God himſelf aſſures you, by my mouth, That, till the Axe be thus deeply laid to the Root of the Tree, till theſe things be throughly reformed; yea, till God's own Houſe be reformed firſt, no Reformation can be expected elſewhere; but the Sacrifice and the Worſhip of God will be baſe, and vile, and deſpicable in the Peoples Eyes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> No Man can ſcarce believe one word of that Religion, which the Miniſters that ought to obſerve it moſt, do in many, and indeed, moſt things leaſt obſerve. And thus I have given you my Second Obſervation, which is, That all Miniſters are bound in Conſcience to Preach moſt againſt thoſe Sins that their Hearers are moſt guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of. And I have alſo, without any fear of great Names, recommended it to their Practices by my own. And ſo I come to my</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third Obſervation, which is this,</hi> That the Riches of this World are apt to make men high-minded. For,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:54128:9"/>
               <hi>Firſt of all 'tis plain,</hi> That the Apoſtle Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>charge them that are rich in this World, that they be not high-minded</hi>; which charge had been to no purpoſe, if wordly Riches had not uſually produced that effect.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> 'Tis <hi>Agar's</hi> Prayer to God, <hi>Give me not Richer, leſt I be fall and deny thee, and ſay, who is the Lord? Prov.</hi> xxx.9, 10. Where you ſee, that Riches are not only apt to make men Proud, but that they are alſo apt to make them ſo Proud as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was; ſo proud, as to own neither Man nor God above them. Nor does this only happen in one or two particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but it's become ſo univerſal as to be made a matter of Prayer, to be delivered from this Evil of Riches. And therefore Holy <hi>David</hi> makes this to be the Prayer and Complaint of the whole Church together; <hi>Have mercy upon us, O Lord, have mercy upon us; for we are exceedingly filled with contempt. Our Soul is exceedingly filled with the ſcorning of thoſe that are at eaſe, and with the contempt of the proud,</hi> Pſal. cxxiij.3, 4. Where you ſee, that the whole Church of God does alledge, that Pride, and Scorn, and Contempt, and exceeding great Contempt are the uſual ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of thoſe that are at eaſe. And who are thoſe that are at eaſe think you? Are they not the Rich and great ones of the World? Are
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:54128:9"/>
they not ſuch as are incloſed in their own Fat, and have eyes ſwell'd with fatneſs? Such as have their Portion in this Life? Such as have their Bellies filled with hid Treaſures? And ſuch as ſay to their Souls, <hi>Soul take thy eaſe, thou haſt Goods laid up for many years, eat, drink and be merry?</hi> Yea verily, theſe Rich men are thoſe that are at Eaſe; and thoſe that are at Eaſe are thoſe that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſays are exceeding Proud, Scornful, and Contemptuous. And therefore alſo, Riches are apt to make men high-minded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again, Ariſtotle</hi> tells us in his Rhetorick, <hi>That Riches makes Men haughty and inſolent.</hi> And a greater than he, having deſcribed the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Wicked, concludes, <hi>This is the cauſe that they are ſo holden with pride, and overwhelmed with cruelty, Pſal.</hi> lxxiij. 6. And then he adds, <hi>They ſpeak of wicked blaſphemy, they ſpeak loftily, v.</hi> 8. and loftily indeed; <hi>for they ſet their mouth againſt the Heavens, and their tongue walketh through all the Earth, v.</hi> 9. They ſpeak well of all that is Evil, they ſpeak well of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous whom God abhorreth; and they ſpeak ill of God, and all that is Good. <hi>They are boaſters, proud, and deſpiſers of them that are good,</hi> 2 Tim. iij. 3. Nay, they are ſo Proud, that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe and undervalue the beſt of Men at ſo great a rate, as to value the Lord of Life, and the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:54128:10"/>
King of Glory at no more than Thirty pieces of Silver. Nay, the Pride of Rich men goes ſo far, that if <hi>Jeſurun</hi> wax fat, he will not only forget the Lord that made him, but He will alſo treat him with the greateſt Scorn and Contempt ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable; he will not ſo much as vouchſafe to look big upon Him, and to ſpeak proudly of Him, but he will uſe Him in the vileſt manner, he will lift up his heels againſt Him, he will kick at Him, and trample with his Feet upon the Lord that bought him. All which are the moſt Opprobrious Signs that Scorn and Contempt can be poſſibly expreſſed by: And yet all of them are nothing elſe but the uſual Effects of earthly Riches. And therefore alſo Riches are apt to make men high-minded.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> Riches bear ſuch a ſway in the World, and men do ſet ſo much by them, that, neither Wiſdom in Councel, nor Valour in the Field, nor Law in the Judgment Seat, nor Learning in the Schools, nor Eloquence at the Bar, nor yet Divinity it ſelf is wholly exempt from their ſpreading Influence; for we have known Chriſt himſelf become the price of Money, and his Temple turn'd into a Houſe of Merchandice, not to ſay worſe. Nay, ſo univerſally do Riches obtain, that <hi>Solomon</hi> dares affirm even of one part of them, <hi>That money alone anſwereth all
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:54128:10"/>
things,</hi> Eccleſ. x.19. From whence I draw this Argument, That if Rich men are maſters of ſuch Riches as all the World does ſet much by, then, 'tis no great wonder if all the World does ſet much by thoſe men that are maſters of thoſe Riches: And if all the World does ſet much by them, then 'tis very hard, 'tis very extream hard, if Rich men do not ſet as much, if not more, by themſelves. And what is it to ſet much by a man's ſelf, but to be Proud? And therefore alſo Riches are apt to make men high-minded. What is ſaid of Knowledge, being equally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicable to all humane Advantages? <hi>They puff up,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> viij.1.</p>
            <p>And here now, ſeeing Riches are ſo apt to make men high-minded, ought not all men to be extream cautious how they entertain them? For, if a man ſhould drink a Cup of deadly Poiſon, and ſhould immediately thereupon drop down dead in thy ſight, wouldſt thou have any great deſire to pledge him in the ſame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor? Or, if a man ſhould throw himſelf into a burning fiery Furnace, and ſhould preſently be eaten up by that devouring Element, wouldſt thou be ſuch a good Fellow as to throw thy ſelf in after him to bear him Company? And yet 'tis as equal, if not a greater Folly, for any man to ſet his mind upon the getting of Riches, that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:54128:11"/>
do uſually prove thus fatal to all their Owners: For ſays <hi>Solomon, This is a ſore evil which I have ſeen under the Sun, riches kept to the owners hurt, Eccleſ.</hi> v.13. And don't thou be over confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but that this may be thy Fate too. Don't thou be ſo Fool-hardy, as to adventure thy ſelf upon that Rock, upon which ſo many before thee have ſuffered Shipwreck. Caſt not thy ſelf into that Gulph, in which ſo many have loſt their Lives. And aſſure thy ſelf, this is no unſeaſonable Caution. For, Riches have now the ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witching Nature that they always had; and mens Nature now is as eaſily bewitched by them, as ever it was. And therefore, Riches being now as able to make the ſame Impreſſions upon men, and men being as ready to receive the ſame Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions as ever they were. Riches, I ſay, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now as able to work the ſame Effects upon men, and men being as eaſily wrought upon; what then can any man think, but that Riches will make men as Proud now as ever they did? Eſpecially, ſeeing the advantage on Nature's ſide is far more now than ever. For, the more the World grows, the worſe it grows; its Years and its Corruption, its old Age and its Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties coming upon it with an equal pace, and making their advances both alike. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ſeeing Rich men are ſo apt to be Proud,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:54128:11"/>
and ſeeing that Pride is a Sin that God abhors above all others, and ſo renders men liable to the greateſt Puniſhment. I can't content my ſelf with the bare proof of that aptitude there is in Riches to make men Proud, but I muſt alſo ſecond it with ſuch Reaſons as may diſſwade them from ſuch an inſufferable Vanity. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt of all,</hi> He that is Proud of his Riches, is Proud of thoſe that are lawfully, or thoſe that are unlawfully gotten. If they are lawfully gotten, then he ows them only to God, whoſe <hi>bleſſing it is that maketh rich, Prov.</hi> x.22. and the praiſe of Riches belongs not to him that's made, but to him that maketh Rich. And then, how can he value himſelf for thoſe things that are not ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to himſelf? How can he value himſelf for thoſe things that are not his own? This were juſt ſuch another Folly, as if a Pen ſhould aſſume to its ſelf the Writer's Praiſe: Or, as if a Wall ſhould fanſie thoſe beams that ſhine upon it to be of its own product. And if they are unlawfully gotten; then, I hope, he has far leſs reaſon to brag of them; for, this were nothing elſe but to brag of his Sin, and to be proud of Hell and Damnation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A rich Man ought not to be Proud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he that is proud of his Riches is proud of his own Diſgrace. For all Riches conſiſt either in Money, Land, Cattle, a great Retinue, or
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:54128:12"/>
the like; and he that is proud of his Revenue, is proud of That, and not of himſelf; and ſo he preferrs his Servant before himſelf, and ſo he is proud of his own Diſgrace. For, what greater diſgrace can there be, than to have a man's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant preferr'd before him? What greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace can there be, than to have the Horſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd before the Rider; the Beaſt before the Man, and a clod of Earth before the Landlord? And too, by ſuch a Judgment as the Landlord does moſt, if not only eſteem, his Own. And I hope, that if rich Men preferr their Beaſts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore themſelves, they can't take it amiſs if others alſo, out of a profound reſpect to their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, entertain the ſame worthy Opinion of them, that they themſelves do.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A rich Man ought not to be Proud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has leſs Reaſon to be Proud than the pooreſt Beggar has. For, God ſees that a Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar will make a ſhift to live honeſtly without Riches, and therefore he gives him none; but he ſees that a rich Man will ſcarce be honeſt, when he has Riches, and therefore he gives them him, that he may prevent his ſtealing or worſe; and then on whoſe ſide lies the Advantage?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> He that is ſelf-ſufficient is the beſt, and he that wants feweſt things comes next to ſelf-ſufficiency; and therefore, the poor Man, that
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:54128:12"/>
has no need of half thoſe Trifles, that the rich Man can't be without, is more ſelf-ſufficient than he is, and therefore is liker God than he is; and then alſo, on whoſe ſide lies the advantage?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> 'Tis a nobler thing to ſuffer an Injury, than to do an Injury; and therefore the rich Man being the moſt proud, and a proud Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt Injurious, of the two, who then is the better Man of them? and then alſo, of whoſe ſide lies the advantage?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Again,</hi> The uncertainty of Riches is ſuch, that lie that is rich to day, may be poor to morrow, then, and will be leſs pitied by all men in his pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the prouder he was when he was rich: And therefore alſo, the rich Man has leſs reaſon to be proud than the pooreſt Beggar has. For the pooreſt Beggar has a poſſibility of becoming rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, without the poſſibility of becoming poorer, unleſs any one ſteal away his Poverty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. A rich Man ought not to be proud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he has the greateſt reaſon of all other Men to be humble. For, his Accompts are the greateſt; for, to whom much is given of him much is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd. His Danger is the greateſt; for, he is ſet upon the moſt ſlippery places. His Temptation is the greateſt; for, he is moſt like to be Proud, which is the greateſt of all Sins. His Care is the greateſt; for, he pierceth himſelf through with
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:54128:13"/>
moſt Sorrows: And yet for all this, his Hopes and his Incomes are the leaſt; for, it ſeldom hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens that the Riches of this World, and thoſe of the next go together. The Happineſs of <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus</hi> being ſcarce ever to be met with in the ſame place. For ſaith Chriſt, <hi>Verily, I ſay unto you, that a rich man ſhall hardly enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. And again I ſay unto you, it is eaſier for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> Matth. xix.23, 24.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A rich Man ought not to be proud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God will take it moſt ill from him of all others. For, there is nothing ſo common as to hear a rich Man ſay, that his Riches do come from the Bleſſing and Favour of Almighty God; and 'tis uſual for him to hug himſelf with the conceit of his Soul's Proſperity for his Temporal Succeſs: and therefore certainly, he has more to thank God for, than others have. For, God is more kind to him, as he thinks at leaſt, than he is to his poorer Neighbours. And therefore, God being moſt kind to the Rich man, and the proud Rich man being the moſt odious, and the moſt ungrateful to Almighty God, it is but reaſonable that God ſhould take it moſt ill from him of all others. And therefore 'tis, that when God raiſes a Man up to great Riches and Honour, and
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:54128:13"/>
he does thereupon become proud, and looks big upon't; GOD is ſo far concern'd at it, that though he giveth to all Men liberally, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth not, yet he, cannot chuſe but upbraid and reproach ſuch a one openly to his face. <hi>Have I done ſo and ſo to thee, and haſt thou requited me thus for it? And inſtead of humbling thy ſelf before me, haſt lift up thy Heel againſt me, and haſt preferr'd my Gifts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my ſelf?</hi> Which, to any Man of common Senſe and Ingenuity, is worſe than a Mortal Stab, worſe than Death.</p>
            <p n="6">6. A rich Man ought not to be proud; becauſe, that's the way to have his Riches taken from him; which, to a Worldling, One would think, might be a ſufficient Argument againſt Pride, when all others fail'd. For, he that is proud, takes much upon him, and thinks well of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and expects a great deal of Honour ſhou'd be ſhewn him: And whoever honours himſelf, does rob God, to whom all Honour and Glory does of Right belong: And he that robs God, may be ſure to be robbed by God: For, as God becomes froward towards them that are froward; and as he lightly ſets by thoſe that regard him not, ſo likewiſe, the coming of God upon the Robber of his Honour, will be that of a Thief, both for its ſuddenneſs and its violence. And when God takes all away, What can be left?</p>
            <p n="7">7. A Rich Man ought not to be proud; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:54128:14"/>
he that is proud of his Riches, makes his Gold his God, and adores an Idol. And an Idol we all know is nothing in the World; and what an admirable Fool is he, that's proud ev'n of nothing? And what an excellent Bargain does that Man make, that parts with Omnipotence, for that which is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? and exchanges God for that which is not? yea, and much worſe too, exchanges him for the Devil, who was the firſt Author of Pride? and this is ſuch an Affront, and God takes it ſo heinouſly, and reſents it ſo terribly, that the Angels who were firſt guilty of it, were thruſt out of Heaven, and were not ſo much as ſuffer'd to abide in any part of all God's Creation, but were tumbled down into Hell; which (as well as Death, and Sin that are the cauſes of it) is a Place that God never made. And 'tis remarkable, that as a Proud Rich Man does change the Glory of the Incorruptible God, into this or that Piece of Gold: So likewiſe, God fits him with a Puniſhment accordingly, as is plain from <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Caſe, who, for his Pride, from a Man became a Beaſt. And 'tis as remarkable, That when God does puniſh a proud Man, he ſcorns to let him have ſo Honourable a Death as that of the Sword; and therefore he ſends either Frogs, or Lice, or ſome ſuch contemptible Creatures to pull down his Pride, and to level him with his Native Earth, and his Primitive Duſt and Aſhes. And 'tis well nigh as remarkable,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:54128:14"/>
that as <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>A Proud Man ſhould not tarry in his ſight</hi>; ſo likewiſe, God is reſolv'd to ſhew the ſame Indignation againſt him, by thruſting him, if poſſible, out of his Sight too, into utter Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> A Rich Man ought not to be proud; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, he that is proud, neither now is, nor can ſcarce ever be a true Chriſtian. For, that no proud Man is now a true Chriſtian is plain; for, he that is proud, thinks he has ſomething to be proud of; and he that thinks ſo, can never think himſelf an unprofitable Servant. He that is proud, thinks himſelf well; and he that thinks ſo, can never go to the Phyſitian, which none but the Sick have need of. <hi>He that is proud, careth not for God, neither is God in all his Thoughts, Pſal.</hi> 10.4. And he that careth not for God, is not likely to caſt all his Care upon him, and to part with his Profit and his Pleaſure, and his Pride, and his Life, and his All for God's Sake. <hi>He that is proud in heart, is an Abomination to the Lord.</hi> Prov. xvi.5. <hi>And God reſiſteth the proud,</hi> Jam. iv.6. <hi>And ſcorneth the ſcorners,</hi> Prov. iii.34. And thoſe who are an abomination to God, and whom God reſiſteth, and ſcorneth, are none of thoſe dear Children of his, whom he loves as the Apple of his Eye, and as the Signet upon his right hand. And beſides all this, he that is proud, is the Child of that Father, whoſe Works he doth, the Devil; and he
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:54128:15"/>
follows him in that which was his firſt &amp; his great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Sin, his Pride: and he that is guilty of as great a Sin, as the Devil himſelf can poſſibly be guilty of, can come into God's houſe no other way than the Devil does, in diſguiſe. And how ſuch a one can be a true Chriſtian, or how he has any more Right to God's Church, than the Devil had to Heaven, when he was thruſt out thence for his Pride, I dare adventure to let the proud Man himſelf be Judge of. From whence 'tis plain, that no proud Man is now a true Chriſtian: and that he can ſcarce ever be a true Chriſtian, is as plain from hence: For, he that is proud can ſcarce ever be reform'd, but is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner paſt all Cure. For, the Methods of reclaiming a Sinner, being only, either the Goodneſs, or the Severity of God: and the Goodneſs of God being only a Means to make him worſe, by making him eſteem that as a juſt Tribute that's due to his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits: and the Severity of God being only a Means to make him worſe too, by making him eſteem God unjuſt for puniſhing him that ought to be reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: It follows, that a proud Man is in a manner paſt all Cure, and therefore, can ſcarce ever be reform'd; and therefore, as now he is not, ſo neither can he ſcarce ever be a true Chriſtian: And what the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of that is, I hope he needs not to be told. And if all theſe Reaſons be not enough to make thoſe that are Rich in this World, to leave off
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:54128:15"/>
their Pride, they deſerve to periſh in their belov'd De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, and to become Martyrs to their Folly: and 'twere great pity indeed, but that they that do thus ſacrifice to their own Drags, ſhould become Victims to the Gold they adore.</p>
            <p>And thus you ſee, that Riches are apt to make Men proud; and the Reaſons why, Rich men ought not to be ſo. Which, one would think, were enough if poſſible, to reclaim them from their Pride. But alas! it's nothing near it. For, Rich men are ſo far loſt among their Riches, that they do know neither GOD nor Themſelves. And as a Rich Man's Pride does not ſuffer him to own himſelf to be but Man, ſo it does not ſuffer him to own himſelf to be a proud man: for, Pride is ſo odious and deteſtable a thing, that the proud man himſelf, will, like <hi>Haman,</hi> ſooner be hang'd, than endure but the very ſhadow of it in an Humble <hi>Mordecai.</hi> And therefore, as a man can't kill his Enemy, unleſs he knows him; and as a man can't cure his Diſeaſe, unleſs he knows it; ſo neither can a Proud man be ever weaned from his Pride, till he do firſt know, and own himſelf, to be ſuch. And therefore, ſeeing a proud man is thus wilfully Ignorant of himſelf; and ſeeing it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for him to be ever otherwiſe, till he be firſt brought to know himſelf, and to have a clear proſpect into the wretched Pride of his haughty Heart; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall preſent him with his own Picture, where
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:54128:16"/>
he may eaſily ſee himſelf, though not drawn to the Life indeed, (for that is as impoſſible as to repreſent his Dreams) yet however, ſet forth in ſuch lively Colours, that he may eaſily ſee himſelf, as through a Glaſs, as darkly. Nor indeed, if it were poſſible, is it neceſſary to draw him to the life; the very leaſt ſight of ſuch an odious Spectre being enough to make him for ever loath himſelf ſo far, as never to appear in publick, but in a Mask, always Transform'd.</p>
            <p>And here now I take for granted, That the Proud man's Picture is the Reverſe of an Humble man's. And an Humble man's Picture I take to be the ſame with that <hi>Eidyllium</hi> or Repreſentation that <hi>David</hi> has left us of himſelf, in the 131 <hi>Pſal.</hi> where he ſays, <hi>Lord, I am not high-minded. I have no proud looks. I do not exerciſe my ſelf in great matters that are too high for me. But I refrain my ſoul and keep it low, like as a Child that is weaned from his Mother; yea, my ſoul is even as a weaned Child.</hi> And this is ſuch an exact Picture of an Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble man, that it is the beſt that God cou'd draw him, and has the approbation of Omniſcience, that 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Good. And therefore, when the Diſciples Ambition prompted them to ask Chriſt who ſhou'd be greateſt among them, he that was the Brightneſs of God's Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon, and ſo knew very well what it was to draw a thing in it's proper colours, check'd their Pride by preſenting them with a Picture of <hi>Humility</hi> drawn to the life, a little Child: whom, whoever does not imitate, he
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:54128:16"/>
can never enter that Heav'n, where Humility does reign in ſuch a high degree, that the four and twenty Elders are content to proſtrate themſelves, and to throw down their Crowns of Righteouſneſs at the feet of the Lamb, the Child, <hi>Christ Jeſus.</hi> And lo! here's for you the Picture of Humility, drawn by the ſame Hand that made the World. And do you but take it and view it in another Light, and 'twill exactly repreſent the proud man. For,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt of all,</hi> A proud Man is high-minded, and that he diſcovers by the pride of his looks, the haughtineſs of his words, and the little care he takes what becomes of all others, ſo he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf may but lord it high enough, which is a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſign he looks upon all his fellow Creatures as deſigned only for his Service and Devotion. He is <hi>High-minded</hi> to ſuch a degree, that he ſcorns, and looks upon it as a great diſparagement to him, to keep ſuch mean Company, as God keeps: He reckons it below him to be ſeen with thoſe men, whom God thinks worth his while to make frequent viſits to, and to ſup with, and to be a conſtant Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Temples of their Bodies, and to leave heaven His dwelling place, for to come and dwell with them. He eſteems it a diſgrace to his Blood to match into ſuch a Family as deſcends from Heaven, has God for it's Author, and is Spouſe to Chriſt. He eſteems it a diſgrace to his Parts, to ſubmit his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to God's Wiſdom, and to captivate his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:54128:17"/>
to the fooliſhneſs of Preaching, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in the Verdict of Infallibility. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, what God calls Evil, he calls Good; what God abhors, he ſpeaks well of: He preferrs the Rich be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Good; he preferrs the ſcaly chequer'd back of a Serpent before a chaſt and a virgin <hi>Adam,</hi> and preferrs the Earth, the Devil, and himſelf before God. And this <hi>High Mind</hi> of his he diſcovers in the next place by the pride of his Looks. A Man's Eye, tho' there is no Truſt to be given to his Fore-head, being uſually a good Interpreter of his Mind. He ſcarce vouchſafes the beſt man above half an Eye, &amp; that he does with ſuch a diſdaining ſcornful caſt of it, as if all about him were ſcarce worthy of it, were but ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Graſhoppers. And what's a wonder to me, he that is ſo quick-ſighted, as to diſcern Beauty in a crawling Worm, and a naſty Swine; yea, and even in utter darkneſs too, can yet find none in that Face that ſhines with the Light of God's Countenance, and has God's Image far more viſibly ſtampt upon it than his own. Nay, he diſcovers ſo much <hi>Pride</hi> with his Looks, that he ſcorns thoſe Looks that <hi>God</hi> gave him, and therefore ſtrikes out all thoſe lively Touches of <hi>God's</hi> hand from his face, and ſupplies it with better and freſher colours of his own making: He ſcorns to be ſeen in God's Image, and therefore he makes himſelf ſuch a Viſard as prevents all Bluſhes, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends him from all viſible ſigns of Concern at Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof. And from ſeeing the pride of his Looks, let's
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:54128:17"/>
hear the haughtineſs of his Words Which, proceeding from the abundance of his heart, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover more of his high Mind. And truly a proud Man's Language does uſually run in a very high and lofty ſtile. His Tongue is his own, and none is Lord over it. His Tongue is double, and that makes him take himſelf for ſomewhat more than one Man, at leaſt; it makes him perſonate that Creature with the forked Tongue; which in the very infancy of the World, when it had yet ſcarce ſpoke one word, diſdained to talk of ought elſe but an Equality with the moſt High. And truly, its Viperous brood has ever ſince retained the poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Aſps under its Lips; and its big ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Words repreſent the largeneſs of the throat they come from, an open Sepulchre: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the abundance of that Heart, that's like the troubled Sea, ſwell'd to a prodigious great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Take but an inſtance or two of it, and you'll all be quickly maſters of it, if you are yet to learn it. If a proud <hi>Saul</hi> have ought to ſay to <hi>David,</hi> he preſently calls for the Son of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> and ſcorns to call him by his own Name. And <hi>Potiphar</hi>'s Wife ſays of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> This Hebrew Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant; and the <hi>Sodomites</hi> of <hi>Lot,</hi> This one fellow that came in to ſojourn; and Chriſt's own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen ſay of him, Is not this the Carpenters Son?
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:54128:18"/>
as if none of all three had been ſo much as once worth the Naming. But, alas! theſe are but mean inſtances to what follow: and nothing in compariſon to what a Proud <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or a Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemous <hi>Rabſhekah</hi> can belch forth upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. For ſays the one, <hi>Who is the Lord that I ſhould obey his voice to let Iſrael go; I know not the Lord, neither will I let Iſrael go.</hi> And the other ſays, <hi>Hath any of the gods of the Nation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his Land out of the hand of the King of Aſſyria? Where are the gods of Hamath and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena and Iva? Have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? Who are they among all the gods of the Countrys, that have delivered their Country out of mine hand, that the Lord ſhould deliver Jeruſalem out of mine hand?</hi> And thus I have given you a word or two of the proud Man's Language.</p>
            <p>And from hence let's take one ſtep more, and view him in the general Courſe of his Life, which will give us ſome farther diſcovery of his high Mind. And here we ſhall find, that he cares not what becomes of all others; he cares not what difficulties they grapple with, what Poverty they are reduced to, and what hard ſhifts they are forced to make, ſo he may have but his humor, and huff and hector it without control: which is a certain ſign, that he is ſo
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:54128:18"/>
proud, that he never thinks other Men to be fleſh of his fleſh, or bone of his bone, or elſe, he would be as tender of, and as reſpectful to them, as he is to himſelf. And that's the firſt part of the Proud Man's Character; he is high-minded, and has a proud look. And the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Second's this,</hi> He does exerciſe himſelf in great matters that are two high for him. And this is done when a Man lives above his Ability, Condition, or Calling; and is uſually ſeen by the exceſs of Diet, the exceſs of Building, the keeping too great a Retinue, the coveting of great Men's Company, and the exceſs of Apparel. But alas! theſe are not the only inſtances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Proud Man does exerciſe himſelf in ſuch matters as are too high for him: No, 'twere well if they'd keep themſelves within this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs. 'Twere well if they ſtretched not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves much further beyond their Line, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their meaſure. He's no Man now a-days that cannot order State Affairs, new model Churches, control the Prieſt, deſpiſe Dominion, ſpeak evil of Dignities; and judge of what is, and what is not; judge of thoſe things that he never knew, nor ſaw, nor heard, nor ſcarce dream'd of. For, what ſo common as to have an ordinary Man diſcuſs ſuch things as Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear heard, nor have entred into
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:54128:19"/>
his heart to conceive? What ſo common as to have the ſame Man diſcourſe of Myſteries, dive into Abyſſes, and fathom the unſearchable depths of God's eternal Decrees, and pity the ignorance of all ſuch as are not exactly of his Perſwaſion? What ſo common as to have moſt Men accuſe God's Providence, quarrel at his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Diſtribution of things, deny Him the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of earthly Kingdoms, and force him to be an idle ſpectator of humane Affairs? And what's this but to ſnatch the Scepter out of his hands, to de-throne Omnipotence, to prefer their own Wiſdom before God's, and to pretend to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the World better than Omniſcience? And if this be not to exerciſe ones ſelf in great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that are too high for him: If this be not the heigth of Pride, I am ſure it is not to refrain his Soul and to keep it low, like a weaned Child. Which is the</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Third part of the Proud Man's Character</hi>: For, a Child does wholly reſign himſelf to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Care, caſts all his Care upon him, and cares neither for Meat, nor for Drink, nor for Cloathing: cares for nothing but to pleaſe him. A Child does never call his Father's will into queſtion, never diſputes his Commands, never contradicts his pleaſure, but comes and goes, and does all things as he would have him. A
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:54128:19"/>
Child knows no difference betwixt himſelf and his Servant, has nothing in his Looks but a pretty innocent ſmile; and if any thing ails him, he creeps as faſt as he can into his Mother's Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom. And, how unlike a Proud Man is to a Child in theſe and all things elſe, but Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, needs no farther Proof. And thus I have endeavoured to ſhew the Proud Man to himſelf, as through a Glaſs, darkly; and I do heartily pray to God, that now he has beheld himſelf in it, he does not play the Natural, <hi>go his way, and preſently forget what manner of man he is, Jam.</hi> i.24. And now the Proud Man ſees his Diſeaſe, what remains but that I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe him two or three ſhort Rules how to Cure it. And,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt of all,</hi> Let him conſider the Puniſhment that attends it; for ſays <hi>Solomon, Pride goeth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deſtruction, and an haughty ſpirit before a fall, Prov.</hi> xvi.8. And again, <hi>Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the Lord: though hand join in hand, yet ſhall they not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puniſhed, Prov.</hi> xvi.5. The Decree it ſeems is unalterable; all the Wit, and Art, and Strength of the whole World cannot ſave him, <hi>he ſhall not go unpuniſhed.</hi> For, if the Angels themſelves could not eſcape Hell for their Pride, how then can Man expect to fare any better?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:54128:20"/>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let him often reflect upon the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion that wicked men put to themſelves, <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> v.8, 9. <hi>What hath pride profited us? or, what good hath Riches with our vaunting brought us? All thoſe things are paſſed away like a ſhadow, and as a poſt that haſted by. For,</hi> verſ. 14. <hi>The hope of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodly is like duſt that is blown away with the wind; like a thin froth that is driven away with the ſtorm; like as the ſmoak that is diſperſed here and there with a tempeſt; and paſſeth away as the remembrance of a gueſt that tarrieth but for a day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Let him conſider from what he was at firſt taken, and into what he muſt at laſt be reduced, his Primitive Duſt and Aſhes; and then he will have no need to brag of his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction. Let him conſider, that the beſt of men can claim nought elſe but Corruption for their Mother; and then again, let him ſee what cauſe he has to boaſt of his Blood and his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, and I know not what. Sure I am, he'll find no difference betwixt himſelf and the poor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Beggar that comes to his Door. But, he'll find his Skin to be as good as his own, though his Coat be worſe: He'll find his Breath as ſweet as his own, though his Fare be Courſer: And he'll find his Sleep to be as ſweet and as eaſie as his own, though his Bed be much harder. Both their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:54128:20"/>
Makes are the ſame, and the ſame eſſential In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients conſpire in both their Conſtitutions; and they differ in nothing from each other, but in ſome few little trifling Accidents of Time, Place, Colour, Stature, Fortune and the like, in which they differ as much from themſelves in the ſeveral Periods of their Age. And though indeed there be ſome little difference betwixt the Rich and Poor in this World; and though God hath ſaid unto ſome, <hi>Ye are Gods</hi>: yet he preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells them in the next verſe, <hi>But, ye ſhall die like Men, Pſal.</hi> lxxxij.6, 7. And then the difference will be ſeen, and felt, and ſmarted for, to the Proud Man's eternal Sorrow; when all his proud Looks, and his haughty Words ſhall be turn'd into howling, and wailing, and weeping, and gnaſhing of Teeth. Then the difference betwixt a <hi>Dives</hi> and a <hi>Lazarus</hi> ſhall be openly proclaim'd, when Devils ſhall drag the one into Hell, and Angels ſhall convey the other into <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Boſom. And now Go to, thou Rich and Proud, be as high-minded as thou wilt; <hi>But know thou, that for all theſe things God will certainly bring thee to judgment; and thou ſhalt feel a judgment worthy of God,</hi> Wiſdom xij.26.</p>
            <p>Conſider ſeriouſly of what I have ſaid, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all prejudice and partiality, and the Lord of his infinite Mercy grant, that both, you and I
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:54128:21"/>
may ſo lay it to Heart, as to live accordingly. <hi>Amen, Lord Jeſus! Amen and Amen!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bleſſing, and Honour, and Thanksgiving, and Praiſe, more than we can utter, more than we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, be unto thee, O moſt adorable Trinity, Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, by all Angels, all Men, all Creatures, and by us the Vileſt of all thy Creatures.</hi> Amen and Amen!</p>
