         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Name throughout the Kingdom, and elſewhere, are more
intereſted in the <hi>Theme</hi> and Subject of this compendious

to aſſault, to force, and overcome the Sobriety and
temperance of all true-hearted, real, practical, and bleſſed
Chriſtians, who make a conſcience of exceſſe (becauſe the
Scripture doth condemn it;) the chief alective Bait, or Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagem,
to draw men unto Drunkenneſſe; and the onely
Protection and Patronage to juſtifie and bear out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance

a great affront, indignity, and Diſhonour to your Majeſty,
that your Sacred health, your name, and Royal Crown
ſhold be thus prophaned and banded up and down in every
Drunkards mouth, in every Cup and Can; in every Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern,

At the beginning of his incomparable Book, He
urgeth many ſolid Arguments againſt drinking of
Healths; proving it to be a vain, Carnal, Heatheniſh,
and Fooliſh Cuſtome; and that which is againſt
the Rules of Charity and Juſtice; ſo that it muſt
needs be ſinful and utterly unlawful, becauſe it is a
violation of the Law of God, of Man, and Nature,
&amp;c.</p>
            <p>And whereas his Gracious Majeſty having ſet
forth a Proclamation, prohibiting the ſpending of
time in Taverns, Tipling-houſes, and Debauches,
further Care is now taken to prevent all ſuch Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
and infamous Actions.</p>
            <p>And whereas ſeveral Gentlemen at ſuch times,
have entred upon private quarrels, by Duel &amp; ſingle
Combat, upon ſlight, and, which ought not to be,
upon any provocation, His Majeſty out of his pious
care to prevent unchriſtian and raſh effuſion of
Blood, hath ſet forth a Proclamation, ſtrictly charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and commanding all loving Subjects of what
quality ſoever, That neither they, by themſelves, nor
by others either by Meſſage, Word, Writing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

ſuch challenge or appointment, nor actually fight
ſuch Duel with any of his Majeſties Subjects, or
others; or as a Second, or otherwiſe, accompany or
become Aſſiſtant therein. And His Majeſty hath
further declared, That every perſon or perſons who
ſhall offend contrary to his Majeſties expreſſe Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
ſhall nor onely incurre his higheſt diſpleaſure,
but thereby become incapable of holding or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
either Office or Employment in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties
Service, and never afterwards be permitted to
come into his Court or Preſence. And further, He
or They to ſuffer ſuch other paines and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as the Law ſhall inflict, upon Offences of
that horrid Nature.</p>
