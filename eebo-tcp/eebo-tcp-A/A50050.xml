         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is a threefold manner of citing Scripture out of the Old Testament used by Christ, the Evangelists and Apostles, for either they say simply, it is written, or it is said, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.4.7.10. Or it is written by the Prophet,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Laurentius</hi> in 1 Pet. 1.2.6. <hi>p.</hi> 122.</note> or in the Prophets, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.45. Or lastly it is written by the Prophet with the name expressed, <hi>Esay, Ioel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Marke</hi> 6.7. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.16. Neither is it strange, that neither the Chapter nor verse is named by them, since this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rithmeticall distinction both of Chapters, and specially of verses (which wee have now in our Bibles) is a very late invention.<note place="margin">See my Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and <hi>Beza</hi> on 1 Cor. 11.1.</note> This distinction of the Bible into Chapters and verses was made by men subject to errour, and therefore is found oftentimes irregular, separating that which ought to follow in a continued threed, and confounding that which ought to be distinguished.<note place="margin">That note on <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.26. the farthing was the least coyne used amongst the Jewes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that had from Mr <hi>Perkins</hi> on that place, yet how is that the least, if a Mite be lesse by one halfe? <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.33. Christ can moderate the observing of the Sabbath, as he doth the other Ceremonies of the Law, these are <hi>Calvins</hi> words, by which hee seemes to make the observing of the law a Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</note> The Bookes of the New Testament are 27. the Chapters 260. I do often in these notes relate the opinions and expositions of others, without passing my censure upon them, as <hi>Luke</hi> 2.7. I relate Mr <hi>Cartwrights</hi> opinion though I approve it not; for the originall is most cleere against it. And <hi>Mark</hi> 16.7. <hi>Peter</hi> is set behind, <hi>&amp;c</hi> is Mr <hi>Cartwrights</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation,
<pb facs="tcp:64320:5"/>
but not so solide; the marginall notes and those in the text may perhaps therefore sometimes interfeire and crosse each other, as <hi>Marke</hi> 1.1. I say in the text (out of <hi>Gerhard</hi>) that <hi>Marke</hi> relates Histories more largely, whereas the margent and the thing it self speakes, that he related them more briefly, sometimes the severall notes in the text it selfe may seeme repugnant, as <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.14. I say from <hi>Calvin,</hi> that Christ onely affirmes, that the Gospell shall be propagated to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most ends of the earth before his last comming, whereas v. 3. I observe out of B. <hi>Downam.</hi> that Christs comming is not treated of till, v. 23. <hi>Luke</hi> 5.39. Old wines are wont to be of a more gentle tast, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is contradicted by the margent and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>

I shall neede the favourable construction of Divines in the worke it selfe, since it is the first of that nature where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have adventured (though by the helpe of the best Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentators) purposely to explaine the sacred text. I desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (having had opportunity of consulting with so many <hi>Criticks</hi> for the accomplishing of my <hi>Critica Sacra</hi>) to make an Essay as it were in this booke, how usefull such kind of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was for the clearer explication of the Scripture. I shall therfore much varie I beleeve in these Annotations from those Englishmen and others, which have formerly expounded either the New Testament or whole Scripture. In such a multitude of Collections taken from severall Writers, and many of them long since, there may be some luxuriant branches, which might by Judicious Divines have beene thought fit perhaps to have been lopt off, could I have been so happy as to have had them first diligently scanned by such.</p>
            <q>Opere in longo fas est obrepere somnum.</q>
            <p>I shall willingly submit it to the Judgement of experienced Divines, and such especially as are versed in this kind of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The New Testament in the Greeke is so little, that by one houre in the morning and evening in one weeke (saith <hi>Broughton</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">Explicat. of the Apocal.</note>) one may with ease and great delight read it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, yet this booke (saith hee) hath above 4600. words.

               <hi>Pasor</hi> inlargeth the number; He saith the Appellative words are 4168. The proper names 474. The whole 5242. Hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ckons up seven Dialects of the New Testament. Neither is it strange (saith he) that the footsteps of all dialects are to be found there, since the Apostles published the Gospel, not one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Jewes, which used the Septuagint or Greeke version of the Old Testament, but also to other people differing in severall Dialects. The Attick Dialect, as it is the most elegant of all the rest in the Greeke, so it is most frequent in the New Testament. If Christians may by these Annotations (which have cost me a great deale of paines) be furthered in the study and knowledge of the Scriptures, I shall blesse God for it,<note place="margin">See my Anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations on <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.39.</note> and thinke my labour well bestowed. <hi>Austen</hi>

               <p>Secondly, The nature of Vipers is such, that when they have bitten a man, they presently run to the water, but if they find not the water they die: so Hee calls them Vipers who committing deadly sinnes did run to baptisme, as Vipers to the water to avoyde the danger of death.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, it is the nature of Vipers to make themselves a passage through their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers bowels, (though some denie this) and therefore they are called <hi>Viperae, quasi vi partae</hi>; so the Jewes daily persecuting the Prophets did breake through their mother the Synagogue, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.6.</p>

                  <hi>Verse</hi> 1. THe purpose of the Evangelists in this history, was to shew, partly how malicious the Pharisees were, and partly how superstitiously they were addicted to outward rites of small importance, insomuch that they placed all their holiness in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 3. Christ defendeth the fact of his Disciples, and confuteth the cavill of the Pharisees by five arguments: 1. By <hi>Davids</hi> example, necessity freed him from fault, for the Priest which gave him leave to take the shew-bread is commended by the Holy Ghost; indeed it was not lawfull but for the Priest only to eate the bread, that is, by the common Law. The second Argument is in the fifth, because it is lawfull on the Sabbath daies to kill Sacrifices, to circumcise Infants, and to do all other things that pertaine to the worship of God; the works of godliness cannot be contrary one to another. <hi>The Law</hi>] That is the Books of <hi>Moses,</hi> which describe the Law, a Metonymie of the Subject. <hi>Broken by the Priests</hi>] An improper speech which Christ useth, that he may frame himself to the hearers. The third argument is in the seventh verse, Christ re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proveth the Pharisees because they considered not for what purpose the Ceremonies were commanded, nor to what end they did belong. <hi>Hos.</hi> 6.7. <hi>Mercie</hi>] That is,<note place="margin">Calvin.</note> all works of Charity, and under <hi>sacrifice</hi> is all the outward worship of the Law comprehended. The fourth reason is in vers. 8. Christ saith here that he hath power given him to set his people free from the necessity of observing the Sabbath, the Son of man (saith he) can of his own power moderate the observing of the Sabbath, as he doth the other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies of the Law. The fifth argument is reported by <hi>Marke</hi> only, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7.27. The summe of it is, they do wickedly which turne the Sabbath to mans destruction, which God instituted for his sake.</p>
               <p>

And it is likely that he had healed some others on the Sabbath before, having therefore taken occasion of that, they demand of him, whether he think it lawfull for him to do again that he had done before, but God who instituted the Sabbath, laid not a Law upon himself, they should have considered
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:64320:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>
whether it had been the work of God or man to heale a dryed hand only by touching it, or with a word.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 11.

Secondly, as seed hath in it selfe a virtue of growing, of bearing fruit, and of procreating that which is like unto it; so the word of God hath in it a spirituall and quickning force of regenerating men. Thirdly, as the seed doth not quicken being kept in the garner, but being cast on the earth; so unles the word of God be spread abroad into the eares and minds of men, it doth not regenerate men, nor bring forth the fruits of faith.

               <p>To deny is either when we contradict what is affirmed and affirme the contrary, or else when we refuse to grant ones request, and neglect or oppose it. The first is Logical, in our words, the other morall, in our actions.</p>

               <p>There are two arguments used to set these three on, in <hi>Ver.</hi> 25, 26, 27.</p>

Secondly, It is alwaies true in respect of eternall life, they lose a better life than they save; <hi>and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it</hi>] That is, lose temporall life, as men count it, shall find eternall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ver.</hi> 26. <hi>For what is a man profited, if he shall gaine the whole world</hi>] The earth and all the things there that men can value and desire may be possessed without possessing God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And lose his own soule</hi>] Not in regard of being or property, but felicity.</p>

Of Adjuncts, the whole world, and his soule, 2. <hi>Ab impossibili,</hi> from the impossibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of recovering this soule and redeeming it if it should be lost.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>What shall a man give</hi>] That is, there is nothing he can give.<note place="margin">

               </p>

So they thought that their cups would be prophane unlesse they were first washed, for it might come to passe that a dead flie might defile them; if any one rose from the bed not besprinkled with water, they thought him prophane, since it might happen that a flea was killed in it, from which he might be defiled.

                  <hi>There be some of them stand here here, which shall not taste of death, till they have seene the kingdome of God come with power</hi>] That which some feigne of <hi>Iohn</hi> is ridiculous, <hi>Iohn</hi>

               <p>Very many, and those most rightly, understand these words of the following glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous transformation, and transfiguration of Christ on the Mount:<note place="margin">Polyc.

                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 2. <hi>And after sixe dayes</hi>] <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> number sixe dayes, <hi>Luke</hi> eight dayes. <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Marke</hi> reckon the sixe whole daies which flowed between, <hi>Luke</hi> comprehends as well that day in which Christ spake,<note place="margin">Calvin.

That is, in the seventh day Christ tooke to himself <hi>Peter, James,</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> being withdrawn from the company of the Apostles, and on the eighth day being accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with them, he ascended into the Mountaine, prayed, and was transfigured be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 6. <hi>They were sore afraid</hi>] This Greeke word is used of such a feare which makes one withdraw himself from the presence of another, of whose company he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth himselfe unworthy, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 9.19. It is used, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.21. of the terrible vision which God shewed upon mount <hi>Sinai.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 12. <hi>Elias verily commeth first and restoreth all things</hi>] That is, all things which according to the prophecie of <hi>Malachy</hi> he was to restore, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.5, 6. By <hi>Elias</hi> in <hi>Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy</hi> is understood <hi>John</hi> Baptist, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.14.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 13. <hi>But I say unto you, that Elias is indeed come</hi>] The Jews beleeved that <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> was to be sent before the Messiah began his kingdom; Christ confesseth that to be true, and saith, he was already come.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 18. <hi>Teareth him</hi>] The Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> signifieth to teare and rent as the dog doth. This tearing (saith <hi>Beza</hi>) is to be referred to the inward griefe of the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, because the Spirit invading him (as it happens in the Cholick) he was troubled as much as if he had indeed perceived his bowels to be torne asunder.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 24. <hi>I beleeve, help thou mine unbeliefe</hi>] There is faith and unbelife in the soule, at one time, in one action, upon one subject. Mr. <hi>Perkins.</hi>

                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Using the present tense, he signifies that the thing shall be shortly, for Christ did so hasten to death, and so se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously think of it, that it might seeme present to him, which was to come. <hi>Novarinus. Epiphanius</hi> saith, Christ called himselfe the Son of man, that he might shew that he is that Person which the Prophets foretold should take the nature of man, and amongst them <hi>Daniel</hi> by name calls him the Son of man.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 37. <hi>Whosoever shall receive one of such children in my name</hi>] Christ respects the childish quality, not the individuum. <hi>Polyc. Lyser.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 43. <hi>The fire that shall never be quenched</hi>] O that word <hi>never</hi> (said a poore despai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring creature on his death bed) breakes my heart.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 44. <hi>Esay</hi> 66. <hi>ult. Marke</hi> addeth thrice, <hi>Where the worme dyeth not,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Wormes and fire use to make an end of other things.</note> 
                  <hi>and the fire is not quenched.</hi> By which words metaphorically the twofold punishment in hell, one of the body, another of the soule is thought to be noted, saith <hi>Polycarpus Lyserus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By the worme is declared the continuall remorse of conscience, and the dayly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation of the sins committed: By fire, a sensible punishment, and most exquisite torments in the body. So <hi>Lyserus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Rather by these two is meant the <hi>poena sensus</hi> in hell, the privation of all good is commonly called <hi>poena damni,</hi> the punishment of losse, this is one part of hell torments, The everlasting absence of all good from God or the Creatures. The second part is a presence of all evill, comprehended here under the worme that dyeth not, and the fire that is not quenched. The worme is the Spirit of God by the coactive power of the Law holding a mans sins before his eyes, filling him with self convictions, and perfect feare and despaire for ever; the furious reflection of the soule upon it self for all its neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected opportunities, and the irrecoverable misery it is in. The fire is the wrath of the great God, let in upon the whole soule to eternity, but especially on the conscience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. <hi>ult.</hi> The fire is the essentiall part, the worme but the accidentall.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 49. <hi>Every one shall be salted with fire</hi>] In the Old Testament the force and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the Holy Ghost is compared to fire,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> Cappelli Spicilegium. <hi>Notu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> illud quod ex Cleanthe Varro dixit</hi>: animam suillo pecori pro sale datam ne putisceret: <hi>Et hujus rei causa salem in sacris Hebraeorum usitatum notavit doctissimus Abarbaniel.

                  <hi>Esay</hi> 6.6, 7. and 4.4. to which there seemes to be an allusion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. So here to be salted with fire, as by the force and efficacy of the Holy Ghost, he is preserved from the corruption of this world, and by sanctity of life he is sweet and pleasing unto God.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 14. <hi>Suffer the little children to come unto me</hi>] Not such as were like to children, for he took them up into his armes.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For of such is the kingdome of God</hi>] He meanes not the kingdom of glory, but the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Church of God, it is constituted of such; no child by nature is a Church mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, but by vertue of the Covenant made with his Parents. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 2.12.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 18. <hi>There is no man good but one, that is God</hi>] That is, simply, absolutely, essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially, and of himselfe such. Christ neither denies himself to be God, nor to be good, yet he received not the epithete of <hi>good</hi> from this man; as if he should say, because thou thinkest me to be a meere man, thou oughtest deservedly to abstaine from calling me <hi>good,</hi> since God only is to be called <hi>good,</hi> and if there be any <hi>good</hi> found with men they receive it from God alone.</p>

               <p>There are many reasons given why Christ speakes so often in similitudes, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the people of the East were accustomed of old, to propound their doctrine under such representations, as we see in many passages of the Old Testament, or because the divine oracles had foretold that the Messiah should open his mouth in Parables, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause supernaturall objects insinuate themselves more easily into the Spirit and make more lively impressions there, being conveighed by those things which are obvious to the senses.</p>

The more may we wonder why Christians should have their sacred meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in those places in which those carkasses are, which was first brought in for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of the Martyrs, but not so well continued.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 13. <hi>And when the Lord saw her, he had Compassion on her, and said unto her, weepe not</hi>] He really shewed the efficacy of comfort, restoring the raised Son to his mother. He useth two instruments,<note place="margin">Chemnit.</note> as it were, in the raising up of this dead person, for he touched the Biere, and spake to the dead; 1. That he might shew that the destruction of death, and restitution of life, is the power and work of his person, not in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine nature only, but in that also which he assuming from us, enriched with the fulness of the divinity. 2. That he might teach, that the meane, or instrument, by which those benefits of Christ are communicated to us,<note place="margin">

This is the first raising of the dead made by Christ in the New Testament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 14. <hi>Young man, I say unto thee, arise,</hi> or <hi>be raised from the dead</hi>] Jesus (when those that carryed the young man stood still) cried to the dead man, not in words of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, (as <hi>Elijah</hi> and <hi>Elisha</hi> did) but in the word of commanding. For so is the word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 16. <hi>And there came a feare on all</hi>] The common people amongst them which beleeved not in Christ could not so lightly neglect or calumniate this miracle as the rest for the unusuall greatnesse of it, for in nine hundred yeares almost after <hi>Elisha</hi> we read of no such thing to have happened in Israel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And they glorified God</hi>] Because they declared that this miracle was a testimony and warning that God either sent some famous Prophet, or the Messias himself.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A great Prophet is risen up</hi>] All those which were sent by God were called Prophets. They call him a great Prophet,<note place="margin">Grotius.</note> because he restored the dead to life, not by prayers, nor by the spreading of his body upon him, but by a bare command, without all example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 22. <hi>To the poore the Gospell is preached</hi>] Some translations (as the Geneva) have it,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Vulg Lat.</hi> pauperes Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelizantur.</note> 
                  <hi>The poore receive the Gospell</hi>: Which is more proper. <hi>The poore are Evangelized</hi> or <hi>Gospellized,</hi> so is the Greeke, as we say, one is Frenchified, or Italianated, when his Garbe and carriage are such as if he were a naturall Frenchman, or Italian, so their speeches or Iudgements, actions and affections are transformed into the Gospell.</p>
               <p>Christ speakes this in a twofold reference: 1. To the freeness of his love, he hath no respect of persons. 2. In reference to the effect, the poore receive the Gospell, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:64320:60"/>
a tincture or impression of the Gospell, are transformed into it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Poore</hi>) These words are absolutely true of the spiritually poore or humble: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he was made so by the Gospell. 2. Was bred by it, therefore is nourished by it; yet 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. they are intended by Christ of the outwardly poore, because he bids them tell what they had heard and seene, they could not see the spiritually poore. 2<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. All the rest of the things which they were to tell <hi>Iohn</hi> of were temporall, bodily blindnesse, lamenesse, death, therefore this. 3. Christ speakes of miracles, for a gracious man to receive the Gospell is no miracle. 4. This exposition agrees with other places, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 6.26. and 7.98.</p>
               <p n="3">3<hi rend="sup">ly</hi>. This is not true of them universally, nor exclusively, not all the outwardly poore, nor only they, receive the Gospell; but fourthly probably and for the most part the poore rather than the rich embrace it, and more eminently receive it; 1. Into their understandings to know it. 2. Into their judgements to allow of it as true. 3. Into their wills to consent unto the goodnesse of it. 4. To obey the truth of it in their lives.</p>

There are three great things observable in this historie. 1. Great sinnes.<note place="margin">Mr. <hi>Burgesse</hi> of Justificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> 2. Great repentance and humiliation. 3. Great love and grace of God through Christ in pardoning sinne.</p>

At this feast Jesus went up to Jerusalem, as also to other Feasts often in the time of his ministery. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> gives three reasons of it.

Secondly, lest he should seeme to be an Adversary of the Law, as if he had come to have broken it, but that he might shew that he would fulfill the shadowes and figures of him.

               <p>IT is a parable from oeconomy, and husbandmens sheepfolds. Secondly, since Christ compares the Church to a sheepfold into which God gathers all his, he compares himselfe to a dore since there is no entrance into the Church but by him.</p>
               <p>By this parable our Saviour first convinceth the Pharisees that they are false teachers, for they were not taught of their heavenly housholder, neither let in by the dore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper at the dore, but of their own accord crept into Gods sheepfold. The order of the Pharisees neither was instituted by God, nor brought in by the Prophets, but feigned
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:64320:88" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by men, and they entred themselves into the sheepfold of God. Therefore they had no care of the sheep, neither did they feed them with the doctrine of Gods word, neither went before them by an honest example of life, but fatted themselves, suffering the people of God to wander into any errours. Secondly, Christ by this parable gives a reason also why many of the people leaving the Pharisees followed him and his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. <hi>Viz.</hi> They were wandring sheep, and heard that Christ in the word of God propounded the true doctrine of salvation.</p>

First, he enters in at the dore, that is, hath a lawfull calling, <hi>non prece vel precio,</hi> much lesse by force is he obtruded on the hearers. Secondly, the dore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper opens to him, by whom we understand the Holy Ghost. Thirdly, being let in into the sheepfold, he is not mute toward the sheep, but calls them, and that by name, that is, he studies to know the dispositions and manners of all his hearers, that he may afterward know according to the diversity of their tempers to speak to them, admonish and handle them. Fourthly, leads them out of a dark dungeon of the world into the light of heavenly doctrine, from the love of earthly things to the hope and desire of heavenly. Fifthly, he goes before them with his voice,<note place="margin">Polyc. Lyser.</note> and also with his example invites them that they may follow him to the lively food of the word of God.</p>
               <p>To which may be added this sixth out of the following explication of the parable, that a good Shepheard seeks not his owne profit from the sheep, but the good of the sheep, and so seeks it, that he is also ready to give his life for them.</p>
               <p>These things are to be considered in this parable. First, the Shepheard Christ,<note place="margin">Ille pastor ille bonus <hi>sc. per excellentiam, hoc est, praecla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, optimus &amp; praestantissimus, imò unicus &amp; singularis ille princeps pasto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> Cornel. à Lap.

He proves this first from his fidelity, he defends his sheep, layes down his life for them. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, he feeds his sheep, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. The pastures of the sheep are the doctrine of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. To goe in and out in the Hebrew phrase signifies to doe prosperously in all the actions of his life, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.6. to conclude, Christ so feeds his sheep that they have life, and have it more abundantly, they have life entring into the Church, and have it more abundantly going out of this world to eternall life. <hi>Austen.</hi> Secondly, from his care for his sheep, therefore he saith 14. <hi>ver. he knoweth his sheep,</hi> the word <hi>know</hi> signifies not a bare knowledge, but also comprehends a diligent care and custody, notes not only the affection but the effect, as 15. <hi>ver. the Father knoweth the Son,</hi> that is, acknowledgeth him for his naturall Sonne, embraceth him, loves him, and intimately cares and approves of all things that belong to him. <hi>I lay down my life</hi>] That is, being crucified he expires his soule, and is buried; also the Sonne knowes the Father, he acknowledgeth that he hath all things and hath received them from him, and he is dear to him, and honours him though all the world persecuted him. Thirdly, from his diligence, whereby he increaseth his sheepfold; he speaks properly of the calling of the Gentiles, which then were as yet strangers,<note place="margin">

This may also be applyed to the sheep wandring from the Shepheard, Christ is very diligent in reducing these, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.4. Secondly, Christ compares his followers to sheep, 1. They easily wander from the Shepheard and the flock, and having once gone astray depart aside more and more. 2. They have exactly known their shepheard. Thirdly, they love the voice of their Shepheard, and willingly hear it, especially when they ought to be led to pastures and fountaines. Fourthly, they follow the Shepheard when he goes before them.</p>

                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 5. <hi>I wist not brethren that he was the high Priest</hi>] Some say he doth as much as confesse his fault, by excusing it with the plea of ignorance, alleaging that place of Scripture, which might give them to understand, that he was better seen in the Law, then that he would have so spoken, if he had known the quality of the person to whom he spake.</p>
               <p>Others say his meaning was, that he did not regard or consider him as the high Priest: others that he did not account him worthy to be the high Priest: others, that he plainely meant he did not know him to be the high Priest, for it was possible hee might mistake. He acknowledged him not, but knew him rather to be an usurper, which made him use that boldnesse. Mr. <hi>Perkins.</hi> His meaning was (saith <hi>Grotius</hi>) that he is not the High Priest, or chiefe of the Senate, who purchased such a dignity; for <hi>Paul</hi> (saith he) had learned this of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> that a Judge who shall give money for obtaining of a place of honour, is neither indeed a Judge, nor to be honoured; but, to be esteemed an asse; <hi>Calvin</hi> saith it is an ironicall speech, and that the meaning is, <hi>ego, fratres, in hoc homine nihil agnoseo Sacerdotale.</hi> Brethren I acknowledge nothing belonging to a High Priest in this man.

The excommunicate person is to have his conscience terrified by being delivered unto Satan, that is, cast out of the Church out of which Satan ruleth. 2. Sorrow must be wrought in him for his sin, for the destruction of his flesh, and fleshly corruption, which is the ground of true repentance. Neither is it any thing else then excommunication, which the Apostle signifieth by delivering to Satan, saving that he expresseth an extraordinary effect that followed in the Apostles time, <hi>viz.</hi> that those which were put out of the Church, became visibly subject to Satan, inflicting plagues and diseases on their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which might reduce them to repentance; which the Apostle calleth <hi>the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Iesus,</hi> as 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.20.

But yet it will not sowre the congregation; so as that all their worship and service shall be cast off by God as an abomination, that is the false glosse of some. For when the Gospell is compared to leaven, the holy Ghost meanes not that if the Gospell enter into any place, then the services of the whole congregation are made pleasing to God (for the services of hypocrites which are many never please him) but that the Gospell comming into a place, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting some one or two will goe farther, and convert more and more, till it draw the whole place at least to outward submission. The meaning is, one sinner tolerated and winked at doth infect another, till the whole society be over growne with the like wickednesse; and not that one sinner causeth the service of all those with whom it is done to become uncleane or polluted.</p>

                     <hi>Omnes Epistolae</hi> Pauli <hi>egregiae sunt: sed omniu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> imprimus quae Româ ex vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis missae sunt. Harum primam temporis ordine arbitror fuisse illam ad</hi> Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monem; <hi>Nam tunc adhuc cum ipso erat Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phroditus qui &amp; Epaphras: alteram ad Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippenses, ubi Epaphroditum remittit ad E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesios; &amp; eodem prope tempore hanc ad Colossenses, cùm adhue quae ad Ephesios scripserat, in animo haererent: postrema verò omnium ea quae posterior est ad</hi> Timotheum. Grotius.</note> that after they of the Church had been converted by <hi>Epaphras</hi> to the faith of Christ, and instructed in the truth of Religion, according to the doctrine of the Apostles, they were in danger to be seduced by false Teachers, raised up by Satan, who sought to impose and thrust upon them the observation of circumcision, and certaine rites of the ceremoniall Law, abolished by Christ, and to entangle them with many philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sophicall speculations; and to bring in the worship of Angels, and many other sorts of will worship devised by themselves. The Apostle hearing of this eminent danger like to fall upon them, was induced to write this Epistle unto them, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy against these evils. The summe and substance of this Epistle is, that the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lossians ought to continue constant in the doctrine of the faith delivered unto them by <hi>Epaphras</hi>; and to avoyd the corruption of flattering novelties and deceivers. The materiall parts of it besides the Proem and conclusion, are two. The first is concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Christian doctrine, in the two first Chapters; the second concerning Christian life and conversation in the two Chapters following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 9. <hi>That you might be fulfilled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdome and spirituall understanding</hi>] The words are better translated by <hi>Tremelius</hi> and <hi>Calvin; wisdome and prudence.</hi> To see truths and the reason of them, this is wisdome;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad sapientiam pertinet uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versalis myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riorum specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio, ad pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam mysteriorum cognitorum ad actiones applicatio.</hi> Estius.</note> to be cunning in practise, that is prudence. <hi>Ephes.</hi> 1.8. <hi>in wisdome and prudence.</hi> The oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site to wisdome is folly, the opposite to prudence is blockishnesse in a mans whole course.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 10. <hi>That ye might walk worthy of the Lord</hi>] Walking is an ordinary metaphor in the Scripture for the conversation of Christians, commonly used for the outward conversation, here for outward and inward too; because worthy and well pleasing is added.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Worthy</hi>] is taken in a legall and strict sense;<note place="margin">

                  <hi>Of the Lord</hi>] The word <hi>God</hi> alone ordinarily signifies the Father, the word <hi>Lord</hi> alone usually Christ; behave your selves answerably to his wisdome, authority, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, example.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Unto all pleasing</hi>] Not in one thing onely, but that whatever we doe may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable

               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 13. <hi>Who hath delivered us</hi>] The word signifies by fine force to deliver or pluck away, even as <hi>David</hi> pulled the Lambe out of the Beares mouth. It signifies such a deliverance as (in respect of them that are delivered) is never deserved by them, nor desired of them; but is (as it were) a drawing and haling, as the pulling of a beast, or rather a dead wight out of a pit: And in respect of the deliverer it signifies such a deliverante as is wrought by his Almighty power, by the power of his Spirit. <hi>Elton.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Vers.</hi> 15. <hi>Who is the Image of the invisible God</hi>] Christ is called so because of his equality every way, and likenesse to his Father; by him God, otherwise invisible, is manifested to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The first-born of every creature</hi>] The first-borne is used two waies; 1. Properly for him that was born before all others like to himselfe; so Christ is not the first-born, so he should be a creature. 2. Improperly, for him who is Lord and heire of all his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers goods; so here the first-born of every creature is the Lord of all creatures.</p>

               </p>
               <p>There are divers opinions about these strangers, the most common and true opinion is (saith <hi>Pareus</hi>) that <hi>Peter</hi> wrote this Epistle to the converted Jewes scattered through the provinces in <hi>Asia,</hi> which is very evident (saith Hee) from the first History of Pentecost described in the second of the <hi>Acts,</hi> for then the Jews came out of divers provinces, <hi>viz. Cappadocia, Pontus</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> to Jerusalem to the Feast. This Epistle was by <hi>Peter</hi> written to these Jews made Christians, and returned into their provinces, and there much afflicted for the Gospell.</p>
               <p>The purpose of the Apostle in this Epistle is to confirme the Christians, to whom he writes, in the faith, and to assure them, that it was the true grace of God they had received, and to perswade them to all possible care of sincerity of life becomming the Gospell, and to constancy in triall.

               <p>The Argument of this Epistle agrees with those things which <hi>Peter</hi> hath in his second Epistle, especially in his second Chapter and beginning of the third. <hi>Pareus</hi> saith it is an epitome of that second Chapter of <hi>Peter,</hi> and paralels divers verses in his Epistle and that Chapter.</p>

Secondly, others understand it literally, that then shall be a corporall resurrection of all the Martyrs to live with Christ a 1000. yeares. First, it cannot be a reigning with Christ in heaven, because it is something peculiar to those that are beheaded, a resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection which followes that, they rise from sin before they dye, besides the 9. and 10. verses shew it cannot be meant of heaven.
