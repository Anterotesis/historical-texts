            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>THE first Head</hi> will be to describe a Distraction. <hi>A Distraction is a secret wandring of the Heart from God, in some Duty in hand.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>It is a wandring,</hi> As the remisness of our Devotion shoots short, so Distraction shoots awry. 'Tis said, Prov. 27.8. <hi>As a bird that wandereth from his nest, so is a man from his place.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">

Epist. 2.</note> Its commonly known, the ready way to destroy the young in the shell, is discontinuance of heat; and to wander from our heavenly work, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces the dead off-spring of unprofitable Duties. It would be almost as easie to trace and follow the Bird in her vagaries, as the volatile and intricate imaginations of the heart <note n="::" place="margin">The same word <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies the Soul, and a Butterfly, because our wandring imaginations make our wavering spirits like wagling Butterflies puffed up and down with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry blast of vanity. Mr. <hi>Pagets Primmer.</hi>
                  </note> It is a digression: you that are curious to observe the Minister in
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:97523:13"/>
his digressions; how much more necessary is it to observe your own?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is secret,</hi> in the Heart. And this contracts the guilt and nature of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie upon a Distraction; for we have a short and clear description of hypocrisie, which agrees too well with distractions. Matth, 15.7, 8. <hi>This People draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips: but their heart is far from me.</hi> To have a bended knee, a craving eye, are choice <hi>Expressions</hi> of Duty: but without the <hi>Impressions</hi> and attendance of the heart, <note n="*" place="margin">In the Sacrifices of the Law, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards still were offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to God, the skin was for the Priest.</note> are double iniquity and flat hypocrisie. How empty would our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations be sometimes, if no more bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were present, than there are souls: And what abundance of sorry service hath our God, that no body sees?</p>
               <p>Yet how unknown soever these triflings of the mind are to others, or to our selves, yet are they most palpable to the Lord, who sets our most <hi>secret sins in the clearest light of his Countenance</hi>;<note place="margin">Psal. 90.8.</note> and though these <hi>primo-primi motus</hi> may antevert the use of Reason, and therefore seem small Pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dillo's yet they fall under the rebuke of Religion; and are as sinfull as they are secret: Good in secret is the best Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness;
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:97523:14"/>
and secret sinfulness, the worst sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This wandering of the Heart <hi>is from God,</hi> for God is the Object of Worship. To pray aright is, Zech. 8.21. <hi>To pray before the Lord.</hi> To give thanks aright is, Dan. 6.10. <hi>To give thanks before his God,</hi> not in his sight only, for so you are, when your hearts are worst; but they did look on God when they spake to him, as we do look on men, when we speak to them. <hi>Melancthon</hi> sayes, he hath heard <hi>Luther</hi> in his secret prayers so pray, that one would verily think, there were some body in the room with him to whom he spake.</p>
               <p n="4">4. This wandring is, while some Duty is in hand, to desert Duty is <hi>Nihil agere,</hi> to do divine duties to Diabolical ends is <hi>Male agere,</hi> to divert the Soul is <hi>Aliud agere. Hoc age</hi> must be the Christians motto, in the Worship of God. That was a good answer, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6.3. of <hi>Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> to his false friends, <hi>I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down, Why should the work cease while I leave it and come down to you?</hi> He that is in a Duty to God, is about a very great work, And that work stands, or goes backward every moment the heart is away;

               <p n="1">1. <hi>Many of our Distractions may justly be fathered on the Devil.</hi> He is a spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al substance, and is most properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versant in spiritual sins; He is compleatly skild in all thoughts whatsoever, and therefore what he imparts here, is of his own. Zech. 3.1. <hi>The High-Priest</hi> Joshua could not be at his Prayers for the Israel of God, but as Christ the Angel of the Covenant was on one hand, <hi>Satan was standing on the other,</hi> and he was got at the <note n="*" place="margin">Eccles. 10.2. <hi>A wise mans heart is at his right hand.</hi> i. e.

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:97523:15"/>
                  <hi>dextrously</hi> in his Devotion. When we are most serious before the Angel, The Devil is whispering at our Elbow, and who can be dull and watchless, when God is on one hand, and Satan on the other?</p>
               <p>The Devil is afraid of a serious lively prayer at his heart; he knows, That can pull down in a minute, what he hath been contriving a thousand years; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if he cannot withhold us from holy Duties, he will do his utmost to disturb us in them. Hence the vision of that <hi>Holy man</hi> who in the whole market saw but one De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil busie, (for there Self was at hand, Satan had no need to bestir him) but in the <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:97523:16"/>2. <hi>Our Distractions proceed from the mind and understanding.</hi> The <hi>Vanity of the mind alienates us from the life of God,</hi> and from communion with him. When a present and seasonable petition or instruction is conveyed through the ear into the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, It wantonly playes therewith, and taks occasion to run out on some con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguous notion, and from that to another, and at length rests and dwells on some ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en and unseasonable point, till the gales of the good Spirit, and the present Matter be overpast. And thus by a default in the <hi>understanding we seek not God,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 53.2.</note> nor find him as we might; And that excellent faculty, that would penetrate into the Divine Mysteries, and should guide the will and heart unto God, by the <hi>Ignis fatuus</hi> of its unmortified Vanity, misleads us from the chief Good, and intangles us in distracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. We read 2 Cor. 7.1. <hi>Of a filthiness of the Spirit,</hi> whereof surely this is a part, and must be cleansed in them, that will <hi>perfect holiness in the fear of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Some Distractions proceed from the Fancy,</hi> a most busie faculty, that's most unruly and least sanctified in an Holy man. <hi>Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times</hi> by the help of memory, stepping back into things past, she brings into the most

                  <hi>wandring of the Desire</hi>; there is something more of evil in these second contemplations, than in the first Commissions. <hi>Sometimes</hi> the Fancy will create a world of figments and notions out of nothing, and multiply im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent thoughts upon no ground and to no purpose; and can sally out of the present matter to every adjacent business, and make a great ado to bring nothing to pass. Job 27.8. <hi>There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the Vultures eye hath not seen,</hi> the fancy can find out such a way; thus God is not in all (hardly in any of) our thoughts, when we pretend to treat him with the greatest solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:97523:17"/>And <hi>sometimes</hi> the Fancy breeds Distra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions by fore-casting things to come <note n="(b)" place="margin">Thus <hi>Praeceden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia peccata sunt se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentium causa, se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quentia sunt praece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentium poena.</hi> Aug.</note>: So many a man can most easily, on the Sabbath, contrive his business for all the Week after; and the poor woman in the corner of a Prayer order the business of all the house for a day.

This indeed is a sad disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for a Noble Soul to embrace the Dunghil instead of the Sun of Righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; for a man to lose those sweet words and minutes which might be had with God; it is a sad mischance indeed, but which is common with man, wherein if the Soul cry out as the forced Virgin, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.27. it shall not be imputed to her, espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when there was neither previous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, nor subsequent consent. And this is the case of blasphemous thoughts, which are like Lightning cast into a Room, which carries horrour, but springs from no cause thereof in the Room: So these thoughts come in upon thee, amaze and terrifie, surprize thee against thy will: But be of good Comfort; neither leave off thy Duties, (thy Prayers will do thee

more good, than these can do thee harm) nor hasten from them to gratifie Satan; for if God be not able to protect thee in the discharge of thy duty, it's time to think of another Master; but complain of Satan to God, parly not with them, but divert thy thoughts, and cry up that God the more, whom he tempts thee to blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme.</p>
               <p>But others are <hi>willing</hi> Distractions, which are the ordinary effect of an unspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and unprepared Heart: To such an Heart the whole Duty is a Distraction: When a vain and earthly Soul like a truant Scholar, keeps out of his Masters sight out of choice, and with content, and is any where better than at his Lesson: What lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Rest would such a <hi>Soul</hi> find in <hi>Heaven?</hi> Or what true delight can he take in the most holy presence of God above, that can find no rest and sweetness in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence below?</p>

So though we cannot well hinder the sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den suggestion of a vain thought, yet we may trouble its quiet resting in the Soul. Yet such strange subtilty is there in us, that we can keep God in play a long time (yea when our selves are employed in a Prayer) and be tampering with the world or sin all the while, the soul never coming in, till the <hi>Amen</hi> of a Prayer do awaken us <note n="*" place="margin">

From the <hi>Precept of God,</hi> The wise and merciful God commands nothing, but he finds or makes it possible; He most truly sayes, <hi>Viam aut inveniam aut faciam.</hi> His commands are not snares but Rules, yea and Helps. When a <hi>Master</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, power and assistance waite not on his Commands; the Servants strength must perform the Masters will: but here are the commands of <hi>a Father,</hi> which when they outstrip his childs strength, are still accompanied with his own assistance; and the chair which the weak cannot bring in, he helps to fetch himself. Now behold the Divine Precept, 1 Sam. 12.24. <hi>Serve him in Truth with all your Heart.</hi> What truth is there, while we appear to serve the Lord, and indeed do not think upon him at all! Or how is that with all the Heart, while there is not half, nor any thereof many times! while we can pray, and plot, and think, and look, and begin our Devotion only at the end of the Duty. Our merciful Father will not impose an impossible Law upon us. <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:97523:22"/>2. In regard of <hi>the Power of God</hi> it is possible. Ours is the Duty, but his is the strength. God and his servant can do any thing. When you look on a hard task, and your heart fails you, advance your eye of Faith, and you will find <hi>God</hi> the strength of your heart, Phil. 4.13. <hi>I can do all things through Christ that strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth me</hi>; loe here the omnipotency of a worm! If all things, (that is all my duty) then this among the rest. But you will say, This was an Apostle, a Person of great strength and Grace: yet still the <hi>Acts</hi> were from the man, but the <hi>Strength</hi> was from Christ; for the same person saith, 2 Cor. 3.5. <hi>Not that we are suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent of our selves to think any thing as of our selves, but our sufficiency is of God.</hi> Who though he be at the same time <hi>Terrible out of his holy places,</hi> and darts his Curses on them that do his work negligently, yet <hi>the God of Israel is he that giveth strength and power to his People, Blessed be God,</hi> Psal. 68.35. He gives, that is, he is ready to give it out, but alas his stock lyes almost dead by him; and none sues to him in good earnest.

As to this, some think that clause in our <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> Ezek. 11.19. of <hi>One Heart</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended this way; wherein the Lord promiseth an united heart to his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. An hypocrite hath more hearts than one, an heart for his pleasures, an heart for his pride, here and there his affections are stragling, now saith God I will give one heart. There is ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Promise, Jer. 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear into their hearts, that they shall not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from me</hi>; neither in whole nor in part, unless fault be in your selves. Now these promises are <hi>Amen in Christ,</hi> and do belong to every soul that is in Christ; who may claim and have the benefit of them.</p>

If every mans body were gone after his soul, this would sometimes be an empty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. Every solemn look hath not a serious heart, and there are but few that make a business of Prayer; And this is a lamentable thing, that we can hold a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course with man, or crave a kindness, or drive a bargain without a wandring thought: till our face be set towards God, and that we begin a duty of Worship, and then or ever we are aware, our Soul is slipt off her Chariot wheels, and our sight of God is lost.</p>

is no God, Psal.</hi> 14.1. Mark, it is not, He hath <hi>thought</hi> in his heart, but <hi>says</hi> it by rote to himself; rather as what he would have, than what he doth believe. And of him this is truly said, That the speculative A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theist is the greatest Monster in the world, except the Practical. And our late Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, by the help of our corrupt Natures, have proselyted a considerable number to this desperate Opinion: As if the different opinions about the ebb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng and slowing of the Sea, should render it doubtful whether the Sea did ebb and flow; or the disputes about the manner of Vision, should call our Sight it self into question: You would think it a fond conclusion to say, Because Philosophers argue much about the sensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and vegitative Faculties of the Soul, that there is no rational Soul at all, in that these very velitations and debates do argue a rational Soul, by and with which these points are disputed: even so it is notorious madness to conclude, from the variety and diversity of Opinions about Religion and Government, that there is no <hi>God</hi>; seeing you are supported by him, while you dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute and argue about him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Atheism of the Heart,</hi> is, whereby the Fool saith <hi>also in his Heart, There is no God</hi>;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:97523:42"/>
that is, either secretly questions, or but coldly assents to the existence of God, or heartily wishes there were none at all. And it is worth observation of both these, that they are such as are obnoxious to the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Majesty by some misdemeanor: The Felon wishes there were no Judge at all, and even these are forced in some pangs to acknowledge him, at some fright by thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, under some horrour of Consci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <hi>Atheism of the Life,</hi> that's described, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.14. <hi>They profess that they know God, but in works they deny him.</hi> Now both these latter do breed of the first, and this last is most visible in our Distractions: For if thou didst as verily believe God present in an Ordinance, as he that sits next thee, durst thou trifle so egregiously as thou dost? The Minister looks at you, and you dare not talk; if you saw him that looks at you from Heaven, you durst not straggle: And therefore the more or less strong our belief is of <hi>God,</hi> the more or less lively are we in our applications to him.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:97523:42"/>
Oh the patience of God! that he can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Worm to doubt of him, yea im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitely to deny him, and not demonstrate himself by a Thunderbolt! But the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey-man's ignorance of the <hi>Primum Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile,</hi> doth not nullifie it; no more doth the Athiests Infidelity degrade the <hi>Primus Motor,</hi> the Majesty of Heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>He that cometh unto God, must first believe that he is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Remedy of this Cause, is, <hi>Humbly to read the Scripture,</hi> which is the most clear, certain and convincing way to work Faith herein. <note n="*" place="margin">One in <hi>Gerson</hi> that studi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed against Atheism, and could not get the better of it, at last fell to Prayer, &amp; thereby grew as really per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of the truth of unseen things, as of the Chair he sat in.</note> Prayer and the Bible have convinc'd more than any other Reasons, &amp; recommend me to <hi>Moses</hi> above <hi>Plato,</hi> for the demonstrating a Deity. All that Reason can suggest, might be written by an Infidel; and more Infidels (I trow) have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by reading and hearing the Book of the Christians, than have Christians been settled by reading the Books of Infidels. And therefore although holy <hi>David,</hi> Psal. 19.1. appeals to the Heavens, and the Host of them, as a most strong Argument to declare God, and so it is; (for what reason but the <hi>hand of a God,</hi> can be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, that the <hi>Planets</hi> being all of one matter, should have contrary motions,

For though the heart be deceitful from the beginning to the end of the year, yet her prime and subtled sleights are shewed in the service of God; where she is put hard to it to shift hard for her self, and therefore useth her finest notions and sliest fetches to evade the presence of <hi>God,</hi>

This sweet wood cast into that bitter water, will by degrees render it more wholesome. The more sanctification, the more you will be mortified to the world, and all the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness and vanity thereof; and then its thoughts and cares will not rush in, with that violence upon you, but stay to speak with you at your better leisure; or if they be invading the heart, you will have more vigour of grace to expel them, and more repentance for them; you will be more lively, and spiritual, and fervent in Religious duties, and so less room for these wandrings; for he that's hot in his business, prevents the assault of the most importunate diversions; and a lively se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Christian runs on his errand, like <hi>Elisha</hi>'s Servant, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.29. <hi>If thou meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute thee, answer him not again</hi>; and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan cannot fasten discourse on such a man: yea, and generally, the more holy the heart is, the fewer of these wandring thoughts; forasmuch as sanctity being

his frame and element, heterogeneous by thoughts do put him out of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and so displease him, and cause some smart to the soul; and the sin that really molests a man, will hardly ever prevail over him; and finally, the more holiness you attain, the more afraid will you be to displease God.

Turn therefore those many thoughts you spend about the truth of your grace, into all possible care to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and increase it, so will you best clear your doubts, and in particular clear your distractions.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Q. <hi>What kind of Preparation is necessary before our ordinary duties of Worship?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 1. The light of nature teacheth us to prepare for every weighty action. Approaching to the Lord of Heaven and Earth is such. Who teaches the Client to consider his case, when he comes to state it to his Advocate? or the Husband-man to prepare himself for his tillage, or the poor suitor to weigh his request, that he makes to a Prince? Why, the light of nature teacheth this; and the light of Scripture distinguisheth an upright man from an hypocrite hereby. 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.3. <hi>There are good things in thee— in that
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:97523:48"/>
thou hast prepared thine heart to seek God</hi>: there was <hi>Iehoshaphat.</hi> Again, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.14. <hi>Rehoboam did evil, because he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared not his heart to seek the Lord.</hi> He sought God, its likely, as many will do, but he cared not how he did it, and so though he did a good thing, yet, saith the Scripture, <hi>He did evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. Most certainly the Lord is a <hi>great God,</hi> who can raise or ruine thee in a moment, and whom the Angels ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach not without a profound respect: and so likewise Duties of Worship are great and weighty Duties, wherein you transact for a Kingdom, and plead or hear the cause that is for life or death. You drink a cup that will either mend or end you, and who is sufficient for these things? And it is manifest, that we are naturally unprepared, and to every good work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probate. The positure of our hearts is inverted, and now they are open down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and shut towards Heaven; all which if you lay together, it must needs follow, that some preparation is necessary, even for the ordinary duties of God's Worship.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> 3. The hearts of men are of a different temper, and so are their occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions;
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:97523:48"/>
the hearts of some are always in heaven, or else within a Call: they are, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> speaks, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Ready to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good work.</hi> When a duty of Piety is of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, they are ready; when an object of charity is proposed, they are <hi>ready to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stribute.</hi> And this present Spirit is a great blessing, when Holiness is so rooted and framed upon the heart, that God's Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is their Element: the hearts of others, through custom and supine negligence, abide at great distance from God; no little ado will raise them, nor will they be fetch'd in with many calls; like a great Bell, hard to be raised: and as these have a greater unhappiness, so they have need of more pains to fit them for God's service. <note n="*" place="margin">In such case Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, like a dish of water, may set the Pump a going; yea, foul water may bring up fair water. B. <hi>Hall.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>The occasions of some men will give them time enough to set their hearts in order, to state their souls condition, and chafe themselves into an holy heat; and for them to come with cold and dead hearts into Religious duties, cannot be answered. The occasions of others are so urgent and continual, that they have much ado to redeem time, for Prayer, but can hardly set apart time for a set and formal Preparation; especially when a
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:97523:49"/>
man is surprised with an holy duty, or in prayer at meals, or the like: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore one Last may as soon fit all feet, as one particular Rule suit with every good Christian.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ</hi> 4. The least measure of Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration that is necessary for the ordinary worship of God, is, <hi>That the heart be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called, and recollected out of the world</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">

                     <p>If thou canst not always have sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt other occasions and God's worship, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note>, <hi>and made apprehensive or sensible of the Nature of that God, and weight of that work, that you are about</hi>; which, if you can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in a minute, or are of necessity strait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned or surprized, you will be welcome to Heaven: but if you can easily order your time, or not easily order your hearts, and remand your thoughts, you venture on your peril; and if God be not merciful, and you penitent, you will carry away a curse instead of a blessing. And so I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude this Answer with <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.28, 29. <hi>Let us have grace</hi> (not only a gracious ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, but a gracious frame) <hi>whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fear, for our God is a consuming fire.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Think it not much therefore, to keep or get an heart prepared for the Worship of God. When <hi>Ringers</hi> set not in toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, there's little but jangling in that

Even so the zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Soul, though he forgets not those things that are behind, yet reaching forth to the things that are before, presseth towards the mark, he hath business in hand that concerns Eternity, he cannot stand to whisper with every passenger, nor trifle with every object. It is the luke-warm heart that is prone to that. He can pray to God, and dress himself at once, he can hear God and talk with

men, speak about heaven and contrive about the earth, and, in a word, serve God and Mammon at a time. Good <hi>Iacob</hi> was little troubled with wandring thoughts, <hi>Hos.</hi> 12.3, 4. when he had <hi>by his strength power with God, yea, he had power over the Angel and prevailed, for he wept and made supplication.</hi> Tears are the best charms to chase away Distractions.

               <p>As there can be no reason given for any sin, (call'd therefore folly) so for this in special; for if the holy work you are about, be worth the consuming of your time, (which passes in every duty, and is most precious) sure it's worth the spending your pains and diligence. He that loseth his time in the duty, and loseth his soul by his luke-warmness in the duty, makes a mad man's match. For if the Sermon, Prayer, Chapter, be not worth thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, never attempt it; and if it be, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shrink, nor be indifferent about it. When you see a man freez at his work, it invites a passenger to entertain him with talk. And a frigid attender upon God tempts the Devil himself to tempt him. Wherefore the Apostle, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:97523:51"/>
directs us to be <hi>fervent in spirit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Where could a wandring thought get into that most zealous Prayer, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9 19?</note> while we <hi>are serving the Lord:</hi> not drowsie, but fervent in spirit, or <hi>boyling hot,</hi> as the word signifies. The busiest flies will not meddle with the scalding hony; though the sweetness entice them, yet the heat affrights them. The base flies of thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions will not molest thy heart, if it keep boyling hot in the service of God. A warm and weeping Prayer is the right Holy Water, that scares away the devil.</p>
               <p>Now the best remedy against this Luke-warmness is, 1. Consideration, and 2. Practice.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Consideration of the ineffectualness of a frozen duty, which seldom reacheth the Heart of God when it reacheth not our own <note n="*" place="margin">

That <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent</hi> only <hi>take it by force</hi>; that such duties neither please God, nor our selves, they mock God, and rather deceive than delight us. That some Prayer or Sermon must be thy last, and perhaps this present may be it. That it is an irrational thing, to bring a dead Sacrifice to a living God. That one seri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and lively duty does you more good, and leaves a more sweet, blessed and active frame upon the soul, than an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred

               <p n="2">2. Practice is the other remedy. To cure this luke-warmness in God's service, frequent those Lights that are burning as well as shining.

As long as the <hi>Lark</hi> soareth upward, she sings without danger of the Net; but stooping to gaze on the Foulers deceitful Glass, she is quickly ensnared.

Hence it comes to pass, that the heart is loth to come to an Ordinance, and then longs to goe out again: how heavily do they go to Church, how lightly to the market? for here the heart goes with them, and there it's left behind; and being forc'd into a duty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause its treasure is in the world, the heart hastens to be there again, and <hi>sicut piscis in arido,</hi> is out of its element when in an Ordinance <note n="*" place="margin">See a plain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance hereof in that hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.13, 14.</note>.</p>
               <p>We read of the <hi>world set in a mans heart, Eccles.</hi> 3.11. and of an <hi>heart set on the world, Ps.</hi> 62.10. Now how should God have any of such a heart?

The Prophet, <hi>Hosea</hi> 4.11. tells us, that <hi>whoredome, and wine, and new wine take away the heart.</hi> It

were very unlikely, that any man in the heat of those sins should pray, or hear, or meditate aright; and it is much what as likely, for an heart that is taken away with the cares of this world, and drowned therein, to converse with God, without innumerable wandrings <note n="*" place="margin">

Which shews, what good reason the wise man had to crave neither riches nor poverty, but convenient comforts, seeing the weight of the world distracts one sort, and the want of the world another sort in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry immediate service of God.

its object: as Faith is the bond of our <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical,</hi> so Love is the bond of our <hi>moral</hi> union with Christ.

The three Disciples, <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.4. had but an half-quarter glimpse of that state, but their love to their dearest Lord and his presence was so heightned, that the world was forgotten, <hi>Ierusalem</hi> below, and all their friends and fellow-Disciples forgotten, and they undone to abide there. And if we could by the eye of faith see him that is invisible, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly love him, O how hardly could we spare a by-thought in his presence and service! no, all the world would be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, comforts and crosses all sleep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, while God and our soul were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing in an Ordinance <note n="*" place="margin">

                  <pb n="97" facs="tcp:97523:57"/>Whence is it that most men can work and care perpetually, and no distractions divert them? discourse their business most orderly, without one alien thought? drive on a bargain an hour together, and think on nothing but what's pertinent to their present business? Why, they love what they are about, they like it well, and so tongue and heart go together, are wholely taken up therewith. The jovial knot like their company, and nothing shall distract them; the servant comes about necessary business; the master fumes that they will not let him alone; the child comes, and then the wife, but he frets, he rages. And why all this? why, he loves his company, 'tis his delight, his heaven: Even so, the Soul that hath a strong love to a precious Christ, and his Ordinance-presence, doth most heavily bear a distracting thought. The devil cannot pluck him from <hi>Christ,</hi> but the soul smarts, and when there is this smart at parting, that soul will part but seldom. You have sometimes seen a sucking child, that loves the mother and the breast most dearly; how loth is it to leave it, while it is hungry? how eagerly and angrily it seeks, and cries, and catches

He wakes, and travels, and cares, but his

And where the world, or sin, are a mans treasure, his heart is with them also; he reads, and hears, and prays, but his heart is away: the least noise, business or whis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per can fetch him away, alas, his love is cool, and a drop of water will quench a spark of fire <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:97523:59"/>
affect the heart. Come then, open the eye of Faith, and gaze on this heavenly object: sit down, and meditate who, and what he is; open but the sacred Cabinet of his Attributes, every box full of most sweet perfumes: each of his offices preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with true and transcendent comfort. His actions, his passion, his words, his works, and above all, his heart, as full of Heaven as ever it can hold, and full <hi>for thee</hi>: the breast full running into the open mouth of faith, the <hi>Fountain opened for thy sins and uncleanness.</hi> The treasures of his grace free for thy supplies, what heart can freez under such discoveries? Nay stay, and look at him on the cross calling thee, arms stretched out to embrace thee, heart opened to let thee in, and deny him thy love if thou can. And if once <note n="*" place="margin">He loves thee little, O Lord, who loves any thing with thee, which he loves not for thee. <hi>Nil preter te, nisi pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter te.</hi> Aug.</note> your hearts be inflamed with his love, no small businesses shall keep you from his presence, nor distract you in it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Get communion with Christ in his Ordinances. As he said on another occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, <hi>Ioh.</hi> 4.10. <hi>If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is— thou wouldest have asked, and he would have given thee living water.</hi> So I say, if thou knewest what communion is with Christ, thou wouldest
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:97523:59"/>
ask after prayer, and long for such op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities. Why, what is communion with Christ? Why, for thy spirit to flie up into heaven, among the celestial spirits, and for Christ's Spirit to descend into thy heart. And this makes an heaven upon earth, 'tis inexperience in this, that makes us cool to Christ and holy duties: strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness makes company burthensome. A King and a beggar, a scholar and a clown, cannot make company of one another. So when there is a distance between God and the soul, there is little longing for his Ordinance, nor true delight in it. Communion with Christ increases love, and love to him promotes communion. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.1. <hi>O that thou wert my brother,</hi> (saith the Spouse) <hi>the son of my mother,</hi> (there's ardent love) <hi>when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee,</hi> (there's communion) <hi>yet should I not be despised.</hi> If you did but see his power and glory <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Mouns. de Renty</hi> said of himself, that when ever he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd the name of God, he tasted such a sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness upon his lips, as could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. <hi>In vitâ.</hi>

heart, to see and feel the sweetest proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the infinite God displayed before, and graven on it? When <hi>Moses</hi> was in near communion with God on the Mount, no thinking of meat, no cares about his tents below, but there he is swallowed up, and is content to melt in that Sun of light and heat, and come down no more; easie to count his distractions in the Mount.

If you should lodge your <hi>noble friend,</hi> whom Love only moves to visit you, in the same room with a <hi>nasty beggar,</hi> may not he take it for a plain affront, and refuse to come near or help you in your need? even so the <hi>holy Ghost,</hi> your Noblest Friend will take it ill, to be pack't into a room with base and beggarly thoughts, and may justly deny that presence and assistance, which we have need of; and without Gods spirit helping us, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray as we ought, nor keep out Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stractions with all our skill. Rom. 8.26. <hi>The spirit helpeth our infirmities,</hi> and these wandrings are some of those infirmities, which the spirit must help us about, yea and will, if he be not disobliged, but it is far from likely, that we should have that sacred <hi>Spirit</hi> at our beck in Duty, whom we have distasted all the day long. How

justly may He say, as it is Jer. 11.15. <hi>What hath my beloved to do in my house?</hi> or, as the Margent, <hi>what is to my beloved in my house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many?</hi> As if he should say, I know not what to do with thee in my house, or what thou hast to do with me, having roved so extreamly with thy heart from me, and been lewd with many.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>These dispose and naturalize the soul to roving.</hi> Habit is a second nature <note n="*" place="margin">Hereby holy Thoughts become tedious and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, for we strive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst two natures, one that sin hath brought and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that Custome hath wrought.

Perhaps you have resolved against these vain wandrings in <hi>Gods</hi> ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but being us'd to them, they call at door, and take you captive away against
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:97523:70"/>
your intention. And therefore set up a constant watch against them, for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is link't together in the power and practicals of it. So that you must take all, or leave all; be a Christian allwayes and altogether, or not at all. It is said of that <hi>accursed Mahomet</hi> that he had used a <hi>Dove</hi> to come to his Ear, and thence to eat her commons, And so when the falling sickness surprized him, his pigeon presently came to her repast, which he feigned to be the <hi>holy Ghost</hi> or an <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,</hi> that told him the mysteries of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: my beloved, if these fowls, these evil Angels be used to your ear or heart, they will come even in your most coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial imployments, and divert and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract you: and hereby they become less strange, and things that are familiar to us, though ugly, are not started at; nay tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diligence will not dispel them, if you give them ordinary entertainment. If a way be made over your corn or ground, and people used to come that way, it must be an higher hedge than ordinary, that must keep them off. If vain thoughts have made a road over thy heart, and use to come that way without controll, it must be a very high and strong watch

and resistance, that will turn them by, in holy Duties. Prov. 35.28. <hi>He that hath no rule over his own spirit, is like a City that is broken down and without Walls.</hi>

                  <hi>The Remedy</hi> against these idle thoughts out of Duties is,</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A right understanding what a vain thought is.</hi> Though it sound somewhat harsh, that all thoughts are either good or bad, the matter of some being in itself indifferent; yet if we consider the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and Tendency of them, we shall hardly light upon one individual thought, but it hath either the stamp of Good or Evil upon it. It is certain, that a wicked mans thoughts are all vain, as
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:97523:73"/>
they come from him, neither flowing from a sanctified heart, nor being dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to a Divine end. Ah poor sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, your hearts are little worth, the imaginations of them are <hi>materially</hi> or <hi>formally</hi> or <hi>finally</hi> evil, only evil and that continually. The sweetest words from corrupt lungs do stink in the nostrills of them that stand by, and so your best thoughts coming from corrupt hearts, cannot be right in the sight of God.</p>
               <p>And then for a gracious man, it should seem every thought comes ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the old man or the New, the regenerate or unregenerate part, especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally if we consider that there is hardly a thought but it may be resolved ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately either into Christ or Self, Let it therefore be concluded, that every thought that is not suggested, or dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the Spirit of God, and that no way conduceth to the glory of God, the good of your neighbour, nor the good of your own soul or body, is a vain thought, vain or void, it might be spared, it stands for nothing, its worse than no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

               <p>How an heart may be said to be divided in a duty these waies:
<list>
                     <item>1. When all the heart is not ingaged therein; as when understanding or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science without the will or affections. This opens a door unto distractions, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Doing the Will of God from the heart, with good will doing service as to the Lord, and not to men.</hi> Half an heart can do nothing with God. A man may as well with one eye observe the stars, and with the other measure the Earth at the same time, as at once dispatch affairs with God and man.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:97523:76"/>
Hereby both businesses are spoiled: Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of God hinders from any discreet and serious contrivance of any thing in his presence; and tampering with the world, provokes God, and hinders the affairs above. Our Lord Christ is most peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory in that case: Ye cannot serve two Masters, the one will be over-served, <hi>ye cannot serve God and Mammon.</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. The heart may be said to be divided, when it is unfixed and indeterminate; wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering and unsetled. A duty to God is shooting at an hairs breadth; if a man be uncertain and unsteady, how shall he hit the mark? <hi>Psal.</hi> 57.7. <hi>O God, my heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed, I will sing and give praise.</hi> Now the work is likely to go on. You cannot (it seems) so much as sing a Psalm, or give the Lord praise without this fixedness of heart. As you have seen the <hi>Needle</hi> in a Compass, waver up and down perpetually, till it point to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the North, then it is fixed and standeth still: so until the soul be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed, and bent directly towards God, it wanders, and trifles everlastingly.</item>

                  <hi>an opinion that there is no great evil in them</hi>; which <hi>partly</hi> proceeds from that Notion, that thoughts are free, or at least, that no sin is really sin, except it be voluntary, and these are without consent; <hi>partly</hi> from our being used to greater sins, which do widen the conscience to digest these lesser ones, without any staying: And <hi>partly</hi> from the commonness of them, being the snares wherein we are most frequently ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and the oftener they walk thorow the heart, the less strange are they there; the more familiar they are, the more apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy we have for them; and so usually it becomes no sin, that we have a mind unto <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p n="1">1. Somewhat must <hi>be granted.</hi> The
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:97523:79"/>
evil in these wandring thoughts, is not so great, as in many other sins: these do not <hi>vastare conscientiam,</hi> lay the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science waste, as some others, especially these roving thoughts, as are rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, than contrived; the matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is good, not evil, and which are short and sorrowed for: But who will swallow a Spider, and say, there is not so much poyson in this as in a Toad; or break his legg, and say, there is not such danger therein, as in breaking the neck? even so, it is a poor plea to say, these <hi>peccadillo's,</hi> trivial things are not like oaths, and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and oppression, &amp;c. But these are great enough to displease God, to bind guilt upon the soul, to prepare for greater, and bid fair for Hell.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Something must <hi>be answered,</hi> as namely, 1. That though our thoughts are free from the notice of men on Earth, or Satan in Hell, further than they are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed in the body or actions; though they are free from the punishment of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws, yet are they not free from the eye, nor Law, nor wrath of God, as you heard in divers instances before, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the case of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> Act. 8.22. And 2. That other Notion
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:97523:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is corrupt, that nothing is culpable that is involuntary: It's true, this doth extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a fault, but this doth not extinguish it: 'tis a less fault in that ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> but it is a fault <note n="*" place="margin">Nay, in some re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects, the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary any sin is, the more strong and natural it is; and the more na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, the more hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible; as a natural thief is worse than a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate thief, who some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times steals: and in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary sins may be worst of all. <hi>Shepherd</hi> Select ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.</note>, for the understanding may be depraved, as well as the will; and we are really guilty in <hi>Adam</hi>'s sin, though we had no previous consent therein. It is a fault, that we are capable subjects for such sinful injections, though we yield not to them; for there is something in us that incourages those attempts: the Angels met with none of these.

For our accustomedness to greater sins, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency in those, that signifies little here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: for crimes do not excuse faults. The Stars are the same in the firmament all day, though while the Sun shines, they appear not; when the Sun is retired, they will shew themselves: while your greater staring sins appear, these are nothing; but if ever a night of terrour come upon you,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:97523:80"/>
then each of these will shine in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per guilt, in the eye of conscience. And then 4. The commonness of them adds to their sinfulness, though it take from your sense thereof. If your neighbour for a time break over your hedge, and tread your corn, the matter is soon put up, 'tis but a trespass by chance; but if he daily use it, and make it his way, you think it's intolerable: So if a wandring thought stole in once a week, it were a less offence; but if they will transgress, and make a way over <hi>God</hi>'s ground, spoil his Garden often in every day, this makes the sin the greater, though the sense of it be the less <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p n="3">3. Something must <hi>be advised</hi> for cure. And that is, 1.

<pb n="146" facs="tcp:97523:82"/>
There's the <hi>first Commandment</hi> broken. Do you worship him according to his will, that thus worship him? If material Images be cast off, and spiritual fornication com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, ye are still breakers of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. A graven Image in the mind, a worldly or wicked fancy there, where Christ should be, cannot but provoke him to be very angry. There's the <hi>second Commandment</hi> broken.

As if the wife should be speaking busily with her husband, and at the same time looking at the picture of the Paramour, what rage would this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in her husband's heart? To make the Name of God a cloak for the things, the nothings of the world, for the worst thing sin, is the saddest sacriledge; and for which he will not hold you guiltless, if he find you griefless. And then the <hi>fourth Commandment</hi> is broken by a plain rape, and theft committed of God's holy time; that which you <note n="*" place="margin">God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids us to find our pleasure on his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly day, Isa. 58.13.

Mr. <hi>Angier.</hi> p. 186.</note>. When we miss of God, we have small mind to his service again. It is the comparison of a learned Divine, when there is no marow in the bone, we quickly throw the bone away; even so when the sweet injoyment of God is not found in an Ordinance, which is lost by the roving heart, we shall ere long cast away that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, except shame or custom restrain us. Now when the soul cares not for prayer, or other Ordinances, it is a sad effect: the Lord may say to thee, with more right and reason, than <hi>Dalilah</hi> did, <hi>Iudg.</hi> 16.15. <hi>How canst thou say, I love thee, when thine heart is not with me?</hi> What love is that without an heart? where the affection is, there the cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will be also. I may truly invert this, and say, where the heart is not before, there love will not come after. Let all the soul be seriously bestowed in any duty of prayer, singing, reading, or hearing, and
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:97523:87"/>
you will be loth to leave that duty, and long to be at it again. O the sweetness therein, and love thereunto! <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.93. <hi>I shall never forget thy precepts, for with them thou hast quickened me.</hi> Oh when shall I come and appear before God! O that every day were a Sabbath, then should I be well, as said that famous <note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en</hi> of <hi>Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en-staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</hi> Cestr.</note> Instance of Practical Piety. Hence, with a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious heart, one duty prepares, and gets a stomach for another. But you shall find, when the heart is out of tune, and beating about the bush, and not half quarter of it with God; O then it is the most weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some imployment in the world! A man had rather thresh than pray, that hath his heart in the Barn, when he is in prayer. And there is no lively desires, or longings of soul to that business, wherein he felt so little of God. Hence it is so hard to get a worldly family to get together to prayer; Alas! the duty is a distraction to them; when they come, they still leave their hearts behind them; you can make them no penny-worth of an Ordinance, whose hearts do usually run out of an Ordinance.</p>

God Almighty may easily be heard, and his counsel will be taken. And also this godly sorrow (as was before observed) doth so afflict and make a mans heart to ake and smart, that he will take some pains to prevent the like anguish again. When they knock at door, you'l say, O these are they, that cost me dear at such a time: <hi>non emam tanti poeniteo.</hi> I feel yet the sad impressions of my late affliction for them; I found a pardon no easie enterprize, nor Repentance so pleasing a potion to brew for it again.

O Sirs, where godly sorrow is in the power of it, what carefulness doth it work? what zeal, what indignation, yea what revenge? It makes sin lye like a Mountain upon the soul, musters up all the aggravations of sin, and sets them home on the heart.

               <p>The full and clear vision, and fruition of this presence of God, doth so eternally ravish and content the soul in Heaven, that they would not look off the face of God for a thousand worlds; no, though all the Kings of the Earth in their greatest triumph, should pass by Heaven gates, and the Earth's utmost glory with them: A glorified soul is so full of the presence of God, that it would not spare one minut's look to see it all.

               <p>And here I cannot but digress a little, but it is to cure a more criminal digression, which is that frequent <hi>Abuse</hi> of <hi>Whispering</hi> and talking to one another, in the service of God, which except it be upon such in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant <hi>indispensable</hi> business, as cannot be ordered before or after the Ordinance, is a sin in an high degree, and that</p>

upon two</hi> at once. If a vain thought there be so evil, as you have heard, how crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal then is this, that involves you both, yea perhaps occasions a distraction to twenty more, that observe you? And the guilt of all their vain thoughts on that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion will be charged on your account, according to the equity of that Law, <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.23.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because this hath more of <hi>Affront</hi> in it. Thy heart testifies to God's face, that thou dost despise his presence. Who but an impudent <hi>Renegade</hi> would, while the King is laying down terms of mercy and honour to him, be talking and laughing with his companions at some uncouth Courtier that comes in? and who but an implicit Atheist shall be whispering with his neighbour about any thing, while the King of Heaven and Earth is treating with him about Eternity? You hold it no piece of good manners, while any man is speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to you, especially if he be your supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour, to neglect him so far, as to turn from him to discourse another; nay, if the most necessary business call you away, you apologize for your diversion, and crave pardon: And shall you dare while your Maker is in conference with you, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front

him with an open parle with others? This is an high affront, if you consider it well.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This hath more <hi>offence</hi> in it. An of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to the Preacher, that hath taken much pains to prepare that, which you will not take pains to hear, or else imply, it is not worth the hearing. An offence to the Congregation that sees it, who must needs, if they fear God<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

An offence to the Angels, that, while they stoop down to look into the mysteries opened in the Church, see you sleight them so notoriously: An of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence to your own souls, that perhaps in that moment miss of what would most have done them good. O therefore, Christian Reader! mourn for thy mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behaviour this way, and amend it for time to come, lest God refuse to treat with thee, that triflest thus in thy treating with him. Remember, it's work enough for a poor man, to converse with a great God. He needs no other business, to fill his hands.</p>
               <p>And then <hi>in Meditation</hi> you must also compose your senses. There shut your <hi>eye,</hi> and <hi>ear,</hi> and sequester your self whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the contemplation of things invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible.
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:97523:103"/>
The least sight or sound will here distract: Any thing, yea nothing will throw us off the hinges in this duty; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is said of <hi>Isaac, Gen.</hi> 24.63. <hi>That he went forth in the field in the evening-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And lastly, <hi>in communicating</hi> at the Lord's-table, there fix both your eyes on the sacred elements, until the eye have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the heart to feel what Christ felt, to die in his death, and <hi>looking</hi> on him whom you have pierced, you mourn for him with a superlative sorrow: And then look at those sacred signs with an eye of Faith, till virtue come from that brazen Serpent, to cure your sin-stung soul. Look yet again, till thy heart be inflamed with love to him, till he cry in Heaven, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.9. <hi>Thou hast ravished my heart, my Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, my Love, thou hast ravished my heart with one of thy eyes, with one chain about thy neck.</hi> He that spends his eye there
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97523:104"/>
to observe his neighbours, to criticize up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their gestures, hath little to do, and less to get in that sacred Ordinance. And then lay a Law upon thine ear, and tast, and touch, for most of the senses are gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified and useful in this Ordinance; that nothing may interrupt thy communion with Jesus Christ at that time. For there the utmost strength of body and soul are scarce enough, to gain, and feel, and do, what is there to be gain'd, and felt, and done.</p>
               <p>And in general, be not treacherous to your selves. Satan <hi>without you</hi> can do no great matters <hi>within you:</hi> your senses you can command, your hearts not so well. Be faithful in what ye can, else if you could order your very hearts, you would not. He that will not do what he can, would much less do, what he cannot.</p>

He that comes to visit his friend in a complement, he talks, he walks, he trifles, and goes home again, but he that comes upon bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness, he is full of it: He is like <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s honest and faithful Servant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24.33. <hi>And there was meat set before him to eat, but he said, I will not eat, till I have told mine errand.</hi> I have great business with the Lord, about the Church, and about my soul, and I will not eat, nor talk, nor think, nor dally about any thing, till I have told mine errand, or heard my Maker's errand unto me: And for this end, it's a rare thing to carry somewhat alwaies on the spirit to spread before God, an heart pregnant with some needful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, or matter whereof to treat with God, <hi>Psal.</hi> 45.1. <hi>My heart is inditing a good matter,</hi> and then, <hi>my tongue shall be

like the pen of a ready Writer</hi>; O then I shall go merrily on in his service, when I have matter prepared in my heart.

It is as much as your duty to get the <hi>second grace,</hi> as it was your duty to get the <hi>first grace</hi>; and as the want of this would damn you, so a want in that will displease God, and that is as bad.</p>

                  </gap>? And though a little grace be well for him that had none, yet it is not well for him that hath such means and motives for much grace, as thou hast had. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I renew my counsel, if ever you would attend upon God, or injoy him hereafter without distraction, strive for stronger grace. And to obtain it,</p>
               <p n="1">1. You must <hi>be upright and humble:</hi> Upright, for <hi>Iob</hi> 17.9. <hi>He that hath clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.</hi> The sound child grows, the child painted on the wall thrives not: so the sincere Christian, he, though he feel it not, comes on, and goes from strength to strength, but the hypocrite, he never grew, for he never had a root. And humble you must be. The humble vallies grow: God can never (he thinks) lay out too much upon an humble heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. You must <hi>manage the means of growth
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:97523:110"/>
with your whole strength.</hi> Attend upon the most edifying Ministry, read the most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Books, consort with the most lively growing Christians, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be frequent in the tryal of the state of your soul. Each week, if possible, call your selves to some account, and strive to discern a weekly growth; but if you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, desist not from that work, but try again: Single out some special grace, or duty to thrive in next week; as for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the grace of Patience, saving Knowledge, the duty of an Husband, Parent, or Child. And still be trying, you will find one time or other, what will fully pay you for your labour: only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, he that thrives in the world takes pains and care; and so in grace, he that will grow, must strive and sweat for it. A little grace is worth a great deal of pains.</p>
               <p>And thus you have the <hi>eighth Point,</hi> to wit, the <hi>Cure of Distractions,</hi> if you will apply it; but to what end are Rules, unless ye will be ruled by them? These helps cannot help you, except you now faithfully put them in practice. The plaister cures not in the box, but laid on the sore. And your charge be it,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:97523:111"/>

                  <note place="margin">§. 1.</note>BUT, lest any honest Christian should by his frequent distractions, be discouraged from his duties, or in his holy duties, I shall in the <hi>ninth place,</hi> prevent such a temptation, by laying down some Encouragements for those that groan under the burden of distractions. And here I assert two things:
<list>
                     <item>1. That these distractions should not <hi>drive you from your duties</hi>: You have been thinking, perhaps, it were better my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice were undone, than done so confused<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and our false hearts are secretly prone to accept any occasion to lay down our
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:97523:111"/>
work, but believe not the Devils rotten Divinity: he takes on him to be tender, lest God's name be taken in vain, but this is to insinuate you the more; but in this sense, <hi>obedience is better than sacrifice</hi>; thy obedience to his command, is more plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing to him, than thy torn sacrifice. And then it is a known case, that the omission of a duty will never fit one for a duty better. <hi>Luther</hi>'s saying herein, was, the more I neglect, the more unfit I am. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, some ground will mend my lying still, but that's better ground, than is in faln man's heart. Ours is the ground that must be stirr'd, and manured, and quickned, and then some fruit will come. As one sin fits the heart for another. so one duty fits the soul for another. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it's better to serve thy Master with a trembling hand, than not at all, and the Father takes well a well-intended work, though it be unwillingly marred in the making.</item>
                     <item>2. These distractions should not wholly <hi>discourage you in the performance of your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</hi> Despise you they must, discourage you they must not. Our good Master would not have us draw heavily in his service. It's prophesied, <hi>Psal.</hi> 138.5. <hi>They
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:97523:112"/>
shall sing in the waies of the Lord.</hi> This is a sweet hearing. God's work goes best on, when we sing at it. All the infirmities of a Christian laid together, yet should not discourage him in his duty. <hi>Si dixeris, doleo, sufficit.</hi> And for your support, I lay down these incouragements.</item>

Grace may live with them, but not be lively long with them: They are like the blew and yellow weeds, that grow with the best corn that is. Grace may live with them, though it can never agree with them: and therefore conclude not against thy self, O I have no grace, I am so pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stred with these things: surely no child of God hath such an heart. For this is an epidemick distemper; where-ever the hand of God hath sown good seed, the enemy hath scattered these his tares amongst it. Indeed there is no sin so crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that is absolutely inconsistent with grace, abate but that transcendent one, <hi>the sin against the Holy Ghost:</hi> Let no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane heart make use hereof to hearten them in their sins: a prophane heart, I say, for a gracious heart is of another temper.

yea may creep into them, and lodge in them for a season. How much more may a sudden thought break in, which, like lightning, springs into the heart without any warning? Do not therefore cry out, when this or any other corruption steals into your hearts, I am a lost man, this <hi>cannot consist</hi> with grace, but this <hi>should not consist</hi> with grace.

Alas! what broken and torn sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices do we bring to our God? what a fair escape have we with our lives and senses out of the presence of God? As that <hi>Emperour</hi> killed the <hi>Centinel</hi> on the place, whom he found asleep; saying, <hi>Dead I found thee, and dead I leave thee.</hi> So most justly might the Lord answer our <hi>distracted duties,</hi> with <hi>distracting terrours,</hi> and leave us under the judgement of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction, for our sins in distractions. And what a piece of ignorance and impudence is it, for any man to be proud of his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? Alas! the best duties are of divers colours, like the Beggar's Coat, and what Beggar will be proud of his patched Coat? If there were any flowers or spices in thy duties, they were none of thine, from thee came all the stench, from above came all the perfumes; and what poor reason then hast thou to be proud? It is sad, that when our sins make us humble, our duties should make us proud, <hi>Isa.</hi> 64.6. <hi>We are all as an unclean thing, and all our righteousnesses are as filthy raggs, for there is none that —stirreth up himself to take hold of thee.</hi> With what shame and trouble would we go among folks, if we had no better

cloaths than filthy raggs? and yet how high we look, that have no better cloaths of our own, upon our souls? if you wear any better, they are borrowed garments, and what silly wretch is proud of borrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed garments?</p>
               <p>And this shews likewise, what need we have of the Righteousness of <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> to make our prayers pass into the holy place. It was the smoak of the Incense which came with the prayers of the Saints, and ascended up before God out of the Angels hand, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.4.

Our quaintest <hi>Oratory</hi> is broken and ineffectual. His intercession is constant and <hi>Imperatory.</hi> Go therefore to the Throne of Grace, <hi>leaning on your Beloved.</hi> Keep an actual eye to Christ's mediation in your prayers, and though you bring in his precious Name in the fagg end of your supplication, yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber you have need of him in every sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; a broken prayer had need of an intire Mediator.</p>

A watchful Christian hath his heart ready at a call: it is quickly in tune that was never out. Holy duties are not heterogeneous to any holy heart, the same frame will serve. He that walks with God, is never out of his way. A short, or rather no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, will serve to usher in conference, with whom you have been conversing all the day. It is sometimes the whole work of a prayer to be acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God. Away with this strange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; if you will be upright, walk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, and watch unto prayer.

Thou art impotent, God is omnipotent. And then practise it, the use of it will teach the Art of it; as children learn to go step by step, as they learn to swim, by venturing. Adventure on this exercise, try one week, try one day, try one hour, try the next duty. As you renew your falls, still renew your vows; you can do all things through Christ that will strengthen you. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech you in Christ's behalf, set on this duty in good earnest. You will pay me for all my pains with one well-grounded resolution, to set up a constant watch.

               <p>And most especially in the service of God <note n="*" place="margin">1 Pet. 1.13. <hi>Gird up the loins of your mind.</hi> As loose cloaths hinder a journey, so loose hearts hinder a duty.</note>. Watch and pray Christ hath joyned together, and what Christ hath joyned together, let no man, especially no good man put asunder. What is the first step in an Ordinance? (as the <hi>Orator</hi> of old in another case) Watchfulness. What is the second step in an Ordinance? Watchfulness. What is the third step in an Ordinance? still Watchfulness. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly</p>
               <p>First, <hi>In Prayer.</hi> Prayer is a pouring out the heart unto the Lord; by a distraction you pour it by <hi>Psal.</hi> 62.5. <hi>My soul, wait thou ONLY upon God, for my expectation is from him.</hi> A distraction imposes two Masters on the soul to wait on. Rovings in prayer make that which is our most rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable service, the most irrational thing in the world. No folly like speaking to one person, and thinking of another <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Eternam vitam or a petimus, nec tamen corde desideramus, clamantes tacemus; si vero desideramus ex corde, etiam cum ore conticescimus, tacentes clamamus,</hi> Greg. lib. 22. in Job.</note>.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>In hearing God's Word.</hi> This is the audible conference of the Almighty with thy soul. A distraction lets him
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:97523:124"/>
talk unto the walls. When you come to a Sermon, you <hi>stand on your watch, and set your self on the Tower, and watch to see what God will say to you,</hi> Hab. 2.1. By a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction you do almost, as if a servant stopt his ears at the orders that his Master is giving.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>In reading.</hi> Therein you <note n="*" place="margin">

A distraction nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther understands, nor applies those sacred characters. Which of you would so read your Father's last Will, especially in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that concern'd your selves? One chapter, one leaf, one verse well read and applied, will do your heart more good, than an hundred read with half an heart.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, <hi>In singing Psalms,</hi> you had need to watch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Thereby you pay unto God the Rent of his mercies. A di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straction clips the coin, and turns the heart to do homage to the Devil. Well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved therefore of <hi>David, Psal.</hi> 103.1. <hi>Bless the Lord, O my soul, and ALL THAT IS WITHIN ME praise his holy Name.</hi> Thy melody is <hi>base,</hi> if the <hi>main</hi> strength of the soul be not in it. I am perswaded
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:97523:124"/>
that God hath suffer'd this Ordinance in particular to be slurr'd once and again, to be left off by some, and cast off by others, out of his just Judgement, there being so general a neglect of the inward and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing management thereof. For where sits the man <note n="*" place="margin">

Nay, if the truth were known, there is hardly one passage, that's felt from the beginning to the end: for if it were, O the heavenly affections it would raise, and the sweet frame it would leave on the soul! you would not part with that Ordinance out of your Families, nor Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, for all the world.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, <hi>In Meditation,</hi> great need of watchfulness, else when the soul is soar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aloft, like the Eagle, these darts will, or ever you are aware, strike down the heart again. O how hard is it to spend a quarter of an hour in meditation without a distraction! If there be any thing in the fancy, if there be any thing in the room, if there be any thing in the world, thou wilt have it, to withdraw thy heart from God. And generally the more spiritual the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the more distractions. And therefore <hi>I say unto you, watch.</hi>

Those that have an habitual ability against these snares, O bless the Lord for it! it's he that keeps the heart in tune, not you. We like little children, can break the strings, and put our hearts out of tune, but 'tis the Lord that sets and keeps us in order. You little know the anxiety, and fear, and trouble, that these do cost many a poor Christian; they strive, they mourn, they doubt, they are ready to throw up all: These Vultures do gnaw upon their very hearts; no comfort, no joy of the Holy Ghost, no peace within, and all through the continual assaults hereof. And by the only mercy of God thou art well and free. Thou canst continue instant in prayer, thou canst come to Heaven gates, and get thy errand heard, thy business dispatcht, and little distraction in it. O give the Lord praise, lest he leave thee to thy self, and then thy case will be more miserable than theirs. Thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness keeps the mercy which ingratitude

               <p>Yea, those that are oft pestered with them, and yet sometimes freed, bless the Lord for that. It is as much your duty to praise God when you are freed, as to bewail it when you have failed. It is the comparison of a good <hi>Divine</hi>; if a man have planted many Trees in his Orchard, and the Caterpillars, or Cankers have consumed them all, but one or two, how glad will he be of them that are left, and make much of them? the rest are kill'd, and these only remain. Even so thy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Religion, which thou hast planted, and expectedst they should bring thee some good fruit; but alas! these Cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillars have consumed it, unless it be here and there a prayer, here and there a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, that have scap'd; O bless the Lord for these! you have often prayed for such a mercy, now you have it: Let praises wear, what prayers have won. It is sad to consider, what a beggarly spirit we are of: if we want any thing, Heaven and Earth shall ring of us; but we are graves, wherein the gifts of God are buried with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any resurrection. Where is the heart
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:97523:126"/>
that is pregnant with praises, that cries out to his friend, O help me to praise the Lord! Divide our lives, and the one half of them is mercies, and the other half is sins: and yet divide our prayers, and hardly the tenth part is spent in praises. Alas! thanks is a tacite begging. Let God gain the glory, and thou shalt not lose the advantage. <hi>The God of</hi> Israel <hi>is he that giveth strength to his people, blessed be God,</hi> Psal. 68.35. Conclude with the <hi>Psalmist,</hi> Not unto me, O Lord, not unto me, but unto thy Name give glory. Think not, when thou hast attended on the Lord without distractions, I have quit my self well, but mercy hath quit its self well. He that justly payes his score shall be trusted again.</p>
