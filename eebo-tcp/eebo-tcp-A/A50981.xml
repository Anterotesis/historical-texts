            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>Miraculous Faſting</hi> OF THE NAKED-MAN; Being a Strange and True Account how Mr. <hi>Joſeph Wright,</hi> (who, for Ten or Twelve Years laſt paſt, went <hi>Naked</hi> through the Streets of the City and Suburbs of <hi>London</hi>) has Liv'd in the <hi>Poultery-Compter</hi> Thirty Five Days without <hi>Eating</hi> or <hi>Drinking,</hi> notwithſtanding he had loſt Twelve Ounces of Blood the day before his Confinement.</head>
            <p>IT is not unknown to moſt of the Inhabitants in and about the City of <hi>London,</hi> how Mr. <hi>Joſeph Wright</hi> has for Reaſons (beſt known to himſelf) gone Naked, from the Waſte upwards, and expoſed himſelf to the tharpeſt and keeneſt Froſts, that have happen'd in ſo many Years, not regarding the Admonitions and Perſwaſions of his Friends to the contrary, who are known to be Perſons of good Worth; ſo that 'tis believed his Obſtinacy proceeded from a Reſolution as unaccountable and irrevocable, as this which he has taken up of late, being reſolved not to Eat nor <hi>Drink</hi> during his Confinement.</p>
            <p>About five Weeks ago, he being a little out of order, was Blooded, and there was taken from him Twelve Ounces of Blood; the next day walking Abroad, he was Arreſted by a Serjeant, and carried to a <hi>Spunging-Houſe</hi> in <hi>Grocers-Alley,</hi> where he ſeemed very much diſſatisfied at the wrong they had done him, he being (as he ſaid) a perfect Stranger to the Perſons that cauſed his Arreſt, inſomuch that he would ſuffer no Company to come near him, except one Woman. The Landlady of the <hi>Spunging-Houſe</hi> not caring for ſuch a Gueſt as would neither Eat nor Drink, (he having vowed not to Eat nor Drink till he was at Liberty) ſent him to the <hi>Poultry-Compter,</hi> where he took a Chamber, and immediately Lock'd himſelf up, not ſuffering any one willingly to come near him, except to make his Bed, and bring him an Apple in a Day, to chew on, and Spit out again; not allowing himſelf any other Suſtenance to ſupport Nature; Inſomuch that he is worn to an Anoto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in his Body, yet his Face looks tollerably well. There have been ſeveral Perſons to diſſwade him from ſo Obſtinate a Humour, and not to be guilty of his own Death; but all of them are repulſed by his ſharp Repartees, bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them mind their own Welfare, and not moleſt him; he being continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly peeviſh, not caring to be ask'd any Queſtions. He hath faſted Thirty-five Days, which can be teſtified upon Oath, by ſeveral in the <hi>Poultry-Cimpter,</hi> if required, and particularly by a Sober Woman that attends him. It is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous thar Fleſh and Blood can ſubſiſt ſo long without Suſtenance, and 'tis ſappoſed by his Appearance and hearty Speaking, he may live ſometime longer; ſo great a Wonder hath not been known, especially by one who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns more to affront the Deity by ſelf-Murder, than out of any Zeal or good Intent. He not ſeeming otherwiſe Diſturbed, or Diſtracted in Mind, but able to return a Rational Anſwer to thoſe, to whom he will vouchſafe to ſpeak.</p>
