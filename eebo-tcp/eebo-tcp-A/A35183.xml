            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOur voluntary undertaking this honourable
loyal Exercise of Armes, is in order to
render your selves thereby the more useful to your
King and Countrey.</p>
            <p>That Government which preserves us (that it
may so do) must be inviolably preserved by us:
And certainly 'tis a great Debt and Duty which
we all owe to it.</p>
            <p>'Twas long since the wonder of an ingenious

&amp;c. Speaking of Man, says he, Oh
God! the Creator of all things, what a strange,
temerarious, rash, unmanageable kind of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is this which thou hast placed upon the earth!</p>
            <p>We may resolve his Riddle, and answer as
<hi>Solomon,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 7. 29.</note> 
               <hi>God made man upright</hi> at first
<pb facs="tcp:30968:3"/>
But ever since the wretched Fall of our First Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
all manner of Distempers and ill humours
are like the Sons of <hi>Zerviah,</hi> too hard for us;
and even inherent in our corrupt Natures.</p>
            <p>Experience shews us,<note place="margin">Jam. 3. 7, 8.</note> all other Creatures are
and have been tamed by Mankind; but (as
holy Scripture observes) we our selves remain
still in many things too unruly.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The</hi> All-wise God <hi>hath given us the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
of Government (as</hi> David'<hi>s Harp in</hi>
Saul'<hi>s Case) to charme this unquiet and evil
Spirit; That we might go the journey of life,
not as</hi> Savages <hi>but as</hi> Men. <hi>And (which is
far more) as the professed Servants of that God,</hi>
who is not the Author of confusion,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14. 33.</note> but of
peace, as in all the Churches of the Saints.</p>
            <p>My Endeavours have been, inoffensively to
strengthen so Divine a Concern in this ensuing
Sermon. As your desires occasioned the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing

but these, as <hi>Phaeton,</hi> attempt to fire the
whole world; as <hi>Achan,</hi> they trouble all
<hi>Israel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our late times have prov'd too clear a
Comment upon so sad a Text: wherein
the insolent extravagant fancies of some
few, brought in confusion upon the whole.</p>
            <p>Then was that joyless Scripture written
in large Characters, in letters of blood, he
that ran might read it;<note place="margin">

               <hi>The Child then behaved
himself proudly against the ancient, and the base
against the honourable;</hi> then were the <hi>people
oppressed every one by another.</hi> And the foot of
that doleful Song was still of the same
Tune,<note place="margin">Jud. 17. 6.</note> and like the rest, <hi>In those days there
was no King in Israel, but every man did that
which was right in his own eyes.</hi> The Text
offers very fair to obviate these great evils,
and may serve as a Divine Antidote to
prevent our relapsing any more into
them.</p>
            <p>The words are part of a very memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
History. For our better understanding
whereof, we may take notice, 1. Of the
action it self here on foot, The security
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:30968:4"/>
of the King and Kingdom. 2. The
Conjuncture of time when, Upon a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Restauration. 3. The Person chiefly
managing this great affair, <hi>Jehojadah</hi> the
High Priest. 4. The means and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
whereby he carrieth it on; and they
are both Divine and humane.</p>
            <p>1. The action it self here on foot,
The security of the King and Kingdom:
A high Concern! The preserving the
Ship wherein we are all imbarqu'd. A
loyal care for the support of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
the <hi>Subjects,</hi> as well as the <hi>Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns</hi>
safety. A Concern so essential, that
the <hi>Roman Oratour</hi> (and indeed all experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
as freely) tells us, Neither Family
nor City, neither People nor Country,
neither the Heavens nor the Earth, can
any of them subsist without it. He that
faithfully stands by Government, shews
himself a friend to his own safety, as well
as a true Liege-man to his Prince.<note place="margin">Lam. 4. 20.</note> 
               <hi>Gods
anointed,</hi> and the <hi>breath of our nostrils,</hi> they
may be two distinct <hi>Periphrases,</hi> but they
both make up but one and the same <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son</hi>
in Scripture account. Our loyalty to
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:30968:5"/>
him, is at second hand a kindness to the
breath of our own nostrils.</p>
            <p>The Government thus zealously own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Text, is that of <hi>Monarchy.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
as the Philosopher calls it,
The first, the ancientest, the noblest, the
divinest Form of Government upon the
face of the Earth. In the time of the
<hi>Patriarchs,</hi> in the time of the <hi>Judges,</hi> in
the time of the <hi>Kings of Israel</hi> the titles
might and did vary; but 'twas still a
real visible Monarchy. The bright I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage
of Gods Government over his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<hi>The Kingdom is the Lords, and he is
the Governour amongst the Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon which account the Ancients
paid so great a veneration to it.<note place="margin">Plato.</note> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.
When we see a
King amongst his Subjects, we may
therein behold a prospect far more divine,
a less but lively Pourtraicture of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestial
Empire. It fairly brings to mind
the regency of Almighty God over the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverse.</p>
            <p>Now as to their fidelity to this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
The Text would have that
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:30968:5"/>
demonstrated in their utmost care for the
person and safety of the <hi>Governour.</hi> In
this sense the meanest Subject may be
truly said to be one of his Sovereigns Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard,
most highly concern'd in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation.
If we would strengthen the
house,<note place="margin">Psal. 75. 3.</note> we must not weaken him that <hi>bears
up the Pillars of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We have here no news of that traite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Position, Taking up of armes by the
Kings Authority against his Person. The
Lover of his Prince is not here run down
in a popular fury as a dangerous Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.
The faithful Royalist is not here
sequestred and sentenc'd as a Criminal
Delinquent. We hear of no specious hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical
crying up the well-affected Party,
or the <hi>Good Old Cause;</hi> the more easily to
oppress, the more invidiously to bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
contempt any that should dare
(though never so modestly) to owne our
fundamental Laws and Government.</p>
            <p>The Text is of a far different <hi>Genius;</hi>
serene and regular, deliberately issuing
out a legal <hi>Commission of Array</hi> for the just
defence of King and Kingdom. The
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:30968:6"/>
truest Patriot to his Country bears as true
Allegiance to his Prince: what God and
right reason have so nearly joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he dares not morosely put asunder.
He understands not, how bad measures
toward the <hi>Pilot</hi> can ever become good
offices to the <hi>Ship.</hi> The <hi>Relate</hi> and <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relate</hi>
(in all true Polity as well as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture)
either live or dye together. <hi>God
save both King and Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. We have the Conjuncture of time,
when this great transaction happened, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a most welcom restauration. The Case
was briefly this, <hi>Athaliah</hi> the Daughter of
<hi>Ahab</hi> becomes married to <hi>Jehoram</hi> King
of <hi>Judah:</hi> upon his death <hi>Ahaziah</hi> his Son
succeedeth in the Throne. He being
slain by <hi>Jehu, Athaliah</hi> his Mother (an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
idolatrous Woman) destroys all
the Seed Royal that She could any way
come at, and for several years usurps the
Crown. Most unnaturally verifying that
of the Poet,
<q>
                  <l>Saevus Amor docuit natorum sanguine matres</l>
                  <l>Commaculare manus.</l>
               </q>
Whether it were by Sword or Poyson, or
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:30968:6"/>
by what other means this wretched wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
procur'd the death of these Children
(many of them her Nephews and near
Relations) is not express'd: but plain it
is, 'twas most impiously and inhumanely
done. <hi>Per fas per nefas,</hi> is the great Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xime

While the rightful Prince chuseth to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
by methods of clemency and gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
the Tyrant or Usurper swims com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
through Seas of Blood to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sparate
Designs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Athaliah</hi>'s aim was to cut off the right
Line of the House of <hi>David.</hi> More par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly,
all that descended from that pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
good Prince <hi>Jehosaphat,</hi> (her own
Husbands Father) whose Reformation
She had so highly stomach'd, and now
thrown down. Never did the most vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicable
Reformation want its Enemies,
or the most treasonable enterprize some
Bigotted <hi>Zealot,</hi> some blind <hi>Devoto</hi> to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in it.</p>
            <p>But behold, after she has waded thus
far in blood, she begins now (like <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh</hi>
and his Chariots) to sink in this Red
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:30968:7"/>
Sea. Never did Treason thrive long with
the Traitor. The rightful Heir is still
safe, survives the attempts of malice, and
is brought with triumph to enjoy his own.
<hi>Jehoshebah the daughter of king Joram sister
of Ahaziah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Kin. 11. 2.</note> 
               <hi>took Joash the Son of Ahaziah,
and stole him from among the kings-sons which
were slain; so that he was not slain.</hi> There
is a God in Heaven that takes care of
Princes here on Earth. The rage and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginations
of the people against him
and his Anointed, they are but vain, suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessess
things. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> may give strict
charge to destroy the Children of <hi>Israel,</hi>
but Gods <hi>Moses</hi> is even miraculously pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served,
that he might be King in <hi>Jesurun;
Herod</hi> may murther the Infants in <hi>Bethle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hem,</hi>
but the Lords <hi>Christ</hi> escapes his
bloody hands.</p>
            <p>The Text exemplifies the Case with a
living <hi>Joash, England</hi> illustrates it with a
living <hi>Charles,</hi> after all the various snares
of death so often contriv'd and laid for
both.</p>
            <p>And now the day dawns apace, the
Restauration becomes conspicuous, <hi>They
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:30968:7"/>
brought forth the kings son,<note place="margin">2 Kin. 11. 12.</note> they put the Crown
upon him, and they made him King.</hi> The Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers
shoot sore, yet the royal Bow abides
still in strength. Thus signally does the
Providence of God baffle and triumph o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Conspiracies of men.</p>
            <p>We might modestly challenge the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable
Plottings of most Ages in the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Prophet, <hi>Surely this turning of
things upside down is but in vain. The Stone
which the Builders refused, becomes</hi> neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
<hi>the head of the Corner.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this posture were the present Affairs
of <hi>Judah: Joash</hi> (far beyond all humane
expectations) brought as another <hi>Isaac</hi> in
a Figure from the Dead, restored with
Honour to the Throne of his Forefathers.
All their former confusions now fairly end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
the Land orderly settled,<note place="margin">vers. 12.</note> 
               <hi>the people
clapping their hands, and saying, God save the
King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And so we come to the third, The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son
chiefly instrumental in bringing about
this eminent, this desired revolution. 'Tis
pity that good actions should stick in the
birth for want of some willing hands to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:30968:8"/>
assist, and facilitate their being brought
forth.</p>
            <p>No doubt, there were many Worthies
in <hi>Israel,</hi> heroically appearing in so just, so
generous, so publick a concern. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
we find chiefly mentioned in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story,
is <hi>Jehojadah</hi> the High Priest.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jehoshebah,</hi> she has the honour of shelte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the King under his first and most im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
dangers. That God that has the
whole world at his command, chuses what
instruments he will please to work by. A
weak woman (as you have already heard)
acts so noble a part towards the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>She was both Daughter and Sister to a
King; and now Wife to this <hi>Jehojadah</hi> the
High Priest: which gives us occasion of
calling to mind that passage of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
when in token of further favour he would
chuse a Wife for <hi>Joseph</hi> his prime Minister
of State, he gives him <hi>Asenath</hi> the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of <hi>Potipherah</hi> Priest of <hi>On;</hi> supposing
(as it seems) a Match into such a Family
no disgrace to the greatest Peer in his
whole Kingdom.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:30968:8"/>Such was <hi>Jehojadah,</hi> venerable in his
Function, and as honourable in his Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Uncle to the present King, Brother
to the former, an eminent pillar both in
<hi>Church and State</hi> all his days. He lived in
this unspotted piety an hundred and thirty
years, and died as he lived, still laden with
fresh honours. For the sake of this and
many other his great services to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
he was solemnly interred amongst the
Royal Sepulchers of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 24. 16.</note>
               <hi>And they buried him in the City of</hi> David <hi>among
the Kings, because he had done good in</hi> Israel,
<hi>both towards God and towards his House.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men and Brethren, <hi>would to God you could
bear with me a little in my folly, and indeed bear
with me,</hi> if I say, The Priesthood has been
(as you see) highly esteemed in elder times,
how contemptible soever it may seem to
many in these late disingenuous days. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
and prophane History are both unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
in this. Our reverence to God will
manifest it self in our respects to his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters.
He that truly loves the Master, will
not be very forward to despise his Servant.</p>
            <p>We find <hi>Jehojadah</hi> Privy-Counsellour to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:30968:9"/>
               <hi>Joash:</hi> Nor was it amiss either for King or
Kingdom. If he had a potent hand, he
had also a successful hand in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of Affairs: which the holy Ghost
is pleased to take a particular notice of,
to the honour of those happy times, and so
to leave it upon record for the instruction
of future Ages,<note place="margin">2 Kin. 12. 2</note> 
               <hi>And Joash did that which was
right in the sight of the Lord all his days, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
Jehojadah the High Priest instructed him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if Princes out of reverence to such
ancient Scripture-Precedents (no bad Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies
for any to write after) if they have
seen meet in these later days to continue
somewhat of this practice in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
here seemeth no matter of grievance
or offence given to any. Nor needeth our
eye be evil, where the eye of God is good.</p>
            <p>Sure we are,<note place="margin">Orat. ad Pontif.</note> 
               <hi>Cicero</hi> valued it as a <hi>nihil prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarius,</hi>
&amp;c. he thought they had nothing
more noble in the whole oeconomy of
their Government than this, That their
Priests were highly honoured, and persons
whose joint assistance was always so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectfully
taken and made use of in the
arduous affairs of their State.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:30968:9"/>Nor was it so much personally for their
own sakes, but rather for the sake of the
Sphere in which these men stood, that wise
and sage Governours saw cause to conferre
such signal tokens of honour upon them.</p>
            <p>It seems to savour very much of unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
or prejudice, to labour the deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
of so sacred an Order. Had the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
of any Civil trust or power into
such hands, been so prodigiously irregular
or dangerous to Government (as some
would censure it) certainly Almighty God
would never have given that express
charge, which we find he did to <hi>Israel,
The Priests the Sons of Levi,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 21. 5.</note> 
               <hi>whom God hath
chosen to bless in his Name, by their word shall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
controversie and every stroke be tried.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Kingdom of <hi>Judah</hi> had now for se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
years lain under a most horrid Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasie
and Usurpation; <hi>Jehojadah</hi> restores
the King to his Throne, and (together
therewith) Religion also to its true ancient
state. It had been prostituted to all abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable
Idolatries; 'tis now most happily
recovered to pure original institution, <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hojadah
appointed the Offices of the House of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:30968:10"/>
Lord by the hands of the Priests,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 23. 18.</note> 
               <hi>the Levites,
whom David had distributed in the House of the
Lord, to offer the burnt-offerings of the Lord;
as it is written in the Law of Moses, with rejoycing
and with singing, as it was ordained by David.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Usurpation over the State was not
without a depravation of Religion in the
Church. They are commonly both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd
in the same Fate. The Case before
us is a lively instance of it. The return of
<hi>Joash,</hi> the right Heir to the Throne, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
crown'd with the re-establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the true state of Religion.</p>
            <p>And all this so acceptable throughtout
the Kingdome, that 'tis said, <hi>All the people
of the Land rejoyced;</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 23. 21.</note> 
               <hi>and the City was quiet.</hi>
So happy are the consequences of a right
settlement in Church and State: all is then
at a kindly rest, fairly repos'd in its proper
Centre. Cursed be he that would disturb
so just a joy, or disquiet so good a peace.
May <hi>England</hi> long enjoy this dear, this sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
blessing; and let all the people say <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. We have the means whereby <hi>Jehoja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>
carried on the whole; and they are in

               <hi>Jehojadah</hi> admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters
to the King the Coronation Oath,
solemnly anoints him, and delivers the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony
of the Law into his hands:
which Book (as the Jewish Writers relate)
was to be always, and in all places present
with him. If he went out to War, that
also went along with him. If he sate in
Judgment, that was constantly laid before
him. That he might consult with it as
with the Oracle of God, to direct him in
all his ways.</p>
            <p>'Tis Religion that is the true <hi>Jachin</hi> and
<hi>Boaz,</hi> the strength and stability of any
Kingdome. The <hi>Tragedian</hi> could easily
observe, <hi>Ubi non est sanctitas, pietas, fides,
instabile Regnum est.</hi> Where piety and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
die, the Kingdom it self dies also with
them.</p>
            <p>God forbid, we should be careless of
that which (through the Divine Blessing)
is to be our best and chief support. Have
we any principles of honour? any good
will to publick welfare? ought that may
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:30968:11"/>
become the dignity of humane nature, or
the sacredness of Christian Profession? Oh
then instead of this common curst way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardness
one against another, let us unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously
pluck up generous resolutions, to
do every one what in us lies for retrieving
(what we all seem to long for) solid, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
Christianity; the hearty exercise of
all moral vertues, all Christian Graces, that
<hi>England</hi> may yet flourish, and <hi>Religion</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
indeed a praise amongst us.</p>
            <p>Most will seem, as <hi>Judas,</hi> to kiss, though
too many rather betray this sacred interest.
Religion is high, and little understood.
There may be much of popular humorous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,
too much of fulsome, stubborn con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitedness,
and yet too little of real genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine
religiousness.</p>
            <p>The Weavers Shuttle may serve in his
Loom, the Shoo-makers Last may be of
use in his Shop; but when the common
People must needs turn <hi>Dictators</hi> in matters
too high for them, and take the Chair in
the <hi>Divinity-Schools,</hi> the issue generally proves
like that in <hi>Exodus, They turn presently out of
the right way, they make but calvish Gods,</hi> and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:30968:11"/>
(as <hi>Aaron</hi> complain'd in that case) <hi>they shew
themselves set upon mischief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Reformation of the Text is more
august and solemn. The service of the
<hi>Temple</hi> in its just decency and order; Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture
peaceably practis'd, though not liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giously
or absurdly canted and talked of.</p>
            <p>2. The second sort of means was Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
and Military, <hi>Every man with his weapon
in his hand.</hi> The insolencies and mischiefs
had been so notorious under the late usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation,
that <hi>Jehojadah</hi> sees it needful to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
the stronger Guards for his Princes
safety now.</p>
            <p>These Arms were said to be <hi>David</hi>'s,<note place="margin">2 Kin, 11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10.</note> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
by him, and now laid up in some
Chambers of the Temple in a readiness,
as any occasion might afterward require.
<hi>Sanctus Rex post partas victorias,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Peter Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr.</note> 
               <hi>Arma sua vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luit
esse Deo consecrata;</hi> Holy <hi>David</hi> after his
many atchievements and victories, conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates
his Armes to God. Thus he had laid
up <hi>Goliah</hi>'s Sword with <hi>Ahimelek</hi> the Priest
long before. These he dedicates as <hi>Trophees</hi>
for honour and instruction: for honour to
Almighty God, the supreme Deliverer; for
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:30968:12"/>
struction to men, that they might the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
preserve the history and memorial of
Gods great goodness.</p>
            <p>The charge of these Guards was both
offensive and defensive. 1. Offensive, <hi>He
that cometh within the ranges, let him be slain;</hi>
that is, he that thrusteth himself beyond
the appointed bounds, he that rudely rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
within the Centries, nearer the Royal
Presence than may consist with the safety
of the Sovereign, let him be slain. There
is a distance to be observ'd, as well as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence
to be paid, in all our approaches
to Majesty.</p>
            <p>2. Their ultimate charge and service,
was the defence of the Kings Person. In
Nature, the hand or arm upon any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
offers it self of its own accord to shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
the head. In Government the Case is
still parallel; The loyal Subject sees no
such way to preserve the Body, as by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
truly careful for the head.</p>
            <p>Upon this account, <hi>David</hi>'s Worthies,
though they cared not how far they jeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parded
themselves, yet they could not
bear that their Sovereigns Person should
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:30968:12"/>
come within the least shadow of danger,
<hi>Then the men of David sware unto him,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 21. 17.</note> 
               <hi>saying
Thou shalt go no more out with us to battel, that
thou quench not the light of Israel.</hi> Lo here
their piety as to their Prince, lo here their
prudence as to themselves. They easily
concluded the Eclipse of this <hi>Sun</hi> in their
<hi>Horizon,</hi> would be darkness to all <hi>Israel.</hi>
The smiting this Shepherd would be no
less than the scattering of the Flock.</p>
            <p>In this respect his most religious faithful
Subjects thought it no flattery to tell him
elsewhere,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 18. 3.</note> 
               <hi>Thou art worth ten thousand of
us.</hi> In a theological sence, the meanest
of <hi>David</hi>'s Servants, had a heaven-born,
immortal Soul as well as <hi>David,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
of the same equal price and value in the
sight of God. But in a political sence, <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s
single life weighs more than many
thousands of theirs. The Person of our
Sovereign must be sacred with us.</p>
            <p>Gentlemen, I shall not now affect to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise
you with any further discourse in mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
language from the Pulpit. There is a <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>,
a decency proper to the Church, a
decency proper to the Field. All things
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:30968:13"/>
are most beautiful in their own places.</p>
            <p>Neither shall I <hi>Classicum canere.</hi> 'Twas
but ill with <hi>England,</hi> when our Pulpits
sounded at that thundring rate, <hi>Curse ye</hi>
Meroz. By such specious fallacies the
poor unstable multitude were conjur'd up
into an open Rebellion against their lawful
Prince. By such Bellows were the flames
of our bloody wars too much blown up.
The Christian Ministers work is more gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle;
the preaching up of peace, the sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the minds of all one towards another.
That all meekness may be shewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
all men, especially towards those
whom God hath set over us. Others may
be for fierceness, unadvisedly calling for
fire from Heaven; but <hi>nil nisi mite suadet
Evangelium,</hi> the Gospel pleads for a more
sedate calmness and candour of spirit.</p>
            <p>I confess, as one well observes, Expert
Souldiers and good Armes,<note place="margin">Tacitus.</note> they are <hi>in Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce
Decus, in Bello Praesidium,</hi> our Ornaments
in Peace, our Safety in War. But still
the Christian Souldier looks upon War as
the means, Peace as the more desired end.
War, though in some cases both needful
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:30968:13"/>
and lawful, 'tis yet to him as so much Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick,
always sharp: he esteems Peace as
health; of a far sweeter relish, and much
more welcome to all.</p>
            <p>He wants not valour. When ever just
occasion calls for it, he could cheerfully
say to his Prince, as <hi>David</hi> to <hi>Saul, I will go
and fight with this Philistine;</hi> and yet so mild
in his own habitual temper, that the same
<hi>David</hi>'s Motto is as truly his,<note place="margin">Psa. 120. 7.</note> 
               <hi>I am for peace.</hi>

While we hear of Plottings a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

every true-hearted Subject (by a noble <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiperistasis</hi>)
to shew the greater zeal for
both.</p>
            <p>And I hope your regular forwardness

that the Government might be at the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

            <p>And now, Men and Brethren, while

in the Church, that it dares owne
the venerable Antiquities of primitive and
purer Times; and yet as zealously reject
the absurd inchroachments and corruptions
of later Ages. A Reformation, so clearly
subservient to all good ends; so careful to
nourish us up with wholesome food, <hi>the
words of sound Doctrine;</hi> so ready to furnish
us with the means of Grace, (soberly and
truly so call'd) that if our design by Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
be (what it ought to be) nakedly to
save our Souls, we may then in all quiet
Communion with the Church of <hi>England,</hi>
pass fairly to Heaven, as the Traveller
who goes his whole journey in a pleasant
sun-shine day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>God hath not dealt so with other Nations; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
have they such confortable freedome in Gods
ways.</hi> Your selves, who have many of you
travell'd into Foreign Parts, and have seen
the sad circumstances of poor <hi>Peasants</hi>
there, your selves right well know it. And
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:30968:15"/>
we may all of us gratefully sing as <hi>David,
The lines are fallen to us in pleasant places,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 16. 6.</note> and
we have through the Divine Providence <hi>a
goodly heritage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I could not but offer you this memorial
for your encouragement from the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
of the Government: A Government
most highly priz'd by others abroad, O let
it not be as unworthily despised by us at
home.</p>
            <p>I might as pathetically adjure you from
the common miseries (scarce ever to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten)
under our late want of it. A Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
fitter for tears than words. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire
of all good men that it might for ever
sleep in the deepest silence, did not the
noise of our present distempers and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
awake it, that it might fairly give
warning to all.</p>
            <p>Then was that Scripture-Lamentation so
mournfully reviv'd, <hi>Wo is us, the Crown is fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
from us.</hi> Then were the barbarous assaults
against sacred Majesty so common and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
in almost all places. First <hi>in Effigie,</hi> At
one place the eyes in the Statue of King
<hi>Edward</hi> VI. insolently plucked out, with this
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:30968:15"/>
absurd, villanous taunt, <hi>All this mischief came
from him, in his establishing the Book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At another place, the Crown upon the
Statue of our late <hi>Sovereign</hi> contumeliously
mangled by the rude Souldiers Swords.
Then the <hi>Regalia,</hi> which had been laid up
with all care and safety through the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
Reigns of so many Kings; The Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Crown, wherewith our Kings were u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sually
crown'd; the Robes, the Sword,
the Scepter of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor,
all forcibly plucked out from their reposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
by a pretended order, and after ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
most unworthy and unmanly abuses
(far beneath humanity as well as loyalty)
offered to those ancient (I might almost
say awful) Ensigns of Sovereignty, this
base <hi>Sarcasm</hi> was thrown out in way of
scorn, <hi>There would be no further use of these
toys and trifles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After these ominous <hi>Praeludia</hi> in <hi>Effigie,</hi>
then follows, <hi>Quis temperet à lachrymis?</hi> then
follows the real Murther and Martyrdom
of our <hi>Sovereign</hi> himself in his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son;
with whom fell likewise this ancient
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:30968:16"/>
and flourishing Government. Then was
the <hi>Royal Family</hi> it self proscrib'd and scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd.
Our Nobles, who had been brought
up in Scarlet, many of them forced then
to embrace the Dunghil. Then were the
Fields and Scaffolds so often stain'd with
noble and loyal bloud. Then were heard
those heart-breaking groans of so many ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined
Families; the deep sighings of poor
Widows and Orphans, bewailing the loss
of their dear Husbands and Fathers, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed
and cut off for no greater crime
than paying their just duty to God and
their King. Property (the choicest flower
in the Subjects Garden) was then violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
torn up. Antient and indefeasible E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states
arbitrarily taken away and sold. The
whole course of the Law, and <hi>Magna Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi>
it self, forced to strike sail to the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less
power and pleasure of some new-rais'd
<hi>Committee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>En quò discordia Cives!</hi> See, see, what <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liads</hi>
of misery our discords and tumults
brought in upon us! We would needs then
violently remove our ancient Land-marks,
and we became thenceforth inevitably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:30968:16"/>
to all this <hi>series</hi> of common calamity.</p>
            <p>Nor was the Church less tragically pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive
on her part. Our Books of publick
Liturgy, compil'd with so much decent
gravity, adapted with so much care and
prudence to general edification, confirm'd
and recommended so often by supreme
Authority; became nevertheless the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
subject of prophane sport and disdain
to the <hi>Genius</hi> of those licentious times.</p>
            <p>The blessed Sacraments (the very seals
of the Covenant of Grace, the richest trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures
in all Christian Religion) fell then
under a supine neglect and contempt.
These fair Temples dedicated to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est
ends and uses that such Structures are
capable of, the Service and Worship of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
God, his <hi>Bethels,</hi> his peculiar Houses
here on Earth, the Tabernacles of solemn
meeting between him and his people;
were then nevertheless in a kind of rage
and phrensie more wretchedly defaced
within the space of very few months, than
many years are or will be yet able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair.</p>
            <p>Our Cathedrals in some places (to the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:30968:17"/>
great affront even of Religion it self) turn'd
into beastly Stables. In other places into
Gaols, for poor, cold, starving, loyal priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners;
and no fewel allow'd them, so long as
the curious carved Wainscoat of the Choir
afforded any.</p>
            <p>The Statue of our Saviour in stone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
espied at one Cathedral, no fewer than
forty Musquet-shot were discharged at it,
and high triumphing who could hit the
head or face. The Ornaments, costly Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels
and Plate of the Church sacrilegiously
ravaged and torn away.</p>
            <p>At another Cathedral, the <hi>Chalice</hi> for the
holy <hi>Eucharist</hi> being snatcht up as spoil of
more than ordinary prize, some entreaties
were modestly made that it might have
been spared, and restored for that sacred
use; but they received no better than this
churlish answer, <hi>They might serve that turn
in a wooden dish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither might the holy Table it self,
where the Sacrament of the Body and
Bloud of our Lord and Saviour <hi>Jesus Christ</hi>
is administred, escape its share in these in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignities;
although for modesty sake, that I
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:30968:17"/>
may not contaminate any civil ears, I
must forbear the relating of them.</p>
            <p>But alas! what are these Buildings of
stone, these dead (though curious) Fabricks,
in comparison of the Living Temples, the
Ministers of God? 'Twas they who drank
so deeply of this bitter Cup; and might
now weep upon an unexpected account <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Porch and the Altar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The great City of <hi>London,</hi> and the lines
of that Communication, may be too true
a witness in this unwelcome Case: where
in a short space of time far above an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
reverend learned Divines (the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of <hi>England</hi>'s Clergy) were most illegal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and unworthily turn'd out of their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry
and lawful possessions, they and
their families, to irreparable ruine.</p>
            <p>Then followed that numerous seque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>string
of the Clergy in almost all Parts.
the ejecting and silencing such vast multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes
of worthy able Ministers. A Case
that even astonish'd many Churches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
what <hi>England</hi> was then a doing, how
these violences against Religion, and the
Ministers of it, could possibly agree with
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:30968:18"/>
(what was so much then pretended) the
promoting of the Gospel.</p>
            <p>Your selves may possible remember this
place was not without some deep sufferers
in that kind. One instance (adjoining to
our very walls) offers it self too appositely
to this sad Subject. I am almost at a loss
whether to suppress or relate so woful a
story: Bishop <hi>Howell,</hi> a Person to whose
memory all good men (who had any
knowledge of him) will ever pay a very
high respect and honour; he being in the
time of our late Wars Bishop here, his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopal
and Personal Estate both taken
from him, himself with his Wife and a nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous
Family of nine or ten Children in
the Palace, She lies in; but those who had
pretendedly bought the House, to make
sale of the Leads, uncover the room where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
She lay in Child-bed; So that the rain
and weather beating in (and it may be a
mixture of grief together with both) She
becomes carried from her Child-bed to her
Bed of Clay. Nor might this suffice, affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
is further added to the afflicted.
The distressed, disconsolate good man must
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:30968:18"/>
next be dragg'd forth: He catches hold up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Staple of the Door, loth (as it seems)
to lodge in the Fields, and scarce knowing
how or where to shelter his now poor
motherless family. With this struggling he
lingers some few days in the house, and in
less than a fortnights space, overwhelmed
with these indignities and sorrows, he dies
also, and so retires to God and Heaven as
his truest <hi>asylum,</hi> his safest retreat from all
these oppressions.</p>
            <p>So far were the very rights of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
as well as the ancient laws of the Land,
and (which is far more than either) the
sacred Precepts of Christian Religion, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned
by the phrensies which we were
then distemper'd withal. <hi>Tantum Religio po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuit
suadere malorum.</hi> 'Twas grown with
some almost a Point of Religion, to be in
these Cases inhumane and irreligious.
Scarce any thing but might be then allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
save only what the Law it self requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
what our just duty to Gods Anointed
and his Church obliged us to perform.</p>
            <p>But I must break off (though never so
abruptly) from this unpleasing Theme.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:30968:19"/>
Far be it be from us to take pleasure in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing
the wretched miscarriages of those
joyless times: The remembrance of them
may be instruction to all, delight to none.
He that is truly sensible of his deviations
then, will modestly say, (as in <hi>Job) I have
done iniquity, but will offend no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The only end why these things have
been thus mentioned is nakedly this, <hi>That
we might hear and fear, and do no more so wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
Small rushings against Government,
may by degrees bring on far greater and
sorer evils than we can at first foresee.
That may be the unhappy end of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which was not the real intention of the
Agent. No doubt, in our late confusions,
many abhorred at first what was yet done
at last. But those ill actions being once
set on foot, could not be so easily stopt;
they ran on to those fatal mischievous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequences
which became an astonishment
to all. I confess, we are easily flatter'd into
irregularities, by fond presumptions that we
could presently make all things much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
Our project, forsooth, (if we might but
try it) would infallibly heal all. But such
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:30968:19"/>
counsels prove commonly (as the <hi>Historian</hi>
has observed to our hand) <hi>Primâ specie laeta,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Livius.</note>
               <hi>tractatu dura, eventu tristia.</hi> They may seem
to begin briskly, but soon after they drive
on (as <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Chariots) more heavily,
and they always end most miserably. Thus
<hi>Absalom</hi> in his hot-brain'd insurrection men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
the matter very fairly, by ruining both
himself and multitudes with him.</p>
            <p>Whence it is that the wisdome of God
tells us,<note place="margin">Prov. 17. 14.</note> 
               <hi>The beginning of strife is as when one
letteth out water.</hi> We open <hi>Pandora</hi>'s Box.
We let loose an unruly Element. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
our care should rather be, not to stir
those floodgates, lest we be drowned in the
torrent. God hath graciously spoken peace
to us, O let not us return any more to
such folly.</p>
            <p>It were a noble posture for every man
wisely to stand upon his own guard, and
not to suffer himself to be weakly impos'd
upon, or speciously drawn aside from his
just duty toward God or man. There are
divers opinions and courses, which upon
sad observation are found to breed much
fond conceitedness of our selves, an uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:30968:20"/>
disesteem of others, a morose
sowrness of Nature, a rash cenforiousness of
Superiours, and a dangerous pragmatical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
in all our ways. For Gods sake, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
for Gods sake, let not any of your Souls
come into those Secrets, imbibe not such
feral opinions. They are as <hi>Circe</hi>'s Cup,
and will intoxicate. The Distemper once
flown up into the head, will certainly
produce irregularities in the life.</p>
            <p>I must conclude. Gentlemen, You have
willingly offered your selves to serve the
Government. You cannot but have a deep
sense of the manifold blessings we all enjoy
under it; the woful distractions we were
all exposed to by the late violences offered
to it.</p>
            <p>In Gods name, stand by this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
'Tis well worthy your highest va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour,
well worthy your truest fidelity.
Modesty it self may say, as that pious man
long since,</p>
            <q>

               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Our welfare is apparently bound up in the
welfare of the Government. There needs
no more, under God, to make us a happy

people, than honest endeavours, every one
in his proper place, for the faithful admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration
of it, whether in Church or State.
This may our Divisions hinder. This
might our love and harmony promote.
We need not then fear what Superstition
could do against us on the one hand, or
Faction on the other. He that fixeth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly
with his duty, may safely bid defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
to all the attempts of Men and Devils.</p>
            <p>Put on, I beseech you, as good <hi>Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi>

We must comport in a vertuous nobleness
