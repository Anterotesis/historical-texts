         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

inſtrumental to many for their recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.
For though thoſe Directions, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny

there is a general longing and earneſt

even in the City it ſelf aſwell as in

effectual help. It is true, that it is the
great Judgment of God which afflicts us,
our Prophaneneſs and manifold ſins, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking
the juſt Indignation of Divine
Juſtice: However, the Lord even in the
midſt of his Anger being not forgetful of
his Mercy, it behoveth both Divines and

Calamity to ſtand in the Breach, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come

oppreſs the Innocent, leſt thereby we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſperate
the Wrath kindled againſt us, but
rather aſſwage the ſame by mercy and
mildneſs. When it ſhall pleaſe God that
theſe Afflictions be over, I ſhall then
publiſh another Tract, concerning four

that the ſame is a meer falſe
ſlander and fiction, maliciouſly inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by ſome of my Profeſſion, on ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purpoſe
to divert Patients from me, and to mar my
Practice. Both my ſelf and Family are all in perfect
health, (God be praiſed for it) and I hope to live to
the comfort of my Friends, and converſion of my
Enemies. In the Pariſh where I live, there hath been
as much affliction, by the current Epidemical Diſeaſe,
as in other Pariſhes, but that by the uſe of ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
as they had from me, they eſcaped, the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty

According to the compute of the laſt weeks Bill of

and all the time before but four; which I do not
doubt but that by the help of God they might have
alſo eſcaped, if they had not been frighted from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

like a furious Lion, infeſting in the preſent Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

            </q>
            <p>There have been ſtrange and various faces of the
Heavens of late years, eſpecially this laſt, wherein
three Blazing-Stars, or Comets, appeared; the faſhion
of their appearance I need not deſcribe, it having
been obvious unto, and noted by many thouſands;
Only, it is generally agreed on, that Plagues and ſuch
like Judgments uſe to follow upon ſuch Signs. I have
made many Obſervations of the Heavens, ſince I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
ſomething of that Learning, and could
wiſh there were more frequent Obſervations made by
better Underſtandings than my own, and that the
enemies of that Learning would be more moderate,
and forbear to condemn what they are not skill'd in.
For according to the Opinion of our Phyſicians if
there be any Contagion in the Air, the ſame naturally
ſpringeth forth from the Configuration of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens;
which I will not diſcourſe of at this time, nor
trouble thy head, when thy heart ſhould mind the <hi>One
thing neceſſary.</hi> Let them that flee from the City, not
think themſelves the ſafer from the Judgment; nor
let thoſe in the Country flatter themſelves with vain
hopes: for I fear they will taſte as deeply of the Cup
of this Indignation, as thoſe in the City. It is a ſtrange
<pb facs="tcp:45226:5"/>
time, people are afraid one of another; yea, even the
beſt friends keep themſelves aloof from one another.
Yea, ſuch a ſpirit reigns all over the Country, that they
could be contented to block up all the Citizens, and
rather let them periſh than come forth into the Air to
refreſh themſelves. And therefore you which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
in the City, have great reaſon to love one
another as you are Neighbours, and to make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of convenient places, where no body can reſiſt
you; as alſo of fit means, and able men, that may
make it their buſineſs to ſtudy your preſervation. You
plainly ſee, that this grievous Diſeaſe not only endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gereth
your Lives, but alſo your Repute and Trading,
and marreth your Fortunes, inſomuch that you loſe
that eſteem and courtſhip which you were wont to
have from thoſe that wanted your goods and moneys;
yea, thoſe that flattered you, do now frown upon you
and ſcarce own you. All which might be eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied,
and your Reputation and Trading preſerved,
if you pleaſed but to conſider of it, and love one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other,
and take counſel of ſuch as are able to adviſe.
For which end I could wiſh, that there might be cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen
a ſelect number of perſons, to adviſe and direct to
the beſt means conducing to this purpoſe, in regard
that the old and ordinary courſes fall far ſhort of what
may be deviſed and adviſed. I make no queſtion but
that having been a Practitioner in Phyſick in this City
theſe fifteen years, I may be credited concerning the
things I propoſe; for, whoever tryeth my Medicines,
will find them ſpeak for themſelves, and need no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
commendation from my ſelf or any one elſe. The
Ingredients of the Medicines here offered are no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
<pb facs="tcp:45226:6"/>
though chymically prepared, and I do aſſure
thee that they are very ſafe even before they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.
<hi>Chymical</hi> Medicines have been ever, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
now at this time, found ſo neceſſary, and beyond
the ordinary uſual Medicines, that the Phyſicians of
the Colledge themſelves have given order for prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
of a Chymical Medicine to <hi>Johnſon</hi> their Chymiſt
in <hi>Amen-corner.</hi> In the next Book which I do intend
to put forth, I ſhall give an account of my Riſe and
Pedigree, and how I came to the atchievment of theſe
things which I now profeſs, the late infortunate times
obſtructing me from aſpiring to variety of Languages
and other Acquirements, which elſe I might have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed.
How-ever, as to my Abilities in what I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
my Practice and Succeſſes upon my Patients will
ſpeak ſufficiently on my behalf. And I would have
thee take notice, that my Medicines proved very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial
to divers that came out of Priſon this laſt Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
where I ſuppoſe (as my Obſervations upon the

ſelf by breaking your faſt, and filling your
Stomach (ſo far as you can endure it)
with any convenient Food, drinking af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
it a draught of ſmall Beer, mixt with
two or three drops of true Oyle of Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,
ſuch as is not ſophiſticated, or elſe ſix drops to twelve
of the true Spirit of Salt.</p>
            <p>2. Carry about you a Ball, made of Tobacco-leaf, roll'd
up and tyed in ſome Tiffiny or Lawn, and ſo dipt in Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar:

its fourth part of Flower of Sulphur, and ſeven or eight drops
of Oyl of Amber for one Pipe, and take three ſuch Pipes

a glaſs of Canary, perfumed with the Smoak of Brimſtone,
which is to be done as followeth:</p>
            <p>Take Flower of Brimſtone, melt it in an earthen pan, dip
therein ſome pieces of Packthred, or ſmall wooden ſticks,
that they be covered over with the Brimſtone, which reſerve

Canary, turn it with the nozel downwards: light your
Match or piece of Packthred, or wooden ſtick covered over
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:45226:7"/>
with Brimſtone, and thruſt it up into the nozel, that the ſmoak
may aſcend up into the bottle; and when the ſame is filled
with ſmoak, ſo that it will receive no more (the ſign whereof
is when it bloweth out the fire of the Match); then take out
your Match, and thruſt up a Funnel, and turn the Glaſs, and
fill it half full of Canary, and having taken out the Funnel,
quickly ſtop the orifice of the Glaſs with your hand, and ſhake
it up and down until it hath drunk up the ſmoak. Then ſtop
the Glaſs cloſe, and keep it for your uſe as above directed.</p>
            <p>5. Be ſure to ſmoke all the Rooms of your Houſe every
day twice or thrice with Brimſtone, uſing half an ounce of it
at a time, more or leſs, according to the bigneſs of the houſe,
and as far as you can endure it, keeping the Brimſtone burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with Coals kindled in an earthen Chafing-diſh or pan, or
with a red-hot Iron; for this cleareth the Air from Infection
above any thing elſe: And though by ſome Pretenders the
Brimſtone be altered by the addition of ſomething elſe, yet
the Sulphur (as it is of it ſelf) being beſt, that alteration ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth
nothing elſe but to conceal it from the vulgar, and to
make them pay dear for that which they may have at a cheap
rate; for they ſhall certainly find the Brimſtone alone of it
ſelf to do as well, yea rather better than the other.</p>

               <head>Directions for the Cure of thoſe that are infected.</head>
               <p>You may know the coming of the Diſeaſe upon you by a
ſqueamiſhneſs of the ſtomach, faintings, giddineſs in the
head, yea an univerſal conſternation of all the faculties and
functions of your body. Which when you perceive, take in
hand theſe Medicines following, and you will be infallibly
cured (by the bleſſing of God) with two doſes, yea ſometimes
with one (as it hath often hapned with many) unleſs there
be an extraordinary Commiſſion from Divine Vengeance to
the contrary, which is in no Medicines power to reſiſt.</p>
               <p>1. So ſoon as you find your ſelf ill, take of the clear white
Liquor ſo much as is contained in one Glaſs, ſealed up with
a red thred, and the letters <hi>R. B.</hi> pour it out in a ſilver or
earthen diſh, or in a drinking-glaſs, and drink it off leiſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and then lay your ſelf down, and within a quarter or half
an hour you will find its operation either by ſtool, urine,
ſweat, vomit, bleeding at the noſe; ſometimes by moſt, and
ſometimes by all theſe: which operations either by all, or
one, or ſome of them, are a certain ſign of your Cure. This
proportion is for a man or woman at age, but to one of twelve
years old give but half a glaſs; to a child but a quarter, and
ſo proportionably according to their ſeveral ages.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Note,</hi> that when you have taken this Medicine, and ſuſpect
that it may come up again, then hold in your mouth a bit of
Sugar-candy, or any other thing you like beſt.</p>
               <p>2. Three hours after the operation, let them take half a
ſpoonful, or one ſpoonful of the above-mentioned <hi>Elixir
vitae;</hi> which though it be mark'd with the ſame letters, and
ſealed up after the faſhion of the former Medicine, yet you
may know it by the colour, it being towards an orange.</p>
               <p>3. Twelve hours after the taking of the firſt doſe of the
white Liquor, let him <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ke the ſecond half; and again twelve
hours after, another <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap>; which in all will be two whole
doſes.</p>
               <p>4. When the Patient hath a drowth, let him take ſome
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45226:8"/>
ſmall Beer warm'd, in his mouth, and ſpit it out again. But
in caſe neceſſity forceth him to drink, let him take Poſſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drink
wherein Dandelion hath been boyled, with two or
three drops of Spirit of Sulphur, or ſix of Spirit of Salt put
into it. And let him be ſure to keep himſelf warm, not only
for that day, but alſo the dayes following; for its operation
will hold on divers dayes after, till he find himſelf well.</p>
               <p>5. In caſe he ſhould throw up the Medicine preſently, or
before a quarter of an hour (after the taking of it) be paſt, let
him take another doſe preſently. And in caſe you judge, that
it be not all come up, then give him but half another Glaſs
or Doſe, and twelve hours after the other half.</p>
               <p>Theſe Medicines being ſo rare and infallible in their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
all Maſters of Families will do well to provide ſome
quantity of them in time, that they may have them in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and be not to ſeek for it in time of need; for they are
ſuch Jewels for the recovery and preſervation of health, as
there can be no better; and all circumſtances well conſidered;
they are the cheapeſt Medicines they can buy for this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of Salt (not that dropſical one, uſhe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Both of them mightily reſiſt putrifaction.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of Salt is diuretick and very balſamick, and of
excellent uſe in moſt Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of Sulphur is the <hi>Soboles</hi> of a moſt pure Vitriol
contained in the Sulphur, which the ſame robb'd from the
<hi>Venerial Marcaſite</hi> or Oar, when it was melted and ſevered
from it. It is both diuretick and diaphoretick, and mightily
ſtrentheneth the Stomach; and as it reſiſteth all putrifaction,
and what ariſeth therefrom, ſo it killeth the Worms, preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth
from the Scurvy, and all other diſeaſes that have their
riſe from putrifaction, and ſo cauſeth life to hold on to a
great age, the party living temperately, and uſing it two drops
twice a day in a little draught of ſmall Beer. Many other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions

to a very great age, to the wonder of all men. I do give you
