            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>MY LORDS,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Did lately move your Lordſhips that
the breach of the <hi>pacification</hi> might be
ſpeedily reviewed as the <hi>unum neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium;</hi>
and truly my opinion at that
time is yet nothing altered, although upon better
thoughts (me thinkes) it would firſt be known who
did actually engage us in theſe fruitleſſe diſſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and ſo derive the miſchiefe from ſome origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall.
For <hi>my Lords,</hi> the Kingdome cannot now long
ſtand at gaze or undergoe new burthens.</p>
            <p>Wherefore what is to be done (if you intend it
ſhould proſper) muſt preſently receive life from
the whole people, otherwiſe wee ſhall expire in a
dreame; and when the ſucceſſe differs from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
it is not enough to cry, <hi>quod non putaram.
My Lords,</hi> the wiſe-man ſaies, there is a proper ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
for all things under the Sun, and we often find
the experiment in naturall bodies, which are volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
weakened, to recover ſtrength, yet with a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction
to ſuch bounds, and limits, as the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
preſcribes himſelfe, and truly, I thinke it is your
Lordſhips caſe at this point, either to conſider
what ſhould further be done then is already, or
elſe how to get out of thoſe labyrinths we now are
in, leſt the words of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> come home to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97296:3"/>
our ſelves <hi>Vendidiſti populum ſine pretio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> I am confident the houſe of Commons
doth throughly ſee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> both into the prejudice, &amp; vaſt
expence that theſe 2. Armies lay upon the land, and
undoubtedly ſo many. Gentlemen of worth, as ſit
there, will have tender eyes upon the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weale.
It will therefore become your Lordſhips to
ſecond them in your way, and whilſt they apply to
publique wounds; the care of this houſe may ſearch
the inteſtines, for if they be not clenſed, it will be
but a ſuperficiall Cure, and breake out againe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords,</hi> it ſeemes the Earle of <hi>Strafford,</hi> and the
Archbiſhop of <hi>Cant.</hi> have gone the high wayes of
iniquity, and every one knowes how to trace them,
but Mines under ground are moſt conſiderable,
which (unleſſe they be likewiſe found out) may at
any time ſpring and ſupprant the whole fabrick of
all our labours. Let us then examine this fantaſtick
warre <hi>ab initio;</hi> leſt, as the Duke of <hi>Burgundy</hi> made
a few Sheepskins y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> cauſe of his quarrell, ſo we ſhall
find thoſe few ſheets of paper, ſent under the name
of a <hi>Liturgy,</hi> and booke of <hi>Canons,</hi> were but the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pſas</hi>
of the ſtory to divert our eyes from the maine
deſigne.</p>
            <p>Therfore my humble motion ſhall be for a ſelected
Committee of no great number, who may have
power from the Houſe to begin <hi>ab origine mali,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe
every mans negotiations, who was either an
Actor or Counſellor ſince the firſt appearance of
thoſe troubles in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and that they may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Counſell upon ſuch Articles, as
the heavy preſſure of this Kingdome ſhall upon
common fame adminiſter unto them.</p>

ANDEVERS
SPEECH concerning
the <hi>Starre-chamber.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>My Lords,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>SInce your Lordſhips have already looked ſo
farre into the Priviledges of Peeres, as to
make a ſtrict inquiſition upon forraine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,
let us not deſtroy that amongſt our ſelves,
which we deſire to preſerve from ſtrangers.</p>
            <p>And if this grievance I ſhall move againe have
ſlept till now, it is very conſiderable, leſt cuſtome
make it every day more apparent then other. Your
Lordſhips very well know there was a Statute fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the 30. <hi>H.</hi> 7. authoriſing the Chancellour,
Treaſurer, Privy Seale, and the 2. chiefe Iuſtices,
calling to them one Biſhop, and a Temporall Lord
of the Kings Counſell to receive complaints upon
Bill or information, and cite ſuch parties to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare
as ſtand accuſed of any miſdemeanors, and
this was the infancie of the <hi>Starchamber.</hi> But af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
Cardinall <hi>Wolſey. 8. Hen.</hi> 8. raiſed it to
mans eſtate, from whence (being now altogether
unlimited) 'tis growne a Monſter, and will houre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:97296:4"/>
produce worſe effects, unleſſe it be reduced by
that hand which layd the foundation, for the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
that are ratified by Parliament admit of no
other remedy then an appeale.</p>
            <p>Therefore I humbly offer unto your Lordſhips
theſe enſning ſeaſons why it ſhould be repealed,
Firſt that the very words of the. Stature cleerely
ſhew it was a needleſſe in<gap reason="illegible: bleedthrough" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>itution, for it ſayes, they
who are to judge can proceed with no delinquent,
otherwiſe the if he were convict of the ſame crime
by due proceſſe of Law, and doe your Lordſhips
hold this a rationall Court that ſends us to the
Law and calls us backe from it againe? Secondly,
divers judicatories confound one another, <hi>&amp; in peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſima
Republica plurimae leges,</hi> this 2. reaſon is from
<hi>Circumſtance,</hi> or rather <hi>a conſuitudine,</hi> and of this
there are many examples, both <hi>domeſtike and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne,</hi>
but more particularly by the Parliaments of <hi>France</hi>
abbreviated into a ſtanding <hi>Committee</hi> by
<hi>Philip</hi> the Long, and continued according to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
untill <hi>Lewis</hi> the 11. came unto the Crowne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>who
being a ſubtill Prince burned the volume in,
the Epitome, for to this day when ever the 3. eſtates
are called, either at the death of the old King, or to
Crowne the new, it is a Common Proverbe, <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons
voire gen des eſtates. My Lords,</hi> Arbitrary judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
deſtroy the Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon Lawes, and in the 2. great
Charters of the Kingdome, which being once loſt,
we have nothing elſe left but the name of libertie.
The laſt reaſon is (though it was the firſt cauſe of
my ſtanding up) the great Eclipſe that it hath e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
beene to the whole Nobility, for who are ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:97296:4"/>
vexed there as Peeres and Noblemen, and
notwithſtanding their appeale to this aſſembly is
ever good, whileſt the famous Law of 4. <hi>Ed.</hi> 3.
remaines in force for the holding of a Parliament
once a yeare, or more often, if occaſion require, yet
who durſt a yeare agoe mention ſuch a Statute
without incurring the danger of Mr. <hi>Kilverts</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution?</p>
            <p>Therefore ſhall humbly move your Lordſhips,
that a ſelect Committes of a few may be named
to conſider of the Act of Parliament it ſelfe, and
if they ſhall thinke it of as great prejudice as doe,
that then the Houſe of Commons in the uſuall
manner may be made acquainted with it either by
Bill or conference, who may happily alſo thinke it
a burthen to the ſubject, and ſo when the whole
body of Parliament ſhall joyne in one ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
I am confident his Majeſtie vvill deſire that
nothing ſhould remaine in force vvhich
his people doe not vvillingly
obey.</p>
