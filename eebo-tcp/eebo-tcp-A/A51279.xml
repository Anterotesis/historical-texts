            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

that it is now very hardly to be found; though ſome haue ſeene it of late.

yourſelfe vvith the bookes of ancient Authours, which if you meaſure by the profitt you haue taken by them, ſurely you haue alreadie accomplished your taske; but if by affection, then you vvill neuer bring your ſayd purpoſe to a perfect ende.

He tooke a felicitie to ſett out ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie Commentaries vpon the Fathers workes, cenſuring them at his pleaſure, for which cauſe he is tearmed <hi>Errans mus</hi>; becauſe he wandreth here and there in other mens harueſts; yea in his writings he is ſayd to haue hatched manie of

he ſeemeth in doubtfull words to taxe the Church with ſuperſtition, and the new Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall bretheren with impietie.</p>
               <p>Now to conclude this matter of Sir THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS MORE's friends, lett vs heare what <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſpeaketh of him in an epiſtle to <hi>Vlderick Hut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten:</hi>

accuſed of his fact, ſayd that he would excuſe himſelfe ſufficiently, if he were but permitted in priuate to ſpeake to ſome one of the Benche; he was bidde therefore to chooſe one whome he would; and he preſently choſe that graue olde man, who then had his pouche at his gyrdle; and whilſt he roundeth him in the eare, he cunningly cutts his purſe; and taking his leaue ſollemnely, goeth downe to his place; Sir THOMAS knowing by a ſigne that it was diſpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, taketh preſently an occaſion to moue all the Bench to diſtribute ſome almes vpon a poore needie fellowe, that was there, beginning himſelfe to do it.

you ſay, and going through all eſtates with his comme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dations of them, he went farre beyond my vncle; and yet ſonne, quoth he, I pray God, that ſome of vs, as high as wee ſeeme to ſitt now vpon the mountaines, treading heretikes vnder our feete like antes, doe not liue the day that we gladly would wish to be in league with them, to ſuffer them to haue their chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches quietly to themſelues, ſo that they would he content to lett vs haue ours peaceably to our ſelues. VVhen mine vncle <hi>Rooper</hi> had tolde him manie reaſons, why he had no cauſe to ſay ſo; well, ſayd he, I pray God ſome of vs liue not till that day; and yet shewed he noe reaſon for all theſe his ſpeaches<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereat my vncle ſayd in a choller: By my troath Sir it is very deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tely ſpoken; I cry God mercie (ſaith my vncle) I vſed vnto him that very word. By which ſpeach Sir THOMAS perceauing him to be ſomewhat angrie, ſayd merrily<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> well ſonne <hi>Rooper,</hi> it shall not be ſo, it shall not be ſo. But yet himſelf founde the predictio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> too true: for he liued vntil the fiueteenth yeare of Q. <hi>Elizabeth's</hi> raigne,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98618:81"/>
when he ſaw religion turned topſie turuie, and no hope of anie amendement.</p>
               <p>This ſpiritt of prophecie no doubt was a ſigne of Gods loue vnto Sir THOMAS,<note place="margin">4.

For when <hi>M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. VVilliam Rooper</hi> was a yong man, he vſed auſteritie to himſelfe more then diſcretion afforded; and by this meanes he grew wearie of the Catholike faſts and religious diſcipline; and hearing of a new and eaſie way to heauen, which the preachers of nouelties did promiſe to their followers, he beganne to reade diligently the bookes of hereſies, which came ouer, and were ſpread in euerie place of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland; in ſo much that being wearie of Auricu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Confeſſion, faſting the lent, and vigiles, he grew vehement in his new opinions, and zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in breaking of them to others; ſo as that he would be alwaies talking, what a readie way to
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98618:82"/>
heauen was now found out, no bodie needing to ſue to Saints or mens prayers; but Gods eare was open ſtill to heare, and his mercie readie to forgiue anie ſinner whatſoeuer, when he shall call to him by fayth, which was only neceſſarie to ſaluation; and hauing that only, which he aſſured himſelf of, he needed not doubt, but that he was an elect and ſaued ſoule, ſo that it was impoſſible for him to ſinne or fall out of God's fauour.<note place="margin">The hot ſpirit of hereſy.</note> Of this dangerous poiſon of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curitie he hauing druncke a full draught, he came on a time to Sir THOMAS to requeſt him, becauſe he was highly in the king's fauour, that he would gett him a licence to preache, what the ſpiritt had taught him; for he was aſſured that God had ſent him to inſtruct the world; not knowing (god wote) anie reaſon of this his miſſion, but only his priuate ſpirit; to whome Sir THOMAS in a ſmiling manner replyed; Is it not ſufficient, ſonne <hi>Rooper,</hi> that we that are your frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ds should knowe that you are a foole, but that you would haue your follie proclamed to the world? After this he often diſputed with
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98618:82"/>
him about matters of religion, yet neuer could he bring him to hearken to anie reaſon, euerie day ſeeming more obſtinate then other, vntill at length he ſayd: in ſober ſadneſſe: I ſee, ſonne, noe diſputation will doe thee good; henceforth therefore I will diſpute with thee no more; on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will I pray for thee, that God will be ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable as to touch thy hart; and ſo commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him to God, they parted. And he earneſtly powred out his deuotions before the Diuine mercie for that intent. And beholde my vncle not long after being inſpired with the light of grace, beganne to deteſt his hereſies; and, as an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <hi>S.

for both of them beare name of a reaſonable crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture equally, vvhoſe nature reaſon only doth di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguish from bruite beastes, and therefore I do not ſee vvhy learning in like manner may not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually agree vvith both ſexes; for by it, reaſon is cultiuated, and (as a fielde) ſovved vvith vvhole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome precepts, it bringeth forth excellent fruit.

Hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I expect euerie day letters from euerie one of you; neither vvill I accept of ſuch excuſes, as you complaine of, that you had no leaſure, or that the Carrier vvent avvay ſuddenly, or that you haue no matter to vvrite</hi>; Iohn <hi>is not vvont to alleage anie ſuch things; nothing can hinder you from vvriting, but manie things may exhort you thereto vvhy should you lay anie faulte vpon the

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow lett vs ſee, what moſt of the learned men of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, not only Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholikes but euen Proteſtants thought and wrote of king <hi>He<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rie</hi> for Sir THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS MORE's death, who were not likelie, being free from all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tialitie, but to ſpeake their mindes ſincerely, not fearing him as his ſubiects, nor hating him for anie priuate reſpects. Firſt Cardinall <hi>Pole</hi> then liuing in the Courte of <hi>Rome,</hi> and writing to the king in the defence of Eccleſiaſticall vnitie, ſayth thus by the figure of Apoſtraphe, of the complaints of other men: Thy father, Oh En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, thy ornament, thy defence, was brought
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:98618:186"/>
to his death, being innocent in thy ſight; by birth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> thy childe; by condition, thy Cittizen, but thy father for the manie benefits donne vnto thee; for he shewed more euident ſignes of his fatherlie loue towards thee, then euer anie louing father hath expreſſed to his onlie and truly beloued childe; yet in nothing hath he more declared his fatherlie affection, then by his ende, for that he left his life for thy ſake; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially leaſt he should ouerthrowe and betray thy ſaluation. Wherefore that which we reade in the ancient ſtories of <hi>Greece,</hi> as touching <hi>Socrates,</hi> whome the <hi>Athenians</hi> condemned moſt vniuſtly to take poyſon, ſo thou haſt now ſeene thy <hi>Socrates</hi> beheaded before thine eies; a while after his death when in a playe there was recited out of a Tragedie theſe wordes: You haue ſlayne, you haue ſlayne the beſt man of all <hi>Greece.</hi> Vpon theſe their words euerie man ſo lamented the death of <hi>Socrates,</hi> calling to minde that iniuſtice, although the Poet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe dreamed leaſt of him, that the whole theater was filled with nothing elſe, but teares

and howling, for which cauſe the people pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently reuenged his death, by punishing grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly the chiefe authours thereof; thoſe that were of them to be found, were putt to death preſently, and they that could not be found out, were banished. There was alſo a ſtatua ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in his honour, in the verie markett place. Yf they therefore at the only hearing of theſe wordes vpon the ſtadge tooke an occaſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to be reuenged of that moſt innocent man's ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; what more iuſt cauſe mayſt thou, <hi>London,</hi> haue of compaſſion and reuenge, hearing the like words to theſe, not pronounced only by anie ſtage-player at home, but by moſt graue and reuerende men in all places of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, when as they ſpeake moſt ſeriouſly, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrating often vnto thee thine ingratitude, &amp; ſaying: You haue ſlayne, you haue ſlayne the beſt English-ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> aliue.

Eraſmus of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terdam.</note>2. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> (as may be eaſily gueſſed by the ſtile) although he wrote it not in his owne name, becauſe he had then manie friends in England, ſayth thus: This is Euident, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther MORE nor the Bishopp of <hi>Rochester</hi> erred (yf they haue erred at all) of any malice they had againſt the king, but for ſincere conſcience ſake; This they perſwaded themſelues wholy, this was infixed in their marrowes, that the matter which they defended, was good and lawfull and honourable for the king, and hole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome for all the whole kingdome: Yf it had bene lawfull for them to haue diſſembled it, they would haue donne it willingly; but they tooke their death moſt patiently &amp; peaceably, praying to God for the king and the whole realme's ſafetie. In haynous offences a ſimple and pure conſcience, and a minde not deſirous of hurting anie, but of well deſeruing, excuſeth much the faulte; beſides due reſpect &amp; honour

hath bene alwaies had euen, amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt barbarous nations, to eminent learning and excellent ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. The verie name of a philoſopher reſcued <hi>Plato</hi> from being beheaded by the <hi>Aeginetes,</hi> hauing tranſgreſſed the lawes of their Cittie. <hi>Diogenes</hi> without anie feare came into <hi>Philipp</hi> king of <hi>Macedonia's</hi> armie, and being brought before him for a ſpye of their enemies, freely reproched the king to his face of madneſſe, that being not content with his owne kingdome, he would caſt himſelfe into danger to leeſe all; yet was he ſent away without anie harme at all donne to him: and not only ſo, but had a great rewarde giuen him for no other cauſe, but that he was a philoſopher. And as the courteſies of Monarches shewed vnto learned men, doe gett them greate fame, ſo to haue vſed ſuch men hardly, hath bene occaſion, that they haue bene much hated and enuied.

But euerie man bewayleth the death of Sir THOMAS MORE, euen they who are aduerſaries vnto him for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; ſo great was his courteſie to all men, ſo great his affabilitie, ſo excellent was his nature, Whome did he euer ſende away from him, yf

he were anie thing learned, without guifts? or who was ſo gregt a ſtranger vnto him, whome he did not ſeeke to doe one good turne or other? Manie are fauourable only to their owne countriemen; Frenchmen to Frenchmen, Scottishmen to Scotts. This his bountie hath ſo engrauen MORE in euerie man's hart, that they all lamente his death, as the loſſe of their owne father or brother; I myſelfe haue ſeene manie teares come from thoſe men, who neuer ſaw MORE in their liues, nor neuer receaued anie benefitt from him; yea whilſt I write theſe things teares gushe from me, whether I will or no.

For <hi>Liuie</hi> ſaith, that he had a ſower carriadge, and a toung immoderate free and full of taunting: But Sir THOMAS being <hi>Christ's</hi> ſchollar, and not anie Stoick's, was milde and of an humble hart, neither ſadde, nor turbulent, and beſides of a pleaſant conuerſation, neuer ſterne, but for righteouſneſſe; a great contemner either of vnlawfull pleaſures, or of inordinate riches and glorie. As <hi>Cato</hi> had much enmitie with diuerſe Senatours, ſo manie of them on the other ſide did exerciſe his patience, that one can hardly diſcerne, whether the Nobilitie did preſſe him more, or he the Nobilitie; but on the contrarie ſide Sir THOMAS MORE neuer had anie, priuate or publike quarrell with anie man; yea no man can reckon anie to haue bene his enemie, being borne wholy to friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipp and affabilitie; wherefore being nothing inferiour to <hi>Cato</hi> for grauitie, integritie, and

innocency, as exact a hater of all vice, and ſterne to all wicked men, as he, yet did he farre excelle him in mildeneſſe, ſweeteneſſe of behauiour and pleaſantneſſe of witt; yea I doe him iniurie to compare him to anie morall phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher whatſoeuer; for he was abſolutely well ſeene in the ſchoole of Chriſt, &amp; endewed with all ſupernaturall perfections, a greate Saint of Chriſt's Church and a holie Martyr of his fayth, and high in Gods fauour; which was well teſtifyed in his daughter my aunte <hi>Dauney,</hi> who being ſore ſick of that diſeaſe, of which she after dyed, fell into a lo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g traunce, and afterwards returning to herſelfe, she pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed with abundance of teares, that she had felt in that while moſt grieuous torments, and should haue ſuffered them for euer, had not her fathers prayers and interceſſion begged of God a little longer ſpace to repente her of her former life.

               <p>About this time there was one that had made a booke of the Spiritualtie and the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraltie,<note place="margin">The pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> of which booke the bretheren made greate ſtore, and blamed Sir THOMAS MORE, that he had not in writing vſed ſuch a ſofte and milde manner, and ſuch indifferent fashion, as the ſame perſon did.<note place="margin">Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>futed by Sir T.M.</note> By which occaſion Sir THOMAS MORE diſcourſeth vpon the ſame booke, the authour whereof pretendeth to make a pacification of the aforeſayd diuiſion and diſcorde, and openeth manie faultes and follies and falſe ſlaunders againſt the Clergie vnder a holie concluſion and pretence of paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in the ſayd bookes. To which diſcourſe of Sir THOMAS MORE's there came an anſwer afterwards in printe vnder the title of <hi>Salem</hi> and <hi>Bizanze</hi>; to the which Sir THOMAS MORE replyed, and ſo dreſſed this prettie proper poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike pacifyer, that he had no liſt,<note place="margin">The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellation of Salem and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance.</note> nor anie man for him afterwards to encounter with the ſayd Sir THOMAS MORE. The pleaſant and wittie
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:98618:213"/>
declaration of the title of the ſayd booke of Sir THOMAS MORE's, becauſe the booke is ſeldome and rare to be gott, I will now, gentle reader, ſett before thine eies. The ſayd title is framed in this ſorte: The debellation of <hi>Salem</hi> and <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanze</hi> ſometime two greate townes, which being vnder the Turke were betweene Eaſter and Michelmas laſt 1533. by a maruelous me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſe and enchantment turned into Englishmen, by the wonderfull inuentiue witt and witchcraft of <hi>Sir Iohn Someſay</hi> the Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyer, and ſo conueyed by him hither in a dialo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue to defende his diuiſion, againſt Sir THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS MORE knight; but now being thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene <hi>Michelmas</hi> and <hi>Allhallovvntide</hi> next enſuing the debellation vanquished, they are fledde hence, and are become two townes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine with theſe olde names changed <hi>Salem</hi> into <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> and <hi>Bizanze</hi> into <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> the one in <hi>Greece,</hi> the other in <hi>Syria,</hi> where they may ſee them that will, and winne them that can: and yf this Pacifyer conuey the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hither againe, and ten ſuch townes embatteled
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:98618:213"/>
with them in Dialogues, Sir THOMAS MORE hath vndertaken to putt himſelfe in aduenture againſt them all; but yf he lett them tarrie ſtill there, he will not vtterly forſweare it, but he is not in the minde, age now coming on, and he waxing vnweldie, to goe thither to giue the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulte to ſuch wellwalled townes, without ſome ſuch luſtie companie, as shalbe likelie to leape vt a little more lightly. This is the title of the aforeſayd booke; and that indeede Sir THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS MORE hath moſt valiantly diſcomfited the Pacifyer and ouerthrowen his two great townes, may eaſily appeare to ſuch as will vouchſafe to reade Sir THOMAS MORE's anſwer; the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and particularities whereof to ſett downe, would make our preſent treatiſe to growe too bigg; I will only shew you one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration or two, whereby you may make ſome ayme to iudge of the whole doing of the ſayd Pacifyer; yf it were ſo,<note place="margin">How the Pacifier reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth points in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſy.</note> ſayth the ſayd Sir THO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAS MORE, that one found two men ſtanding togeather, and would ſteppein betweene the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and beare them in hand, that they were about
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:98618:214"/>
to fight, and would with the word, putt one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie backe, with his hand, and all to buffett the other about the face, and then goe forth and ſay, he had parted a fray, and pacifyed the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ſome men would ſay as I ſuppoſe, he had as lief his enemie were lett alone with him, and thereof abide the aduenture, as haue ſuch a frie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſteppe in to parte them. Another, of a man, that were angrie with his wife, and happely not without cauſe; now ſayth Sir THOMAS MORE, yf the authour of this booke would take vpon him to reconcile them, and helpe to make the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at one, and therein would vſe this way, that when he had them both togeather before him, would tell all the faultes of the wife, and ſett a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, ſome of his owne imagination, &amp; then would goe about to auoyde his wordes vnder the fayre figure of <hi>Some</hi>-ſay; which he commonly vſeth in his booke of Pacifyng ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by forgettfullneſſe, or by the figure of playne follie; &amp; then would tell her husband's parte-verſe too, and ſay vnto him, that he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe had not dealt diſcreetely with her, but
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:98618:214"/>
hath vſed to make her too homelie with him, &amp; hath ſuffered her to be idle, and hath giuen way to her being too much co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uerſant amongſt her goſſips, and hath giuen her ouergay geare, and ſometimes giuen her euill wordes, and called, her as I ſuppoſe, curſed queane and shrewe, and ſome ſay that behinde your backe, she calles you knaue and Cuckolde, were not there a proper kinde of pacification; And yet is this the liuelie patterne and image of M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyer's doings, with the which, and with the ſpinning of fine lyes with flaxe, fetching them out of his owne bodie, as the ſpyder doth the Cobbewebbe, fayning and finding faulte with Sir THOMAS MORE for theſe matters and wordes, whereof he ſayth the playne contrarie, he had greate cauſe to be ashamed, howbeit litle shame could cleaue to his cheekes, but that he would ſoone shake it away, while his name was not at his booke.</p>
               <p>We haue now one booke more written in matter of religion, and that is of the B.<note place="margin">Sir T. M. his book of the bleſſed Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the altar, by the ſayd Sir THOMAS MORE.
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:98618:215"/>
We tolde you before of a letter of his, wherein he impugneth the hereſie of <hi>Iohn Frith</hi>; albeit he was priſonner in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> he found the meanes to make anſwer to that let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and to conuey it beyond the ſeas, where it was printed, and it was afterwards brought into this realme, as Sir THOMAS MORE, did certainely vnderſtande, who minded, when the booke came to his hands, to anſwer it; but now in the meane ſeaſon came there from beyond the ſeas, an Anſwere made to the ſame letter by another, and printed without the Authour's name entituled: The Supper of the Lord. But I beshrewe,<note place="margin">The he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retiks ſupper of the Lord, wants the beſt dishe.</note> quoth Sir THOMAS MORE, ſuch a Sewer, that ſerueth in ſuch a ſupper, as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyeth away the beſt dish, and bringeth it not to the borde, as this man would, if he could co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueye from the B Sacrament Chriſt's owne flesh and bloud, and leaue vs no thing there in but for a memoriall only bare bread and wine. But his handes are too lumpish, and this meſſe too great for him, eſpecially to conuey cleane, ſith the man hath his hart bent thereto, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:98618:215"/>
his eye ſett thereon, to ſee where it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh. This naughtie nameleſſe authour, Sir THOMAS MORE doth not only by the authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of the Sacred Scripture, and holie ancient Fathers, but by his owne reaſons and textes that himſelf bringeth forth, plainely and eui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently conuince.</p>
               <p>Now haue we beſides,<note place="margin">Sir Tho. Mores bookes written in the tower. Comfort in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Of Co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion. Of the Paſsion.</note> other excellent and fruitfull bookes, which he made being priſoner in the Tower: as his Three bookes of Comfort in Tribulation; a Treatiſe to receaue the B.

And as for heathen, I doe this worthie man plaine iniurie, and doe much
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:98618:216"/>
abaſe him, in matching and comparing him with them, eſpecially in this poynt: ſeing that, were they otherwise neuer ſo incomparable, they lacked yet and knewe not the very eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall and principall ground of Comfort and Conſolation, that is, the true ſayth of Chriſt, in whome and for whome, and whoſe glorie we muſt ſeeke and fetche all our true comfort and conſolation; well lett them paſſe, and lett vs further ſay, that as the ſayd Sir THOMAS MORE notably paſſeth manie learned Chriſtians, that haue of the ſame matter written before, ſo lett vs adde, that it may well be doubted, all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters conſidered and weighed, yf anie of the reſt may ſeeme much to paſſe him: There is in theſe bookes ſo wittie, pithie and ſubſtantiall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, for the eaſying, and remedying, and patie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuffering of all manner or griefes and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, that may poſſibly en comber anie man by anie manner or kinde of tribulatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, whether their tribulation proceede from anie inward temptation, or ghoſtlie enemie, the diuell, or anie outward temptation of the world, threate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning

to bereaue or ſpoile vs of our goods, lande, honour, libertie and freedome, by grieuous &amp; sharpe impriſonment, and finally of our life withall, by anie painefull, exquiſite and cruell death; againſt all which he doth ſo wonderfully and effectually prepare, defende, and arme the reader that a man cannot deſire or wishe anie thing of any more efficacie or importa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto to be added;<note place="margin">The ſaid book a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which he did for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee.</note> In the which booke his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall drift and ſcope was to ſtirre and prepare the mindes of Englishmen manfully and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragiouſly to withſtande and not to shrinke at the imminent and open perſecution, which he foreſawe, and immediately followed againſt the vnitie of the Church and the Catholike Fayth of the ſame; albeit full wittily and wiſely, that the bookes might the ſafer goe abroad, he doth not expreſſely meddle with thoſe matters; and couereth the matter vnder the name of an <hi>Hungarian,</hi> and of the perſecution of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kes in <hi>Hungarie</hi>; and of the booke tranſlated out of the Hungarian toung into Latine,<note place="margin">Written when he had no book about him.</note> and then into the English toung. Of theſe bookes
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:98618:217"/>
then there is great account to be made, not only for the excellent matter compriſed in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, but alſo for that they were made, when he was moſt ſtraytely shutt vpp and encloſed from all co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>panie in the Tower: in which ſorte I doubte whether a man shall finde anie other booke of like worthineſſe made by anie Chriſtian; and yet yf anie ſuch be found, much Surely should I yeelde to the ſame.<note place="margin">Written with cole</note> But there is one thing, wherein theſe bookes of Sir THOMAS MORE by ſpeciall prerogatiue ſurmounte (or elſe I am deceaued) all other of this ſorte: and that is, that they were for the moſt parte written with noe other pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ne, then a coale, as was his treatiſe vpon the Paſſion; which Coppies, yf ſome men had them, they might &amp; would eſteeme more then other bookes written with golden letters, and would no leſſe accounte of it, then S.

And yet is there one thing, that in the valuing and prayſing of theſe bookes, he is
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:98618:217"/>
not, as manie great Clerkes are like, to a whett<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, that being blunt and dull itſelfe,<note place="margin">Like Eſaias his cole, that pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified his lippes.</note> whet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth other things and sharpeth them; it was not ſo with this man; for though he wrote theſe bookes with a dead blacke coale, yet was there a moſt hote burning coale, ſuch an one, as puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed the lippes of the holie prophett Eſaias, that directed his hand with the black coale, and ſo enflamed &amp; incenſed his hart withall to heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that the good and holeſome inſtructions and counſell that he gaue to other men in his bookes, he himſelfe afterward in moſt patient ſuffering the loſſe of his goods and landes, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment &amp; death for the defence of iuſtice and of the Catholike Fayth experimented &amp; worthily practiſed in himſelfe.</p>

augmente and increaſe the eſtimation, which the world already hath in forraine Countries, of his incomparable witt, learning, and vertue.</p>
