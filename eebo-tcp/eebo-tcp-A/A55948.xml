         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT is thought fit, and ordered by this Court, That a brief account of the Inducement to the proceedings, and of the proceedings againſt the Pariſh-Officers hereafter named, at the Seſſions of <hi>Oier &amp; Terminer,</hi> be publiſhed and Printed, as followeth.</p>
            <p>That the Tower-Hamlets conſiſt of Nineteen Pariſhes and Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets; which Hamlets are as numerous as moſt Pariſhes in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the people for the moſt part conſiſt of Weavers, and other Manufacturers, and of Sea-men, Water-men, and ſuch who relate to Shipping and Sea-ſervice; and are generally very Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious and Poor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:58248:2"/>That there were about Sixteen great and publick Conventicles within the ſaid Hamlets, and Houſes built for them as big as moſt Churches; and fitted up with Pews and Pulpits, as Churches.</p>
            <p>That the Juſtices of Peace of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> living in the ſaid Tower-hamlets, could never prevail with the Conſtables and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh-Officers to ſuppreſs the ſaid Conventicles; nor during the time of the <hi>Ignoramus Juries,</hi> could invent any way to ſuppreſs them; in regard, that if any Fine had been laid upon any of the Hearers or Preachers, above Ten ſhillings, there lay an Appeal, which was to have been tryed by a Jury, which would certainly have gone againſt the conviction of the Juſtices; and thereby the Juſtices would have been Derided, the Government Baffled, and thoſe Factious perſons who frequented thoſe Conventicles, made more Inſolent and Rebellious.</p>
            <p>That as ſoon as there were Loyal Sheriffs of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently hopes of good Juries, the Juſtices went in perſon, and did in a little time ſuppreſs thoſe publick and bold Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles.</p>
            <p>That the ſaid Juſtices were forced, to their great trouble and charges, to keep frequent Seſſions in the Tower-Hamlets for the preſervation of the peace; without which, in all probability, the Factious people there in thoſe times, had got into Rebellion, being ripe for it.</p>
            <p>That notwithſtanding this Care of the Juſtices, and altho, the publick Conventicles were ſuppreſſed, yet the Factious people got together in great numbers in private Houſes, and held Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles there, and thoſe in great numbers; of which none of the Pariſh-Officers would make any diſcovery, nor execute any of the Juſtices Warrants to that purpoſe; which did enforce the Juſtices to employ ſtrangers in that Service, and by them the Juſtices have had intelligence where thoſe Conventicles have been kept, and have been forced to repair to the places them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſuppreſs them, not daring to truſt any Pariſh-Officers; which was ſo great a trouble and toil to the Juſtices, that they did reſolve to keep a Seſſions in every Pariſh and Hamlet, to the intent they might make a full enquiry into all places, and a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect diſcovery of thoſe Factious and Rebellious perſons, who contemned all Authority; and this they were more inclined to do, becauſe they did apprehend, that ſome of thoſe Traitors and Miſcreants, who were in the late Horrid Plot for the Murther of His Majeſty, and His Royal Brother, might lurk in ſome of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58248:2"/>
thoſe places; And therefore ſent out their Warrants to the High-Conſtable, requiring him to iſſue forth his Warrant to the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of the ſeveral Pariſhes and Hamlets, to give notice of a Seſſions, and to require them to bring in a Liſt to that Seſſions of the Inhabitants, Houſe-keepers, and Inmates, to the intent a diſcovery might be made what they were, and who they were who did diſturb the Government, and would not conform to the Laws; And to their great charge and trouble, the Juſtices went through moſt of the Pariſhes and Hamlets, and kept Seſſions, at laſt they came to the Hamlet of <hi>Spittle-fields,</hi> and there on the thirtieth day of <hi>July,</hi> Sir <hi>William Smith</hi> Baronet, Sir <hi>John Berry</hi> Knight, <hi>Charles Osborne</hi>

               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Juſtices of the Peace, Living in the Tower-ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, held a Seſſions, to which the Pariſh-Officers were ſummoned, to give an account upon Oath of the Inhabitants, Houſe-keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Inmates, within that Hamlet, which is the moſt Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hamlet of all the Tower-Diviſion, having had many Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticles in it, which it ſtill hath; and which the Juſtices could never prevail with the Pariſh-Officers to ſuppreſs or Diſcover; and being then required to take an Oath to that end, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Fifteen in number, unanimouſly refuſed (to the great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Authority, and the diſappointing the Juſtices of that diſcovery they hoped to have made there; for which contempt the Juſtices demanded of them to find Sureties to appear at the General Seſſions, to anſwer the Contempt; and in the mean time to be of the Good Behaviour; which they likewiſe unanimouſly refuſed to do; for which the Juſtices committed them to his Majeſties Gaol of New-Priſon; and as they went out of the Court, in great ſcorn they bid the Juſtices look to the Poor; and the very next day, the poor in great numbers, in a Mutinous and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious way, came to the Houſes of Sir <hi>William Smith,</hi> Sir <hi>John Berry,</hi> and <hi>Arnold Brown,</hi> to demand money of them, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to the Miniſter of the Pariſh of <hi>Stepney,</hi> and threatned they would come a great multitude of them on Sunday to the Church, to demand Relief there; and did declare they were incouraged to this mutinous proceeding, by the inſtigation of ſome of thoſe Officers in priſon. Which practice might have had an ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, if by the Juſtices Care it had not been prevented. That the ſaid Officers continued in Priſon about three weeks, and did not apply to any of the Juſtices of the Peace to be Bailed; but ſtayed until one of His Majeſties Judges of the Kings Bench came
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58248:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
from the Circuit, and then put in Bayl before him to appear at this General Seſſions, where by a Commiſſion of <hi>Oier</hi> and <hi>Termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> they were tryed, and upon a full hearing of the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and of the Parties and their Council, they were found Guilty, and Judgment given againſt them, as followeth, <hi>viz. Edward Binns</hi> fined an Hundred pounds, <hi>John Cartwright</hi> an hundred pounds, <hi>David Waine</hi> an hundred pounds, <hi>Roland Trion, Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher Tooley, William Cowley, John Hilton, Richard Skingley, Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence Culliford, Samuel Winnet,</hi> Fifty pounds a piece; <hi>William Sumner, John Newit,</hi> and <hi>John Miller,</hi> who confeſſed the ſaid Indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Five marks a piece; <hi>George Henwood</hi> thirteen ſhillings and four pence; and all committed to New-Priſon, until they have paid their ſaid Fines; and <hi>John Child,</hi> the Head Beadle of the ſaid <hi>Spittle-fields,</hi> to be ſet Twice in the Pillory.</p>
            <p>That for the ſame Offence, Five other Officers of the Hamlet of <hi>Bethnal-Green,</hi> had Judgment given againſt them as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>viz. James Pittman,</hi> who would not Plead or Anſwer to the Indictment, hath Judgment given againſt him by <hi>Nihil dicit,</hi> is fined Two hundred pounds; <hi>William Malin, Richard Stratford,</hi> and <hi>William Palmer,</hi> who confeſſed the Indictment, are fined five marks a piece, and all committed to New-Priſon, until they have paid their reſpective Fines; <hi>Samuel Wheeler,</hi> Beadle of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal-Green,</hi> to be ſet Once in the Pillory.</p>
