            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>My Lord,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Am ſo far from wondring at the extraordinary Concern which you are pleaſed to expreſs for the late bad News of our Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's having come away from ſo Valuable and Impregnable a Settlement, as that of which they were Poſſeſs'd, in the very Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel of the Trading World (if I may properly ſo call it) that I ſhould much more Wonder, if any Man who carries <hi>Scots</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Blood in his Veins, and pretends to have any regard either for the Honour, Intereſt, or Reputation of his Countrey, ſhould not, upon ſo provoking an Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, contribute as much as in him lies, to retrieve ſo great a Loſs at any Rate, and have a juſt Reſentment againſt the Authors of ſo Surpriſing and Unaccountable an Emergency.</p>
            <p>You tell me (which is true) that ſeveral People, according to their different Intereſts and Affections, as well as different Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to Penetrate into, and judge of, the true Grounds of ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected an Emergency, do vent their Opinions and Reflections variouſly concerning it: Some attributing it to the want of due Care in the Directors at home, to ſend Intelligence, as well as the needful Supplies of Men and Proviſions to the Colony, in due time; ſome to the Temerity, Imprudence and Incapacity, of thoſe who were intruſted abroad, with the Management and Government of the Colony; ſome (who you ſay are the far greater Number) to the effect of His Majeſty's Proclamations iſſued forth in all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations of <hi>America,</hi> declaring the ſaid Settlement ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, and ſtrictly intercomuning all Perſons thereunto belonging; And you are pleaſed to deſire my Sentiments of the whole Matter.</p>
            <p>It may poſſibly be reckon'd no ſmall piece of Preſumption in one of my weak Talent, to venture upon ſetting Pen to Paper, upon ſo Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal an Occaſion as this is; and how willing ſoever I might have been at any other time to gratify your Requeſt that way, I muſt Confeſs, I am in ſo Splenetick a Mood, at this Juncture, that my Inclinations prompt me but very little to beſtow my Time upon Scribbling:
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63768:3"/>
Yet your Commands being always Indiſputeable with me, I ſhall ſupercede my own Inclinations at this time, and freely give you my Thoughts of the Matter, with all imaginable Candour, as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctly as I can, and commit the whole to your own Diſcretion, being well aſſur'd that you'l Adviſe nothing thereupon, but what you are fully convinc'd will be moſt Suteable to the Honour, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, and Reputation of the Nation, which (by the by) was, in my humble Opinion, never at a lower Ebb than at preſent.</p>
            <p>That the Directors of our <hi>Indian</hi> and <hi>African</hi> Company at home, are no manner of way Chargeable with any Omiſſion or want of due Care in making early Proviſions for Supplies to the Colony, or with any Miſ-managements in taking wrong Meaſures, upon ſome Occaſion or other, or with too much Eaſineſs and Credulity (as ſome do alledge) in ſuffering themſelves to be Over-perſwaded, or any otherways impoſed upon by mercenary Pretenders, who at the ſame time might poſſibly have been the Tools for driving on a For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Intereſt, for ſelfiſh Ends, is more than I ſhall take upon me to maintain too poſitively in their behalf: But ſure I am, the many Diſ-appointments, Difficulties and wicked Contrivances, which they were all along oblig'd to grapple with, both Abroad and at Home, made their Part very uneaſie, and were enough to daunt the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of any privat Society whatſoever; eſpecially finding them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſo openly diſcountenanc'd by Authority, that the Adventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers were thereby diſcourag'd from paying in their Shares; yea in ſo much that the Directors were not only ſheckled from purſuing many reaſonable and convenient Meaſures that they had in View, but were alſo often oblig'd to pawn their own privat Credit for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, and doing thoſe things that were indiſpenſibly neceſſary for ſupporting the common Intereſt, and wait for their Relief till a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Opportunity ſhould offer.</p>
            <p>But whatever Eſcapes they may be chargeable with, I dare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently averr in their behalf, that they have Directed to the beſt of their Knowledge; and I doubt very much, whether the moſt part of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:63768:3"/>
all thoſe, who ever yet took the Liberty of Cenſuring their Actions, would have taken half ſo Rational Meaſures, had they had the ſame Game to play, and the ſame Difficulties to encounter with: For, as the Directors were Choſen by the Solemn Election and Suffrage of all the Adventurers in the Joint-Stock of the Company, (wherein the moſt conſiderable of the Nobility, Gentry, and whole Body of the Royal Burrows are concerned) ſo it muſt be allowed, that the Generality of thoſe in the Direction, are Perſons of as much known Honour, Probity and Integrity, and of as much Knowledge too, as can be found of any other Set of Men in the Nation: But the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued Thwartings that they met with from time to time, did not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſarly retard many of their Meaſures, but made alſo ſome of thoſe Meaſures prove altogether Abortive, tho', never ſo rationally projected: And it's very obſervable, that none have been more bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie and meddling in Cenſuring their Conduct all along, and even at this time, than ſome who had little or no Concern in the Stock, and others who were ready upon all Occaſions to throw Stumbling Blocks in their Way. But 'tis very eaſy, and no new Thing, to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Credulous Fools, or Deſigning Knaves, (who, alas! are by far, the greateſt part of Mankind) to Cenſure the beſt of Mens Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, without ever conſidering the Reaſonableneſs of the Meaſures they take, or the Croſsneſs of any Accidents they may meet with. And this brings into my Remembrance a Saying of the Renowned Sir <hi>Walter Raleigh,</hi> in his Apology for his Voyage to <hi>Guiana: As good Succeſs admits no Examination, ſo the contrary allows of no Excuſe, how reaſonable or juſt ſoever.</hi> And indeed the Poet is very juſt upon that Head:
<q>
                  <l>—Careat ſucceſſibus opto</l>
                  <l>Quiſquis ab eventu facta notanda putat. <bibl>Ovid. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3.</bibl>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>It is very evident by the Strain of the Acts of Parliament and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patent, eſtabliſhing the ſaid Company, that theſe who projected that Scheme had in View, ſooner or later, no leſs Deſ<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>gn than a Trade to both the <hi>Indies</hi> and to <hi>Africa,</hi> and that by a more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63768:4"/>
and much quicker Communication than was ever before practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by any Society whatſoever.</p>
            <p>In order whereunto, thoſe in the Management thought it was not only neceſſary, to eſtabliſh a Free and Staple-Port in ſome convenient Place or Places on that <hi>Iſthmus</hi> or Nick of Land, ſituated on the Height of the World, between the North and South Seas, formerly called <hi>Darien,</hi> or in ſome ſuch convenient Place, but alſo to raiſe a Joynt-Stock ſuteable to the Greatneſs of ſuch an Undertaking.</p>
            <p>And not imagining that privat Hands in this Kingdom could of themſelves be able to raiſe a ſufficient Stock for that Purpoſe, the firſt Offer thereof was made to our Friends at <hi>London,</hi> who in nine days time concluded a Subſcription there, of 300000 Pounds <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> and paid in the firſt fourth Part thereof either in Money, Bank-Bills, or Notes payable on Demand, and further declared their Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to Subſcribe for as much more, if allowed: But you know how that Subſcription was quickly render'd void by the Meaſures taken in the Parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Attempt (you know) that the Directors made for ſtrengthning their Stock and Intereſt, was to endeavour the procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Forreign Subſcriptions for ſome conſiderable Sum; And in Order thereunto, upon repeated encouraging Advices from ſeveral Parts beyond Sea, but more eſpecially from <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> they ſent ſome of their own Number, as Commiſſioners or Deputees thither, with whom ſoon after their Arrival, the Merchants of the ſaid City of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> enter'd into Contract to joyn at leaſt 200000 Pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> with the Company's Stock: But you know likewiſe, how the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Miniſters there, did, under Pretence of a ſpecial War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant from His Majeſty, put a Stop thereunto, by giving in a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to the Senat of that City, <hi>Not only, diſowning the Authority of the ſaid Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent, but alſo threatning both Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nat and Inhabitants with the Kings outmoſt Diſpleaſure, if they ſhould countenance or joyn with the Company's ſaid Deputees, in any Treaty of Trade or Commerce.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:63768:4"/>
Notwithſtanding whereof, tho' the <hi>Council-General</hi> and <hi>Court of Directors</hi> of the ſaid Company have, not only often Addreſs'd and Petition'd the King and Privy Council of this Kingdom, but alſo His Majeſty's High Commiſſioner, and the Right Honourable Eſtates of Parliament at their laſt Seſſion; And likewiſe, that the ſaid Eſtates were thereupon pleaſed, by their Unanimous Addreſs of the 5th. of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1698 to His Majeſty, <hi>To manifeſt not only their own, and the whole Nation's Concern in that Matter, earneſtly entreating, and moſt aſſuredly expecting, that His Majeſty would, in His Royal Wiſdom, take ſuch Meaſures as might effectually vindicat the Undoubted Rights and Privileges of the ſaid Company, and ſupport the Credit and Intereſt thereof;</hi> But were alſo pleaſed in the ſame Addreſs, <hi>To recommend the Concerns of the ſaid Company to ſome ſpecial Marks of His Majeſty's Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Favour, as being that Branch of the Trade of this Kingdom, in which They and the Nation they repreſent, have a more peculiar Intereſt.</hi> Yet (it ſeems) His Majeſty has been all along ſo taken up with the far greater and more general Concerns of <hi>Europe,</hi> that, to this Hour, I have not heard of any manner of Redreſs that has been given in that Matter.</p>
            <p>There were likewiſe conſiderable Steps and Advances made by ſeveral Merchants in <hi>Holland,</hi> particularly at <hi>Amſterdam</hi> and <hi>Rotterdam,</hi> towards a Subſcription there; But upon notice had of their Meetings with the Company's Deputees above-mention'd, and of the Succeſs their Negotiations were like to have had, the moſt conſiderable and Leading Men of thoſe Merchants, who had ſhewed moſt Forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in that Matter, were ſent for by ſome of the States, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>that Meaſures would be taken, to make them repent their Doings, if they perſiſted any further in Treating with the ſaid Deputees, or if they would joyn with the</hi> Scots <hi>Company.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, I remember, happen'd ſome Months before the <hi>Hamburgh-Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial</hi> above-mention'd was preſented, which I confeſs makes it ſeem a Problem to me, as well as to many others that have heard of it, <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the</hi> Engliſh <hi>were influenc'd by the</hi> Dutch, <hi>or the</hi> Dutch <hi>by the</hi> En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,

            <p>But to paſs over all theſe previous Diſcouragements and Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and to come cloſely to the Point in Hand, The Colony that was firſt ſent away in <hi>July</hi> 1698, for ſettling a Plantation in <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> purſuant to the Inſtructions then given, carried along with them not only abundance of all Neceſſaries for ſuch an Undertaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but alſo ſuch a Quantity of Proviſions, as was calculated for a whole Year, and of ſome Particulars (namely Stock-Fiſh) what was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted might have ſerved for near 18 Months: And for their further Security, in caſe thoſe Proviſions ſhould happen to fall ſhort, before Advice could be had of their Settlement, and the freſh Supplies of Proviſions ſent after them, there was likewiſe a Cargo of Sortable Goods, to the Value of about 16000 Pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> prime Coſt here, ſent along with them, at the abſolute Diſpoſal of the Council, for the Colony's Uſe; which Goods were either to be Traded with upon the Coaſt and <hi>American</hi> Iſlands, or Barter'd for Proviſions and other Neceſſaries at the Council's Diſcretion, as ſhould beſt ſute with their Circumſtances for the time. Yet ſuch was the Directors Care of their Welfare and Safety, That, immediatly after their Departure from <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Directors did, upon the Encouragement of the Parliaments Addreſs above-recited, apply themſelves in a dutiful manner to His Majeſty, by their humble Petition of the 16th. of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt</hi> 1698, <hi>To beſtow upon them, as a Gracious Mark of His Royal Favour, the Uſe of the two ſmall Friggots. then</hi> (and to this Hour) <hi>lying uſeleſs in</hi> Burnti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:63768:5"/>
before them a Repreſentation in Writing (which contained an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract of the then State of the Company's Affairs, together alſo with their own Opinion, what they thought neceſſary to be done by the Company at that Juncture, with relation to a Supply of Proviſions and other Neceſſaries to be ſent to the Company's Colony) they thereupon ordered a further Proportion of the Company's Joint-Stock to be call'd in, from the reſpective Proprietors for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And upon the 9<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>November,</hi> The <hi>Court of Directors</hi> did, upon the Proſpect of the <hi>Martinmaſs</hi> Payments, come to a Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that a Ship of near about 200 Tuns burden, ſhould be bought forthwith for the Company's Uſe, and that the buying and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereof, as alſo the buying of the needful Proviſions for a Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the Colony, ſhould be referred to a Committee which was appointed for that End; but after enquiry made in ſeveral Places a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſuch a Veſſel, they could find none reported to be ſo fit for their Purpoſe, as one that lay then in <hi>Leith-Harbour,</hi> expoſed to Sale; which one of their Number bought, with a ſpecial Condition to be free, if upon Survey ſhe ſhould not be ſound fit for the Company's Uſe: And upon the 14<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>December</hi> (which was near about four Months before any Word came from the Colony) the Court of Directors gave Orders to conclude the Bargain for the ſaid Ship, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to former Agreement, and to fit her out with Proviſions for the Colony, with all poſſible Expedition: But the Ship when bought (tho' a known prime Sailer, and after all the neceſſary Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution had in buying of her) happening not to be ſo Sound as was expected, took a much longer time to be Repaired, than could well have been imagined, and could not therefore Sail as ſoon as was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.</p>
            <p>But in the mean time, the Directors being loath (it ſeems) to Truſt to the ſaid Ship only, in caſe of Accidents, made it their Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to find out, and purchaſe a good Sailing Ship, <hi>Engliſh</hi>-qualified, to be diſpatched from <hi>Clyde</hi> with Proviſions, and the needful Advices for the ſaid Colony: And upon finding a Ship ſo qualified, ſhe was
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63768:6"/>
diſpatched from <hi>Clyde</hi> upon the 24 of <hi>February</hi> laſt; but to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's and Colony's ineſtimable Loſs, the ſaid Veſſel was caſt away on one of the Weſt Iſlands of <hi>Scotland:</hi> Of which Accident the <hi>Court of Directors</hi> had no Advice before the 11th. Day of <hi>April:</hi> And the Loſs was ſtill the greater in this, that ſhe was bought ſo qualified, with a View to be ſerviceable to the Colony, not only in Trading upon the Coaſt, but alſo in running backward and forward, to and from any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, with Goods, Proviſions, and Intelligence; ſhe being qualified to touch there in the ſtricteſt ſenſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Act of Navigation.</p>
            <p>You may remember likewiſe, that the other Ship abovemention'd was juſt ready to Sail about the latter-end of <hi>March</hi> laſt, being the time that the firſt Advices arrived here of the <hi>Colony</hi>'s Settlement and good Condition: But the Directors having Intelligence of Three <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships of Force, that were to Sail about that time from <hi>Cadiz</hi> to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> with a Re-inforcement of Men, Arms and Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, for <hi>Carthagena,</hi> under the Command of <hi>Don Piementel,</hi> the preſent Governour of that City, and that he had particular In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, with relation to our Settlement; they thought it not ſafe to let the Company's ſaid Ship ſail alone; and therefore ſtopt her, till another Ship of Force might be got ready with Men and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; which accordingly being got, both the ſaid Ships ſet ſail from <hi>Leith-Road,</hi> on the 12th. of <hi>May</hi> laſt, with a Recruit of 300 Men, about 900 Bolls of Wheat made into Bisket and Flower, as alſo a conſiderable Quantity of Peaſe, Pork, Oyl, Brandy, ſome Beef, Arms, Ammunition, and other Neceſſaries; carrying likewiſe along with them Advices, that a much more conſiderable Recruit of Ships, Men, Proviſions, Arms, Ammunition and other Neceſſaries, were to follow with all convenient Diſpatch, under Convoy of the <hi>Riſing-Sun.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the Directors did accordingly diſpatch the <hi>Riſing-Sun,</hi> and three other Ships of conſiderable Force and Burthen, from <hi>Greenock,</hi> the 18<hi>th.</hi> Day of <hi>Auguſt</hi> laſt; tho' by contrary Winds they were ſtopt,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:63768:6"/>
ſo as that they could not ſail further than the Iſle of <hi>Bute,</hi> till the 24<hi>th</hi> of <hi>September</hi> following: They had 1300 Men on board, with as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Ingineers, Fire-Workers, Bombardeers, Battering Guns, Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, Bombs, and other Warlike Proviſions, as (if ſafely arrived at the Colony in due time, and conſidering the Situation and natural Strength of the Place) might reaſonably be preſumed to have made it impregnable.</p>
            <p>Nor was this all, for immediatly after the firſt Advice that the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors had of the Colony's Settlement, they wrote back to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, by the ſeveral Ways of <hi>New-England, Jamaica, Barbados, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegoa,</hi> and the other <hi>Leeward Iſlands,</hi> that theſe Recruits above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned were coming to them; and in the mean time, ſent them an Illimited and Diſcretionary Credit, for buying of Proviſions from any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, if they ſhould happen to ſtand in need thereof; Which Credit the Directors were induced to give, from an Aſſurance that they had given them, by ſeveral Perſons at <hi>London,</hi> and in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> of their good Inclinations to Supply the Colony with Proviſions, if ſuch a Credit were given; and for that end, Printed Copies of the ſaid Credit were ſent by the Way of <hi>London,</hi> to be diſperſed over all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations in <hi>America.</hi> And upon the Faith thereof, ſeveral Sloops and Brigantins, freighted full of Proviſions, were diſpatched from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations to our Colony; particularly from <hi>New-England, New-York, Road-Iſland,</hi> and <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> tho', alas! they happen'd to be too late, thoſe of the Colony being unluckily come away from <hi>Darien,</hi> ſome Weeks, before theſe Sloops could well be arrived there: So that this was no ſuch Imaginary Credit, as ſome People would have us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it to have been. Yea further, even before the ſaid Credit was known in <hi>America,</hi> not only ſeveral Sloops went with Proviſions from <hi>Jamaica</hi> to the Colony, and Barter'd their Proviſions for other Goods: But alſo, a <hi>New-England</hi> Brigantin, freighted full of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſold her Cargo to the Council of the Colony, for Bills drawn by them upon the Company's Caſhier here; Which Bills amounted
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:63768:7"/>
to about 700 Pounds <hi>Sterling,</hi> and were punctually paid according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. By which it may evidently appear, that if no extraordinary Methods had been uſed to put a Barr to their begun Correſpondence, there had been little or no Occaſion for any ſpecial Credit on parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Perſons.</p>
            <p>And upon the Directors having received the ſaid ſurprizing and unexpected News of their Colony's coming away from <hi>Darien,</hi> they immediatly came to Reſolutions of diſpatching a particular Credit, with proper Advices, <hi>per</hi> Expreſs to <hi>New-York,</hi> by a Veſſel then bound thither, where they underſtood moſt of their Men were, and to ſend other Expreſſes, by ſeveral Ways, in queſt of both the firſt and laſt Recruits ſent to the Colony; with Orders to repoſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their former Settlement, and to fend Supplies of Proviſions and other Neceſſaries after them, as ſoon as poſſible; and to have from hence forward ſome ſmall Veſſels or Advice-Boats, running conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, backward and forward, with certain Intelligence, between this and the Colony, their former way of Correſponding having (it ſeems) fail'd by reaſon of the Proclamations above-mention'd; as ſhall appear, more particularly, by and by.</p>
            <p>And becauſe the Expediting of thoſe ſeveral Expreſſes, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a Credit for Proviſions, and other Neceſſaries, could not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any Delay, at ſo Critical a Juncture, they frankly engag'd their own privat Credits, for thoſe ſeveral Purpoſes, until the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's own Money ſhould come in to Anſwer the ſame; and in the mean time, they called a Meeting of the Council-General, who approved of thoſe Reſolutions: And ſeveral of the Councellours did likewiſe freely and generouſly joyn their own privat Credits with that of the Directors, for the Purpoſes aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>In Purſuance of which Reſolutions, the Directors ſent a Credit of 2000 Pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> to <hi>New-York</hi> by a Gentleman, whom they ſent Expreſs from hence thither, in the beginning of <hi>October</hi> laſt, with proper Inſtructions ſuteable to the Occaſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:63768:7"/>
They ſent likewiſe at the ſame time, by a Ship then bound from the <hi>Downs</hi> to the <hi>Leeward Iſlands,</hi> and <hi>Jamaica,</hi> a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ew Councellour for the Colony, fully inſtructed in relation to this Emergency, with Orders to go with all poſſible Diſpatch, in queſt of the Recruits lately ſent to the Colony: And the better to enable him to execute effectually what was then given him in Commiſſion, he carried a Credit of 1000 Pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> along with him. Since which, they have, in the Month of <hi>November</hi> laſt, diſpatch'd one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany's own Ships, full of Proviſions and other Neceſſaries for the Colony, from <hi>Clyde;</hi> and ſent another Councellour on board there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, with a Credit of 500 Pounds <hi>Sterling</hi> more: And about the ſame time, they freighted another Ship, which ſail'd from <hi>Forth</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ago, to carry Proviſions to the Colony: And (as I'm inform'd) are now upon diſpatching forthwith two other Ships with more Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions after them; the one from <hi>Forth</hi> and the other from <hi>Clyde;</hi> That from <hi>Forth</hi> being already agreed for, and bound by Charter-Party to ſail (God willing) on the 20<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>January</hi> next.</p>
            <p>Now this, being a ſhort Abridgment of what I underſtand, may be offered in Juſtification of the Directors Care and Conduct: I ſhall now proceed to give you a ſhort View of what occurs to me at preſent, with relation to the Conduct of thoſe, who were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted Abroad with the Management and Government of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, under the Name of Councellours.</p>
            <p>That the Equippage ſent by the Company on their firſt Expediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for ſettling a Colony in <hi>America,</hi> was, in all Reſpects, ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or to any that was ever before ſent on the like Account, by any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vat Society in <hi>Europe,</hi> is what I never heard in the leaſt contraver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: And as the Generality of the Men who went on that Expedition, gave former Proofs to the World, in their reſpective Stations, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the laſt War, of their Fitneſs for ſuch an Undertaking; ſo it has been agreed upon, by all that ever ſaw them, not only when they went away, but alſo after their Arrival and Settlement in <hi>America,</hi> that they were, ſeemingly, as hopeful and promiſing a Set of Men, as
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:63768:8"/>
ever were ſeen (to the Memory of Man) in thoſe Parts; had they been under the Government and Care of ſuch Heads as were to be wiſh'd: But many People do ſay, that the Council appointed for the Government of the Colony, was compoſed of an odd kind of Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Perſons, of Heterogeneous Humours and Principles, and that few of them were fit for that Station.</p>
            <p>The Truth is, whatever may be in this, I'm certain that the Directors were at no ſmall Pains to invite ſuch as they thought moſt capable for that Station; but it not being publickly known, where they were deſign'd to ſettle, there were but very few Candidates; and there's nothing I know better, than that thoſe of them who were moſt ſtrongly recommended as Perſons of Capacity, Honour and Honeſty, prov'd to be the leaſt deſerving of that Character, of all that went under the Denomination of Councellours.</p>
            <p>I was told, indeed, that there was too much Emulation, Jealouſy, private Animoſities, and Pique among themſelves; and that the bad Example thereof gave too much ground to believe, that the like Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities were diffuſed among the inferior Officers and others, as they ſtood ſeverally affected or engaged, more or leſs, to this or that Councellour: Yet, by the Influence of ſome few of the diſcreeteſt of their number, for above Eight Months time together, they had ſo much Prudence, as to ſtiffle thoſe Diviſions (as much as poſſible) in all publick Concerns, for carrying on the common Intereſt; as may evidently appear by the Unanimity and Diſcretion of all their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and Letters to the Directors at Home, as well as by their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Tranſactions with ſuch as had to do with them in <hi>America;</hi> par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in all their Tranſactions with the <hi>Indians,</hi> the Preſident of <hi>Panama,</hi> the Governours of <hi>Carthagena</hi> and <hi>Sancta Maria,</hi> and the Commander of a <hi>French</hi> Veſſel, which happen'd to be Shipwrack'd near their Settlement; &amp; their Diligence and Care in building of Houſes, clearing of the Ground, and fortifying of their Settlement, in ſuch manner, that it was look'd upon, by all that ſaw it, or had account of it, to be almoſt Impregnable; till that about the latter-end of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63768:8"/>
               <hi>March</hi> laſt, by reaſon of the Abſence of ſome, and Indiſpoſition of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſo few remain'd, that for ſome Weeks together, their Votes run generally ſplit, being only two of a ſide, and conſequently all Buſineſs almoſt at a ſtand.</p>
            <p>Yet ſuch was the Excellence of the <hi>Conſtitutions</hi> by which they were to Govern, that by means thereof, and by the Providential Recovery of one of their Number out of a deſperate Sickneſs, to caſt the Ballance, they quickly wrought their own Cure: For by the aſſumption of Three or Four New Councellours, and the humorous withdrawing of two of the Old, whoſe Places were thereupon deſervedly declared Vacant; the Council wrought it ſelf ſo into one piece, that their Actings look'd then, like that of one Man: And tho the Seaſon had, all of a ſudden, (as is ſaid) ſowred ſome of their Proviſions (which continued very Good till the Rains came on in <hi>April)</hi> and tho their Men turn'd afterwards very Sickly upon their Hands; yet they were firmly reſolved to maintain that Place and Intereſt to the laſt, as appears by the Letters which they diſpatched Home upon that Occaſion, preſſing that Supplies might be ſent to them with all Expedition.</p>
            <p>And in the mean time, they not only engaged one Captain <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im Pilkington</hi> of <hi>Port-Royal</hi> (who had been, it ſeems, ſometime in their Service, and was reſolved to bring his whole Family to live in <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledonia)</hi> to return with his Shallop full of freſh Proviſions and ſtrong Liquors from <hi>Jamaica;</hi> but ſent alſo a Sloop of their own thither, with Money and Goods to purchaſe Proviſions; yet neither the one, nor the other, could have any, by Reaſon of the Proclamation that was publiſhed there ſometime before: And it is very obſervable, that the ſaid Proclamation, was, for haſte's ſake, publiſhed at <hi>Port-Royal</hi> in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> upon a <hi>Sunday,</hi> being the 9<hi>th</hi> day of <hi>April,</hi> to ſtop two other Sloops that were ready to ſail from thence next Morning, with Proviſions and ſtrong Liquors for <hi>Caledonia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And the unhappy News thereof arriving at <hi>Caledonia,</hi> the 18<hi>th,</hi> day of <hi>May,</hi> together with a Copy of the ſaid Proclamation, as alſo
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63768:9"/>
a wicked contrived Story, <hi>That the Company at home had, upon ſome Occaſion or other, Petition'd or Addreſs'd the Parliament of</hi> Scotland, <hi>and that their Petition was unanimouſly rejected, and thrown with Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain over the Bar;</hi> the Council and Colony were, as it were, Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruck all at once, with thoſe Accounts, eſpecially when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd the Treatment which they knew the Company had met with at <hi>London, Hamburgh,</hi> and other Places, and the malicious Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors that were induſtriouſly ſpred here, before they went away, of what the Parliament might poſſibly be induced to do; ſince it was whiſpered as if the Commiſſioner had had Inſtructions to lay an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bargo on the Company's Ships; and not having received one ſingle Line from <hi>Scotland</hi> ſince their Departure hence, they were eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in the belief thereof, and concluded, That certainly the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany was quite defeat and cruſh'd at home, and had not the liberty of ſending ſo much as any Advice to them to ſhift for themſelves. All which Suggeſtions were ſo ſucceſsfully improved by the Perſon, whom I have heard, moſt blamed upon that Occaſion, that he found, at laſt, the ſaid Proclamations gave him a Handle to ſay or propoſe any thing whatſoever, tho never ſo villainous; and particularly, <hi>That as, by the ſaid Proclamations, they were poſitively declared to have broken the Peace, by ſettling at</hi> Darien; <hi>ſo of conſequence they were declared Pyrates; and that, as they could not think of ſtaying there, abandon'd by all the World, ſo it would be dangerous for them to go to any of the</hi> Britiſh <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, for fear of Hanging:</hi> And therefore propoſed, <hi>that they ſhould ſail directly to</hi> Hamburgh, <hi>or ſome other Foreign Port, and diſpoſe of the Ships and Effects; or at leaſt to take up Money upon them, to pay the Seamen their Wages.</hi> Which Pretence, he thought, might ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently baite many (at leaſt the Seamen) to cloſe with his Propoſal: But the Propoſal was ſo ſelf-evidently Wicked, Unnatural, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the Truſt repoſed in them by the Company, that it was exploded with Reproach, by all thoſe who had any Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour or Honeſty in them, and ſo fell to the Ground; Tho' the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> away was what few or none (it ſeems) ſaid any thing mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:63768:9"/>
againſt, after having got thoſe Accounts: Nor indeed can I ſee what could well be retorted to Captain <hi>P—k,</hi> when he urged that all the Arguments made uſe of for ſtaying, were grounded at beſt but upon Suppoſitions; whereas their Reaſons for coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, were grounded upon real Things, <hi>viz.</hi> the Proclamations, want of Intelligence, and ſcarcity of Proviſions. And indeed it muſt be allowed, that if no ſuch Proclamation had been publiſhed, he durſt never have had the Impudence to have made ſuch a wicked Propoſal, at leaſt ſo openly, as is above narrated.</p>
            <p>Now to recapitulate the whole Matter, you ſee the ſum of what thoſe in the Colony do offer in juſtification of their coming away, is their being in ſuch deſperate Circumſtances, that in a crowd of confuſed and perplexed Thoughts, they believed the longer they would ſtay there, the worſe it would be for them: Becauſe ſeveral Species's of thoſe few Proviſions which they had left, were rotting (as they ſay) upon their hands; moſt of their Men fell ſick and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with but ſlender Hopes of their Recovery, for want of freſh Proviſions, ſtrong Liquors, and good Looking after; and were out of all manner of Hopes of getting any Supplies, by reaſon of the Proclamations, and the Story above-narrated, eſpecially having had no Word from <hi>Scotland</hi> all the time; which fully determin'd them in that Fatal Reſolution of coming away, (Bag and Baggage) Steering their Courſe to <hi>New-York,</hi> in Hopes to get ſome Proviſions there, in Barter for Goods, which might carry them to <hi>Scotland:</hi> But how Inhumanely they were Treated by the Government there (tho' the Generality of the People were inclined to be kind to them) in their diſtreſs'd Condition, is too well known; as is alſo the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Treatment, which thoſe on board the <hi>Saint-Andrew</hi> met with, from the Government of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> upon her being (it ſeems) for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in there by Streſs of Weather, and to ſhun the <hi>Barlavento-Fleet,</hi> which gave her Chace for ſome days.</p>
            <p>By all which, (if true, as is, indeed, generally ſaid and believed) it ſeems to me naturally concluſive, that, tho' I'm far from ſetting
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63768:10"/>
up to juſtify any Eſcapes or Omiſſions, that the Directors at Home may be truly chargeable with, or to leſſen any Imprudence, Raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Diviſions, that I have heard the Council of the Colony blamed for; yet the Burden of the Song ſtill reſts on the Effects of thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations; becauſe that, if thoſe Proclamations had not been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, I am morally aſſured, that even the groſſeſt Miſtakes in the Management, either at Home or in the Colony, would have been ſoon mended of Courſe, from the Experience that muſt have been had of the Conſequences of their own Omiſſions and Miſtakes.</p>
            <p>And whoever would be at the pains, but to examine the firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Management of the moſt Flouriſhing Trading-Companies this day in <hi>Europe,</hi> might eaſily find, that they have, not only in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy, but even after a much longer ſtanding, been guilty of, at leaſt, as groſs Miſtakes and Omiſſions, as any that I ever, as yet, heard the Directors of our Company juſtly charged with, and that there is no ſuch thing to be precedented, or, indeed, reaſonably expected, as In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility in any Humane Conduct; eſpecially in a Matter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the good, as well as the bad, Succeſs muſt neceſſarly depend on a great many unforeſeen Accidents.</p>
            <p>And yet the Truth is, after all, The moſt Plauſible and Material Objections, which I have heard ſuggeſted againſt the Foreſight and Care of the Directors at Home, are, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> That they imployed Perſons in Fitting out the Ships, Goods, Proviſions, and other Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries for their firſt Expedition, as made no Conſcience of the Truſt repoſed in them; for that the Numbers, Quantities and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of thoſe Goods and Proviſions, were far ſhort of what they were given out for, and ſome of them rotten, even before they went from hence. And, 2<hi>ly,</hi> That they ſhould Truſt to the Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of a Correſpondence, by the Way of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, and not be at the Charges of ſending Letters and Advices frequently by ſome Packet-Boats of their own, directly from hence to the Colony; which would undoubtedly have prevented their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming away in ſuch Deſpair of being relieved from hence, as they ſay they did.</p>
            <p>

This ſeems indeed, at firſt View, to be a heavy Charge, tho' it may be juſtly Anſwered for the <hi>Court of Directors, Firſt,</hi> That thoſe imployed by them, for the Purpoſes aforeſaid, were not only of their own Number, and choſen by the general Suffrage of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venturers in the Joint-Stock; but were alſo reputed Merchants of conſiderable Subſtance and Dealing, and might therefore be reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably preſum'd, not only to have underſtood that Matter of buying and providing Goods, Proviſions and other Neceſſaries for a Sea-Voyage, better than thoſe Noblemen and other Gentlemen in the Direction, who never had Occaſion formerly to be concern'd in a Matter of that Nature; but alſo, that they themſelves being conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably intereſted in the Joint-Stock, and intruſted with the particular Stock, of many of their own Friends, Relations and Acquaintances, and indeed with that which they muſt needs have known, was of Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Concern to the whole Nation; That they would act at leaſt as tenderly and conſcientiouſly therein, as any other Perſons whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, who were not ſo immediatly concerned.</p>
            <p>And for theſe few Directors, who were imployed for buying thoſe Goods and Proviſions, I dare confidently affirm, in favour of ſome of them, that they not only underſtood, and were pretty much accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed with Diſpatches of that kind, (tho' differing perhaps in the Degree) but that they acted alſo with as much Care, Diligence, Integrity, and real Zeal for the Company's Intereſt, as any in the Kingdom could have done; ſo that I reckon, whenever that Matter is fully inquired into, and all Circumſtances conſidered, it will be found, that there was no ſuch great Abuſe, in either the Quantities or Qualities of thoſe Goods and Proviſions, as ſome would have us believe there was: Tho' at the ſame time, (I muſt confeſs) I have, from the beginning, heard one or two of thoſe Directors extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blamed, for making ſome Bargains for the Company, with an alledged viſible Advantage to themſelves: And tho' it muſt be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it were much better for the Company's Intereſt, they had never acted with any ſuch Selfiſh View; yet, granting they did ſo, (which I do not believe) it is very poſſible, they might have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:63768:11"/>
Matters ſo, as to have ſome Advantage by thoſe Bargains to themſelves, and yet the Company be no great Loſers thereby.</p>

                  <p>WHereas I underſtand, that ſome People take the Liberty to ſay and give out, that our Proviſions, which we carried along with us from <hi>Scotland,</hi> were, for the moſt part, rotten and damnified, before we ſcarce got to our Voyage's end, and that ſome of them were quite ſpoiled, even before we went from hence: I think my ſelf, in Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Honour, bound to declare, That on board your Ship the <hi>Caledo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> which I have the Honour to Command, all the Flower and Oat-Meal kept good till the Month of <hi>April,</hi> yea ſome part thereof until the latter-end of <hi>June,</hi> as did alſo the Gray Peaſe, till we had little or nothing of them left, in the latter-end of <hi>April:</hi> And as for the Bread, Beef and Pork, they continued ſound and good, till the very laſt Pound Weight of them. It is true, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Beef (tho' very ſound) was nothing near ſo good as the <hi>Scots</hi> Beef; for which Cauſe we expended it firſt. And as a Proof of the <hi>Scots</hi> Beef's being extraordinary, when I came from on board on <hi>Friday</hi> the <hi>15th.</hi> inſtant, I left four Barrels of it on board as ſound as ever it was, and Dined on a piece of it very comfortably that ſame day, as did alſo the whole Ships Crew, and I doubt much, whether it may not be all eaten up by the Seamen before now, tho' they have other Proviſions on board.</p>
                  <p>I have ſailed for the ſpace of eight Years together in <hi>America,</hi> and I muſt needs ſay, I never in all that time had Proviſions which held out ſo well, which I have often ſignified to ſeveral Perſons in our paſſage.</p>

            <p>Nor is this all; for the ſaid Captain <hi>Robert Drummond</hi> declared further to my own hearing at one time (ſeveral other Gentlemen being then preſent) and at an other time (as I am poſitively infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) before Mr. <hi>Mackenzie</hi> the Company's Secretary, and Mr. <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milton</hi> Clerk of the <hi>Canongate,</hi> at the Ship Tavern<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> That he the ſaid Captain <hi>Robert Drummond</hi> cauſed Over-haul all the Goods and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go that were on board the ſaid Ship under his Command, when they lay in <hi>Caledonia</hi>-Harbour, and that, upon his Conſcience, there was not one Cask, Pack, Bundle, or Bale, in the whole, when he compared the Contents with the Invoyce, but what contained full as much as was charged in the ſaid Invoyce; excepting only one Bundle of Twine, which he ſaid did not contain much above half of what it was charged for; and ſome Hundreds of Sail-Needles too, which he ſaid was wanting out of a Bundle that was charged in the ſaid Invoyce.</p>
            <p>He declared likewiſe at the ſame time, That all the time he was in <hi>Caledonia</hi> he never ſaw one Piece of Beef or Pork, but what he himſelf, or any other Sea-faring Man, might make a hearty Din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner on; but that poſſibly ſuch as were all their Days accuſtomed to nothing elſe but freſh Proviſions, could not think ſo well of it.</p>
            <p>Now, after ſo poſitive and ſolemn Declarations made by the Perſon who, of all Men living, ſhould (and I believe does) know beſt what was under his own immediat Care, I muſt beg leave to ſay, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but grate upon the Spirit of any good Man, to find with what an intolerable Liberty <hi>Malice, Envy</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> have, as it were,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:63768:12"/>
combined together to derogat from the juſt Merit of thoſe Noble and Worthy Perſons, who are concerned in the Management of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, by endeavouring to aſperſe their Conduct, as if (forſooth) they had acted like ſo many Fools or Knaves, or both; when, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, by what is already ſaid, it may evidently appear to any Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced and Impartial Judge: That (conſidering the Novelty of the Undertaking, the many unexpected Difficulties they met with, the Odneſs of the Tools they were oblig'd to make uſe of, the Slowneſs of Payments from the Subſcribers, and the Faintneſs of any Countenance they had from Authority) they have acquitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their Truſt, far beyond what could be reaſonably expected from (perhaps) any Sett of Men in the Nation: And I dare con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently averr, That ſome of them have often neglected their own privat Affairs and Intereſt by their cloſe Attendance and unwearied Endeavours to promote that of the Company; without the leaſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of having any Immediat or Particular Advantage thereby, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the Glory of being the Chief Inſtruments for laying the Foundation of, and Carrying on, ſo Great and Good a Work, for the General advantage and Credit of the Nation, as well as for the Particular Benefit of the Adventurers. And the Matter being ſo; I hope, no Good Man will think it Preſumptuous in me to ſay, that it may, perhaps, be thought ſome kind of Reflection on the Juſtice of a Nation, that the unbridled Licentiouſneſs of ſome Peoples Tongues and Pens againſt them, ſhould paſs ſo long unpuniſhed; when there's nothing more certain, than that Impunity hardens and confirms Men in their Wickedneſs: For Proof whereof, we ſee that ſome of thoſe Perſons who firſt begun to vent their Malice againſt the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, only by Whiſpers and ſlye Inſinuations, ſtick not now to break out into open Exclamations; Magnifying their own Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Spirits (forſooth) as if they had foreſeen all the Misfortunes that muſt neceſſarly have attended the Affairs of a Company, that was under ſuch Management; making even the very Wiſeſt, and moſt Conſiderat Actions of the Directors Conduct, the Subject of their
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63768:12"/>
Buffoonry and Ridicule; And that they may the better, not only impoſe on the credulous and ignorant Multitude; but alſo diſtract and confound the Judgement of even Diſcreet and Unbyaſs'd Perſons, they make it their daily Divertiſement, firſt to hatch, and then give Wing, to an indefinit Number of detracting and ſlanderous Stories, that have as little of Truth in them, as the Authors have of either Probity, Honour or Honeſty: And knowing that theſe ſpurious Brats of their own Invention, cannot poſſibly be long Lif'd, becauſe a very ſhort Period of Time muſt, of Courſe, neceſſarly demonſtrat their Falſehood, they providently take care to have whole Troops of them ready at Command, to ſucceed one to another, thereby to amuſe the Brain-ſick Multitude, with continued falſe Alarms; and having already, by ſuch Means, declared themſelves ſo openly Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, not only to the Directors, but to the Undertaking in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, they think (it ſeems) that ſince they cannot Reaſonably expect to regain their loſt Credit with the Company, they had beſt (according to the common Courſe of the moſt Wicked of all Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners) endeavour to juſtifie always one Crime by another greater than it ſelf: And <hi>Juvenal</hi> aludes very conciſely to ſuch ſort of Men, in his 6<hi>th</hi> Satyr.

            <p>As to the ſecond Objection, concerning Advice-Boats not being ſent directly from hence to the Colony; It is an eaſy Matter, after an Accident is over, to propoſe ſuch a Remedy, as might have prevented that Accident: But who could have dream'd of ſuch Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, unleſs we had been at open and declared War with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?</hi> And in the Name of Wonder! who could ever have imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that ſuch Rigorous Proclamations, or indeed any at all, ſhould be iſſued forth againſt us, in the Name of our own Sovereign, who gave our Company firſt a Being, and of whoſe Protection, we had all poſſible Aſſurance, not only, in common, with the reſt of the Nation, as we are his Subjects, but in a very ſpecial manner, by the Conceſſions of his Royal Grant, by Letters Patent under the Great Seal of this Kingdom, as well as by three ſeveral Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in favours of our Company.</p>
            <p>By the firſt of which, namely the 32<hi>d.</hi> Act of the 4<hi>th.</hi> Seſſion of this current Parliament: <q>It is ſpecially provided for the Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of ſuch, as ſhould become Adventurers by Joint-Stock in carrying on of Trade to the <hi>Eaſt</hi> or <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> or to the Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> That if, in their Endeavours for the Advancing and Promoting of Trade to any of the ſaid Parts, they ſhould happen to be attack'd, violently ſeized, or otherways diſturbed by Perſons not in open War with Their Majeſties; That then, and in that Caſe, Their Majeſties would be pleaſed to order, that the Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the Ships and Goods ſo ſeized, or otherways moleſted and hindred, be carried on and proſecuted by publick Means, and at publick Expenſe.</q>

By the 32<hi>d.</hi> Act of the 4<hi>th.</hi> Seſſion of this current Parliament, <q>The ſaid Company is not only Impowered to Equip, Fit, Set out, Freight and Navigat their own, or hired Ships, in Warlike or other manner, as they ſhall think fit, to any Lands, Iſlands, Countreys or Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in <hi>Aſia, Africa</hi> or <hi>America:</hi> and there to plant Colonies, build Cities, Towns, or Forts in, or upon, any Place or Places not Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited, or in, or upon, any other Place, by Conſent of the Natives and Inhabitants thereof, the ſame not being poſſeſ'd by any <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean</hi> Sovereign, Potentat, Prince or State; and by Force of Arms to defend their Trade and Navigation: As alſo to make Repriſals, and to ſeek and take Reparation of Dammages done by Sea or by Land, and to make and conclude Treaties of Peace and Commerce, with the Sovereigns, Princes, States, Rulers, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours or Proprietors of the aforeſaid Lands, Iſlands, Countreys or Places, in <hi>Aſia, Africa</hi> or <hi>America;</hi>
               </q> But alſo, His Majeſty, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt ſeveral other conſiderable Conceſſions, is graciouſly plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to promiſe, <q>that if contrary to the Rights, Liberties, Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Exemptions or Agreements mentioned in the ſaid Act, or contrary to the general Treaties of Peace and Commerce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween His Majeſty and any Potentat, Prince or State, in Amity with His Majeſty, the Ships, Goods, Merchandiſe, Perſons or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Effects whatſoever belonging to the ſaid Company, ſhould happen to be ſtopt, detain'd, embezel'd or away taken, or in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſort prejudg'd or damnified, that His Majeſty would interpoſe his Royal Authority to have Reſtitution, Reparation, and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction made, for the Dammage done, and that upon the publick Charge.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And by the 3<hi>d.</hi> Act in favours of the Company, namely the 42<hi>d.</hi> Act of the 5<hi>th.</hi> Seſſion of this current Parliament, <q>It is ſpecially ſtatute and declared, that, for the Encouragement of <hi>the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of</hi> Scotland <hi>Trading to</hi> Africa <hi>and the</hi> Indies, it ſhould be lawful to the Magiſtrats and others, the Adminiſtrators of the common
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:63768:14"/>
Good of Burrows; as alſo, to the Deacon, Maſters, and other Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrators whatſoever of any Incorporation, or Body, or Company in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporat or Collegiat within this Kingdom, to adventure, and put in, Money belonging to their reſpective Adminiſtrations, in the Stock of the ſaid Company:</q> Which they could not warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably do without ſome ſuch Act.</p>
            <p>And ſeing the whole Body of the Royal-Burrows, and the moſt conſiderable other Incorporations and Bodies Collegiat in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, as well as many Noblemen, Gentlemen, and particular Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes did, upon the Faith of thoſe Acts, become Adventurers in the Joint-Stock of this Company, it were almoſt an abſurd thing in the Directors, (eſpecially when perhaps all the Money they were then Maſters of, was not ſufficient to anſwer the Company's preſſing Occaſions) to have been at the trouble &amp; expenſe of ſetting up Packet-Boats, as a Remedy againſt the Effects of Proclamations, which, I may ſay, would have been undutiful in them to have dreaded.</p>
            <p>But yet, to let you ſee the Effects of thoſe Proclamations, even in point of bare Correſpondence; I do aſſure you, that ſeveral of the Company's Packets directed to the <hi>Council</hi> of their Colony, under cover to particular Friends in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations of <hi>America,</hi> are to this Hour lying in the Hands of thoſe Friends; who wrote back hither, <q>That by Reaſon of the Strictneſs and Severity of thoſe Proclamations, they durſt not venture to foreward the ſaid Pac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets to the Colony; becauſe, if they ſhould happen to be diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in holding any ſuch Correſpondence (as Ten to One but they would) the leaſt that they could expect, was Confinement, and to be afterwards ſined at the next Grand Seſſion, by the Diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a Jury, and that the Diſcretion of that Jury would be dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the degree of Love they bear our Country, and the Wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es they have to the Proſperity of an Undertaking of this Nature.</q> By which it is plain, That the Proclamations have put a ſtop to the Colony's getting Intelligence from hence, and that if no ſuch Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations had been iſſued forth, there had been no ſuch indiſpenſible
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:63768:14"/>
Neceſſity for Packet-Boats, to have been ſent directly from hence to the Colony, at leaſt before the Directors had an account of their Settlement, as ſome mighty Pretenders will tell us now there was.</p>
            <p>And yet nevertheleſs, it's evident by what has been already ſaid, that the Directors did poſitively intend to have diſpatched a Veſſel with Advice and Proviſions to the Colony very ſoon after their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from <hi>Leith;</hi> and for that end, uſed all other endeavours by Petition, and otherwiſe, to have procured one or two of the ſmall Friggots, which are ſtill lying uſeleſs in <hi>Bruntiſland-Harbour,</hi> as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fitteſt they could think of, for that Purpoſe; and in regard that the Parliament was pleas'd to order the building of thoſe Frig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots for the Security and Advantage of the Trade of the Kingdom, and that the Concluſion of the General Peace, took away all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Occaſion for them in the narrow Seas, it was thought they could not be otherwiſe ſo well imploy'd, as in carrying on and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the Deſigns and Intereſt of this Company, eſpecially ſince the Eſtates of Parliament, by their Addreſs, formerly recited, were pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to expreſs a ſingular Concern for it's Proſperity and Welfare. And if the Directors ſaid Petition had been ſeconded, as well as was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and that they had got the Uſe of all or any of the ſaid Frig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, there had been, in all probability, no ſuch occaſion of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour againſt them, as now there is, for not having ſent any Ships directly from hence to the Colony, ſoon enough, with Proviſions and Intelligence.</p>
            <p>But nevertheleſs, 'tis likewiſe evident, by what has been already narrated, that upon the Directors loſing Hopes of procuring any of the ſaid Friggots, they came to a poſitive Reſolution of diſpatching a ſmall Veſſel, directly from hence to the Colony, with Advice and Proviſions, in the Month of <hi>January</hi> at furtheſt; tho', as croſs Fate would have it, ſhe happen'd to be ſuch a Ship, as could not well be fitted out for ſuch a Voyage, in ſome Months time thereafter: Upon diſcovery whereof, they fitted another ſmall Veſſel, which ſail'd from <hi>Clyde</hi> in the Month of <hi>February,</hi> but was unluckily Shipwrack'd
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:63768:15"/>
by a violent Storm on the Weſt-Coaſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> as I have former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly narrated.</p>
            <p>Yet ſtill there are ſome, who (right or wrong) will have the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement bear the ſole Blame of all the Miſ-fortunes that have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd to the Company and Colony, and ſtick not to ſay too, that the Colony's coming away, in the manner they did, was not occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion'd ſo much by the Effects of thoſe Proclamations, as by the Treachery and Villainy of ſome of their own Number.</p>
            <p>Well, let us for once ſuppoſe there was Treachery in the Caſe; does that leſſen the Effects of thoſe Proclamations? No certainly, but rather aggravates: For if there was any Treachery in the caſe, theſe Proclamations gave the Traitors a better Handle to work by, than any other Pretence they could have made uſe of.</p>
            <p>I would gladly know further, whether we can ſuppoſe there could be Treachery, without ſuppoſing at the ſame time, that ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or other muſt have brib'd the Traitor? And if ſo, it ſeems na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to believe, that none would be ſo ready to do that, as ſome of thoſe who were concerned in iſſuing forth thoſe Proclamations: So that ſtill we are cloven to pieces with a Wedge of the ſame Timber.</p>
            <p>Nay further, what if (notwithſtanding of thoſe Proclamations) the Colony had never budged, but remained ſtill in their Settlement, in a flouriſhing Condition; and that they had been in ſuch Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that the Proclamations could have done them no Harm? Shall any Man therefore mantain, that the iſſuing forth of thoſe Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations was a good and harmleſs Thing? Sure no Man has Face enough to ſay ſo: For, their having, or not having, the deſign'd Effect, could not at all alter the Nature or Intention of them.</p>
            <p>But really, for my part, I cannot conceive how it could be poſſible, for a Colony, conſiſting of the King of <hi>Britain</hi>'s Subjects, to have been in any ſuch good circumſtances, but that thoſe Proclamations muſt neceſſarly have done them a vaſt prejudice, if not ruin'd them: For, ſuppoſe that in the Month of <hi>May</hi> laſt, when they got the firſt Copy of the <hi>Jamaica</hi>-Proclamation, they had been all in perfect
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:63768:15"/>
Health and Vigour, and had had plenty of freſh Proviſions, ſtrong Liquors, and all other Neceſſaries whatſoever, lying by them in ſtore; What then? Muſt they not have ſeen at firſt view, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that by the ſaid Proclamation <hi>they were declared to have actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally broken the Peace entred into with his Majeſty's Allies, by ſettling at</hi> Darien; and that therefore they muſt expect to have been treated as Pyrates? Muſt they not have conſidered, that tho' the ſaid Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was emitted againſt them in the King of <hi>England</hi>'s Name only, that yet the ſame perſon was King of <hi>Scotland</hi> alſo; and that the Matter being ſo, they could have but ſmall Hopes of being vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly protected by the King of <hi>Scotland</hi> againſt the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s Proclamations? Muſt they not have conſidered, that their then declared Enemies, the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> would undoubtedly be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by encouraged to purſue their Ends againſt them with greater Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and much more Vigor, than perhaps otherways they durſt have done? Muſt they not have conſidered, that upon every the leaſt Diſcontent or capricious Humor of any of their own People, this Proclamation would be made uſe of as a Handle to be very troubleſome and uneaſy to the reſt of the Colony? (as indeed it has been to their ſad Experience) Muſt they not think, that ſince the ſaid Proclamation was publiſhed in his Majeſty's Name, that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly it muſt needs have been legally founded upon ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Law, tho' they knew nothing of it? And muſt not the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of all theſe together, have diſtracted and confounded the Thoughts, Reſolutions, and Meaſures of any Sett of Men that could have been in the Colony? unleſs they had unanimouſly reſolved to have turn'd Pyrates indeed; and to have caſt off all manner of Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yalty and Obedience to his Majeſty; And in that ſame caſe, they muſt have reſolved to have been diſ-own'd by <hi>Scotland,</hi> as well as by <hi>England:</hi> And if ſo, pray from whom then muſt they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected Protection?</p>
            <p>And here I cannot ſuffer my ſelf to paſs by, without taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of ſome Perſons, who would pretend to palliat or skin over
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:63768:16"/>
any thing that may relate to thoſe Proclamations, upon a Suggeſtion, as if they had been (forſooth) neceſſarly emitted in compliance with, and in proſecution of, an alledged <hi>Engliſh</hi> Act of Parliament; and that therefore any particular Perſon or Perſons, cannot well be quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relled for the ſame: Which being a Suggeſtion that cannot well be obviated, without having recourſe to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Acts of Parliament; and but few People here having occaſion to be acquainted with them, I reckon it may not be thought much amiſs to touch ſuch of them, as can any ways relate to the Matter in hand, and ſhall therefore do it as ſuccinctly as I can.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Every Body knows, that by the</hi> Engliſh <hi>Act of Navigation, 12.</hi> Car. <hi>2.</hi> Cap. <hi>18.</hi> It is Enacted, that no Goods ſhall be imported into, or exported out of, any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> in other Veſſels than ſuch as belong only to the People of <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> or <hi>Wales,</hi> or Town of <hi>Berwick,</hi> or any of the ſaid Plantations; and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Maſter and three Fourths of the Mariners ſhall be <hi>Engliſh,</hi> under the Pains and Penalties mention'd in the ſaid Act. <hi>Since which time, neither we, nor the People of any other Nation, can pretend to any Right, or Freedom of Trade and Commerce, with the ſaid Plantations, except in Ships qualified as above: So that the having of any ſuch Freedom, is what the Company never contended for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By the very ſame Act, <hi>It is likewiſe ſpecially Enacted, that no Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars, Tobacco, Cotton-Wool, Indicoes, Ginger, Fuſtick, or any other Dying Wood, of the Growth of any</hi> Engliſh <hi>Plantations in</hi> America, <hi>ſhall be tranſported to any Place, other than to ſome</hi> Engliſh <hi>Plantation, or to</hi> England, Ireland, Wales, <hi>or Town of</hi> Berwick, <hi>on pain to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit both Ship and Cargo.</hi> And this being a particular Enumeration of the ſeveral Commodities, which are prohibited by the ſaid Act to be tranſported into any Place or Plantation belonging to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners; it follows of Conſequence, That all manner of Proviſions, and other Neceſſaries whatſoever, which were not prohibited by the ſaid Act, might be tranſported from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, in Ships qualified as aforeſaid, whetherſoever the Maſter ſhould think fitt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:63768:16"/>
And that it has been, all along, the conſtant Practice of ſuch Maſters, as Sail commonly from <hi>New-England, New-York,</hi> and the other Northernmoſt Plantations of <hi>America,</hi> to do ſo, is what, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, none that knows any thing of that Trade will deny: And tho', upon Complaints made, in the Year 1695, to the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> of ſome Frauds and Abuſes committed in the Plantation-Trade, contrary to the Act above-recited, they thought fit to ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>induce ſome new Act, with very ſtrict Clauſes, to inforce, and put in Practice, the true Intent and Meaning of the ſaid firſt Act; yet I dare adventure to ſay, that no Man can let me ſee an Act of the Parliament of <hi>England,</hi> laying any ſuch Reſtraint on the Inhabitants of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> as that they cannot carry or ſell Proviſions to any Forreign Place or Plantation whatſoever: Which makes the Hardſhips of theſe Proclamations ſtill the greater in this, that we, who are His Majeſty's own Subjects, ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the common Benefit of having our Colony ſupplied with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſels, in the ordinary way of Commerce; while, at the ſame time, it is moſt certain, that neither the <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Curacao,</hi> the <hi>Danes</hi> at <hi>St. Thomas,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>St. Chriſtophers, Martinico, Petitguavis,</hi> or <hi>Hiſpanio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> nor the <hi>Portuguiſe</hi> at the <hi>Maderas,</hi> or <hi>Teſſera-Iſlands,</hi> were, ever to this Hour, denyed the Benefit thereof, except in the Caſe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared War: And even then too, the ſelling them Proviſions, and perhaps ſome other Merchandiſe likewiſe, is often wink't at; as is at this time, the carrying of Proviſions, Negro's and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, to ſeveral parts of the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Dominions in the <hi>Weſt-Indies:</hi> So that, to our Comfort, we are the only Nation under Heaven, (that I could ever yet hear of) againſt whom any ſuch Proclamations have been publiſhed by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in their <hi>American</hi> Plantations.</p>
            <p>Nor was it thought enough, that, upon the firſt Orders ſent from <hi>England,</hi> dated, as I am informed, the ſecond Day of <hi>January</hi> 1698/9, the ſaid Proclamations, againſt our Colony, were publiſhed
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63768:17"/>
in <hi>Barbados</hi> and <hi>Jamaica</hi> in the Month of <hi>April,</hi> and in all the other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, in ſome ſhort time thereafter; But that, upon ſecond Orders, a ſecond Fleece of Proclamations ſhould be likewiſe publiſhed by the ſame Perſons, and in the ſame Places, to let the World ſee that the firſt were not grounded upon Miſtake, but that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to make their Putt good: For upon the 5th day of <hi>September</hi> laſt, a ſecond Proclamation, pretty near in Subſtance with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, was publiſhed in <hi>Barbados;</hi> and ſome of thoſe lately come from <hi>New-York,</hi> in the Company's Ship the <hi>Caledonia,</hi> do Report, That three or four Days before they ſet ſail from thence, there were freſh Orders arriv'd at <hi>New-England,</hi> for emitting and publiſhing ſecond Proclamations in thoſe parts, againſt our Colony; which gives us ſufficient ground to believe that like Orders were ſent to all the other Plantations.</p>
            <p>Yet ſuch as have a Mind to be Talking, will always find ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to Amuſe the Multitude withal, be it never ſo little to the purpoſe: And thus we find ſome People ſtill urging, that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of thoſe Proclamations, ſome Inhabitants in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, who are Zealous Well-Wiſhers to this Undertaking, have, ſince the Publication of thoſe Proclamations, ſent ſome Sloops and Brigantines to the <hi>Colony;</hi> and that therefore the Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were not the Occaſion of the <hi>Colony's</hi> coming away from <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en,</hi> but that the ſame proceeded from other Cauſes; and that if the <hi>Colony</hi> had ſtaid ſtill, and maintain'd their Settlement, more Sloops and Brigantines would, beyond all peradventure, be ſent to them from time to time, till the Company's own Ships ſhould arrive there.</p>
            <p>Well! All this is very plauſible; and I think our Nation, as well as the Company, is very much beholden to the Generous and Kind Inclinations of thoſe Gentlemen, who ventured any part of their own Intereſt ſo frankly, to ſupport that of the Company or Colony: But, as it happen'd, Pray what was the Colony the better for it? Did any of thoſe Sloops or Brigantins arrive at <hi>Darien,</hi> before the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63768:17"/>
Colony's Departure thence? Or had the Colony ſo much as the leaſt Advice, that any ſuch Veſſels were a-coming to them? No certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I ſuppoſe no Man can or will ſay ſo; And without that, they ſay nothing at all: For, how mean ſoever my Opin on may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be of the Colony's Conduct and Reſolution, not only upon that unlucky Occaſion, but in other Reſpects too: Yet I have ſo much Charity, as to believe ſincerely, that if they had expected any ſuch Veſſels to have come to them with Proviſions, in any reaſonable time, or if they had known, that they had any ſuch real Friends and Well-Wiſhers in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations, as it ſeems they had, or that Supplies and Recruits were ſo near them coming from <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that they would not have come away from <hi>Darien,</hi> at leaſt, before they had had ſome certain and poſitive Orders from the Company, how to behave with relation to thoſe Proclamations: But ſo it is, to their own and the Company's Sorrow, as well as the Nations Diſgrace, whatever may be the Occaſion of it, away, you ſee, they are come, as ill Luck would have it:
<q>
                  <l>Quae volunt Fata, non tollunt Vota.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Directors having received certain Intelligence of this Tragical and Unexpected Emergency, they laid the whole Matter in Writing before the Council-General of the Company; who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon thought fit, in moſt Dutiful and Humble Manner, to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the ſame to His Majeſty, by their Petition of the 29<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> laſt, wherein they ſeem to intimat, that without ſome ſpecial Teſtimonies and Evidence of His Majeſty's Gracious Favour, and Royal Protection, as well as the Aſſiſtance of a Parliament, they could not well expect, but that the beſt of their Endeavours, for carrying on and ſupporting an Undertaking of this Nature, muſt prove altogether vain: And therefore, their Petition conſiſted brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of two Articles, 1ſt. <hi>That His Majeſty would be graciouſly pleaſed to take off the Force and Effects of theſe Proclamations; And,</hi> 2dly, <hi>That His Majeſty would allow the Parliament to meet in</hi> November <hi>laſt,</hi> it being adjourn'd till that time.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:63768:18"/>
They at the ſame time Addreſs'd His Majeſty's moſt Honourable Privy Council, with relation to the Contents of their ſaid Petition to His Majeſty; But what the Privy Council did therein, I know not: And as for His Majeſty's Anſwer to the ſaid Petition, you have already ſeen it, ſo I ſhall not preſume to make any Comments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.</p>
            <p>However the Council-General of the Company having, it ſeems, about the beginning of this Month, reſolved to Addreſs His Majeſty, in a moſt Dutiful Manner, upon an other Head; And conſidering, that none of their former Addreſſes or Petitions had ſuch Succeſs, as they could have wiſh'd for, and that they were all tranſmitted, in the ordinary way, to the Secretary of State, in waiting for the time; they reſolved to ſend this Addreſs by one of their own Number, who ſhould, at the ſame time, have particular Inſtructions with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Contents of their former Petitions, and ſhould carry along with him Letters to the Secretaries of State, intimating his Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and entreating their Concurrence.</p>
            <p>Whether this Method may produce better Effects than their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, I know not; but ſome People are pleaſed to prognoſticat, that if in this as well as in former Ages, there ſhould happen to be any ſuch Favourites or Courtiers near his Majeſties Perſon, as may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps endeavour to make a Monopoly of the King's Ear, that it will never be pleaſing to ſuch to ſee any Corn paſs by their own Mills; and that therefore they may readily endeavour to give it a State-Turn: But until I ſee it, I ſhall never ſuffer my ſelf to believe any ſuch thing; for as the King is a Gracious Prince, ſo his Ears will be equally o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to all his People.</p>
            <p>I am informed, That the <hi>Weſt India</hi> Merchants, or at leaſt their Agents at <hi>London,</hi> are now preparing a Repreſentation to be made (if not already done) complaining that the Proclamations which were publiſhed in the Plantations, ſtrictly forbidding them to carry or ſell Proviſions or other Neceſſaries to the <hi>Scots</hi> Colony, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to their Rights and Liberties, and prejudicial to their Intereſts; and that the Friends of the ſeveral Governours, who publiſh'd thoſe
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63768:18"/>
Proclamations happening to hear thereof, are endeavouring to ſtif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle theſe Complaints as much as they can: But what Truth there may be in this, a little time muſt ſhew.</p>
            <p>I am likewiſe juſt now told, that his Majeſty has been graciouſly pleaſed to declare that he knew nothing of thoſe <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, till he had ſeen Copies of them come from thence: And if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it be true, that his Majeſty has ſaid ſo (as I hope it is) I rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon it would be no very hard Matter to name ſome few Perſons who have a great deal to anſwer for.</p>
            <p>I remember the judicious <hi>Montaigne,</hi> in his political Eſſays, obſerves it, as a Misfortune commonly incident to a Nation that is under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a Prince living in another Country, That any Nation ſo ſtated, is ſeldom or never Govern'd according to the real Inclination of the Prince, or the true Intereſt of the People; ſo much as according to the Humors, Affections, and Deſigns of his Miniſters: For that he ſeeing only with their Eyes, and hearing but withtheir Ears, cannot poſſibly know the true State, Condition and Intereſt of a Diſtant Nation, nor the Humors and Inclinations of its Inhabitants, any thing near ſo well as if he lived amongſt them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Seneca</hi> in his Treatiſe of Benefits, puts the Queſtion, <hi>Quid omnia poſſidentibus deeſt?</hi> What can a Man want that has every thing? And he anſwers himſelf, <hi>Ille qui verum dicat.</hi> One that will tell him the Truth. And really of all Men living, I think Kings and Princes ſtand moſt in need of having ſuch Men near their Perſons.</p>
            <p>And I wiſh, from my Heart, That all thoſe who, at any time, have occaſion to be at the Helm of publick Affairs in any Kingdom or State whatſoever, would ſeriouſly conſider what the Learned and wiſe Stateſman; <hi>Sir Francis Bacon</hi> obſerves by way of Precaution, in his Judicious and Celebrated Eſſays. <q>As for Diſcontentments (ſays he) they are in the politick Body like to Humors in the Natural, which are apt to gather preter-natural Heat, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame. And let no Prince meaſure the Danger of them by this, whether they be Juſt or Unjuſt: For that were to imagine People
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:63768:19"/>
to be too Reaſonable, who do often Spurn at their own Good: Nor yet by this, whether the Griefs whereupon they riſe, be in Fact great or ſmall; for they are the moſt dangerous Diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where the Fear is greater than the Feeling. <hi>Dolendi mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, Timendi non item.</hi> Beſides, in great Oppreſſions, the ſame things that provoke the Patience, do withal mate the Courage; but in Fears it is not ſo. Neither let any Prince or State be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure concerning Diſcontentments, becauſe they have been often, or have been long; and yet no Peril hath enſued: For as it is true, that every Vapour or Fume doth not turn into a Storm; ſo it is nevertheleſs true, that Storms, tho' they blow over divers times, yet may fall at laſt: And as the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Proverb noteth well, <hi>The Cord breaketh at the laſt, by the weakeſt Pull.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>One Material Paſſage I had almoſt forgot: Upon the firſt Advice that the Council-General of the Company had of the Colony's ſafe Arrival and Settlement in <hi>Darien,</hi> they gave His Majeſty an Account thereof, by a very Dutiful Letter, bearing Date at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> the 31<hi>ſt.</hi> Day of <hi>March</hi> laſt, wherein they particularly condeſcended upon its being <q>a Place Uninhabited, and never before poſſeſs'd by any <hi>European</hi> Prince or State whatſoever, and that upon the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and with the Conſent of the Neighbouring Natives, they Landed and Settled there,</q> (which conſequently made it a Place preciſely in the Terms of His Majeſty's Acts of Parliament and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patent) <q>And withal, that they were poſitively informed, that the <hi>French</hi> had a Deſign upon all that Coaſt, or at leaſt to make a Settlement ſome where thereabouts; And therefore hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly offered to His Majeſty's Conſideration, how that the firm Settlement of the <hi>Scots</hi> Colony there, might be a Means of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting, or at leaſt, leſſening the evil Conſequences that might ariſe to His Majeſty's Kingdoms and Dominions every where, by the Settlement of any powerful Forreign Neighbour in, upon, or near any part of that Coaſt; And therefore confidently expected His Majeſty's Royal Favour and Protection, in the Maintainanee
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:63768:19"/>
of ſuch an Important Settlement, as having, in all the Steps of their Conduct, through the whole Courſe of this Affair, ſtrictly obſerved the Conditions required by the ſaid Acts of Parliament, and Letters Patent.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And in another Letter, at the ſame time, to both the Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of State, they have, amongſt ſeveral other Particulars, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Paragraph: <q>As to the <hi>French</hi> Deſigns of ſettling thereabouts, (meaning on the Coaſt of <hi>Darien)</hi> "it is a Point not to be doubted of; for, in order thereunto, they have already been Tampering with ſeveral of the Natives, ſome of whom they have endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have carried into <hi>France;</hi> and we have very good reaſon to believe, that a further Progreſs had been made in that Matter before now, were it not the dayly Expectations which that Court had of the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Death. Which, we humbly conceive, is a Matter worthy of His Majeſty's Conſideration, and of no ſmall Concern to the Intereſt of his whole Dominions, tho' this Nation, and our Company, may ſeem to be more immediatly intereſted at preſent.</q>
            </p>
            <p>And to certifie further, That the <hi>French</hi> deſigns upon that Coaſt did not conſiſt in Imagination only; Mr. <hi>Paterſon,</hi> one of the Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of the Colony, and <hi>Captain Robert Drummond,</hi> Commander of one of the Company's Ships the <hi>Caledonia,</hi> have, by Declaration un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Hands, ſignified to the Directors, the Contents of a Letter written in <hi>March</hi> laſt, by the Governour of <hi>Portobell</hi> to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of a <hi>French</hi> Sloop, which was imployed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to perſwade the <hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>Samballo</hi>'s to join againſt the <hi>Scots</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny at <hi>Caledonia.</hi> The Letter was written in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> and found in a Bottle by ſome of our Colony on board of the ſaid Sloop, near the <hi>Samballos,</hi> where ſhe was left deſerted and owned by no Body; and the Contents of the ſaid Letter is in Subſtance as followeth. <hi>Sir, I have received Advice from</hi> Monſieur Du Caſs, <hi>Governour of</hi> Petitgua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis, <hi>wherein he aſſures me, that rather than fail, he will come himſelf in Perſon; but however, he will ſend four Friggots to aſſiſt us in rioting</hi>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:63768:20"/>
               <hi>the Scots out of</hi> Darien. <hi>You may aſſure</hi> Ambroſio, Corbet, Pedro, <hi>and the reſt of the</hi> Indians <hi>of the</hi> Samballos, <hi>That if they continue to help, and keep Correſpondence with the</hi> Scots, <hi>that not only the</hi> Spaniards, <hi>but likewiſe the</hi> French, <hi>will revenge it upon them: But if on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they will join with us to deſtroy and root out theſe</hi> Scots, <hi>they ſhall be well rewarded and gratified for their Pains.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall make no Reflections on this Matter, nor ſhall I pretend to Propheſy; but any one of but an ordinary reach in Speculation, may eaſily ſee, that it's very poſſible there may be ſuch a Juncture of time, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation may come to wiſh, that this Company had never met with ſuch unreaſonable Obſtructions in the proſecution of their Deſigns, as they have done: Nor am I out of Hopes of ſeeing, perhaps, ſome of the wiſeſt Men of our Neighbouring Nation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo ſenſible of the Folly, as well as the Injuſtice of the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable Treatment which the Company met with, that they may think it their Intereſt, even to contribute to the Mantenance of ſuch an important Settlement on that <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> which now affords ſo much Matter of Speculation to the moſt conſiderable Courts in <hi>Europe.</hi>

            <p>Now if it ſhould ſo happen, that through the Stupid Ignorance of ſome, the Supine Neglect and Indifference of others, the Induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Suggeſtions and Malicious Detractions of a Third, the Dreaming Deluſions and Imaginary Fears of a Fourth, the Servile and Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary

Backwardneſs of a Fifth, or the Humorſom Factions and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of a Sixth Sort of People, the Body of the Nation ſhould be diſcouraged from concurring unanimouſly, in repreſenting the whole Nations Concern in this Matter to His Majeſty, and in endeavouring to procure ſome Gracious Marks of His Majeſty's Royal Favour and Protection to the Company; Or if that, through the want thereof, together with the Company's other Misfortunes, the Deſigns of ſo Noble, Great and Generous an Undertaking ſhould happen to be fruſtrated, and that ſo many brave Men as are lately ſent to maintain the Company's Settlement in <hi>Darien,</hi> ſhould periſh in the Deſign (which God forbid) as moſt of thoſe that went on the firſt Expedition did; then may we juſtly expoſtulat with Heaven in the Words of the Royal Pſalmiſt upon an other Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, <hi>Thou makeſt us a Reproach to our Neighbours, a Scorn and a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion to them that are round about us.
