            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>GIVE ear, O King, and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles all, to this my new true Song,</l>
                  <l>The Living God is all in all, his Truth is very strong,</l>
                  <l>Truth will defend, world without end, those that are Innocent.</l>
                  <l>The Man that walketh in the Truth hath no cause to repent.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>A mighty Wonder hath bin wrought by God in fair <hi>England,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>He hath delivered the King by his almighty Hand,</l>
                  <l>Traytors did seek to take away his LIFE, as is made known,</l>
                  <l>But their damn'd Treason is found out, GOD hath them overthrown.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Their dark design is brought to light, for all Traytors must fall;</l>
                  <l>Their is no Treason in the Truth, for truth is Lord of All:</l>
                  <l>Its Truth that maketh Treason fly, truth is a noble thing,</l>
                  <l>The Devil's in that man indeed that wo'd destroy a King.</l>

                  <l>Your secret Foes God will beat down, and break them all asunder:</l>
                  <l>Your preservation stands in God, who will bring traytors under.</l>
               </lg>

                  <l>How often hath the Lord bin pleased your Body to deliver:</l>
                  <l>Then praise the living God, ô King, that you may live for ever:</l>
                  <l>Great hath his Kindness bin to you, he is your strong Defender,</l>
                  <l>Give up your Mind unto the Lord, that Kingdom he doth tender.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>When you was compassed about with Fiery Enemies,</l>
                  <l>The Lord appeared in great power, and did their Host surprise.</l>
                  <l>He led you by a gentle hand, sent you out of their way,</l>
                  <l>And at his pleasure brought you home, remember such a day!</l>

                  <l>The hand of Divine Providence, hath guided you along,</l>

                  <l>They lived and walked in the Truth, the pearl of every Land:</l>
                  <l>They praised God, and loved the King bearing the Truth within,</l>
                  <l>They had no Treason in their hearts, but in true Love did spring.</l>

                  <l>O blame me not, my Sovereign, for this poor drop of water:</l>
                  <l>It is exceeding good indeed, and from the Divine Nature.</l>
                  <l>Charity is a noble spring, in Love there is no Treason,</l>
                  <l>For Charity doth guide the mind, a long in Divine reason.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Farewel, farewel, my Master dear; consider me at leisure:</l>
                  <l>Hear I must lye asuredly, until it be your Pleasure,</l>
                  <l>To set me free, then it would bee, to us a great refreshing,</l>
                  <l>To see you enter into Love, and so receive Gods blessing.</l>
