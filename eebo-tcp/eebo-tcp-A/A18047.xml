            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I imitate the faſhions and vſances of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Perſians, vvho alwaies vvhen they ſaw their king, vvould offer vp ſomething or other that they had about them vnto him, as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken and teſtimonie of their loue, dutie, and reuerence and one day the king being abroad,

one of his ſubiects vpon the ſuddain met him, vvho hauing nothing in his hands to giue him, ran in all haſt to the vvaters ſide, and brought him both his hands full of vvater, which the king graciouſly accepted, &amp; gaue him thanks as for a greater preſent. This peece of work (Sir, may be compared to thoſe hands ful of water) being indeed of little vvorth and value, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo very haſtily performed, vvhich as it is, I of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in the fulneſſe of loue, and do deſire a fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable cenſure for the ſame: for I knovv, that as a handfull of vvater is an vnmeet preſent for a king, ſo this matter ſo ſtuft and compacted of poeticall and vaine fiction, is not altogether beſeeming the countenance ofſo graue and ſo vvorthy a perſonage. But my error herein pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedeth vvholly of my vvillingnes to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that might merit your forepaſſed fauors, and to diſcouer a good meaning of grateful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, though the meanes it ſelfe perhaps proue not grateful vnto you.

This matter now handled, was vndertaken ſuddainly, and diſpatched haſtily, for which he craueth milder constructions, &amp; in very deed had it not by an extraordinary accident hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened into the hands of a stranger, it had not now (poore father forſaken child) endured the inſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table tyranie of lawleſse cenſure.

looking on that perſpicuous and thought-amazing compoſition of the heauens, is forcibly conſtrained to beleeue, that there hath been ſome one of eternall and infinit command, that hath had that vnſpeakable wiſdome, and inexcogitable care, as firſt to compoſe, then to gouerne and diſpoſe this ſo rare and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous wonderment: and him they entearme by the name of GOD; as it were the giuer of al good things, who by his infiniteneſſe is eternal; incomprehenſible, and inuiſible. But ſuch their beleefe extended not ſo farre, nor was it ſo impreſſed in all mens hearts, as that euery one therefore attained to this ſtaineleſſe and truth-yeelding opinion. For at the firſt, the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible ſottiſhneſſe, and faith wanting weakneſſe of man was ſuch, as illuſtrating the heauens and their reuolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the earth and her encreaſe, the ſea with her ſtrange courſes, onely with the externall eies of their faces, not admitting the ſame to anie contemplation or ſoule obſeruance, the vulgars, and ſuch as blindfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded went groping vp and down in the dark for know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, were entangled in ſuch an intricate garden and Labyrinth of error, that they were firmely perſuaded that there was a god in this Statue, another in that picture of earth, ſtone, and other mettals, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in painted Images: from whence it proceeded, that there were then in ſuch friuolous and ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous reuerence, ſo innumerable multitudes of gods among the auncients. For not onely the ſeuerall hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of diuerſe Nations, but euerie particular Cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, cauſed their Image that they would worſhip, ſo to be framed, according as they were then to craue and
<pb facs="tcp:8331:5"/>
requeſt ſome eſpeciall and extraordinarie boone of their wooden deities, or hauing alreadie obtained it, entended thereby to manifeſt their thankſgiuing and gratefulneſſe. And being (as it were) rockt aſleep with the pleaſing conceit of this their ſuperſtition, it grew ſo farre vpon them, that in the end they worſhipped and deuoutly adored men like vnto themſelues, ſuch as were knowne to haue inuented and found out ſome ſpeciall good and adiuvament for their eaſie and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et liuing, or to haue (as it were) hewen out and forced from their deepe-ſearching capacities ſome ſtrange and vncouth art, ſcience, or profeſſion. And to theſe men were erected and dedicated excellent grauen ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, in whoſe curious architecturie all thoſe good things and deeds which they deuiſed or atcheeued here among men, were liuely and exactly ſet forth and interſected. And although this kind of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous veneration, firmly poſſeſt the thoughts of men generally, yet vniuerſally it extended not. For there then liued, who carried an irremoueable beleefe of the ſacred deitie of one God onely, which was euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>during and inuiſible, and therefore ſhaped not to themſelues any further Image or repreſentation (which who ſo ſeekes to entertaine, walketh in the erroneous paths of ſoule-endangering ignorance.) The Iewes (which among the ancients attained nigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt vnto the ſure and infallible truth) worſhipped one God onely, and him they adored not in counterfeit and ſtone-built Statues, diſcerned onely with the eies of the body, but with the cleere-ſhining light of the mind, and were ſtill rapt with premeditating and
<pb facs="tcp:8331:6"/>
contemplatiue thoughts of his ymeuſe and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible diuinitie. And as <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, <note place="margin">Cornelius Tacitus.</note> they accounted them wicked and impious, who of themſelues would make ſuch counterſhape or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of God, compoſing in it likeneſſe and ſimilitude to the proportion of a humane and terrene bodie: and therefore neither in their Cities, nor in their Temples admitted they any ſuch vaine &amp; ſence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe adoration. <hi>Lycurgus</hi> (who in perfection and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turitie <note place="margin">Licurgus.</note> of true knowledge, did no way equalize the Iewes) would not by any meanes that there ſhould be contriued any frame or Idea of their gods, becauſe (ſayth hee) they cannot bee likened neither to man or anie other liuing creature, and being likewiſe inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, who can depicture that which his eyes neuer faw. <hi>Lactantius</hi> writeth, That the Aegiptians worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped <note place="margin">Lactantius.</note> with all deuotion the foure elements, and yet not making any Image or picture of them.

               <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> (writing of Germany) ſayth, That the Germanes not onely denied all reuerence to any pictures of their gods, but would not by any meanes ſuffer any Temples to be built or dedicated vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: ſaying, that it was very incongruent and inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to ſhut vp their deities within the wals of ſo ſmall a circuite, and that it was not a thing meet or agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for their infinite greatneſſe to bee ſhaped out to the ſmall forme and proportion of a humane bodie. As the Grecians did after that, and the Romanes, and before them the Aegyptians, who all framed their Images of their Gods to the due likeneſſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of a mans bodie. But yet they did not ſo farre ouerſhoot themſelues, as to thinke that their celeſtiall gods had either heads, hands, or feet; but to ſhew (as <hi>Varro</hi> ſayth) That the ſoule of man, which is impriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <note place="margin">Varro.</note> here in the fleſhly dungeon of the bodie, reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles the diuine ſoules, which inhabite in the celeſtiall dwellings of the heauens: and for that the mind or ſoule cannot externally bee ſeene or proportioned, they did prefigure it, and make it apparent by the ſhape of a humane bodie. <hi>Porphirius</hi> ſayth, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Porphirius.</note> reporteth, That the Images of their gods were made to the likeneſſe of men, becauſe God (ſaith he) is al ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and reaſon, whereof men, and no other creatures doe participate. <hi>Lactantius</hi> giueth another reaſon of <note place="margin">Lactantius.</note> theſe Statues, ſaying, that they were firſt made for the conſeruation of the remembrance of deceaſed kings
<pb facs="tcp:8331:7"/>
and gouernours, for the perpetuall eterniſement of their famous and memorable atcheeuements: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon <hi>Euſebius</hi> writing of the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtorie, <note place="margin">Euſebius.</note> likewiſe writeth, That it was a generall cuſtome among the Gentiles to honour the greateſt perſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and men of beſt demerit, by repreſenting their Ideas by Statues or Pictures, and ſo by that meanes keeping them as it were aliue by the memorious tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phies of their neuer-dying worthineſſe; wherby their ſucceeding poſteritie might euidently perceiue what reſpectiue regard was had and cannonized of thoſe who had in their life time adioined to their valerous approuements, ciuile and vertuous conuerſation: you ſhall read in <hi>Plinie,</hi> that in Rhodes were found at one <note place="margin">Plinie.</note> time more than three thouſand Statues, and not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny leſſe in Athens, or in Delphos, and ſo alſo in manie other places of Greece. In which fooliſh ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Rome alſo (though not ſo lately) was vnto any of thoſe nothing inferior, who had indeed gathered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſo many pictures and ſuppoſed gods, that it was ſaid, that in Rome there were another ſort of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple made of ſtone, for what pictures ſoeuer they could get, either of painters or ingrauers, they omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted no meanes to compaſſe, and with thoſe would they beautifie their houſes, not only in the Citie, but euen in their country or farme-houſes: which indeed was iudged to bee too effeminat &amp; ſoft for the ſtrict and ſeuere life of the Romanes. <hi>Lucullus</hi> (as <hi>Varro</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Lucullus.</note> writeth) had ſuch delight in ſuch Images, that almoſt euery day infinite numbers of people reſorted to his farmes in the country to ſee his ſtrange pictures and
<pb facs="tcp:8331:7"/>
curious engraued Statues. And this note the ancients obſerued, that thoſe their Images were made with a deuiſe, as when they pleaſed themſelues, they might take off their heads, and ſet them vpon others. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon <hi>Suetonius</hi> ſpeaking of the glorious and inſolent <note place="margin">Suetonius.</note> humor of <hi>Caligula,</hi> ſayth, That he perceiuing himſelfe to haue ſurpaſſed all other Princes and Gouernours his predeceſſours in greatneſſe and powerfull com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, began to ſooth himſelfe vp ſo farre in that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolencie and ſuperarrogation, that hee commanded all theſe heads of their greateſt Gods, which either for deuotion or rare workemanſhip, were moſt ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as that of Iupiter Olympius and others, ſhould be taken away, and vpon themſhould bee placed the true portraiture of his owne, moſt exquiſitely hewed and engraued. And <hi>Lambridius</hi> likewiſe ſayth, That <note place="margin">Lambridius</note> the Emperour <hi>Commodus</hi> tooke away the head from that famous and art-exceeding Image of <hi>Nero,</hi> which was ſo cutiouſly with ſuch ingenious architecturie depictured, and vpon that likewiſe commanded his owne to be erected. Not long after this, the Statuaries of Princes were ſo regarded &amp; held in ſuch reuerent embracements, as whatſoeuer (occaſioned by what meanes you will) had fled to theſe priuelegious pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, had ben freed from any purſuing danger whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer, and not to be inforced or brought away during his ſtay in that ſo regarded ſanctuarie. Onely wee read of <hi>Marcus Antonius</hi> (who as <hi>Suetonius</hi> affirmeth) fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Suetonius.</note> to the Statue of <hi>Iulius Caeſar,</hi> for his better ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, was by <hi>Auguſtus</hi> cauſed violently to bee haled from thence, and afterwards ſtopping his eares to all
<pb facs="tcp:8331:8"/>
praiers and entreaties, commanded him to bee ſlaine. The Statues of Princes were oftentimes portraied out naked, oftentimes alſo clothed, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly gloriouſly depainted with gold: as wee read with <hi>Titus Liuius,</hi> who ſaith, That <hi>Acylius Glabrio</hi> was the firſt in Italie that made any golden Statuarie, <note place="margin">Titus Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uius.</note> and after that it was generally accuſtomed through all the Country. <hi>Alexander Afrodiſeus</hi> writeth, That in <note place="margin">Alexander Afrodiſeus.</note> thoſe daies the Images of their gods, and of their princes were made as it might ſeeme naked, &amp; a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter honor therby was attributed vnto the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as of thoſe whoſe clemencie and iuſtice lay open and manifeſt vnto all men: ſignifying that Princes and Magiſtrates ought to be naked as it were, and immaculate from all corruptible vice, carrying in themſelue a chriſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line and clear conſcience, not cloked or couered with any inward miſcheef working or deceitful thoughts. Vpon anie pompeous ſolemnitie of any exerciſes and ſports, not onely the Images of their gods were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by ſeuerall turnes on mens ſhoulders, but alſo the Statues of Emperours, valerous Captaines, and farre famed commanders, were likewiſe preſented on thoſe feaſtiuals. But <hi>Alarius,</hi> in that hee was ignoble by birth, and of meane diſcent (as <hi>Saluſt</hi> ſayth) had not <note place="margin">Saluſt.</note> then to carrie any picture of his owne, nor of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, but in ſteed of thoſe, hee there manifeſted the high and condigne rewards he had receiued for theſe ſo honourable and renowned priſes which hee won, and triumphantly carried away in many gallant and victorious expeditions. Aſſuredly, the Images and Statuaries of the gods in thoſe daies were almoſt
<pb facs="tcp:8331:8"/>
innumerable, and framed into ſo many ſeueral and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit faſhions, as to endeauour to ſet them all downe, were as difficult, as blindfolded to worke my ſelfe out ofſome intricate and ſtrange-framed Labyrinth. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe whom approued and autentike Authors will warrantiſe currant and paſſible, we will now remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and yet if all other Nations had obſerued that courſe which the Aegyptians vſed, happily we might haue touched the moſt part of them. For according to the writings of <hi>Plato,</hi> in Aegypt were reſerued <note place="margin">Plato.</note> among all their moſt reuerend and ſacred reliques, thoſe engrauen or painted Images which were then alreadie framed and left vnto them from their aunce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, neuer labouring or ſtudying to inuent more, as almoſt all other Nations at that time buſied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. In Greece for the moſt part their gods were faſhioned, according as the ſeuerall humour of the people then affected, euery one enucleating thereby theirſelfe-pleaſing conceits, and inward delectations: ſo that becauſe the Lacedemonians were generally martiall people, and verie oftentimes in wars imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, their gods were alwaies depictured in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>plete armour. And the Phenicians (in that they were gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to Merchandiſes, and other worldlie gaine-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing trauels, accounting him onely bleſt that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed greateſt treaſure and abundance of wealth) cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed their gods to bee hewen out with a great ſwolne bag or purſe in each of their hands. And ſo likewiſe in diuerſe other diſcrepant faſhions, were their Statues in thoſe ages framed, according as they then belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued to be in them ſeuerall natures, powers, &amp; effects:
<pb facs="tcp:8331:9"/>
by reaſon whereof, (as <hi>Euſebius</hi> rehearſing the words of <hi>Porphirius</hi> ſaith) The ancients to make the diuerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">Porphirius.</note> of their gods appeare, depictured ſome male, and ſome female, others virgines, and others married, and ſo accordingly habited them in their agreeable veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The mettals and ſubſtance of which Statues, <hi>Euſebius</hi> (taking it from <hi>Porphirius)</hi> thus ſayth: That <note place="margin">Porphirius.</note> God being abſolutely cleere, pure-ſhining, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſcant, whoſe eies-dazelling luſtre man cannot com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend with terrene ſence, they alwaies framed his picture of the moſt fine and precious tranſparent chriſtall, and of the moſt pure and vnblemiſhed mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that they could by any meanes and by all ſtrict in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueſtigation acquire and compaſſe: ſometimes alſo they would frame his Statue of the moſt glorious gold, to ſhew the eternall and diuine fire that burneth continually where hee remaineth, and that his nature is free from all corrupted ruſtineſſe of our humane affections. Others that would haue his Statue of black ſtone, entend thereby to note his inuiſibilitie. It is written by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> That the making of theſekind of Statues, Images, and Pictures, hath been very anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> but (ſayth hee) the fathers in thoſe daies, did make them for the moſt part of wood, becauſe it ſeemed to them, that the hard and art-reſiſting mettall of ſtone was too ſtubborn and harſh a ſtuffe for them to make their gods of, and that either gold or ſiluer were too baſe, as being excrements of an vnfertile and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe ſoile, becauſe whereas the mines of thoſe met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals are found, are ſildome ſeene anie plant or root to grow: and ſuch ground as brought not forth flower,
<pb facs="tcp:8331:9"/>
hearbes, and other fruits, they held as accurſed and vnfortunate. Theſe men indeed which liued in thoſe daies, were not ſo bewitched with the enchantments of the ſweet-ſeeming, though ſoure-prouing delights of this world, nor regarded they the vſe of either ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer or gold in ſuch ineſtimable priſe, but ſtudied one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and were laborious to ſearch out ſuch life-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing commodities, as they might thereby bee fed and nouriſhed. <hi>Plato</hi> in like manner would haue ſuch Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues <note place="margin">Plato.</note> altogether of wood, For (ſaith he) the earth being a place conſecrated vnto the gods, there ought not to bee compoſed thereof any Image or Picture, ſo likewiſe neither of gold or ſiluer, for that among the poſſeſſours of thoſe mettals, there is hatched and brought forth deteſtable contentious, and malicious enuies. And <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſaynth, That ſuch glorious <note place="margin">Lactantius.</note> and gold-emboſſed Statues of their gods, did onelie ſhew the auaricious minds of men, who vnder the ſhadow of religion and deuotion, would bee continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally poſſeſſed with infinit ſtore of riches, both of gold and ſiluer, and other very precious ſtones and iewels, whereof they made them ſuch ſumptuous Images, which indeed many of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> regarded &amp; endeared, more for the ineſtimable coſt and charges beſtowed vpon them, than for anie reuerence of thoſe gods by which they were repreſented. But the opinion of <hi>Plato,</hi> as I haue ſaid, was to haue them altogether made of wood: For Yron (ſayth hee) and other ſuch hard mettals are vſed and imployed in many fatall and horrible blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die maſſacres, and are the occaſions of huge and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite ſlaughters. <hi>Tibullus</hi> ſpeaking of their domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call <note place="margin">Tibullus.</note>
               <pb facs="tcp:8331:10"/>
gods, whom they called Lares, thus ſayth of them: Maruell not you fooliſh men to ſee theſe our gods made of ſtockes of drie trees, for ſuch (ſayeth hee) in the proſperous daies of our contentfull fathers, when religion, faith, and Iuſtice were ſincerely and louingly emboſom'd, were reuerenced with truer zeale of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fained veneration, than are now adaies theſe gorge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and gold-compoſed Statues. It is written by <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie,</hi> That Images and Pictures be of great antiquitie <note place="margin">Plinie.</note> in Italie, yet they were not made of any other mettals but wood: and ſome few of ſtone, ſince Aſia was vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſallized and ſubiugated to the Romanes. And for that vnto all ſuch Statues and Images of their gods, was annexed and adioyned the picture of Eternitie, I thinke it not amiſſe in this place in ſome ſort to touch it. Although <hi>Boccace</hi> writing of the Progenie of the gods, ſayth, That the auncients haue deriued it from <note place="margin">Boccace.</note> 
               <hi>Demogorgon,</hi> as the principall and firſt of them all, and who inhabited in the middle center of the earth, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled round about, &amp; circumueſted with a dark and obfuſcate cloud, breathing from his mouth a certaine liquid humiditie: but herein I will proceed no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hauing no further warrant for ſuch depictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance: onely I will now reuert my penne to the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of Eternitie, which what it is, the name doth cleerely diſcouer, containing in it ſelfe all worlds and ages, and not limitted or meaſured by any ſpace of time: And therefore <hi>Triſmegiſtus, Plato,</hi> and the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thagorickes, called Time the Image of Eternitie: in <note place="margin">Triſmegiſt.</note> that it is reuolued in it ſelfe, and admits no date. Wherevpon for the more ample and copious mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting
<pb facs="tcp:8331:10"/>
thereof, we will heare the opinion of <hi>Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Claudius.</note> in his Stiliconyan comends, who there makes a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription by a Serpent, that compaſſeth round with her bodie the denne or caue wherein ſhe lyeth, in ſuch ſort, that making as it were a circle, ſhe holdeth in her mouth the end of her taile: by which is ſignified the effect of time, which in it ſelfe alwaies goeth round: which deſcription is taken from the Aegyptians, who before that the vſe of letters and of writing was inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ſignified the circumference of a yeare by a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, with her taile betweene her teeth: For that in times there is the like coherence and depencie, for the end of one yeare or time paſſed, is the beginning of the other ſucceeding. And I remember the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Eternitie to be by ſome thus defigured: A wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man clothed in rich robes downe to her feet, holding in her right hand a round ball, and vpon her head is inſtrophiated a thinne vaile, which ſpreads and caſts it ſelfe downe ſo farre, as both her ſhoulders are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with wholly circumcinct and couered. The Image weighed in the heedfull ballance of aduiſe, is not much vnlike that reported by <hi>Claudianus,</hi> which wee will endeauour (though not in his right colours) thus to compoſe.</p>

The aged man, which there ſits deuiding and parting the ſtarres, may be called God, not that hee is old, for time ouer him loſeth her vertue, and worketh no effect; who of himſelfe is perpetuall and euer-li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing: but that the auncients heretofore haue pleaſed ſo defigure him, and becauſe he effecteth all things by infinite wiſdome, ruling and commanding all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures whatſoeuer, by his vnſpeakeable power, they therefore attribute vnto him old age, wherein is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly found more wiſdome, grauitie, and experience than in youth.

               <p>SAturne being expulſed heauen by Iupiter (as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories record) and throwne downe from thence into this middle region: after many daies ſailing vpon the ſea, at the length hee ariued in Italie, where hee li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued manie yeares with Ianus, then king of that part of the Countrey where Rome afterwards was built: but poorely and meanely he liued, as indeed all the people in thoſe times did, as hauing vnfound out the vſe of tilling and planting, whereby corne and other
<pb facs="tcp:8331:13"/>
fruits of the earth might ſuppeditate their wants of neceſſarie food and victuall. The vſe of which things they now learned from Saturne, who painfully inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them in the perfect knowledge of the nature of each ſoile, and how, and by what induſtrious meanes of art any ground (fruitleſſe of it ſelf by nature) might become fertile and rich. This learned and powerfull skill of Saturne, Ianus infinitely admired, inſomuch, as (manifeſting his gratefulneſſe, for ſo be hoofefull and commodious a good turne receaued) he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated part of his kingdome for him to liue vpon: affording him many other princely and reſpectiue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards. And further commanded his people, that when he died, they ſhould with all reuerence honour him as a god, a thing eaſily embraced by the ignorant Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then in thoſe daies, who in that they had receiued ſo vnexpected a benefite from his meanes, willinglie condiſcended to aſcribe and attribute vnto him all godlike reuerence, and deuout adoration, as men in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed vnto whome the ſole and eternall God had not miniſtred the Key of vnderſtanding, that their cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhut hearts liuing in the darke caue of ignorance, might therewith bee opened and vnlocked for the admittance of the true acknowledgment of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred deitie: but they onely worſhipped him for their god, who by his humane knowledge had found out ſome new means either for the earths better increaſe, or other like profit that were moſt auaileable for their labour-leſſe and ſluggiſh liuing. And therefore they willingly adored Saturne as a mightie and puiſſant god, dedicating vnto him manie ſumptuous Statues
<pb facs="tcp:8331:13"/>
and temples. And him in his Statue they framed with a hooke or ſyth in his hand, demonſtrating thereby (as they meant it) the inuention of tilling of the ground, becauſe with that the corne once recouering his maturitie, is cut downe. Other writers there are, that would haue him ſignifie Tyme, as that with his ſythe he ſhould meaſure and proportioniſe the length of Time, and therewith to decurtate and cut away all things contained therein. Thoſe alſo would haue him to be in the ſhape of a very aged man, as one who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan from beginning of the world, holding in his hand a child, which by peecemeales, hee ſeemes gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to deuour, importing the reuenge hee tooke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing baniſhed heauen by his owne children: thoſe which eſcapt the furious gulfe of his maw, were one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foure, Iupiter, Iuno, Pluto, and Neptune, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the foure elements, Fire, Aire, earth, and Water, which are not periſhable by the all-cutting ſickle of deuouring time. <hi>Martianus Capella</hi> depictures him, holding in his right hand a Serpent, with the end of <note place="margin">Martianus Capella.</note> her taile in her mouth, ſtill turning round with a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uie and dead ſlow pace, and he hath his temples rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myted with a greene wreath, which ſeemeth ſtill to flouriſh, his haire of his head, and his beard all milke white, looking like one of many yeares, withering and declining, and yet manifeſting that it is in his power to rebecome youthfull, freſh, and blooming. The wreath on his head imports the beginning or ſpring of the yeare, his haire and beard the ſnowie approch of churliſh Winter, the ſlowneſſe of the ſerpents pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces the ſluggiſh reuolution of that planet, which as
<pb facs="tcp:8331:14"/>
it is of all the greateſt, ſo it asketh longeſt time for his circular circumference, and in that from this plannet proceed dolorous and diſmall effects, they ſhape him to be old, louring, ſorrowing, hardfauonred and ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh, his nature being cold, drie, and melancholie. The ſame <hi>Martianus</hi> ſayth, That the nuptials of Mercurie <note place="margin">Martianus</note> and Philologia, when ſhe had ſearched and perviewed each corner of the higher and lower heauens, ſhee found Saturne ſitting with great ſolitude in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream cold manſion all frozen &amp; couered with yſe and ſnow, wearing on his head a helmet, on which was liuely depictured three heads, the one of a Serpent, the other of a Lyon, and the third of a Boare: which three by many conſtructions may ſignifie the effect of Time, but in that it is by the Authors themſelues, but ſleightly approued, we will wade no further in it. And yet <hi>Macrobius</hi> toucheth it very neerely, when hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes <note place="margin">Macrobius.</note> him with a Lyons head, a Dogs head, and a Wolfes head: intending by the Lyons head the time preſent, which duly placed betweene that paſt and that to come, preuaileth moſt, and is of greateſt force; or diſcouering thereby the ſtormie troubles of mans life, by the rough, vnpleaſing, and grim aſpect of the Lyon: by that of the Dog, is meant the preſent time, who alwaies fawnes on vs, and by whoſe alluring de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights we are drawne vnto vaine and vncertain hopes: The Wolues head ſignifies the time paſt, by his gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die deuouring what ere he finds, leauing no memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie behind of what hee catcheth within his clawes. Aſtarte the daughter of Celum, and wife and ſiſter of Saturne, made for her husband a princely helmet,
<pb facs="tcp:8331:14"/>
which had foure eies, two before, and two behind, which continually ſhut themſelues, &amp; ſlept by turns, ſo that two alwaies were open, and vpon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were likewiſe made foure wings, two of them volant, and two couchant, which ſignified, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he ſlept, he alwaies waked, and flying, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued fixe and permanent; vnclouding hereby the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Time: theſe heads were cut out with exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſubtletie, and rare politure: <hi>Euſebius</hi> further ſaith, <note place="margin">Euſebius.</note> That the ſame Aſtarte placed alſo vpon the head of Saturne two wings, demonſtrating thereby by one of them the excellencie and perfection of the mind, and by the other he meant mans ſence and vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. For ſay the Naturaliſts, the ſoule of man when ſhe entreth into the humane bodie, bringeth with her from the ſpheare of Saturne the force of knowledge and diſcourſe, ſo that the Platonickes vnderſtand by Saturne, the mind, and the inward contemplation of things celeſtiall, and therefore called the time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in hee liued the golden age, as a time, entertaining quiet, concord, and true content.

               <p>IT lieth farre from my intendement in this treatiſe to touch in any ſort the life of the gods of the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, or to tell now how Ianus was one of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſt kings of Italie, and how hee receiued Saturne then an exile, and participated part of his kingdome vnto him in lewe of thoſe his knowledges diſcouered: for ſo much as my purpoſe onely extendeth to tell of the Images and Statues which in thoſe times of blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and ſuperſtition were erected and conſecrated vuto their gods. According therefore to <hi>Macrobius,</hi> Ianus was the firſt that in all Italie cauſed ſacred tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <note place="margin">Macrobius.</note> and ſanctuaries of deuotion to bee built, ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſacrifices and ſuch like rites of expiation to bee vſed with all reuerence and zealous ſolemnization. By reaſon whereof hee himſelfe was afterwards among thoſe ignorant Plebeians, held and cannonized as a god. And becauſe I ſay that hee was the firſt inuenter and ſetter vp of ſuch ſacrifices, the auncients would neuer offer vp any of their oblations vnto their gods, vnleſſe they had firſt inuocated the helping aſſiſtance of Ianus. And this reaſon alſo induced them the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thereunto, for that hee was afterwards ſuppoſed to be the god which continually ſat at the dore or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall of heauen: ſo that the petitions and praiers of men below, could not paſſe or aſcend vnto the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their gods, vnleſſe he had firſt granted and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſuch their acceſſe and admittance. The gates or dores of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s are ſaid to be two, the one pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb facs="tcp:8331:15"/>
at the Eaſt, the other at the Weſt; through the firſt the ſun entreth, when he commeth to illuminat with his brightneſſe the worlds obſcutitie; and through the other hee goeth out when hee deſcendeth to the Antipodes. Thoſe therefore that by the ſunne vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Ianus (as <hi>Macrobius</hi> and others) attribute vnto him the charge or keeping of thoſe gates, in that he is alwaies freely licenſed to enter in and go out through them at his pleaſure, and for this cauſe they ſhape him forth with two faces, for that the ſun alwaies loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth round about him, both before and behind in ech part and corner of the world: and in one of his hands they put a long rod or wand, and in the other a key; ſhewing by the one the rule and gouernement hee commandeth ouer all the world: and by the other hee openeth and vnlocketh it as it were from the cloſe priſon of vapourous cloudineſſe, when hee diſcouers the orientall reſplendencie of his radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and how he ſhutteth it vp againe when he lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth it to the gloomy gouernment of the night. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is this to be vnderſtood by the day and the night only, but by all the yeare alſo, as when the ſun vnlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the ſpring from the ſtubborne embracements of the Winter, enamelling the pleaſant verdure of the earth with ſo many delicate and diuers-coloured flowers, where is found all choice of pleaſing preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in that gorgeous faire of bounteous Nature: which at his due time ended, the ſun locketh vp ſuch the ſumptuouſnes therof, ſuffering the earth to lie na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to the mercileſſe tiranny ofyce and ſnow, whoſe all-periſhing coldneſſe benums her vſeleſſe and ſtiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waxing

ioints, which lately ſo empreſſe-like floriſhed, and was ſo gloriouſly inueſted. The 2 faces of Ianus ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie alſo Time, the one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> being withered &amp; hoary, intendeth the time paſt, the other youthful &amp; beardles, meaneth the times after co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming and ſucceeding. <hi>Plinie</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Plinie.</note> writeth, That <hi>Numa</hi> king of the Romanes cauſed the Statue of Ianus to be hewen out in ſuch ſort, that the fingers of his hands appeared to be three hundred threeſcore and fiue, to demonſtrate thereby that hee was God of the yeare, and had the ſole rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement thereof. Wherevpon they called the firſt moneth of the yeare Ianuarius, of Ianus, there then king. The Phenicians, as <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> and <hi>Macrobius</hi> report, vnderſtood by Ianus, the world: <note place="margin">Marcus Tul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, and Marcobius.</note> and therefore framed his Image in the forme of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, holding her taile in her mouth, continually turning round and circumfered: as that the world doth nouriſh and feed it ſelfe, and the times thereof depending and cohering one of another. But retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the two faces of Ianus, ſome will haue ſuch depicturance to ſignifie the wiſdome and graue intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of prudent Princes, which beſides that by their wiſe counſels they doe act things politikely and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creetly, inſtantly, and for the time preſent, carrie like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in themſelues a fore-prouiding preſcience to preuent, and therby to remedie ſucceeding miſcheefs and enſuing daungers: for that with the one face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and the other behind, they continually behold and view round about them, recording things paſt, and premeditating thoſe likely to follow: the which things the ancients prefigure vnto vs by the Statue of</p>

intending (as <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſayth) That Princes and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernors <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> ought to bee the true patternes and mirrours of gods among men. And as the Romanes worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Anteuorta, and Poſtuorta as companions and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes with their gods; the one pre-knowing what wil come, the other remembring things paſt, as that from the diuine powers, nothing liue obſcured or vnreuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: ſo in the Image of Ianus, with two faces, is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the wiſdome and knowledge of kings and ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, which ought not to bee ignorant in any thing whatſoeuer, which may tend to the quiet religious and ciuile gouernement of their people and country. There haue ben alſo who haue depictured Ianus with foure faces, as there were Statues of the ſame found in diuerſe places of Tuſcane: and vndoubtedly they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted thereby the foure ſeaſons of the yeare, being all of diuerſe natures and effects, but becauſe the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Spring, the Summer, Autumne, and Winter are with euerie one very familiar, I will ceaſe to proceed therein, commemorating that onely of <hi>Ouid,</hi> when he ſpeaketh of the regall ſeat of Phoebus:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Before diuine Apolloes regall ſeat,</l>
                  <l>The beauteous ſpring ſits crown'd with curious flowers,</l>
                  <l>Next whom (with eares of corne about her head)</l>
                  <l>The ſummer ſits in her all-parching heat,</l>
                  <l>And Autumne (dy' de with iuice of grapes) downepoures</l>
                  <l>A world of new-made wine of pureſt red,</l>
                  <l>Next whom (as placed all in due arow)</l>
                  <l>Sits grim-fac'd winter couerd all with ſnow.</l>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8331:17"/>
Theſe Stations are many times thus intellected: by the Spring is meant Venus: the Summer ſignifies Ceres: Autumne challengeth Bacchus: and for the Winter, wee oftentimes vnderſtand Vulcan: &amp; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the winds with Eolus their commaunder: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe from theſe proceed thoſe tempeſtuous ſtormes, which are commonly predominant in that ſeaſon. Vnder the feet of lanus is oftentimes placed twelue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, meaning thereby the moneths of the yeare, or ſignes of the Zodiake, which the ſunne yearely in his expedition doth circulate. There was found in Rome a Statue dedicated vnto Ianus, which had as it might ſeeme, foure dores, and vnderneath foure columnes, which vnderpropped and ſupported the weightie heauineſſe of the Image, in euery one of which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes were ſet foure ſeuerall ſhels of fiſh, wherein were interſected the twelue months with greateſt cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſſe of art delimated and filed. And let this ſuffice for the Statues of Ianus, progreſſing to the Images and Pictures dedicated to the Sunne: for that he ſeemes to be the graund patrone of all Times, and that all things whatſoeuer haue their being and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe through his vertues and motions.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:8331:17"/>
who with their pleaſing deliuerie of things, ſuppoſed to bee reuealed vnto them, brought and ſeduced the people into ſuch a ſetled beleefe of thoſe their abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities, as long after it continued, ere they could free their intangled conceits from ſuch their bewitching enſnarements: for they onely ſeeking from what ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall cauſe the birth and encreaſe of things vpon the earth might ariſe (wholly ignorant of the true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuement thereof, as men guided only by others opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and common natures reaſons, and therfore not able to aduance their cogitations to the imbracement of the true cauſe indeed, being the inuiſible and euer-liuing God) ſome of them iudged the elements to be the cheefe and efficient workers of what the earth yeelded forth and produced. Neither did all of them attribute this vnto al the elements together, but ſome only gaue the cauſe of ſuch increaſe to the vertues of the water, ſome to fire, ſome to the aire, and many al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to the earth. Whervpon the Poets (as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſaith) <note place="margin">Ariſtotle.</note> being the firſt that chaunted forth the powers of ſuch their gods, induced the ſillie and ſoon-perſuaded peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to thinke, that there were then in efficient power many and diuers. By reaſon whereof, and vpon ſuch ſurmiſes, they called Neptune or Oceanus, the father of the gods; and the mother of them Veſta or Ops, the wife of Saturne: whome likewiſe they entearmed, <hi>Lagrand Madre,</hi> vnderſtanding thereby the earth, in that from her as from the originall proceed al increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes whatſoeuer, and this was generally the opinion of the Arcadians. <hi>Thales Mileſius</hi> aſcribed the cauſe of <note place="margin">Thales Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſius.</note> ſuch generation of things vnto the vertues of the

And yet generally with the Aſſyrians this perſuaſion preuailed not: For (ſay they) we may well erect Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and Images to many other gods, but vnto thoſe whoſe true ſhapes wee may continually behold with our eies, it ſhall bee very purpoſeleſſe: yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding (ſaith <hi>Macrobius)</hi> becauſe ſome in thoſe daies affirme the ſonne and Iupiter to be all one, in one part <note place="margin">Macrobius.</note> of Aſſyria there was found a Statue made and erected of the Sonne, all gloriouſly beautified and poliſhed with gold, in the forme of a young man without a beard, who ſtretching out his armes, held in the right hand a coachmans whip, and in the left a thunderbolt with certaine eares of corne: ſhewing therby the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers, both of Sol and Iupiter. And becauſe that of all the celeſtiall bodies hee carrieth greateſt force in the creation of terrene things, the ancients through him vnderſtand many times many of their gods, as his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, natures, and effects are many. Wherupon it grew that they framed him in ſo diuers and ſeuerall ſhapes. But leauing ſuch their opinions to themſelues, wee will now ſpeake of him as he is Apollo, Sol, and Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, which three I doe make all one, him therefore the auncients (as I haue already ſaid) ſhaped with a very youthfull countenance, beardleſſe, and young-yeard.

Many that haue depictuted the ſhape of Apollo, make him holding in his hand a Harpe with ſeuen ſtrings, agreeing in number with the planets of the heauens, which mouing with a due deſtinction, yeeld forth a pleaſing harmonie. <hi>Macrobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>

the planets, commanding them to haſten or enſlacke their reuolutions, in manner as in efficient vigor and ſtrength they receiue from him their vertues and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations. And for this cauſe likewiſe the auncients called him the head or guide of the Muſes, which like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe were framed like vnto young virgines of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and youthfull aſpect, habited as wandering and ſiluane Nimphs, with diuerſe-ſhaped inſtruments in their hands, melodiouſly and with a ſoule-rauiſhing touch continually playing: and from theſe all the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berall ſciences acknowledge their being, whereupon they were entearmed the daughters of Iupiter and Memoria, as inſtantly becomming skilfull and perfect in what they vndertake to learne. They were impalled with coronets, compoſed of ſundry-ſhaped flowers and leaues, to which were annexed beauteous gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands of palme: and oftentimes alſo they had their temples curiouſly adorned with feathers of diuerſe and ſtrange colours, by which is intended their victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious preuailement ouer the Piërides, contending for the pleaſantneſſe of their voice to compare with them in ſinging, which being afterwards foiled and diſgraced in ſuch their ſuper-arrogating challenges, were for their ſancineſſe therein, metamorphiſed into tatling birds, which with vs wee call Pies, readie and prompt to bring forth many familiar languages by vſe and teaching. Some thinke alſo, that ſuch their coronets of flowers and palme, ſignified the triumph which they carried away from the Syrens, preſuming likewiſe to compare with them for the cleereſt and moſt delightfull voices. And in Rome of latter times

was ſeene a Statute dedicated vnto the Muſes, which on the head and culme of the picture had many and diuers-faſhion'd feathers infixed; and they were thought to bee thoſe of the Syrens. The auncients when they intended to ſet down how the liberall arts, and all other ſciences, depended one vpon the other, and were as it were knit and coheared together, depi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured the Muſes, holding one another by the hand, and heedfully dauncing (as it were in a round) lead and guided by Apollo: which meaneth that ſuperiour light and vnderſtanding, which illuminateth and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth the intellectuall parts of men. The hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens (according to the opinion of the Platonickes) haue euery one their ſeuerall Muſe, called by them of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes Syrens, as moſt harmoniouſly and ſweetly ſinging, alluded vnto the celeſtiall orbes, which in number are likewiſe nine, and haue their motions ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they receiue their ſeuerall powers from the ſon, which commandeth abſolutely both aboue him, here with vs, and in the lower center: by reaſon whereof he is called <hi>Dio del Cielo, della Terra, e dell' In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferno:</hi> and the auncients attribute vnto him powerful commands ouer all the three. The Harpe which (as I haue ſaid before) he holdeth in his hand, denotateth the celeſtiall and incomparable muſicke of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly orbes: his ſhield or target by his ſide, repreſents the circular compoſition and rotunditie of our he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myſphere; for the ancients defigure him with a ſhield on his arme, and ſome alſo giue him a quiuer of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes on the other ſide, which may ſignifie, that as they once loſed from the bow, penetrate and enter
<pb facs="tcp:8331:20"/>
in with great force where they hit, ſo the forcible ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of the Sunnes tranſparent raies, ſearch out and pierce through the ſmalleſt craſe or voidance on the earth. Others that ſay Apollo is called <hi>Dio dell' Inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no,</hi> and giue thoſe arrowes ſo appropriated vnto him, doe meane, that from the ouer-vehement ardour and riſcaldation of his beames, peſtilences and infections are engendred and nouriſhed on the earth: but yet ſay they, not ſo vniuerſally diſperſed, or vndoubtedly mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, but with the moderate warmth and temperature thereof, they are chaſed away, and healthie aires and naturall increaſes ſpring vp and re-ſucceed. Among other things appropriated vnto the Sun, the ancients dedicated vnto him a Wolfe, and their reaſon was this: That as the powerfull vertue of the Sunne ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth vp and drieth the watriſh exhalations of the earth: ſo the voracious greedineſſe of the Wolfe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patcheth and conſumeth that prey which in his famin meeteth him by chance. Afterwards it grew that ſome were of opinion, that the Sunne, the Moone, and the Stars, fed themſelues and were maintained and nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with the moiſtures and humidities, aſcending from the earth. And this <hi>Homer</hi> ſeemeth to affirme, <note place="margin">Homer.</note> when he ſayth, That Iupiter with other gods (mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Sun and certaine Starres) deſcended downe to Oceanus to a banquet. It is reported, that the Wolf is of ſo ſharpe and cleere ſight, that hee ſees very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly in the thickeſt night, piercing through the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porous miſtineſſe of the ſame, as the Sunne vpon his firſt apparence and ſecond howers circuit, rarifies the condenſate aire, baniſhing the obfuſtate and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated
<pb facs="tcp:8331:20"/>
cloudineſſe thereof. In Delphos in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Apollo, there was found the picture of a Wolf of ſtone and other hard mettals, exquiſitely well cut out and hewen, and the liuely parts thereof were with ſuch great cunning and curiouſneſſe of art intrauer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as it poſſeſſed the beholders eies with an earneſt and continuous admiration. And this picture there was held with ſuch great veneration, for that <hi>Latona</hi> begot with child by Iupiter, and transformed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to a Wolfe (as fearing to bee detected by Iuno) brought forth being ſo metamorphiſed, and in that ſtrange ſhape, Apollo: or that as ſome others thinke, that picture was regarded there with ſuch zealous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruance, for that it was ſuppoſed to be a Wolf which diſcouered the ſacriledge and robbing of certaine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared reliques from that temple: howſoeuer, my opinion is, that the auncients vſed to appropriate the names of ſuch beaſts to their gods, as they perceiued to be in them any aſſimilitude or correſpondencie of natures and effects. <hi>Martianus</hi> therefore ſayth, That <note place="margin">Martianus.</note> vnto Apollo was conſecrated the Crow, in token of his foretelling and propheticall diuination: and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Swan, manifeſting thereby by the contrarie colours of theſe two birds, that the perſpicuous and corruſcant tralucencie of the ſun, maketh the aſpect of the day in cleereneſſe and brightneſſe like to the feathers of the Swan, and after his departure from vs, abſenting his irradiance from the worlds illuſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he cauſeth the night to look of that pitchie and gloomie countenance, reſembling in darkeneſſe and ietty hue thoſe feathers of the Crow. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <note place="margin">Pauſanias.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8331:21"/>
That in many places of Greece they reuerenced with great deuotion a Cocke, as the bird of Apollo, becauſe in his morning notes hee pre-warneth vs of the appropinquation of the Suns returne. <hi>Homer</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <note place="margin">Homer.</note> mention, That the Sparrow-hawke (as wee now call them) was conſecrated to Apollo, and hee calleth hir his ſwift-poſting meſſenger. And in the ſame place hee writeth, That <hi>Telemachus</hi> returning home into Ithaca, beheld a Sparrow-hawke in the aire eagerly purſuing and chaſing a Doue, which he tooke as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall diuination of ſucceeding good hap, and that hee ſhould now free and emptie his houſe of thoſe ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>earneſt and importunate ſuters which daily remained there for the loue of his mother. <hi>Euſebius</hi> reporteth, <note place="margin">Euſebius.</note> That in Aegypt the Image of Sol was ſo framed, that it ſeemed to be ſet in a ſhip, carried vp, and ſupported by a Crocadile: meaning to ſignifie by the ſhip, that quicke motion and liuely ſtirring, which in each moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture and humiditie worketh for the generation of what it containeth: &amp; by the Crocadile is vnderſtood that wholeſome and ſweet water from which the Sun by vertue of his temperate raies exhaleth away all corruptible and infecting humors. And further, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Sparrow-hawke this may bee ſpoken: It is found written by <hi>Diodorus Sycula,</hi> entreating of theſe <note place="margin">Diodorus Sycula.</note> beaſts and birds, which in the daies of the auncients were worſhipped and regarded as gods, that in thoſe times a Sparrowhawke was ſeene in Thebes, a Cittie of Aegypt, carrying in her mouth a booke written with red letters, which ſhee deliuered to the Prieſts and Churchmen there, containing in it in breefe, with
<pb facs="tcp:8331:21"/>
what zeale and vnfained veneration the gods ought to be worſhipped and adored, and how neerely now it concerned them to proceed with a heedfull and due effectuating what was there propoſed: Wherevpon afterwards it grew, that their writers of ſacred and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bookes did weare alwaies on their head a red cap, with a wing of the ſame bird infixed thereunto. The auncients heretofore did not only vnſhadow the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of their gods, by beaſts and liuing creatures, but many times alſo by plants, flowers, &amp; trees, which they conſecrated of purpoſe, &amp; dedicated vnto them: wherevpon the lawrell or Bay was then appropriated vnto Apollo, and therewith were made wreaths and garlands, with which his temples were girt and rede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myted in token (as ſome think) of the ardent loue and affection which he caried to Daphne the daughter of Peneus, transformed into that tree by Neptune. The Aegyptians, before the vſe of letters and writing was found out, framed the ſhape of the ſun by compoſing a ſcepter, in the vpper top whereof they inſected an eye, very curiouſly and with great induſtry of art en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen: and they called it The eye of Iupiter, as that he beheld and ouer-viewed the large ſcope and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſe of the world, ruling it with great wiſedome and due execution of rightfull iuſtice, ſo intended by the ſcepter, ſignifying command and gouernement. The Lacedemonians cauſed the Statue of Apollo to bee cut out with foure eares, and with as many hands, the reaſon that they ſo ſhaped him as many thinke, was for that hee was ſeene to fight for them in that forme and proportion: but others take it to diſcouer &amp; ſhew
<pb facs="tcp:8331:22"/>
vnto vs the iudgement and prudencie of that god, as being ſlow to ſpeake, and readie to heare, and thervp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it grew as a Proue be among the Grecians, Heare him (ſay they) that hath foure eares: meaning thereby the ſound knowledge and vnderſtanding of him that heareth much and ſpeaketh little. <hi>Apulcius</hi> affirming, <note place="margin">Apulcius.</note> That the ſunne with his deepe-ſearching raies behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth any thing whatſoeuer, ſayth, That in Theſſalie were certaine witches, which when they had with their enchauntments and ſorceriſmes either bewit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched any man, or theeuiſhly ſtolne any thing away, would preſently flie, and conuey themſelues into transfaced and vpreared caues, and many times into graues where dead carkaſſes lay interred, ſeeking by ſuch meanes to ſhrowd themſelues from the view and ſight of the ſun, thinking it almoſt impoſſible to keep any thing hid from the farre-reaching and ſin-diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uering eie thereof. The Phenicians had the Statue of the ſun framed of blacke ſtone, large and ſpacious at the bottome, but very ſharpe and narrow at the top, the which <hi>Herodotus</hi> reporteth, they boaſted to haue <note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> receiued from heauen, and they ſolemnely affirmed that to be the true Image or Idea of the ſun, not made by any cunning of art, but ſo defigured by the diuine powers. <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſayth, That in Perſia the ſunne was <note place="margin">Lactantius.</note> the principall and cheefeſt God they there adored, and him they worſhipped in a caue or denne, and his Statue was framed in this manner: Hee had the head of a Lyon, and was habited according to the Perſian cuſtome, wearing on his head ſuch tires &amp; ornaments as the women of Perſia vſed to bee intreſted with, and
<pb facs="tcp:8331:22"/>
he ſeemed to hold by main force, a white cow by the hornes. The head of the Lion meaneth, that the ſun hath greater vertue and domination in that ſign then in any other of all the Zodiake: or that he is of power and commaund among the planets ſo mightie as the Lyon is among beaſts: the caue or den intendeth his eclipſe: the cow may ſeeme to ſignifie the moone, for thoſe reaſons which hereafter in her deſcription ſhall be diſcouered. The ſun ſeeming to inforce and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine her, meaneth, that hee very oftentimes darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth her light, and cleane taketh away her brightnes, in that Nature (by her propoſed lawes) commands her to obey and follow him. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> writeth, That <note place="margin">Pauſania.</note> in Patra, a citie of Achaia, was found a Statue dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Apollo. made of ſtrange ſtones and other very hard mettals, and it ſeemed to haue the frame &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of an Oxe or Cow, which beaſts as they ſaid, were gratefull to Apollo: and <hi>Homer</hi> ſpeaking how A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo <note place="margin">Homer.</note> was hired to keepe the heard of cattell for Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medon, thus ſaith, when hee reported the ſpeech of Neptune:</p>

               <p>Which ſhewes, that beſides the many names
<pb facs="tcp:8331:23"/>
aſcribed to Apollo, hee was likewiſe ſometimes called a ſheepeheard, from which it may be intended, that as from the temperat heat and vertue of the ſun al things here are nouriſhed and increaſed, ſo by the diligent care of the ſheepeheard, his flocke receiueth healthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, ſoundneſſe, and increaſe. <hi>Lucianus</hi> ſayth, That <note place="margin">Lucianus.</note> the Aſſyrians only defigured Apollo with a beard, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending all others for ſhaping him otherwiſe, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſuch youthfulneſſe and greeneneſſe of years, diſcouered a certaine want and imperfection, which (ſay they) ought not to bee allowed in framing the Statues of their gods, and therefore they ſhaped him with a reaſonable long beard, as one attained to his true and perfect virility: and vpon his breaſt they pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced a ſhield, holding in his right hand a ſpeare, on the top whereof was ſet forth a figurelet of Victoria: in his left hand hee ſeemed to hold a very rare flower: downe from his ſhoulders depended a veſtement, wherein was curiouſly proportioned the head of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſa, from which dangled and pointed downewards infinite ſwarmes of Snakes: on the one ſide of him were placed certaine Eagles volant: before his feet ſtood the liuely picture of a Nimph, which on either ſide of her likewiſe had two other Nimphs placed, whoſe bodies a Serpent with her flexible and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnings ſeemed to annodate and conioine. This cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious-compoſed Statue flowed with ſtrange varieties of eie-delighting and illuſtrious decoraments, that vndoubtedly the beholders eares asked as great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to vnderſtand the meaning, as their eyes cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued time to behold the matter. And for that <hi>Macrobius</hi>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8331:23"/>
ſets it ſo forth, wee will heare what expoſitiue inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation he can deliuer it. His beard which from his chin hangeth downe very long, ſharpening it ſelfe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the end, reſembles (ſayth hee) the raies of the ſun, which from the heauens reach downe vnto the earth. The ſhield and ſpear intend the nature of Mars, for that with ſome they are held to be all one. The fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of Victoria, ſheweth vs, that all things whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, are ſubiect vnto the ſun, and haue their beginning and being from the vertues thereof. The flower ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the beauties and excellencies of thoſe things, which the ſecret powers of the ſun with the life-gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing warmeneſſe of the ſame engendreth, nouriſheth and maintaineth. The Nimph which ſtands before his feet, repreſenteth the earth, the which the ſun from aboue, comforteth with his moderat heat: The which alſo the Aſſyrians themſelues did ſeeme to confirme (as ſaith <hi>Macrobius)</hi> by the Image of their god, which <note place="margin">Macrobius:</note> they called Adad, vnto whom they made ſubiect and obedient the goddeſſe Adargate, and vnto theſe two they beleeued all things to bee tied in ſubiection; and by the one they vnderſtood the ſun, and by the other the earth. The other two Nimphs which ſtand on both ſides of him, ſignifie the mould or ſubſtance whereof things are made, and Nature which ſhapes them into proportion. The Serpent with her often twining of her bodie, denotateth the many crooked windings and turnings which the ſun with his raies incircleth. The Eagles in that by nature they are ſwift of wing, and couet alwaies to flie very high, are allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnto the wonderful velocitie, and exceeding alti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
<pb facs="tcp:8331:24"/>
of the ſun: or as the Eagle commaundeth aboue all other birds, ſo the ſunne hath his abſolute domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ouer the Planets. The habite which hee wore on his ſhoulders with the head of Meduſa, ſignifies Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerua, which is nothing elſe (as <hi>Porphirius</hi> ſayth) but <note place="margin">Porphirius.</note> that pure vertue of the ſun, which cleareth and refi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth human intellect, and infuſeth ingenious conceits into the braines of men. The Aegyptians compoſed many Statues of the ſun, and among the reſt one was in the ſhape of a man, with the head of it (as it might ſeeme) halfe ſhauen, and the haire taken away, ſo that on the right ſide only remained haires, which (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Macrobius)</hi> meaneth, that the ſun is neuer ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent <note place="margin">Macrobius.</note> from Nature, but ſhe continually feeleth the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and operations of his raies. And that that part of the head that is ſhauen, ſignifies, that though the ſun for ſome time detaine his glorious aſpect from the world, yet that he is to return and re-beautifie the ſame with as great brightneſſe as at the firſt, as thoſe haires ſo ſhauen wil againe ſpring forth &amp; re-increaſe to their true and full perfections. And in ſome parts of Aegypt they infixed on the Statue of the ſun two feathers, the one of them blacke and of a duskie hue, the other bright and ſhining: and the blacke they ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <hi>Penna infernale,</hi> and the other <hi>Penna celeſte,</hi> for that the ſunne keepeth his abiding in the heauens all thoſe times when he paſſeth through thoſe ſixe ſigns of the Zodiake, whoſe vertues make the ſtation of the parching ſummer, being called <hi>Segni ſuperiori,</hi> and they report him to deſcend down into the lower cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the earth (called Tartarius) when he beginneth
<pb facs="tcp:8331:24"/>
to take his circuit through the other ſixe ſignes, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tearmed <hi>Segni inferiori.</hi> And for that they placed thoſe feathers ſo vpon him, it ſignified (as <hi>Macrobius</hi> likewiſe ſayth) his ſwiftneſſe and faſt-flying circumference. It is read, that in one part of Aegypt they vnderſtood the ſun by the name of Serapides (which name likewiſe is oftentimes taken for Iupiter) and him they ſhaped in forme of a man, holding in his left hand a buſhell, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending thereby that there ought to be a proportion and due meaſure among men, obſerued with an equal and iuſt diſtribution of all things neceſſarie. And this their god which they then tearmed Serapides, had a Statue in the temple of Alexandria a cittie in Aegypt dedicated vnto him, compacted almoſt of all ſorts of ſtrangeſt and vnknowne mettals, and it was framed of ſo exceeding huge and immeaſurable extenſion, that his armes (being ſtretched forth) reached to both ſides of the temple, at the one ſide of which was made with ſubtle curiouſneſſe of art a windolet or ſmalleſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectiue hole, into which the all-ſearching radiance of the ſun vpon his firſt apparance (hauing vnbolted the purple colour'd dores of the Eaſt) would pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate and enter, gliſtering and ſhining with a maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous reflection on the well-hewen and finely-poliſh'd face of that Coloſſe, in ſuch a ſort, that the fooliſh and faith-wanting vulgars in thoſe times, credibly belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that the ſun came euery morning of dutie to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Serapides, and to kiſſe his cheekes. This picture was there adored with all reuerence and humble ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, being made with ſuch incredible art &amp; work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, that the ſtones and other hardeſt mettals
<pb facs="tcp:8331:25"/>
thereof were ſo collaterally couched, and with ſuch priuie conclanſture, as it they had ben waxe, or fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of other like flexible ſubſtance, being ſo exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitely well diſpoſed, and with ſuch commodulat order of diſcreet correſpondencie. <hi>Martianus Capella</hi> ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the marrying of Mercurie, ſayth, That Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie <note place="margin">Martianus Capella.</note> and Vertue looking for Phebus for his aduiſe in ſome matters, found him ſitting gloriouſly in a regall and tribunall ſeat, hauing before his feet foure veſſels of ſeuerall mettals, whoſe lids were cloſely ſhut and couered, and theſe were made of diuers formes and ſubſtances, the firſt was framed of the moſt hard and durable yron, from which there ſeemed to euacuate freſh-burning and liuely fires, and it was called, <hi>Capo di Vulcano:</hi> The next was of cleereſt and brighteſt ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, filled with the puritie of well-tempred aire, and this was called <hi>Riſo di Gioue:</hi> the third was compacted of ſolide and peizie lead, implete with raine, haile, froſt, and ſnow, called <hi>Morte di Saturno:</hi> the laſt which ſtood neere to Phebus, was framed of the fineſt and tranſparent glaſſe, containing in it the inuiſible ſeed which the vpper elements ſprinckle on the earth, and it had to name <hi>Poppa di Giunone.</hi> Out of theſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, ſometimes from the one, and ſometimes from the other, would he call out ſuch working vertues, as ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by men here below receiued their health and life, or their diſeaſes and death: ſo that when hee intended to ſend vnto the world a healthie temperature, and life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſeruing aire, he would commixe ſome of that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſiluer veſſell, with that incloſed in the veſſel of glaſſe: and when hee meant to plague the
<pb facs="tcp:8331:25"/>
world with peſtilences, infections, and mortalities, he conioined the burning and ardorous flames of the y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron veſſell, with that inteined in the other of Lead. Wherby it may directly appeare, that the diuerſities and contrarious effects of Times, proceed from the moderation of the ſuns forcible radiance, or from the extremitie of his fierie riſcaldation: and that as the one bringeth with it a generall healthineſſe and encreaſe, purging the aire of groſſe and plagues-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendring vapours, ſo the intemperature and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcorching furie of the ſame, poſſeſſing the earth with a vniuerſall ariditie, poyſoneth the aire with infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous humors, and diſtilleth downe on the middle regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all kinds of noiſome vnſoundneſſe and infirmities, by whoſe ill-ſmelling odors and corruptions, the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of men and all other creatures, become lame, ſick, putrified, and diſeaſefull. Among the auncients, Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culapius (as is already ſaid) was held to be the ſonne of Apollo, and hee was ſaid to bee the father of Higiea, which interpreted, ſignifies ſoundneſſe of bodie, and perfection of health. And <hi>Pauſanias</hi> taking it from the <note place="margin">Pauſanias.</note> Phenicians, ſayth, That Eſculapius is nothing elſe but the aire, which purged of ill humours by the ſun, bringeth vigour and luſtineſſe to men on the earth: whereupon alſo they called him many times god of Phiſyke. But returning to the Images of Apollo, there was found at Naples a Statue dedicated vnto him, which (beſides many other curious ornaments and beauties it was decked with) had depictured on one of the ſhoulders with greateſt skill and diſquitition of the, inuenter, a liuely and excellent-proportioned
<pb facs="tcp:8331:26"/>
Doue: and there ſtood before the Image a virgin, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellouſly well cut forth, which ſeemed with won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous earneſtneſſe to behold, and as it appeared to reuerence the bird: which virgin among the ancients was ſaid to be Parthenope, who in her trauels from Greece to Naples, was ſafely conducted by the good guidance and leading of a Doue, perceiuing by many manifeſt tokens comming from that bird, the good ſucceſſe and effect of that her iourny. <hi>Martianus</hi> (of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes buſie in the deſcriptions of Phebus) thus <note place="margin">Martianus</note> ſets himforth: Vpon his head (ſayth he) hee weares a gorgeous and royall crowne, whereon were deſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſperpled, and apactly inchaſed many moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, priceleſſe, and corruſcant gems, of ſuch conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous and bright-glittering luſtre, as dazelled any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane eyes to gaze thereon: of which, three of them beautified his all glorious and far-ſhining forehead, and theſe exceeded any of the reſt in puritie of gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and daintineſſe of colour; ſixe other adorned his temples, three on the one ſide, and three on the other, with rare perſpicuitie and incredible cleerenes, whoſe vertues at certaine times of the year with diuers and ſeuerall hues, compounding the pleaſant and perfect verdure of the ſpring with ſundry-ſorted colours of ſtraungeſt commixture, beautifies and depaints the earth. The other three which were placed in the hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermoſt part of the crowne, are of this nature, that they are firſt engendred, and receiue their true and ful perfection in the moſt cold ſnowie and yce-frozen Winters: his treſſes of haire which hang downe his ſhoulders, looke like the moſt pure and refined gold,

               <p>It is read likewiſe with <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> that in Arcadia was a Statue made of Diana, all couered ouer with the skin of a Hind, and from her ſhoulders there hung a quiuer of arrowes: in one hand ſhee held a burning lampe, and the other ſhee leaned vpon the heads of two gentle ſerpents, and before her feet there ſtood a hound, cut out and proportioned with wondrous great art and induſtrious labour of the workeman. The auncients firſt began to conſecrate Hinds vnto Diana, ſince that time that ſhee ſent ſuch infectious plagues among the Grecians, in token of her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure which ſhee conceiued againſt Agamemnon, for killing a Hind. And afterwards alſo among the Romanes they did commonly ſacrifice a Hind vnto her, adorning their holy ſanctuaries and temples with the hornes thereof. And hetherto for the deſcription
<pb facs="tcp:8331:31"/>
of the Moone as ſhe is Diana, who was oftentimes alſo among the auncients called Triuia, and depictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with three heads, which indeed rather belongeth vnto her as Hecate, and not as Diana. This Hecate the auncients worſhipped and adored, as ſhe that had the guard and keeping of all croſſe waies, and ſuch lanes as in the end concurred and conioined themſelues in one, and for that cauſe they depictured her with three heads, whereupon <hi>Ouid</hi> thus ſpeaketh:</p>

                  <l>Which alwaies after the true path ſhall keepe.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>From whence likewiſe it proceeded, that <hi>Virgil</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes cals her Trigemina, Triuia, and Triforme. And it is ſaid, that Orpheus aſcribed vnto her ſuch fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, meaning to declare thereby the diuers and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie aſpects which we oftentimes may diſcerne to be in the Moone, and that her vertues and effects are po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull and working, not onely in the heauens where ſhee is called Luna, and on the earth where ſhee is knowne by the name of Diana, but alſo extend down euen to the bowels of Erebus, where ſhee is called Hecate and Proſerpina, where it is ſuppoſed ſhee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth during the time of her lights abſence from the worlds view and illuſtrement.

called Hecate and Triforme by reaſon of the many ſhapes and figures that appeare many times to bee in her countenance, which proceedeth from the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titie of the light which ſhe receaueth from the beams of Phoebus. The auncients appropriated the Lawrell vnto her as due vnto her from her brother Apollo. And thus much as ſhee is Hecate. The Aegyptians (as I haue alreadie ſaid) worſhipped the Moone vnder the name of Iſis, and her they depictured couered with a blacke and ſable veſture, in token that of her ſelfe ſhee giueth no light. And it is written by the Poets that ſhe was the daughter of the floud Inachus, and called by the name of lo, and after that ſhe loſt her virginitie to Iupiter, ſhee trauelled into Aegypt, where among them ſhe was ſo entearmed by the name of Iſis. And they framed her Statue, holding in one hand a Cym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball, and in the other an earthen veſſell of water, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon (as <hi>Seruius</hi> ſayth) many ſuppoſed her to bee the <note place="margin">Seruius.</note> Genius of Aegypt, in that through ſuch her depictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance the nature of that country was opened and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered: vnderſtanding by the Cymball which ſhee ſo holdeth in one of her hands, that vncouth noiſe and farre-heard murmure which Nilus roareth forth, when with her tumbling and furious billowes ſhee ouer-waſheth the ſpacious fields of Aegypt: and by the other veſſell of water, the many Riuers, Pooles, and Lakes in which that Country excelleth. <hi>Apulcius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apulcius.</note> reporteth, that after his recouerie from his tranſmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation into the forme of an aſſe, bee dreamed to haue ſeene Iſis appeare one night before him in a viſion, and hee there ſo deſcribes her, as it may bee eaſily ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
<pb facs="tcp:8331:32"/>
that ſhee was the very ſame as I haue alreadie ſet downe Luna to be, and which the Aegyptians with ſo ſtraunge and new-found ceremonies ſo adored. <hi>Martianus</hi> writeth, That Philologia entring into that <note place="margin">Martianus</note> ſpheare of the Moone, ſaw there many and diuers-fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Cymbals, and likewiſe the torches of Ceres, the bow of Diana, the Timbrell of Cibele, and a kind of ſhape alſo with three hornes, which I haue already ſaid to bee in the Moon: all which things are appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated and due vnto Luna. But returning to the deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription which <hi>Apuleius</hi> ſo maketh of her in ſuch his <note place="margin">Apuleius.</note> viſion, he ſayth, That ſhee then ſeemed vnto him as it were all wet and new come out of the ſea, with her haire hanging looſe about her ſhoulders, and vpon the crowne of her head was mounted a moſt curious and delicate chaplet, compoſed of diuers ſweet-ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling and ſundry-ſorted flowers, in the midſt of her ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning forehead appeared a certaine ſquared and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangulate circle, glittering with wonderous luſtre and vnſpeakeable corruſcancie: on either ſide of her ſtood certaine young whelpes of Serpents: her apar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell ſeemed to bee of diuerſe colours of a moſt ſubtle and thin ſubſtance, ſome part of it ſhewing white, and of an aſhie hue, otherſome darkiſh and ſad, and in ſome other places of it, it appeared reddiſh and high coloured. And ouer this garment ſhe wore one other of all blacke, yet gliſtering in that kind, and of a moſt perfect iettiſh hue, which was very thicke beſpotted and adulterated with true-ſhapt ſtarres of gold and ſiluer, amidſt the which was inſerted a moſt glorious and bright-ſhining Moone, formed out with inimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb facs="tcp:8331:32"/>
art of the workeman, and round about the hem or skirt of this vn matchable veſture was interpoſed a moſt curious and delicate border of verdent foliature, intrauerſed among the liuely depicturances of all kinds and ſorts of fruits. In her right hand ſhee held a certaine inſtrument made like a Cymball, which of it ſelfe would yeeld forth a moſt ſhrill and lowd report: from her left arme hung downe a ſtraunge-faſhioned veſſell, compacted clean of gold, with the handle and foot of it proportioned into the forme of a liuely ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, which ſeemed mightily puft vp and ſwoln with poyſon: and before her feet there was placed a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ornament and skilfull deuiſe, made of the leaues of palme. And thus farre <hi>Apuleius</hi> deſcribes the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parance of Iſis. The varietie of ſuch-her colours in her apparrell, may be drawne into theſe naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons: for that the Moone doth oftentimes turne her ſelfe into diuerſe aſpects, which thereby denotate the diuerſities of the natures of ſeaſons ſucceeding, as hir rednes and high colour foretelleth the approch of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and bluſtring winds, her dark and muddy-hued looke the cluſtring together and conglomeration of watrie clouds from which iſſueth ouer abundance of raine and moiſture, and her white and cleare aſpect pretokeneth calmes and ſerenitie of weather: her vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per garment being black, ſignifieth as I haue ſaid, that ſhe hath no light of her ſelfe. Some thinke, that the Cymball which <hi>Apuleius</hi> deſcribes ſo to bee in one of her hands, diſcouered thoſe old vſances of the aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, who in thoſe times credibly ſuppoſed to haue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely pleaſed the Moone by making certain ſtrange
<pb facs="tcp:8331:33"/>
muſicall noices which they cauſed by certaine inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments then in requeſt among them: others ſay, that it intended that pleaſant ſound which the Moone in her reuolution through the vpper heauens is heard to make, which is alſo the opinio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Platonicks, who affirme, that the ſtirring of the celeſtiall orbes yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth forth a moſt harmonious and delightful muſick. <hi>Herodotus</hi> ſayth, That in thoſe ſacrifices which the <note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> Aegyptians vſed ſo to offer vp to Iſis, the women ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to play on Cymbals, and the men on tabers, honouring ſuch their feaſtiuals with infinite ſorts of rites &amp; ceremonies of ſole<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nization. The veſſell which hung downe from her left hand, ſignifies the liuely motion and ſtirring of the waters, cauſed by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue humiditie of the Moone, wherevpon it is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, that according to her fulneſſe or decreaſing of her light, the ſea receaueth that prowd and loftie car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of her billowes in her flowing, and that lowly and deiected demeanure in her ebbing: and for that the often changes and alterations of the Moone, may in ſome ſort touch the vnſtedfaſt and vncertaine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine of all things in mans life, it is not amiſſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the ſayings of <hi>Ambroſius,</hi> who many times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludeth <note place="margin">Ambroſius.</note> the goods, poſſeſſions, and pleaſures, which here men doe enioy to the inconſtant and mutable changes of the Moones aſpects, noting thereby, that there is nothing on the earth firme, permanent, or euer during, but that all the beauties and ornaments of the world are waſted and ſpoiled by the ſeuere ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of all-deuouring time: wherupon (according to the opinion of manie) the Romanes afterwards
<pb facs="tcp:8331:33"/>
(ſuch eſpecially as were nobly deſcended, and of aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient family) wore alwaies on the tops of their ſhoes certaine little Moons curiouſly depainted, inſomuch, as that they being of mightie reuenues and of power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full commands, might ſo bee remembred and put in mind of the caſualtie and doubtfull enioying of ſuch their world-bred felicities and terrene pleaſures: and that continually meditating on ſuch the inſtabillitie of fortunes gifts and fauours, they ſhould not grow inſolent, prowd, forgetfull of their being, or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>highly thoughted.

The rod or ſheepehooke in his hand, meaneth the rule and gouernment which he carrieth ouer all things. By the pipe of ſeuen reeds may be intended the muſical melodie of the heauens, cauſed (as ſome hold) by the motion of the ſunne. And ſo diuerſe men varie and differ in their deſcriptions, ſimiles, &amp; applications. <hi>Plato</hi> vnderſtandeth through <note place="margin">Plato.</note> Pan, Reaſon &amp; Knowledge; and that it is of two ſorts, the one of a man, the other of a beaſt: And for that (ſayth hee) it is many times argued and reaſoned both truly and falſely betweene two parties, hee entendeth by the vpper part of Pan the truth, accompanied with reaſon, which being of it ſelfe diuine, erecteth and lifteth vp it ſelfe alwaies towards the heauens; and that part below ſignifies the falſeneſſe of things, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing harſh, beaſtly and rude, liueth here in the world, and is onely delighted with the pleaſures and fooliſh vanities thereof. But howſoeuer this deſcription of Pan may be drawne into ſeuerall meanings, it pleaſed the auncients ſo to defigure him from the middle vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (as I haue ſaid) they framed him to the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:8331:37"/>
and ſimilitude of a man, with his face ruddie and ſanguine, being very hairie, his ſhoulders and breaſt couered with the skin of a ſpotted Doe, Panther, or Leopard. In the one hand he held a ſheepehooke, and in the other a whiſtle, much vſed of ſheepeheards, when in their pleaſant humors they carroll forth their rurall notes of mirth and iouiſance: from the middle downewards hee carried the perfect ſhape of a Goat, both thighes, legs, and feet. After the ſame forme and portraiture alſo were the Faunes, Siluans, and Satyres depictured and ſet forth, hauing little ſhort hornes growing on their heads, with ſmall eares, and ſhort tailes. And it is read that among ſome people they are held in very great regard and obſeruance, and that they are crowned by them with lillies, and other deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate flowers. They are of a moſt wonderfull ſpeed in running, and inhabite among the ſteepeſt and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt hils of India, (according to <hi>Plinie)</hi> being of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible <note place="margin">Plinie.</note> footmanſhip, that they are neuer taken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe by extremitie of old age, or other impedimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall diſeaſe or ſickeneſſe. <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth, That there <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> was one of theſe brought and preſented for a rare gift vnto <hi>Sylla,</hi> returning from the warres againſt <hi>Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates.</hi> But regreſſing to Pan, <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth, That he <note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> was one of thoſe eight cheefe and principall gods which were ſo worſhipped and adored among the Aegyptians, and among the Mendeſians held in grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt regard and reputation. And vnto him there they dedicated and conſecrated the Pine, of whoſe leaues they compoſed many curious garlands, and encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed his hornes therwith: the reaſon hereof (as ſome

                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained therein, are tied in ſubiection and dutie vnto the will of the higheſt king. In his right hand they place a mightie Eagle, ioyned with the portraiture of Victoria, meaning thereby as by the other, that as the Eagle ouer all other birds whatſoeuer ruleth as cheef,

ſo all the men in this world, and all other things inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed within her ſpacious embracements, ſtand vaſſali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed and ſubiect to the all-commanding power of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter. And this picture was erected in Piraeus, a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and magnifique gate of Athens. The Aegyptians framed vnto themſelues for the picture of Iupiter, a peece of ſquared wood, wherein was proportioned two round circles, as it were one ouer the other, through which there ſeemed to creepe a Serpent, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the head of a Sparrowhawke. The circles inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the wideneſſe and rotunditie of the world: the Serpent the great commander and conſeruer of all things therein; for among the Aegyptians and Phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicians they held that Serpents were of a diuine and ſupernaturall power, as hauing ſuch ſpeed and ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in their going, without the ſupportation of any exterior lim, carried onely by an interior ſpirit and liuelineſſe, which makes them ſo often wreſt &amp; retort their bodies with ſo many flexuous and winding tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and that they liue on the earth a wonderfull long time, as disburdening themſelues of their years, by diſpoiling and vncaſing them of their vpper skins, and ſo inſtantly againe rebecome youthfull and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous: the head of the Sparrowhawke ſignifieth nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe, promptneſſe, and agilitie. <hi>Martianus</hi> (when <note place="margin">Martianus.</note> hee writeth how Iupiter ſummoned all the gods to the marriage of Mercurie and Philologia) depictures him there impalled with a regall crowne, all adorned with moſt precious and glittering ſtones, ouer his ſhoulders he weares a thin vaile, wouen and made vp by Pallas owne hands, which appeareth all white,
<pb facs="tcp:8331:38"/>
wherein are inſerted diuerſe ſmall peeces of glaſſe, formed out into the due proportion of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſplendant ſtarres: in his right hand hee holdeth two round bals, the one wholly of gold, the other halfe gold and halfe ſiluer: in the other hand an yuorie Harpe with nine ſtrings, his ſhoes are made of the greene Smarald, and he ſitteth on a footcloth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is wrought and intexed diuerſe ſtraunge workes, with the feathers of a Peacocke, and hard by his ſide lieth a tridentall gold-emboſſed maſe. And ſo farre <hi>Martianus</hi> among manie other his deſcriptions, ſets him forth. In many Countries the Statues and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Iupiter were ſo depictured, as they thereby diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered not only what hee was, and of what vertue, power, and commaund, but gaue light as it were and admoniſhed Princes and Gouernours how to proceed in the execution of their rule and authority, as being on earth the viceroyes and vnder kings vnto Iupiter, appointed and inſtalled by him to ſee iuſtice and equitie truly and effectually miniſtred and perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. And <hi>Plutarch</hi> writeth, That in ſome places of <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> Crete were Statues erected of Iupiter, which had all the proportion and ſhape of a humane bodie, ſaue that they had no eares, ſignifying thereby, that he that commandeth in ſuperiour authoritie aboue others, ought not to be perſuaded or carried away by any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate conference, or gloſing inſinuation, but muſt ſtand vpright, firme, and ſtedfaſt, not leaning to one ſide more than to another, whereby he may be known not to fauour or partialize. And contrarily, the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians framed his picture with foure eares, as
<pb facs="tcp:8331:39"/>
that Iupiter heareth and vnderſtandeth all things, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded alſo to the wiſdome of Princes and Magiſtrats, which ought to haue information of euery cauſe or matter throughly before they deliuer out a definitiue ſentence or iudgement: and likewiſe that they receiue and admit intelligences and notices how their lawes, precepts, and edicts, are kept and obſerued among their ſubiects. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> reporteth, That among the Argiues there was erected in the temple of Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua, <note place="margin">Pauſanias.</note> the Statue of Iupiter made with three eies; two of them ſeated in their right places, and the other in the middle of his large forehead: vnderſtanding thereby, that he hath three kingdomes to gouerne and maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine: the one the heauens, as that eſpecially and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely commanded by him: the other Hell, which is there vnderſtood by the earth, which compared with the wondrous glorie and beauteous excellency of the heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s, may in that reſpect worthily merit that name: and the third kingdome is the ſea, for ſo much as <hi>Eſchylus</hi> in manie places entitleth him with the name of the lord and commander of the watrie gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note place="margin">Eſchylus.</note> and dominion. It is read alſo, that hard by the pictures of Iupiter, was alwaies placed the Image of Iuſtitia, as that kings and great potentates might not commit anie thing wherin iuſtice and right were not adminiſtred. And much to this purpoſe <hi>Plutarch</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> That in Thebes were certaine Statues and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Iupiter made without hands, demonſtrating thereby the dutie of Iuſticers, and authoriſed Officers, for that indeed they ought to bee as it were without hands; that is, that they ſhould not receaue any kind
<pb facs="tcp:8331:39"/>
of bribe or reward, nor bee corrupted with the enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing proffers of bounteous gifts, whereby they might become iniurious to the true deſeruers of right and equitie, and bee drawne to giue wrongfull iudgement vpon the truth-inferring pledant. Some there are alſo who haue defigured him without eyes, as by that meanes Iuſticers, and men authoriſed for deciding lites and controuerſies, might not ſee their deereſt friends in ſuch times of pleading, and ſo not put in mind either of friendſhip, kinred, or other occaſion to lead them to partialitie. And it is thought that this Iupiter with the Romanes, was the ſame which they then entearmed <hi>Deus Fidius,</hi> ſo reuerenced and ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red among them, whoſe picture was alwaies kept among their moſt ſacred and regarded reliques, and it was thus compoſed: There ſtood in the midſt of a Temple a great Coloſſe of marble, out of which was framed and hewen with great curioſitie of art, a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, in which were inſculped three figures, whereof one of them which ſtood and was placed on the right hand, being in the forme of a well-yeard man, full of modeſtie and grauitie, had theſe letters engrauen vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, <hi>Honor:</hi> The other on the left hand, formed into the portraiture of a woman in Matrone-like habite, carried theſe letters, <hi>Veritas.</hi> Theſe two pictures ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to hold one another hand in hand, before whom there was placed the third figure, of the proportion of a young man, of beauteous, yet ſober aſpect, on whoſe head were infixed theſe words, <hi>Deus Fidius.</hi> And thus much touching that note, taken from the writings of <hi>Pauſanias.</hi> There haue beene few Statues
<pb facs="tcp:8331:40"/>
compoſed of Iupiter, to which hath not been annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſhape of an Eagle, which bird of all others the Auncients haue moſt often appropriated vnto him, by which (as it is poetiſed) his glorious charriot is ſwiftly drawne and conueied through the airie paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. Some hold, that Iupiter when hee warred &amp; was conuerſant here below in many fights &amp; skirmiſhes, was by many ſignes and tokens giuen by an Eagle, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of proſperous and fortunate ſucceſſe, which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards fell out true, he himſelfe victoriouſly trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phing in thoſe wars: Or that as he is feared and adored among men, ſo the Eagle carrieth a ſuperioritie, and raigneth as Empreſſe ouer all other birds. Among the Eleans (a people in Greece) the Statue of Iupiter was compacted of gold and yuorie, and himſelfe ſitting vpon a regall and ſtately ſeat, was impalled with a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet, made with the leaues of an Oliue. In his right hand hee held the Image of Victoria, crowned in the ſame manner: and in his left hand a ſcepter, tempered of diuerſe and ſundrie mettals, on the top whereof was mounted the true portraiture of an Eagle: his ſhoes were all of gold, whereon was ſet forth and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painted the formes of diuerſe ſtrange beaſts and of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt flowers. The ſeat it ſelfe was cleane gold, in which was inchaſed with moſt excellent embelliſhments and curious politure, the liuely repreſentation of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny vnknowne birds and fiſhes. And this Statue was vpheld and ſupported by foure Images of Victoria, hewen out and proportioned with inimitable skill of the art Topiaria. And it is read, that in Caria (a region in the leſſer Aſia) was erected a Statue of Iupiter,
<pb facs="tcp:8331:40"/>
holding onely in one of his hands a Poleaxe, and <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> alledgeth this reaſon for it, ſaying, That <hi>Hercules</hi> after that hee had ouerthrowne and ſlaine <hi>Hippolita,</hi> Queene of the Amazones, tooke them from her and carried away among other her armes, this poleaxe, which afterwards he gaue to <hi>Omphale</hi> his wife, which by birth was of Lydia: and in this reſpect the kings of Lydia alwaies afterwards vſed to carrie with them in the warres ſuch weapon, and held and regarded it as a thing ſacred, and of a wondrous reſpect. This wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon through the ſucceſſion of maniekings in the end came to <hi>Candaules,</hi> who not vouching to carrie it himſelfe alwaies, gaue it in charge to one that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied next vnto him, who afterwards with <hi>Candaules</hi> himſelfe was ſlaine by <hi>Giges,</hi> then triumphant victor ouer thoſe warres ſo vndertaken: who among other ſpoiles and reliques, carried and brought the ſame away into Caria, which firſt the Amazonian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandreſſe ſo loſt to <hi>Hercules.</hi> And this was now infix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the one hand of this Statue, which was dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto Iupiter.

of the heauens, ſo likewiſe they entearmed and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled her the Queene and Ladie thereof, being both indeed the ſuperiour elements, which in themſelues haue greater ſtrength, vertue, and operation in the creation and encreaſe of things here below than the other two: and oftentimes alſo they take I uno for the earth, and in that reſpect acknowledged as the wife of Iupiter, in that (ſay they) there falleth from aboue a certaine powerfull and engendring ſeed on the earth, by whoſe ſtrength and vertue it receiueth means and abilitie to bring forth, maintaine, and nouriſh what we ſee here produced.

From whence it grew, that the auncients parting (as it were) and diuiding the parts of men ſeuerally and aſunder, giuing vnto euery god ſome one part, ſome another, whereof they ſhould take charge and care, haue dedicated the eye-lids vnto Iuno, in that they are placed and next adioined to our eies, by which we receaue our light and ſteps direction, and that they ſeeme to defend and protect the puritie of their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues from any hurtfull and offenſiue thing that might otherwiſe fall downe, and get in vpon them.

And although at all other times almoſt ſhee is depainted to bee drawne in her chariot by two gentle birds, yet at this approch ſhee is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to bee carried by two furious horſes.

that ſhe is goddeſſe of riches, and ſuch her weapons ſo belonging vnto her doe vnſhadow, that for riches, wealth, honour, and aduancements, men vndertake armes, and are conuerſant in the greateſt dangers of the warres. And ſhee is alſo oftentimes pictured with a ſcepter in her hand, to ſhew that ſhee hath the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing of gouernments, authorities, &amp; kingdomes: as likewiſe ſhee promiſed Paris vpon ſuch his cenſure of beautie betweene the three goddeſſes. Vnto her alſo is dedicated among the auncients, the Peacocke, as the bird cheefly appropriated vnto her, as that men are ſo drawne and allured with the deſire of ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the poſſeſſion and embracement thereof, as the diuerſe-coloured feathers of this bird, enticeth the beholders eyes more and more to view, &amp; to gaſe vpon them.

which ſuddaine wonder the afflicted and waue-toſſed ſea men tooke as an aſſured token of inſuing ſafetie, as it afterwards fell out. Whereupon it came to paſſe, that alwaies afterwards that ſtarre was inuocated and called vpon by diſtreſſed Mariners, as <hi>Seneca</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi>

And becauſe this ſtar is ſeated in the aire, and ſo Iuno her ſelfe many times taken for the aire, it pleaſed <hi>Apuleius</hi> (as I haue alreadie written) as he tooke it by tradition from the auncients to accompany this god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe with thoſe two brothers Caſtor and Pollux. It is found with <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> that in a certaine place of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>otia <note place="margin">Pauſanias.</note> there was a temple dedicated vnto Iuno, in the which was erected her Statue, of a wondrous heigth and extenſion, and it had to name as the Italian giueth it <hi>Giunone ſpoſa.</hi> The reaſon of ſuch name may be this: Iuno on a certaine time vpon ſome occaſions diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and diſcontented with Iupiter, in a great choller and furious rage departed from him and went away euen to the furtheſt parts of Eubea, he willing to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifie and calme ſuch the conceaued anger of his wife, asked aduiſe of <hi>Citheron</hi> then lord of that Countrey, how ſhe might be won, called home, and reclaimed: hee preſently aduiſed him, that hee forthwith ſhould cauſe to bee built an Image or picture of the wood of an Oke, in the due likeneſſe and proportion of a yong virgine, and couering it ouer with ſome nuptiall veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſhould procure the ſame cunningly to be cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along with him to the place where marriages were then vſed to bee ſolemniſed, that by ſuch meanes it
<pb facs="tcp:8331:43"/>
might bee blaſed abroad how a new marriage was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and the old ſpouſe for euer reiected and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken. Iupiter liking of this new-deuiſed plot, inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proceeded to the execution thereof. And in the end when all matters were readie, and hee himſelfe going with this picture in great ſolemnitie to the accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med place of marriages, Iuno vnderſtanding thereof, ſuddenly approched, and fearing indeed to bee now caſt off for euer, in great anger and iealouſie violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tore away the garments of the ſuppoſed bride, and finding it to bee a counterfeit Image, and a deuiſe made onely to reduce her to her old husband, conuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſuch her diſpleaſure into new liking &amp; fancie, and at this conceited ieaſt infinitely reioiced. Afterwards among the auncients, this day was (in remembrance of the reuniting of Iupiter and Iuno) held and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in great ſolemnization. This fable <hi>Euſebius</hi> repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth to bee by <hi>Plutarch</hi> thus vnclouded: The diſcord (ſayth hee) which ſo aroſe betweene Iupiter &amp; Iuno, <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> is nothing elſe but the diſtemperature and ſtrugling contention of the elements, from whence iſſueth the deſtruction, death, and ouerthrow of all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer; as by their quietneſſe, concordance, &amp; agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are produced and conſerued: if therefore Iuno (which is as much as a watriſh, moiſt, and windie nature) in ſuch their ſtriuing and diſagreements ouermaiſter and ſubiect Iupiter, there enſue moſt wonderfull flouds and rainie wetneſſe on the earth, as once happened in the Countrey of Beotia, being all ouercouered and drowned with the ſuperabundance of ſuch flouds and waters, till by the reuniting and
<pb facs="tcp:8331:44"/>
knitting together of the old kindneſſe betweene Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter and his ſpouſe, the waters decreaſed, ſhruncke away, and diſſipated themſelues into ſeuerall armes of the ſea, which indeed fell out euen vpon that verie in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant when Iuno pluckt away thoſe cloths, ſo inueſted vpon the Image, and diſcouered the ſubſtance and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die of an Oke: of which tree alſo it is written, that it was the firſt of all others that ſprouted forth of the earth after the departure of the vniuerſall deluge and inundation of the whole world, and which (as <hi>Heſiodus</hi> ſayth) then brought vnto mankind manifold and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drie profites and conueniences, as that by the fruits thereof, men in thoſe daies liued and receaued nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by the wood of it built and compoſed their manſions houſes and temples. The auncients here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore haue conſecrated vnto Iuno the Lillie, and thereof haue framed for her diuerſe wreaths and gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and they called it the Roſe of Iuno, becauſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beſprinckled with her milke, they turned &amp; were preſently made white, being before of a ruddie and ſanguine colour, &amp; it is thus fabulized: Iupiter (kno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wing of the old hatred, and ſpightfull malice which his wife alwaies carried towards <hi>Hercules)</hi> one day (as ſhe lay aſleepe) ſo deuiſed and brought to paſſe, as hee conueyed <hi>Hercules</hi> with great ſecrecie to the paps of Iuno, that thereby he might ſucke and draw from her ſome of her milke, whoſe vertues ſhould diſanull and fruſtrate her old conceaued ſpight, and change the ſame into a new-made loue and kindneſſe. But <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> ſucking ouergreedily, and belike pulling too hard vpon her paps, Iuno ſodainly awaked, and perceiuing
<pb facs="tcp:8331:44"/>
him ſo vnexpectedly there, whom from her ſoule ſhe ſo much hated, diſtractedly as it were ſtarted fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, and by that meanes of violence her milke ſpurting forth, and making through the element a certaine white liſt and ſtreake, called by the Aſtrologers <hi>Via lactea</hi> diſcended downe on the earth, and fell vpon thoſe Lillies, then growing ſanguine and reddiſh, which afterwards grew diſcoloured, pale, and milkie white. <hi>Tertullian</hi> writeth, That in Argos a Cittie of <note place="margin">Tertullian.</note> Greece, was erected a Statue vnto Iuno, all couered ouer, and behung with the bowes of a Vine, and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the feet of it lay the skin of a Lyon, which diſcouered thereby the hatred and diſdaine ſhe cari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards <hi>Bacchus</hi> and <hi>Hercules,</hi> both which were highly ſeated in her greateſt disfauour; much like the kindneſſe vſed of ſuch in theſe our daies, for it is poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed indeed, that ſhee was Stepmother vnto them both. Some haue depictured the Statue of Iuno in Matrones habite, holding in one hand the head of the flower Poppie, and at her feet lying a yoke as it were, or a paire of fetters: by theſe was meant the marriage knot and linke which coupleth the man and wife to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and by the Poppie the innumerable iſſue of childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, which in the world are conceaued &amp; brought forth, alluded to the numberleſſe plentie of ſeed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the head of that flower. And this was ſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated vnto her, for that with many ſhe is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and held to be the goddeſſe of Mariage.

And as they percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued in her ſundrie natures, and diuers properties, ſo they aſcribed vnto her diuers and ſeuerall names, and erected Statues and Altars vnto her, according to thoſe names, vnder which they then ſo worſhipped and adored her, who (as I haue alreadie written) was with many taken and vnderſtood for Iuno: and thoſe ſtatues and images which were dedicated vnto her, were made alſo many times of many other goddeſſes: whoſe properties ſignified them to bee in nature the ſame as the earth, as firſt <hi>Lagran Madre, la Madre de i dei, Ope, Rhea, Cibele, Veſta, Cerere, Proſerpina,</hi> anb manie others which of their places and habitations where they then remained, had their names accordingly, all ſignifying one &amp; the ſame thing, being as I haue ſaid, the Earth, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the which indeed, &amp; from whoſe fruits, all things here in the world ſeeme to receaue their life and being, and are nouriſhed &amp; conſerued by the fertileneſſe thereof, and in this reſpect ſhee was called the mother of the gods, inſomuch, as all thoſe gods of the Auncients, which were ſo ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticiouſly adored and held in that reſpectiue regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, liued here once on the earth, and were fed and maintained by the increaſes, fruits, &amp; ſuppeditaments thereof. But to returne to ſpeake of thoſe her ſeuerall names, firſt ſhee was called Ope, (who alſo was
<pb facs="tcp:8331:45"/>
the wife of Saturne) for that it ſignifies aſſiſtance, aid, and adiuuament, in that there is nothing ſo commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious, helping, or auaileable to the preſeruation of human life, as the earth with her encreaſes: wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Homer</hi> cals her the giuer of life, becauſe by her <note place="margin">Homer.</note> meanes all liuing things doe breath and enioy vitali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. And <hi>Martianus</hi> deſcribing her ſayth, That ſhee is <note place="margin">Martianus.</note> enaged, and of many yeares, and growne vp to a great bigneſſe and corpulencie, and ſaith, that notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding that ſhe is old, ſhe continually bringeth forth iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue from her wombe, being as it were encompaſſed and ſet round about with her ſonnes and daughters: ſhe goeth for the moſt part in greene veſtures, with her vpper vaile ouer her bodie, beſpotted with diuers and ſundrie colours, wherein is wrought &amp; ſet forth infinite curious knots, among which are inſerted all thoſe things which with mortall men are moſt eſtee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, as precious jems, ſtones, pearles, and other moſt rare mettals of vnknowne, and therefore vnſpeakeable values. <hi>Varro</hi> (as S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reporteth in his booke <note place="margin">Varro.</note> calle <hi>de Ciuitate dei)</hi> ſayth, that the earth is called Ops, becauſe by mans helpe, induſtrie, and labour, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commeth more rich, fertile, and increaſefull, and that the oftener it is wrought vpon, tilled, and manured, it reacheth ſtill to more plentie, perfection, and fecundi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Shee is called Proſerpina (according to the opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of many) in that the blades and ſtalkes of corne ſpring forth and grow with ſuch ſtealing and vnſeene progreſſion and faſhion of encreaſe, as the Serpent in her ſliding paces ſmoothly creepeth, and ſnekingly conueyeth her ſelfe away. Shee is entearmed Veſta;
<pb facs="tcp:8331:46"/>
becauſe ſhe ſitteth alwaies clothed and inueſted. And <hi>Varro</hi> deſcribeth the picture of Ops, (as it is taken out <note place="margin">Varro.</note> of <hi>Boccace)</hi> to be thus, and he thus expoundeth it: On her head (ſayth he) ſhe weareth a ſtately crowne, made in the forme of many towers and caſtles, in that the circuit and compaſſe of the earth is round, like the ſhape of a crowne, and is repleniſhed and filled with Citties, Caſtles, and Villages: her apparrell is wouen and compoſed of greene hearbes, all ouerſhadowed with frondiferous boughes, diſcouering thereby the infinite numbers of trees, plants, and flowers, grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the earth. In one of her hands ſhee holdeth a Scepter, which ſignifies, that in the world are manie riches, kingdomes, and gouernements, as alſo the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werfull commands and mightineſſe of terrene Lords and Potentates. By the ball which ſhee holdeth in her other hand, is meant the roundneſſe of the earth, diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded into two ſpheres: and hard by her is placed a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot with foure wheeles, which diſcouereth, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though ſhe hir ſelfe remaineth for euer firme and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moueable, yet the workes and negotiations of the world are continually altering, changing, and vnſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, according to the natures and powers of the foure ſtations of the yeare. This chariot is drawne by foure Lyons, which enucleateth either the ſubtiltie which husbandmen vſe ouer their ground, to couer &amp; hide the ſeed ſo ſoone as it is ſowne, from the greedineſſe and narrow ſearch of the birds: as Lyons (according as <hi>Solynus</hi> reporteth) are accuſtomed, when they are chaſed and hunted by woodmen to ſweepe &amp; diſperſe <note place="margin">Solinus.</note> the duſt with their tailes, that ſo the print and impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb facs="tcp:8331:46"/>
of their footing, might not detect their courſe of eſcape, or elſe to ſhew, that there is no ground ſo bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, ſtubborne, and fruitleſſe, but may in time by often cultiuation, &amp; induſtrious manuring, be made a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous &amp; fertile ſoile, as the Lyons themſelues in the end become gentle, tame, and tractable. The emptie and void ſeats which are placed round about the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, doe import, that there is no countrey ſo popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and abounding in people, but are by peſtilences, infections, diſſentions, and warres, waſted, ſpoiled, and depopulated; or to ſhew that in many places of the earth are diuerſe countries vnpeopled and deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. And thus farre <hi>Varro</hi> in his deſcription of Ops. It is read with <hi>Iſiodorus,</hi> that the Image of this god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe, <note place="margin">Iſiodorus.</note> called <hi>Lagran Madre,</hi> is framed holding in one of her hands a key, ſignifying thereby, that the earth in the time of Winter and cold ſeaſon, is locked vp (as it were) and incloſeth within it the ſeed which is diſperſed and throwne downe into it, which at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proch of the Spring and Summer doth peepe forth, and ſhew it ſelfe againe, at which time it is ſaid, that the earth is again vnlocked, and openeth her boſome. <hi>Cornelius Tacitus</hi> reporteth, That certaine people of <note place="margin">Cornelius Tacitus.</note> Germanie worſhipped and adored this goddeſſe, as ſhe that of all other was the moſt friendly &amp; helping to mankind, ſupplying their wants and neceſſities with her manifold fruits and encreaſes. And in that they erected not vnto her (as I haue in ſome places al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>readie written) any Statues, Images, or Pictures, they performed ſuch their adoration in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated groues, wherein they placed a chariot or coach, couered all
<pb facs="tcp:8331:47"/>
ouer with ſacred veſtures, vnto which no man might be ſuffered to approch and touch, but only a certaine Prieſt appointed to ſpeake to her, as hee onely that knew the goddeſſe to be there, &amp; was further acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with all her vnreuealed matters of ſecrecie, and in this reſpect they all gaue him preheminence, place, and dignitie. And this chariot was drawne very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely (and with all obſeruancie of reuerence done vnto it by the people) by two white Cowes. It is to be pre-intended, that the world in thoſe daies was not afflicted with warres, ſtratagemes, contentions, inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine broiles, and fatall maſſacres, neither knew it the vſe of yron or ſteele, the daies and yeeres were then circumfered in ioy, tranquilitie, and hearts content, all places were free, peacefull, ſecure, and quiet, &amp; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this ſight and ſolemnitie the people came flocking in, with great humility deuoting vnto her their poore ſeruices, with many gifts, preſents, and oblation. And after that this goddeſſe afterward intended to end ſuch her progreſſe, and to abide no longer below in the world, the chariot with the cloths thereof, was ſuddainely by ſome ſleightfull art throwne violently into a Lake or Riuer, with the picture of the goddeſſe in it, and the ſeruants ſo appointed for this deuiſe, all ouerwhelmed and drowned in the water. And it is thought, that this fond ceremonie encreaſed migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily their opinion and beleefe of ſuch their religion, and cauſed that ſhe was alwaies among them adored and worſhipped as a mightie goddeſſe. And this god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe was alſo called (as I haue alreadie written) Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bele, which name (according to the opinions of
<pb facs="tcp:8331:47"/>
manie) came of a certaine mount ſo entearmed. But <hi>Feſtus Pompeius</hi> giues her the ſame nature and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, <note place="margin">Feſtus Pompeius.</note> and the ſame Statues, Images, and Pictures as ſhe hath being Ops, with her chariot likewiſe drawne by two furious Lyons: which <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> likewiſe affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, when writing of many wonders and miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous <note place="margin">Ariſtotle.</note> things in the world, he remembreth in ſuch his deſcription a certaine ſtone which groweth on the hill Sipilus in Phrygia, the which who ſo had found and caried away any part of it into the Temple of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bele, he ſhould become inſtantly moſt dutifull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and regardant vnto his parents, although he had before infinitely hated, deſpiſed, and by violent and impious hands beaten them: and vnder her picture there in that temple, were placed with great curioſity of art, two ſtately and maieſtical Lyons. But <hi>Diodorus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Diodorus.</note> and manie others are of opinion, that the Lyons ſo dedicated vnto her, ſignified, that ſhe was once fed and nouriſhed by them on that Mountaine Sipilus, as it is read alſo of many others that haue beene kept aliue and preſerued by Wolues, Harts, Beares, and Serpents. The Naturaliſts, and ſuch as haue laboured for the vertue and nature of things produced, ſay that the elements admit in themſelues ſuch a coherence, communencie, and coniunction, that the one is eaſily changed into the nature of another, according as the aire becommeth indenſate and groſſe, or pure and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. And in that regard there ought to follow leſſe admiration among vs of ſuch intricate names, effects and properties of the gods of the auncients, as the one ſometimes vnderſtood for one thing, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb facs="tcp:8331:48"/>
for another, and yet all ſignifying vnder ſeuerall names and titles one and the ſame thing: as Iupiter of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes is taken for the element of Fire, ſometimes for the aire, and ſo likewiſe the Sunne and the Moone in many places taken for the ſame, and yet expoſed vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der diuerſe names. The waters alſo had diuerſe gods, ſhewing forth their ſundry qualities and effects in the ſame manner, as the earth, from whoſe boſome aſcend vp miſtie and vapourous exhalations, and are ſetled and remaine in the lower part of the aire, compoſing there thicke and conglomerated clouds, from whoſe moiſtneſſe afterward iſſue downe on the earth great vents and abundance of raine. And for this cauſe (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Fornutus)</hi> the earth is called Rhea, as it were guiltie, and being the cauſe and occaſion of ſuch <note place="margin">Fornutus.</note> ſhowers and rainie moiſtures. And the Image of this goddeſſe was ſet forth with many Cymbals and veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of water, as alſo torches, lampes, and firebrands, meaning thereby the many lightenings and ſuddain flaſhes which immediately precede the approches of violent and tempeſtuous ſhowers. The Statue of the earth (as ſhe is Veſta) is proportioned in the ſhape of a young virgine, with her apparrell beautified and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decked with many curious ornaments, and attires of ſundrie and diuerſe colours, as wee ſee the earth vpon the comming of the Summer to bee ſo gloriouſly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted with ſeuerall-ſorted flowers. But it is to bee obſerued, that among the auncients was alſo another Veſta, which as the firſt (as I haue ſaid) ſignified the earth, this intended the fire, that is, that liuely &amp; nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing heat, from which (being diſperſed into the
<pb facs="tcp:8331:48"/>
bowels of the earth) euerie thing therein contained, receiueth his being and encreaſe, and of this the aun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients ſhaped not any Image or Statue, in that it could not be diſcerned by any outward eies, but with diuine and contemplatiue thoughts, being of it ſelfe wholly celeſtiall. And beſides theſe names of the earth, it was called alſo, when of it ſelfe it proued not fertile, but induſtriouſly manured by the labours of man, by the name of Ceres, and her Statue was framed to the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude of an aged Matron, hauing her head circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct and redemyted with eares of corne, holding in her hand the ſtalke of a Poppie, in that this flower ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth fertilitie and great encreaſe. And <hi>Orpheus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Orpheus.</note> writeth, That her charriot is drawne by two furious Dragons of moſt fierce and indomitable nature. And the reaſon of it as <hi>Heſiodus</hi> reporteth is, in that in the <note place="margin">Heſiodus.</note> Iſland Salamina, ſeated by the Euboicke ſea, there li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued a moſt powerfull, angrie, and deuouring Serpent, of a moſt admirable, ſtrange, and vncouth hugeneſſe, by which indeed all that Countrey became waſted, ſpoiled, and depopulated, vntill afterwards by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerous proweſſe of <hi>Euricolus</hi> it was ouermatched, cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and expelled the Countrey, which vpon that fled into the next Prouince called Elouſis, where at that time Ceres remained, as hoping by her to bee prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted and ſafe guarded. And from that time it long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter continued there in the temple of Ceres, as her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant ſeruant and miniſter. Many alſo haue depi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured Ceres with many torches, lights, &amp; firebrands in her hands, as in the ſame manner in a temple ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vpon a promontarie of Attica was a Statue ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painted
<pb facs="tcp:8331:49"/>
by <hi>Praxitiles.</hi> The reaſon was, as ſome hold, in that ſhe had been ſo ſeene raging vp and downe in the ſearch and enquirie of her daughter Proſerpina, rauiſhed and ſtolne away by Pluto. And hetherto concerning ſuch Statues, Altars, and Depictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances.</p>

               <p>AMong the auncients Neptune was held and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to bee him of the three brothers to whoſe ſhare the kingdome of the waters fell and was allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and therefore and in that reſpect they entearmed him god of the ſea, depainting him with diuerſe and ſeuerall countenances, ſetting him forth ſometimes with mild and pleaſant lookes, at other times louring and ſad, and at other times with a mad, furious, and angrie aſpect: which is giuen him (according to <hi>Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil</hi> &amp; <hi>Homer)</hi> in that the ſea it ſelfe at ſundrie times, ſo ſheweth her ſelfe. And they deſcribe him manie times to bee naked, holding in his hand a ſiluer Trident, or forked Mace, and ſtanding vpright, as carried in the conceauitie of a huge marine ſhell, which in ſteed of a Charriot, is forciblie drawne by two monſtrous horſes, which from the middle downeward haue the due proportion and ſhape of Fiſhes, as <hi>Statius</hi> at large deſcribeth them. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they depaint him with a thinne vaile hanging ouer one of his ſhoulders of a cerulean or blewiſh colour. <hi>Lucianus</hi> (ſpeaking of certain ſacrifices offred by certaine people of Greece vnto Neptune) ſetteth <note place="margin">Lucianus.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8331:49"/>
him downe there with maruellous long hair, hanging down ouer his ſhoulders, being of a very ſad &amp; darkiſh colour. And yet <hi>Seruius</hi> and many other writers doe <note place="margin">Seruius</note> affirme, that among the auncients all their gods of the ſea were for the moſt part depainted in ſhape of old men with white and hoarie haires, as that their heads were ſo died with the froth and ſpume of the ſea. Whereupon <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> (deſcribing <hi>Glaucus</hi> being <note place="margin">Philoſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> a god alſo of the ſea) ſayth, That he had a long white beard which was very ſupple, gentle, and ſoft, &amp; that the haire of his head was alſo very white, and hung downe wet &amp; dropping about his ſhoulders, his eyes to be greene, and maruellouſly gliſtering, being hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and ſet farre into his head, his brow full of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowes, wrinckles, and greene ſpots, his breaſt all ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>growne alſo with a greeniſh coloured ſea weed or moſſe, ſomething like that which hangs to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes of ſhips after long voyages, his bellie, and from thence downeward both thighes, legs, &amp; feet, became fiſh-like full of fynnes and ſcalie, and that hee had a wonderfull long taile, all gliſtering with ſcales, which he alwaies lifted vp and aduanced aboue the waters. The three-forked Trident ſo giuen to Neptune, ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth the three gulfes of the Mediteranean ſea, which from the head thereof mainely tumbleth downe into the Ocean.

                  <note place="margin">Alexander Neapolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> reporteth, That a certaine Gentleman a neere neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour of his, and a man of worth and credite, conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affirmed, that hee had ſeene a ſeaman taken by cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine fiſhers, which at that time being dead, was all couered ouer and ſeaſoned with honny, to the end it might laſt, and continue ſweet: and that he ſaw it then in Spaine, being ſent thither from the furthermoſt parts of Affrica, as a preſent of great wonder and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, and much after this manner hee deſcribeth it: It had the face of an aged man (ſayth hee) with the haire of his beard and head wondrous rough, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne, and long, of a cerulean or azure colour, his ſtature exceeded the proportion of a man, vpon his ſhoulders grew two wings, ſuch as vpon many other fiſhes are now commonly knowne, &amp; his skin, though wonderous tough, and of great thickneſſe, yet ſhined and gliſtered very brightly. The ſame Authour adioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, That <hi>Theodorus Gaza</hi> likewiſe affirmed, that hee had ſeene a ſea-nimph or water-maid (one of thoſe which we call Nereides) by great fortune caſt a ſhore on the coaſt where hee inhabited, which ſayth he, had the true aſpect &amp; countenance of a woman of a moſt pleaſing &amp; beauteous face, but from her necke to her thighes ſhee was couered all ouer with ſcales, and ſo downeward became wholly like a fiſh: wherevpon it
<pb facs="tcp:8331:51"/>
grew, that the Poets fained ſuch Nereides to be moſt beautifull and gracious Nimphs, attending the gods and goddeſſes of the ſea, as Oceanus, Nereus, Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, Thetis, Dorida, Galatea, and others, which Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latea as <hi>Heſiodus</hi> writeth, is ſo entearmed by reaſon of the whiteneſſe of her skinne, who alſo deſcribes her haire to be milke white. <hi>Ouid</hi> ſayth, That <hi>Polifemus</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bewitched with her incomparable beautie, deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth her to bee more cleere and faire than the pureſt Lillie. <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> in a certaine tablet which hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth <note place="margin">Philoſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> of the Cyclops, depictureth Galatea drawne in a ſtraunge-framed chariot by two mightie Dolphins, on a quiet and gentle ſea, which Dolphins were gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by two ſiluer raines, held in the hands of old Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons daughters, ouer her head was carried a Canope made of Purple ſilke, and Siluer, to enſhadow her delicious face from the beautie-ſcorching furie of the ſunnes irradiance: her haire hung diſperſed ouer her ſhoulders, which with the reflection of Phoebus beames ſeemed like ſmall wires of gold, with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uourable and gentle breath of Zephirus diſſipated and ſpread abroad. The preſcribed <hi>Alexander Neapoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanus,</hi> credibly deliuereth, that one of thoſe Tritons which before we ſpake of (or as wee may tearm them) marigenous men, hauing by chance from a little caue or hollowneſſe of a rocke where he lay, eſpied a yong woman fetching water from a fountaine there hard by, vpon a ſodaine leapt out of his watry denne, ſet vpon her, and forced her violently with him into the ſea, notwithſtanding her vehement ſhrikes, and all-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deuoured reſiſtance: which being by ſome of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
<pb facs="tcp:8331:51"/>
thereabouts perceaued, though a farre off, they laid plots, &amp; conſulted among themſelues, how they might again entice him to the land by any means whatſoeuer: which afterwards they accompliſhed by ſending another maid to that fountaine, &amp; ſpreading that place all ouer with ſubtle nets, in the end they enſnared him therein, and ſo brought him aliue into the Towne; which within three daies, not being able ſo long to endure the land died. Not altogether vnlike to theſe Tritons (in reſpect of human ſhape) but more neerely indeed reſembling thoſe Nereides, are thoſe which wee entearme by the names of Syrens, in that (as it is poëtiſed) they haue alſo the face and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of a woman, &amp; ſo the reſt of their bodies aboue vnto the middle, from which downward they become fiſhes. And it is written with ſome, that theſe haue wings, and that their feet are like thoſe of a Cocke. <hi>Seruius</hi> deſcribeth that lower part of them to bee in the ſhape of a bird: as <hi>Ouid</hi> alſo remembreth, when he <note place="margin">Ouid.</note> ſayth, That thoſe were the companions of Proſerpina, which after that ſhe was rauiſhed by Pluto, were me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphiſed into ſuch formes, being halfe women, &amp; halfe birds. But howſoeuer the Poets varie in their opinions, they generally vnderſtand by thoſe Syrens the delicate pureneſſe of beautie, wantonneſſe, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, &amp; enticing allurements to the daliancie of amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous embracements. And it is read, that they ſing ſo melodiouſly, and with ſuch a ſence-beſotting ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, that the ſuſpectleſly inchaunted ſea-trauellers are infinitely beguiled and lulled aſleepe with the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony and pleaſing blandiſhment thereof, and by

that meanes are murthered and deuoured by them, as indeed it often times befalleth vnto thoſe miſerable and vnfortunate men, who bewitched with the ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cebrous and honny-dewed tongues of harlots, ſuffer themſelues to be (as it were) caſt into a ſleep, ſhutting the eyes of vnderſtanding and reaſon, and by that meanes are made a prey to thoſe deuouring &amp; gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die vulturs, &amp; in the end vtterly eaten vp, waſted, and conſumed. Whereupon <hi>Boccace</hi> reporteth, That the <note place="margin">Boccace,</note> Auncients heretofore depictured the Syrens daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and ſporting in a greene meade, which was all ouer ſpread and ſtrewed with bones and carkaſſes of dead men: vnclouding thereby the aſſuredneſſe of ruine, decay, and periſhment to thoſe that ſo voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly addict themſelues to the vnbridled affection of ſuch laſciuious and ſoule-hazarding concupiſcence. As there are many moſt ouglie monſters and ſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed creatures in the ſea (thought indeed to bee much more then on the land) ſo <hi>Homer</hi> alſo maketh eſpeciall mention of one, which hee calleth by the <note place="margin">Homer.</note> name of Scilla, which (ſayth hee) liueth in a fearefull darke and ſecret cauerne hid in the ſea, in the nature of ſome huge rocke, and who with her vncouth and lowd barking and howling, make the waters therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout mightily reſound with an incredible report and eccho of ſuch her ſtrange violations. And this mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſayth he, hath twelue feet, ſix neckes, &amp; ſix heads, and in euery mouth are placed three ranckes of moſt wonderfull huge teeth, from whence continually iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and guſheth forth a moſt deadly venomous fome: her heads are alwaies peeping forth with greedie vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilancie

               <p>Of the before-mentioned Nereides, <hi>Plato</hi> writeth, <note place="margin">Plato.</note> that there are ſuppoſed to bee a hundred, maieſtically riding on Dolphins, and alwaies attending on Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which number of them hee alſo remembreth, when he deſcribeth that ſtately &amp; magnifique temple which the Atlantickes dedicated vnto Neptune, where hee himſelfe was depictured, ſeated in a ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous chariot, holding the raines of the bridle in one hand, and a whip in the other, and his ſea-horſes gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loping with incredible ſwiftneſſe &amp; celeritie of pace: and this Statue was made with ſuch immeaſurable extenſure and height, being alſo adorned with many pillars round about, that it ſeemed a moſt wonder-worthie &amp; huge piramides, the top whereof reached vp euen to the vppermoſt roofe of the temple.</p>

                  <hi>Martianus</hi> (when hee ſpeaketh of the concouation of the gods to the marriage of Philologia) deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Neptune of a greeniſh complexion, wearing on his head a white crowne: ſignifying thereby, the ſpumie froth of the ſea, being troubled and boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly toſſed with the ouer-furious blaſts of Boreas. Among the Auncients alſo the picture and portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Neptune was ſhaped out, not much vnlike that of Oceanus, whome they called and held as the father of the watrie gods, and vnderſtanding by him all the whole powers, natures, and effects of the ſea.

Of theſe and many other ſuch ſemi-fiſhes, the Poets aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe the charge and gouernement to Proteus.

By theſe nimphs is meant the propertie and nature of the waters, and the diuers and ſeueral operations and effects thereof, the which by the Auncients were vnderſtood, not onely vnder the name of Oceanus, Neptunus, Thetis, Dorida, and Amphitrio, but alſo many times vnder the title and name of Achelous, Alpheus, and diuers others: for by the firſt is intended onely the nature of the ſalt waters, &amp; by theſe, that of Fountains, Springs, and Riuers, which likewiſe by the Auncients in thoſe daies were formed and depictured in humane ſhapes. But before I proceed any further concerning the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb facs="tcp:8331:53"/>
I will here ſomewhat touch the deſcription of the winds, becauſe hauing ſpoken of the ſea, I thinke it not here incongruent to inſert them, for that vpon the waters they commonly ſhew forth their force and power more than on the land. And although I might haue before among the treatiſes of Iuno conuenient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly remembred them, in that (according to the opinion of the Naturaliſts) the aire it ſelfe being moued and troubled, is the very wind, and that Iuno is oftentimes alſo taken for the Aire, yet it ſhall not bee ouer-much digreſſion in this place to capitulate ſome opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, as they are deliuered vnto vs by the writings of others.</p>
               <p>The winds therefore among the Auncients, were held and worſhipped as gods, and Sacrifices and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations offered vnto them accordingly, with great zeale, and many rites and ceremonious obſeruances, for ſo much as they reputed &amp; iudged all proſperous and ſucceſſefull voyages of nauigation to proceed by the fauourable quietneſſe and gentle diſpoſition of the winds, which they depictured with two ſmall wings infixed on their ſhoulders, and with a fierie and high-coloured countenance, with their cheekes puft vp and ſwolne like one that with maine force ſtriueth to ſend forth ſome forcible blaſt, their natures and qualities are diſcrepant, in that ſome ingender and thicken clouds, ſome againe with their breath expell and chaſe them away, otherſome occaſion the fall and ſprouting forth of great abundance of raine, and others againe drie vp the aire, making it thin, ſubtle, and cleere. And as in diuers manners they ſhew forth
<pb facs="tcp:8331:54"/>
their properties, natures and powers, ſo are they of the Poets diuerſly deſcribed and ſet downe, of whom it is written, that foure onely are the cheefe and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall which blowe from the foure quarters of the world, euery one ſeuerally from his owne ſeat &amp; quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as they are touched by <hi>Ouid</hi> in his diuiſion and partition of the vniuerſall frame of the world. And yet (according as <hi>Strabo</hi> reporteth) with many there are acknowledged onely two: the one called Aquilo <note place="margin">Strabo.</note> or Boreas, being the wind that blowes fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Septen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trionall, which alſo (as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> writeth) had a moſt ſtately and excellent Statue curiouſly cut out and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauen in the Temple of Iuno in Greece, frequented by the Eleans: and the other is called Auſter or No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, predominating the Southerne region of the aire, and becauſe commonly proceed from his blaſts darke ſhowers and ſtormy tempeſts, he is thus, or to the like effect deſcribed:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>All gloomie-faced, lookes the stormie South,</l>

                  <l>Of terrifying thunderbolts compact,</l>
                  <l>Which when he ſends, he denotates huge heat.</l>
                  <l>

                  <l>But from the ſame doe iſſue ſhowers of raine.</l>
               </lg>
               <p>Of theſe winds, the third is called Eurus, whoſe blaſts proceed fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Orientall parts. And the fourth, whoſe mild and gentle breath procures ſo temperate and pleaſing aire, is called Zephirus, who (for that his warme calmeneſſe and moderate blowing, is the cauſe of the flowers and hearbes better increaſes) is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Auncients to bee the husband of Flora, the goddeſſe and ladie of all ſweet-ſmelling flowers. And this ſhall be ſufficient for the winds in this place, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning now to the finiſhing of thoſe deſcriptions of the flouds and riuers, which according to the Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, were framed in the ſhape of a man, wearing long haire, and with a long milke white beard, and leaning vpon one arme, (as <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> remembreth) when he ſayth, that riuers are neuer ſtreight, or runne out right: and as <hi>Statius</hi> likewiſe depictureth the floud <note place="margin">Statius.</note> Inachus, which paſſeth through the continent of Greece, ſaying thus:</p>
               <lg>
                  <l>Amidst a fertile flowre-adorned Dale,</l>
                  <l>Wal'd round about with banckes of ſedge and willow,</l>
                  <l>Lies horned Inachus, dreirie and pale,</l>
                  <l>Leaning his head and arme (as on a pillow)</l>
                  <l>Vpon a veſſell full of water filled,</l>

               </lg>
               <p>The Riuers (according to <hi>Seruius)</hi> are framed with hornes, either becauſe the murmure and noiſe of the

               <p>THe ancients hereto fore allotted vnto euery ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral place a perticular king, gouernor, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who of that place ſo committed vnto him, ſhould take vpon him an eſpeciall care and charge, who there commanded and ruled as an abſolute lord, as it is poëtiſed of the kingdomes of the heauens, the waters, and the earth: in the partition of which, it fell out, that the gouernement of the lower center which is vnder vs, happened and was allotted vnto Pluto, which alſo with vs is called Erebus. He therefore was amongſt them then accounted the king and lord of the dead, and that hee according to the lawes of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice gaue them their puniſhments &amp; torments accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as they had deſerued, when they liued vpon the earth. Yet many writers doe affirme, that vnto that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice were appointed, and did belong the three iuſt iud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, Eacus, Rhadamantus, and Minos, of which three, ſome little here in this place ſhall be commemorated.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:8331:55"/>
                  <hi>Plato</hi> therefore ſayth, that in the times of Saturne <note place="margin">Plato.</note> thoſe lawes and orders were in practiſe and exerciſed which alſo in the firſt daies of Pluto were held &amp; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerued, and his words are theſe: There was a law (ſaith he) in thoſe times, that thoſe men which in their life time had liued well, and according to the rules of vertue and her commandements, ſhould after they were dead bee ſent and tranſported vnto the Iſland of the fortunate: and that thoſe which had liued viciou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſly and lewdly, ſhould bee conueyed to the place of horror, there to receaue condigne puniſhments, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their merits and qualities of offences. And in thoſe times (ſayth hee) when alſo Iupiter began to raigne with vſurped authoritie, all men were adiud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to puniſhments, pains, or elſe to happie pleaſures, euen the very day before the parties died. By meanes whereof many were wrongfully condemned, &amp; ſome alſo ſent to the bleſſed Iſland, that had deſerued intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable paines and tortures. The which thing Iupiter vnderſtanding by the information of <hi>Pluto,</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of that abuſe, thus anſwered. Well (ſayth hee) I wil find out a remedie for this inconuenience pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, and therewith ſeemed to be wondrous angry. This proceeds (ſayth he) in that men are adiudged, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then liuing, and who knowes not that this man, or that man hath friends and great alliances, who wil not ſticke to bribe and corrupt the Iudge for fauour and partialitie, and that this other man hath deadlie enemies and ill-wiſhers, who continually are aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uating the offence, and prouoke by vnlawfull meanes ſome wrongfull ſentence to bee denounced. As for
<pb facs="tcp:8331:56"/>
great mens faults, they are couered and hid with glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious abillements, with wealth, authoritie, noble diſcent, gentrie, and parentage, And then the Iudges themſelues being earthly, (and therefore imperfect) muſt needes giue wrongfull iudgement and verdict. We muſt therefore take ſome ſuch order, that in theſe caſes mortals muſt not bee pre-acquainted with the times when they muſt die, as now they doe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vpon commaunded <hi>Prometheus</hi> to performe it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly: for after that (ſayth hee) they ſhall be thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoiled of their earthly robes, riches, and power, and being dead and naked, ſhall appeare before Iudges likewiſe dead and naked, (which then ſhall bee void of friendſhip, partialitie, or fauour) it ſhall be an eaſie matter in this caſe to giue true and rightfull iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the qualitie and height of their offences. For the confirmation of which my purpoſe and intended decree (which I haue now reſoluedly concluded within my ſelfe) my pleaſure is, that my three ſonnes, two of them borne in Aſia, being Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nos and Rhadamantus, and another in Europe, which is Eacus, ſtanding in a certaine greene meade, out of which doe part and are diuided two ſeuerall waies, the one into Hell, and the other into Eliſum (for ſo we may now call them) ſhall bee appointed there as Iudges of the ſoules of mortals, Rhadamante iudging thoſe of Aſia, and Eacus thoſe of Europe. And that, if it fortune that any doubt or vndecided ſcruple, ſhall ariſe betweene them, that then the ſame bee referred preſently vnto Minos, that thereby hee may giue his cenſure and opinion of it: for ſo much as wee intend
<pb facs="tcp:8331:56"/>
to deale and proceed vprightly in theſe caſes, &amp; that there be not admitted therein any fauour, couſenage, or deceit. This (ſayth <hi>Plato)</hi> was the order and decree of Iupiter, which afterward was preſently effected &amp; put in execution. Firſt vpon the examination of their ſins, Rhadamantus and Eacus ſate together in two yron chaires, holding in either of their handes a white rod. And Minos (diuided from them both) was ſeated all alone, holding in his hand a golden ſcepter, who ſeemed to meditate and ponder with a muſing &amp; ſad countenance vpon the puniſhments, torments, or pleaſures, to be denounced &amp; due to the offenders. As <hi>Vliſses</hi> (according as <hi>Homer</hi> reporteth) gaue out that at his being in that infernall kingdome, hee there ſaw the three Iudges in ſuch manner ſo to doome the ſoules of men: and thus farre are the words of <hi>Plato. Martianus</hi> writeth, (where he ſpeaketh of the lower <note place="margin">Martianus.</note> region) that <hi>Pluto</hi> himſelfe ſitteth moſt maieſtically in a mightie ebon chaire, holding in one of his hands a blacke imperiall ſcepter, and on his head ſeated a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſumptuous crowne. At this left hand ſitteth his Ladie Proſerpina, attended with many furies and vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpirits, at whoſe feet lieth chained the dog Cerbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus. And further the ſame Authour proceedeth not. Vnto <hi>Pluto</hi> alſo the Auncients haue giuen a trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant chariot, drawne with foure furious blacke hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, from out whoſe fierie noſthrils proceedeth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous thicke and ill fauoured ſmoakes: which is alſo the opinion of <hi>Claudianus.</hi> Although <hi>Boccace</hi> ſpeaketh <note place="margin">Boccace.</note> only of three horſes, and that his charriot hath but three wheeles. Some write alſo, that <hi>Pluto</hi> hath his
<pb facs="tcp:8331:57"/>
head redemited and compaſſed about with a garland or wreath made of the leaues of Cipres trees, which ſignifie ſadneſſe and horror, and which are vſed in bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials, maſſacres, &amp; about dead carkaſſes. Others affirm, that the ſame garland is made of the Narciſſus leaues, for thoſe alſo are held gratefull, and are employed about dead bodies, in memorie of the vntimely death of that youth, afterwards transformed into that flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. And the like garlands alſo did thoſe furies weare which were attending on Pluto, and which were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by him to afflict the ſoules of men with ſuch meaſure of torments and paines, as their vicious and leaud life had merited and worthily deſerued, their names were Alecto, Tiſiphone, and Megaera: who in ſtead of haire to adorne their heads, had venemous Snakes and Adders encompaſſing the ſame, whoſe winding and crooked tailes hang downe diſſipated and diſparckled all about their ſhoulders, faces, and breaſts. Some writers doe alledge a fourth furie, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioined to theſe three, which they entearme by the name of Liſſa, which is as much to ſay as madneſſe, &amp; therefore they hold, that from her proceed all luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, diſtractneſſe of ſence, &amp; forgetfulneſſe of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and reaſon.

Of theſe Harpiae are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred thoſe birds which are called Striges, which alwaies flie in the night, and (as it is written) in the dead of ſilence get into mens houſes where young children are, and priuily ſucke their bloud, whereby oftentimes by loſſe of too much bloud, they miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly pine away and periſh. <hi>Statius</hi> ſayth, That theſe haue alſo the face of women, and do remaine &amp; breed in the infernal region.

goodly and faire child, at whoſe delicate feature and well-ſhaped lineaments, Iuno exceedingly repined, and in the end by her infinit ſpight and iealouſie, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to be by ſuch night ſpirits moſt cruelly murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: vpon which vnexpected and vnluckie accident, the woe-afflicted mother became almoſt frantike and diſtracted of her wits, who ſince in that miſerable paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of phrenſie vſeth to wander vp and downe, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king and contriuing all the miſcheefe, hurt, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpight to all other young children whatſoeuer.

But <hi>Dyon</hi> the hiſtorian deſcribeth <note place="margin">Dyon.</note> them in another ſort, which alſo with many is held to be the moſt probable.</p>
               <p>It is read therefore with him, that in certain deſarts &amp; vnhabited places of Lybia, are certaine moſt fierce rauening, and moſt furious beaſts, which (ſayth hee) haue the face, necke, &amp; breaſt of a woman of the moſt loue-alluring faire and delicate hue, that any art of man for a moſt perfect colour can any way inuent, who in their countenance and eyes doe retaine ſo pleaſing a grace, and ſuch attractiue and enticing ſmiles, that they doe enwrap &amp; ouercome (as it were) the beholders ſences euen with an entranced wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and amaſed admiration. The reſt of their bodie is all couered ouer with moſt hard gliſtering &amp; bright ſcales, whoſe forme downeward is of the ſhape of a moſt vglie ſerpent, fearefull and terrible. They haue not any wings, nor haue they any voice, onely like ſnakes they doe hiſſe, and make ſome ſoft noice with their lips: they are ſo infinite ſwift and nimble in run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,

that no other beaſt is thought able to ouertake them, they make their prey of wild men, by laying open, and diſcouering their delicious ſnow-white breaſts, which who ſo ſeeth, becommeth inſtantly ſo beſotted with the beautie thereof, that hee preſently deſireth the taſt of thoſe pleaſures which are promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſo faire outward ſhewes, and in comming to embrace them, they themſelues altar not in any point their countenance, vnleſſe by ſeeming to bee baſhful, modeſt, and ſhamefaſt, they ſixe their eies downward on the earth, alwaies keeping hid and ſecret their ſharpe talents and ſerpent-ſhaped tailes, vntill by ſuch their inueagling and deceitfull demeanures, they ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are poſſeſſed of the prey betweene their embrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which preſently they impoyſen to death with the venome of their ſting, and afterward doe eat and deuour them moſt greedily, whoſe mans fleſh-coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting maw is neuer filled or ſatisfied. <hi>Homer</hi> ſpeaketh of <note place="margin">Homer.</note> a certaine beaſt which was called Chimaera, which was deſcribed to haue the head of a Lyon, the bellie or middle part of a Goat, and the taile and feet of a Dragon, and from whoſe mouth iſſued forth fierie ſparckles, which alſo <hi>Virgil</hi> affirmeth in more large allowance. The neerer coniectures are, that this Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maera was not a beaſt, but a certaine high mountaine in Licia, from whoſe top ſeemed to aſcend &amp; mount flames of liuely fire (not vnlike the nature and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of thoſe of the hill Mongibell) in the vpper parts of this mountaine, in certaine hollow caues &amp; dens liued many Lyons of an extraordinarie, furious, and cruell kind: towards the bottome of it, which was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed

about with many high trees, buſhes, and thic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, were found infinite numbers of Snakes, Serpents, and Dragons, in that abundance, as the Country ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts was altogether vnfrequented and diſinhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of any human dwellers.

               <p>Concerning the ſiſters, which wee call Parcae, and which are ſaid to attend on Pluto, there are alſo three, whoſe names are Clotho, Lacheſis, and Atropos, whereof the firſt (according to the opinion of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients) taketh charge of the birth &amp; natiuities of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall men: the ſecond, of all the reſt of their life: and the laſt, of their inſtant deaths, and departure out of this world: all which three are depictured ſitting on a row, buſily employed in their ſeuerall offices, the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt ſiſter drawing out of a diſtaffe a reaſonable big thred, the ſecond winding it about a wheele, and tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſame till it became little and ſlender, and the eldeſt, which ſeemed decrepit and far in yeares, ſtood readie with her knife, (when it ſhould bee ſpun) to cut it off: and they are deſcribed to be inueſted with white vailes, and with little coronets on their heads, wrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed about with garlands, compoſed of the flowers of Narciſſus. And now to conclude with theſe deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Inferi, wee will end with that of Charon, ſuppoſed to be the ferry man of Acheron, with the
<pb facs="tcp:8331:59"/>
explication thereof, as both <hi>Boccace</hi> and <hi>Seruius</hi> haue deliuered, as alſo <hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Homer,</hi> and diuers others affirming the ſame.</p>
               <p>By Charon therefore is vnderſtood Time, which <note place="margin">Boccace.</note> Time (according to ſome opinions) is the ſon of Ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, (which is taken for the diuine and celeſtiall coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, held priuately before the world began) and from which, ſince, all things haue been produced: and as the Ancients (as I haue ſaid) ſuppoſed it to bee the father of Time, ſo likewiſe they held the Night to be the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thereof, inſomuch, as before time there was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer any matter whatſoeuer, nor any light or appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of day could bee diſcerned, and therefore this Erebus by the Auncients is placed now in darkneſſe, which is the infernall region. And whereas Charon is ſuppoſed to haue the tranſportation and paſſing ouer of the ſoules of mortall men from the one ſide of the riuer Acheron, or (as ſome call it) Stix vnto the other, it is enucleated (as it were) &amp; vnclouded thereby, that Time ſo ſoone as wee are borne and brought forth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world, doth carrie vs along by little and little vnto our deaths, and ſetteth vs ouer the riuer of Ache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, which word interpreted, ſignifieth ſorrowfulnes, for that indeed we paſſe this life with miſeries, aduer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and laments. He is deſcribed old, and yet excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ſtrong, for that Time neuer looſeth his ſtrength or vertue by the ouer-ruuning of yeares, and hee is apparrelled with a blacke and moſt noiſome ſtinking mantle, which hangeth looſely ouer his ſhoulders, whoſe ſmel nothing is almoſt able to endure, al which ſignifieth; that while men are here in this world ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect

               <p>IT hath beene alreadie largely declared, that among the Ancients manie, yea infinite numbers of gods were held and worſhipped in moſt ſtrange and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticious adoration, of which, as many of them had many places and charges to take care of, protect, and gouerne, ſo likewiſe they were to vndertake many fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, offices, and duties. By reaſon whereof, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, that alſo they had ſo many names, titles, and degrees appropriated vnto them, which is the cauſe, that the Ancients oftentimes ſhape forth &amp; engraue the effigies and forme of one god in diuerſe and ſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall faſhions, according as they were at that time to ſhew forth the qualitie, nature, and condition of ſuch
<pb facs="tcp:8331:61"/>
their then preſented deitie and working vertue. By meanes whereof, becauſe vnto Mercurie (of whome we now entreat) they attributed theſe natures, as that hee ſometimes was taken to be the god and patron of gaine and profit, ſometime of eloquence, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time alſo of theft, ſubtiltie, and deceit, they haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painted him now in this ſhape and now in that forme, and alwaies diuerſly: but the trueſt draught and ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude of his portraiture is, wherein hee is depictured and ſet forth as the meſſenger of the gods: of which office alſo there were two ſorts held and obſerued among the gods, the one was executed by Mercurie, and the other by Iris, betweene both which, all the embaſſages and errants diſpatched whereſoeuer, were done and performed: onely this difference there was, that Iris more particularly attended vpon Iuno, and was for the moſt part commanded by her onely, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe when the gods among themſelues had intended to afflict mortals with peſtilences, wars, or ſome other all ruinating miſcheefes, then was Iris commonly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in theſe fatall meſſages. And about other matters of ſports, meetings, marriages, or pleaſant affaires, Mercurie was ſolelie vſed and commaun-</p>
               <p>The Auncients therefore depictured his forme in ſhe likeneſſe &amp; ſhape of a yong man without a beard, with two ſmall wings infixed on the tops of his eares, his bodie almoſt all naked, ſaue that from his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers depended a thinne vaile, which winded &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed about all his bodie: in his right hand hee held a golden purſe, and in his left his Caducaeus or Sna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kie ſtaffe: behind him was depictured a liuely Cocke,
<pb facs="tcp:8331:61"/>
and with wings alſo on his heeles: with the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans his ſtaffe was thus deſcribed, Hee hath (ſay they) in one of his hands a ſlender white wand, about the which two ſerpents doe annodate and entwine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, whoſe heads doe meet together euen iuſt at the top thereof, as their tailes alſo doe meet at the lower end, and the one of them is a male, &amp; the other female. And this depicturance with them was called <hi>Concordia,</hi> or <hi>Signum pacis.</hi> Whereupon afterwards it grew, that Embaſſadours and great parſonages (em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in matters of ſtate) carried alwaies in their hands ſuch like ſtaffe, and were alſo called Caducea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Many who would haue depictured the portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Peace, haue taken and ſet downe this for the verie ſame, adioining vnto it ſome certaine branches of the Oliue tree. Wherevpon it is written by <hi>Virgil,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Virgil.</note> that <hi>Aeneas</hi> ſending certain Embaſſadours to the king of the Latines, cauſed them all to bee crowned with greene Oliue branches. <hi>Statius</hi> alſo ſayth, That when <note place="margin">Statius.</note> 
                  <hi>Tidaeus</hi> went to demand of <hi>Etheocles</hi> the kingdome of Thebes in the name of <hi>Polinices,</hi> hee held in his hand an Oliue branch, as a token of a peaceful Embaſſador. And that (when he could not obtaine his requeſt and demand) he violently threw it fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him on the ground, and in a furious manner ſtampt vpon it with his feet, as the ſigne of a moſt fatall and bloudie warre, which afterward was proſecuted accordingly. But now, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing taken this occaſion to ſpeak of the Oliue branch, it ſhall not be much digreſſion ſomwhat to touch the Statues of <hi>Concordia</hi> or Peace, who (according as <hi>Ariſtofanes</hi> deliuereth) was framed in the ſhape of a <note place="margin">Ariſtofanes.</note>

But returning to our firſt intended treatiſe, it hath ben al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſpoken, that Mercurie was depictured &amp; drawn forth with two wings on the top of his eares, and alſo
<pb facs="tcp:8331:62"/>
(as ſome hold) two leſſer infixed on his heeles, &amp; with his white rod or wand in his hand, as <hi>Homer</hi> alledgeth when hee ſayth: that Iupiter ſent him to Calipſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe Vliſſes and others of his companie from theſe miſcheeuous and diueliſh enchauntments, and when he was ſent alſo at another time to conduct Priamus through the Grecian campe to demand the body of his ſlaine ſonne Hector. And at another time when he was diſpatched to Aeneas, then remaining and ſoiour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning with Dido the Carthaginean Queene. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed generally of all writers hee was deſcribed in that forme: vnto thoſe feathers or wings ſo placed vpon Mercurie (who as I haue ſaid, is oftentimes taken for learning and eloquence) is compared and alluded the nature of ſpeech, diſcourſe, and words; in that they are no ſooner pronounced and deliuered from the priſon: like manſion of the mouth, but they doe as it were flie away, and are ſo ſudainely vaniſhed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, as if they had wings (as a man may ſay) to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie them away both out of ſight and hearing. And in that regard <hi>Homer</hi> oftentimes calleth them winged or <note place="margin">Homes.</note> feathered words. Almoſt all writers agree, that Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curie was depictured with very long hair on his head, and that it hung downe about his ſhoulders: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnto alſo ſome hold, that his wings were faſtened, yet <hi>Apulcius</hi> deſcribes it otherwiſe, (when hee writeth of <note place="margin">Apuleius.</note> the Comedie of the goddeſſes, ſtriuing for the gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ball) where hee ſayth, that Mercurie was ſent vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them by Iupiter, and that he appeared there like a verie youth, hardly attained to full virillitie, and that hee had very ſhort haire on his head, which looked
<pb facs="tcp:8331:63"/>
like the colour of amber, and was curled, and that for his veſtures he had only a ſubtle &amp; thinne vaile, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of purple ſilke. <hi>Martianus Capella</hi> deſcribes him to bee young alſo, but of a maruellous ſtrong &amp; <note place="margin">Martianus Capella.</note> actiue conſtitution, and of a well diſpoſed bodie, of well-knit artures, ioints, and ſinewes, and on his chin ſayth hee, begin to ſprout forth and ſhew themſelues, certaine young haires of a yellowiſh colour. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his opinion is <hi>Statius.</hi> But <hi>Lucianus</hi> deſcribeth him without either his Caduceas, or any ſuch wings <note place="margin">Lucianus.</note> ſo infixed vpon him, or that hee had any ſuch yellow haire, but ſayth, that hee lookt like a luſtie yong man, powerfull and vigorous, and that hee was very skilfull and well exerciſed in running, wraſtling, and actiuitie <note place="margin">Philoſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> Wherof likewiſe <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> ſpeaketh when he ſayth, that Paleſtra was the daughter of Mercurie (which ſince wee haue entearmed by the name of wraſtling) and that ſhee was ſo indifferently formed, that it was very hard to iudge her either for a man or woman: for ſayth hee, her countenance ſeemed both youthfull &amp; maidenly, her haire not altogether ſo long as a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, nor ſo ſhort as a mans, her breaſts were delicate and white, and yet ſmall and ſlender, her generall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion euery way pleaſing, and yet nothing effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and hee deſcribes her there, ſitting in a greene meade, holding betweene her naked breaſts an Oliue branch, gratefull and acceptable vnto her, in that the wraſtlers (called alſo Paleſtrians, which did cuſtoma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly vſe thoſe kind of exerciſes) vſed to annoint their bodies before they attempted their ſports, with the oyle of Oliues. And thus <hi>Philostratus</hi> depainteth her,
<pb facs="tcp:8331:63"/>
ſaying, that ſhe was the daughter of Mercury, becauſe it is read indeed, that he was the firſt inuenter &amp; ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vp of thoſe exerciſes of wraſtling, leaping, &amp; other actiue &amp; agile performances. And for this and other cauſes the Ancients worſhipped and adored as a god, Mercurie, vnto whom alſo, they attribute the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſing and finding out of Letters, Muſicke, and Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrie. Hee was taken alſo for the god of Trafficke &amp; Marchandiſes, as that vnto thoſe kind of profeſſours it is fit and neceſſarie to haue eloquence, knowledge, and ſubtiletie of wit for the better managing &amp; han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling their deceitfull affaires, wherevpon <hi>Fulgentius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Fulgentius.</note> ſayth, That the wings ſo depictured on the heeles of Mercurie, ſignifie the courſe of thoſe that do traffick, which (ſayth hee) is alwaies vncertaine and full of doubt, now proſperous, and anone vnfortunate, and that they themſelues are carried vp and lifted vp (as it were) with the wings of hope, and aſſurance of good ſucceſſe, and many times alſo deſpairing, &amp; that they are continually vexed with vn-aſſured thoughts, and diſquieting vigilancie; the which thing the Cock, pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced behind this god, doth ſignifie &amp; diſcloſe, although with ſome it is held, that this Cocke rather meaneth the watchfulneſſe and waking ſtudies of learned men, for ſo much as for thoſe kind of men that profeſſed letters, it was held an odious thing in thoſe daies to ſpend the whole night in ſleepe and drowſie cogitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. And therefore Mercurie was often taken for that light of knowledge, &amp; ſpirit of vnderſtanding, which guides men to the true conceauement of darke and enigmaticall ſentences. And yet notwithſtanding,
<pb facs="tcp:8331:64"/>
naturall and ſeaſonable reſt and repoſe was altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo in thoſe times allowed as the refreſher of mens wits. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> writeth (ſpeaking of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie <note place="margin">Pauſanias.</note> of Corinth) that with the Trezemyans there was erected an altar, on which were performed &amp; offered certaine Sacrifices and oblations to the Muſes, and vnto Sleep, as ioining them both together, &amp; accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Sleepe to bee a greater friend, and more agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Muſes than vnto any other god or goddeſſe whatſoeuer, vnto which Sleepe alſo they erected Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, Images, and Pictures, adoring him with great zeale, reuerence, and veneration, as ſuppoſing him to be a great god, and the giuer of eaſe and quiet, &amp; the mittigater and allaier of great and heauie labors. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Homer</hi> &amp; <hi>Heſiodus,</hi> Sleepe was accounted the brother of death, the which thing alſo the Images inſculped in the curiouſly-engraued cheſt of Cipſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, liuely explained, wherein was inchaſed and ſet forth the true reſemblance and portraiture of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, of a moſt ſoure, louring, &amp; ſad aſpect, ſomething growne in yeares and elderly, who in her left hand held a young child, of a reaſonable &amp; ordinarie beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and in her right arm another child of a moſt ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh, blacke, and dull complexion, hauing his legs and armes growing maruellous crooked; both theſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were cut out and faſhioned with their eies ſhut, the firſt was Sleepe, and the other Death, being both brothers and twinnes: the woman that held them ſo in her armes, was Night, and mother vnto them both. This Night alſo hath been defigured by the Ancients in forme of an old woman, hauing two great wings
<pb facs="tcp:8331:64"/>
growing on her ſhoulders, all coleblacke and ſpread abroad, as if they ſeemed to offer a flight, and that ſhe is drawne alſo in a charriot, whoſe foure wheeles are made of Ebonie. <hi>Boccace</hi> ſayth, That the wheeles ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſignifie the foure parts of the night ſo diuided and diſtinguiſhed by Martiners, as alſo of ſouldiors vpon their guards. And hee there alſo affirmeth, that ſhee looketh with a very heauie and ſad countenance, but her vpper garment or vaile being of a black ſubſtance is notwithſtanding depainted and adulterated with ſundrie ſpots of ſiluer, made to the true aſſimilitude and ſhape of ſtarres, which (ſayth hee) is alluded to the beauteous ornament of the heauens. <hi>Tibullus</hi> ſayth, That the Night like a graue Matron is alwayes attended &amp; waited vpon with all her children, which are ſaid to be, Death, Sleepe, the Starres, Melancholie, and many others. <hi>Philostratus</hi> in a Tablet (which hee <note place="margin">Philoſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> made for <hi>Amphiarus)</hi> depainteth there the portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Sleepe in the ſhape of an aged woman, all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zie, ſlouthfull, and ſluggiſh, and that ſhee was habited with two ſeuerall veſtments; that aboue was white, and the other vnder that, all blacke, by the one is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the day, and the other the night: &amp; ſhe held in one of her hands a horne, from which ſhee ſeemed to poure forth vpon mortall men the ſeed of reſt, eaſe, and quiet. <hi>Ouid</hi> deſcribing her place of her habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <note place="margin">Ouid.</note> ſayth, That ſhe dwelleth with the Cimerians (peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple which by reaſon of the abſence of the ſunnes illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination) haue continuall darkeneſſe. <hi>Homer</hi> ſetreth <note place="margin">Homer.</note> downe her dwelling place to bee in Lemnos, an Iſland embrac'd by the Egean ſea. <hi>Statius</hi> ſayth, That ſhee <note place="margin">Statius.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8331:65"/>
abideth with the people of Ethiopia. And <hi>Arioſto</hi> writeth of her abode to bee in the furthermoſt nooke or corner of Arabia. But <hi>Ouid</hi> (as I haue ſaid) ſpeaking of her habitation to bee with the Cimerians, ſayth al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, That the bed ſhee reſteth vpon, is made of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and blackeſt Ebonie, couered all ouer with blacke veſtures or attillatures, &amp; that on the top of the bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead are framed forth in moſt excellent and curious manner, an infinite multitude of dreames, of diuerſe and ſeuerall natures figured out and expoſed.

               <p>It is read therefore, that vnto the Statues and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges dedicated vnto Mercurie (thoſe eſpecially which were erected in publike ſtreets and high waies) it was the vſe and cuſtome for euery paſſenger that paſſed by, to throw ſtones, ſtickes, or other ſuch like, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding as vpon the firſt veiw, or by chance they happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vpon them, by reaſon whereof, about thoſe Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in very ſhort time, were raiſed very great hils on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſtones: by which is either ſignified, that the gods (ſo adored in thoſe daies) were to bee reuerenced and worſhipped with all thoſe things, which at the firſt ſight preſented themſelues, thereby offering them vp (as it were) as an oblation vnto them; or elſe it did meane, that Learning, Diſcourſe, and Knowledge, is compacted and made of little parcels and peeces of phraſes, figures, and ſentences, as that hill was grown to mightineſſe &amp; huge proportion, by heaping and entermingling of thoſe little ſtones ſo particularlie
<pb facs="tcp:8331:65"/>
gathered together, and accumulated by the paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
               <p>The Auncients alſo haue aſcribed vnto Mercurie the charge, care, &amp; protection of ſheepheards, which <hi>Homer</hi> likewiſe ſeemeth to confirme, when hee ſayth, that Phorbus was the richeſt in cattell and heards of beaſts of all the Troians whatſoeuer, whome Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie (ſayth hee) fauouring and affecting, had raiſed and aduanced to that wealth and happineſſe. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Pauſanias.</note> writeth, That in a certaine Prouine of Corinth in a high way, was erected an Image or Statue of Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, wholly compoſed of braſſe, at whoſe right ſide was depictured forth a Lambe, lying on the ground. The ſame Author alſo ſayth, That there was another of the like held in great reuerence among the Tana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greans, people of Beotia, on the ſhoulders of which picture was drawne forth, ſitting, the portraiture of a Ram with golden hornes, and the reaſon of it was, in that (as they held) Mercurie was ſeene to go in ſuch ſort with a Ram on his ſhoulders, round about the wals of a Cittie in Beotia, when hee cauſed a moſt greeuous and infectious peſtilence to ceaſe, which had almoſt periſhed and conſumed all the inhabitants of that citty. Wherevpon it was alwaies afterward obſcrued, that vpon the celebration and ſolemnizing of the feaſt of Mercurie, there was appointed a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull young man, who ſhould that day three times go round about the wals of the cittie, with a Ram on his ſhoulders. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſpeaketh alſo of another kind of <note place="margin">Pauſanias.</note> Statue, which was brought from Arcadia vnto Rome, and there erected in the temple of Iupiter Olympi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,
<pb facs="tcp:8331:66"/>
which on his head had a helmet of engrauen Steele, and ouer his ſhoulders was caſt a Souldiours coat, who held alſo vnder his arme the ſhape of a Ram.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Macrobius,</hi> who is of opinion, That by all the gods of the Auncients were vnderſtood the ſeuerall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues <note place="margin">Macrobius.</note> of the Sunne, ſayth, that the wings ſo giuen to Mercurie (as is before touched) doe ſignifie the ſwift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and velocitie of the Sunnes expedition in the Zodiake. And that whereas it is written, that hee ſlue Argos the guardian and keeper of the daughter of Inachus, transformed afterward into a Cow, he ſayth, that that Argos ſuppoſed to haue ſo many eies, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but the heauens, beautified with ſo many ſtarres, which beholdeth and gouerneth the earth: which earth alſo the Aegyptians in their ſacred let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters framed in the likeneſſe of a Cowe, ſo that Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie (who is alſo oftentimes taken for the ſunne) thus killing Argus, is only the baniſhing, vanquiſhing, or putting to flight of the ſtars in the firmament, which (as it were) hide themſelues vpon the firſt appropin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation of the ſuns all glorious reſplendencie. <hi>Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus</hi> ſayth, That Philologia entering into the ſecond heauens, ſaw there comming towards her a Virgine, <note place="margin">Martianus</note> holding in one of her hands a certaine tablet, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in were interſected many deſcriptions, properties, conditions, and figures of Mercurie. In the midſt of which was liuely proportioned a certaine Birde of Aegypt like vnto a Storke, which with them was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led lbis, and alſo the head of a young man with long yellow haire, &amp; round about it ſeemed to twine two
<pb facs="tcp:8331:66"/>
young Serpents. Vnder that was drawn a white wand all gilded at the top, in the midſt of it of a greeniſh colour, and towards the end coale blacke. On the right hand of it was depictured a great ſhel of ſome ſtrange fiſh, and alſo a Scorpion: and on the left ſide was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painted a Goat, &amp; a little bird, much like vnto a Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row-hawke: all which depicturances containe within themſelues the myſteries and darke meanings of the Aegyptians, with whom Mercurie was worſhipped &amp; adored vnder the name of that god, which with them was called Anubis, and was depictured alſo with his Caduceus, as <hi>Apuleius</hi> likewiſe (where hee writeth of <note place="margin">Apuleius.</note> certaine tales of thoſe people which trauelled with Iſis) depainteth him. And ſayth, that Anubis (which the Aegyptians called Mercurie) was ſetforth &amp; depi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured ſometimes of a blacke and ſwartiſh complexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſometimes alſo very beautifull, and of a faire aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. And among ſome of them alſo they framed his Image, as hauing the head of a Dog, in his right hand holding a Snakie wand, and with his left ſhaking a greenebough of Palme. By the head of the Dog was vnderſtood the ſubtiletie &amp; craftineſſe which procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from Mercurie, for ſo much as there is thought no beaſt to be ſo wiſe, capable, and wilie as the Dog: Or elſe they ſo ſhaped him with the head of a Dog, for that (as it is written by <hi>Diodorus Siculus)</hi> this Anu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis <note place="margin">Diodorus Siculus.</note> was the ſonne of Oſiris, who long before that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing his father in the warres, ſhewed himſelfe ſo valerous and approued hardie, as that indeed after he was dead, hee was worſhipped &amp; honoured as a god. And for that in his life time, hee alwaies carried de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painted
<pb facs="tcp:8331:67"/>
in his ſhield the portraiture of a Dog, defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guring the ſame alſo vpon all his other armes, his Image or Statue was afterward in that manner drawn and ſet forth with a Dogs head, demonſtrating alſo thereby, that hee was louing, faithfull, and obedient to his father, defending him alwaies from all dangers, abuſes, and perrillous accidents, which alſo is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monlie ſeene in that beaſt towards his maiſter or keeper.</p>
               <p>There be ſome haue written, that Mercurie was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken &amp; held for the very ſame as <hi>Hercules,</hi> or not much different fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him, as his Image or Picture held among the French men manifeſted, which people likewiſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored him as the god of Wiſdome &amp; Eloquence, and his Statue was thus compoſed:</p>
               <p>There was hewen and cut out with moſt exquiſite skill and care of the workmen, an excelently well-pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned Image, in the ſimilitude and ſhape of a very aged man, euen decrepit as it ſhould ſeeme, and in the extremitie of yeares, his head almoſt bald, ſauing that on the ſides remained ſome few haires, ſhort, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, his countenance ſeuere, grim, and ſoure, his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of a tawnie and time-worne hue, his vpper veſture was the skin of a Lyon, and in his right hand he held an vnweldy and huge poleaxe, in his left hand an yron bow, and at his backe hung a quiuer of ſteele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed arrowes, to the end of his tongue were faſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and annexed many ſmall chaines &amp; linkes of gold, with which hee ſeemed to pull and draw vnto him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite multitudes of men of ſundry Nations, which were alſo tied and faſtened to thoſe chaines, and yet
<pb facs="tcp:8331:67"/>
of themſelues ſeemed voluntarily to follow him, the picture looking alwaies backeward to behold ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable troopes flocking towards him. And this peece of worke was framed with inexplicable &amp; rare perfection of knowledge, beautified &amp; adorned with delicate politure and true couching and conclauſture of thoſe hard and almoſt impenetrable ſtones. By the deſcription and ſetting forth of which, is diſcouered and vnript (as it were) the all-drawing force, and attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue power of eloquence, ſo attributed &amp; aſcribed by theſe people vnto <hi>Hercules.</hi> In framing him old and in yeeres, is vnderſtood, that in men of experience and long ſtudies, eloquence is of more vertue and power, as attained vnto naturitie of perfection, being indeed raw (and therefore not well digeſted) in yonger yeeres which of neceſſitie muſt want iudgement and a ſetled experience to adioine vnto it, by which it is made more forcible, preuailing, and gracious, as <hi>Homer</hi> at large &amp; copiouſly ſpeaketh thereof in his commends and praiſes of Neſtor. From whoſe mouth (ſayth hee) moſt fluently ruſhed forth ſtreames of dulcet honny, and whoſe penne diſtilled ſugred drops of delicious ſweetneſſe, and whoſe workes and fruits ſo compleat &amp; adorned with golden ſentences, aſſuageth the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice of time, and mittigateth and allaieth her ſpight of forgetfulneſſe, whoſe perpetuitie is engrauen in the braſſe-leaued bookes of neuer-dying memorie. And thus much concerning the Statues, Images, Pictures, and Deſcriptions made of Mercurie, held among the Ancients to be the god of craft and eloquence.</p>

               <p>IT is manifeſt, that the knowledge of neuer ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things without either a grace, or a certaine kind of pleaſing deliuerie of the ſame, is not abſolutely exquiſite in praiſe; yet merritting due commends, though not in the excellencie or height thereof: ſo likewiſe to ſpeake much, and to enter into the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling or diſcourſe of many matters for one that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth little, &amp; is but ſleightly trauelled in the truly-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaued paths of literature; not only diſcouers an ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducated rudeneſſe, and lame ignorance of letters, but oftentimes induceth vnto himſelfe danger, and may offend very highly, as <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> at large and learnedly hath written. As therefore among the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients Mercurie was taken and held (in reſpect of his melliſluous and honny-dewed tongue of deliuerie) for the god of eloquence: ſo likewiſe was Minerua reuerenced and adored amongſt them, for the Queen and Goddeſſe of Wiſedome, Learning, and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. And to let vs vnderſtand, that it is requiſite (as before is ſomething touched) to know very well what we vndertake to ſpeake and diſcourſe of, and to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend a right conceauement what wee ſuppoſe wee know indeed, to argue with ſhort and pithie diſputes, thereby to pull on attention, and auoid the miſerie of being thought to be tedious; to contend mildly, and laſtly, to write methodically, and with a good grace, (being indeed a ſpeciall introducement of a reading ſpirit) the Ancients haue thought fit to conioine the
<pb facs="tcp:8331:68"/>
Statues of this god &amp; goddeſſe together, as betweene whom reſted a kind of Sympathie and concordance of diſpoſitions, and they called it by a Greeke name, <hi>Hermathena,</hi> for that the Grecians entearmed Mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie Hermes, and Minerua they called Athena. And they vſed to erect this Picture or Image, alwaies in ſchooles, intending thereby to put ſchollers in mind, that they ought to embrace knowledge with elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, making thereof a compoſed medling and entermixing, as that by the one, the other receaued farre greater vertue, grace, and perfection by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of both their powers together.</p>
               <p>And it was held among the Auncients, that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and Knowledge was not only neceſſarie, and to be acquired ſolely in Citties, and in priuate &amp; dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall gouernements, but alſo to be entertained &amp; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced abroad in the warres, among Generals, Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, and all ſorts of commanders: therefore they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute vnto Minerua the care &amp; charge of the wars, and depicture her in her Statue all armed like a vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant commandreſſe, as it is recorded that ſhee ſhewed her ſelfe very gallant, valerous, and forward in the warres, held betweene the gods &amp; the Gyants, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in (as it is written with ſome) ſhee hand to hand ſlew Pallantes the moſt fierce, terrible, and mightieſt of them all.

Many haue written alſo, that Bellona was goddeſſe of the warres, and the ſame as Minerua, but by their Statues and Images dedicated vnto them, theſe diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences doe appeare: By Minerua was vnderſtood and intended the wiſe councels and aduiſed prudencie of Captaines and Officers, in managing their militarie affaires: and by Bellona were meant all bloudie ſtrata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems, maſſacres, ſurpriſes, executions, and fatall mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the enemie whatſoeuer, and therfore ſhe was depictured to hold in one of her hands a whip of red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hotyron ſtrings, and in her other hand a great earthen baſen, filled vp with coniealed bloud, ſhee was held alſo to be the goddeſſe of wrath, furie, and anger, and many times depainted with a trumpet at her mouth, as ſhee that gaue the ſigne of battell, and of generall encounters. But moſt writers doe agree, that ſhee was moſt commonly depictured with a flaming firebrand in her hand, for that the Auncients (as it is read with <hi>Licofrones)</hi> before the vſe of the Trumpets was found <note place="margin">Licofrones.</note> out, when they intended to giue a ſignall or token of battell, accuſtomed to ſend a ſlaue before the campe of the enemie with a flaming torch or firebrand in his hand, the which after that hee had ſhaken three times in his hand, would throw it downe towards the face of the enemie, and preſently after begun their battell &amp; furious encounters on both ſides. <hi>Claudianus</hi> &amp; <hi>Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> doe report, that this Bellona was the firſt that was ſeene to carrie in her hands this fierie token of fight. And thus much ſhall ſuffice for her deſcription as ſhe is taken for Bellona.</p>
               <p>Minerua by moſt writers was depictured in the
<pb facs="tcp:8331:69"/>
ſhape of a young woman, of a liuely and freſh coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, yet ſomething threatening and angrie in hir lookes, her eyes were very fixe, aſſured, and ſtedfaſt, and much like the colour of a blewiſh greene, or that of a troubled ſea, and ſhee was armed complete at all peeces, with a long ſpeare in one hand, &amp; on hir other arme a ſhield or target, made of the pureſt Chriſtall, on the top of her helmet was placed a garland, made of Oliue branches, and hard by her ſide were drawne forth, and portraied two young children with naked kniues in their hands, ſeeming (as it might appeare by their lookes) to menace one another, the one was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Feare, the other Horror, as that thoſe two alwaies waited, and were conuerſant in warres and bloudie controuerſies. Wherevpon <hi>Statius</hi> (writing that Mars <note place="margin">Statius.</note> commanded by Iupiter to ſet warres and quarrels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Argiues and Thebans) ſayth there, that Mars ſent before him thoſe two, Feare, and Horror. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> writeth, that the picture of Feare was ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped forth in ſeuerall formes by the Auncients, as that <note place="margin">Pauſanias.</note> ſometimes it was made with the head of a Lyon, terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and furious; which manner was vſed much by the Grecians, and which forme was engrauen on the ſhield of Agamemnon: with ſome other it was fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with the face and bodie of a woman, but of ſo vg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and deformed countenance as is poſſible to imagin. The Corinthians dedicated this picture ſo made, vnto the ſonnes of Medea, ſlaine and murthered for brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſuch fatall gifts to the daughter of old Creon, whereby ſhe and all that regall familie periſhed, and were for euer extinct.</p>

The Oliue tree was conſecrated to Minerua, for that (as <hi>Virgil</hi> ſayth) the Athenians vſed to crown the <note place="margin">Virgil.</note> heads of Conquerors and triumphant commanders, with garlands thereof. Many writers doe diſagree in the deſcription of Minerua, and eſpecially thoſe of Greece. Touching the birth of her, it is written, that ſhe was borne without a mother, and that ſhee iſſued and came forth into the world out of the head of Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter (according to the opinion of all fantaſticke Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets.) By which is meant &amp; vnderſtood, that all human knowledge and vnderſtanding proceedeth from the ſuperior and diuine guidance aboue, whereby theſe intellectuall parts become celeſtiall, and deſpiſers of terrene delights. But <hi>Martianus</hi> interpretes it to the diſgrace of women, (being indeed a great and ſore enemie vnto all that ſexe) but (his expoſition being too ſeuere and rigorous in that behalfe) it ſhall not be pertinent further to declare it. Whoſe opinion alſo <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> himſelfe ſomething embraced, affirming (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too much opinionated therein) that as Minerua <note place="margin">Ariſtotle.</note> was borne without a mother, ſo all women generally are of themſelues without wit, knowledge, ſecrecie, or aſſured conſtancie: but ſuch inuention proceedes onely of malice, and ſome other ſeed of rancour, which was indeed irradicated in his breaſt againſt that praiſe-worthie ſexe. Wherin I dare in ſome ſort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> in that (it is apparent) that there are in the world women of as great ſpirit, wit, capacitie, and ſetled reſolutions as moſt men are, and are as elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in deliuery of their thoughts, &amp; as ſcholler-like in chuſing fit and ſignificant words, in compoſing &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:8331:70"/>
annexing their pithie, ſententious, and well-placed phraſes, as moſt men are whatſoeuer (exempting ſome famous profeſſed Doctors, and daily Students.) But returning to Minerua, the Auncients (as I haue ſaid) framed her Statue to be all armed throughout, in the faſhion of a moſt valerous and hardie warrior: &amp; ſhe wore on her head a wonderfull rich helmet, all made and hammered of maſſie gold, which with the beauty thereof ſhined moſt gloriouſly, ſending forth a moſt excellent luſtre, and delicate tranſparencie. <hi>Homer</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Homer.</note> ſayth, That by this helmet ſo infixed on her head, is ſignified, that the wit and policie of man (which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies reſteth in the braine of the head) is (as a man may ſay) ſo armed, and at all times prouided &amp; readie, that it deſendeth the bodie from all eminent dangers, miſcheefes, and inconueniences, &amp; that it doth ſhine, &amp; is made beautifull with vertuous &amp; worthie works, ſtudies of contemplation, and diuine meditations. The ſame <hi>Homer</hi> ſayth, That the excellent wit of man <note place="margin">Homer.</note> doth neuer diſcouer all that it knowes, nor yet leaueth all that it diſcourſeth of, eaſily to be vnderſtood &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued: wherein ſuch words are co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pared to the doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full anſweres of an Oracle, or the darke and intricate ſpeeches of Sphinx: whereby belike it came, that in a certaine part of Aegypt, they placed in the temple of Minerua, the Statue and portraiture of this Sphinx, which the people there reuerenced &amp; adored, belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing it to be the goddeſſe Iſis.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pauſanias</hi> (ſpeaking of the Athenians) ſayth, That <note place="margin">Pauſanias.</note> there was in that countrie a very ſtately, and curiouſly built Image of Minerua, which had engrauen on the
<pb facs="tcp:8331:71"/>
top of the helmet the ſhape &amp; forme of Sphinx, and on both ſides of it were cut out &amp; carued the portrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of two Griffins, which are held indeed to be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther beaſts nor birds, but doe equally partake of both kinds, for they haue the vpper part (as the head, necke and wings) of an Eagle, and the reſt of their bodies ſhaped to the true ſimilitude of Lyons. Theſe ſtrange formed beaſts are found to remaine (though <hi>Pliny</hi> ſets them downe as fabulous) in the furthermoſt parts of Scythia, where (as it is written) are certaine mines of gold and ſiluer, which theſe Griffins doe continually guard and keepe, ſo that the people of that Country, being called Arimaſpes (which as many writers affirm haue but one eye in their forehead) cannot without great danger and hazard of their liues dig or ſeach for any of that gold.</p>
               <p>On the top alſo of that helmet ſo made for Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua, ſomeimes they placed the forme of a Cocke, as in one part of Greece (inhabited by the Eleans) there was ſuch a Statue erected &amp; made by Phidias, which was wholly framed of gold and yuorie, which was ſo conſecrated and dedicated vnto Minerua, becauſe that bird of all others is moſt fierce, bold, and hardie in his fight, as likewiſe in Captaines and men of war, is requiſite and required: or els it did demonſtrat ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the vigilancie and wakefull cogitations of great commanders and wiſe Gouernors, in whom is requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red great foreſight, watchfulneſſe, &amp; care. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I muſt ſomewhat digreſſe from this treatiſe of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerua, to obſerue my Authour, who in this place hath inſerted ſome few capitulations of other abſtracts, the

               <p>It is written with many Authors, &amp; eſpecially with <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> that the effigies and portraiture of Truth <note place="margin">Hipocrates.</note> was framed in the due ſimilitude &amp; likeneſſe of a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous young woman, attired with very graue &amp; mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt abillements, and yet for that kind of elderly ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite, very rich and coſtly. And the ſame Authour alſo depainteth there the ſhape of Opinion, likewiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling a young woman, not altogether ſo faire &amp; louely, and yet not deformed or ill proportioned: who (ſaith he) ſeemed rather impudent than modeſtly bold, in all her demeanures, with her hands reaching forth to take and receaue whatſoeuer is offered and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Lucianus</hi> ſpeaking of a certaine Temple dedicated <note place="margin">Lucianus.</note> vnto Truth, ſayth, that in the midſt thereof was ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted her Image or Statue in the forme of a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, all ſorrowfull, ſad, and diſcontent, habited in vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemely rags and baſe attire, and (as it ſhould ſeeme by certaine ſuperſcriptions ouer the head) ſhee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that ſhe was ill-intreated, abuſed, &amp; wronged by Fortune.</p>
               <p>In many places (eſpecially in Greece) Vertue hath been ſhaped forth in forme of a Pilgrime or trauel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, in that ſhe findeth no reſting place, ſecure abode, or certaine habitation, being ſometimes vexed &amp; op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt by the gouernement of Tyrants, ſometimes of Vſurers, and auaricious commanders, ſometimes by luxurious Rulers, &amp; ſometimes alſo by the furie and chances of warres, inteſtine ſeditions, &amp; ciuil broiles. Sometimes ſhe is defigured forth like a graue and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtere Matrone, ſitting vpon a foure-ſquared ſtone, all ſolitarie, penſiue, and melancholie, and leaning her head vpon her knees, as though ſhee ſeemed wearie of her life, being ſo full of croſſes, miſeries, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations.</p>
               <p>It is written with <hi>Zenophon</hi> and <hi>Marcus Tullius,</hi> that Hercules when he was in his adoleſcencie, and <note place="margin">Zenophon.</note> prime of his blooming daies, wandering by chaunce
<pb facs="tcp:8331:72"/>
in a deſart and vnfrequented wood, came where two ſeuerall waies diuided themſelues in two contrarie courſes, the one leading directly into the wood, and the other enclining on the one ſide thereof: Hercules as vncertain which of theſe two he ſhould take, ſtood pondering and conſidering of the choice, hee had not long ſtood thus reuoluing within himſelfe, but there appeared before him (all on the ſudaine) two women, the one of which was called Pleaſure, who indeed was wondrous beautifull to the eye, and of a louely aſpect, wanton in her demeanure, and exceeding plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in all her geſtures, and ſhee was apparrelled with verie glorious and gorgeous abillements, whoſe eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dazeling brightneſſe amaſed Hercules with huge ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration thereof, ſhe was ſo adorned and decked with reſplendant iewels, and gliſtering ſtones, &amp; this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſeemed to perſuade him to take the way of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſualitie &amp; delights, which at the firſt entrance appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red vnto him very large, faire, and eaſie, beſet with ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleaſant and greene hearbes, and diuers-coloured flowers, but towards the end it grew very ſtreit, ſtony, rough, and full of ſharpe-pricking thornes: the other woman (ſomewhat more graue &amp; ſetled in her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance) was called Vertue, who was clothed with verie ſimple and meane garments, and ſhee with her finger pointed vnto that way which ſhee would wiſh Hercules to take, which indeed at the beginning ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed it ſelfe very narrow, full of rockes, and ſteepe-aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending banckes, verie crooked, and almoſt in-acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſable; but after towards the midſt it ſhewed very ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and at the very end of it was a moſt delicat green
<pb facs="tcp:8331:73"/>
mead, all beſet and enwalled with trees of the rareſt and daintieſt fruits that could bee wiſhed for, the vale it ſelfe all beſpangled (as it were) with field-flowers of ſundry ſorts and colours, entermixed with the odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous roſe, gillowflower, marigold, &amp; pinke: through the midſt of this greene plot, glided and ſtole along a ſoft-murmuring chriſtall ſpring, through the puritie of whoſe cleereneſſe (by meanes of the reflection of the ſunnes beames) an infinite number of golden he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed peble ſtones, daunced as it were, &amp; leaped on the ſands, as moued and ſtirred with the ſwift-paced cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of that faire-running water: and vnto this path Hercules betooke himſelfe, labouring &amp; ſtriuing very eagerlie to paſſe in at the firſt entrance, which at the length, with continuing and laborious endeauours, he recouered, &amp; ſo attained to that delicious &amp; beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifull medow, which his choice ſo elected, afterwards purchaſed vnto him euer-liuing fame and glory, regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered by time in the braſſe-leaued booke of endleſſe perpetuitie.</p>
               <p>The Auncients alſo made and dedicated Images and Statues for the adoration and worſhip of Honor, which (as <hi>Alciatus</hi> giueth vs to vnderſtand) they fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med <note place="margin">Alciatus.</note> in the ſhape of a little child, clothed and apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a purple garment, hauing a garland of Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, wreathed about his head: with whome was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painted to hold hand in hand the god Cupid, who ſeemed to lead and guide the child vnto the goddeſſe Vertue, which was depictured right ouer againſt it, hewen forth and engraued with exquiſite and rare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliature.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8331:73"/>
Among the Auncients likewiſe was reuerenced and adored as a great goddeſſe, the Ladie <hi>Volupia,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Volupia</hi> the goddeſſe of pleaſures.</note> which they held to bee the goddeſſe of pleaſures and delights: and her Statue was depainted, as hauing a pallid and leane countenance, yet ſitting in a pontifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and maieſtike chaire, all embrodered and emboſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſtarres of refined gold. And vnder her feet was drawne out the picture of Vertue, looking as though ſhe had ben deiected, troden downe, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed by her.</p>
               <p>It is written with <hi>Plinie</hi> (as alſo <hi>Solinus</hi> and <hi>Macro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Plinie.</note> affirme the ſame) that in a certaine temple dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated vnto this goddeſſe <hi>Volupia,</hi> was cut out with egregious skill of the workeman (as ſitting vpon an Altar) the goddeſſe Angerona, looking with a heauie and ſad countenance, which alſo was framed with her lips tied together, and faſt conioined, to ſhew vs ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that in all pleaſures or other mattets whatſoeuer, it behoueth vs to hold our peace, &amp; to keepe ſilence. <hi>Macrobius</hi> expounds it thus, that whoſoeuer knoweth how to vſe ſecrecie, ſilence, and to diſſemble his greefes, and diſcontents, ſhall in the end ouercome them, and ſhall lead a moſt pleaſant, eaſefull, and qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et life.</p>
               <p>The Aegyptians did much reuerence and worſhip their god of Silence, which with them was called Harpocrates, and according to the Greekes, Sigaleon: whoſe Statue and Image (as <hi>Martianus</hi> and <hi>Apuleius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Martianus.</note> record) was made in the likeneſſe of a young child, who cloſe to his lips held one of his fingers, as a ſigne of ſecrecie. Whereupon it comes, that the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:8331:74"/>
faſhion is now alſo obſerued when men would ſignifie by ſigns, that a thing ſhould not be vnreuealed or ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of. Sometimes the portraiture of this God is drawne without any face at all, all couered ouer with the skin of a Wolfe, on which were depainted as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny eyes and eares as could bee inſerted thereon: ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying thereby, that it was needfull to ſee and heare much, and to ſpeak little, in that he that ſpeaketh not, offendeth not. By the Wolues skin is vnderſtood the propertie of that beaſt, who when it hath ſtolne anie prey, preſently conueyeth himſelfe away, and runneth with ſuch heed, feare, and quietneſſe, that hee dares not in all that time ſo much as drawe his breath, or pant, with ſuch ſlie ſecrecie doth he eſcape and ſteale away.</p>
               <p>But now it is time to returne to our firſt intreatie of Minerua, whom (as I haue alreadie ſaid) the Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents all armed, with a Speare or Dart in one hand, and a Chriſtall ſhield in the other. By the ſhield (in that Minerua is taken for Wiſdome and Knowledge) is vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the roundneſſe and compaſſe of the world, gouerned with wiſe decrees, politike lawes, &amp; diſcreet commandements. By the Dart or Speare, is vnſhado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed the force, vertue, and power of wiſdome, &amp; that the words and ſpeeches of a learned man do preuaile, and are effectual throughout the whole world: or that the ſharpeneſſe and vigour of an excellent wit, &amp; all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehending capacitie, is able to penetrate &amp; make entrance into the hardeſt and obſcureſt enigma what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer; as the Dart being furiouſly deliuered from the hands of a powerfull bodie, pierceth very deepe into
<pb facs="tcp:8331:74"/>
any hard ground or other mettall of good proofe or reſiſtance.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pauſanias</hi> writeth, that in a certain place of Greece was erected a moſt huge and great Coloſſus, out of which was cut forth and carued the picture of Miner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ua, ſitting as it were on a little ſtoole, &amp; drawing forth ſmall threds from a diſtaffe: for that the Ancients ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed her to bee the firſt inuentreſſe and deuiſer of ſpinning, as alſo of weauing in ſilke, and other like inuentions.</p>
               <p>They attribute alſo vnto her the firſt finding out of almoſt all kind of Arts and Sciences: vnderſtanding thereby, that the wit and inuention of man (for which Minerua, as I haue ſaid, is taken) is the beginner and diſcouerer of all ſorts of trades, faſhions, ſciences, or profeſſions whatſoeuer: touching which the Poets do faine, that Prometheus with the helpe of Minerua went vp to the higher heauens, and ſtealing away ſome part of the fierie chariot of the Sunne, gaue and beſtowed it on men below, whereby afterwards they contriued new arts, and mechanicall trickes of cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and skill, euery one after his owne maner, deuiſe, &amp; humor: in working of which arts (as <hi>Pliny</hi> writeth) is required two things, the firſt is Wit, and Conceit, and the other, Heed, Care, and true effecting of what is propoſed: the firſt is meant by Minerua, the laſt by Vulcan (which is as much to ſay as fire) for vnder the name of Vulcan, wee oftentimes read the nature of fire to bee vnderſtood, being the inſtrument and meanes to forme and faſhion almoſt all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8331:75"/>
Many writers haue deſcribed the portraitures of Vulcan and Minerua both in one Statue and Image, as <hi>Plato</hi> in one place ſayth, That theſe two were equallie ſuppoſed to bee the gods and protectors of Athens, <note place="margin">Plato.</note> for ſo much indeed as in thoſe times the ſtudie and practiſe of Sciences, was no leſſe vſed and followed than the profeſſion and inward exerciſes of letters and learning.</p>
               <p>Others write, that Neptune and Minerua were the ioint-protecters of Athens, ſo appointed by the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and decree of Iupiter, wherevpon the Athenians ſtamped and imprinted vpon their coine the picture of Neptunes Trident, and on the other ſide the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traiture of Minerua.</p>
               <p>But (as I ſaid before) Vulcan was many times vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood for fire, or at the leaſt for the force, propertie, and nature thereof, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> in many places allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth. <hi>Alexander Neapolitanus</hi> reporteth, that in one place of Aegypt was erected the Statue of Vulcan, <note place="margin">Alexander Neapolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> which held in one of his hands the true and liuely proportion of a certaine beaſt, which we call a Mole, and in his other hand a thunderbolt: and the Aegypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans ſo placed a Mole in his hand, for that they ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that Vulcan had ſent into one part of Aegypt infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite and vnſpeakeable numbers of Moles of purpoſe to eat, gnaw, and deſtroy the ſadles, bridles, targets, and ſuch like furniture made of Leather, belonging to the Arabians their enemies, who then were entred into their Countrie with huge armies of ſouldiours, to ouerrun and depopulate the Country, which not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding afterwards by the innumerable ſwarmes
<pb facs="tcp:8331:75"/>
as it were of theſe Moles, (ſo noiſome and offenſiue vnto them) were conſtrained to retire, leaue, &amp; aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the countrey: which thing is not altogether vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely, for ſo much as many autentike and approoued Authours haue verified the like.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Elianus</hi> reporteth, that the rootes of trees and <note place="margin">Elianus.</note> hearbes in certaine parts of Italie, were eaten and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in ſuch ſort with multitudes of Rats, that the inhabitants in the end (although they daily endeuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to kill them) were notwithſtanding for penurie, faine to leaue and forſake their Countrey. <hi>Marcus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Marcus Varro.</note> 
                  <hi>Varro</hi> writeth, That there was a Towne in Spain ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated on a ſandie ground, which was ſo vndermined by Connies, that in ſhort time it ſunke, and was vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly decaied. Neither haue theſe chances happened only in wild Countries and many continents, but in places alſo enuironned with the ſea, as that it is written, that one of the Iſles Cyclades, called Giare, was by the ouer-abundance and multitudes of Rats and Mice, left void and deſtitute of inhabitants, being ſo tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented and annoied with them, that very neceſſitie cauſed them to forgoe their Countrie. It is alſo repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that in Fraunce a very famous towne was by the ſaid vermine (ſo abounding therein) left void &amp; vnfre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented of any Inhabitants. The like chance alſo (as it is written) happened in a certaine country of Affri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca by the ſwarmes of Locuſts and Graſhoppers. <hi>Plinie</hi> reporteth, That in a certaine Prouince adioining to the confines of Aethiopia, Ants, and other ſmall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, exiled thence all the inhabitants thereabout. The people of Megaris in Greece, were conſtrained
<pb facs="tcp:8331:76"/>
by bees to leaue and forſake the countrey. Theophra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus ſpeaketh of another Countrey, which was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by Palmers, which are little wormes, long and rough, hauing many legs, and in Latine may be called <hi>Bruchi, Campe,</hi> or <hi>Multipede. Antenor</hi> writing alſo of the Iſle of Crete, ſayth, That a certaine multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Bees, chaſed out of a great Cittie all the inhabitants thereof, vſing their houſes in the ſtead of hiues.</p>
               <p>But returning to our former matter, which was, that the people of Aegypt verily beleeued, that thoſe Moles were ſent by Vulcan into their Countrey to deſtroy and driue away their enemies the Arabians, then entred into the land: It is crediblie written by <hi>Plutarch</hi> and others, that the people of Arabia do at <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> this time infinitely abhor &amp; hate thoſe kind of beaſts, and doe lay all plots and deuiſes to kill &amp; deſtroy them whereſoeuer they heare them to remaine, which kind of vermine alſo the Ethiopians, &amp; eſpecially the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iurers of Perſia hold an opinion to be very odious &amp; diſpleaſing to their gods. But it is not written, that the Aegyptians beleeued that Vulcan ſhould ſend them thoſe Moles, nor what reaſon moued them vnto that conceit in the embracing of ſuch opinion: but it is ſo recited as is before ſpoken of by that Author <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Neapolitanus,</hi> without any further explication of it. Although with ſome writers it is thus expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: By Vulcan (ſay they) is meant the drineſſe and extreame heat of that ſeaſon, which was ſummer: or elſe indeed the naturall drineſſe and warmth of that Countrey of Aethiopia. And <hi>Plinie</hi> writing of thoſe
<pb facs="tcp:8331:76"/>
vermine ſayth, they doe encreaſe and multiply in moſt aboundant manner, alwaies coueting thoſe places, which by the ardent furie of the ſunnes vertue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come drie, ſandie, and craſed, as likewiſe moſt of the countrey of Aethiopia is, and further expoſitions are not found to bee deliuered by anie Writers, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching that opinion and conceit of the Aegyptians.</p>
               <p>The opinions and writings which the Ancients haue made of Vulcan, remaine diuerſe &amp; many, and in that reſpect hee is ſhaped forth ſometimes in this forme, and ſometimes in another: with ſome hee is depictured, ſtanding, working, and hammering in a Smiths forge on the hill Etna in Sicilia, framing thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derbolts for Iupiter, and faſhioning arrowes for the god of loue and was taken to bee the rareſt workman that euer liued, vnto whome when the gods had anie occaſion to vſe ſuch maner of weapons, they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly repaired: as Thetis went vnto him to deſire him to forge an armor for her ſonne Achilles, and Venus for her ſonne Aeneas.</p>
               <p>Some depicture him lame of one leg, and of a very blacke and ſwart complexion, as one all ſmokie, &amp; of a general ill-ſhaped proportion of all his lineaments. It is not read, that vnto Vulcan were appropriated any beaſts, plants, or trees, as vnto all other of their gods, onely <hi>Elianus</hi> writeth, that the Egyptians conſecrated <note place="margin">Elianus.</note> vnto him the Lyons, in that thoſe beaſtes of all other are moſt hot, drie, &amp; fierie by nature, by which abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of heat within their bodies, it comes to paſſe, that they doe ſo exceedingly feare and are aſtonied at the ſight of fire, which they can by no meanes indure,
<pb facs="tcp:8331:77"/>
but run from it with great affrightment. It is read alſo, that on the hill Mongibell in Sicillia there are certain great dogs, which do there guard and keepe the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Vulcan, which is ſeated hard by a woods ſide, adioyning to that Mountaine, and the people therea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts doe worſhip and adore Vulcan in that Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and in thoſe conſecrated woods and buſhes.</p>
               <p>It is written by the Poets, that Vulcan was the husband of Venus, as lawfully married vnto her, and that they are alwaies depictured together, as accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying one the other. By which is vnderſtood, that the generation and birth of creatures (meant by Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus) cannot bee effectuall without a moderate heat &amp; warmeneſſe (which is alſo vnderſtood by Vulcan.) Some alſo doe adioine Mars as the companion to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, meaning by him the heat of the Sunne, wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Alcitans (people inhabiting the furthermoſt parts of Spaine, as <hi>Macrobius</hi> reporteth) made the Statue and Image of Mars, ſo adorned and beautified with the beames of the ſunne, in as liuely manner as could bee deuiſed; which picture was there reueren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with wondrous zeale and adoration. <hi>Macrobius</hi> alſo ſayth, That the gods (being the ſubſtance of the celeſtiall fire) were onely different in name, and not otherwiſe: and that Mars was generally taken for that heat and warmeneſſe which proceeded from the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Sun. By reaſon whereof, the liuely heat and bloud which is within vs, is eaſily ſet on fire &amp; enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with anger, furie, and deſire of warre: of which things Mars alſo is held and ſuppoſed to bee the god. And after that faſhion the Auncients worſhipped &amp;
<pb facs="tcp:8331:77"/>
adored him, dedicating vnto him many ſumptuous Statues, Images, and Pictures, and they ſhaped him of aſpect, moſt fierce, terrible, and wrathfull, with hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low red eyes, very ſpeedie and quicke in their reuolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, his face all hairie, with long curled lockes on his head, depending euen to his ſhoulders, of a coale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blacke colour, he ſtood all armed throughout, with a ſpeare in one hand, and in the other a whip, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they depicture him riding on a horſe, ſometimes drawne in a chariot, whoſe horſes were called Feare and Horror: And ſome other ſay, that his chariot was drawne with two men, which alwaies accompanied him whereſoeuer he went, and they were called Furie &amp; Violence. The which thing <hi>Statius</hi> imitateth when <note place="margin">Statius.</note> he ſayth. That Iupiter ſent for Mars, and commanded him to raiſe and ſtirre vp bloudie warres and quarrels between the Argiues and Thebans. And in this place <hi>Statius</hi> deſcribeth the armes of this god to bee theſe: He wore (ſayth hee) on his head a helmet moſt bright and ſhining, and of ſo fierie a hue and gliſter, as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med there iſſued out of it great flaſhes of lightning, his breaſtplate was of ſolid gold, reflecting with a moſt glorious and eye-delighting luſtre, and there was inſculpt thereon many figures and ſhapes of moſt fierce and vgly monſters, his ſhield was depainted all ouer with a red or bloudie colour, inchaſed alſo with moſt ſtrange-ſhaped and deformed beaſtes, cut out and engrauen with rare inuention, &amp; puritie of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, excelling in the topiarie art. And thus hee rode with aſpeare and ſcourge in either of his hands, in a moſt coſtly and gold-emboſſed Charriot,
<pb facs="tcp:8331:78"/>
whoſe horſes (called Furie and Violence) were guided by the two churliſh coachmen, Wrath and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: directly before this chariot was depainted the portraiture of Fame, ſtretching abroad her wings, &amp; ſeeming to proffer a flight, which at the firſt view, ſeemed to mount, and afterward to roue abroad, and ſearch into all corners of the earth, and this picture appeared (a little off from it) to be very ſmal, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming neere vnto it, it was of a great bigneſſe, which workemanſhip was performed with great cunning and preciſe curiouſneſſe of art. The Auncients alſo pictured this Fame in the forme of a woman, apparel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with a thin and ſleightly-wouen mantle of purple ſilke, which was cloſe girted about her bodie, that ſhe might with more ſwiftneſſe runne and ſcour through the Countries of the world, in both her hands ſhee ſeemed to hold a crooked ſhell, long and hollow like to an inſtrument, which wee call a Cornet, which ſhe held to her mouth. With ſome ſhe is depainted with two wings on her ſhoulders, and her face beſet full of eyes, and ouer all her bodie were infinite numbers of eares, and tongues liuely ſet forth and depictured, as <hi>Virgil</hi> moſt excellently hath deliuered, who alſo ſayth, <note place="margin">Virgil.</note> that ſhee flieth alwaies in the night without taking ſleepe or repoſe at any time, and that ſhee commonly ſeateth her ſelfe on the top of a high turret, where ſhe vttereth and babbleth foorth all that either her eyes haue ſeene, or her eares haue heard, being indeed ſo many, that nothing can eſcape them, whereby ſhee was entearmed the tatling Ladie, &amp; miſtreſſe of news. But touching the former deſcriptions of Mars: It is
<pb facs="tcp:8331:78"/>
written with ſome, that ſuch his glorious and ſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous chariot whereon hee vſed to ride in the wanres, was commonly drawne with foure mightie ſtrong horſes, which were ſo furious, hot, and prowd, that euen very fierie ſparkles ſeemed to iſſue forth fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> their noſthrils <hi>Iſiodorus</hi> ſayth, That the picture of Mars was <note place="margin">Iſiodorus.</note> oftentimes ſet forth and depainted, with the breaſt of it all naked and vnclothed, to vnſhadow thereby, that in the warres and chaunces of danger, men ought not to be timorous, but ſhould expoſe themſelues to all hazardous and vncertaine aduentures whatſoeuer. <hi>Herodotus</hi> writeth, that the people of Scithia hung vp <note place="margin">Herodotus.</note> a ſword in the middle of a temple, and worſhipped it as the Image of Mars, as people ignorant, how to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the god of warre otherwiſe. <hi>Statius</hi> deſcribing <note place="margin">Statius,</note> the houſe of Mars ſayth, That it is built in an obſcure corner of Thracia, where the people wholly giue and addict themſelues to warres and ſtratagemicall poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and that it was wholly made and compoſed of yron, all ruſtie, blacke, and foule, and that the porters there which kept the gates, were called Horror and Madneſſe, within the houſe inhabited Furie, Wrath, Impietie, Feare, Treaſon, and Violence, of all which, the gouerneſſe and commandreſſe was Diſcord, who there was ſeated in a regall and princely throne, hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in one of her hands a bright ſhining ſword, and in her other a great yron baſen full of humane bloud. Of this Diſcord it is written, that ſhee was the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw and ruine of that famous towne of Phrygia in Aſia Minor, called Troy, &amp; the reaſon (as ſome write) was, in that ſhee was not inuited to a certaine great

feaſt made on the Mountain Pelion by Iupiter for the ſolemnizing and celebrating of the nuptials between Peleus and Thetis, where almoſt all gods and goddeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes whatſoeuer, were conuented; and where alſo ſhee appeared, but notwithſtanding was commaunded by Iupiter to depart from that marriage, and not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bee at the ſolemnization thereof: and this great meeting was not ten daies before the contention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the three goddeſſes for the golden ball, ended and decided by Paris, which prooued the deſtruction of all the houſe of Priamus, and flaughter of the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians; for of this marriage was begotten that euer-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med knight Achilles: but as I told you, becauſe Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord could not be admitted to this feaſt, prepared on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for merrie, pleaſant, and for familiar agreements, ſhe afterward raiſed ſuch miſcheeuous occaſion, and ſo laboured day and night in her diuelliſh plots, that by her meanes grew that long-continuing warre and enmitie betweene the Phrygians and Pelaſgians, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted, maintained, and ended, by the proweſſe of this new-borne child Achilles. <hi>Virgil</hi> ſayth, That this Diſcord was by many writers framed and ſet forth in the likeneſſe of one of the furies of hell: as likewiſe <hi>Petronius</hi> and <hi>Aristides</hi> affirme, ſaying, That ſhee hath the aſpect and looke of an infernall hag, with hollow <note place="margin">Petronius.</note> and bleared eyes, far ſunke into her head, from which euermore diſtilled downe many watrie drops, her lips are pale and drie, her teeth all furd with lothſome corruption, her breath all-infected, ill-ſauoured, and thicke, her cheekes diſcoloured, wan, and thin, &amp; that ſhee ſtretched forth her long &amp; leane hands, as readie
<pb facs="tcp:8331:79"/>
to catch and take hold of any occaſion profered, in her breaſt ſhe carried a naked knife with a ſharp point, her legs were wondrous crooked, and little, as ſcarce able to ſupport the burthen of her withered bodie, for her garment ſhe wore a mantle made of black rug; and thus <hi>Petronius</hi> deſcribes her leaning vpon a ſtaffe. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> writeth, that in a lid of a cheſt giuen to Cip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelus, was engraued &amp; carued the combat of Aiax and Hector, performed in the preſence of Diſcord, which (ſayth hee) was an old and hard-fauoured woman.</p>

Not farre from her ſat Death, with a bloudie and ſtearne countenance, whoſe face was ouerwaſht with bloud, and hackt with many and cruell ſlaſhes, where vpon a ſtately altar, he was offering ſacrifices in goblets made
<pb facs="tcp:8331:80"/>
with the skuls of men, and filled vp euen to the brim with humane bloud; which oblation was conſecrated to god Mars, with coales of fire (which ſet on flame the ſacrifice) fetcht from many Citties, Townes, and Holds, burnt and ruinated by tyrannie of the Warres: round about the Court were hanged vp (as pictures to beautifie the ſame) many famous ſpoiles and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enſigns of victorie, brought from all the parts &amp; corners of the world: In his bed chamber were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painted forth with wondrous curious workmanſhip, fatall maſſacres, burning of townes, diſmall ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men, caſtles won by treaſon, murther, and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanie, with many ſuch like all in row conioined and ſet together.</p>
               <p>Vnto Mars was conſecrated by the Auncients, as gratefull vnto him, a Cocke, either to ſhew thereby the vigilancie and carefull watch which ſhould bee in ſouldiours, or elſe (as <hi>Lucianus</hi> writeth) becauſe that Alectrio (a ſouldiour entirely beloued and endeared of Mars) was by the gods transformed and chaunged into this bird. Some alſo haue appropriated vnto him the wolfe, being a moſt rauenous &amp; deuouring beaſt, and therefore attributed vnto him; in that all ſouldiers and men of warre, vpon their firſt furie and heate are giuen much to ſpoiling and conſuming of goods, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inating and ouerthrowing all things whatſoeuer, that happen vnto them in the pride of their choler, &amp; firſt inflamation of their bloud: or elſe becauſe this beaſt (as I haue in other places remembred) ſeeth moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly in the darkeſt night, as wiſe and prouident cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and commaunders ought to doe, that is, that
<pb facs="tcp:8331:80"/>
they with an all-foreſeeing aduiſedneſſe and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection, preuent and fruſtrate the ſecret, darke, and hidden plots, and cloſe-contriued ſtratagemes of the enemie whatſoeuer, for by the ſharpe-ſighted eyes of this beaſt is vnderſtood the farre-reaching capacitie and wittie braine of a politicke commaunder, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couering and ſeeing through the ſecret and concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led intendemennts of his aduerſarie. And thus much ſhall ſuffice for the natures and properties of Mars, impoſing alſo an end to the Statues, Images, and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures dedicated, erected, and conſecrated to him, as alſo to Minerua, ſo taken by the Auncients to bee the goddeſſe of Wiſedome, Learning, and of Wars.</p>

               <p>HIſtories doe deliuer vnto vs, that this Bacchus (of whome wee now entreat) was held among the Auncients in great repute and eſteeme for a moſt valerous, hardie, and well-approued Captaine, performing in thoſe his times many worthie, haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and gallant ſeruices, which gained vnto him the report and title of a victorious and all-conquering commander: as <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> and many other au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentike Authours haue written. But in the end, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in regard of ſuch his valiancie, or other perticu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar propertie and knowledge, he was amongſt others of their ſuperſticious errors, cannonized &amp; worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as a god, dedicating temples, and erecting Altars and Statues vnto him: among whome alſo hee was knowne and called by diuerſe and ſeuerall names, as
<pb facs="tcp:8331:81"/>
ſometimes Bacchus, ſometimes Dioniſius, &amp; at other times <hi>Liber pater,</hi> &amp; many other, and by reaſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was ſometimes depictured in this form, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in that ſhape, according to the ſeuerall opinion of the people with whome hee was ſo worſhipped. <hi>Philostratus</hi> ſayth, That his Statue was framed in the likeneſſe of a young man without a beard, of a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulent &amp; groſſe bodie, his face of a high colour, and very big, and about his head was wreathed a garland of yuie leaues, from his temples ſeemed to peepe forth two ſmall hornes, and cloſe by his ſide lay a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine beaſt, called a Panther. The which deſcription made by <hi>Philoſtratus,</hi> is in ſome ſort drawne from the <note place="margin">Philoſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> nature and qualitie of Wine, of which indeed, the Poets faine that Bacchus is the god, for ſo much as he (as it is written) was the firſt that euer found out the commoditie thereof, and diſcouered vnto men (then abiding in ignorance thereof) the manner of gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring grapes from the vinetree, and to preſſe and bruſe them together, of whoſe iuice and licour afterwards Wine was made. But ſome affirme, that Icarus the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Erigonus, firſt inuented the making of Wine, and that it was firſt of all drunke in Athens, where he himſelfe being drunke with the force thereof, was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerably ſlaine by the people. And it is alſo written that in Italy Saturne was the firſt that euer inſtructed them in the true vſe of the grape, which hee before had pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed and learned in Crete. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſayth, That in France one Arras an Etruſcian was the firſt that cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it to bee vſed. But concerning the truth of the firſt inuention thereof, it is infallibly certaine, that it was
<pb facs="tcp:8331:81"/>
found out by <hi>Noe,</hi> which <hi>Lactantius</hi> and <hi>Ioſephus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, beſides, that place alſo in the nineteenth of Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis approoues it, which is ſufficient warrant againſt all allegations whatſoeuer. <hi>Iaques de Bergamus</hi> in his <note place="margin">Iaques de Bergamus.</note> ſecond booke of the Chronicles of the world, ſayth, That <hi>Noe</hi> by this meanes found out the nature of the grape: <hi>Noe</hi> (ſayth hee) on a certaine day viewing and marking the feeding of beaſts on a mountaine of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menia called Coricus, among the reſt eſpied a young bul brouſing on the berries of a wild vine, of which he had not long fed, but that hee became exceeding wild, furious, and mad. <hi>Noe</hi> wondring at the force and effect of thoſe berries, planted them afterwards on better grafts, and ſo had the experiment and triall of the vertue and propertie of them, of which preſently after hee cauſed Wine to be made, and for that cauſe, was among the Scythians called Ianus, which ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in that language, the giuer of Wine.</p>
               <p>But proceeding with the depicturances of Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, <hi>Claudianus</hi> ſayth, that his Image or Statue is made and ſet forth (as it were) all naked and without clothes, meaning thereby, that the furie and working power of wine ouer-abundantly taken, cauſeth a man to diſcouer, lay open, and (as it were) make naked, anie ſeceret or concealed thing whatſoeuer, which before that time with neuer ſo much labour, induſtrie, and care, was kept priuate, cloſe, and vnreuealed: with ſome Bacchus is depictured in the ſimilitude of a very aged man, anatomiſing and vnſhadowing thereby, that the exceſſe taking of wine, haſteneth on, and is the cauſe of the ſudaine and vntimely approch of old

age, as debillitating and eneruating the contexed ground of our ſences and ſinnewes, with the ſucking vp and drying of the humiditie and naturall moiſture of youth-maintaining humours: for ſo much as it is manifeſt, that the vnexpected failing, and weakeneſſe of our ſences, (by that meanes admitting a more fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble eſtate of our bodies) being old age, is nothing elſe but the abſence and vtter decay of a naturall moiſtnes within vs, and a generall ſiccitude throughout the whole compoſition of our bodies; which wee ſeeking to recouer and re-poſſeſſe, accept no meanes ſo fit, nor thinke any preſcription ſo auaileable, as the vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all drinking of wine, wherein indeed men are infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceaued, and inuelloped (as it were) with clouds and miſts of blindneſſe, and of error: for ſo much as though wine bee in the firſt taſt and receit thereof in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our bodies, ſomething moiſt and engendring rume and raw humours, yet it is in the operatiue vertue and power ſo maruellous hot and fierie, that it drieth vp, and concocteth all the moiſtneſſe and humiditie whatſoeuer, before ingendered and bred: for <hi>Galen</hi> (that euer-famous Doctor) ſayth, That the greateſt <note place="margin">Galen.</note> drinkers of Wine, the more they drink, the more drie and thirſtie doe they find themſelues, &amp; by how much the more they thinke and doe beleeue to quench and allay their thirſt by drinking more Wine, ſo much doe they encreaſe and augment their drineſſe and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire thereof.</p>
               <p>Not much vnlike that former deſcription of Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, was that depicturance which wee read to bee made of one Comus, held and reputed among the
<pb facs="tcp:8331:82"/>
Auncients to bee the god of Feaſts, Banquets, and mirth-miniſtring co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>uenticles: whoſe Statue or Image was likewiſe drawne forth and framed in the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance and likeneſſe of a very young man, whoſe face ſeemed to thruſt out a few ſmall haires, his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance pleaſant, gracious, and ſmiling, and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion rubicund and high coloured. And <hi>Philoſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> deſcribes him ſtanding at the dore of agreat cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber full of gueſts, inuited to a moſt ſumptuous ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet, wherein was much drinking and feaſting, with great exceſſe, and too much ſuperfluitie, as ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and celebrating the eſpouſals of a new-married virgine: and ſayth, that hee ſtood there leaning on a ſtaffe, with his eies halfe ſhut, and halfe open, ſo that by little and little his head declined towards his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, and his boſome towards his arme, then reſting on the ſtaffe, which was indeed verie vncertainly pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: and thus betweene falling, and a weake ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of himſelfe, hee reelingly wauered and mooued to and fro: about his head (ſayth hee) was wreathed a garland of ſmeet-ſmelling flowers, and alſo ouer moſt part of his bodie, at the one ſide of him was placed a great goblet of wine, and hard by that a muſicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument like to a Cymball: the flowers ſo redemiting his temples, ſignifie ioy, mirth, and pleaſance, and the inſtrument the lightneſſe of heart, and contempt of ſadneſſe and melancholike cogitations: his pleaſant, freſh, and liuely countenance ſhewes, that by the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and ſtirring vertue of wine, mens ſpirits are awaked and made ioifull, as without doubt a moderat and temperate receit thereof, quickeneth &amp; reuiueth
<pb facs="tcp:8331:83"/>
drouſie and drooping ſences, infuſing into their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits a more loftie and aſpiring thought. <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth, <note place="margin">Plinie.</note> that diſcreet taking of wine, encreaſeth &amp; contexeth a mans forces and ſinewes, purifies the bloud from coniealed corruption, ſharpens the ſight, comforteth the ſtomach, procureth appetite, prouoketh vrine, nouriſheth ſleepe, forceth vomites, purgeth melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholie, expelleth ſorrowfulneſſe of heart, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, exceedingly reioiceth and dooth letificate the ſpirits of men. <hi>Plato</hi> ſayth, That as raine temperately affoorded, nutrifieth and giueth encreaſe to all kind <note place="margin">Plato.</note> of herbage whatſoeuer, and that ouer-much abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance thereof, and extraordinarie inundations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyeth, drowneth, and ſpoileth them: euen ſo wine taken with moderation, and diſcreetly, comforteth the heart and ſpirits, whereas ouermuch vſed, it ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, inflameth, and conſumeth it: <hi>Apuleius Paniaſis</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Apuleius Paniaſis.</note> (that writ of the diuers operations of meats) ſayth, That one cup of wine a man may drinke after meales with health, and the preſeruatiue meanes thereof, but the ſecond quickeneth and prouoketh venerous luſts, and the third bringeth ſhame, diſhonour, &amp; infamie. The Grecians neuer put any water into wine, but cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a little wine to bee medled with a great quantitie of water, <hi>Heſiodus</hi> commandeth, that one cup of wine bee intermingled with three of water. The auncient Romanes abſolutely forbad the vſe of Wine to anie women or children, as <hi>Valerius</hi> reporteth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plinie</hi> writeth, That wine was ſo highly forbidden in Rome, and with ſuch ſeuere penalties impoſed on <note place="margin">Plinie.</note> the breakers of ſuch law, that on a time a certaine
<pb facs="tcp:8331:83"/>
maid hauing ſtolen the keyes of her maiſters wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller, priuily to haue drunke and taſted thereof, (or perhaps a deſire onely to infringe the commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, according to the humours of many of that ſex) was for the ſame (without anie further intent therein meant by her) adiudged by famine to looſe her life, and that alſo not without the conſent and well-liking of many of her friends, kinsfolkes, and parents.</p>
               <p>It is written of Romulus, that when hee had made any great feaſt or banquet, and inuited many gueſts therevnto, would haue great plentie of wine at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but would neuer himſelfe ſo much as taſt thereof, ſaying, that to morrow he was to determine of weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie affaires.</p>
               <p>It is read, that Iulius Caeſar neuer drunke wine: and yet that famous Alexander, that true ſubiect of wars<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hyſtorians, almoſt neuer abſtained it, but in the end it ouerthrew him, and depriued him of further vſe thereof.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anachraſes</hi> ſayth, That Wine preſenteth vnto <note place="margin">Anachraſes.</note> vs three grapes, the firſt of pleaſure, the ſecond of drunkenneſſe, and the laſt of teares, ſorrow, and diſgrace.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> ſayth, That Bacchus was depi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured among the Grecians in two ſeuerall formes, the one of a verie aged man with a very long beard, growing ſtiffe and thicke, the other of youthful years, of a pleaſant and amorous aſpect: by the firſt is vnfol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the nature of wine, being immeaſureablie taken, which maketh men looke furious, wild, and of a ſterne countenance, and by the ſecond (as when wine is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
<pb facs="tcp:8331:84"/>
and temperately taken) is meant, that it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth men pleaſant, diſcourſiue, and full of merry pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimes. <hi>Macrobius,</hi> who (as I haue alreadie many times <note place="margin">Macrobius.</note> remembred) alwaies vnderſtood by the nature of ſuch their gods, the ſeuerall properties and vertues of the Sunne, ſayth, That Bacchus was framed ſometimes in the likeneſſe of a young child, ſometimes of a youth, ſometimes at the full age and growth of a man, and ſometimes in the forme of one very aged and decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit, with a long white beard, to ſignifie that all theſe ſeuerall ages and encreaſes are ſeene to bee in the ſun, for in the time of the winter Solſtitium, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the daies doe then newly begin to lengthen and grow longer, it may bee ſaid, that hee is then a young child, dailie encreaſing and growing. And that at the Equinoctiall of the Spring hee hath attained to the yeares of ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſcencie, and may bee called a young man. Then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards at the Solſtitium of the Summer, when daies are fully at the longeſt, and can lengthen no more, hee is ſaid to be at the eſtate of entire virilitie and manlie growth, and hath then a full beard, without further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing or growing. But becauſe after that time the daies begin againe to ſhorten, by reaſon of the ſunnes withdrawing himſelfe from our horiſon, and obſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his bright irradiance and glorie from the world, he may be called an oldman, as ſhortening and leſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his daies declining and drawing to an abſolute obſcuritie and departure from this life, and thus <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crobius</hi> hath expounded his application.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> deſcribeth Bacchus with two hornes on his head, which (ſayth <hi>Macrobius)</hi> ſignifie <note place="margin">Diodorus Siculus.</note>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8331:84"/>
the raies and beames of the ſun, but <hi>Diodorus</hi> ſayth, That by them rather is vnſhadowed and intended, that Bacchus was the firſt that inſtructed and taught men how to till their grounds, by ſubiugating and coupling their Oxen for the performance thereof. Some writers vnderſtand by thoſe hornes ſo infixed on Bacchus, audacitie, impudencie, boldneſſe, and fierceneſſe, approoued by the ouermuch taking of wine, which makes men hardie and aduenturous, as alſo impudent and ſhameleſſe, as is generally affirmed by <hi>Philoſtratus, Feſtus Pompeius, Porphirio, Perſius,</hi> and others that haue writ thereof. <hi>Muſonius</hi> a Greeke wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <note place="margin">Muſonius.</note> ſayth, That vnto Bacchus were not onely hornes giuen, but that hee was of many Poets deſcribed and defigured in the ſhape and likeneſſe of a bull, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was, for that (as Poets deliuer) Ioue (transformed into a ſerpent) lay carnally with his owne daughter Proſerpina, the which by him being great, brought forth Bacchus in the forme of a young bull, wherevp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Cizenians (people inhabiting the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of Perſia) his Image and Picture was fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to the true ſimilitude and likeneſſe of a bull. But <hi>Theopompus</hi> and other writers ſay, that they gaue thoſe hornes ſo vnto Bacchus, in that in Epirus and <note place="margin">Theopom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.</note> many places thereabouts, were buls of that hugenes and mightie bodies, that with their hornes (being an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable alſo in bigneſſe) the people there made them their great veſſels to drinke in, which there was a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall cup or veſſell throughout all thoſe Countries thereabouts, and which faſhion alſo ſpread it ſelfe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards into many other Countries round about
<pb facs="tcp:8331:85"/>
them, among which they alwaies vſed and accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to drinke out of hornes. The Athenians after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward taking hold of that cuſtome and manner, fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their ſiluer veſſels and bowles wherein they vſed to drinke, in the faſhion and proportion of crooked and retorted hornes.</p>
               <p>But it is vnderſtood with ſome, that ſuch hornes on Bacchus, ſignified certaine few haires, which from either ſide of the head were left growing in thoſe daies, which likewiſe now at this time the Prieſts and holy men of Armenia (and in many places of India) doe vſe to weare, and obſerue, which doe ſhaue all the vpper part and top of their heads, and alſo behind in their neckes, (reſeruing onely two mightie long lockes, growing on either ſide before, towards their temples) which they vſed to bind with a fillet or lace very hard, and ſo made them to ſtand of themſelues erect and out right. For which cauſe and faſhion alſo <hi>Moſes</hi> was ſaid among the Hebrewes to haue had hornes, and ſo was King <hi>Liſimachus</hi> with the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> writeth, That Bacchus was oftentimes depictured and drawne forth in his Statues and Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, clothed with womens garments, and in effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate habite, when hee reporteth, that hee went in ſuch manner apparrelled, with a long purple robe, beautifully ſet forth and adorned with tires of ſilke, vnto his loue Ariadne, and that then he wore on his head a coronet of roſes, curiouſly compoſed &amp; made, his companions and followers alſo were all in like wanton and looſe abillements, faſhioning themſelues
<pb facs="tcp:8331:85"/>
ſome like rurall Nimphs, as the Driades, Oriades, and ſuch like; ſome like the ſea Nimphs, as the Nereides, Syrens, and others; and ſome alſo in the ſhape of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires, Faunes, and Siluans, and all theſe attended him, going to his amorous delights, and ſports with Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adne. The clothes and garments of women, ſo ſaid to bee on Bacchus, ſignifie, that the inordinate taking of wine weakeneth and debillitateth the naturall forces and powers of a man, making him feeble, vnconſtant, and ſtrengthleſſe, like a woman: or that (as ſome hold) he was ſo depictured, becauſe on certaine daies of the yeare hee accuſtomed ſo to habite himſelfe, when thoſe great feaſts, which were called Bacchana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, were ſolemniſed and kept, at which almoſt all the women thereabout would meet, drinking and carou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in that abundance and immoderate exceſſe, as they would become with the force thereof euen fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly mad, braineſicke, and wild, with dauncing and leaping, ſinging loud canticles, beating one another, running among the woods, vallies, and mountaines, and vſing all ſtrange and rude geſtures, and behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, worſe than people extreamely mad and luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tike.

                  <hi>Pauſanias</hi> writeth, that among the Eleans the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of Bacchus was there cut out, as hauing a long <note place="margin">Pauſanias.</note> beard, with a garment or gowne couering all his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die euen to the feet, and that hee held in one hand a hooke or ſharpe ſythe, and in the other a goblet or
<pb facs="tcp:8331:86"/>
bowle of wine, and round about him were depainted forth many vinetrees, and other fruitfull and commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious plants. And with ſome hee was called Bacchus Baſſareus, by reaſon of that long garment which vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hee wore, and which was called Baſſara, ſo named of a certain place in Lidia, where thoſe kind of cloths were made, or els it was ſo called of the skinnes of wolues, which thoſe women in their Bacchinall feaſts vſed to weare about their ſhoulders, for that in the Thracian language a wolfe is called Baſſara. Neither did thoſe women vſe onely the skins of Wolues, but of Panthers and Tygres alſo, which they careleſly wold hang about their ſhoulders in their fits of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſſe and furie, tearing vp the graſſe and hearbes with their nailes as they went along, their haire han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ouer their faces, which they ſet forth with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe and ſundrie-coloured flowers; ouer one of their armes they wore a garland made of yuie leaues, or the white Poppie, for that this Poppie was ſuppoſed to be an infernall flower, and growing on the banckes of Acheron, and therefore the Ancients appropriated it vnto the companions and followers of Bacchus, for that among ſome he was held alſo and taken to be the god of the infernall region, whereupon (as I haue al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready very lately deliuered) the Poets doe affirme that hee was borne of Proſerpina, which was Queene of the lower kingdome, wife to Pluto, and daughter to Iupiter and Ceres.</p>
               <p>It is written with <hi>Diodorus Siculus,</hi> that Bacchus was not alwaies conuerſant and merrie in drinking <note place="margin">Diodoros Siculus,</note> and in feaſts, but ſayth, that hee ſhewed himſelfe in
<pb facs="tcp:8331:86"/>
many ſeruices a very valerous &amp; couragious captaine, and followed the warres with great fortunes manie yeares together, in which time, he would commonlie weare for his vpper garment the skinnes of Panthers, and ſuch like beaſts. He victoriouſly ouercame in bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell (ſayth <hi>Diodorus)</hi> many kings and great comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as <hi>Licurgus Pentheus,</hi> and others, and alſo ſubiu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and reduced vnto his commaund all the hether India, returning from thence with mightie triumph and victorie, carried on the backe of a huge Elephant, with all his whole armie celebrating and extolling the praiſes and worthy exploits of their lord &amp; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander. Neither is it read, that before his time there was euer any king or Prefect that euer triumphed in the warres, or was led home with ſuch ceremonious ſignes and teſtimonies of victorious preuailement ouer his enemies. And therefore vnto Bacchus, as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the firſt triumpher, was conſecrated the bird Pica, being a bird full of prattle, and apt to ſpeake any fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar language, for that in thoſe triumphs it was law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for any one to reprooue anothers vices with any diſpightfull tearmes, or diſgrace whatſoeuer, euerie one crying out, and obiecting what might bee ſaid to the defence or deniall thereof.</p>
               <p>The Auncients alſo haue attributed vnto this god the firſt innention and making of garlands, who alſo was the firſt that did weare any, and for himſelfe hee made them of yuie leaues, which afterwards was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated alſo vnto him: whereupon <hi>Alexander</hi> the great minding to imitate him therein, cauſed all his armie in his returne from the conqueſt of India, to
<pb facs="tcp:8331:87"/>
make them garlands and wreaths thereof. This plant or tree was for diuerſe reaſons attributed vnto Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus. <hi>Plutarch</hi> ſayth, That it hath in it ſelfe ſuch a hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> and ſecret power and vertue, that being applied in a certaine faſhion, obſerued by the Phyſicians, it cauſeth men without either beere or wine to bee ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding drunke and giddie in the braines. <hi>Eustathius</hi> writeth, That yuie according to the Greeke word <note place="margin">Euſtathius.</note> thereof, which is <hi>Liſso,</hi> ſignifieth luſt, or deſire of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall voluptuouſneſſe, and in that reſpect was giuen vnto Bacchus, for that men being drunke and ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with the braine-diſtempering furie thereof, are ſooner drawne and enclined to thoſe deſires, than at other times.</p>
               <p>The Statues of Bacchus alſo was ſometimes (as ſome writers report) ſet forth and adorned with coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets made of the leaues of a Fig tree, in memorie (as ſome hold) of a Nimph which was called <hi>Syca,</hi> which word with the Greekes ſignifieth as much as <hi>Fico</hi> in Italian: which Nimph was entirely beloued of Bac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, and metamorphiſed by the gods into that plant. As it is read alſo of <hi>Staphilis,</hi> a Nimph on whome Bacchus was likewiſe exceedingly enamoured, and who afterwards was transformed into a vine tree: ſo that it ſhould ſeeme from thence it comes, that theſe plants are ſo pleaſing &amp; grateful vnto Bacchus. With ſome alſo hee is crowned with the leaues of the flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer Narciſſus, and many other fragrant and ſweet-ſmelling flowers. Wherevpon <hi>Statius</hi> ſayth, That his Chariot wherein hee was vſed to bee drawne, was all adorned and beautified with flowers, hearbes, and
<pb facs="tcp:8331:87"/>
young plants. <hi>Boccace</hi> (by the Charriot which is ſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto him) expoundeth, that by the extream taking of Wine, mens heads, and alſo their bodies goe tum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and reeling vp and downe like the wheeles of a charriot: which ſayth hee) being drawne with Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and Tygres, ſignifieth, that the working power of Wine maketh men ſeeme furious, cruell, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible in their lookes, and wild behauiours, according to the qualities of thoſe beaſts ſo appropriated vnto him. <hi>Philoſtratus</hi> ſayth, That thoſe Panthers are ſo gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen <note place="margin">Philoſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus.</note> vnto Bacchus, for that they are of amoſt hot and drie conſtitution, (as commonly the drinkers of wine are) and that they are light and ſpeedie either in lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping or running, as men likewiſe find them more nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and light when they are drunke and haue ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ouergone themſelues in too much wine, than they doe at any other time. The ſame Authour alſo ſayth (in a certaine place where hee depainteth the ſhip of Bacchus) that the prow or forepart therof was framed in the likeneſſe and proportion of a Panther, round abound which were Cymbals and Shalmes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painted, and plaied vpon by many young men: in the midſt of the ſhip was placed a long and ſtreight tree, on the top of which were hung purple garments, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen with pure gold of Triolus, which the frantike wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Bacchinall feaſts vſed to weare, which alſo were depictured there with rare perfection of true cunning and workemanſhip: on both ſides of the ſhip were ſet forth with great life many yuie trees full of berries, as alſo many vines, whoſe verie braunches with plentie of fruit, ſeemed to craſe and breake off
<pb facs="tcp:8331:88"/>
from the ſtocke, whoſe greene leaues and new ripened grapes were depainted forth with vnſpeakeable curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and labour. Towards the bottome of the ſhip was hewen and cut out a moſt liuely and perfect foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, flowing and ſtreaming with pure Wine, whoſe ſweetneſſe certaine men (moſt exactly drawne forth vnderneath it) ſeemed to taſt, and eagerly receaue, wherein was diſcouered by admirable skill of the workeman, a moſt liuely repreſentation of an excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thirſt and deſire of drinke: and thus <hi>Phtloſtratus</hi> deſcribeth the ſhip of Bacchus, whoſe verie like by all deſcriptions and particular reſemblances, was long time kept and preſerued in Rome, in the temple there called <hi>La chieſa di Santa Agneſe,</hi> and afterward called the temple of Bacchus.</p>
               <p>It is written of Bacchus by ancient Authours, that when hee was a young child, the three fatall ſiſters compaſſed him about as he lay in his cradle, and caſt ouer his face two moſt venomous and vgly ſerpents, which as hiſtories mention, neuer offended him: from whence it afterwards grew, that the bacchinall wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in celebrating their rites and ceremonies, vſed to eat and deuour young Snakes. And <hi>Catullus</hi> ſayth, that thoſe frantike women in performing and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <note place="margin">Catullus.</note> the ceremonious obſeruances of their feaſt, vſed to carrie in one of their hands ſome member &amp; part of a young heyfar, all mingled and cut in peeces: and the reaſon was for that (as it is read) <hi>Pantheus</hi> king of Thebes (being a great enemie to all thoſe cuſtomes and faſhions) deſpiſed and ſet at nought all ſuch ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſo dedicated vnto Bacchus, neither would hee
<pb facs="tcp:8331:88"/>
admit by any meanes any ſuch ceremonie to bee per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed within his rule and gouernement, who to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate the more from Bacchus, and diſgrace his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruances, one day as they were buſily employed in great reuerence and zeale amidſt their cheefeſt obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, cauſed a mad heyfar (or as <hi>Ouid</hi> reporeth, a wild Beare) to bee driuen in amongſt the thickeſt troope of them, ſo to diſturbe and affright them in their cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious intendements, who at the firſt being ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſuddainely ſurpriſed, ſat aſtonied, but remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring themſelues, and being alſo halfe drunke, they furiouſly ſet vpon the beaſt, and with ſhort bils and kniues, and other ſuch like weapons as they had, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wed and cut it into a thouſand little peeces, and euery one ioying and reioicing in their victorie &amp; triumph, fell preſently again to drinking, of which being ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and ſubdued, in great furie they ranne vp and down, carrying in their hands ſome peece or other of the ſlaughtered beaſt, with making ſtraunge ſhrikes, ſhouts, and vncouth noiſe for the victorie therof, and thus through the woods, buſhes, hils, or vallies would they in an extreame furie, and forgetfulneſſe of ſence, confuſedly and out of order run galloping together. And euer afterward to eterniſe this their preuaileme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t ouer that beaſt, would they in their bacchinall feaſtes and drinking, carrie in one of their hands ſome ioint or other of a new kild heyfar.

Which opinion alſo <hi>Marcus Tullius</hi> confirmeth, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that this name of Fortune was firſt brought in and vſed to couer and ſhadow the ignorance of man, who (ſayth hee) giueth the ſucceſſe of all haps and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents vnto her, of which hee himſelfe by naturall iudgement can ſhew no reaſon: which onely procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the barrenneſſe and dulneſſe of wits and capacities, for ſo much as thoſe things and euents, whereof hee could giue any likely reaſon or conie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of probabilitie for the effect thereof, hee neuer aſcribed vnto this goddeſſe Fortune. But the Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents were no more deceaued in this, than in other the gods and goddeſſes, and therefore conſecrated and dedicated vnto her many Statues, Altars, Temples, and Pictures, adoring her as the abſolute diſpoſer and diſpenſatrix of mundane affaires and buſineſſes. And they ſuppoſed, that as well all euill, and bad miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheefes and inconueniences, as good and happy proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perities proceeded from her. By reaſon whereof, there was held to be two Fortunes, the one good, the other bad, and from the one came riches, happineſſe, quiet, content, and pleaſures: from the other all miſery, war, affliction, croſſes, and diſaſter calamities whatſoeuer.

Wherevpon ſhe was depictured with ſome, as hauing two faces, the one white and well-fauoured, the other blacke and diſproportioned. <hi>Alexander Neapolitanus</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Alexander Neapolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> reporteth, That at Preneſtes was a temple dedicated vnto Fortune, wherein was drawne out &amp; portrayed a Picture or Image in the ſhape and forme of two Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, both conioined together in the ſame Statue, and that it was there held and worſhipped in high reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and adoration: And it was taken for the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of Fortune. But yet amongſt moſt people, and according to moſt writers, there is acknowledged but one Fortune. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſayth (writing of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents <note place="margin">Pauſanias.</note> of antiquitie) that the moſt auncient Statue and Image of Fortune was that which <hi>Bupalus</hi> (that farre-famed Architector &amp; Ingrauer) compoſed and made in Greece, which picture afterwards the Smyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neans (people alſo of that Countrey) bought with a great ſumme of money. And the ſame was cut out and proportioned in the ſhape and likeneſſe of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, on whoſe head was infixed a round and circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ball, and in one of her hands ſhe held the horne of plentie and abundance, called Cornucopia: by which depicturance is plainely vnderſtood the office &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie of that goddeſſe, which is to haue the beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and giuing of great riches, wealth, and treaſures, the which notwithſtanding ſhee beſtoweth on men with ſuch vncertainety, that they neuer remaine long with them, but are vnſetled, vnſure, and quickely row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from them againe, as the heauens are toſſed and circumfered by the two poles, reſembled thereunto by the ball ſo placed vpon her head. <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſayth, <note place="margin">Lactantius.</note>

that vnto Fortune was giuen the ſterne or rudder of a ſhip, to ſignifie, that ſhee doth rule, commaund, and gouerne all humane things whatſoeuer, as the ſhip is gouerned by the rudder: and ſayth, that ſhee is vncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in all her gifts, mutable, and neuer aſſured, fauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and affecting for the moſt part wicked and irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious perſons, and aduancing men of meane worth, vertue, and learning, deiecting and oppreſſing the true children, and rightly begotten of the muſes, and thoſe in whom perfection of merit abideth.

               <p>And thus farre haue I continued the exclamations of an vnhappy louer, who in the ſame place alſo writ many other inuectiues againg Fortune and Loue, ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning them both together, which I will here preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, hauing already too much digreſſed from our cheefe intendement: reuerting therefore from whence we left you, it is written, that the Thebans in a certain ſtatue which they dedicated vnto Fortune (being alſo in the ſhape &amp; ſimilitude of a woman) placing in one of her hands a yong child, which they tearmed by the name of Pluto, which with many is taken to bee the god of riches: ſo that is diſcouered, by repreſenting Pluto in the forme of a child, that in the hands of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune was the beſtowing and diſpoſing of wealth, ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, poſſeſſions, and aduancements, commanding the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> and hauing that abſolute authority &amp; rule ouer them, as mothers gouerne and rule their children. <hi>Martianus</hi> thus deſcribes her to appeare at the mariage of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logia. <note place="margin">Martianus.</note> There was (ſaith he) among the reſt a young and beautifull woman, more talking and more abounding in idle diſcourſe and words then any of the reſt, who ſeemed to be full of geſtures and of fantaſtike carriage of her bodie, and alwaies mouing and ſtirring vp and downe, her vpper garment was of the thinneſt ſilke, whoſe lightneſſe the leaſt breath of wind would puffe vp, her ſteps and paces as ſhee went, were very vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, &amp; ſhe neuer would abide long in one place, or in one companie, and hee ſayth, that her name was Chaunce, which alſo is the ſame in ſence as Fortune,
<pb facs="tcp:8331:94"/>
and which likewiſe with ſome is called Nemeſis: ſhee carried in her lap (which was very ſpacious &amp; wide) almoſt all the ſundrie kinds and ſorts of all the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, ornaments, riches, and graces of the world, of which, ſome ſhee ſeemed to offer with her hand to ſome that ſtood by, but in ſo haſtie manner, and ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly as was poſſible, as that if they did not inſtantly take hold and accept of her curteſie, all what was offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red was loſt, to ſome ſhe ſeemed very familiar &amp; kind, dallying with them and playing with their locks, and vſing many other ſuch wanton and alluring behaui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours: but to ſome others againe ſhe would ſeeme mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous angry and diſpleaſed, ſtriking them ouer the faces and heads with a white wand, which ſhe held in her hand, and with ſuch ſigne and token of reuenge, as if ſhe had ben highly prouoked and incenſed, and would aſſuredly acquite her ſelfe on the offenders whoſoeuer.</p>
               <p>In a temple in Greece was erected a Statue of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, which was made in the ſorme and ſimilitude of a graue Matrone, habited and clothed in garments ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the deſires and faſhions of elder yeeres, and in her countenance ſhe ſeemed very ſad and penſiue: a little before her was placed the Image and portraiture of a young virgine, amourous in aſpect and pleaſant, which ſeemed to giue &amp; offer her hand to the picture of the other: behind theſe (euen hard at their heeles) was engrauen forth another Image in the likeneſſe of a young child, which with one of her armes ſeemed to leane on the picture of the ſad Matrone, which loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſo dolefull and heauie, ſignifies her ſelfe to bee
<pb facs="tcp:8331:95"/>
that Fortune which is alreadie paſt and ſlipt by, and therefore ſhe ſits lamenting and bewailing the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof. The other which ſeemed ſo pleaſant and offered her hand, is the preſent Fortune, and the yong infant behind them both, is that which is to come and ſucceedeth.</p>
               <p>Among the Ancients and among the old writers, Fortuna and Nemeſis were oftentimes taken to bee all one, yet at other times they made this difference and ſeuerall natures to appeare for Nemeſis: as <hi>Amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Marcellinus</hi> ſayth) was held and taken to bee the <note place="margin">Amianus Marcellinus</note> goddeſſe, to whom only it belonged to puniſh and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigate the offences of the wicked and male act is, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting them with paines and torments, according to the qualitie of their ſins; and alſo rewarded the vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and well-liuers with aduancements, honour, and titles of place and dignitie: and that ſhe did know and ſee all things euen into the darkeſt and moſt priuate corner of the world, &amp; therevpon was by the Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents ſuppoſed to be the daughter of Iuſtitia, who (ſay they) dwelt &amp; inhabited in a very ſecret corner, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the houſe of Eternitie, where ſhe noted downe in her books of memorie, the offences and wicked deeds of the euill. <hi>Macrobius</hi> ſayth, this Nemeſis was adored <note place="margin">Macrobius.</note> and worſhipped among the Aegyptians as the reuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and cheefe enemie of pride, inſolencie, &amp; haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſſe, and that ſhe was alſo with many called Rham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſia, ſo tearmed of a certain place among the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians; where alſo was erected and dedicated vnto hir a moſt ſtately and magnifique Statue of marble, and that ſhee was alſo ſometimes knowne by the name

of Adraſtia, of king Adraſtus, for that he was the firſt that euer cauſed her to be held in that worſhip and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerenced regard, and that euer conſecrated any altars or temples vnto her.</p>
               <p>The ſame Author alſo deſcribeth her, ſaying, that her picture was depainted and ſet forth with wings on her ſhoulders, to ſignifie, that ſhe was alwaies rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die and at hand amongſt men: hard by her ſide was placed the rudder of a ſhip, &amp; ſhe her ſelfe ſtood vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a round wheele, holding in hir right hand a golden ball, and in the other a whip, manifeſting thereby, that where ſhe fauoured or diſliked, either aduancements, wealth and honour, or miſeries, croſſes, and afflictions followed and enſued.</p>
               <p>She is oftentimes alſo depainted, as holding the bridle of a horſe in one of her hands, and in the other a ſmall and long peece of wood of a certain meaſure, which we call an ell or a yard: vnſhadowing thereby, that men ought to rule &amp; reſtrain their tongues from euill and corrupting ſpeeches, and that they ſhould adminiſter iuſtice and true meaſures with whom they deale or doe conuerſe.</p>
               <p>It is written with Pauſanias, that Nemeſis was the <note place="margin">Pauſanias.</note> moſt ſeuere and cruell puniſher of arrogancie &amp; vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glory of all others, &amp; ſaith, that ſhe abaſed &amp; brought downe the inſolencie and ouer-weening boldneſſe of the northerne barbarous people, who with an aſſured conqueſt and victorie (as they thought) entered into the countries of the Athenians, and there (ſcorning as it ſhould ſeeme) their ſmall forces and reſiſtances, fell to ſpoile and rifeling, and preſently ſet vp and
<pb facs="tcp:8331:96"/>
erected their huge Coloſſus, or piller of marble, which they of purpoſe brought with them to ingraue and ſet forth their victories, trophies, and ſpoiles that they ſhould make of their enemies: but being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ouercome themſelues, &amp; beaten back into their countries, the ſame ſtone the Athenians cauſed to be conſecrated vnto Nemeſis, whoſe picture and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter fet by the incomparable skill of Phidias, was moſt curiouſly and exactly ingrauen thereon, to ſhew ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, that ſhee only was the cauſe of the cleane ſubuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and expelling their fatall enemies out of their Countrey, and that ſhee therein extended her power and office to the reuenging and aboliſhing the ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haughtie attempts of pride, &amp; foole-hardie preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And in that ſhe was thus held to be puniſher of vaine humors, and prowd demeanures of mortals, the Ancients alſo held and ſuppoſed her to bee the verie ſame in nature and propertie as the goddeſſe Iuſtitia, whoſe deſcription (as <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> affirmeth) was by <hi>Chriſippus</hi> thus ſet forth and compoſed. <note place="margin">Aulus Gel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius.</note>

               <p>After that Ptolomie king of Aegypt had deliuered Apelles out of priſon, and reſtored him to libertie, when indeed he had once thought to haue puniſhed him with ſeuere tortures of death (hauing ouerlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly beleeued the vniuſt information of Antiphilus, who meerely of malice had accuſed him of a certaine rebellion and inſurrection in that Countrey) &amp; after that in lieu of ſuch his wrong of opprobrie and falſe impriſonment, he had giuen him a hundred talents, as part of amends for ſuch his trouble, &amp; had comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that Antiphilus ſhould alwaies afterwards be his ſlaue and bondman: for requitall of ſuch his iniurious practiſes, and ſlandering his integritie of life, hee in a fantaſticall humor, betooke himſelfe to his art, inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding by ſome curious deuiſe thereof to ſhew forth the depicturance of the danger &amp; perill of his life, which at the time of ſuch his accuſation hee then ſtood in, which was in this manner with incomparable know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of skil performed, being called <hi>Calu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>nia di Apelle:</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8331:97"/>
There was placed in a iudiciall and high ſeat, made (as it were) for the determining &amp; deciding of ciuile cauſes and affaires, the Statue of a man, with maruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous long ears, ſuch as Midas is reported to haue had, who there repreſented the preſence of a graue &amp; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerend Iudge. Vnto this Iudge two women (one of the one ſide, and the other on the other ſide) ſeemed to whiſper ſome matter or other in his eares, the one of them was called Ignorance, the other Suſpition, and hee held forth his hand towards another woman, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Calumnia, being of the ſhape of a beautifull, rich, and young woman, then comming &amp; approching to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him, ſhee was maruellous gorgeous in her ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, and of a paſſing faire aſpect, ſauing that at that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant ſhe ſeemed ſomewhat angrie, diſdainefull, &amp; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented, inſomuch, as her eies looked very red and fierie: In her left hand ſhe held a flaming torch, &amp; with her right ſhee ſeemed forcibly to draw &amp; plucke after her a young man by the haires of his head in moſt ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannicall ſort, who miſerablie and dolefully with both his hands erected toward the heauens, bemoned &amp; la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented his woe afflicted condition and ſtate: a little before her approched Enuie, which was in the forme of a wondrous leane old man, with pallid &amp; meagre face, on whoſe withered cheeks it ſhould ſeeme Time with the all cutting plow-ſhare of his remorſe-leſſe crueltie had wrought deepe furrowes, &amp; inuolued wrinkles. And immediately after her (Enuie vſhering them all) came two young women more, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to flatter and gloſe with her with perſuaſiue and inſinuating phraſes, extolling her beautie, and (as it
<pb facs="tcp:8331:98"/>
were, forcing her to aſſume a ſtrong opinion of her owne incomparable faireneſſe, &amp; ſeemed alſo to adore and decke her abillements and cloths with many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited and curious toies of fantaſie and delight: &amp; the one was called Deceit, and the other Trecherie, both ſiſters, and of one humor. After all theſe followed alſo another woman (whoſe name was Penitence) habited with vild ragged and baſe attirements, who infinitely deploring her beeing, ſeemed to crucifie her ſelf with ſtrange impaſſionated fits beyond all meaſure, who looking backe, and ſeeing another poore woman ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king haſt to ouertake her (called Truth) euen for verie ſorrow ſhame &amp; greefe, fell into diuers ſounds, &amp; was readie to die and depart from the world. And thus <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cianus</hi> deſcribes that picture, which was called <hi>Calum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia di Apelle.</hi> By which this little may bee obſerued, that the meaning of it is nothing elſe but a falſe &amp; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious accuſation, entertained and ſupported by the Iudge of one, that is not there himſelfe in preſence to purge and cleare himſelfe of that which is obiected againſt him, whoſe accuſer is oftentimes Enuy: ſecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and coadiuted by Deceit and Trecherie: the cauſe of the Iudges raſh ſentence, is Ignorance, together with Suſpition, and the imbracing of calumniation or ſlander of the innocent: the bewailing &amp; teares of Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence at the diſcouerie of Truth, ſhews the greefe and ſhame that the guiltleſſe and true perſons receiue by bringing their reputation in queſtion of villanie and diſhoneſty. And this ſhall ſuffice for the deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Picture of Apelles, with the explication thereof, returning to the finiſhing and concluding of
<pb facs="tcp:8331:98"/>
the Statues and Images dedicated vnto Fortune.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Quintus Curtius</hi> ſayth, That Fortune was depictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red among the people of Scythia, in the forme of a woman without feet, &amp; that there was placed round about at her right hand a number of little wings, firſt to ſignifie, that ſhee cannot ſtand faſt or firme, &amp; that her gifts and fauors are no ſooner giuen, but are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently loſt, &amp; doe (as it were) ſudainely flie from a man before they be fully intertained or poſſeſſed. <hi>Alexander</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Alexander Neapolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus.</note> 
                  <hi>Neapolitanus</hi> writeth, That with certaine people of Greece her Picture or Statue was wholly framed and compacted of glaſſe, as ſhewing thereby, that vpon euery ſmal occaſion, riches, and happineſſe are decai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, conſumed, and periſhed. And yet all the Ancients for the moſt part ſo abſolutely relied &amp; confided vpon her power and vertue, that they referred and attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all luckie ſucceſſes of battels &amp; other pleaſures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo vnto her fauor, kindnes, and good liking. In Rome (as <hi>Liuie</hi> reports) was erected a very ſumptuous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <note place="margin">Liuie.</note> by Camillus, which he dedicated vnto Fortune af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the victorious ouerthrow hee gaue vnto the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſcians.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Plutarch</hi> alſo ſpeaketh of another Temple which was dedicated vnto Fortune, which was built two miles out of Rome in that very place, where Coriola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, approching like a gallant captain in arms (though then againſt his country) met with his owne mother, and others of his kinred, at whoſe vrgent intreaties &amp; praiers, hee ſurceaſed to proceed in his (till then) im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable furie and wrath, and ſo that glorious Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politane of the world, was no doubt preſerued
<pb facs="tcp:8331:99"/>
from ſaccage and ruine at that time, for that before he had reſolutely vowed to burne &amp; conſume it to aſhes. And in this place (as I haue ſaid) was erected a temple vnto Fortune, where ſhe was portraied forth in braſſe to the reſemblance and true proportion of a woman, which afterwards (ſome Deuill hanting the ſame) was taken and held by thoſe faith-wanting Idolaters in great reuerence &amp; adoration, as a moſt infallible and true Oracle.</p>
               <p>It is written of Galba, that whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> he had taken away a certaine chaine or bracelet of gold from this Image of Fortune (which was then hung about her necke) &amp; had placed it on the Statue of Venus, that ſhee (that ſame very night following) appeared vnto him in his ſleepe with threatening meanes &amp; words of reuenge, which ſo appalled &amp; confounded his ſences, that not many daies after in a great affrightment and terror, he departed from this life ſpeechleſſe and dumbe many houres before he died.</p>
               <p>With many Authors it is written, that in a certain country of Aegypt Fortune is depictured, as turning round a great wheele made of glaſſe, on the top wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are ſet forth the pictures of many men playing ioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and in the pride of mirth and iolitie ſome others alſo climing &amp; endeuouring to aſcend to the top ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and others hauing newly attained it, precipitating and tumbling downe backe againe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spartianus</hi> writeth, that almoſt all the Romane Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours were ſo addicted to an opinion, which they <note place="margin">Spartianus.</note> embraced of the powerfull mightineſſe of this For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, that they kept euermore her picture or Image
<pb facs="tcp:8331:99"/>
in their bed-chambers, and other priuat places of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait, &amp; that when any of them died, the ſame Image was preſently caried into the lodging of the knowne ſucceſſor.</p>
               <p>The firſt (as <hi>Liuie</hi> affirmeth) that cauſed in Rome any temples to be erected vnto Fortune, was <hi>Seruius</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Liuie.</note> 
                  <hi>Tallius,</hi> the ſixt king of the Romanes. And yet <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Plutarch.</note> ſaith in his bookes intituled (The fortune of the Romanes) that <hi>Marcius,</hi> which was the fourth king (after their computation) was the firſt that dedicated or built any Statues or temples vnto this goddeſſe; &amp; that as this Empire attained higher and higher vnto her puiſſance and glorie, ſo the ſuperſtitious deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe people, increaſed for the reuerencing and worſhipping of Fortune, which afterwards ſpread it ſelfe throughout all Italie, though it continued no long time.</p>
               <p>The Philoſopher <hi>Cebes</hi> reſembled Fortune very fitly <note place="margin">Cebes.</note> vnto a Comedie, in which many actors appeare, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes in likeneſſe and ſimilitude of kings &amp; great monarchs, and preſently after performe the part of ſome rogue or villan, &amp; are become poore fiſhermen, ſlaues, and bondmen, and ſuch like. <hi>Socrates</hi> compared <note place="margin">Socrates.</note> her alſo vnto a common place of meeting, conuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, or theatre, where without all order or obſeruation as they come, men are placed and haue their ſeats; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reſpecting the worthineſſe or dignity of any among them whatſoeuer, all being intermingled, and confuſedly thronged together: ſhewing thereby, that Fortune without either reſpect of gentrie, worthines, or merit, but all vnaduiſedly, &amp; without order or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon beſtoweth her fauors, riches, and felicities.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:8331:100"/>
It is read, that <hi>Vupal</hi> was the firſt that in all Greece cauſed any Statues, altars, or temples to be conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted vnto this goddeſſe Fortune, and that in the towne of Smyrna he erected one moſt ſtately temple, in the midſt whereof, the portraiture of Fortune was placed; which picture was cut out &amp; carued with incredible curiouſneſſe of the workeman, and beautified &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with diuers delicat embelliſhments, and almoſt art-exceeding politures.</p>
               <p>In Egira a city of Achaia, the Image of Fortune was drawn forth in the ſhape of a maruellous fair woman, who held in one of her hands the horn of abundance, called Cornucopia, and in the other the boy Cupid: all which (as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> interpretes it) ſignifieth, that it little auaileth any woman to bee of a beautifull, amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, &amp; well-compoſed feature, if fortune in that bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die be wanting and abſent: meaning that beauty with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out riches or honor, loſeth partly her value &amp; eſteem among men, which riches are intended by that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nucopia, ſignifying abundance of wealth, and enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of much treaſure. And indeed he is very fortunate &amp; happy, that in his loue ſhall find beauty to be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoiſd with riches, and that the fruition of that ſhal be accompanied with the graces of Venus, and thoſe all-ouercomming accomplements.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Giraldus</hi> (writing of the gods of the ancients) ſaith, that with ſome Fortune is depictured riding on a <note place="margin">Giraldus.</note> horſe, who with his wonderfull and ſtrange ſwiftnes of gallop, caries her away almoſt inuiſible: and after her poſteth Deſtiny, with great furie and exceeding celerity, holding in her hand an yron bow ready bent, and aiming to ſtrike Fortune euen at the very heart.
<pb facs="tcp:8331:100"/>
This breefe depicturance may vnfold vnto vs the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaied and changing mutabilitie of Fortune, and her ſudain &amp; moſt ſwift departure from thoſe whom euen now ſhe fauoured &amp; highly aduanced: or that it ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, that ſhe is alwaies flying from deſtiny, ſeeking all means to auoid her co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pany, for that indeed theſe two can neuer accord or agree together; for ſo much as where Deſtiny ſets hir foot, Fortune is there as itwere inchanted &amp; coniured, as hauing no power, efficacie, or vertue. And thus much ſhal ſuffice for the depictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances &amp; deſcriptions, with the ſeuerall explications adioined, which are read in autenticke writers to bee made and deuiſed by the Auncients of this their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſſe Fortune.</p>

               <p>BEfore it bee diſcended to the deſcriptions of the images &amp; ſtatues dedicated vnto this goddes Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, it ſhall not be impertinent ſomwhat to touch the ſeueralnatures &amp; conditions vnderſtood &amp; ſignified by her, as being a furtherance &amp; light to conceiue the reaſons why ſo many diuers ſtatues &amp; pictures were ſo diuerſly faſhioned &amp; compoſed of her. According therfore to the opinion of the Poets, Venus was taken to be the goddeſſe of wantonnes &amp; amorous delights, as that ſhe inſpired into the minds of men, libidinous deſires, and luſtfull appetites, &amp; with whoſe power &amp; aſſiſtance they attained the effect of their loſe concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcence: whervpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> alſo they entermed her the mother of loue, becauſe that without a certaine loue &amp; ſimpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie of affections, thoſe deſires are ſildome accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed. And vnto hir they aſcribe the care and charge of
<pb facs="tcp:8331:101"/>
marriages and holie wedlockes, of which likewiſe it is written, that Himeneus &amp; Iuno are the protectors &amp; rulers. But according to the works of nature, which vnder this name, are indeed diuerſly vnderſtood, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus doth ſignifie that ſecret &amp; hidde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vertue by which all creatures whatſoeuer are drawne with aſſociation, effectuating thereby the art of generation: whervpon <hi>Macrobius</hi> ſaith, that from Venus is brought the deſire <note place="margin">Macrobius.</note> and humor of carnall luſts and voluptuouſnes, which afterward taking root more deeply, conduceth vnto a true accompliſhment therof. Some that haue written of theſe naturall cauſes, haue affirmed, that Venus, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no, Luna, &amp; Proſerpina haue ben al one, retaining on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different names and titles, in that many effects and iſſues proceeding from them, haue ben diuers and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerall. But leauing theſe opinions, let vs now enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Images &amp; Pictures made and compoſed of her.</p>
               <p>It is written with <hi>Philo</hi> (an Hebrew author of great antiquitie) that this Venus was born and ingendred of the froth of the ſea, taking force and vertue of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uities of Celum, which his ſon Saturn cut off &amp; threw down therin: and her ſtatue is framed in the ſhape of a moſt beautiful and amorous yong woman, which ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med alſo to ſtand vpright in the midſt of a huge ſhell of a fiſh, which was drawn by two other moſt vgly &amp; ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge fiſhes, (as <hi>Ouid</hi> at large noteth it) who alſo ſaith, <note place="margin">Ouid.</note> that vnto her was conſecrated the Iſland of Ciprus, &amp; eſpecially in it the city of Paphos, ſtanding by the ſea ſide, for that ſhe was ſeen and diſcouered vpon hir firſt apparance out of the ſea, to go on land on that part of the country: by reaſon wherof, the people therabouts adore and worſhip hir with great zeale &amp; veneration,
<pb facs="tcp:8331:101"/>
and erected and dedicated vnto her a moſt rich and ſtately temple very gorgeous and coſtly.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſaith, that Venus is drawne in a coach through the airie paſſages, with two white Doues (as <hi>Apuleius</hi> alſo affirmeth) being birds of all others moſt agreeable and pleaſing vnto her, &amp; are called the birds of Venus: for it is written indeed, that they are moſt abundantly inclined to procreation, &amp; that almoſt at all times of the year, they ingender, increaſe, and bring forth their young, of whome it is obſerued, that vpon their firſt aſſociation and coupling together, they do kiſſe one another, and as it were embrace, and friendly intertain their acquaintance and friendſhip; alluded to the faſhions and cuſtomes of amorous louers, in their firſt ſalutes, and times of daliance. <hi>Eleanus</hi> writeth, that <note place="margin">Eleanus.</note> theſe birds are ſo co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſecrated vnto Venus, for that (ſaith he) it is read, that on a certain mountain of Sicilia, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Erice, were kept and obſerued certain daies as holy daies and times of paſtime and diſport, the which the Sicilians tearmes The daies of paſſage; inſomuch (as the Indians report) that Venus paſſed and took hir ior<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in thoſe daies from thence into Libia, at which time not one doue was ſeene to remain behind in the country, as attending &amp; accompanying the goddeſſe in hir voiage, which being performed and ended, they al returned and came back again vnto their old haunts and accuſtomed places as before: whervpon after that, certain ſolemnities and rites were on that mountaine kept and celebrated.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> affirme, that the chariot of Venus is drawn by two white Swans, wherof <hi>Statius</hi> alſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth mention, ſaying, that thoſe kind of birds are moſt
<pb facs="tcp:8331:102"/>
mild, innocent, and harmeleſſe and therfore giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Venus: or that their harmonious &amp; pleaſant notes, which they ſing a litle before the approch of death, are compared to the amorous &amp; delightful diſcourſes and conferences of louers, which commonly afterward proue &amp; turn into ſorrow, miſery, or death. With the Grecians the image &amp; picture of this goddeſſe was ſet forth naked &amp; without cloths, as Praxitiles alſo an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent ingrauer in the Iſland of Guidos compoſed it: meaning therby, that al venerous &amp; licentious people are by ſuch their inordinat luſt, like beaſts, depriued of ſence, &amp; left as it were naked and deſpoiled of reaſon and the cloths &amp; garments of vnderſtanding; &amp; often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times alſo ſtripped and waſted of their priſtine &amp; for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer riches, and goods. And this picture there framed in that Iſle of Guidos, was wrought and cut out by the ſame Praxitiles with ſuch exquiſit art &amp; deepe-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged skil, that the deſire of the veiw and ſight therof drew and allured many paſſengers and voiagers by ſea to ſaile to Ciprus to ſatisfie their eies of what their eares ſo highly had heard commended.</p>
               <p>The ancients vſed to dedicat vnto this goddeſſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny plants &amp; flowers, among the which, ſpecially were the roſes, whoſe fragrant and ſweet odor is reſembled vnto the pleaſing delights &amp; outward faire ſhews and colours of loue, &amp; in that they are of that bluſhing and rubicund colour, and that they can hardly bee pluckt without their pricks, and moleſting mens fingers: they are likened vnto luxurious people, &amp; ſuch as giue the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues ouer to the vnbridled affections of carnality, for that ſuch vnlawful &amp; foule deſires are ſildome effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated without ſhame &amp; bluſhing, &amp; that there accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panieth
<pb facs="tcp:8331:102"/>
and conioineth with them, dolors, afflictions, paines, greefes, horrors, and a polluted conſcience, or els they are ſo compared, for that the color &amp; delicat hue of theſe roſes is ſoon faded, periſhed, &amp; dccaied, as the beuties of women, as alſo the delights &amp; pleaſures therof ſudainly fall away and are conſumed. But con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning theſe roſes, the Poets do inue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, that at the firſt they were of a milke white colour, &amp; grew verie pale and diſcoloured: vntil Venus on a certain time hauing intelligence that Mars (for ſome iealouſie conceaued) had complotted &amp; determined a deuiſe to haue mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her ſweethart Adonis, and ſhe in great haſt and rage running to preuent &amp; diſanull the intended miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheef, greeuouſly prickt hir foot on the ſtalks of theſe flowers, of which wound (ſending forth abundance of bloud) they were preſently turned into that freſh co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour which now at this time they do retaine.</p>
               <p>It is read with <hi>Pauſanias,</hi> that Marcellus erected and <note place="margin">Pauſanias.</note> dedicated a moſt ſumptuous temple vnto this goddes Venus: which he cauſed to be built two miles off from Rome, that thoſe kind of humors &amp; wanton pleaſures ought to bee remoted a farre off from the minds and thoughts of all chaſt virgines of Rome.</p>

                  <hi>Lactantius</hi> writeth, that the Lacedemonians framed <note place="margin">Lactantius.</note> &amp; compoſed the Image of Venus all armed like a war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior, holding in one hand a ſpeare, and in the other a ſhield or target, which depicturance they deuiſed in regard of a certain ouerthrow which the women of that cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>try gaue vnto their enemy the people of Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenia, and with ſucceſſe they ſuppoſed to haue procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the power and aſſiſtance of Venus, as inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into thoſe womans hearts manly courages, ſtont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
<pb facs="tcp:8331:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and reſolutions. In memory whereof, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies afterward reputed Venus to be of moſt forcible power and mightineſſe in arms, and after that beleefe reuerenced, adored, and worſhipped hir. Concerning which depicturance and ſetting forth of the ſtatue of Venus, <hi>Auſonius</hi> in a certain Epigram made by him to that purpoſe, ſaith, that Pallas was moſt wonderfully <note place="margin">Auſonius.</note> incenſt, and mightily ſtomacked ſuch deſcription ſet out in that maner, and that ſhe preſently fel into great contention and quarrell with Venus, for allowing it ſo to be done, that ſhe of her ſelf any way ſhould ſeem therby to take vpon her any martiall performances or exploits, derogating and detracting from her honor, dignity, and worthineſſe. In which Epigram alſo <hi>Auſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> declareth how prowdly and gallantly Venus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered her thereunto: as that ſhe wondered and ſtood amaſed how Pallas durſt now be ſo raſh, bold &amp; ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hardie, as to accuſe or braue her therein, conſidering that ſhe ſtood then all armed, and had much more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uantage againſt her, than ſhe had vpon the mountain Ida, wherein likewiſe by the verdict of Paris, ſhe vtter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then confounded and ouerthrew her mightineſſe, and made hir depart away aſhamed, angry and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. All which argumentation &amp; ſtriuing contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſies, the ſame authour moſt exquiſitely there hath ſet down and depainted. And thus far only in this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe ſhal be progreſſed, as not aduenturing to diſpleaſe the modeſt in capitulating ſuch ouer-wanton and too laſcious expoſitions and meanings which the Aunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents made and vnderſtood of the natures, qualities, properties, and conditions, of this their goddeſſe Venus.</p>
