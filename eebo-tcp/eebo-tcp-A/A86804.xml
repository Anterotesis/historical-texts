            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THat the Liturgie, and the Church Governement be continued vntill otherwiſe ſome alterations may be for a free, and well choſen SINOD, and that in the meane time the diſturbers thereof may be diſcountenanced, and that you endeavour to remoue all Jealouſies and miſunderſtandings between his MAJESTY and PARLIAMENT, the diſcontents within being the greateſt evills that can happen unto us, and which We moſt feare; and to take into your conſideration his MAJESTIES Meſſage of 20. JANUARY, as the means propoſed for an accommodation, and that you will provide for his Majeſties ſecurity by declaring againſt Tumults, and unlawfull aſſemblyes, and that you will take Order to ſuppreſſe Seditious Sermons, and Pamphlets, which his Majeſty declares He expects, as the meanes to come neere His PARLIAMENT.</p>
            <p>2. That ſeeing his Majeſty and Parliament do not agree in a new way, for ſetling the MILITIA: it is humbly deſired that the Trained Bands may be ſet into ſuch a Poſture &amp; Government as in the time of QUEENE ELIZABETH, untill a law be made, and that the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute about the manner of doing it may not actuate deviſion in the meane time.</p>
            <p>3. That the Subject may have the benefit of the Petition of right both for his Perſon and eſtate in all caſes, and in all Courts, and that the lawes of our Kingdome may be the only rule of Government and obedience.</p>
            <p>4. That whereas great ſumes of Mony have been levyed by Act of Parliament, and great are now required; we beſeech you to take notice that the Country is much impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and will unwillingly beare any burthen of this kind, but ſuch as ſhal be imployed for the generall ſervice of this Kingdom, and Bleeding Kingdome of JRELAND. And therefore we humbly pray that it may be made knowne how thoſe former Colecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been diſpoſed, which wil be a great incouragement for the ready payment of the preſent.</p>
            <p>5. Laſtly, whereas and ſeeing his Majeſty hath often with ſundry Proteſtations de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to his Parliament and People, that he will ever maintaine the true Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion eſtabliſhed, the Lawes of the Kingdom and the Liberty of the Subject; which we do confidently beleeve.</p>
            <p>We further humbly beſeech you, that the diſpute about Prerogative and the feare of the Malignant party or other Jealouſies, may not imbroile you in the greateſt of evils, as are thoſe of civill diſcention and ingagement, and that you do your utmoſt to alay diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and heedfully watch over the Peace and ſafety of this Kingdome; In which we will joyne with you our earneſt Prayers, and willingly adventure our ſelves and fortunes.</p>
