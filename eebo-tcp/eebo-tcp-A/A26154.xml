            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>BEtween three and four Years ago came out <hi>A Letter to a Convocation-Man, concerning the Rights, Powers, and Priviledges of that Body;</hi> which, together with the Replys that were made to it by Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> and some Other Writers, led the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of these Papers to consider the Point in Debate with a Particular Care and Application. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesses he came to Dr. <hi>W's</hi> Book, with expectations of finding there whatever was necessary to set this matter in a clear Light; The Bulk of the Work, the Appearance of Learning it carried, and the Great Authority by which it endeavored to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it self, All seem'd to promise Exactness. But upon perusing it, to his Surprize, he found, that it was a Shallow, Empty performance; writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, without any Knowledge of our Constitution, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Skill in the Particular subject of Debate; upon such Principles as are destructive of all our <hi>Civil,</hi> as well as <hi>Ecclesiastical</hi> Libertys; and with such Aspersions on the Clergy, both Dead, and Living, as were no less injurious to the Body than his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
            <p>The Love I bear to Truth, to my Church, and Country, soon gave me Resolution of stating this matter anew, and of taking off the slight Colors under which Dr. <hi>W.</hi> had disguis'd it: if at least, I were not prevented by some Abler Hand, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
<pb facs="tcp:48421:3"/>
by the Author of that <hi>Letter</hi> which first gave rise to this Debate; and who, it was expected, would have appear'd once more upon it, and freed what he had advanc'd from all Exceptions. This, and some other Accidents were the Cause that the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Papers, though prepar'd early, saw the Light no sooner; and have indeed been deferr'd so long, till it is now grown absolutely necessary to say something in Defence of the Churches Rights, or to sit down contentedly under the Loss of them. For by this time Dr. <hi>W's</hi> Book, Weak as it is, has yet, by not being oppos'd, gotten strength, and made its way into the good Opinion of many who wish not ill to the Order. A Learned Adversary in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed has taken him to Task upon the General Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of Church-Discipline and Government: but in the Domestick Part of the Dispute, which relates to our <hi>Own Laws and Usages,</hi> nothing has been said. For which reason, even from well meaning Men, we every day hear this Language,
<q>If the Dr. has indeed misrepresented the Constitution, why does not some body set it right again? If<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he has given up the Libertys and Priviledges of his Church, how comes the Body to be silent? They understand their Own Rights sure, and will not suffer themselves to be writ out of'em: we must believe therefore, that they have 'em not, if no body thinks fit to claim them.</q>
This indeed is the Natural Construction, which People must, and do make of our silence; and his Principles therefore must either quickly be disprov'd, or prevail. Nay upon these Principles, a suitable Practise may soon establish it self; and as Some New Customs first made way for his Doctrine, so the Doctrine it self may make way for Others; which when once taken up, will be difficultly laid down: for it is
<pb facs="tcp:48421:3"/>
much easier to preserve a Constitution, than to retreive it.</p>
            <p>Already, since he wrote, it has so hapned, that, upon the Calling of a New Parliament, the Writ for the Province of <hi>York</hi> has been dropp'd; thro' Forgetfulness, no doubt: however, for the same reason, it may so happen again, when another Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament is call'd, that the Writ for the Province of <hi>Canterbury</hi> shall be forgotten too. And if it should withall be forgotten to be Claim'd, as well as Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su'd, We should then be in the same case with our Neighbours of the Church of <hi>Ireland;</hi> among whom, as I am inform'd, Convocation-Writs are now grown out of Date; two New Parliaments having been successively summon'd, without them.</p>
            <p>And by the same Degrees that the Convocations of the Establisht Church have declin'd in both these Countrys, those of our Brethren of the Separation have begun to revive. The Summer after Dr. <hi>W's</hi> Book came out, a <hi>General Meeting</hi> of the Dissen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Ministers was appointed here in <hi>London,</hi> as appears by the Date of the <hi>Newbury</hi>-Letter, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the <hi>Appendix</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Numb. 11.</hi>
               </note>: and it is not long ago, since the <hi>Irish</hi> Nonconformists met publickly at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and printed a Sermon preach'd at the Opening of their Synod; tho' I think the Establisht Clergy there have never been Synodically conven'd, since the Revolution. And how affairs stand in <hi>Scotland,</hi> with relation to these matters, the Reader, if he desires Information, may in the <hi>25th.</hi> Page of the following Papers, find it.</p>
            <p>Nor is it to be forgotten, that since this New Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine came abroad, a New Definition of Convocations has obtain'd; which we are now told, are only <q>
                  <hi>Occasional</hi> Assemblys, for such Purposes as the King shall direct <note n="*" place="margin">Nicolson <hi>Hist. Lib. Vol. 3. p. 200.</hi>
                  </note>. <hi>And even the New State
<pb facs="tcp:48421:4"/>
of</hi> England-<hi>Man</hi> has upon it varied his Phrase: for his last Edition says, that they are to meet <hi>now and then,</hi> in Time of Parliament <note n="†" place="margin">Meige. <hi>N. S. of E. part. 3</hi>d. <hi>p. 64.</hi>
                  </note>.</q>
It may seem not Material to observe any thing that falls from such a Pen: but it shews how Common Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion runs, as much as if a Wiser Author had said it.</p>
            <p>It was High time therefore to assert a Right, which was so far endanger'd. And this, unequal as I may be to the Task, yet rather than it should remain undone, I have resolv'd to do: not led so much by Inclination to studys of this kind, as push<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on by an Hearty concern for the Interests of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and of my Order (as far as the Latter of these is subservient to the Former), and by an Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger Desire of doing somewhat towards supporting the Good Old Constitution I live under: which Dr. <hi>W.</hi> has, both in Church, and State, done his best to undermine. His Blow indeed is directly levell'd at the Rights and Libertys of the Church only; but it glances often on those of the State, and wounds them sore, as far as His Arm was capable of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting strength into it: The Argument of his Book throughout turns upon such Maxims and Grounds, as equally affect Both of them. And because I am not willing to say any thing against him without good Proof, I shall here give the Reader a short Tast of his Principles, to prepare him for the larger Entertainment that follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P. 84.</hi> He proposes this Question,
<q>Whether the Prince should be allow'd a Power to <hi>alter,</hi> or <hi>improve,</hi> what a Synod has defin'd, to <hi>add to,</hi> or <hi>take from</hi> it?—and thus he resolves it— Sure I am, that this Princes have done; and so I think they have Authority to do. <hi>For since the Legislative Power is lodg'd in their hands, so that they may make what
<pb facs="tcp:48421:4"/>
Laws or Constitutions they think fit for the Church, as well as the State:</hi> since a Synod in matters relating to Discipline is but a kind of Council to them, in Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Affairs; whose Advice having taken, they may still act as they think fit: seeing, lastly, a Canon, drawn up by a Synod, is but as it were <hi>Matter prepar'd for the Royal Stamp;</hi> the last forming of which, as well as enforcing whereof must be left to the Princes Iudgment: I cannot see why the Supreme Magistrate, who confessedly has a Power to confirm, or reject their Decrees, may not also make such other Use of them as he pleases; and <hi>correct, improve,</hi> or otherwise <hi>alter</hi> their Resolutions, according <hi>to his Own Liking,</hi> before he gives his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to them <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>P. 85.</hi>
                  </note>.</q>
He is speaking here, I confess, of the Power of the Prince, at large, without pointing his words particularly on <hi>England:</hi> but since he asserts this Power to every Prince, and does not except Ours, it is manifest he means him as much as if he had particularly mention'd him.
And this he himself is not shy of owning: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the End of this Chapter, he in plain terms tells us, that <q>by Our Own Constitution, the King of <hi>England</hi> has all that Power over Our Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that <hi>ever any</hi> Christian Prince had over his Synods <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>P. 98.</hi>
                  </note>.</q>
And goes on afterwards <note n="⸪" place="margin">
                  <hi>P. 136.</hi>
               </note> to shew, that <hi>H.</hi> the <hi>VIII.</hi> did this very thing in <hi>1536; correcting,</hi> and <hi>amending</hi> with his Own Hand, <hi>the Articles of Religion</hi> then drawn up, before they were publish'd. He does not indeed expresly Iustify this Act of <hi>H.</hi> the <hi>VIII;</hi> but which is all one, he mentions it, without a word to shew that he disapprov'd it.</p>
            <p>I will be bold to say, that were this single Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb facs="tcp:48421:5"/>
true, the <hi>Late King</hi> might have gone a great way toward subverting our Religion, without break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in upon the Constitution, or doing any thing Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal. He might have assembled the Clergy, and commanded their Iudgment upon such and such Points, and then alter'd their Resolutions <hi>to his Own Liking;</hi> and so have set up Rank Popery under the Countenance of a Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant Convocation. Especially if he had call'd this other Principle of Dr. <hi>W's</hi> into his Aid—
<q>Some of our Princes (he says) have not only prescrib'd to our Convocations what they should go about, but have <hi>actually drawn up before hand</hi> what they thought <hi>Convenient</hi> to have established; and have requir'd them to approve of it, without submitting it to their Iudgments, whether they approv'd of it or not <note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>[P. 110.]</hi>
                  </note>.</q>
Which <hi>Fact</hi> also he gives us as a <hi>Right,</hi> without insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating the least Dislike of it. And a very <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient</hi> Right it is for Princes, that meditate New Schemes of Church Government. Twelve Years ago, enforc'd by the Pen of a <hi>Parker,</hi> or a <hi>Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright,</hi> it might have done great Service: it would have helpt on all the Pious Designs then upon the Anvil; and if the Asserter of it had not been a Bishop, to be sure it would have made him one. Can such Doctrines ever be Serviceable (I say not Grateful) to This Government, which would have ruin'd our Establish'd Religion, under the Former?</p>
            <p>But his <hi>Conclusions</hi> are not worse than his way of <hi>coming at</hi> them; which is, in this, and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry case, first by shewing what has been practis'd by the <hi>Emperors,</hi> and other <hi>Absolute</hi> Princes, and by asserting the same Power to belong to <hi>Our</hi> King, <hi>as</hi> a King; not by vertue of the particular Laws and Usages of this Realm, but <hi>by the

               </note> says out of the <hi>Journal</hi>) this that follows.</p>
            <p>
               <q>
                  <hi>4thly,</hi> The Doctor draws his Arguments from the <hi>Imperial Laws</hi> of the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors,</hi> an argument which may be urg'd with as great reason, and with as great Authority for the <hi>reduction of the State of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of</hi> England <hi>to the Polity and Laws in the Time of those Emperors</hi>; as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to make the Laws and Customs of <hi>Rome,</hi> and

                  <hi>Constantinople</hi> to be binding and obligatory to the Citys of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>York.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The issue of which Complaint was, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, for these his Outlandish Politicks, was taken into Custody, and his Book condemn'd to the <hi>Flames:</hi> Nor could the <hi>Dedication</hi> of it to his then Grace of <hi>Canterbury</hi> save it; who did not think himself concern'd to countenance whatever Doctrine any Indiscreet Writer should take the Liberty to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe to him.</p>
            <p>He that thinks a Prince <hi>Absolute</hi> in <hi>Spirituals,</hi> thinks him, no doubt, as Absolute in <hi>Temporals,</hi> and will, when a Proper time shall come, not stick to say so. Dr. <hi>W.</hi> has given some significant Hints that way in the words already produc'd from him: for what else can he mean by the <hi>Legislative Powers</hi> being <hi>lodg'd in the Princes hands, so that he may make what Laws he pleases, for the Church as well as the State;</hi> if we consider him to speak, as he does, of the <hi>Prince,</hi> exclusively to the <hi>Three Estates</hi> of the Realm? And when he adds therefore, a few Lines afterwards, that <hi>a Canon</hi> is only <hi>matter prepar'd for the Royal Stamp,</hi> we are not at a loss to know, what fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he aims at: This is doctrine, that at a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Season, will serve as well for <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> as <hi>Canons.</hi> Let us hear some more of it.</p>
            <p>One great Position of Dr. <hi>W.</hi> is, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation cannot move a step, but as they are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the King, or <hi>debate</hi> of any thing but just what he impowers them to consider. And thus far he is safe in his Assertion, for un<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>itting As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblys may be insulted at pleasure. But when he tells us further, that the <hi>Parliament it self is as much directed by the King in the
<pb facs="tcp:48421:6"/>
main part of their Debates as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation is</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>P. 289.</hi>
               </note>, the Comparison begins to be saw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and may prove Dangerous. He would seem to qualify it indeed by saying, that <hi>the Parliament are as much, though not as necessarily di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected:</hi> but this does not much soften the Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion; for still it leaves the Parliament <hi>as much</hi> (though not as <hi>necessarily</hi>) Slaves in the Point of Freedom of Debate, as Convocations are said to be; and is, I dare say, such an Instance of Free Speech as was never yet practis'd towards a Par<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>Another of his Maxims is, that <q>whenever a Synod meets, the King may give Direction for the <hi>Choice</hi> of the Persons that are to compose it, that so he may be satisfy'd, that they are such whose Piety and <hi>Temper</hi> has fitted them to serve the Church, and in whose <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> he himself may <hi>safely confide</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>P. 42.</hi>
                  </note>.</q>
And then, by vertue of his General Rule, [that gives to Our Princes <hi>all</hi> that Power which <hi>ever any</hi> Christian Prince had over their Synods] he brings it home to us, and says, that the <hi>Choice</hi> of the Persons composing our Convocation is thus <hi>deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd</hi> by the <hi>King's Writ</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>P. 103.</hi>
               </note>: which implys, that his Writ might <hi>determin</hi> the <hi>Choice</hi> otherwise, that he might order more, or fewer to be sent up; or New ones to be return'd in the Room of those whose <hi>Temper</hi> he shall not approve of, and whose <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> he cannot <hi>safely confide in.</hi> And if he can deal thus with our Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Writs and Members; what hinders but he that may deal thus also with those of Parliament? for his Writs alike <hi>determin</hi> the <hi>Choice,</hi> as to Both these Meetings; and then there's an End of our Constitution, whenever a Prince arises that has any Ill Designs upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48421:7"/>The laying aside of Convocations is thus justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd by Dr. <hi>W.</hi> in divers parts of his Book <note n="*" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pp. 107.227, 250.</hi> &amp;c.</note>, that the Great and almost Onely Use that has been made of them, was <hi>to raise Money;</hi> and that Use therefore being now out of Doors, there is no need of regularly assembling them. Let us apply this to Parliaments, and suppose, that the King's Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue was so setled, and the Publick Debts so far discharged, that there was no occasion for them to sit for the giving of Money; would there be no occasion therefore for their sitting at all, in order to assist the Crown with their <hi>Counsels,</hi> or to redress <hi>Grievances</hi>? This is unavoidably the Consequence of Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s way of arguing; and he seems not to be asham'd of it: for <hi>p. 207.</hi> he thus accounts for the <hi>Rise</hi> and <hi>Birth</hi> of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as now setled:
<q>They were to meet, he says, when requir'd, and that as often as the Prince <hi>wanted Money,</hi> or expected a <hi>Supply</hi> from them.</q>
Can a Man talk at this rate, and pretend to be an <hi>Englishman?</hi> Or can true <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishmen</hi> stand by, and hear him talk thus, without resenting the Indignity?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Clergy</hi> therefore are not the only Persons concern'd in this Dispute, the <hi>Laiety</hi> too have their share in it. For besides that, if Slavery be once establisht in the Church, it will quickly spread it self into the State, Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s Principles, we see, are such as have an Immediate Tendency to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward subverting <hi>Liberty in General;</hi> and would, if pursu'd through their just Consequences, give the Prerogative as high an Ascendant over Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments, as Convocations. And when such things are said therefore, not the Men of the Church on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but every Freeborn subject of <hi>England</hi> ought to take the Alarm; for their Birthright is endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48421:7"/>The very best Construction that has been put upon Dr. <hi>W</hi>'s Attempt by Candid Readers is, that it was an Endeavor to advance the Prerogative of the Prince in Church-matters as high, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the Interest of the Subject Spiritual as low as ever he could, with any Colour of Truth. But surely this it self is no very creditable account of it. Those Casuists that have taken pains to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct men, how near they may possibly come to a sin without actually sinning, have not been rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd the honestest part of their Profession. And those Divines, who read Lessons to Princes, how to strain their Ecclesiastical Power to the utmost without exceeding it, and oppress their Clergy le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally, are not surely the best Men of their Order. They are Church-<hi>Empsons,</hi> and <hi>Dudleys;</hi> and usually find the fate of such Wretched Instruments, to be detested by the One side, and at last abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Other.</p>
            <p>Were all that Dr. <hi>W.</hi> says strictly true and justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable, yet whether the laboring the point so hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily as he does, and shewing himself so willing to prove the Church to have no Rights and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, be a very Decent Part in a Clergyman, I leave his Friends to consider. The World, I fear, is so ill natur'd as to believe that seldom any Man is over busy in lessening the Publick Interests of that Body to which he belongs, who does not hope to find his Private Account in it. But when all a Man advances is not only ill design'd, but ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grounded, and his Principles are as False as they are Scandalous (as I have evidently prov'd his to be) there are no Names, and Censures too bad to be bestowed on such Writers, and their Writings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48421:8"/>Will it be said, in his Excuse, that he wrote his Book in the Dark, without a Competent Skill in the subject of it? and that his Mistakes there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are the Effects of Pure Ignorance? allowing it; how came he then to write at all in a Matter that he was not (and could not but know, that he was not) Master of? How came he to express himself so peremptorily in such Tender Points, wherein the Great Priviledges of his Church, and the Chief Interests of his Order are concern'd? Was there less of Wisdom, or Honesty in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voring to <hi>write down</hi> these, without being sure that he had good grounds for it?</p>
            <p>In truth, though the best thing that can be said for Dr. <hi>W.</hi> is, that he wrote at this rate, because he knew no better; yet I fear, that even this it self cannot be justly pleaded. For as little as he knows of these matters, he seems to have known yet more than he was willing to own; and enough to have kept him from engaging on that side of the Question he has done, if some very Powerful Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive had not come in to determin him. Those lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle shifting Equivocal Forms of Speech he is so full of, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>se savings and softnings he throws in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, shew, that the Thistles he was mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling did not pass easily; and that he had not only no Assurance that he was in the Right, but a Shrewd Guess that he was in the Wrong; and laid in matter therefore for Evasion against he should have need of it. So that whenever he thinks fit to make a Reply, I question not but this will be one main part of it,
<q>That He, Good Man, is much mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>understood, and his Opinions ill represented; which are, at the bottom, and taken together, very Innocent and Blameless: since whatever he has said that may sound harsh, in any one part
<pb facs="tcp:48421:8"/>
of his Book, he has unsaid again, explain'd, and qualify'd in another.</q>
I will not deny him to have, in several Instances, a Right to this Plea, such an one as it is: But He who makes use of it does, in effect, own, that he had taken upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self the hard Task of maintaining a Point, which yet he saw was not defensible; and that his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science star'd him in the Face, every step that he took: nevertheless, being in, he was resolv'd to go through with it. And if this Excuse will be of any service to him, by my Consent he shall be allow'd it.</p>
            <p>Could we excuse his <hi>III Principles,</hi> yet what shall we say to those <hi>Injurious Reflections</hi> that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them? Those Slights, and Reproaches, he so Liberally casts on his Order, when it has the Ill Luck to come in his way? Many Actions of the Old Popish Clergy ly open enough in Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to censure: but he is sure always to give the Worst and most Invidious turns to them. He never distinguishes between the Men, and their Popery; but censures them in the gross, and in such a Manner sometimes as to leave the Reader in doubt, whether the Function it self were not in fault.</p>
            <p>The Clergy of his Own Time are dealt with yet worse by him. That part of them, which desire a Convocation (that is, by his Leave, the far Greater part of them) are so represented by him, as if they were Irregular in their Lives, Violent in their Tempers, and Factious in their Principles <note n="†" place="margin">

            <p>Must we believe that the Friends of Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have been represented under the same Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours to his Majesty that they are to the Reader? as Enemies to his Government, Hot, Immoral; considerable neither for their Merit, Interest, nor Number?

Were a Convocation the Desire of a small Despicable Party only, and not of the Generality of the Clergy, how come such Assemblys to be laid aside, where a few Men, though never so furious, would make no figure, nor be able to disturb measures?</p>
            <p>And as to the Charge of Immorality, it runs high indeed; but 'tis to be hop'd that it is ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less.

And till they do so, this Censure of Dr. <hi>Wakes</hi> must pass for a Scandalous Reflection both on their Lordships and his Brethren.</p>
            <p>But this is the Ordinary Cry of Designing Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who from hence raise to themselves a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of Impartiality, of a singular Integrity, and Courage.

And his Former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensions, should they have been somewhat too Free, are capable of this Excuse; that being a <hi>Stranger,</hi> he might not then have throughly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted himself with the state of our Church, or the Characters of its Members: And if he saw faults in them, it was not to be expected that he should conceal them with the same Tenderness, as if he had had his Birth and Breeding amongst them. But Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> is neither Above those he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves, nor has drawn a different Air from them; He was Baptiz'd and Educated in Our Communion, and receiv'd his first Impressions of Men and Things in an University, a Place that has not been thought apt to instill into its Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers a Disesteem of their Holy Mother, or a love of blackening and betraying their Brethren. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks Men, who talk so much of Moderation and Temper, would do well to shew it, in allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:48421:11"/>
a Common share of those Good Qualitys to some of their Neighbours, who can be contented well enough without <hi>Titles;</hi> but are however ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry loth to be stript of their <hi>Good Names.</hi> The Comfort of such Good Men, whom his General and Undistinguishing Censures have thus aspers'd, must be, to say to themselves, as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> once did; <hi>Neque nobis Ignominia est pati à fratribus quae passus est Christus, nec illis Gloria est fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere quae fecerit Judas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was the Abhorrence I had of this Unworthy Treatment which the <hi>Reputation</hi> and <hi>Rights</hi> of the Order have found from Dr. <hi>W.</hi> and of the <hi>Slavish Tendency</hi> of his <hi>Principles,</hi> in respect both to <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>State,</hi> that gave me Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of exposing the Weakness and Insincerity of his Attempt, and of doing Right to Truth, and an Injur'd Constitution.</p>
            <p>He has modestly wish'd this Argument a <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Hand,</hi> and a <hi>Better Head</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Pref. p. VI.</hi>
               </note> than his Own. How far in these respects I am fitted for the Service, I cannot say: However One Quality there is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd by Him, but no less requisite than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of these; a <hi>Better Heart,</hi> I mean; and that, I am sure, I have brought along with me to the Work: and should there be further Occasion for it, I trust, that it will not fail me. The Dr. I do not doubt (considering on which side he wrote) thought himself as secure in his Defyance as a Crown-Champion at a Coronation; and that No body would have been hardy enough to take up the Gaunt let he threw down. Something of this kind seems to have been in his Thoughts, when he said, that <hi>the Gentleman</hi> he attacks, had <hi>written in such a manner, as would not, he suppos'd, at
<pb facs="tcp:48421:11"/>
all encourage any one to stand up in defence of him</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Ib. p. 1.</hi>
               </note>. But in this, as well as in a Thousand Other things, he finds his Mistake. There are, he sees, Those, who will not desert Truth when it grows out of fashion; and have Courage enough to espouse a Good Cause; though Great Names, and Great Interests are made use of to discoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance it. Not that the Author of these Papers is concern'd any ways to vindicate the <hi>Manner</hi> of that <hi>Gentleman's Writing,</hi> whom the Doctor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages; it is his <hi>Argument</hi> only that he undertakes to defend: in which he thinks him to have dealt both Skilfully and Honestly, professes himself freely to be of his Opinion, has reasserted it here in this Book, and will, by the Divine Assistance, go on to maintain it.</p>
            <p>He matters not what Dirt may be thrown at him on this account; he expects to traduc'd by little Officious Pens (and by Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s, the least of them) as <hi>Disaffected,</hi> and <hi>Undutyful.</hi> But as he is satisfy'd of the Uprightness of his Intentions, and knows how full his Heart is of Duty and Respect toward Those, whose Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters ought always to be, and shall ever be Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred with him; so he thinks he has taken a very proper way of expressing it in what follows; where, it seems to him, that he pleads for his Majesty's Honor, and my Lord Archbishop's Interest more effectually than they can pretend to do who differ from him. It is certainly for the Honor of the Crown to be attended always with the Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil-Spiritual of the Realm, as well as Temporal; and my Lords Grace of <hi>Canterbury</hi> is never so Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable, as when he is at the Head of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of his Province. The Author is perswaded
<pb facs="tcp:48421:12"/>
that he cannot make a more wellcome Present to good Governors, either in Church or State, than by affording them a True Account of the Wants and Rights of such as are entrusted to their Care; and an Opportunity, by that means, of exerting their Power to the Good Ends for which it was design'd. And They who shall represent him as <hi>Disaffected,</hi> on this account, do not sure consider what a kind of Compliment they make to Those for whose Interests they pretend to be so warmly concern'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Disaffection to the Government,</hi> as the Charge is commonly manag'd, is a Word only, made use of by those that are in favor to keep others out; it is a Reproach taken up on purpose to justify premeditated Designs of oppressing Men: For so the Soldier said, that the Countryman <hi>whist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> Treason, when he had resolved to plunder him.</p>
            <p>For my part, I am not shy of Owning to Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> my naked Thoughts on this Head; and he may make what Use he thinks fit of them. If then, to be a True Lover of <hi>England,</hi> its Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, and Episcopacy; if, to have the Utmost Esteem for the Heroick Qualitys and Matchless Merits of our Prince, and to think no Instance of Respect and Duty that Subjects can pay him, too great, while they take care to preserve their Own Rights and Priviledges; if to preferr the True Interests of the Protestant Religion, and the Preservation of our Civil Libertys, to all other Considerations, and for these (among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) Ends to pray heartily for the Continuance of our Present Government, both in Church and State; if these be Instances and Marks of Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection,
<pb facs="tcp:48421:12"/>
then the Author of these Papers must own himself disaffected, and not otherwise.</p>
            <p>No, the Imputation is more justly to be laid at Their Door, who are for such New Methods and Practises, as naturally tend to alienate the Hearts and Affections of Subjects, and make Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments uneasy; who blast great Numbers of Good Men with Ill Names, and endeavour to make them (what they are not) disaffected, by so representing, and using them, as if they were: And at the same time that they would have others thought Unwilling to serve the Crown, take care effectually to disable themselves from serving it, by forfeiting all the Credit and Interest they have among their Brethren.</p>
            <p>For what can the Clergy think of such Men as bend all their Wit and Skill to dress up Schemes for suppressing their Parliamentary <hi>Assemblys?</hi> and even their <hi>Summons?</hi> for rendring their Body, as such, Useless to the State, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence Contemptible? in a word, for introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the <hi>Portuguese</hi> Model of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; by which, a late Author tells us <note n="†" place="margin">
                  <hi>Account of the Court of</hi> Portugal <hi>p. 22.</hi>
               </note>, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance of the Lower Orders is excus'd, and their Bishops, with the Assistance of the Pope, act for them, and conclude them? Can any Mem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ber of the Church, that has his Eyes open, think such Men Friends to it? or so treat them, and speak of them, as if they were?</p>
            <p>How is it to be expected that this Management should work on the Inferior Clergy? What else can it produce in them but Distrusts, Uneasines<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, Complaints, and Endeavors of Righting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb facs="tcp:48421:13"/>
as they are able? The Projectors of such Schemes may fancy them proper Methods of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mens Passions asleep, but will in the End find, that they are the sure Ways of raising them. Nothing will by this Means be Effectually laid asleep, but the Churches Parliamentary Meetings; and it is well if the Dose given them be not so strong, as to make them sleep their Last.</p>
            <p>Does it at all soften the severity of this Usage, to tell the Clergy, That it is really for their true Interest and Service, if they would but under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand it? That they are a Number of Men, too Warm, Indiscreet, and Unpractis'd in Business, to be sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ely trusted together? and were they indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the Liberty they claim, would soon ruin themselves by the use of it? These are Dr. <hi>W's</hi> Thoughts upon the matter; and are they not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ones? This is not only oppressing, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting Men; the Reason given for the Usage is more provoking than the Usage it self.</p>
            <p>If, under a Sense of these Injurys, I have not so temper'd my Pen every where, but that an Hard Word may now and then have escap'd me, I need no Excuse for it. Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s way of Dealing would, I am sure, have justify'd much rougher Returns than any I have made him. But what ever of this kind the Reader meets with, he may assure himself that it sprung not from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the least mixture of <hi>Private Prejudice,</hi> or <hi>Resentment.</hi> For I have no Quarrel with Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> but on a Publick Account. On the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Good Services he did against Popery en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd me always to wish well to him, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steem him: Or, had I wished him ill, yet I would never have taken this way of expressing it: for

            <p>Much less can I be suppected to have engag'd in this Design, out of <hi>Interest.</hi> The way to That, is not, by appearing in behalf of <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils;</hi> which (as <hi>Johannes Major</hi>

            <p>No, it is neither from these, nor any such Low Inducements as these, that I have enter'd on this Work: but from a Desire only of Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating to the Church the Use of her Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Assemblies, and of that Free Debate, which is inseparable from such Assemblys: Both which Rights were in great Danger of being lost by Popular Misapprehensions, and a Discontinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
            <p>In the management of this Argument I have chiefly had an Eye to what Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> has ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd; without neglecting however what has been offer'd on the same side from Other Pens, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by the Author of the <hi>Letter to a Member of Parliament:</hi> One, who, to do him right, saw

where the stress of the Dispute lay, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd here and there to write up to it, though, for want of fit Materials, he was not able. He has however in a Page or two of his Pamphlet said more for the Cause, than Doctor <hi>Wake</hi> has done throughout his Mighty Performance; which is really nothing more than a <hi>Series</hi> of Long, Flat, Impertinent Accounts, attended with sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Reflections; but without One wise Word spoken, or True stroke struck in behalf of his point, from the beginning of the Book to the End of it.

<pb facs="tcp:48421:14"/>
Umpire in this Controversy. By what secret Motive he was invited to Undertake this Office, he best knows; sure I am that it was not out of any Peculiar Skill or Ability he had to discharge it. Since he has gone out of his way to mix in a dispute that did not belong to him, he must excuse me if I have not gone out of mine, to avoid seeing his Mistakes; which I have taken notice of no otherwise than as the Course of my Reflections, and the Particular Matter I was upon, led me to observe them: And even at this Rate, the Crop of Errors was plentiful.</p>
            <p>My Lord of <hi>Sarum</hi> too is a Name, that the Reader will find often mention'd in these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, on the account of some Historical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes; in which if I shall seem to have acted too free a part, I must desire the Reader to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, how his Lordship justifiys himself for observing a slight Fault in Mr. <hi>Selden,</hi>
               <q>This, says he, I do not take notice of, out of any Vanity, or Humor of censuring so great a Man: my design is only to let Ingenious Persons see, that they are not to take things on trust ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sily, no not from the greatest Authors <note n="†" place="margin">

I desire to have the Benefit of this Excuse: especially since few or none of his Lordships Oversights, marked by me, are of less moment than That of Mr. <hi>Selden</hi>'s, observ'd by his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship; and some of them are of very great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence. Whereever I have dissented from his Lordship, I have done it, I hope, with Good Manners; and I have taken care every where to produce my Vouchers.</p>
            <p>If in Reply to so many Writers I have drawn this Answer out to a great length, at the same
<pb facs="tcp:48421:15"/>
time that I blame Dr. <hi>Wakes</hi> Tediousness, I hope I have more to say for my self than He had. Were I concern'd with Him alone, it would have been but the just Return of a Book for a Book; whereas He answered a Pamphlet in a Volumn.</p>
            <p>In the several parts of this Work, I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor'd to carry my Enquirys as far, and tread as surely as I well could with that Leysure, and those Opportunitys I was master of. I wish the desire of being Exact and Full in my Accounts, has not spread a Dryness sometimes over them, which may disgust Readers not us'd to Disquisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this Nature. But I could with far less Trouble have made them more Entertaining.</p>
            <p>If after all my Care, some Mistakes have crept in (as I doubt not but there have) the Reader will consider, that I am striking out Paths hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to untrodden, without Light, or Guide to direct me. Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> indeed pretended to cut a Passage through this Wood; but upon Tryal found it too full of Thorns and Bryars, to be clear'd by his Hand: and therefore <hi>went about;</hi> leaving the direct Way it self as Intricate and Entangled as he found it.</p>
            <p>As to what I have produc'd from <hi>Registers,</hi> I did not always on this occasion, consult the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginals themselves, for Reasons obvious to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; but was forc'd in several Instances to depend upon Collections, taken some time ago: in which however there will, I hope, be very little reason to tax my want of Exactness.</p>
            <p>The Copys of the <hi>Rolls of Parliament</hi> I us'd, were such as had gone through the Hands of Men very Skillful and Curious this way: Nevertheless a false <hi>Membrane,</hi> or even <hi>Year,</hi> may possibly

            <p>I have nothing further to tell the Reader, but that the Register of <hi>Henry de Estre,</hi> the Prior of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which I so often appeal to in what follows, is a Manuscript in the Hands of my Lord Bishop of <hi>Norwich;</hi> and that I have us'd the two last <hi>London</hi> Editions of <hi>M.

            <head>THE <hi>Rights, Powers</hi> and <hi>Priviledges,</hi> OF AN English <hi>Convocation</hi> STATED and VINDICATED.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Little Book which gave occasion to Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminous Answer, proposed to Consider, First, What <hi>Need</hi> there was of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation; and then, What were the <hi>Rights</hi> of the Clergy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it: Presuming, I suppose, that a Claim of Right could never come so decently from Subjects to their Prince, as after shewing, that they were under a Necessity of making that Claim. Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> who is a great Master of Method, has thought fit to change the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Questions; and to enquire first in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48421:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the matter of Right, before he allows the Point of Expedience to be Debated. I shall be forc'd to dissent from this Gentleman so of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in very concerning Points hereafter, that I will not give my self the trouble of disputing a Trifle with him here; and shall therefore take the Method He has Prescribed me. I am so fully satisfied of the Truth and Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of what I contend for, that I care not at which end of the Argument I begin.</p>
            <p>The Two great Convocation-Rights chiefly insisted on in that Paper, and endeavoured to be set aside by Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> in his Answer to it, are these:
<list>
                  <item>I. A Right of <hi>Meeting and Sitting</hi> in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation as often as a New Parliament Meets and Sits.</item>
                  <item>II. A Right of <hi>Treating and Deliberating</hi> about such Affairs as lie within their proper Sphere, and of coming to fit Resolutions upon them, without being necessitated antecedently to Qualify themselves for such Acts and Debates by a License under the Broad Seal of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Indeed these Rights of the Clergy do, at present, lie under some Disadvantage; both, because they have not, of late years, been duly Claimed and Exercised; and because Some even of the Clergy themselves have freely given them up, and publickly owned and maintained the Church to be at the Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Mercy of the Crown in these Particulars. But, whatever Prepossessions Men may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on this account; yet, if the Cause may be
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:48421:18"/>
allowed a fair Hearing, I doubt not but in the following Papers clearly to prove, That the Church's Rights are, in both these Instances, plain and indisputable; and that therefore, whatever Concessions some of her Unwary or Designing Members may have made to her Prejudice, they must be accounted for on some other Bottom, beside that of the mere force of Truth; and how silent soever She her self may have been in the Vindication of these Rights, yet the reason of that silence was not, because she had nothing to say.</p>

               <head>CHAP. I.</head>
               <p>THE Way in which I intend to proceed, is, First, To <hi>State</hi> and <hi>Confirm</hi> the Two Points in Question, shewing upon each of them, wherein the Right claim'd seems to consist, and what I take to be the chief Evidences and Proofs upon which it is founded. After this I shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the <hi>Exceptions</hi> of all sorts that have been taken to this Claim by Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> or any other Writer, who has appeared on the same side; particularly by the Author of the <hi>Letter to a Member of Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the first of the Two Points, in order to give our selves a clear Account, What the present Right is, it will be requisite to step back a little, and enquire, What the former Usage has been; What the Custom of this particular Church and Realm in relation to such Assemblies; And what also the general Practice of the Church of God in all Ages.</p>
               <p>A <hi>Convocation,</hi> or <hi>Provincial Synod,</hi> (for so we now use the Word) may be considered, either <hi>Simply in it self,</hi> or as <hi>Attendant on a Parliament.</hi> I shall take these Two several Views of it; and the first of them in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Chapter.</p>
               <p>That such Assemblies have been held fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently from the very beginning of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and under Heathen Emperors, appears abundantly from <hi>Eusebius</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">L. 5. c. 23, 24.</note>, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>

                  <hi>Tertullian.</hi> They were necessary for deciding the Differences that might happen between
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48421:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
one Diocese and another, or between those of the same Diocese, if they could not be compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed at home; for the maintenance of sound Doctrine, and wholsome Discipline, and for the promoting of the general good of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stianity.</p>
               <p>The Authoritative part of these Meetings was compos'd of the <hi>Bishops</hi> and <hi>Presbyters,</hi> who <hi>sat</hi>; <note n="*" place="margin">

                  </note> the <hi>Bishops</hi> (in a Semi-circle) formost, and the <hi>Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> behind them; before whom the <hi>Deacons</hi> and the <hi>People stood,</hi> being little more than Witnesses of what pass'd at the Synod.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Presbytery</hi> were in every City, a neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary standing Council to their respective <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi>; (whose Power in the Church was much like that of a King in one of our mix'd Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies:) and together with their Bishops therefore they met in a <hi>Diocesan Synod,</hi> upon all great Causes; and without their Advice and Consent, nothing of Importance was, or could be determin'd. This was the settl'd Rule of the Primitive Church, and was kept up to here in <hi>England,</hi> when it had declin'd almost every where else; as the Constitutions of <hi>Egbert</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Can. 44, 45, 46, 47, apud <hi>Spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi> Conc. T. 1. p. 258.</note> Arch-Bishop of <hi>York,</hi> made in the middle of the Eighth Century, declare. And some Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of this Ancient Discipline are yet visible in those <hi>Capitular Bodies</hi> planted in our <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Churches</hi>; who, as they were Originally intended to be a <hi>Select Presbytery</hi> to the Bishop for all the Affairs of his Diocese; so have they still a Restraint upon his Authority in several Cases, by the known Customs of this Church, and Laws of the Realm.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:48421:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>Some of their <hi>Presbyters</hi> the Bishops were oblig'd to carry along with 'em to the <hi>Council of the Province</hi>; and there, I say, they Sat, Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated, and Voted upon all Matters that came before the Assembly. Indeed to <hi>General</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, the Inferior Clergy came not ordinarily in their Own Right; but as the Proxy's only of absent Bishops: which was necessary to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der those Meetings from being too numerous, and to prevent Confusion. However, even the Bishops that were present in General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, were deputed thither by Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods; <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>In one of these Provincial Synods, held in the Second or Third Century, was that, which is since call'd the 37th Apostolick Canon fram'd; which orders, that there shall be two of these Assemblies yearly, one in Spring, and the other in Autumn.

               <p>In the course therefore of our Provincial Synods, the Inferior Clergy's Consent was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and not that of the Suffragans only. But still, as we may observe, the Archbishop alone is said to <hi>Decree and Ordain</hi>; which is a stile of Authority peculiar to him Here, and beyond what belonged Originally to his Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.

And as these, at the end of every Session of Parliament, were used to be Enacted by the King; so the Provincial Constitutions were published on the last Day of the Synod, by the Archbishop.

and Executed; as Acts of Parliament were ordered to be Proclaimed, by the <hi>Comes</hi> at first, and since by his Vicar-General the Sheriff.</p>
               <p>This was the manner of holding Councils, and making Canons; neither was it necessary to have the King's, or Pope's leave, to hold the one; nor was their Authority requisite for Decreeing the other. The Clergy were only to take care that they did not exceed their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits, either in the Matter or Manner of their Decrees, and that their Constitutions were such, as would not be Revoked and Annulled by either of those Supreme Powers.</p>
               <p>The Metropolitans were by the Canons (and by the <hi>Roman</hi> Law <note n="*" place="margin">Nov. 123. c. 10.</note> where it had force) <hi>Oblig'd</hi> to call those Synods Yearly.

               <p>'Tis true the Archbishop called them some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at the King's Instance, signified to him by a Royal Writ: Yet even then, not in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

'Tis in this case, as in that of our great Lay Conventions, the Assembling of which is not only part of the Prince's <hi>Prerogative,</hi> but of the Subjects <hi>Right</hi>; and matter of Duty as well to those who Call, as those who are Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to them; and would oblige therefore, though there were no positive Law that fixed the times of such Meetings.</p>
               <p>Indeed Either of these Assemblies, in State, or Church, may sometimes have been intermitted for emergent Reasons, and such as the Members themselves that compos'd 'em might be presumed willing to allow; yet those Intermissions must not be supposed to take away the Right of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, except they are withal suppos'd to take away the Right of Convening. So that the Provincial Inferiors may well demand to be Assembled, as soon as those Reasons Impedient shall cease; and much more, when stronger Reasons shall arise on the other side, such as would justify the Clergy's desire of an extraordinary Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they had not an ordinary one to claim.</p>
               <p>And among many other Reasons which may occasionally move Inferiors to claim the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continuance of these Meetings, this may be one, That their Right begins to be questioned by the Discontinuance; especially if the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:48421:29"/>
shall take care to assert his Own, at the same time that he sets aside Theirs; and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to Come, shall yet not suffer them to Assemble in Form; nor let them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of being a Convocation Legally to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer together, and to frame their Requests to their Lordships, the King, or Parliament, be so much as a <hi>Congregation,</hi> once to say their Prayers together, and hear a Sermon.</p>
               <p>Now as it is manifest that this Right of As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembling is Attested by the usage of our Church, and founded upon the Canon Law; so may it be remembred, that it is no <hi>Papal</hi> Grant, but derived from very ancient Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Practice, established by the great Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> and other succeeding General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and adopted particularly into the Body of the Canons of Most (I might say, All) Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Nations. The Disuse, indeed, and Suppression of Synods, has been frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged upon the Arbitrary Proceedings of the Papacy; but no Primate need fear lest he should be thought to take too much of the <hi>Legatus Natus</hi> upon him, if he pleases to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene them.</p>
               <p>For so far are the Clergy of <hi>England</hi> from being Unreasonable or Singular in their Desire of such Meetings, that there is no part of the Reformed Church beside, that does not duly hold them. They are constantly kept up in the <hi>United Provinces;</hi> and even in <hi>France</hi> they were never denied the Protestants by this King, as long as the use of their Religion was allowed them: These Assemblies having been always esteemed by all Christians as the best and most proper means for the Preservation of
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:48421:29"/>
Unity, and suppression of Errors and Disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Church of God.</p>
               <p>To draw nearer home; what we plead for has been allow'd the present <hi>Scotch Kirk</hi>; nay, and something more than we plead for. I hope it will not be thought foreign to my Subject, if I stop to give some short account of it. Their <hi>Assembly</hi> has sat often since the Revolution, and done business, with a witness: if a thorough purging of Churches, and Universities; if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercising their Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction over the whole Kingdom (as well over those who renounc'd their Government, as those who own'd it) be, doing Business. If to Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, Suspend, and Deprive at Pleasure; if to be Patrons General of all the Livings of the Kingdom, and to Induct, as well as to E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject what Persons they thought fit; if by an <hi>Act</hi> of theirs (for so the Style runs) to appoint National Fasts, and to settle General Rules for Church-Discipline and Government, without so much as asking leave of the Civil Power, be doing Business, then, I say, the <hi>Scotch As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly</hi> have within these ten years last past effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually done it. They have acted up to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most Extent of their pretended Divine Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Priviledges, and have scarce been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood in any one Branch of it: for tho' the King's Commissioner has sat with them, yet has he not been allow'd either to interpose in their Debates, or to have a Negative upon their Resolutions; no nor so much as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them. And when he pretended to adjourn or dissolve the Synod, they protested against it; and appointed a New Meeting by their own, without any regard to His Authority:
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:48421:30"/>
and in the Intervals of their Sessions they have had a standing Committee of their Members, who have been, as it were, a <hi>Perpetual Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</hi> These are the High Favours and Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences, that have with a Liberal Hand been bestow'd on our Neighbours in <hi>Scotland</hi>; to the utter Abolishment almost of the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates Supremacy in Church-Affairs. Shall they who deny the Prince his Due, have more than their Due allow'd them? and shall not those have so much as their Due, who allow him every thing that either the Law of God, or the Law of the Land allows him? Shall not the modest Claim of an <hi>Episcopal Church,</hi> which professes all due Subjection to the State, put in for as fair an Hearing, as the Unreasonable Pretensions of an <hi>Holy Kirk,</hi> that acknowledges no Superior but <hi>Christ Iesus?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor have those of the <hi>Presbyterial</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational</hi> way been less indulg'd here at home: for that They too have their <hi>Convocation</hi> in as Regular and Full, tho' not in so open a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as the Members of the Church of <hi>England</hi> desire to have, appears from that Circular Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which about Eighteen Months ago was issu'd out, and casually came into an Hand that it did not belong to. The World has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready had a sight of it: however it may not be amiss once more to Print it in these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers <note n="*" place="margin">See the Append. N. II.</note>.</p>
               <p>Nay the Priviledge we claim is not deny'd to any the most Wild and Extravagant Sect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us: even <hi>Quakers</hi> themselves have their Annual Meetings for Ecclesiastical Affairs; and are known to have, and allow'd to hold them. Shall Schism and Enthusiasm (to say no worse)
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:48421:30"/>
have the free Liberty of these Consults, for the Propagation of their Interests? and shall an Apostolick and Establish'd Church want it? God forbid!</p>
               <p>In <hi>Popish</hi> Countries indeed these Synods are discountenanc'd, and out of use; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing the late Decree of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> which orders that they shall be Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted once at least in three years. But this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree stands in the Acts of that Council to no other purpose, than as it is a Testimony of the sense that even that Corrupt Body of Men had of the necessity of these Assemblies; for the force of it vanished almost as soon as it was made: The Undersharers in Spiritual Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on secretly agreeing to lay it asleep; and his Holiness (who alone can awaken it) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niving at their Neglect; because the less such Meetings as these obtain in the Church, the greater recourse will there be to his Chair, and his Empire will be the more Absolute.</p>
               <p>In <hi>France,</hi> particularly, though this Decree has been Authorized by the Edict of <hi>Blois,</hi> and by several others, yet have there not been any <hi>Provincial Synods</hi> held in virtue of it for above these Threescore and Ten Years last past; that is, ever since the Council of <note n="*" place="margin">An. 1624.</note> 
                  <hi>Bourdeaux</hi>; unless we should call that Meeting of a few Prelates the other Day, to Condemn the Archbishop of <hi>Cambray</hi>'s Book, a <hi>Provincial Council</hi>: And, if I mistake not, they called themselves so; by the same Figure, as my Lords the Bishops, who are of the Commission for Ecclesiastical Preferment, may be stiled a <hi>Convocation.</hi>

               <p>THus does our Right to these Assemblies stand by the <hi>Law Ecclesiastical</hi>: Which Law has been consider'd by it self, for the clearer Evidence of the Argument, and not in any opposition to the Temporal Government: It not following from hence that such Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies should be held, contrary to the Will of the Sovereign Power; but that the Sovereign Christian Power should be desired to permit, or rather to encourage them: If in this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest we were not already prevented by the Law of the Land, which not only allows, but commands them; as will appear, if, as hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto I have enquir'd only into the Rights of a <hi>Synod of the Province of</hi> Canterbury <hi>at large,</hi> so I go on now to consider it as <hi>Attendant upon a Parliament</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> For so the matter at present stands, and has stood for 400 Years and upwards; to speak at the lowest: Tho' in the Elder Ages it plainly enough appears, that the Clergy came at once from both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and joined Nationally with the Lay Assembly.</p>
               <p>That this was the usage of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Reigns is acknowledg'd from the remaining Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48421:31"/>
of those Times: But what the Order of these National Assemblies was, is not, as I see, yet clearly discover'd. As therefore the most knowing and exact of our Antiquaries have thought it proper, for the better understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Government, to go over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Germany,</hi> and consult the Laws and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of those Places from whence we came; so possibly we might not be much out of our way in this Argument, if we looked into <hi>France,</hi> and enquir'd how the <hi>Franks</hi> there govern'd themselves; those <hi>Fellow-Germans,</hi> and near Neighbours of our Ancestors; and who had much about the same time possessed themselves of <hi>Gaul,</hi> as these had of this part of <hi>Britain</hi>; especially if we consider the times of <hi>Charles the Great,</hi> that Renown'd and Mighty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; whose Example, had it vary'd from the Common Original Practice, would yet proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have been imitated by our Lesser Kings.</p>
               <p>And here we may content our selves with what the judicious <hi>De Marca</hi> reports to us of this matter in his Excellent Work <hi>De Concordiâ Sacerdotii &amp; Imperii</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">L.VI. c. 24, 25.</note>: That in King <hi>Pepin</hi>'s time, when the Kingdom began to recover it self from the Disorders it suffer'd before, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solv'd that two National Ecclesiastical Synods should be held every Year; the One in <hi>March</hi> in the King's presence, and where-ever he should appoint; the other in <hi>October,</hi> at the Place where the Bishops, in their former Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing should agree upon. That whereas this last was a pure Ecclesiastical Council, the other was a Royal One, to which the Great Men of the Kingdom resorted from all Parts of it, to take their Resolutions for the succeeding Year:
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48421:32"/>
As there was also towards the Winter, another Royal, but Privy Council, consisting only of the Great Ministers, and such others as the King thought fit to call; in which Matters, were prepared, and digested into Heads, to be proposed to the Greater Assembly in the Spring.</p>
               <p>This General Convocation of the Spiritualty and Laity, which was after by <hi>Pepin</hi>'s Son, <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, appointed to meet on the first of <hi>May,</hi> was call'd indifferently <hi>Conventus, Fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citum, Concilium, Synodus,</hi> or <hi>Colloquium</hi>; and in Latter Times, <hi>Parliamentum,</hi> which word also is still retained. In it the Clergy and Laity deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berated sometimes together, and sometimes apart, according as the nature of the Business to be treated of was; whether purely Secular, Ecclesiastical, or mixt. When they were apart, as well as when together, the Great Persons; Earls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were distinguish'd from those of a lower Degree; sitting by themselves, and on Honourable Seats. These too manag'd the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and formed the Conclusions: the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moners assenting, and sometimes speaking; but so, as rather to signifie their Opinion, than give a Vote. This we may suppose to have been the Method also on the Spiritual side: And so <hi>Hincmar</hi> (out of <hi>Adalbardas</hi> Cousin and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor to this <hi>Charles</hi>) expresses it. <note n="*" place="margin">Ad Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceres pro Institutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:48421:34"/>Thus our Church Then held her Synods concurrently with the Lay-Councils; not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed according to the strict Letter of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons (for both Provinces Assembled together) but so however, as to satisfy the Intent of them, and to prevent other Synods, that were purely Provincial, from Assembling so often as they should, and would otherwise have done.

               <p>The <hi>Norman</hi> Revolution made no change in this respect: for though the Conqueror is known to have divided the Court of the <hi>Bishop</hi> and <hi>Earl,</hi> who before mix'd Jurisdictions; yet he continued still to Assemble the Clergy Nationally with the Laity, here as in <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy</hi>

no doubt in greater Numbers, at his more full and general Assemblies of all the States of the Realm. At such only, Church-Affairs seem to have been Transacted; not at his Ordinary <hi>Curiae,</hi> (though some of the Clergy of all Ranks might be present there:) unless when these <hi>Curiae,</hi> and those great Councils were co-incident, and the latter Summoned to meet extraordinarily at the same time that the former met acourse. As the Case was in that mixt Convention at <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chester,</hi> where <hi>Stigand</hi> was Deprived; and in another at <hi>Gloucester,</hi> where several Bishops were made.</p>
               <p>How long exactly the <hi>Saxon</hi> Manner of Mix'd Councils continued, is not easy to say. However that for several Reigns after the Conquest it obtained, is certain; and it is probable, that the Disuse of it might begin toward the middle of <hi>H.</hi> II. when the Clergy, we are told, <hi>Disjoined</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves from the Laity <note n="‖" place="margin">Post Turonense Concilium (<hi>which was in</hi> 1163. <hi>about the Time of the Council of</hi> Clarendon) cum Omnibus penè in Rebus Clerus se a Populo disjunxisset.

               </p>
               <p>And this Division of the Spiritualty from the Temporalty, which began in <hi>H.</hi> the IIds. time, took Root under his Successors, and was settled more and more by the Absence of <hi>Richard</hi> the First in the <hi>Holy Land,</hi> by King <hi>Iohn</hi>'s weak, and <hi>H.</hi> the IIIds. troubled Reign.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:48421:35"/>Now therefore the Clergy seem to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clin'd Obedience to the Lay-Summons; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept such of them only as were oblig'd to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Great Councils of the Realm by their <hi>Offices,</hi> or their <hi>Tenures</hi>; so that in the Sixth of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> when the King had a mind to have all the Abbots and Priors present in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he was forced to Cite them by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Bishops of the Dioceses <note n="*" place="margin">Cl. 6.

               <p>To this Recess a way had been before open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Dispute between the Two Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litans, <hi>Thurstan</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> refusing that Subjection to the See of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> which had been paid to it by his Predecessors from <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franks</hi> time; when in a great Council (held first at <hi>Winchester,</hi> and then at <hi>Windsor</hi>) it was solemnly determined, That the Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> and his Clergy, should attend the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Conciliary Meetings and Summons <note n="‖" place="margin">Diceto de Archi.

And now therefore, the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi>'s Authority being confined to his own Province, and the Interest of the Crown in calling the Body of the Clergy together, afterwards lessening apace; the Affairs of the Church came at length to be transacted in Two separate Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, and the Clergy seldome to Assemble <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally,</hi> but at the Command of a Legate; who
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:48421:36"/>
often called them together in <hi>H.</hi> the IIId's Reign; and that (to bring the Observation nearer to my Subject) at the very time of Parliament: And sometimes I find, that both the Regal and Legantine Authority joined in Convening them. <note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>But their ordinary way of attending the Parliament, was not in one National Council, but in two separate Assemblies of the Province, as is manifest from the Constitution of <hi>Reading</hi> formerly Cited; where Two Proctors are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be sent from every Diocese, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear <hi>in proximâ Congregatione nostrâ tempore Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamenti proximi</hi>

               <p>But this Wise and High-spirited Prince, finding the Clergy thus divided from the Laity, and from one another, hard to be dealt with, resolved to restore the old Practice, and to bring them Nationally to Parliament; which he did, by inserting into the Bishop's Writ that Clause which begins with the word <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munientes,</hi> and Summoning by the means of it, all the Secular Clergy under Bishops, either in Person, or by their Proxy's; as also those Religious, who were so far Secular as to be Chapters to the Bishops, and placed in the Heads of the several Dioceses; such as the Priors and Convents of <hi>Canterbury, Winchester, Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cester,</hi> &amp;c. were.

to be out of the World, had the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege also of being left out of those Summons; the Crown contenting it self to direct particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Writs to all the great Abbots and Priors, whether holding by Barony or not; without commanding the Attendance of their Convents.</p>
               <p>The Numbers of the Lower Clergy Cited by the Archbishop to his Parliamentary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations had born some proportion all along to those of the Lower Laity called at the same time to Parliaments <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>This Clause, how much soever to the real Interest and Advantage of the Lower Clergy, was yet thought a Burthen by them, and an inroad upon their Priviledges; and they tried all ways therefore of withstanding or declining it; but in vain: for the Genius of that mighty Monarch, who was not us'd to be baffled in any Attempt, carried it against all their Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition. And the Ground he had thus gained upon them, he kept throughout all his Reign; as appears by the Records of the last Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (but the First, whose Proxy Roll is

                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:48421:38"/>Even under the former of these Princes, though the Clergy obeyed the Parliamentary Summons duly, yet were they backward to answer the Ends of it, unless they might do it in their own Manner; and therefore referred themselves more than once to a Fuller Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Province, to be gathered by the Archbishop; where they knew they should be join'd by All the Religious, and by Their help be enabled either better to put off the Burthen that might be laid upon them, or bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to bear it.</p>
               <p>His easy Successor was prevailed with yet further, to mix Authorities, and to take the Archbishop's Power along with him in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening them; so that under him the way was often, when the Bishop's Writ with the Clause <hi>Premunientes</hi> went out, to send Two other Writs to the Two Metropolitans, directing them to cite Those [and Those Only] of their Province by a general Mandate, which were Summon'd severally by the Bishops Writs. But because this, though a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descention of the Crown, was still an Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship upon the Archbishop, out of whose Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Parliament was held, who could not regularly bring his Subjects to any place not within his Jurisdiction; and because it was known to be more agreeable to the Rules of the Church, and found to be more conducive to the Peace of the State <note n="*" place="margin">

this Accommodation afterwards took place; That the <hi>Premunientes</hi> should still Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon them from the King to meet <hi>Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily,</hi> but that sufficient Obedience should be understood to be paid to it, if the Clergy met <hi>Provincially,</hi> though not at the same <hi>Place,</hi> yet about the same Time, and to the same Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, to be ready to hear what should be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed from the King; to give their Advice when ask'd, and their Consent when requisite; to offer their Aids, and their Petitions; and, in short, to answer the necessary Affairs of the King and Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Not that the Clause <hi>Premunientes</hi> now grew useless and insignificant: for still the Bishop (who executed the Royal Writs upon the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the Diocese, as the Sheriff did upon the Laity of the County) when he received his Summons to Parliament, transmitted it to those of the Lower Clergy concern'd; and they still made their returns to it: Such of them as were not to Attend in Person, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mally Impowering their Proctors to Appear and <hi>Consent</hi> for them in <hi>Parliament,</hi> according to the Tenor of the Bishops Writ; though those Proctors sat afterwards and acted in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation.</hi> An instance of such a <hi>Procuratorium</hi> for the <hi>Parliament,</hi> I have seen as low as 1507. and another of an execution of the <hi>Premunien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> by the Bishop; yet lower in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth; though Returns had then Ceas'd, or at least were not Enter'd. Thus the Forms were kept up, and by that means the King's Right of Summoning the Clergy asserted and owned: And, so the State-ends of Summoning them were also answered, they
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:48421:39"/>
were left to do it in an Ecclesiastical way; and to attend the Parliament and the Business of it, not in One Body, as they were called, but in Two Provincial Assemblies. This they did at first by the <hi>Connivance</hi> of the Crown, rather than any express <hi>Allowance</hi>; the Archbishop of his own accord sending out a Provincial Cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion concurrently with the Bishops Writs of Summons; which Method obtaining, and these Meetings of the Province being tacitly accepted in lieu of the Clergy's resort to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; it grew necessary for the King to employ his Authority also in Convening them; for otherwise it had been at the Archbishop's Discretion, whether he would have any such Meetings or not; and so the Crown might have lost the Clergy's Assistance in Parliament. This gave birth to the custom of issuing out Two Convocation-Writs, when a New Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to be Chosen; which though set on foot before, yet settled not into a Rule till some Years after <hi>Edward</hi> the Third was in the Throne; and then it was practised as duly and regularly, and in much the same manner as it is at this day: Take one Instance (and that not the Earliest which might be given) instead of many.</p>

               <p>If we supply this Record with the Writs extant on the Back of the Roll, it will appear that the Clergy were Summoned here just as they are now, by the Archbishop, at the King's Order, or <hi>Letter of Request,</hi> as it was then deemed and <note n="†" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>We shall find also, that the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> had a Writ for That Province, as the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had for This; only he was to Convene his Clergy about a Fortnight Later, than the other Province met <note n="†" place="margin">

And in this the way then taken varied a little from Modern Practice, which has made those Two Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings perfectly Coincident. But the ancient Usage was, for the Clergy of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble first, in order to set the President, which it was expected that the other Province should almost implicitly follow: and with reason; since, if the Two Provinces had continued to attend the Parliament in One Body, as they did of Old, the <hi>York</hi> Clergy would have had no Negative upon the Parliamentary Grants of the Clergy; being a very unproportioned part of the Assembly. When therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:48421:40"/>
to Meet and grant Separately, the Crown had reason to expect, that what the greater Province did, should be a Rule to the less, or otherwise not to have consented to their Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Very early in the Rolls therefore this Passage occurs,
<q>That the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and other Nobles [the King's Commissioners in his absence] should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> to contribute for the Defence of the <hi>North,</hi> as They [<hi>i. e.</hi> I suppose, as the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and his Clergy] had done <note place="margin">13 E. 3. n. 18.</note>.</q>
And even in <hi>Church Acts,</hi> as well as <hi>State Aids,</hi> what had passed the one, was held to be a kind of Law to the other; so that in 1463 we find the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of <hi>York</hi> adopting at once all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions made by that of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and as yet not receiv'd <note n="†" place="margin">Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. quòd Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lati &amp; Clerus in Convocatione 1463.

               <p>And as the time of the Convocation of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>'s assembling was, in this and in most o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Ancient Instances different from that of her Sister Province; so was it, we see, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent also from that of Parliament. Here it preceded, <note n="‖" place="margin">Seven Days.</note> but generally it followed the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament a Week or two; on purpose, as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that the Bishops and Parliamentary
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48421:41"/>
Abbots might be at leisure to attend both those Meetings. And this was the usual Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance throughout <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> the Second's Reigns, till <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth began to enlarge it; in and after whose time the Clergy held their Assemblies during, and near the Sessions of Parliament, but not tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly concurrent with them; the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop it seems, affecting Independency, and the King, who above all things desir'd to stand well with the Clergy, favouring him and them in that respect; and giving way to their being call'd later, or dismiss'd sooner than the Laity, as having been already answer'd in his Demands, at that, or some other Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of the Province, call'd out of Parliament-time: Such Assemblies being frequent in those days, and transacting all Affairs that belong'd even to Parliamentary Convocations.</p>
               <p>But this was only an Interruption of the Old Practice for a time, not a through alteration of it: for about the Entrance of the last Age, when the Prerogative began to recover the Ground it had lost to the Church, we find these Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Clergy and Laity more closely u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited; the Dates of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation being all one, or a few days before, or after, (if not altogether the same with) those of his Parliaments: And from 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. to this Reign the Clergy have, I think, met al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways and parted within a day of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the day it self on which the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment sat and rose, being not judg'd so proper for this purpose, because the Bishops were then to attend the House of Lords. But since the late Revolution, the Business of these Two
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48421:41"/>
Meetings not interfering, the same day has serv'd to open both of 'em; or rather to open the one, and shut up the other. There have been no Deviations from this Rule that I know of, except in a Legatin Synod or two; (which are no Presidents) and once in the <hi>Convocation</hi> of 1640: but that Experiment succeeded too ill to be ever try'd a Second Time.</p>
               <p>The Clergy therefore, tho' by a Mistake in their Politicks separated from the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet continu'd still to attend it, in Two Provincial <hi>Assemblies,</hi> or <hi>Convocations</hi>: which, as they met for the same Purpose, and had the same <hi>Reasons of State</hi> inserted into their Writs of Summons, as the Parliament had; so did they (to manifest yet more their Origin and Ally<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) keep closely up to the Forms, and Rules, and Manner of Sitting, and Acting, practis'd in Parliament. I cannot do right to my Subject, without pointing out several Particulars, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this Conformity was preserv'd; and I shall not therefore, I hope, be misinterpreted in doing it.</p>
               <p>The Two Houses of Parliament sat together Originally; and so therefore did the Two Houses of <hi>Convocation:</hi> of which, to omit o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proofs, I shall mention that only which may be drawn from the Inferior Clergy's being sent as Delegates from the Bishops to represent, and act for 'em in <hi>Convocation:</hi> an Usage, which tho' practis'd long after the Greater Prelates divided from the Less, yet must, in all Probability, have had its Rise, when they were together; as the like Custom also in Parliament had: whither the Lords Spiritual and Temporal being us'd to send
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:48421:42"/>
Commoners to Vote for them, while the States were together, continu'd the Practice also, long after they were asunder; as appears, on the Spiritual Side, by Numerous Instruments of Proxy, yet remaining in the Bishops Registers; and, on the Temporal, by some Probable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences of Mr. <hi>Elsyng</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 5. p. 126.</note>; tho' Direct Proofs of it are, together with the Proxy Rolls, lost <note n="†" place="margin">

               <p>The <hi>Prolocutor</hi> was so chosen, as the Speaker, by the Body, whose Mouth he was; so pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to the Archbishop, and confirm'd by him, as the other was by the King.

But this Conjecture contradicting not only the Records of the Convocations in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Reign (to which my <hi>Lord</hi> applys it) but all the Elder Accounts of our Synods in the Archbishop's Registers; where the Deans, and Archdeacons are said always, as now, to sit together with the Proctors of the Clergy; I am sorry, that I cannot fall in with it: the rather, because it would give me an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of adorning these Rude Collections with something drawn from his <hi>Lordship</hi>'s Exacter

Works, and of making him my Publick Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments for it.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Lordship</hi> would perhaps have omitted this Guess, had he consider'd, that the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Assemblies of the Clergy were (as I have shewn) in lieu of that Parliamentary Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance which the Crown challeng'd by the <hi>Premunientes</hi>; and their Session therefore in Two Houses was adapted to the Parliamentary Summons: so that between Them and the Laiety the Parallel in this respect ran, that, as all of the Laiety who were Summon'd <hi>singly</hi>

               <p>But enough of this:—I return to those Marks of Resemblance which were between the Parliament and Convocation long after they separated; and by which, as by some
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:48421:44"/>
common Ensigns of Honour, the One of these may be plainly discern'd to be of the same Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and Descent, as it were, with the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The Instruments impowering the Proctors of the Clergy to act for the several Dioceses were drawn up, I have said, in the same Form almost with those for the Knights of Shires. I add, that they had equally <hi>Wages</hi> from those they represented: and those Wages were laid on the Diocese with the same Distinction that the Others were on the County; all such as came Personally to Parliament, either as Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellors, or Assistants, being excus'd from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to em: not to descend to yet minu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Differences, which were still on both sides alike observed</p>
               <p>And which is very Material, the Proctors enjoying these Expences, are in the Writs and Records of that time expresly said to be entitled to 'em, on the account of their Service <hi>in Parliament</hi>: tho', strictly speaking, they sat not in Parliament; but only, as they do now; in a Convocation held concurrently with it. Of which I will stop to give the Reader here two very significant Instances: the One is, of a Discharge which the Abbat of <hi>Leicester</hi> obtain'd from Personal Attendance on the Parliament, on condition, as the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent speaks, <hi>Quod dictus Abbas &amp; successores sui in Procuratores ad hujusmodi Parliamenta &amp; Concilia per Clerum mittendos consentiant, &amp;, ut moris est, expensis contribuant eorundem</hi>

                  </note> and is founded upon it.</p>
               <p>And that the Levy of these Expences conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd throughout the succeeding Reigns, to the very time of the Reformation, I have seen a good Proof, in a certain Bishop's Mandate <note n="†" place="margin">Anno 1543.</note>, for collecting a Peny in the Pound to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose: which, it says, <hi>De laudabili legitiméque praescriptâ Consuetudine—in qualibet Convocatione hujusmodi contribui solebat, &amp; solet, &amp; ex aequitate, consideratis praemissis, debet.</hi> How long after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards they were paid, or when first disconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nu'd, I know not; but suppose, that the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use of them, as to the Deputed Clergy, might come on by much the same steps, and about the same time that it did in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</p>
               <p>In one thing however the Clergy Delegates differ'd from those of the Laity; that the first, tho' Proxys themselves, could, upon occasion, appoint other Proxys in their stead, if their Instruments ran, <hi>Cum potestate substituendi alium Procuratorem,</hi> as they often anciently did <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>And some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of late: for</hi> 1 E. 6. <hi>One of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors for the Clergy of</hi> Hereford <hi>appointed Two others in his room.</hi> [<hi>See</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodalia.] <hi>And in his last Year the</hi> Procuratorium <hi>for the Dean and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of</hi> Paul<hi>'s had that Clause in it: for so it stands enter'd in Bishop</hi> Ridley's <hi>Register. Fol.</hi> 294.</note>.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48421:45"/>
Whereas I find no Instance, that this was ever practis'd among the Commons: The reason of which I conceive to be, that the Clergy were to attend the Call, not only of the King in his Parliaments, but of the Pope, and the Archbishop also in their several Synods; and having therefore a Greater Burthen in this respect than the Laity, were indulged also a Greater Liberty.</p>
               <p>Further, the Members of Convocation had not only Parliamentary <hi>Wages,</hi> but <hi>Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Priviledges</hi> too; and those, I question not, from their first Separation: tho' we find, that they were solemnly setled upon them, long afterward, in the 8 <hi>H.</hi> 6. But that Act might be made, as well to affirm the Old Priviledges, which, after the Clergy had been dismembred so long, might begin to be disputed; as to add the New, which had accru'd, since the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: and withal to confer them both, not only on Parliamentary Convocations, but on Convocations in general, whenever meeting at the King's Summons.</p>
               <p>Nor was the Separation so compleat, but that the Inferior Clergy joyn'd Occasionally with the Laity, and attended the King together with the States of Parliament; either at the first Opening, or Dissolution of it, or at other solemn times, when the King came to the House of Lords, and something was to be done <hi>en plein Parlement, i. e.</hi> in a Full Assembly of the Clergy and Laity, as that Expression some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the Elder Rolls seems to imply <note n="*" place="margin">6 E. 3. <hi>n.</hi> 9. <hi>Something is said to be agreed,</hi> per touz en plein Parle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>and those are thus reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the same Number,</hi>—Les Prelats, Countes, Baronns, &amp; touz les autres <hi>Somons</hi> a mesme le Parlement: <hi>which includes the Inferior Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, for They were</hi> Summon'd <hi>this time by the</hi> Premunientes. <hi>See</hi> Dugd. <hi>p.</hi>

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48421:49"/>
did not cut them off from all manner of Relation to it; but that still, after that, their <hi>Convocations,</hi> though held at a distance from the Parliament, were, in their own nature, as well as in the Acceptance of the Crown, and in the Eye of the Law, <hi>Parliamentary Assemblies.</hi>

               <p>These Parliamentary Meetings of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy were at first <hi>Congregationes,</hi> or <hi>Convocationes Cleri</hi>; but not therefore <hi>Concilia Provincialia:</hi> Which were Extraordinary Assemblies for Church Business only; for the restoring laps'd Discipline, and reforming Ecclesiastical Abuses: whereas the Others were originally held for Civil Purposes alone, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Affairs of the State.

               <p>And this Opinion also that Parliament was of, which Voted the Canons of 1640. Illegal, chiefly on this head, because they were made in an Assembly, which, though it met by the Parliament Writ, yet Sate and Acted after the Parliament was determined. Nor were they contradicted in it by the Famous Judgment given under the Hands of his Majesty's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and other Honourable Persons Learned in the Law, if the Words of that Judgment be well considered, which are these;
<q>The Convocation being called by the King's Writ under the Great Seal, doth continue, until it be dissolved by Writ, or Commission under the Great Seal, notwithstanding the Parliament be dissolved.</q>
(<hi>Troub. Try.</hi> Laud. <hi>p.</hi> 80.) Which is all very true; and yet it may be true too, that such a Writ, or Commission <hi>ought</hi> of course, to issue from the Crown, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Dissolution of the Parliament. But this Point is not touch'd upon in the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment given, and seems to have been purposely declined: For otherwise, it had been a clearer and fuller Determination of the Matter in Question, if they had said, That the King might by his Prerogative keep a Convocation sitting as long as he pleased, notwithstanding the Dissolution of that Parliament, with which it was called.</p>
               <p>I will not say, That the Parliament of 1660. were certainly of the same mind, though
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:48421:51"/>
it is probable they were; and that this was One, if not the Chief Reason, why in the Act <note n="*" place="margin">13 Car. II. <hi>c.</hi> 12.</note> Restoring Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction they so particularly, and by Name, excepted those Canons from a Parliamentary Confirmation.</p>
               <p>However that may be, sure we are, That the Convocation of the Clergy have (as has been said already) for above 150 Years in every Instance (except that of Forty, and the Synods <hi>Legatin</hi>) Met and Rose within a day of the Parliament.

               <p>And to the same purpose the Good Martyr, Archdeacon <hi>Philpott,</hi> a Member of Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and well skill'd in the Rights of it: He, in his Supplication to the King, Queen, and Parliament, complains,
<q>That where there was by the Queen's Highness a Parliament called, and <hi>after the Old Custom</hi> a Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Clergy <note n="‖" place="margin">

Nor did those Lords of the Council, who disputed other Points with him, deny this; but agreed in Terms,

I lay no great weight upon their Opinion, because it was casually given, and by Persons, who, though of the King's Privy <hi>Council,</hi> yet might, perhaps, be as Ill inform'd of these Matters as Meaner
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:48421:52"/>
Men: For a Seat at that <hi>Honourable Board</hi> does not necessarily imply a thorough knowledge of this part of our Constitution. I mention their Opinion, only to meet with Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> who has produced it on the other side with as much Gravity and Deference, as if it were a Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the Twelve Judges Assembled <note n="*" place="margin">P. 251.</note>. He had been Reading, I suppose, in that Notable Book of the Law, <hi>The Attorney's Academy,</hi> where he found it thus formally vouch'd <note n="†" place="margin">P. 221.</note>: And he thought he might safely Write after so Worthy a Pattern.</p>
               <p>To make amends for this slight Authority, I shall produce another of somewhat more force; even the Judgment of a whole Synod in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, who introduce their Petition about the Confirmation of Abby Lands to the Patentees, with this Preamble; <note n="‖" place="margin">1.2. P. &amp; M. <hi>c.</hi> 8.</note>

For unluckily it happens (to spoil Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s New Scheme) that they place the <hi>Usage,</hi> in their being <hi>more solito Congregati</hi>; not <hi>Convocati,</hi> or <hi>Summoniti</hi>; as the Word should have been, to make Their Assertion consistent with His. But alas! they knew nothing of this new Doctrine, and their Expressions therefore are not so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived as to favour it. They were then <hi>Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled</hi> in a Synod, and <hi>Acting</hi> as a Synod, when they drew up this Petition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And 'tis of a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom therefore of so <hi>Assembling</hi> and <hi>Acting</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:48421:53"/>
that they speak; and not of <hi>being</hi> only <hi>Summoned.</hi> Nor was this the Sense of the Clergy alone, but of an Whole Parliament too, which recited this Petition <hi>Verbatim</hi> in a Statute; and by that means set their Seal, as it were, to the Truth of the Suggestion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it.</p>
               <p>It would be needless after this to argue from the Old Parliamentary Practice of appointing <hi>Convocation-days</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Elsyng. <hi>p.</hi> 112.</note> upon which the Temporal Lords Adjourned, that the Parliament-Prelates might be at Liberty to Consult with the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Clergy: Of this Custom we have an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as high as the first Years of <hi>H.</hi> VIII. <hi>i. e.</hi> as high as we have any <hi>Iournals</hi> of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>To as little purpose would it be to urge the Decision of the Committee of Both Houses, 21 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. <note n="†" place="margin">Moor. <hi>Rep.</hi> p. 781.</note>; and of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, 10. <hi>Mariae</hi>

                     <hi>Hist. Ref. II.</hi> Vol. <hi>p.</hi> 252, 3.</note>; that a Clergyman could not be Chosen into that House, <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined also, That a</hi> Layman could not be of the Convocation: <hi>But in That, Practice is against them. For the Chancellor of</hi> York, <hi>though a Layman, is Now, and has been long, a Member of that Convocation: And whether</hi> Lamb <hi>and</hi> Heath (<hi>who are Mentioned as of the Convocation in</hi> 1640.) <hi>were not Mere Civilians, I leave to be consider'd.</hi> Heyl. <hi>Life of</hi> Laud. <hi>p.</hi> 438.</note> 
                  <hi>Because he was Represented in another House:</hi> Which implies, I think, that that other House was to sit concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently with the Parliament; or else I see not what force there is in the Reason given.</p>
               <p>Much less will it, perhaps, after what I have said, be thought Material to observe, that 24 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. <hi>c.</hi> 12. in Matters touching the Crown allows an Appeal within <hi>Fifteen days,</hi> to the <hi>Upper House of Convocation, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:48421:53"/>
or next insuing</hi>: which supposes this Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to Meet often, and to have its Regular and Stated Returns; as the Parliament has.</p>
               <p>These, though good <hi>Presumptions</hi> of the Truth I contend for, yet arise not up to the fulness of several of those <hi>Proofs</hi> which I have before suggested: And because they may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Cavil therefore, I hint them only, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out dwelling upon them. The Evidence al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given is sufficient to clear the Practice, as it stood 150 Years ago, and had then stood, Time out of mind. And that it has not altered <hi>since,</hi> is too well known to need a Proof: There being no Instance to be given, I believe, from the time of the Reformation down to that of our late Revolution, wherein a New Parliament has sate, for any time, without a Convocation to attend it: Nor any one Author of Note, I verily think, to be produced, throughout that Period, who has given it as his Opinion, that the Former of these Meetings might by the Law of the Realm be held without the Latter. Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> is for ought I can find, the very first Writer that has ever Taught this Doctrine; with how much Truth or Probability, the Reader by this time begins to judge, and will, in the Course of these Papers more clearly see: Wherein I hope to set the Clergy's Right to such Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current Meetings in so full and clear a Light, that as no One ever denied it before Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> so neither shall any Man of tolerable Skill, or Honesty ever Dispute it after him.</p>
               <p>I have been large upon this Head, and I fear, by reason of the variety of the Matter, somewhat confus'd: It may be proper there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:48421:54"/>
here at the close of it, to recollect the several Branches of the Proof there advanc'd: They stand in this Order.</p>
               <p>That, as far back as we have any Memoirs of the Civil or Ecclesiastical Affairs of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it appears that the Clergy and Laity Met together in the great Councils of the Realm: That this they did, in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, and for some Reigns after the Conquest, <hi>Nationally</hi>; joining closely with the Laity in Civil Debates, and taking Their Sanction along with them in all Ecclesiastical Acts and Ordinances: That they divided afterwards from the Laity, and from one another; and attended the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment not in One Body, but in <hi>Two Provincial Synods,</hi> held under their several Archbishops: That, though it does not clearly appear, when this Practice first had its Rise, yet sure we are, that it is between 4 and 500 years old, and has for so long at least, regularly obtain'd; excepting only the Interruption that was given to it by the Premunitory Clause, inserted into the Bishops Writs; which once again warn'd, and brought the Clergy Nationally to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: That a strict Compliance with this Clause was at first exacted by the Crown, and paid by the Clergy; but that they soon found ways of being released from the Rigor of it, and prevail'd upon the King to accept of their former manner of Assembling with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Two Provincial Synods, in lieu of that Closer Attendance which the <hi>Premunientes</hi> challenged; the Forms however being still kept up, by which the King's Right of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning them immediately to Parliament was declar'd all along, and their Obligation to

obey his Summons in the way it prescribed, was duly acknowledged: That these Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Assemblies, though held apart from the Parliament, yet belong'd to it; Met by the Parliamentary, no less than the Provincial Writ; and were State-Meetings, as well as Church-Synods: In them Parliamentary Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were Transacted, and Parliamentary Forms and Methods observed; the Members of them were Entitled to Parliamentary Wages, and enjoyed Parliamentary Priviledges: That the Inferior Clergy, though divided in Place from the Lower Laity, yet join'd with them often in the same Acts and Petitions, and were still esteem'd and called the <hi>Commons Spiritual</hi> of the Realm; and what They and the Prelates in <hi>Convocation</hi> did, was long after the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion spoken of in our Records, as done in <hi>Parliament:</hi> That these Parliamentary Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Clergy were held at first near the time at which the Laity met; afterwards with a Latitude: But that This Irregularity was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed before the Reformation of Religion; and their Meeting and Departing fixed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Day of the Assembling and Dismission of the Parliament; and that this Custom has now for above an Age and Half continued: That for so long therefore (not to say how much longer) the <hi>Convocation</hi> has been a word of Art, which signifies a Meeting of the Clergy in time of Parliament: That such Meetings have by All that understood our Constitution been held <hi>Necessary</hi>; Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> being the First Writer, that has ever asserted them to be <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious,</hi> and put it in the Prince's, or the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop's Power, whether they will have such Assemblies, or no.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:48421:55"/>The Result of All is This, That, if some Hundred Years Custom can make a Law, then may we, without Offence, affirm it to be <hi>Law,</hi> that the Convocation should Sit with every New Parliament: If the True Notion of a Convocation be, That it is an Assembly of the Clergy always attending the Parliament, then is it no Presumption to say, That we have the same Law for the Sitting of a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, as we have for that of a Parliament. And by this <hi>Law</hi> the Clergy (as was said be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in relation to the <hi>Canons</hi> of the Church) are not only under a <hi>Duty</hi> to attend, but have also a <hi>Right</hi> to meet; so that, as their Writs for Assembling concurrently with a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are not mere Letters of Grace and Compliment, but to be emitted <hi>ex debito Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae,</hi> and whether the Government has any thing to propose to them or no; so likewise are their Assemblies at such times to be held by the same Law, notwithstanding it may be pretended that there is no Occasion for them. For although their Consent may not be neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, nor their Advice seem wanting; yet, as they are bound to wait, if Either shall be ask'd; So may the Clergy themselves have some Informations and Remembrances to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and some Petitions to make concerning such things, as they may be supposed to take more particular notice of, or wherein they may be more peculiarly concern'd. And this Liberty and Opportunity of representing what they may think necessary, is to be esteemed by them as their great Parliamentary Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; not to be Wav'd, like the Others, for the better course of common Justice;
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:48421:55"/>
but to be Asserted and Confirmed for the Good of the whole Kingdom.</p>
               <p>Such a Liberty therefore and Opportunity is not only provided for by Canons, but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd, I say, by the Law: Both by the Law of Custom, which is the Law of Parliaments; and by Express Statute: an Act of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third appointing a Parliament, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequently</hi>

               <head>CHAP. III.</head>
               <p>HItherto we have considered only the <hi>First</hi> of the Two Points proposed, the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy's Right of Meeting and Sitting in Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as often as a New Parliament Sits: We will now address our Selves to the <hi>Second,</hi> which asserts their <hi>Right (when Met) of Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Deliberating about such Affairs as lie within their proper Sphere, and of coming to fit Resolutions upon them, without being necessitated antecedently to qualify themselves for such Acts and Debates by a License under the Broad Seal of</hi> England.</p>
               <p>That this is the Original Right of all Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Synods, incident to their nature, as such, claim'd and practised by them in all Ages of the Church, and in all Christian Countries, and in our own particularly, from the time that we have any account of our Synods, till towards the beginning of the Reformation, is so certain, as to need no Proof; and Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> therefore is never more like himself (that is, never more Absurd) than when he would insinuate the contrary <note n="*" place="margin">P. 48, 288.</note>. The only Question is, how far the Statute 25 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. has restrained this Right, and made a <hi>License</hi> from the Crown necessary? It being there En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted,
<q>That the Clergy, ne any of them should from thenceforth presume to attempt alledge, claim, or put in ure any Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or Ordinances, Provincial or Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, or any other Canons; nor should En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act, Promulge, or Execute any such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Constitutions, or Ordinances Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:48421:56"/>
by what Name or Names they may be called, in their Convocations in times coming; unless the same Clergy may have the King's most Royal Assent and License to Make, Promulge, and Execute the same.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now that the Clergy are not by this Clause ty'd up altogether from acting Synodically, is allowed generally by Those who desire most to abridge their Powers. It cannot with any shew of Reason be pretended, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, however under a Restraint by this Act, is become such a Lifeless Body, as to have neither Sense nor Motion, till Animated by a second Royal Command: Unquestiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and according to common Opinion and Practice, they have, even since this Statute, in vertue of the Writ by which they Meet, a Liberty of Addressing, as they shall see cause either with Thanks, or Requests, or other proper Representations — But it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum'd also, that they may go a great deal fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and that there is nothing in the Clause recited which hinders them even from Devising and Framing the <hi>Draught of a Canon</hi>; so it be done only in a Preparatory Way, and with Submission to the Royal Enacting Authority. This is what has been laid down in a late Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Letter to a Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Man.</hi>
                  </note>, briefly indeed, but convincingly; and with so much force of Reason, as yet has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no Reply: The Answerers of that Piece having slid over this part of it, where the Act is Explained, with a Seeming Neglect, but with a Real Distrust of their being able to say any thing to the purpose against what is there advanc'd. When they come to this
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:48421:57"/>
Point, as important as it is, they dispatch it always in hast: Even Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> can allow it but a flight mention or two, in a Work, where he finds room amply enough to discuss every thing that is not Material. But he did well to tread lightly over the Ground, which, if he had stood never so little upon it, would have gone near to have sunk under him. To make this Point yet more manifest, and not to leave the least pretence for a Cavil, I shall here resume the Proof of it; bespeaking the Candor of those Gentlemen, whose studies particularly lie this way, if, (as the general Fate is of those that Write out of their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession,) I express my self now and then a little improperly. So the Thing I aim at be but clearly made out, though my Manner of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it be not strictly according to Art, it will not concern me. I shall consider first the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion</hi> of the Act, and then the <hi>Act</hi> it self; and by a short account of the One lead the Reader into the true Sense and Meaning of the Other. <hi>Henry</hi> the VIIIth enraged both at the Pope and Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> for their Delusions in the Affair of the Divorce, resolved with the Ruin of the Cardinal to lessen the Papal Authority. And for the better effecting this Design, which could not well be accomplished, without striking a Terror into Those who were then but too much the Pope's Vassals, the Clergy; especially the Monks and Friars; he involved them All in a <hi>Premunire</hi> for submitting to <hi>Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi>'s Legatine Character, unauthorised by the Crown; not for <hi>Procuring,</hi> or <hi>making Use of Provisional Bulls,</hi> as Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> in his usual Kindness to the Memory of the Clergy, and
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:48421:57"/>
according to his deep Skill in <hi>English</hi> History has represented it <note n="*" place="margin">P. 248.</note>: Nor yet merely for Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing and Making Suit in his Courts, as a Greater Author <note n="†" place="margin">

But that which made the whole Body at once Obnoxious was, their obeying his Mandates <note n="†" place="margin">Rigida enim Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visionum Jura (<hi>says</hi> Josceline <hi>upon this occasion</hi>) non modò eos puniunt qui Romanas Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones sine Regis Licentia suscipiunt, sed qui iis <hi>parent.</hi> Ant.

               <p>The <hi>Cardinal</hi> had been a Favourite beyond Example; the Sole, and Uncontroul'd Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster of his Prince: He was at that time <hi>Lord Chancellor</hi> by the King's Commission, and had been made <hi>Legat</hi> with his Privity, and at his <hi>Special Instance,</hi> as Bishop <hi>Gardiner</hi> informs us <note n="(†)" place="margin">
                     <hi>In a Letter to the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour.</hi> Fox Vol. II. p. 2. col. 1.</note>. What he did in one Capacity, as well as in the other, was presum'd to be done by the King's Appointment; and whoever had opposed him, had certainly been crush'd by the Royal Power. The Subject neither durst, nor thought it necessary to enquire, whether He had a License from the Great Seal, who had himself the keeping it. However their Obedience to his Unlicens'd Authority was Criminal even to the Loss of Liberty and Estate: And could they in any case have vouch'd the King's Command for their Obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, the Command would have been said to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48421:58"/>
have been against Law, and no Warrant. Thus both the Clergy and Laity were unawares at the King's Mercy, and the Clergy not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to pardon <hi>Gratis</hi> (as the Laity afterwards were); but forc'd to ransome themselves by a good Round Sum <note n="*" place="margin">100000 <hi>l. for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of</hi> Canterbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, <hi>and</hi> 18840 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>d. for that of</hi> York; <hi>which was laid, as all other Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-Grants were, proportionably on the whole Clergy; as appears from the Assessments to be seen still in the Bishops Registers; particularly in that of</hi> Hereford, An. 1531. <hi>And I wonder therefore that my Lord of</hi> Sarum <hi>should say, That</hi> he had not been able to discover whether the Inferior Clergy paid their Proportion of this Tax, or not (<hi>Vol. I. p.</hi> 115.) <hi>and agen, That</hi> the Prelates had a great Mind to draw 'em in to bare a share of the Burthen, <hi>Ib. p.</hi> 114. <hi>[He speaks of the Time, after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation which made the Grant, was up.] For this was both Needless and Impracticable:</hi> Needless, <hi>because the Lower Clergy had already</hi> drawn themselves in, <hi>by consenting to the Grant in Convocation; and</hi> Impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, <hi>because if they had not, there was no way left of drawing 'em in afterwards.</hi>
                  </note> for those times, and by an Acknowledgment in Convocation, that the King was <hi>Supreme Head,</hi> together with the <hi>Submission,</hi> and <hi>Petition</hi> recited in the Preamble of the Act we are discoursing of.</p>
               <p>There the Clergy first <hi>knowledge</hi> [and the Parliament add, <hi>according to the Truth</hi>] that <hi>the Convocation is, always hath been, and ought to be Assembled by the King's Writ.</hi> Which <hi>Acknowledgment</hi> however is not <hi>according to Truth,</hi> unless understood of <hi>Parliamentary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations</hi>; that is, of those which were sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned as well by the <hi>Praemunientes,</hi> as by the <hi>Archbishop</hi>'s Mandate: And to Those therefore it must be restrain'd. And they had reason to Own and Avow this particularly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Cardinal</hi> had taken upon him to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene Legantine Synods by his own Authority frequently during his Ministry; and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly

                     <hi>As I ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from a Printed Sermon of</hi> Longland<hi>'s said to be Preached on that Day and Year,</hi> Coram Celeberri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo Conventu tùm Archiepiscoporum cùm Episcoporum caeteraeque multitudinis in Occidentalis Coenobii Sanctuario juxta Londinum. <hi>Though this Title, I confess, is somewhat Dubious.</hi>
                  </note>: And that Practice of his therefore might be oppos'd by this Declaration which prefaces the Submission.</p>
               <p>In <hi>the Submission,</hi> which follows, the Clergy <hi>promise</hi> in Verbo Sacerdotii, <hi>that they will never from henceforth presume to Attempt, Alledge, Claim, or put in Ure; Or Enact, Promulge, or Execute any New Canons, Constitutions, Ordinance Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial, or other,</hi> or by <hi>whatsoever other name they shall be called in the Convocation; unless the King's most Royal Assent and License may to them be had to Make, Promulge, and Execute the same: And that his Majesty do give his most Royal Assent and Authority in that behalf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now here are Two several Things distinctly promised in Two Different Branches of the same Sentence, divided from Each other by the Particle, <hi>Or</hi>; They will not <hi>Attempt, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, Claim, or put in Ure,</hi> that is one part of their promise; <hi>Or Enact, Promulge, or Execute,</hi> that is another. The First of these respects Canons, as <hi>already made</hi> (whether by a <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,</hi> or <hi>Domestick</hi> Authority); the Second, as <hi>to be made,</hi> here at Home: The Former part of their Assurance is given in their <hi>Private</hi> and <hi>Ministerial</hi> Capacity, in relation to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in the Spiritual Courts; the Latter in their <hi>Publick</hi> and <hi>Legislative</hi> Capacity, as they were Members of Convocation. In their
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:48421:60"/>
                  <hi>Private</hi> Capacity, as they might be either Judges, or Litigants, they promise, not to <hi>Attempt, Alledge, Claim, or put in Ure</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> not to be any ways Instrumental in acknowledging, or promoting the force of] any Canons made without the Royal Assent; such as the whole Text of the Foreign Canon Law, and all our Own <hi>Provincial</hi> and <hi>Legantine</hi> Constitutions were: In their <hi>Publick</hi> Capacity, they promise further, not to <hi>Enact, Promulge, or Execute</hi> any such Canons for the Future, unless they may have the same Royal License for it. But here is no promise couch'd in any of these words, that they will not <hi>debate about the matter,</hi> or <hi>form the Draught</hi> of a Canon, without such a License: None of the Words (<hi>Enact, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulge, or Execute</hi>] which alone relate to their Proceedings in Convocation, including any such Promise; and the only word which can be pretended to imply it, the word [<hi>Attempt</hi>] being determinnd by its Situation to signify much the same thing as <hi>Alledge, Claim, or put in Ure;</hi> and restraining the Persons promising on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as they might Act in their Private or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterial Capacity, that is, out of Convocation.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Attempt a Canon</hi> therefore must signify to <hi>put it upon tryal,</hi> or <hi>prove the force of it;</hi> and is a word of Art borrowed from the Civilians: However we need not go so far for an account of it; the very Act we are upon affording us an undeniable Instance of its being thus used: as will appear, if we consider the <hi>Petition</hi> of the Clergy which follows this <hi>Promise,</hi> and the <hi>Enacting Words</hi> in the Body of the Statute, which answer to that Petition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:48421:60"/>The <hi>Petition</hi> relates altogether to Canons <hi>already made,</hi> many of which were solely from the Pope, and many more from the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, without the Royal Assent; and the Clergy <hi>pray</hi> therefore that These may be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viewed, and their Authority Suspended, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that Review. Accordingly the Authority of all the Old Canons was suspended; or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abrogated by this Act, as appears plainly from the <hi>Proviso</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Which Dr.</hi> Wake <hi>in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Recital of the Act,</hi> [N. 4. <hi>of his</hi> Appendix] <hi>has suppressed, very disingenuously; considering of how great Significancy this</hi> Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viso <hi>is, to lead us into the true Sense of the Word</hi> Attempt <hi>in the Body of the Act.</hi>
                  </note>, at the End of it, for their being in force, till such a Review, and from the Express words of a Later Act, 37 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 17. <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Which says, That</hi> All the Decrees, Ordinances, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions [<hi>of the whole Canon Law</hi>] by a Statute made in the 25<hi>th</hi> of your most noble Reign be utterly abolish'd, frustrate, and of none effect.</note>: And this Abrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Old Canons was performed purely by those Words in the Enacting part of the Statute, that <hi>they shall not from henceforth At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, Alledge, Claim, or put in Ure:</hi> All which words therefore the Parliament used Evidently of <hi>Canons already made</hi>; and must, for that reason, have understood the word <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,</hi> in the very sense that I have given it, for <hi>putting</hi> a thing <hi>upon Tryal,</hi> or <hi>proving the force</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>No Restraint therefore is laid upon the Clergy in their <hi>Legislative Capacity,</hi> by the word, <hi>Attempt</hi> in their Promise: How far the following Words of it, [that they will not <hi>Enact, Promulge, or Execute any new Canons — unless the King's most Royal Assent and License may to them be had to Make, Promulge, and Execute the same</hi>] may be supposed to restrain them in
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:48421:61"/>
that respect, is to be the subject of our next Enquiry. The word, <hi>Make,</hi> here in the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition</hi> of the Promise must have the same Sense as the word <hi>Enact</hi> in the Promise it self, to which it plainly answers and refers: They will not <hi>Enact, Promulge,</hi> or <hi>Execute</hi> any New Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons; unless they may have the King's Assent to <hi>Make</hi> [<hi>i. e.</hi> to Enact] <hi>Promulge,</hi> and <hi>Execute</hi> the same. This is what the Phrase it self in Propriety of Speech im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies: For to <hi>Make</hi> a Canon, is the same as, <hi>Canonem Condere,</hi> to constitute it, and give it force: And so, <hi>Testamentum Condere,</hi> [to make a Will] signifies not merely to prepare the Draught of it; but to <hi>make</hi> it with the Legal Forms, and Circumstances requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site; that is, to Sign, Seal, and Publish it. But (which puts this matter quite out of dispute) the Word is in this very sense employed in Two several places of the Act it self, and can there be strain'd to no other: For in the Entrance of the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Clause there is mention of <hi>such Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, Constitutions, Ordinances as</hi> heretofore have been made <hi>by the Clergy of this Realm</hi>; and in the Last <hi>Proviso,</hi> of <hi>Canons</hi> already made, <hi>which be not contrariant to the Laws.</hi> Canons <hi>heretofore made,</hi> and Canons <hi>already made,</hi> must, I think, be such, as have been solemnly <hi>passed and Enacted,</hi> and not mere <hi>Draughts</hi> of 'em, lying ready to be pass'd: And to <hi>make</hi> a Canon therefore, does, in the sense of the Statute, signify to <hi>Enact</hi> it, and not merely to <hi>draw it up,</hi> and to <hi>form</hi> it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:48421:61"/>And this Way of Explaining the Act by it self, in the Use of the Present Phrase, is, I conceive, much more Authentick and Proper, than that which the Author of a <hi>Letter to a Member of Parliament</hi>

Were not this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of the Law driven to very hard shifts, he would never go to a Classick Author, or a Book of Divinity for the Sense of an Act of Parliament.</p>
               <p>To clear this Point yet further (if there were any Room for it, or any Need of it) I might appeal to the several Forms of Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which preceded this, that the Act recites, and were agreed to by the Clergy, but not accepted by the King; Copies of which, written in the very Hand of the time, are still preserved: And in every One of them, but the First, their Promise stands formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided, in the same manner as I also have distinguished it, into Two several Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es or Articles;<note place="margin">See Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix, N.

Submissions were, it seems, thought full enough; and they were obliged therefore to draw up a New one, wherein they promised not to <hi>Attempt, Alledge, Claim, on put in Ure</hi> the Ecclesiastical Laws then in force; but so long only, as till the King, by his Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, should have reviewed, digested, appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and Authorised them.

               <p>The Words then of the Clergy's <hi>Submission,</hi> which are in the Preamble of the Act, and have hitherto been the Subject of our enquiry,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:48421:62"/>
plainly amount to no more than this; Ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, (10) that they will not, as <hi>Private</hi> Persons look upon, or make Use of any Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons as obliging, but such only as, upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, shall have the stamp of Royal Authority given to them: Or (2<hi>dly</hi>) that in their <hi>Publick</hi> Capacity, they will not Enact or Publish any such Canons for the future, without the same Royal Assent and Approbation.</p>
               <p>And that this was all their Promise meant, is no new Opinion, but the sense of Archbishop <hi>Parker,</hi> who understood these things as well as any Man: He in <hi>Antiqu. Eccles.

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48421:63"/>
of the same Volume, <hi>They promised for the future not to</hi> Make <hi>nor</hi> Execute <hi>any Constitution without the King's License.</hi> None of these Writers, it is clear, thought the Clergy restrain'd by their Submission from any Debates, or Resolutions, which were previous to the Establishing a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non; for otherwise they would not, in their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of it, have omitted this Particular, which was above all others to be taken notice of: And none of 'em therefore, we may be sure, took the work <hi>Make</hi> in any other sense than to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act</hi>; or thought the word <hi>Attempt</hi> applicable to any but the Old Unauthoriz'd Canons.</p>
               <p>And the Judgment of these Persons is the more to be depended on, because the First of 'em liv'd at the time of the Submission<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and must be well acquainted with the sense then given of it; the Second was a Lay-man, and one who was thought to have but little regard for the Priesthood; and the Third, tho' of the Clergy, yet is observ'd throughout his Works, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Interest of the Order is concern'd, to be under no degree of Partiality towards them.</p>
               <p>More Authorities of this kind might be given, if either these were not sufficient, or the stress of the Point lay upon the way of wording the <hi>Submission</hi>; which it does not, but on the Terms us'd in that part of the <hi>Statute,</hi> where the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission is Enacted; and this we now come to consider.</p>
               <p>For after the <hi>Submission</hi> and <hi>Petition</hi> of the Clergy are thus recited in the Statute, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to Enact, that
<q>They, ne any of them from henceforth shall presume to attempt, alledge, claim, or put in Ure any Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:48421:63"/>
or Ordinances Provincial, or Synodals, or any other Canons: Nor shall Enact, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulge, or Execute any such Canons, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions, or Ordinances Provincial, by whatsoever name or names they may be call'd in their Convocations in Times coming, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they may have the King's most Royal Assent and License to Make, Promulge, and Execute the same.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now whatever Ambiguity there may seem to be in the words <hi>Attempt,</hi> and <hi>Make,</hi> as they lye in the Recital of the Submission, yet here in the Body of the Statute it self it is perfectly clear'd. For</p>
               <p n="1">1. The words [<hi>Attempt, Alledge, Claim, and put in Ure</hi>] are here manifestly divided from those [<hi>Enact, Promulge</hi> and <hi>Execute</hi>] and make a Distinct Member of the Period, having Substan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of their own, [<hi>Constitutions, Ordinances,</hi> &amp;c.] which they govern, and in which their signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is determin'd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. These words are plainly us'd to Enact the <hi>Petition</hi> of the Clergy, which prays a Suspensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Force of the Old Canons; and by these words, and these alone (as I have shewn) the force of those Canons is suspended: and therefore to <hi>attempt,</hi> as well as to <hi>alledge, claim, and put in ure</hi> must be understood of Canons, as <hi>already made;</hi> and not of Canons, as [<hi>in fieri,</hi> or] <hi>making.</hi> And if so, then</p>
               <p n="3">3. The Exception afterwards made, [<hi>Unless the said Clergy may have the King's most Royal As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and License to Make, Promulge, and Execute</hi>] can no ways refer to their Attempting, Alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Claiming, or putting in Ure: for a License to be had in order to <hi>make</hi> Canons, cannot possibly affect words that are us'd only of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons <hi>already made.</hi> And therefore,</p>
               <p n="4">
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:48421:64"/>4. That Exception belongs purely to the words immediately foregoing, by which they are forbid to <hi>Enact, Promulge,</hi> or <hi>Execute</hi>: Two of the words of this Prohibition [<hi>Promulge,</hi> and <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute</hi>] being repeated in the Exception annex'd; and the Third [<hi>Enact</hi>] being express'd by <hi>Make,</hi> a word of the same force and value.</p>

<pb n="93" facs="tcp:48421:64"/>
no other sense than I have given of it; distinctly severing it, in the Body of the Act, from all those words that have any respect to the <hi>Making</hi> of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and confining it to that Branch of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which suspends all the <hi>Old</hi> Canons <hi>alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy made.</hi> Then comes the other Branch, which prescribes the Method of <hi>making new ones;</hi> and forbids the Clergy to <hi>Enact, Promulge,</hi> or <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute</hi> any without the King's Assent: leaving them in the mean time to their Old Methods of Proposing and Deliberating; and reducing their Power only to the same Level with that of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments: over which they had before great and sensible advantages; in as much as they En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted Canons by their own Authority, without the Royal Concurrence, and in Synods often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, which met without a Royal Summons.</p>
               <p>This, I question not, is the true and genuine <hi>Exposition of the Act;</hi> and this being the very Hinge on which the Second Article of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute turns, I thought my self oblig'd to consider it with a very particular care, and to secure it, if possible, against all Exceptions. I hope, I have done so; and that the Reader is, by this
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:48421:65"/>
time fully satisfy'd, that no Restraint is laid by it upon any Convocational Act of the Clergy, previous to the <hi>passing a Canon;</hi> but that they have still as much Liberty to <hi>Treat, Debate,</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude</hi> (so they do not <hi>Enact, Promulge,</hi> and <hi>Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute</hi>) since this Statute, as ever they had before it. Sure I am, that it has been thus understood all along by those who may be presum'd to be best acquainted with its meaning; such as <hi>Poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> and <hi>Rastal</hi> were: The one, in his <hi>Abridge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> puts this Title before the Act, "<hi>That the Clergy in their Convocations shall</hi> Enact <hi>no Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions without the King's Assent:</hi> The other, in his <hi>Repertory,</hi> at the End of the Statutes, makes this to be the Purport of it, <hi>That the Clergy in their Convocations shall</hi> Enact <hi>nothing unless they have the King's Assent and License</hi>: Neither of 'em were aware, it seems, that their Liberty of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate</hi> was cut off by it.</p>

               <p>The Statute (as far as it relates to the Power of the Clergy in Convocation) plainly implies no more than that Canons should not from thenceforth pass, and become Obligatory, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the King's Leave and Authority given in that behalf; without his <hi>Le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

to their Passing, and his <hi>Authority,</hi> which was afterwards to ratifie, and give 'em force. And to understand the words of the Law other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise is, as has appear'd, to understand them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Propriety, and the Rules of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction; and which is still more unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to do this in <hi>Materiâ minùs favorabili,</hi> and where Ordinary Liberty is abridg'd; and last<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which is intolerable, where so grievous a Penalty as that of a <hi>Praemunire</hi> is to follow.</p>
               <p>The 25 of <hi>H.</hi> 8. then has not in the least al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd the Law of Convocations, in relation to any of the Powers or Priviledges of the <hi>Inferior Clergy:</hi> They can still freely Consult, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, Petition, or Represent, propose the Matter or Form of New Canons, and consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der about the Inforcing or Abrogating old ones; in a word, act in all Instances, and to all Degrees, as they could before the passing of that Statute. Indeed <hi>my Lord Archbishop</hi>'s hands are ty'd by it; for he cannot now call a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation without the King's Writ, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this Act he might, and in Elder Times frequently did: He cannot now Enact and Constitute any thing by his own Authority, as in Imitation of the Papal Power in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and of the Royal Power in Parliaments, it was usual for him to do: He must, before he passes any Act of the Two Houses, have the King's <hi>Assent</hi> to it; and after it is pass'd, there must be the King's <hi>License</hi> also to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulge and Execute it. In these several Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects the Metropolitan's Authority is consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably lessen'd by this Act; the Exercise of which is now chiefly seen <hi>in Moderating the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates of the Synod, and giving his Vote last upon
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:48421:68"/>
any Question propos'd there</hi>; as Dr. <hi>Cousins</hi> (Dean of the Arches to his Grace that then was) does in his Tables express it <note n="*" place="margin">Ejus est moderari Synodum, &amp; ultimò Suffragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ferre. <hi>Tab.</hi> 3.</note>. But the Powers and Priviledges of All the other Members of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation continue whole and entire to 'em, notwithstanding this Statute; and were so un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood to continue for a long time after it pass'd: the Methods of proceeding in Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation continuing the same for near Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>score and ten years after the Act, as they had been before it; the Clergy going on still to propose, deliberate, and resolve as they had been us'd to do, without Qualifying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for it by any Precedent License under the Broad Seal; the King, the Parliament, and People of the Realm allowing 'em so to do, without opposing this Method as Illegal, questioning it in the least, or calling 'em to an account for it. Indeed the Doubtful Wording of the Act might possibly give the Clergy some Alarm at first, and put them under Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions that their Liberty of Debate was abridg'd by it; or at least that it might be constru'd so to be by Those who in those Distressing Times were willing enough to take any Advantage of them. But their Scruples (if they had any) clear'd up in a little time, and their Fears va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish'd; and they afterwards fell to business with the same freedom, and under as little Restraint (for ought appears to the contrary) as any of their Predecessors had done before the Act of Submission. And thus the matter stood till the very End of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign: there being no Instance, I believe, to be given of a Formal <hi>Commission</hi> to Treat and Debate, Older than the Convocation of 1603,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:48421:68"/>
in the first of King <hi>Iames</hi>; which shall here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after be accounted for.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, we will suppose the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, that can by the severest Interpretation of the Act, be pretended; that the Clergy are by it cut off from forming the Draught of a Canon, or even deliberating about one, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being particularly impower'd to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose; yet are they still in several Inferior In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of Acting left perfectly free. It is not to be doubted but that, notwithstanding the Act, they may by an Humble Representation lay before my Lords the Bishops, the King, or his Great Council, any Growing Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and Disorders in the Church, any Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Errors that may happen to arise and spread in their time, any Outragious Excess of Vice and Impiety which they shall observe to prevail: and having made their Representati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they may venture to add their Requests for the Prevention or Suppression of such Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, Vices, and Errors; and even to point out the Methods of doing it. If they cannot move a step towards framing New Canons, yet at least they may interpose in behalf of the Old ones, and pray, that they may be vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously Executed, and duly observ'd. In a word, whatever Hardships or Grievances they may lye under from their Ecclesiastical or Civil Superiors (as 'tis possible for 'em to suffer from either) they have in Convocation a Right, and an Opportunity to declare 'em. These Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints it was heretofore their Custom to put up together with their Subsidies; and coming in such good Company therefore, they were for the most part favourably heard. Now they
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:48421:69"/>
have left off to Tax themselves, they must no longer draw Occasions of Relief, from the Wants of the Crown, but from the Goodness and Justice of Him that wears it. It will be for the Honour of a Reign, founded in the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the People, and secur'd by maintaining 'em, to suffer All Bodies of Men to enjoy their Rights, tho' they give nothing for it: Nor will it be any Reflection upon our most Excellent Prince, if the World shall see, that the Advice of so considerable a part of his Subjects as the Clergy are, may be welcome to him, even without their Subsidies.</p>
               <p>It is the Opinion of some Men, that that Mystery of Iniquity, <hi>Popery,</hi> is now at work, and carrying on among us in a very dangerous manner; and it is their Fear, lest that which could never succeed, when it appear'd bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac'd, should prevail by making secret and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceiv'd Advances upon us; whether their Fears are just, or no, I shall not determine: but would it not be fit that the Clergy should be left to their wonted Liberty of Assembling; that upon any such dangerous conjuncture, they might join their Councels, Endeavours, and Requests, to give a stop to the Growing Mischief? and by a Due Representation of the Danger groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on the sure Accounts that shall be brought to the Convocation by the several Members of it resorting thither from All parts of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, excite the Civil Magistrate into a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Care and Concern proportionable to the Danger?</p>
               <p>But should the Clergy have no Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, no Complaints to make to the King and Parliament, yet They themselves may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:48421:69"/>
of to either: and it is fit they should be ready to give answer to such Complaints. All other Bodies and Communities of Men, if any thing be mov'd in Parliament to their Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, can immediately Assemble and Confer together, and lay before their Superiors the Consequences of it, as far as their Particular Interests are concern'd: The Clergy alone have no such Liberty or Opportunity, if their Parliamentary Assemblies are not observ'd; and are in this respect therefore in a worse condition than the Pettiest Company or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration in the Kingdom.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, my Lords the Bishops are at hand always, to interpose in their behalf: but as they are no standing Committee of Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon whom the Care of the Clergy's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest in Parliament has at any time been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd; so neither is it proper, that it should be altogether lodg'd in their Hands; which are too full of other Business, to be able alone to discharge this to the best Advantage. As quick-sighted as their Lordships may be to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, and as Fatherly a Concern as they may have to remedy the Grievances of the Inferior Clergy; yet it is not to be expected, that they should either understand 'em so well, or repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent 'em so fully, or interpose so heartily for their Redress, as those who feel 'em. Mens In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terests have been ever best taken care of by such as were most immediately concern'd in 'em. Their Lordships, doubtless, want no Zeal for the Good of the Church, and of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the smallest Member of it. But in Men of their Age and Experience such Zeal is ever temper'd with great Caution, and manag'd
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:48421:70"/>
with nice Regards to the Probability of Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess, and to the Passions, and Prejudices, and Various Interests of Men. Now these Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straints might, it is hop'd, in some measure be taken off, and their Lordships encourag'd into a Reasonable Prospect of succeeding in any Proposal they had to offer on our Behalf, if they were back'd in it by the Joint Advice and Endeavours of the Clergy of the Province as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled. And as their Caution in Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing would in this case it is likely be less, so would their Interposition it self perhaps be of somewhat greater Weight and Influence; espe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Times, when their Lordships Actions may lye under any Prejudices, and their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters be misunderstood. At such Seasons, they will have enough to do, to support and promote their Own Interests; and will not be able (however willing they may be) to stand in the Breach, and be a Screen to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriors.</p>
               <p>Besides, their Lordships Good Offices are confin'd to the Upper House, nor can They take notice of any Parliamentary Matter, till it comes regularly before 'em there: whereas the Clergy, as well as all other Bodies of Men, ought to have the Priviledge of an Early Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress to the <hi>House</hi> of <hi>Commons,</hi> where so many Bills of Importance begin, that nothing may pass there to their Disadvantage, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing oppos'd, or understood; since That it self would be a Misfortune to 'em, tho' they were sure to have it quash'd elswhere.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Commons</hi> have a considerable Interest in the Lesser Clergy, by reason of their <hi>Patronage</hi>; They are their Protectors, and Guardians ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Law in relation to one part of their Maintenance; and will be extremely tender therefore of all their other Civil or Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Rights, and careful to cover them from any Attempts that shall be made upon their Priviledges: That so they may be in Heart, and at Hand always, to stand up with them in behalf of Liberty, when it shall be attack'd, and to resist a Growing Tyranny either in Church or State, as it may happen. For Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary Government is a Spreading and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Thing; and when once it is set up any where, there is no knowing where it will end.</p>
               <p>My Lords the Bishops therefore must excuse us, if, as great a Reverence as we bear to their Characters, and as high an Esteem as we have of their Personal Qualifications, their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, Capacity, Courage; yet we think it fit, that other Helps should be call'd in (since
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48421:71"/>
All Helps are but little enough) to support the sinking Interests of Religion, and the Clergy; and judge the Great Concerns of the Church no where so secure, as, where the Wisdom of our Constitution has lodg'd 'em, in the Hands of a Convocation of the Province. <hi>We know the Enemies of the Church sleep not, tho' the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men sleep too often</hi> — are the words of one, once an Active Presbyter of this Church, now a Vigilant Prelate <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Dr.</hi> Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net<hi>'s Fast-Sermon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the House of Commons.</hi> Anno 1681. <hi>p.</hi> 25.</note> We cannot, God be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, apply 'em to the Present Bench of Bishops; and would not, if we could, unless in a Case of the Utmost Necessity; because nothing less than that would justifie such a freedom in Meaner Authors. However Times may come, that will deserve such Language; but when, if the <hi>Provincial Assemblies</hi> of the Church be, together with its <hi>Watchmen, laid asleep,</hi> it will be too late to use it.</p>
               <p>The Right Reverend Author of that Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course (who should understand the Frame of our Church well, having written the History of it) observes, that <hi>it is happily Constituted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Extremes of Ecclesiastical Tyranny on the one Hand, and Enthusiastical Principles on the other Hand</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Ibid <hi>p.</hi> 9.</note>. It is so; and the Happiness of this Constitution, in relation to one of these Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes, lyes in the Interest which the Lower Clergy have in <hi>Convocation</hi>; where they are associated with their Lordships in the Care and Government of the Church: Whereas out of Convocation, they are not, I think, advis'd with; and have little else to do, but to observe Orders: The Diocesan Synods of our Church being not for Counsel <hi>now,</hi> but for the Exercise of the Episcopal Authority.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:48421:71"/>
This Happy Frame therefore should by all means be kept up; and the rather, because it suits very happily with that of the State, and with the Constitution of Parliaments. And it is highly expedient for every Church and State, that the Ecclesiastical Polity should be adapted to the Civil, as nearly as is consistent with the Original Plan of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; which, in our Case, there will be no danger of departing from, by a Compliance with the State-Modell: For I am sure, and am ready, when ever I am call'd upon, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to prove, that the more our Church shall resemble the State, in her Temper and Manner of Government, the nearer still will she approach to Primitive Practice; and the nearer she comes up to Both these, the more likely will she be to Endure and Flourish.</p>
               <p>What the same Eminent Pen has said on this Occasion, I willingly subscribe to;
That<q> as in Civil Government, a Prince govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Law, and having high Prerogatives, by which he may do all the Good he has a mind to, which yet he cannot abuse to act against the Law, and who is oblig'd often to consult with his People in what relates to common safety; by whose Assistance he must be enabled to put in Execution the Good Things he designs; is certainly the best Expedient for preventing the Two Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes in Civil Society, Confusion and Slavery: So a Bishop that shall have the Chief Inspection over those whom he is to Ordain, and over the Labours of those already plac'd; whom he shall direct and assist in every thing; and <hi>who governs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:48421:72"/>
by the Rules of the Primitive Church, and by the Advice of his Brethren,</hi> is the likeliest Instrument both for propagating, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving the Christian Religion <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Pref. to the Hist. of the</hi> Regal.</note>.</q>
I add, and for the keeping up of this Particular Church in some Degree of Repute and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; which have ever been best secur'd to it, when her Prime Pastors have met their Clergy often in Synod, and by their Advice and Assistance manag'd the Great Affairs of it.</p>
               <p>But if that be thought too much, and sound too high for the Lower Orders to pretend to; who must be contented rather to be the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of Ecclesiastical Government, than any Sharers in it; yet even Subjects themselves may <hi>Petition,</hi> and make known whatever Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, or Requests they have to offer, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Encroachment on any of their Superiors. And that the Liberty of such Addresses and Representations is still left to the Convocation, (to the Lower House alone, or to Both joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) I have fully shew'd: The Statute of Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, even under the most Rigorous Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of it, being scarce pretended to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge their Priviledges in this respect. And because Practice in this kind is the best Proof, I shall here add a few Instances of it.</p>

See 'em, <hi>Ibid. p.</hi> 344.</p>
               <p>The Clergy in Convocation were not us'd only to be Petitioners themselves, they were also some times address'd to in the same way by others; either by their Brethren of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablisht Clergy, or by those of the Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Of the former I have seen an Instance in Manuscript, being a <hi>Petition from the</hi> London-<hi>Ministers</hi>

               </p>

                     <hi>Hist. Ref. part</hi> 2. <hi>B.</hi> 2. <hi>Coll. n.</hi> 16.</note>. In the first we have an Instance of very Free Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocational <hi>Representations,</hi> and of yet freer <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions</hi> in the Latter; for it <hi>attempts</hi> not only Canons, but Acts of Parliament; and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly prays <note n="†" place="margin">

                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:48421:74" rendition="simple:additions"/>But the Clergy no more stand in need of these Instances, than they would joyn in these Designs and Petitions. The Statute of Submissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is none of their Grievances, nor do they ask, or wish a Repeal of it: They desire only that it may not have an Unnatural and Illegal Construction put upon it; and that they may be bound up no otherwise by it, than the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitters themselves were. They know indeed, that the Reflection which a Right Reverend Member of theirs once made upon this Statute was,
That <q>the Extreme of raising the Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical Power too high in the Times of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, had now produced another of depres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it too much: So seldom is the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoize so justly Ballanced, that Extremes are reduced to a well-tempered Mediocrity<note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Bishop</hi> Burnet<hi>'s Hist. Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>pp.</hi> 49, 50.</note>.</q>
But as they are not sure that this is his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's present Opinion, so they are certain it is none of Theirs: for they think their Power as Great as it need to be, if it be not made less than it really is. Had they lived indeed in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time, they should not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have humoured his Imperious Temper so far, as to have made that mean Submission, or tamely to have given up any one Legal Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which belonged to the Body, and was not inconsistent with the Good of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. But since it was made, and Enacted, they know how, like Good <hi>Englishmen,</hi> and Good Subjects, chearfully to obey it. Only they can never submit to such a sense of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission as was never intended, nor throughout that Age, wherein it was made, ever practised. This would be a much meaner part in them, than the first Act was in their Ancestors:
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:48421:74"/>
whose Religion was all Submission and Slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and it is no wonder therefore that the Fetters prepar'd for them sat so easily upon them. But in a Protestant Clergy, the profess'd Assertors of the Just Freedoms and Rights of Mankind in Religious affairs, and who have been more than once Instrumental in shaking off Yokes of every kind from the Necks of <hi>Englishmen,</hi> such Illegal Complyances would be inexcusable. In short, they have, and they own that they have, great reason to be content with the Priviledges which the Law has clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly marked out to them; and the Great <hi>Petition</hi> they have to offer is, that they may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enjoy them. If their Predecessors were struck with a Panick Fear, at the very sound of a <hi>Premunire,</hi> in a Reign when the Laity too trembled at the Noise of Thunder from Above; yet their Present Successors may not be e'er the less Dutiful, tho' they are not quite so much frighted: as having the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to live in a Time when the Priviledges and Rights of the <hi>English</hi> Subject are more clearly understood, and much better secured.</p>
               <p>Upon the whole then it appears,</p>
               <p>That the Clergy Commoners have all along had an undoubted Right of being frequently assembled, and particularly by the Law of <hi>England,</hi> as often as a New Parliament is call'd.</p>
               <p>That being assembled, they had antiently a Right of framing Canons, and doing several Synodical Acts (not inconsistent with the Law of their Country) without expecting the Prince's Leave for entring on such Debates, or making such Decrees.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:48421:75"/>That the 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 19. has not in the least infringed this Right, as far as the Lower Clergy are concerned in it.</p>
               <p>That the Limitations there made to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of it chiefly concern the Archbishop of either Province, who is now restrain'd, as from calling a Convocation without the King's Writ, so from Passing or Ratifying any Canon without the Royal License, and from Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulging the same by his Own Authority.</p>
               <p>That the Inferior Clergy are no otherwise concerned, than to take care that they give their Consent to no Canon fram'd by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, or sent from the Upper House, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than with Submission to the Royal Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure; if the King's License and Assent be not before obtained.</p>
               <p>That they are left therefore intirely at their Liberty to Confer and Deliberate even about New Canons; and also to Devise, Frame, and Offer them to the Upper House; if with a Protestation annexed, that they are neither intended nor desir'd to be enacted without the King's License.</p>
               <p>Much more, that there remains to 'em a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of Petitioning, either that Old Canons may be executed, or New Ones made accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Law, and to such Purposes as the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners shall suggest; or of representing their Humble Opinions concerning the Affairs of the Church, and of Religion; and, if need be, beseeching a Redress, at least in General Terms.</p>
               <p>This, I take it, is their Undoubted Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and would be used by them on Great Occasions, with the same Prudence and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:48421:75"/>
that their Predecessors are known to have practised; who, when they met without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, were so cautious of giving no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necessary Trouble either to Church or State, that they were more complained of, in some Reigns, for sitting still, than for stirring.</p>
               <p>By this time the Reader sees, that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son given for the Clergy's not Meeting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause, when met, and formed into a Body, <hi>they can do nothing,</hi> is a strange one. For, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing 'em to be tyed up never so strictly in their Decre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ing Capacity, yet surely it does not follow, that they can <hi>do nothing,</hi> because they cannot <hi>Make</hi> or <hi>Attempt</hi> a Canon. Is it <hi>nothing</hi> to speak the sense of the whole Clergy of the Kingdom in matters proper for them to intermeddle in? is it <hi>nothing</hi> to Petition, Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vise, Address, Represent; to give their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, where it may be desired, or their Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure where it may be needful? Is it <hi>nothing,</hi> with a Dutiful and Discreet Zeal to suggest the fittest Methods of securing the Christian Faith, of preventing the Revival of Old He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resies and Errors, and the Growth of New Ones? Is it <hi>nothing</hi> to do that, which ancient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, when Bills began by <hi>Petition,</hi> was the Great Priviledge of one Great Part of the Legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the House of Commons? I had thought that, while they had this at least (tho' they should have no more than this) to do, they had not <hi>nothing to do;</hi> but rather a very Great and Necessary Work. And whether such Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications are necessary, should, I suppose, be left to the Convocation it self, to determine; tho' others afterwards may either second, or reject these Applications; who may in these
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:48421:76"/>
Cases have the Power of Judging, but not of Prejudging the Actions of a Lawful Assembly: much less have they the Power of precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning the very Being of such an Assembly, because they foresee not what may be done in it.</p>
               <p>In truth, whatever may be pretended of the Convocations being able to do <hi>nothing,</hi> yet their not being allowed to Meet is a shrewd sign, that they can, when met, do <hi>something</hi>; and that they of the Clergy, who oppose their Meeting, are themselves of that Opinion: for were their Mouths really shut, and their Hands ty'd to that Degree they are represented to be, there could certainly be no Inconvenience in trusting such an Harmless Body of Men toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, nor would it be worth while to break through Antient and Received Practice in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to prevent their Assembling.</p>
               <p>The Innovation made in these matters has begun within these Ten Years last past. For tho' it has been usual to adjourn Convocations, a few days after they had met and sat, when there was little or no business to do; yet it was never till this time known that a Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation was adjourned before it sat; that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, before it was a Convocation. This New Practise (which Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> in my Opinion, by as New Law justifies) we know the Date of; and have reason therefore to obviate it, while it is New; and to take some care that it may not in a little time be able to plead a Quiet Prescription.</p>
               <p>The Clergy betray their Priviledges, if they lye still under the Publication of such Oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive Schemes, without as Open a Disavowal of
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:48421:76"/>
them, and without expressing their Detestati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Meanness of the Publisher. They deserve to be used as ill as their Open Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saries, or their False Friends would have them used, if they can suffer their most Valuable Right to be thus torn from 'em, in Print, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the least struggle for it. The Virgin in the Law of God was judg'd consenting to the Rape, who did not cry out, when Help was near, and was order'd therefore to be stoned together with her Ravisher. To prevent such an Imputation upon the Church, and the sad Consequences of it, her True Sons, were they as Rash as they are represented to be, would e'er this have shewed themselves against this New Advocate, in a more Open Manner, and in somewhat Greater Numbers than they have hitherto done; and might perhaps, for that End (could they no otherwise be heard) have interposed a Subscribed Protestation from their whole Body. But if this way of gathering scattered Hands would seem disorderly, and unsuitable to their Characters, and prove dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, it may be, to the Persons engaging in it; the more reason still have they to esteem and assert the Priviledge of being Legally as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, and put into such a condition, as to be able duly and safely to make their just Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and represent their Grievances.</p>

               <p>HAving largely shewed what the <hi>Two Great Convocation-Rights</hi> are, which I proposed to Treat of, and withal offered the several Chief Evidences and Proofs on which I build 'em; my Method laid down leads me in the next place to consider the <hi>Exceptions</hi> of all sorts which have been made to this Claim, by some Late Writers, pretending to answer the <hi>Letter to a Convocation Man;</hi> particularly by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of a <hi>Letter to a Member of Parliament,</hi> and by Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> in his Book intitled, <hi>The Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Christian Princes over their Ecclesiastical Synods asserted, &amp;c.</hi> This Book being written by a Person of some Station in the Church, and, as is pretended, under the Cover of a Great Authority, deserves to be examined with a more than ordinary care; which according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly I have resolved to bestow upon it. Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> indeed has a Peculiar Talent at enlarging on a Controversie; the shortest Point, when it comes under his Fruitful Pen, immediately improves into a Volume. I shall not so far follow his Example, as to trace all he has said<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> step by step, and Page by Page; and take eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Opportunity that he has given me of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open his misapplied Reading, and mistaken Reasonings: That would be an Endless Task, which I have no leisure for, neither does the Cause require it, nor would the Reader bear it. I shall endeavour therefore, as much as I am able, to shorten this Debate; and in order to it, shall first of all make some <hi>General Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions</hi> upon his way of managing it: wherein I shall shew, how very little there is in his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:48421:77"/>
Work, that really concerns the Point dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted; and how much of it is written against no body, and for no End in the World, that I can see, but the Pleasure of Emptying his Common-Place-Book. I may very aptly apply to him, what Bishop <hi>Andrews</hi> said of a much Greater Adversary: <hi>Etsi nobis lis nulla de Regiâ in Ecclesiasticis Potestate—tamen exorari non potest</hi> Tortus <hi>quin in Campum exeat istius Controversiae; &amp;, ubi quaestio nobis nulla de eâ re, ostendat tamen nobis Testes minimè necessarios. Explicare scilicet voluit Opes suas, &amp; ostendere quae habebat in Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versariis suis. Habebat autem ad hanc rem nonnulla, si incidisset alicubi: Iam quia non incidit, occasio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem arripit non valdè idoneam ea quoquo modo profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendi.

                  <note n="*" place="margin">Tortura Torti, <hi>p.</hi> 169,</note>. I shall not, I hope, be thought impertinent in displaying these Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinences of his; which I shall do in as narrow a compass, and under as few Heads of Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, as the variety of the matter will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of. And</p>
               <p n="1">I. I observe, that Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> has put himself to a great deal of needless pains to prove a Point, which he might, if he pleased, have taken for granted; that every Christian Prince, and Ours in particular, has an Ecclesiastical Supremacy; and that the Clergy are not, by a Divine Right intitled to transact Church-af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in Synods, as they please, and as often as they please, without any regard to the Civil Christian Power that they live under.
Many of those numerous Instances he has produced of Princes intermedling with Church-matters, here at home, or abroad, are designed only to assert this Great Truth: which however is a
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:48421:78"/>
Point that he needed not to have laboured so heartily, because no Church of <hi>England</hi> man ever denied it: not the Man he writes against, I am sure; who says only (and what he says I shall not fear to say after him) that <q>the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and Spiritual Powers are distinct in their End and Nature,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Lett. to a Conv. Man, pp.</hi> 17, 18.</note> and therefore ought to be so in their Exercise too. The One relates to the Peace, Order, Health, and Prospe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Man in this Life, as a Sociable Creature; the other concerns his Eternal State, and his Thoughts, Words, and Actions preparative thereto: The first is common to all Societies, whether Pagan, or Christian; the Latter can rightly be exercised among Christians only; and among them, not as inclosed within any Civil State or Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, but as Members of a Spiritual Society, of which <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> is the Head; who has also given out Laws, and appointed a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Succession of Officers under himself for the Government of this Society. And these Ministers of his did actually govern it by these Powers committed to them from him, for near 300 years before any Government was Christian. From whence, says he, it follows, that such <hi>Spiritual Iurisdiction can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be in its nature necessarily dependent on the Temporal:</hi> for then it could never have been lawfully exercised, till Kings, States, and Potentates became Christian.</q>
And agen in another place, —
<q>This Power having been claimed and exercised by the Apostles and their Successors, without any Regard, nay in Opposition to the Heathen Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Authority, is therefore, we say, <hi>not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarily
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:48421:78"/>
in its own nature dependent on such Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">P. 19, 20.</note>.</q>
Than which Reasoning nothing certainly can be more just; nor could that Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have expressed himself with more Caution and Guard upon so nice an Occasion. Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> seems here to have apprehended him, as if he had affirm'd, that Princes have nothing to do in Church-matters; the Management of which lyes without their Sphere, and no ways depends on Their Authority. But no Man living could have struck this sense out of his words, that was not either very Blind, or very willing, for some small End or other, to misunderstand him. Cannot this mighty Controvertist distinguish between <hi>Denying</hi> the Exercise of Ecclesiastical Power to be <hi>necessarily dependent</hi> on the Temporal, <hi>and affirming it to be necessarily independent</hi> upon it? Does he not see a difference between saying, that the Church <hi>may</hi> subsist without the State, and that the State has nothing to do in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Church? If he does not, he ought to forbear tampering in Disputes of this kind, till his Judgment is better, and his Head clearer. But if, seeing this difference, he yet resolved to take no notice of it; either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he had made Collections some time of his Life about the Supremacy, and was resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to take this Opportunity of giving himself the Credit of them; or because he saw it would be of use to him, to have the Writer he appears against represented under as Invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Colours, and his Opinions loaded with as much weight as was possible: if this were the Case, it must be allowed him, that there was some little Art, tho', I think, no very great share of Honesty in his Management.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="122" facs="tcp:48421:79"/>'Tis true, the <hi>Letter to a Convocation-man,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the last words I transcribed from it, adds,
<q>And if we should say further, that this Society has an Inherent and Unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable Right to the Exercise of this Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; it would be no more than what every Sect or Party among us claims, and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
But Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> could not with any colour lay hold of this Passage as asserting the Independency of the Church on the State: for, besides that it is only a way of arguing drawn from other Mens Principles; it is a few Lines afterwards expresly retracted, and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed:
<q>But this, says he, is what at the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent we neither do, nor need say.</q>
Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing which Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> is resolved that this he shall say, and maintain; and supposing it therefore to be his avow'd Opinion, draws down all his strength, and sets his Quotations in Array against it. From Fathers and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, from Antient and Modern Writers, our Own and Foreign Historians he learnedly proves, that the Church-power in a Christian Commonwealth is to be exercised in Subordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to the State; that Princes have of right all along called Councels and dissolved them, have hindred the Execution of some Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical Canons which were prejudicial to their Kingdom, and given the Civil Sanction to others—and a great deal more of this kind they have and may do; and must be allowed therefore a Supremacy in Ecclesiastical Affairs, and over Ecclesiastical Persons. And what if they be? Is there a Line in that Book he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, but what will stand good, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this were made out never so irrefraga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly?

A second Instance, wherein Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> has spent his Learned Pains to no purpose, is in the Tedious Account he has given us of the Power exercised by Princes, in relation to <hi>General Councils,</hi> and the Greater Church-Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies. These <hi>Researches</hi> (as he calls 'em) might well have been spar'd, upon a double account; both because the matter of 'em lyes not very deep, and can be no News to any Man that has but once touched on this Controversy <note n="‖" place="margin">Veteramenta omnia, detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta jam &amp; repetita millies, <hi>says Bishop</hi> Andrews, (Tort.

                  </note>; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause his Reading of this kind, tho' never so hard to come at, yet is nothing to the purpose. For the Dispute turns on <hi>Provincial Synods</hi> on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the Rights which the Church lays claim to in relation to Them: and it is no Proof, or Disproof of these Rights to
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:48421:80"/>
shew, what the Practice of Princes has been in convening and presiding over <hi>General Councils,</hi> which are Meetings of another Nature, and Original, and subject to quite different Laws and Usages.</p>
               <p>By <hi>Provincial Councils</hi> the Church was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd, and in such Councils all the Great Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of it were transacted for some hundreds of Years before the Empire became Christian; whereas <hi>General Councils</hi> owe their very Being to the Civil Power, without the Express Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Encouragement of which, after Christianity had once spread it self wide, they never did, or could assemble.</p>
               <p>The Times when Provincial Synods were to meet, the Persons that were to compose them, and preside in them, the Causes that were to come before them, and the manner of deciding those Causes, and of enforcing Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to their Decisions by Spiritual Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> these were all things fully agreed on and determin'd by the Rules of the Church, while it subsisted independently of the State: and when <hi>Constantine</hi> therefore by embracing the Faith became its Protector, he only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd those Antient Usages to the Church, which she was in possession of; He left the Practice of the Church just as he found it: only what was before an Ecclesiastical Rule, he made a Civil Right, and a Law of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</p>
               <p>Not so, as to <hi>General Councils</hi>; the Church had no Custom, no Prescription to plead, in relation to Them; they were Then first to be set up by the Civil Power, framed, and

moulded <note n="*" place="margin">L. M. P. <hi>Proves a</hi> Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident to a Nation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Church, <hi>by a passage in the Preface to</hi> Aelfricus<hi>'s Canons; where he finds it said, that the</hi> Christian Church for the first 300 years had no Convocation, <hi>p.</hi> 46. <hi>Can one imagin it possible for a Man to be in the Dark to that Degree, as not to know, that this was meant of</hi> General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils? <hi>But his Skill in Ecclesiastical History, it seems, goes no further than</hi> Lambert.</note>: and no wonder therefore if the Method of their Meeting and Acting was regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, in some of its chief Circumstances, by that Power which gave Birth and Establishment to them.</p>
               <p>The First of these Assemblies that ever sat, provided by a Canon for the continuance of Provincial Synods upon the Foot they had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways stood: and this Canon was reinforced by several succeeding General Councils, was ratified by the several Emperors, in whose Times these Councils were held, and inserted at last into the Code of the Imperial Laws: and from thenceforth the Synod of every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince was as Legal an Assembly as the Senate it self; had a right, at stated Times, to be Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned as duly, and to act within its proper Sphere as freely, as any Civil Convention whatever.</p>
               <p>But General Councils, even after they were set up, were not by any Law thus provided for; they were in their nature, and Instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Occasional Meetings,</hi> which had no fixed time allotted to them; but were to be called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Extraordinary Cases only, and when the Pressing Exigences of the Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired them: And no Bishop <hi>Then</hi> pretending to an Authority over All the Rest, even on that account it fell acourse to the Emperors share to Convene them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="126" facs="tcp:48421:81"/>The Assembling of so many Men of Rank and Character from so many Quarters of the Empire was a Power that could safely be lodg'd in no Hands but his that rul'd it: He was to be Judge, when such a vast Confluence was fit to be allow'd, and how far it consisted with the Peace of the State; at what Place and Time the Session should be opened, and how long it should continue. He by his Officers provided for the safe Conduct of the Fathers going to the Council, and returning from it; at his Expence they had Reception and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment on the way, and under the Security of his Protection they met and consulted. The Debates of such a Numerous Assembly must have been very disorderly and tumultuous, unless conducted by a Rule; which no single Bishop had a Right to prescribe to the rest, and which could not therefore come so properly from any one as from Him that Summon'd them. And that this Rule might be sure to be observ'd, it was requisite, that the Emperour should have a Place in their Assembly, should preside over, and moderate their Debates, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Person, or by his Deputies, as he saw occasion. After the Fathers had come to Reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and framed their Canons, it was of vast Importance to 'em to have the Secular Power ratifie what they had agreed on. They could Authoritatively declare, what was the General Sense of the Church on such and such Articles; but to procure that these Decisions should be generally received and obeyed in all Christian Countries, could no ways be so effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually brought about as by Civil Sanctions and Penalties.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="tcp:48421:81"/>On all these accounts, and many more, it was highly reasonable, and just, nay necessary almost, that the Imperial Power should exert it self in Appointing the Meetings, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning the Debates, and Confirming the Acts of General Councils. But was there the <hi>same</hi> Reason and Necessity for its interposing as par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in Provincial Synods also, which were Ordinary Meetings, of perpetual and standing Use in the Church, not Numerous, or Composed of Equals, but of Persons living at no Great Distance from one another, and all Subordinate to one Ecclesiastical Superior? Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> knows in his Conscience, that these Circumstances make a Wide Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them: and if so, why does he amuse us with Large Accounts of what Emperors have done, and been allowed to do, in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to those Great and Extraordinary Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, the Custom of which makes neither for nor against the Rule that was to be observed in these Ordinary Stated ones? To what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose was it for him nauseously to transcribe <hi>Labbée</hi> for fifty Pages together upon a <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place,</hi> which has been so often and so thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exhausted by the Writers of the Last Age; and which besides is of no manner of use to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards determining the present Dispute? Does he think to cover the want of proper and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite matter by such loose and General Refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions as these? Does he hope to make his Readers lose sight of the Point they are in quest of, in that Mist of Impertinent Quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with which he surrounds 'em?</p>
               <p>The Learned Mr. <hi>Hill</hi> had rightly observed, that what Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> produces <note n="*" place="margin">P. 10.</note> from <hi>Socrates</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Hist. Eccl. Praef. l. iv.</note>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:48421:82"/>
about the Emperor's interposing in the <hi>Greatest Councils,</hi> was of no weight in the present Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument; where we are enquiring, what the Usage and Rights of the Church are, not in the Greater, but <hi>Lesser Synods</hi>; which go by quite another Rule, and are much more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the Interposition of the Civil Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> makes a Scornful mention of this Distinction in the Preface to his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal <note n="*" place="margin">P. xxi.</note>, without vouchsafing to give any Reply to it: which was discreetly done, for it would not admit of any. The Distinction is just and well applyed; and had it been considered by Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> when he wrote, must have prevailed with him to withdraw above half the History that his first Chapter is filled with, and have made that part of his Work <hi>look</hi> no more Learned, than it really <hi>is.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Socrates</hi> might well say, that the <hi>Greatest</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods were held always at the Emperor's Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; but he knew <hi>the Lesser</hi> were not, and therefore omitted the mention of them.
And the same Caution is observed in one of our XXXIX. Articles <note n="†" place="margin">Art. 21.</note>; where it is affirmed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that <q>
                     <hi>General Councils</hi> may not be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd [upon any Occasion, in any Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances] without the Commandment and Will of Princes:</q>
But of <hi>Provincial Councils</hi> nothing is said. However the Churches Caution in Wording her Decision is not greater than Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s in citing it, who has, thoughout his first Book, made, as I remember, but one slight and General mention <note n="‖" place="margin">P. 10.</note> of this Article, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the words of it; which he knew would go near to suggest a Distinction, that it was not to his purpose to have observed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="129" facs="tcp:48421:82"/>Indeed the Canons of 1640 seem, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly seem, to go further; for in truth they do not.<note place="margin">Art. 1.</note> They affirm, that <hi>the Power of calling both National and Provincial Councils is the true Right of all Christian Kings within their own Realms and Territories</hi>; but say not, that this is the Right of <hi>Kings alone,</hi> so that no other Person or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons can in any Circumstances whatever claim or use it: on the contrary, they plainly teach, that where the Prince is not Christian, the Prelates of the Church may rightfully use this Power; so it be with Submission to the Civil Penalties and Punishments that may attend 'em on that account! and they intimate the Case to be the same under a Christian Persecuting Prince, tho' it was not so Decent openly to express it. The <hi>Canon</hi> and the <hi>Article</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are perfectly consistent, and both are drawn up with that Moderation, and Guard, as to give the Prince what is <hi>His Due,</hi> and yet not to deprive the Church of what may be <hi>Hers</hi>; but to leave the way open to the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of the same Power that she claimed and practised, before Princes came in to the Faith, if there should ever be the fame Occasion for it; which I hope there never will.</p>
               <p>And this Canon too was not, it seems, thought worthy to accompany Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s Other Collections; where Foreign and far fetched Authorities take up his Pen so much, that he had not room to consider what had been said here at Home upon the Subject; no, not in a Work written on purpose to clear and to assert the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> But we are not to wonder at it: for the same Happy Talent of Mind, which makes a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:48421:83"/>
Man abound in what is Trivial, makes him Defective also in what is Material.</p>
               <p>All that Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> can say for his way of arguing is, that he has in it traced the Steps of some of our Greatest Writers, who treating of the Supremacy, derive the Proofs of it from the same Sources he has done, and frequently give Instances of the Powers exercised by Princes over the Greatest and most General Assemblies; as appears from that Collection of Authorities which he has made in his <hi>Appeal.</hi> But this will not justifie him: for those Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, whose Pattern he pretends to follow, had to do with such Adversaries as quite shut out the Civil Power from interposing in Church-matters: Most of'em being engag'd either a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the professed Defenders of the Papacy, [as <hi>Iewel, Bilson, Nowell, Mason, &amp;c.</hi>] or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those of the Rigid Presbyterial way [as <hi>Whitgift, Hooker, Bancroft, Bramhall, &amp;c.</hi> were] In Opposition to these therefore it was proper to shew, how far the Practice of the first Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Emperors was consistent with such Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. And whether their Instances to this purpose were taken from the Greater or Lesser Church-meetings, from Provincial or General Councils, it was all one to the point in hand, and made equally against Those whose Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine they were to disprove. Not so in Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s Case, who, when he wrote his First Book, had no such Adversary to deal with; but One who argued altogether upon the Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a Civil Right, and drew his Plea pure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from our Domestick Constitution, and the approved Laws and Usages of the Realm. When Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> therefore by the <hi>Authorities</hi>
                  <pb n="131" facs="tcp:48421:83"/>
produced in his Last Piece would excuse the <hi>Doctrine</hi> laid down in his former, he deals un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairly with us: for those Authorities justifie only that part of his Doctrine which was fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to the Argument; they being Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions chiefly of the General Rights and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of Supreme Christian Powers in Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Affairs; without entring into the Various Restrictions of that Right, which the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Subjects may in several Places be intitled to by the Concessions of Princes and States, and by their particular Priviledges and Immunities; and without considering nicely, Where that Supremacy may in different respects be said to be lodg'd; and Who therefore must be taken in as Sharers in several Acts and Branches of it. Which Considerations nevertheless are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to determine the just Extents of our Princes Rights in this Case, and the Measure of our Obedience; as will hereafter, in Due Place, more clearly appear.</p>
               <p>In these Opinions our Old Writers had an Eye to the <hi>Act, and Oath of Supremacy</hi>; to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which was the business of that Age, in which they wrote: and their words therefore must be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, as that <hi>Oath</hi> is drawn up, <hi>Negatively,</hi> not <hi>Positively</hi>; that is, as denying the Usurpations in Ecclesiastical Matters, that have been made, or attempted, <hi>from without,</hi> upon the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> not as setling the exact Boundaries and Limits of that Supremacy <hi>within,</hi> in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion either to those who are to govern, or those who are to be governed by it: which is a Controversie, that there has hitherto been but little said of, and indeed but little Occasion to consider; and which could not therefore be
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:48421:84"/>
setled and determined by such Writers, as lived and died before it was started.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s <hi>Cloud of Witnesses</hi> therefore, which he produces in his <hi>Appeal,</hi> are very properly such; for they serve only to darken and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found the Point we are in pursuit of, not at all to clear it. They are such a <hi>Nubes Testium</hi> as we had in the Late Reign for <hi>Transubstantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> [and other <hi>Romish</hi> Articles] where the Old Fathers were vouched by whole-sale for a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that came not upon the Stage, till they were gone off it. And much the same Usage have the Fathers of our own Church had from the Pen of this <hi>Appellant</hi>; who has cited 'em, if pertinently, to Points that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps they never heard of, and to purposes that to be sure they never dreamt of; and to which had those Excellent Persons foreseen that their words would have been stretched, they would certainly have renounced such Consequences, or rather have prevented 'em, by expressing themselves more warily. They were to plead for the Supremacy of Princes against Those who were for allowing them no manner of Interest in Church-matters: and what wonder is it, if in the warmth of this Dispute they should, as the Fate is in All Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies, have sometimes a little over-thought or over-expressed themselves, and have laid down such Positions, as, tho' of sound Sense, when opposed to the Principles of those against whom they contended; yet when applyed in other Cases and Circumstances (then out of their Thoughts, and the Debate) might need some little softning? Their Great Concern was to secure the Royal Prerogative; and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:48421:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when that was done, they thought their own Rights and Priviledges would be secure under the Shadow of it. These they were then in a full Uninterrupted Possession of, without apprehensions that a Time might come, when they should be put to prove their Title to 'em; and when that Power, which they so warmly, and with reason, pleaded for, should be turn'd upon them, and made use of against the Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainers of it. Much less did they suspect, that ever any pretended Son of the Church of <hi>England</hi> would amass together all the Highest Assertions of the Regal Supremacy, scattered up and down in their Writings, in order to furnish out a Plea for suppressing the Liberties of that Church; and on purpose to prove, that Convocations were (what <hi>the Letter to a Member of Parliament</hi> sawcily says, <note n="*" place="margin">P. 26.</note> Bishops are) <hi>the Creatures of the Crown</hi>; which there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as it created, so it may annihilate at its pleasure. Such kind of Books indeed were written Twelve Years ago, by some False Members of our Communion, to make way for those Ill Designs that were then on foot, but to the Eternal Infamy of the Writers of them; who thought to find their particular account in the General Ruin of that Church and Constitution to which they belonged; but were, God be thanked, every way de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated in Their Expectations. There is not, 'tis true, so much Hazard now, as there was then, in exalting the Regal Power; when we live under a Prince, who is too Just and too Clear sighted, to be flattered into a Misuse of his Authority. However, no Thanks are due for this to the Flatterers, who have markt out
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48421:85"/>
the Arbitrary Scheme; and it is no fault of theirs, if it be not afterwards followed.</p>
               <p>My Indignation at such Unworthy and Mean Attempts has carried me away into Considerations, not so proper for this place, and led me a little from a strict pursuit of my Argument. I left it, where I was shewing, how weak Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s way of reasoning is, from the Powers exercised by Princes over the <hi>Greatest Synods,</hi> to their interposing equally in the Less. He himself seems to be sensible of it; and therefore, to prevent this Long Chapter of his being One Entire Impertinence, has sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up and down in it a few Instances of the Authority of Princes over their <hi>Provincial</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods: which being the only Instances there, that any ways affect our Argument, I shall not think much to consider 'em.

That in those Few Historical Facts, which seem apposite and proper, he either manifestly mistakes <hi>National,</hi> for <hi>Provincial</hi> Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods; or <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Assemblies, for <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary</hi> and stated ones; or conceals some Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances relating to the Story of those Meetings, which when known, give an Easie Account how the Royal Power came so parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly to interpose in 'em. Several of the Synods which he calls <hi>Provincial,</hi> were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly not so: Others, which were, yet were called by Princes upon Extraordinary E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergences, and do no ways prejudice the Right which the Church then had of assembling or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily at set times, without a Lay Summons.

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:48421:85"/>
                  <hi>Nicene</hi> Council to take place in their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and allowed the Synods of every Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to meet twice a Year in vertue of it, they did not by that preclude themselves from calling those Synods together at other times, when the Circumstances of the Church or State should require them. They parted with no Power that they had to Convene such As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, but only gave a Liberty to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the Province to meet at appointed Times, whether they had a Royal Command for it, or no.</p>
               <p>Besides, had Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> intended a fair state of this Point, he would have set aside all those Instances of Provincial Councils Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned by Princes, where those Princes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted their Power, only to make Metropolitans, who were remiss, do their Duty, and obey the Canons: or, where they interposed only to revive the Use of such Meetings, which had been under a long Discontinuance in their Kingdoms; and when they had done so, lest them afterwards to their Ordinary Course. In these Cases, whatever the Prince did, he did in <hi>behalf</hi> of the Churches Rights, and his Act ought not therefore to be alledged, and cannot fairly be construed to their prejudice. Nay, in the most Ordinary and Regular Assemblies of the Province, should any mention be made in their Acts of their Meeting by the Civil Authority; yet it ought to be considered, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the same Time, and in the same Acts their Right of meeting by the Canons also be not claimed. For if it be, the Exercise of the Regal Power in such Instances is no Bar to those Liberties of the Church, which are at
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:48421:86"/>
the same time expresly asserted and maintained. Kings may order their Bishops to meet, when those Bishops would have met, tho' unordered: and all therefore that such Bishops, when met, could do, to secure their Ecclesiastical Right of Meeting, was to mention it together with the Royal Precept: and this we may presume 'em purposely to have done, to prevent those Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedents being drawn into Consequence, and under a Prudent Foresight of the Ill Uses that might be made of them by such Betrayers of the Church-Rights as our Author, in Future Ages. These Circumstances should have been considered by him; and, where they take place in any of the Instances of Provincial Councils he alledges, acknowledged. But it was not agreeable either to his Design, or his Temper, to enquire into matters thus carefully, or to state 'em thus candidly and fairly. It was enough, if upon a Superficial View of the Acts of Provincial Synods, or those that passed for such, he found at the Entrance of any of 'em a mention of the Royal Power: This he knew would have the Look of a Proof; and, whether it had more than that, he knew not, and cared not, and hoped other People would not give themselves the Trouble to enquire. To come to Particulars.</p>
               <p>The First Instance he has produced of the Authority of Princes over Provincial Synods, is this: <hi>When</hi> Theodoret (says he) <hi>began to be busie in calling the Bishops together,</hi> Theodosius <hi>not only laid a Prohibition upon him; but confined him to</hi> Cyrus, <hi>his own little See, as a Punishment for what he had done before.</hi> P. 18. I question whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> ever gave himself the Trouble
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:48421:86"/>
of reading those three Epistles <note n="*" place="margin">Epist. 79, 80, 81.</note>, which he cites on this occasion, tho' not with right Numbers. For there he would have found, that <hi>Theodoret,</hi> when thus prohibited by the Emperor, was at <hi>Antioch,</hi> where he had no more Authority <hi>to call the Bishops together,</hi> than at <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Constantinople.</hi> He had been called up thither from his Little See, to reside with <hi>Iohn</hi> the Patriarch; and whatever of this kind he did therefore, he did by his Order, and as his Substitute. But <hi>Theodosius</hi> finding the Peace of the <hi>East</hi> hazarded by these Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, and the <hi>Nestorian</hi> Heresie favoured by them, sent an Order to <hi>Theodoret,</hi> upon whose Advice the Patriarch acted, to retire to his own Diocese, and live there. This is the true account of that matter, which how it makes for or against any Point in Dispute be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> and his Adversaries, is to me hard to apprehend.</p>
               <p>The next Provincial Synod he mentions is that of <hi>Agatha,</hi> called by <hi>Caesarius</hi> Bishop of <hi>Arles; but not</hi> (says the Dr.) <hi>till he had obtain'd the Consent of</hi> Alaric <hi>the</hi> Goth <hi>for it; and it is expresly noted that it was held by his Allowance</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 20.</note>. What if it were? was it not a mighty favour that thirty five Catholick Bishops (for so many were present <note n="‖" place="margin">Vide Conc. Meld. c 73</note>) should be allowed to meet under an <hi>Arian</hi> Prince; tho' the Rules of the Church were on their side? and was not this favour fit to be acknowledged in their Acts? especially, since at the same time they took care to assert their Ecclesiastical Right to such Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to ordain <note n="*" place="margin">Can. 71.</note> that for the future, in obedience to the Canons, Provincial Synods should be held yearly. The <hi>Permission of the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:48421:87"/>
Prince</hi> would be sufficiently accounted for this way, had this Synod been both <hi>Ordinary,</hi> and <hi>Provincial</hi>; but it was really neither: not Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, for it was called after a long Intermis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of Councils in those parts, to restore the Decayed Discipline of the Church; not <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial,</hi> for <hi>De Marca</hi> has observed <note n="*" place="margin">L.VI. c. 17. §. 1.</note> that no less than five Metropolitans, and the Proxy of a sixth, subscribe to it. But the Doctor found it styled Provincial in the Tomes of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and he look'd no further.</p>
               <p>Such another Provincial Council is the very next he insists on <note n="†" place="margin">Ibid. p. 20.</note>, that of <hi>Epaon</hi>: it was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of the Bishops of Two Distinct Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, those of <hi>Vienne,</hi> under their Archbishop, <hi>Avitus,</hi> and of <hi>Lyons,</hi> under <hi>Viventiolus</hi>; as the Subscriptions, if he had not been too much in hast, would have informed him.</p>
               <p>Among the <hi>Spanish</hi> Councils, he meets with Two that were Provincial, the Synods of <hi>Narbonne,</hi> and <hi>Saragosa:</hi> and <hi>of both these,</hi> he tells us, <hi>it is said, that they met according to the Order of</hi> Recaredus.<note place="margin">Pag. 23.</note> But by his favour, this is said of neither. In that of <hi>Narbonne,</hi> they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm <note n="‖" place="margin">Concilia Sanctorum Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trum vel Decreta observare cum timore Dei cupientes, Nos in Urbe <hi>Narbonî,</hi> secundum quod Sancta Synodus per ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nationem Gloriosissimi nostri <hi>Recaredi</hi> Regis in urbe Toleta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nâ finivit—in unum conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimus.</note> themselves to meet in vertue of the Antient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons, and of the Decree of the third Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> which met by <hi>Recaredus</hi>'s or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. In that of <hi>Saragosa,</hi> they own themselves indeed to meet by the <hi>Permission,</hi> but not by the <hi>Order</hi> of <hi>Recaredus:</hi> and this Permission might be, and probably was no more than what was contained in the Canon of that Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> which had
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:48421:87"/>
revived the use of Provincial Synods in <hi>Spain,</hi> but just before; and the Acts of which <hi>Recare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus</hi> had confirmed.</p>
               <p>In <hi>Gallicia</hi> he finds the Second Synod of <hi>Braga</hi> (which was Provincial) to have assembled at the Command of <hi>Arianirus</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 23.</note>. It did so: but it must be considered, that no Synod had been held in those parts for many years before <note n="†" place="margin">Diu est <hi>(says the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan in his Speech by which he opened it)</hi> Sanctissimi Fratres quòd secundum Instituta Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabilium Canonum &amp; Decreta Catholicae &amp; Apostolicae Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplinae, desiderabamus Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotalem inter nos fieri debere Conventum: quia non solùm Ecclesiasticis Regulis &amp; Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nibus opportunum est, sed sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilem etiam semper efficit Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatis Fraternae Concordiam, dum congregati simul in no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine domini Sacerdotes ea in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter se salutiferâ collatione re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirunt, quae secundum dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionem Apostolicam Unitatem Spiritûs in Vinculo Pacis ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineant.</note>. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored the Catholick Faith, and the Use of Councils; both which were lost in that Country by a Long Successi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Arian</hi> Princes (as both of 'em are usually lost toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.) And to this End he ordered his Bishops to meet, which could be no otherwise than Provincially; for his whole Kingdom was then under one Metropolitan. Is it any wonder, that after so long an Intermission, the first Provincial Synod that met, should gratefully own that Princes favour, by whom they were allowed and encouraged to assemble? which yet they do, in such a manner, as to declare also, that by the Canons of the Church, they had a Right to meet, and that their being debarred of that Right was a Violence upon 'em.</p>
               <p>The Council of <hi>Lugo</hi> afterwards (which sat in 569, or thereabouts; not, as Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> says <note n="*" place="margin">P. 23.</note>, in 607; mistaking grosly the <hi>Spanish Aera,</hi> for the Year of our Lord) professes it self to have met at the Command of <hi>Theodimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>;
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:48421:88"/>
but it was upon an Extraordinary Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, the Erecting the See of <hi>Lugo</hi> into an Archbishoprick; in which the Civil Power was nearly interested, and to which it was requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>site therefore that it should concur. But after that was over, the Two Metropolitans of <hi>Braga,</hi> and <hi>Lugo,</hi> Convened their Provincial Synods apart, according to the Canons, and without the King's Order, as far as appears; and needed his Command only to unite these Two Synods into One National Assembly.</p>
               <p>As to the Seven <hi>Burgundian Synods, whose Acts,</hi> he says, <hi>avow the Authority by which they met</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 24.</note>; tho' he would insinuate, yet he does not directly affirm any of them to have been <hi>Provincial</hi>; and I shall not therefore stay to prove that they were not so. That Five of them were not, is certain; and that the Two Others were, if not more than Provincial, yet at least Extraordinary, it will be time enough to prove, when he has told us, which he gives up, and which he insists on.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Pag.</hi> 35. he professes to speak only of the Power of Princes over their <hi>Lesser Synods</hi>; let us see by what Instances he chooses to make it good.
He tells us, that <q>when <hi>Wolfolendus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Bourges</hi> Summoned a Provincial Council according to the Canons, yet ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving neglected to consult the King's Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure in it, we find <hi>Sigebert,</hi> for that reason alone, forbad his Bishops to go to it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Story indeed would be something to his purpose, were it rightly represented; but nothing can be more insincere than his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of telling it. For the proof of this I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the account which <hi>De Marca</hi> has given
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:48421:88"/>
us of this matter, <hi>L.</hi> VI. <hi>c.</hi> 19. <hi>Sect.</hi> 5. there he informs us, that <hi>Bourges</hi> of which <hi>Wolfolendus</hi> was Archbishop, was in <hi>Clovis</hi>'s Realm, <hi>Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stria</hi>; not in <hi>Sigebert</hi>'s, <hi>Austrasia</hi>; which was all out of the Province of <hi>Bourges</hi>: That He nevertheless, at the Desire of the <hi>Austrasian</hi> Bishops, designed to come with his Suffragans out of his own Province, into some City of <hi>Austrasia,</hi> to have a Meeting there with the Bishops of that Kingdom; and pretended to do this, by vertue of some Antient Canons, without so much as consulting <hi>Sigebert</hi> in it; who for this reason resolved, as he justly might, to oppose him. We see here, that this Synod was not Provincial, but the Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Archbishop and his Suffragans of one Kingdom with the Bishops of another; and this appointed to be in the Territories of a Prince, where that Archbishop had no Jurisdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and without so much as acquainting him with it. What wonder if <hi>Sigebert</hi> made use of his Royal Power to hinder such a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? or what Instance could Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> have pitched upon, less to his purpose; without it be that which follows?</p>
               <p>When the Fifth Council of <hi>Paris,</hi> he says, <q>had resolved it to be Expedient,<note place="margin">P. 36.</note> that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Synods should be held every year, according to the Orders of the Church, and the Canonical Custom establisht in it: They made it their Request to <hi>Lovis</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and <hi>Lotharius</hi> his Son, that they would consent that at a fit season every year they might be assembled. This Request was agen renewed some years after in another Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod.</q>
Thus far he is of our side; for what
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:48421:89"/>
can be more to the advantage of Provincial Synods than this Decree of the Council of <hi>Paris,</hi> and their Request in consequence of that Decree, to the Civil Powers, that they would suffer it to take effect according to the Canons? It follows,
<q>Yes, notwithstanding these <hi>General Permissions,</hi> before they did come together, they were to have a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Warrant for their so doing; as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent (says he) from the Acts of the Synod of <hi>Soissons.</hi>
                  </q>
Which Synod of <hi>Soissons,</hi> one would think now, was certainly <hi>Provincial</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and yet it was composed of the Bishops of no less than Five Provinces, as <hi>De Marca</hi> assures us <note n="*" place="margin">L.VI. c. 26. §. 2.</note>; and the Names of several Metropolitans are now fairly legible in the <hi>Front</hi> of it; which is that part of the Acts, with which Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> is usually best acquainted.</p>
               <p>I thank him here for mentioning this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the Council of <hi>Paris</hi>; for it gives me an occasion of supplying his account, and of adding the Reasons, by which the Authors of that Decree governed themselves in the passing it, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <q>Because, if Provincial Councils were held Annually, the Honour of the Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Order would be supported, Ill Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men would be discouraged, many Offences which escape now with Impurity, would be taken notice of, and many Instances of Church-Discipline, now superseded, would, by the blessing of God be restored <note n="†" place="margin">Quoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am si haec semel in Anno per unamquamq<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Which
<pb facs="tcp:48421:89"/>
Reasons, whether they will not serve as well to prove the Expedience of Convening fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the Synods of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York,</hi> I leave the Reader, who understands the state of this Church and Nation, to determine.</p>
               <p>These, I think, are all the Instances of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Councils, which he expresly produces as such, throughout his first Chapter: and I appeal now to the most Partial of his Friends, whether any one of 'em does in the least coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance that Extravagant Principle which he sets up for, That the Calling, or not calling of Convocations (<hi>i. e.</hi> Provincial Synods) the allowing, or not allowing them to meet and sit, was a Thing always at the Free and Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Pleasure of the Prince; even where the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canon was admitted, as a perpetual Law of the Church. I do not wrong him, in representing this as the Design of that large Historical Account of the Authority of Princes over their Councils, which he has given us: for besides that he must either have had this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, or none (nothing less than this being of any service to that side of the Debate which he espouses); Besides this, I say, the very Terms in which he expresses himself shew this to be the true and only End he aims at:
<q>Tho',<note place="margin">Pag. 34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </note> says he, the Council of <hi>Nice</hi> first, and, after that, several other Councils provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for the constant meeting of Provincial Synods every year; and these being allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by the Emperors and other Princes who confirmed those Canons, and approved of what they had defined, may seem to have put these kind of Synods at least out of their power; yet even in These we find 'em still
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:48421:90"/>
continuing to exercise their Authority; and not suffering even such Councils to be held, without their Leave, or against their Consent.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To confirm which, he produces two o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> three Stories, which I have shewn to be ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly wide of the mark; and then concludes:
<q>So intirely has the assembling of [these Provincial] Synods been looked upon to depend on the Will and Authority of the Christian Prince <note n="*" place="margin">P. 36.</note>!</q>
A Conclusion that has no Premisses, nor any one clear and full In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance in all his Long Beadroll of Councils to support it.</p>
               <p>The Doctor had kindly prepared us in his Preface, to expect <hi>Digressions</hi>; but withal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mised us, in his nice manner, that they should be <hi>rather not directly to the purpose than altogether distant from it.</hi> However I find not that he has kept his word with us, or that they deserve to be thus gently dealt with. In the first of 'em, that meets me here, I have shewn nine parts in ten of it [<hi>i. e.</hi> whatever he has said a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>General Councils</hi>] to be altogether distant from the purpose; and that the other poor Scantling [about <hi>Provincial</hi> Synods] which seems to be, yet is really not, to the purpose: and I conclude therefore that the whole is <hi>not only not directly to the purpose, but altogether distant from it.</hi> The Doctor must forgive me if I tell him, that these Historical Unedifying Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of his put me in mind of the Honest Confession of <hi>William Caxton</hi> the Chronicler; the words of which will become Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s mouth as well every whit as they did His; and I cannot help thinking that I hear him in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:48421:90"/>
the close of his first Chapter thus addressing himself to his Reader:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yf I cowde,</hi> says he, <hi>have founde mee storyes I wolde have sette in it moo; but the substaunce that I can fynde and knowe I have shortly sette theim in this boke; prayeinge all theym that see this symple werke of myne to pardon me of my symple writynge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And indeed I for my part should have been very ready so to do, had it been as <hi>Harmless</hi> as it is <hi>Simple</hi>; and were it not likely, as <hi>Simple</hi> as it is, to be produced hereafter for a Testimony against the Churches Rights, if it be not now opposed and disowned. For which reason, how <hi>Simple</hi> soever the performance is, it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be examined; and I go on therefore to observe,</p>
               <p n="4">IV. That Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> distinguishes not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Powers <hi>in Fact</hi> exercised by Princes, and those <hi>of Right</hi> belonging to them, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their Office. Good Princes have been allowed often to extend their Authority in Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituals very far, and Ill Princes have often usurped an Authority beyond what they were intitled to. Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> troubles not himself with these Considerations; but what ever Powers he can find any Prince, (whether Good or Bad) to have exercised over the Church, Those he proposes, as Patterns, which all other Princes may safely copy, and as the true Bounds and Measures of the Royal Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, When in the Story of our Convocations
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:48421:91"/>
some Acts of theirs come cross him, that he does not like, then his Maxim is, <hi>That they did take upon them to do this is no proof that they had a Right to do it</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 296.</note>. But the most Extravagant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of Princes in the Ordering Church-matters are admitted by him without any such Guard or Distinction; without considering Who it was that did this or that, and in what Circumstances, and for what Reasons they were submitted to in the doing it. <hi>Charlemagne</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and <hi>Recaredus</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> ordered Ecclesiastical Affairs with a very high hand, and had certainly somewhat more than their Share came to in the management of them. But this was tacitly yielded to by their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, who saw, that to whatever Degree their Power was carried, it would all be employed for the Establishment of the Church, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the Christian Religion. What They did therefore must not, because they did it, be presently presumed to be the Common Right of every Christian Ruler; but often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times an Instance only of a Discreet Comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, in the Clergy, with such Intrenchments on the Liberties of the Church, as might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to the benefit of it. Good Princes, who had the Hearts of their People, and were known to be intirely in their Interests, have been permitted to carry their Prerogative in Civil Matters to an heigth, that has been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood and retrenched in more suspected Reigns.

                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:48421:91"/>Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> finds perhaps in the Acts of some Councils Expressions of Great Duty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect used to Pious Princes by their Clergy; These presently he lays hold of as Authentick Synodical Decisions. The Council of <hi>Tours,</hi> it seems, did once upon a Time, tell <hi>Charles</hi> the Emperor <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> p. 92.</note>, that they left their Decrees to Him to do what he pleased with them; and the Council of <hi>Arles</hi> begged him, if he thought fit, to amend and alter them <note n="†" place="margin">Ibid.</note>: This is Handle enough for Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> to annex such an <hi>Altering Power</hi> to the Kingly Character, and to represent the Business of Synods to be only the <hi>preparing of matter for the Royal Stamp,</hi> which may be <hi>improved, corrected, enlarged, shorten'd</hi> at the Prince's Pleasure; as (in <hi>p.</hi> 84, and 85. of his Honest Performance) he is pleased to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press himself; and therein to intitle the King, <hi>de Iure,</hi> to a more Extravagant Authority, than ever the Pope himself, I believe, with all his Plenitude of Power, <hi>de facto</hi> exercised, or claimed. But surely this is a Doctrine of too great Importance to be established on so slight a bottom: and of such dangerous consequence to the Church, that nothing less than the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal Practice of the Church can sufficiently authorize it. The Doctor may remember, when he wrote against <hi>Prayers for the Dead,</hi> in a late Reign, his way of arguing was, that Doctrines of that weight were not to be built on the Figurative <hi>Apostrophe's</hi> and Rhetorical Flights of the Fathers: but now he is of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mind; every Submissive word, every Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spectful Form of Expression that he finds to have dropped at any time from the Mouths of the Members of a Synod, when addressing to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:48421:92"/>
their Prince, is Ground sufficient to rear a proof of his Prerogative upon. But thus it is, when Princes are to be complimented at the Expence of their Subjects Rights, Compliments shall pass for Arguments!</p>

                  </note>) Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, says, that <q>the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Divines who consulted upon these Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles were divided in their Opinions, some following <hi>Luther,</hi> and some the Old Doctrine; whose Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on either side the King himself took pains to peruse and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, adding Animadversions with his own Hand, which are to be seen in our Records <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Hist. H.</hi>S. <hi>p.</hi> 469.</note>.</q>
But these words I must be bold to say, are mistaken both by my Lord Bishop, and Mr. <hi>Nicholson,</hi> if they infer from thence, that the King made any Alterations in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles after they were drawn up; since the <hi>Anim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adversions</hi> plainly were, not on the <hi>Articles themselves,</hi> but on the <hi>Arguments</hi> urged on ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther side of the Questions determined in 'em.
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:48421:93"/>
These Arguments, or Opinions, were, it seems according to the known way of that time, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in Writing, and subscribed by the Parties maintaining 'em: And the King took upon him to temper and soften the Expressions on either side, till he had brought both to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance. But this is a very different thing from his <hi>Correcting</hi> and <hi>Amending</hi> the Articles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves; even as different, as assisting in the Debates of a Synod, before the Conclusion is formed; and altering the Conclusion it self, after it has been unanimously agreed on.</p>
               <p>This is truly the Case of those <hi>Amendments</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, which Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> is so full of: However had it been such as he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents it; yet no Argument of <hi>Right,</hi> I say, can be advanced on such <hi>Facts</hi> as these; and it had become Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> therefore, when he related 'em, to have told us withal, that they were unjustifiable. Many of the Actions of that <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Head of the Church</hi> were such, as cannot justly, (and will therefore, I hope, never) be imitated by any of his Successors. For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, he made his Bishops take out Patents to hold their Bishopricks <hi>at pleasure</hi>; tho' I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose my Lords the Bishops that now are, do not think such a Power included in the Notion of the King's Supremacy.</p>

               <p>Intimations of this kind have been thought so Heinous as to be purged only by <hi>Fire</hi>; a Punishment which our Gentle Laws, tho' they have taken it off from Men, have still re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for Books, and applyed it now and then to repress a State-Heresie, and secure the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals of our Constitution, against All its Underminers.</p>
               <p>This Conqueror, and his Family are much in request with our Writer; and agen there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of his Son <hi>William Rufus,</hi> he tells us (not without a Glance on more Modern Times) that <hi>he would suffer no Ecclesiastical Synod to be held during</hi> the thirteen years of <hi>his Reign</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 185.</note>: But let me ask our Man of History, which of all those Historians in whose Works he has so hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily spent his <hi>Researches,</hi> represent this part of <hi>Rufus</hi>'s Character to his advantage? which of 'em that mention the thing, do not also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of it, as one of the Greatest Hardships of that Cruel and Oppressive Reign? and to be ranked with that other Righteous Practice of his, by which he kept Vacant, and set to Farm all the Bishopricks and Abbies, as they fell, and had by that means, when he died, no less than Twelve of them in his Hands <note n="*" place="margin">

but under <hi>William</hi> the Third: A short Answer to an Hundred such Old Tales as these; but every good <hi>Englishman</hi> will think it a full one. Less have we to do with his Outlandish Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Ecclesiastical Tyranny; such as the Dealing of <hi>Constantius</hi> was with the Council of <hi>Ariminum:</hi> A very Righteous and Laudable Act which Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> proposes for the Instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of future Princes; and was, as follows: When the four Hundred Fathers assembled there, had finished the business for which they met, and determined the disputed Points clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly against <hi>Arius,</hi> they begged of <hi>Constantius,</hi> that they might return home, and attend their Flocks: but he refused 'em, ordering his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to keep the Synod together by force, till they had revoked their former Decision, and subscribed an <hi>Arian</hi> Form that he transmitted to them; upon which, those who were resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved not to comply, made their Escape as well as they could, and even without his Permissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on went back to their Dioceses. But <hi>Constanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> not having given them his Leave, neither will Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> give them His; and does as good as say, they did Ill to separate without the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror's Order, and deserved his <hi>Resentments</hi> for so doing <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:48421:95"/>
it? For it is certain that Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces these <hi>Facts,</hi> purely to establish <hi>Rights</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; and having laid down his Historical Grounds therefore does, in every Instance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to draw his Conclusions from them: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in This we are upon [the Instance of a Tyrannical Power exercised by <hi>Constantius</hi> over the Fathers at <hi>Rimini</hi>]; after he has told the Story, and added Two other accounts of the Imperial Authorities exerting it self on the like Occasions, he thus concludes: <hi>It is</hi> therefore <hi>the Duty of All Synods, as they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven'd by the Prince's Authority, so to tarry, till they have the same Authority for their Dissolution</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 79.</note>.</p>
               <p>Let him not hope then, after amassing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all the Instances of an Ungodly Usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation in Princes upon the Liberties of the Church, to come off by saying, that we are to distinguish between what he relates as mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>History,</hi> and what as matter of <hi>Opinion</hi>; and by leaving it in his own Power afterwards to apply this General Plea to any particular Instances in his Book, as he shall have need of it; for these Two in Works of this Nature cannot be separated. Where an enquiry is made, what Princes <hi>may lawfully do,</hi> and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it an History drawn up of what they have <hi>actually done</hi>; there all the Accounts the Historian gives us of their Acts he must be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to approve too, unless he has taken care to warn us to the contrary, and to express his Abhorrence of them. Should a Man pretend to mark out the Bounds of the King's Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative in Civil Affairs, and to that End deduce an account of all the most Arbitrary and Ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Acts of our Princes, by which they have
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48421:95"/>
trampled on the Liberties of their Subjects, and the Power of Parliaments; would it avail him afterwards, in abatement, to say, that he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended these Instances by way of <hi>History</hi> only, and not to express his <hi>own sense</hi> of things; when his own sense of things is manifestly built on those Historical Accounts, his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions deduced from them, and supported by 'em? Such a poor Excuse would not be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in behalf of such a <hi>Chronique Scandaleuse</hi>; Every Good <hi>Englishman</hi> would still see through, and detest the Design; and the Author, under all his shifts, would be as scandalous as his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story. But to proceed in our Remarks. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve,</p>
               <p n="5">V. That Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> in his accounts of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Councils often confounds two things that are widely different, the Prince's power of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing</hi> any Subject of Debate to his Synods, and his Power of <hi>confining</hi> 'em to debate of nothing but just what he proposes. As to the First of these, no body questions the Prince's Right in all Synods, from the Greatest to the Smallest: but as to the Latter, he has neither Right or Practice on his side; not even in the most Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Councils (where the Civil Authority al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways exerted it self most), whatever Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> may pretend to the contrary. 'Tis true, in those Larger Synods, which met at the Call of Princes, upon Extraordinary Occasions, the way generally was, that the Business for which they were called should be first handled: and from the Acts of those Councils it appears, that the Emperor, or his Commissioners, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed sometimes to prevent their entring on
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:48421:96"/>
any foreign matter, till That was dispatched; call'd 'em back to it, when they wandered; and made 'em begin their Debates anew, when they had proceeded irregularly. But after This was over, that they never entred on any new Point without his express Direction, and in every step of their other Debates expected his Order, is an Assertion worthy of Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> p. 48.</note>, and every way becoming his Cause and his Character. Let us see how he proves it: He instances first in the Great Council of <hi>Ni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e,</hi> whose <hi>Acts</hi> were either never drawn up in form, or quickly lost; and one would think it therefore pretty difficult to give a Punctual ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>count of their manner of Proceeding: But Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> by the help of some History, and more Divination, ventures upon it:
<q>It was called, he says, to restore the Peace of the Church which the Heresie of <hi>Arius,</hi> and the Oriental and Western Churches about the time of keeping <hi>Easter</hi> had so danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously broken; and <hi>Eusebius</hi> tells us, that <hi>Constantine,</hi> at the opening it, earnestly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the Bishops, by their wise Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to settle all things in Quiet and Unity. And accordingly (says he in his new man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Speech) the Subject of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates turned upon these Two Points.<note place="margin">P. 48.</note>
                  </q>
But his History is every whit as new as his Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: for it has been hitherto thought, that (the <hi>Subject of their Debates,</hi> or rather) their <hi>Debates</hi> had turned on several other Points, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side these Two, particularly, that there were Twenty Canons framed and published by them; and, whatever becomes of the <hi>Arabick</hi> ones, yet that these were of confessed Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:48421:96"/>
And as willing as Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> is to overlook these Canons, I must take the liberty to put him in mind of them, especially of the Fifth, which provides for the frequent Sessions of Provincial Councils; without any Previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Application to the Emperor for his Leave to make such Provision. Nay, I find not in any of these Canons a word mentioned, either of the <hi>Arian</hi> Controversie, or that about <hi>Easter</hi>; the Decision of which was comprized in their Synodical Epistle: Does the Doctor think that they <hi>debated</hi> on nothing but what was the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of that Letter? or has he some secret Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story of their Acts, by which he can prove that <hi>Constantine</hi> offered these Canons to 'em ready drawn up, and that they passed the Synod by way of form only, without being discussed? If he can make this out, the Instance will be somewhat to his purpose; otherwise, it is fit to keep Company with those that follow.</p>

                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 49.</note>, and <hi>Chalcedon</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 51.</note>, where the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors had their Commissioners to preside in their stead. They had so; but in what manner, and to what Ends, let those Emperors themselves, in their Commissional Letters speak: it was <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, to secure Order and Regularity in their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, and with an Express Prohibition of their interposing in Matters Doctrinal, and such Points as were properly of Church-cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance. This is so beaten a Theme, and the Answers to these objected Instances are so well known, that I should be ashamed to give 'em, were I not obliged to it by Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>; who is not ashamed to produce the Instances them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:48421:97"/>
without taking any notice of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers that have been an hundred times over made to 'em.</p>
               <p>Our Learned <hi>Mason</hi> long ago thus account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for these very Instances: The Lay-Presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, he says, in these Synods of <hi>Ephesus</hi> and <hi>Chalcedon</hi> was made use of for four Reasons.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>(1.) To hinder Strangers, who flocked thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and had no Right to Vote, from breaking in upon the Assembly.</item>
                  <item>(2.) To keep all the Members of the Synod together, till they had dispatched the business for which they met.</item>
                  <item>(3.) To see that Business first concluded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any new Point was started, and pursued.</item>
                  <item>(4.) To take care, that the private Piques and Resentments of any of the Members should not interrupt the Publick Work.</item>
               </list>
               <p>These were the Chief Ends, for which the Emperors had their Commissioners at those Meetings; and not, for the proposing to the Fathers the several successive Matters which they were to Deliberate on; much less, for the <hi>Confining 'em to deliberate on nothing but what they proposed.</hi> So far was that from being the Case, that the Eighth Canon of the <hi>Ephesine</hi> Council [occasioned by a Dispute about the <hi>Cyprian</hi> Priviledges] was plainly brought in, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, and concluded, by the Synod, without the least Interposition of the Civil Power:
And which of the Thirty Canons passed by the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Act. 15.</note> were not so, I desire Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> at his Leisure to inform us; and withal, with what assurance he could say, that <q>every New Matter [in that Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi>] is Prefaced with this Declaration,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:48421:97"/>
that they had <hi>obtained leave</hi> of the <hi>Emperors</hi> for the <hi>Fathers</hi> to <hi>consider</hi> of it, and that the Emperors Orders were delivered to the Commissioners,<note place="margin">Pag. 51.</note> to authorize the Bishops to enter upon it.</q>
—When not one of these Thirty Canons were thus <hi>Prefaced,</hi> or authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed? tho' some of them were of the Greatest Weight and Consequence; particularly the 28. which put the See of <hi>Constantinople</hi> upon the Level with that of <hi>Rome</hi>; and which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were so far from being authorized before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand to Treat on, and to pass, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners knew nothing of it till it had passed; and had it therefore read to 'em at their next Meeting, in order to their considering, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving it.</p>
               <p>To support this Gross Falsity, he quotes the 7<hi>th.</hi> 9<hi>th.</hi> 10<hi>th.</hi> and 11<hi>th.</hi> Actions of this Synod, where the New Matter, on which their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates proceed, is, he says, <hi>Prefaced with the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror's Leave</hi>: but it was not to his purpose to speak more plainly. For that New Matter was such, in which, it is likely, the Emperor had before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand been apply'd to, and interested himself: in which case, it was decent, if not necessary, to have his Consent, before it was presented to the Synod. It related to some Bishops, who had (as They urged) been Uncanonically deprived, and had probably sought the Emperor's Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the case. When the Council sat, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred 'em thither for Justice; and they might therefore, on this account, fitly mention the <hi>Imperial Leave,</hi> when their Business first came on. But let this be as it will, it is a Point of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48421:98"/>
                  <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> with which we are not at present concerned: The Canons of that Council it is certain had <hi>New Matter</hi> in them; and it is as certain, that none of that New Matter was <hi>Prefaced with the Emperor's Leave</hi>; and how Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> came to forget, both these and the <hi>Nicene</hi> Canons is matter of wonder. I had thought, the Decrees of Councils were the most Important and Sacred Part of their Acts; especially the Decrees of those four first General Councils, for which both the Church, and the Law of <hi>England</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Canon. <hi>Aelfrici.</hi> Can. 33. 1 Eliz. c. 1.</note> have, and have always had a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Veneration.</p>
               <p>But of All the Instances he has pitched up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to shew, that Synods can debate of nothing but what the Prince particularly proposes to 'em, commend me to those he urges (<hi>P.</hi> 54, 55.) from the Practice of <hi>Carloman,</hi> at the Synod of <hi>Leptines,</hi> and of <hi>Arnulph,</hi> at that of <hi>Trebur.</hi> The first of these says, he had call'd his Clergy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether <hi>to advise him how the Law of God, and the Religion of the Church, which had been suffered to fall into such decay, in the days of his Predecessors, might be restored.</hi> The second desires them <hi>to consider what they thought was needful to be done, for the Reformation of Mens Manners, for the Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Faith, and for the Preservation of the Unity of the Church.</hi> How could these Emperors possibly have expressed themselves in words that left their Synods more at large, or gave greater Scope to their Debates than these do? which yet Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> produces on purpose to shew, that the Prince prescribed to them the Particular Points, on which they were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. These are Ill Proofs indeed; but pity it is, that such Bad Notions should ever be sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by better.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:48421:98"/>Under the Prince's Power of suggesting any Subject of Debate to a Synod, I comprehend also his Power of <hi>proposing the Draught of a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> to them; for that too he has sometimes done; but without <hi>confining</hi> 'em to pass such Canons in the Form prescribed: which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, he has never done, nor has any Right to do, tho' Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> gives us very Broad Hints that he thinks otherwise; and to that End produces the
<q>Three Ecclesiastical Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which <hi>Marcian</hi> delivered to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Fourth General Council at <hi>Chalcedon</hi> ready drawn up, to be approved by them; and they all (he says) gave their Unanimous Assent to 'em <note n="*" place="margin">P. 65.</note>.</q>
But he tells us not, as he might, that the <hi>Matter</hi> of these Canons was of such a mixt nature, as made it proper for the Emperor to interpose in them: nor does he inform us, with what words of high Respect and Deference he offered 'em to the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod. <hi>There are</hi> (says he) <hi>Three Points which in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to your Reverences we have reserved for you; judging it fit and decent, that they should rather be by You in Synod Canonically defined, than Enacted by our Temporal Laws</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Act. 6.</note>. And in what manner the Synod passed 'em is worth our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice: for it was neither in that Order, nor exactly in those Terms in which they were proposed. And one of them <note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>The Second.</hi>
                  </note> they put into differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent words, without any the least alteration of sense, mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as it should seem, to keep free of an Ill
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:48421:99"/>
Precedent, which by receiving the Emperor's Form they might have brought upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. So that this is a much better Proof, that the Emperor <hi>could not</hi> prescribe the Form of a Canon to them, than that he <hi>could.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor are his <hi>English</hi> Instances of this kind more to his purpose:
<q>Some of our Princes (he says) have not only prescribed to their Convocations what they should go about, but have <hi>actually drawn up before-hand</hi> what they thought <hi>convenient</hi> to be established, and have required them to approve of it <note n="*" place="margin">P. [110.]</note>.</q>
And for this he vouches King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Letter to the Convocation in 1603, <q>together with which he sent them the Articles of 1562, to be approved by 'em.</q>
A notable Instance of the Prince's Power <hi>actually to draw up before-hand</hi> what they think <hi>convenient</hi> to be establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by their Synods! because King <hi>Iames</hi> sent a Message to one of 'em, about Confirming the Thirty nine Articles, which had been actually drawn up by another Convocation, forty years before that Message was sent.</p>
               <p>And that this Point may be sure to be well proved, he adds a Second Instance of it, every whit as concluding as the Former,
<q>The same Prince, he says, to <hi>Another Convocation,</hi> about four years after, signified his Pleasure for Singing and Organ-service to be <hi>setled</hi> in Cathedral Churches, without submitting it to their judgment, whether they approved it, or no <note n="†" place="margin">Ibid.</note>.</q>
He tells us not from whence he dr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>w either this, or the former particular, and so I am not able to say how he has dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised them. But taking this last as he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented it, clear it is that the King in this
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:48421:99"/>
case did not <hi>form, or draw up any thing before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand</hi> for the Convocation to Sign, but only suggested the <hi>Matter of a Canon</hi> to them; and of such a Canon, as (if necessary) there was no doubt of their agreeing unanimously in, since it was only to confirm a received Practice: and therefore if he did not ask their Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was because he was sure of it.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> is in this Observation all over Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stake: For whereas he calls this <hi>Another Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation</hi> from that in 1603, it was certainly the same; That in 1603 being <hi>by Prorogations continued from Time to Time for seven years together,</hi> as his own words are, a few Pages afterwards <note n="*" place="margin">P. 142.</note>. Nor could the Import of this Message well be the <hi>Setling</hi> of Singing and Organ-service in Cathedral Churches; for it was setled there long before <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>At the Reforming of the Church, not only the King's Chappel and all Cathedrals, but many Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rochial Churches also had preser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved their Organs, to which they used to Sing the appointed Hymns, i. e. the</hi> Te Deum, <hi>the</hi> Benedictus, <hi>the</hi> Magnificat, <hi>the</hi> Nunc dimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, <hi>&amp;c. performed in an Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and Melodious manner.</hi>— Heylin. <hi>Hist. of Presbyt.</hi> p. 226.</note>. Only King <hi>Iames,</hi> I suppose, recommended to 'em the framing of a <hi>Canon</hi> in behalf of what was hitherto autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized by <hi>Practice</hi> alone, and by the <hi>Queen's Injunctions</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">Sparrow, <hi>p.</hi> 80.</note>. But this the Synod thought needless, the Thing being otherwise so well established already; and therefore fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med no Canon concerning it. How Ridiculous then is it in Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> to say, that the King <hi>sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified his Pleasure to them in this matter, without ever submitting it to their Iudgment whether they approved it or no?</hi> when the Event shews, that they disapproved, and did not comply with the Motion: for I never heard of any such Canon in behalf of Singing, and Organ-ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice;
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:48421:100"/>
and which is more, Bishop <hi>Sparrow</hi> never heard of it neither. If this Message there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make any thing for the King's Power of Proposing, it makes as strongly for the Clergy's Priviledge of denying, if they think fit; which is the very thing Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> is endeavouring in this place to deprive them of.</p>
               <p n="6">VI. A Sixth Observation I have to offer on Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s way of managing this Controversie is, that Those very Acts of Authority which were exercised by Princes in Ecclesiastical Matters, to support and corroborate the Churches Power, are by Him perversely made use of to undermine and destroy it. He finds that the Canons of the most General Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils have been confirmed by the <hi>Civil Power,</hi> and confirmed at the <hi>Instance</hi> and <hi>Petition</hi> of the Synods themselves <note n="*" place="margin">P. 80.</note>. And from hence he infers therefore that <hi>their Definitions are no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Obligatory, than as they are ratified by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Authority</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 79.</note>. And this Point he is so sure of, that he <hi>conceives it to be allowed on all hands</hi>; whereas I on the contrary conceive, that it is allowed on no hands; and is a Conclusion I am-sure, that neither agrees with <hi>the Principles of our Church,</hi> nor can ever be drawn from the <hi>Premisses</hi> on which he pretends to establish it.</p>
               <p>If this Doctrine be good, then is that of our Twentieth Article stark naught, which deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines, that <hi>the Church hath Power to decree Rites or Ceremonies, and Authority in Matters of Faith.</hi> But how has she <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Authority</hi> to this purpose, if her Synodical Decisions are in no
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:48421:100"/>
case <hi>farther Obligatory, than as they are ratified by the Civil Authority?</hi> The Magistrate at this rate, will have Power, but the Church her self can have none. For she speaks only by her Synods, in matters of this nature: and if therefore her Synodical Decrees have not any Authority of their own, till confirmed by the Prince, then under an Heathen or Heretical Prince, the Church has not, I say, any Authority, tho' the Article expresly says, that she <hi>has.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is very observable, that Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> has not in either of his Books mentioned this Article; which yet surely in a Controversie of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deserved to have been taken notice of. Such an Omission could not be by chance: and we must believe therefore, that he is of the Opinion of those Back-friends of ours in <hi>Charles</hi> the First's time, who would allow the former part of the Article no more Authority than Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> allows to the Church; but said it was deceitfully inserted by Archbishop <hi>Laud,</hi> and wanting in the Original. He might be ashamed to take up with this Reproach, after that Solemn <hi>Appeal,</hi> which the Archbishop in his Speech in the <hi>Star-chamber</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Anno 1637. <hi>See</hi> Heylin<hi>'s Life of</hi> Laud, p. 339.</note> made to the Records of Convocation, for the disproof of it. If he have any Suspicions still left in this matter, my Lord of <hi>Sarum,</hi> in his Late <hi>Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 26.</note>, will clear them. In the mean time let me put him in mind of the Fate of Dr. <hi>Moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi>'s Book <hi>de Doctrinâ &amp; Politeiâ Ecclesiae Angli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canae</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">In 4 <hi>to.</hi> London, 1617.</note>, which tho' writ by Archbishop <hi>Abbot</hi>'s direction, yet was <hi>Burned</hi> publickly; and that chiefly on the account of this very Omission, if Dr. <hi>Heylin</hi>'s History <note n="⸫" place="margin">
                     <hi>Life of</hi> Laud, p. 76</note> may be relyed on.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="166" facs="tcp:48421:101"/>But how comes he to dream it to be <hi>allowed on all Hands</hi> that Synodical Definitions are <hi>no farther Obligatory than they are ratified by the Civil Power?</hi> What Church upon Earth ever deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined or allowed this Doctrine? Because the Fathers of many Synods desir'd the Prince, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der whose Direction they met, to inforce their Decrees by Civil Sanctions and Penalties, does it follow, that therefore these Decrees with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Addition of the Civil Sanction would have had no Authority, no Force to oblige the Consciences of Christians? Does the Subse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Authority destroy the force of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent one? Is the one of these lost and swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in the other? At this rate, what will become of <hi>Excommunication,</hi> when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, as it is here with us, by a Civil Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? Has the Church Sentence in this case no Authority, because the Writ <hi>de Excommunicat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> capiendo</hi> is linked to it, and issues out upon it? Such arguing would have become a Disciple of <hi>Erastus</hi> much better than a Son of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But he will tell me Canons lose no Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in this case which they ever had, because indeed they never had any: the Great Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Church being only to prepare Draughts of Canons, and <hi>Dead Matter</hi> as it were for the Royal Stamp afterwards to put Life into. But if so, How shall we account for the Acts of Church-power exercised by Synods, from the first Planting of the Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, till the Empire turned Christian? It is plain, that the Governours of the Church for three hundred years before the Civil Power came in to assist them, met in Synods, and
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:48421:101"/>
made Laws, which were universally submitted to, not only as <hi>Councils</hi> or <hi>Advices</hi> proceeding from Men whose Character was had in great Reverence, but as the Commands of Lawful Superiors towards their Spiritual Subjects: and as such, they were understood to oblige the Consciences of all good Christians in those Ages. And if they had such an Authority before <hi>Constantine</hi>'s time, how came they to want it afterwards? As the Church could get no New Power by coming under the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the State, so how does it appear that she lost any Old one? The Emperors indeed by turning Christians gained something, to wit an Interest in the management of Ecclesiastical Affairs: but their Gains were not built on the Church-Governours Losses; the Power that by this means accrued to 'em was <hi>Accumulative</hi> not <hi>Privative; i. e.</hi> it gave them some Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which they had not, but it took not that away which the Spiritual Pastors and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours had. A Distinction, that I am not afraid to make use of, notwithstanding the Quarter it comes from!</p>
               <p>If Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> therefore denies the Definitions of Synods [held under the Civil Power] to have any other Authority than what they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from that Power, he by consequence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that the Anti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <hi>Nicene</hi> Fathers assembled in Synod, had any <hi>Right</hi> to prescribe Rules to those Christians that lived within the District over which they presided; or that those Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians were <hi>bound</hi> to obey 'em: He affirms in effect the several Canons that these Assemblies passed, the Censures that they pronounced, all the Acts of Synodical Authority which they
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:48421:102"/>
exercised to be in themselves Null and Void, and mere Usurpations upon the Liberty of Christians. And whether he will take up with these Scandalous Notions, or not, we shall see, when he blesses the World with his Next Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance: Sure I am that without 'em, his Scheme cannot be consistent, and of a piece.</p>
               <p>Agen, Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> is also very faulty on this Head, when in order to depress the Power of the Church, he promiscuosly enumerates all the Laws, framed by Princes about Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Affairs, without informing us which of those Laws only traced the steps of precedent Canons, and which of them proposed <hi>New</hi> Matter of Obedience, <hi>beside, or contrary</hi> to those Canons; which would in this case have been a very Material and Pertinent Distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He is full of the Edicts relating to Church-matters, that are to be met with in the Code of <hi>Theodosius,</hi> the Code and Novels of <hi>Iustinian,</hi> &amp;c. <note n="*" place="margin">P. 11.</note> But it would have been very honest of him here to have told us (as the Truth is) that there were scarce any of these Edicts, to which some Canon had not before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand led the way; and that All therefore that those Princes generally did, was to re-enact by the Civil what had been before enacted by the Ecclesiastical Authority; and to give the Church Decisions more weight and force by inserting 'em into the Body of the Imperial Laws, and annexing further Penalties to the Breach of them. This is so certain and known a Truth, that even at this day we can point out the several Canons upon which almost all the Civil Constitutions of those Princes were
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:48421:102"/>
founded; and in which the matter of 'em was either particularly and in Terms, or at large, and in general determined. And if in some few Instances we should not be able to do this, what wonder is it? when it is considered at what a Vast Distance of Time we live from the first Rise of these things, and how many Antient Church-Monuments that would have given light in these matters, have in the course of so many Ages perished? <hi>Iustinian</hi> in his Laws appeals frequently to the Canons, and professes to follow them <note n="*" place="margin">Nov. 6. c. 1. Ibid. §. 8. Nov. 58. sub finem. Nov. 123. c. 36.</note>. And by this Pattern the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Princes in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times framed their <hi>Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> taking the Subjects of them from the Resolutions of antecedent Synods <note n="†" place="margin">Decrevimus juxta Sancto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Canonum Regulas— Caroloman. in Syn. Leptin. Anno 747.</note>, and even <hi>referring themselves thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for the more clear understanding of what their Law only briefly and in General delivered</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">P. 91.</note>. A Truth so Notorious, that Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> himself durst not dissemble it! And it would puzzle a man therefore to shew, how such Laws should any ways derogate from the Authority of Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, which they took their rise from, and were made on purpose to support, and confirm. I must put the Doctor in mind here of a way of arguing made use of by one of his Seconds in this Controversie, where he is disputing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Universities Authority to declare Heresie: there he lays down this Position;
That,<q> the Convocation of the University of <hi>Oxford</hi> have never forbid any Doctrine to their Scholars, before that very particular Doctrine was first declared Erroneous, or

Heretical by some Persons who were then reputed to have Power to declare Heresie <note n="*" place="margin">L. M. P. p. 69.</note>.</q>
The Truth of this Assertion I at present trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble not my self with; but supposing it true, the Inference that arises from it has weight, I own; and when applied to our Present Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is of use to inform us, what Secular Decrees in Church-matters are no ways pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the Power of the Church, and the Authority of Synods. And this was an Head, I say, upon which Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> should have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained himself largely and openly, if he had intended a fair state of this Controversie, or had had any other New in what he wrote than merely to serve a Turn, and to advance some colourable kind of Plea for a Practice, which, if he knew any thing of these matters, he must know, was indefensible, and be writing all the while <hi>for</hi> his Point, <hi>against</hi> his Conscience: and if he knew nothing of it, with what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science could he undertake to determine it? These are words that I do not easily persuade my self to bestow on any Man: but his Gross Prevarications and Disguises of Truth in Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines of so great moment, wherein the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rests of his Order, and of Religion are so near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned, force this hard Language from me.</p>
               <p>Nor stops he at <hi>General</hi> Reflections in this case, but brings them home also to our own Church and Constitution; pretending in his <hi>Appendix</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Num. vii.</note> to give us <hi>an Abstract of several things relating to the Church, which have been done since the</hi> 25 Hen. 8. <hi>by Private Commissions, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, out of Convocation.</hi> In which Abstract many of the Points mentioned had certainly
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:48421:103"/>
the Authority of Convocation, tho' he would fain have us believe they had not; and that, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedently to the Civil Injunction: Others are such Acts of Ordinary Power, as by the consent of All Churches and Parties of Men every Christian Prince is confessedly intitled to: and some few perhaps might be owing to the Necessity of Affairs which would not then admit of more Regular Methods; and should not therefore be vouched as reasonable Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, and setled Rules and Standards of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in more quiet times; which is manifestly Dr. <hi>Wake's</hi> End in producing them.</p>
               <p>The Reader must forgive me, if I detain him so long, as to run through the Particulars of this List, and shew upon each of 'em, how far the Ecclesiastical Power concurred and led the way to it. It will be a dry unpleasing Task, but is of use to clear the Orderliness of some steps taken in those times, which are generally misunderstood; and is necessary to wipe off the Dirt thrown by Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> on the <hi>English Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation:</hi> the Process of which, I am satisfied, was very Regular, and Canonical in most Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, tho' in some, by reason of the Loss of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, it cannot easily be proved so. Of this we are in General assured by such as lived at the time when those Records were in being, particularly by Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Fuller.</hi>
The first in his <hi>Posthuma</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 215.</note>, has these words, <q>If any shall object that many Laws in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's time had first the Ground in Parliament, it is manifested by the Dates of their Acts in Convocation, that they All had in that place their first Original.</q> The Latter speaks, as follows:
<q>Upon serious
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:48421:104"/>
Examination it will appear, that there was nothing done in the Reformation of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, save what was acted by the Clergy in their Convocations, or Grounded on some Act of theirs precedent to it, with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, Counsel and Consent of the Bishops, and most Eminent Church-men; confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the <hi>Post-fact,</hi> and not otherwise; according to the Usage of the best and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Times of Christianity <note n="*" place="margin">Church-Hist. xvi. Cent. p. 188.</note>.</q>
To which I shall add the Testimony of one, who must be allowed a Good Witness in this case, my Lord of <hi>Sarum</hi>:
He assures the <hi>Bishop of Meaux,</hi> in the Answer he made to his <hi>Variations,</hi> that <q>Our Parliaments and Princes have not med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in matters of Religion any other way, but that they have given the Civil Sanction to the Propositions made by the Church: and this is that which Christian Princes do in all Places <note n="†" place="margin">P. 35.</note>.</q>
And in 1604, I find a <hi>Puritan</hi> Writer making this Challenge:
<q>Let them, if they can, shew any one Instance of any Change or Alteration, either from Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Superstition, or from Superstition to Religion to have been made in Parliament, unless the same freely and at large have been first agred upon in their Synods and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations <note n="‖" place="margin">Asserti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of True and Christian Policy. <hi>P.</hi> 168.</note>.</q>
Which is no otherwise consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, I own, than as it comes from the Pen of an Adversary. These are General Proofs, which would go a good way towards setting aside the Particulars in Dr. <hi>Wake's Abstract,</hi> if we had nothing more to say against 'em: But they shall be further and more distinctly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:48421:104"/>The Doctor took 'em, he says, out of his Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections as they lay there: and for these Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections, I find, he scarce ever goes further than Bishop <hi>Burnet</hi>'s History of the <hi>Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>; which tho' a very Excellent Work, and meriting the Thanks of <hi>Parliament,</hi> which it had; yet, as to the Proceedings of <hi>Convocation,</hi> and the share which the Ecclesiastical Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity bore all along in those Changes, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely defective; partly from the want of Records, and partly from his Lordship's omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to set down All even of that Little that is left us, on this Head, in the Manuscript Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs of that time: So that it is no Proof that nothing was done by the Clergy in such or such a Case, because his Lordship says nothing of it. Besides, that History is by its very Method apt to mislead an unwary Reader in Enquiries of this nature; the way of it being, to set down first the Proceedings of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in every case, and then those of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation: which makes it look oftentimes, as if the Parliament had led the way to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, in their Debates, when the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to that is most certainly true; and would have appeared so to be, had his Lordship thought fit to follow the Pattern set by <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitates Britannicae,</hi> and given the Precedence always to the Acts of Convocation, when the Business was first agitated there, and afterwards brought into Parliament: which, in a <hi>Church-Historian,</hi> had, I presume, been a method not improper or unbecoming. At least, since his Lordship could not but know, that our Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation had suffered by being misunderstood in these respects, it might not have been amiss to
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:48421:105"/>
have given us warning, when things were told out of the Natural Order of time in which they hapned, and in what Instances the Leading steps were from the Convocation, tho' the Course of his History seemed to place the rise of 'em elswhere. The want of this notice has occasioned Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s mistakes in some ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and in others he has not made use even of the Light which this History would have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him. I shall examine every Instance, any ways material, the <hi>Injunctions</hi> only excepted; which, it must be confessed, were by <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth, in vertue of their Supreme Headship, and under the shelter of that Act, which made the King's Proclamations equal to an Act of Parliament, Issued out in a very Arbitrary manner; and continued so to be, as long as our Princes could in their High Commission-Court take notice of the Breach of them. But since that Court has been put down, and the Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Acts of Spiritual Jurisdiction, annexed to the Imperial Crown of <hi>England</hi> by the First of <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> Chap. 1. can now be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised only in Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how far any Royal <hi>Injunction</hi> is valid, unless where by the Advice of the Metropolitan it orders such things as that Act directs and allows, or seconds some Authentick Canon, or Received Practice; and whether it has any greater force in Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siastical, than the King's <hi>Proclamation</hi> has in Civil Affairs, I leave to the Gentlemen of the Long Robe to determine. The Clergy, I am sure, are not the only Persons concerned in this point; for the Princes of those days car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried their Power further than Them, and issued
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48421:105"/>

               <p>He means the Book called <hi>The Institution of a Christian Man</hi>; but mistakes both the <hi>Time</hi> of its coming out, and its <hi>Title,</hi> and the <hi>Authority</hi> by which it was published. And in the first and last, of these that very Passage he cites, would have set him right, if he had heeded it. For thus it speaks:
<q>Tho' there was no Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in the Year 1537, yet there was a Convocation; upon the Conclusion of which there was Printed an Explanation of the chief Points of Religion, Signed by Nineteen Bishops, Eight Archdeacons, and Seventeen Doctors of Divinity and Law <note n="†" place="margin">Hist.

Here is no Intimation of its not passing the Convocation, but rather the contrary; Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty five of the Lower House subscribing it: which might well be a Majority of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, when not many years before, in the great Debate about the Divorce of Queen <hi>Cathari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Twenty three only (as we have heard alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note n="*" place="margin">P. 53.</note>) were present; and Fourteen of these Votes therefore made a Majority of that House. But <hi>Heylin,</hi> who had the Opportunity of exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining the Registers, puts this matter beyond a Probability; for he speaks every where <note n="†" place="margin">Ref. just. p. 11. &amp; p. 549.</note> of this Book as having passed the Convocation, and of these Twenty five as Subscribing it <hi>in the Name of all the rest of the Members.</hi> At least, if <hi>Heylin</hi>'s word may not be taken for it, yet Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s, I hope, may: And he, in his <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal</hi>

               <p>We see these Articles were so far from being <hi>wholly carried on</hi> by Parliament, that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it self thought not fit to Enact 'em, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out expressing in their Bill the previous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent of the Clergy in Convocation.</p>
               <p>Some Body seems to have told the Doctor thus much, before he wrote his <hi>Appeal</hi>; in a corner of which, among the <hi>Errata,</hi> he desires that <hi>these four Lines may be blotted out.</hi> Why he was so Particular in his Requests I cannot tell: but sure I am, that there are very few Lines in this whole Article of his <hi>Appendix,</hi> that do not deserve blotting out as much as They.</p>

And the reason of establishing 'em was, because the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to be discussed <q>requiring (as this very

               <p>These Committees therefore were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to sit in the Intervals of Parliament: and tho' they had a Power of concluding finally, yet they seldom, I suppose, did more than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare business to be laid before the Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when it sat.

<q>After most humble Commendations to your Grace, I have received this day Letters from my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> touching certain <hi>Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies,</hi> which the <hi>Bishops in the Convocation holden Anno Dom.</hi> 1542. agreed to make for stay of such Errors, as were then by Ignorant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons sparkeled among the People.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Second begins thus:
<q>I have received other Letters from my Lord of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> requiring the said <hi>Homilies, by vertue of a Convocation holden five years past:</hi> [He does not allow indeed, that the Homilies formally passed that Synod, for he adds] Wherein we communed of That, which took none ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect then, and much less needeth to be put in Execution, ne in my judgment cannot.</q>
But <hi>Cranmer,</hi> we see, was of another opinion, and thought these Homilies sufficiently autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riz'd by the Convocation of 1542; and that they wanted only to be confirmed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by the King; as they were in the <hi>Injunctions</hi> of that year. But should there be any thing wanting to the Authority of these Homilies, when first set out, that want was
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:48421:111"/>
made up, when they were subsequently rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Clergy in Convocation <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See Art. of</hi> 1552, <hi>&amp;</hi> 1562.</note>.</p>
               <p>L. M. P. has increased Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s Collections by an Instance or two of this date, which must not be neglected:
<q>Parliaments, he says, <hi>without the Concurrence of Convocations</hi> have learnedly argued and determined the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons about the Lawfulness of Priests Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and Communion in one kind <note n="†" place="margin">P. 16.</note>.</q>
As to the first of these, the <hi>Stat.</hi> 2 <hi>&amp;</hi> 3 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 21. does indeed determine this point; but it is in consequence, and almost in the very words, of the Determination of the Clergy in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation made the year before, which <hi>Arth. Harmar</hi> has Printed <note n="‖" place="margin">P. 170.</note>, and my Lord of <hi>Sarum</hi> has given a short account of <note n="⸫" place="margin">Vol. 2. p. 50.</note>, tho' with some mistakes in the Circumstances of it. For where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as his Lordship makes but Thirty five to have affirmed the Question, and but Four<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>een to have denied it; there were many more in ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther case, Fifty three in the first, and Twenty two in the latter <note n="*" place="margin">Synoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</note>. The Name also of the Prolocutor, who gathered these Votes, is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staken: for it was <hi>Io. Taylor</hi> Dean of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> not <hi>I. Tyler</hi>; who had been Prolocutor Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty two years before in the Convocation of 1515: where his Lordship takes notice of him <note n="†" place="margin">Vol. 1. p. 14.</note> with Indignation, for making a <hi>Partial Entry</hi> in the Journals of Parliament, on behalf of the Clergy, then contending with the Lay-power, about their Ecclesiastical Priviledges, which his Lordship says,
<q>
                     <hi>is no wonder</hi>; the Clark of the Parliament being at the same Time Speaker to the Lower House of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation </q>— tho', had not his Lordship thus judged, I should have been apt to have
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:48421:112"/>
thought this <hi>Entry Impartial,</hi> for the very same reason; because the Man that made it, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed equally to both the contending Parties:
Unless it shall be said, that Clergy-men are so blindly devoted to the Interests of their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that no other Tyes, or Views whatsoever can make 'em think indifferently, where That is concerned. But of this his Lordship's own Works are an Effectual Disproof.</p>
               <p>As to the other Point, about the <hi>Communion in both kinds,</hi> neither did the Parliament esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish that, <hi>without the Concurrence of Convocation:</hi> for tho' the Clause concerning it was brought into the House of Lords (by Bishop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> I suppose) <hi>Novemb.</hi> 24 <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Bishop</hi> Burn. <hi>Vol.</hi> 2. <hi>p.</hi> 41.</note>, yet it lay upon the Table, without being called for again, till the Clergy <hi>Decemb.</hi> 2. had Voted it in Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; after which, the very next day <note n="†" place="margin">Synoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia.</note>, it had a Second Reading.</p>

And agen, That<q> whatsoever is contained in our Book, either for Baptism, Sacrament, Mass, Confirmation, and Service in the Church, is by our Parliament established, <hi>by the whole Clergy agreed,</hi> yea by the <hi>Bishops</hi> of the Realm <hi>devised,</hi> by God's Word con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed <note n="‖" place="margin">P. 668. <hi>a.</hi>

                     <hi>Fox.</hi> Vol. 2. p. 701.</note>, affirm the same thing, somewhat more forcibly. The first of these is,
<q>Her Grace writeth that the Law made by Parliament is not worthy the Name of a Law, meaning the <hi>Statute for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <q>You shall say thereto.</q>
               <p>
                  <q>The Fault is great in any Subject to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow a Law of the King, a Law of the Realm, by long Study, free Disputation, and uniform Determination of <hi>the whole Clergy</hi> consulted, debated, concluded.</q>
               </p>
               <p>But above all most Express and Full to this purpose is the Assertion in a Letter of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. dated <hi>Iuly</hi> 23. <hi>Regni tertio,</hi> and entred in the Register of <hi>Bonner</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">F. 219. <hi>a.</hi>
                  </note>; it runs thus:
That<q> one Uniform Order for Common-Prayers and Administration of the Sacraments hath beyn
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:48421:113"/>
and is most Godly sette fourthe not onely by the Common Agreement and full Assent of the Nobility and Commons in the late Session of our late Parliament; but also by the lyke Assent of the <hi>Bysshopps</hi> in the same Parliament, and <hi>of all other's the Learned Men of this our Realm in their Synods and Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Provincial.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>I thought it worth my while to make good this Point, because it has by some been much doubted, and their Doubts have been counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by the <hi>Act</hi> 2 &amp; 3 <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 1. which establishes the Service-Book; and wherein there is mention only of <hi>the Archbishop of</hi> Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury, <hi>and certain of the most Learned and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet Bishops and other Learned Men of this Realm, appointed to compile it</hi>; but no Formal notice is taken of the <hi>Convocation</hi> that passed it. And the Proof I have given in this single Instance, will suggest to the Reader, that it might be so in General; and that several other Things done by this Select Committee, were probably approved afterwards in Convocation; tho' the Statutes, and other Records of that time should seem to mention the <hi>Committee</hi> only. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation-Records, which alone could have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us Full Light in this case are destroyed; and the chief way we now have of supplying this Defect is by Parallel Instances, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Reasonings: which Fair Men therefore will admit as good Evidence, for want of bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and not take advantage, as Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> does from the Destruction of such Records to deny that there ever were any. This is as if a Man should pretend to prove, that none of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of such or such a Parish were, in the Reign
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:48421:114"/>
of <hi>Edward</hi> the Sixth Christned, because per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the Old Parish-Registers are lost.</p>
               <q>This made way for the Act of 1548, <hi>p.</hi> 93. and 1551, <hi>p.</hi> 189.</q>
               <p>He means King <hi>Edward</hi>'s two Acts of Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity, which established the first and second Service-Book; and <hi>way</hi> therefore <hi>was made for them,</hi> not by this <hi>New Office of Communion,</hi> but by the <hi>Service-Books</hi> themselves: These, I have shewn, tho' the Work of a <hi>Committee,</hi> yet had the Authority of Convocation, inasmuch as the Convocation approved this Committee before-hand, and confirmed what was done by it afterwards. I have shewn it, I mean, of the One; and the Reader therefore, will easily believe, that the same Steps and Measures were observed as to the Other.</p>

               <q>The <hi>Forms</hi> of <hi>Ordination,</hi> appointed by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> ordered to be drawn up by a special <hi>Committee</hi> of <hi>Six Bishops,</hi> and <hi>Six Divines</hi> to be nam'd by the <hi>King.</hi> Ibid. <hi>p.</hi> 141, 143.</q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="tcp:48421:114"/>The true account of this is, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil had already appointed this <hi>Committee,</hi> at the Instance (as we may from former Precedents reasonably collect) of the <hi>Convocation</hi> it self then sitting: and of the Members of Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation therefore this Committee was composed, according to my Lord of <hi>Sarum</hi>'s account of it.
<q>Some Bishops and Divines (says he) <hi>brought now together by a Session of Parliament,</hi> were appointed to prepare a Book of Ordinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <note n="*" place="margin">Vol. 2. p. 140.</note>.</q>
The Session was likely to end, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore these Forms could be prepared, and the Parliament passed therefore a <hi>previous Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of them, as they had done in the case of the <hi>Necessary Erudition,</hi> in 1540 <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Stat. 32 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. cap. 25.</note>. Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> must have a very uncommon way of arguing, if he can draw any thing to the Prejudice of the Churches Power from such Instances as these, where such an Implicit Deference was paid to the Resolutions of the Clergy, as to Enact 'em, before the Parliament had seen 'em, and indeed before they were made.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>W.</hi> we see, does in this, and in every other step of this Article, appeal to my L. of <hi>S.</hi>'s Book, and would under the cover of his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship's Name put off all his Bad History, and Worse Opinions. It may not be amiss there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to give him the <hi>Iudgment</hi> of this Right Reverend Prelate clearly expressed, and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in another Piece <note n="‖" place="margin">Vind. of the Ord. of the Ch. of <hi>Engl.</hi>
                  </note>; and with that, to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance all these Doubtful and Uncertain Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities.</p>
               <p>His Lordship, speaking of the English <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> (the Point we are upon) and of the <hi>Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> that were afterwards made in it, has these words,
<q>It was indeed confirmed by the
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48421:115"/>
Authority of Parliament, and there was good reason to desire That, to give it the force of a <hi>Law</hi>: but the <hi>Authority</hi> of [the Book and] those Changes, is wholly to be derived from the <hi>Convocation,</hi> who only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulted about them, and made them. And the Parliament did take that care in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting them, that might shew, they did only add the force of a Law to them: for in pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing them it was ordered that the Book of Common-Prayer and Ordination should only be read over, (and even that was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried upon some Debate; for many, as I have been told, moved that the Book should be added to the Act, as it was sent to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament from the Convocation, without ever reading it: but that seemed Indecent and too Implicit to others) and there was no change made in a Tittle by Parliament. So that they only Enacted by a Law what the Convocation had done <note n="*" place="margin">Pp. 74, 75.</note>. And agen, <hi>As it were a Great Scandal on the first General Councils to say, that they had no Authority for what they did, but what they derived from the Civil Power;</hi> so is it no less unjust to say, because the <hi>Parliaments im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Here I must beg leave to say, that his Lordship's Expression is not Exact. The Parliament did not</hi> impower, <hi>but</hi> approve <hi>of them.</hi>
                     </note> some Persons to draw Forms for the more pure Administration of the Sacraments, and Enacted that these only should be lawfully used in this Realm, which is the <hi>Civil Sanction;</hi> that therefore these Persons had no other <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> for what they did. Was it ever heard of, that the <hi>Civil Sanction,</hi> which only makes any Constitution to have the force of a
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:48421:115"/>
                     <hi>Law,</hi> gives it another <hi>Authority</hi> than a <hi>Civil</hi> one? The Prelates, and other Divines, that compiled our Forms of Ordination, did it by vertue of the <hi>Authority</hi> they had from <hi>Christ,</hi> as Pastors of his Church, which did impower them to teach the People the pure Word of God, and to administer the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and perform all other Holy Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, according to the Scripture, the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the Primitive Church, and the Rules of Expediency and Reason; and this they ought to have done, tho' the Civil Power had opposed it: in which case their Duty had been to have submitted to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Severities and Persecutions they might have been put to, for the Name of <hi>Christ,</hi> or the Truth of his Gospel. But on the other hand, when it pleased God to turn the Hearts of those which had the Chief Power, to set forward this good Work, then they did, as they ought, with all thankfulness acknowledge so great a Blessing, and accept and improve the Authority of the Civil Power for adding the Sanction of a Law to the Reformation, in all the Parts and Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of it. So by the Authority they derived from <hi>Christ,</hi> and the Warrant they had from Scripture and the Primitive Church, these Prelates and Divines made those Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Changes in the <hi>Ordinal;</hi> and the King and the Parliament, who are vested with the Supreme Legislative Power, added their Authority to them, to make them ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory on the Subjects <note n="*" place="margin">Pp. 53, 54.</note>.</q>

we are now concerned in, the Authority of the <hi>English</hi> Ordinal, as for the General Use they may be of in setling the Dispute between Dr. <hi>W.</hi> and the Church, about the Distinction of the Two Powers Ecclesiastical, and Civil; and the Obligations we are under to the Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the one, antecedently to the Sanctions of the other.

               <p>This Act traced the Steps of the Rubrick, in the Common-Prayer-Book, relating to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Days; and ordered none to be kept Holy, but what had before-hand been so ordered to be kept by the Clergy in Convocations, only it added New Penalties.</p>

               <p>This <hi>Catechism</hi> was published with the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of 1552. and had, I suppose, the very same Convocational Authority which those had.

               <p>These Directions were for the silencing both Parties, and for preventing all <hi>Innovations</hi> upon
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:48421:117"/>
the Doctrine of the Church already Establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and such Directions, it is not only the Christian Magistrates <hi>Priviledge,</hi> but his <hi>Duty</hi> to prescribe: provided always, that he do it not with any such under-hand Views and Aims, as my Lord of <hi>Sarum</hi> represents K. <hi>Charles</hi> the First to have had in publishing His,—
<q>All Divines (says he) were by Proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on required not to Preach upon Those Heads: but <hi>those that favour'd the New Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions were encouraged, and the others were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed</hi>

I presume, this is no part of the Regal Supremacy, nor a Pattern fit to be imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated in succeeding Reigns: especially, if the case ever should be, as his Lordship further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, it was Then,—
<q>And unhappy Disputes (continues He) falling in at that time, concerning the <hi>Extent of the Royal Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative beyond Law,</hi> the <hi>Arminians</hi> having declared themselves highly for that, they were <hi>as much favoured at Court, as they were censured in Parliament.</hi>
                  </q>
If this were then really the case, we of This Age have reason to thank Heaven for reserving us for better Times, when the Interests of Prince and People are the same; and it can never therefore be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending Qualification of a Man, that he is for <hi>extending the Royal Prerogative beyond Law</hi>; nor intitle him to <hi>the favour of a Court,</hi> to be <hi>censured in Parliament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>These are the Instances, in which Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> has shewn himself very willing to blast the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Reformation, in order to assert an unreasonable Prerogative to the Crown, for which no good Prince will thank him. I have considered 'em throughout, and have proved, I
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:48421:118"/>
hope, that the History he brings to justifie his Principles is every whit as unjustifiable as the Principles themselves; and that they deserve therefore to keep Company with one another. In some of these Instances, Truth was so easie to be come at, that he must be thought to have missed it willingly, and to have judged it par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable to pervert History a little, in order to make his Complement with the better Grace.

                     <hi>Baluzii</hi> Vita <hi>Petri de Marca, &amp;c.</hi> in principio operis de Concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diâ Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerd. &amp; Imp. pp. 13, 14.</note> was named to the See of <hi>Thoulouse,</hi> but not quickly setled there, for want of his <hi>Bulls.</hi> To obtain them, he wrote a Letter to the Pope, full of Submission and Respect; and in it, took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to compare his own advancement to the See of <hi>Tholouse</hi> with that of <hi>Exuperius,</hi> former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bishop of that place: whom he made the same with <hi>Exuperius,</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> President, on purpose, that the Parallel might run the better (He himself having for some time presided in <hi>Catalonia</hi>); tho' he knew very well, they were two different Men. When this was obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to him, as an over-sight, or rather as a piece of Art, not very well becoming his Holy Character, he laughed at the Objection, and pitied the poor People that made it; who were so scrupulously silly, as to tye Men up
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:48421:118"/>
to strict Truth in such cases as these, and not able to distinguish between <hi>History</hi> and a <hi>Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> So that with the Writers in this Argument, it has been, it seems, a Fashion all along, to disguise Truth; and the bending of matters of fact to by-purposes, is a tried and approved Remedy for the <hi>Dispatch of Bulls.</hi> As a Key to all the false Stories vouched by Dr. <hi>W.</hi> I have added this true one: and should it happen not to be very pertinent, or entertaining, I have no Excuse to make to him on that head; 'tis but returning him a Freedom, which he has often before-hand taken with his Reader.</p>
               <p>I am sensible these Reflections of mine are running out into too great a Length, and shall therefore only name two or three more with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out enlarging much upon 'em.</p>
               <p n="7">VII. Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> makes no distinction between <hi>Absolute</hi> and <hi>Limited</hi> Princes, but produces the Acts of the one to prove and justifie the Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise of a like Power in the other. His first Chapter is taken up in telling us, what was done in relation to Ecclesiastical Synods, and Affairs by the <hi>Roman,</hi> and <hi>German</hi> Emperors, and by other Princes, of narrower Territory, but not less Despotick in their Government: as if what <hi>They</hi> did, or had a Right to do, were immediately the Right of every other Christian Prince, without any regard to the Restrictions which the Power of that Prince might be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by the Constitution of his Country. But now should he have told us, what Acts of Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Authority were exercised by those Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors in <hi>State</hi>-matters, and how their Edicts had the force of Laws; would this Plea justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48421:119"/>
an <hi>English</hi> Prince in attempting the like things at home, or be a Bar any ways upon the Rights and Priviledges of Parliament? Indeed our Author seems sensible, that these Instances are not very Conclusive, where he confesses, <hi>that Princes may by their own Acts Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themselves,</hi> and that such Limitations may alter the Case mightily, and make that Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in one Country which is not so in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <note n="*" place="margin">P. 95.</note>. Pity it is, that this Truth had not come into his Thoughts sooner than the 95<hi>th.</hi> Page of his Work: it might then have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed with him to withdraw that huge Heap of Foreign Precedents, which now take up so much room in his Work; and which would have been left to sleep peaceably in his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place-Book, without seeing the Light, upon so improper an occasion. For should, what he has the Courage in his next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to assert, be true; that, <hi>by our own Consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, the King of</hi> England <hi>has all that Power at this day, over our Convocation, that</hi> EVER ANY <hi>Christian Prince had over his Synod</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 98.</note>: yet the Power he has in this respect, he derives from the Particular Rules of our Constitution, not from any <hi>beyond-Sea-Customs</hi> and Usages. He claims it not, I suppose, as Heir to the Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Authority of <hi>Constantine,</hi> or <hi>Charles</hi> the Great; but by vertue of that Prerogative, which, as King of <hi>England,</hi> he has by the Laws of <hi>England</hi>: and should the Power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore happen to be equal here <hi>at home</hi> to what it is <hi>abroad,</hi> yet there lyes no <hi>Proof</hi> from the one of these to the other. Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> it seems has different notions of these things; for he tells us, that
<q>Whatever Priviledges he has shewn
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:48421:119"/>
to belong to the Christian Magistrate, they belong to him <hi>as such</hi>; they are not derived from any <hi>Positive Laws and Constitutions,</hi> but result from that <hi>Power</hi> which every such Prince has <hi>Originally in himself,</hi> and are to be looked upon as part of those Rights which naturally belong to Sovereign Authority: and that, to prove any particular Prince en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to these Rights, it is sufficient to shew, that he is a Sovereign Prince; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be denied any of those Prerogatives that belong to such a Prince, unless it can be plainly made out, that he has afterwards, <hi>by his own Act, Limited him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Pp. 94, 95.</note>.</q>
So that, according to Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liticks, All Kings, in All Countries, have an Equal Share of Power, in their <hi>first Institution</hi>; none of 'em being <hi>Originally</hi> Limited, or sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to any Restraints, in the Arbitrary Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise of their Authority, but such as they have been pleased, by after-acts and conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scensions, graciously to lay upon themselves. Which Position how it can be reconciled with an <hi>Original Contract,</hi> and with several Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Late <hi>Declaration of Rights,</hi> I do not see: and how far it may appear to the Three States of this Realm, to entrench on their share in the Government, and on the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Rights and Liberties of the Free Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>England,</hi> Time must shew. That all <hi>Bishops</hi> indeed are Equal, is the known Maxim of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>; but which of the Fathers have said, that All <hi>Kings</hi> are so too, I am, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fess, as yet to learn. For my part, I should think it as easie a Task to prove, that every Prince had originally the same Extent of Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:48421:120"/>
as that he had the same Degree of Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: The <hi>Scales of Miles</hi> in several Countries are not more different, than the Measures of Power and Priviledge that belong to the Prince, and to the Subject. But Dr. <hi>W.</hi> has breathed <hi>French</hi> Air for some time of his Life, where such Arbitrary Schemes are in request; and it appears that his <hi>Travels</hi> have not been lost up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. He has put 'em to that Use, which a Modern Author <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Molds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth</hi>'s Pref. to the State of <hi>Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.</hi>
                  </note> observes to be too often made of 'em, that they teach Men <hi>fit Methods of pleasing their Sovereigns at the Peoples Expence:</hi> tho' at present, I trust, his Doctrine is a little out of season; when we live under a Prince, who will not be pleased with any thing that is Injurious to the Rights of the Least of his Subjects, when duly informed of them.</p>
               <p>Whereas then Dr. <hi>W.</hi> in great Friendship to the Liberties of his Church, and of his Country, asserts, that <hi>by our Constitution the King of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>has all that Power at this day over our Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, that</hi> EVER ANY <hi>Christian Prince had over his Synod</hi>; I would ask him one plain Question, Whether the King and the Three States of the Realm together have not more Power in Church-matters, and over Church-Synods than the <hi>King alone?</hi> If so, then cannot the King alone have <hi>All</hi> that Power which <hi>ever any</hi> Christian Prince had; because some Christian Princes have had all the Power that was possible; even as much as belongs to the King and the Three Estates in Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p>There is one thing indeed which seems ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial to be observed and owned in this case; 'tis the Assertion of the Second Canon, which
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48421:120"/>
declares our Kings to have <hi>the same Authority in Causes Ecclesiastical that the Christian Emperours in the Primitive Church had.</hi> But this Canon must necessarily be understood of the <hi>King in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for out of Parliament</hi> it is manifest, that he is not so Absolute in Ecclesiastical Matters, as those Emperors were. <hi>In</hi> Parliament, he can do every thing, that is by the Law of God, or of Reason lawful to be done; <hi>out of</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he can do nothing, but what the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Rules of our Constitution allow of. And,</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. This too is a Distinction which Dr. <hi>W.</hi> should have taken notice of, had he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to do Justice to his Argument. For the Church here in <hi>England</hi> is under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of the <hi>Absolute,</hi> and <hi>Limited Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign:</hi> under the Government of the Limited Sovereign, within the Compass of his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative; under the Government of the Abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Sovereign, without any Restraints or Bounds; except what the Revealed Will of God, and the Eternal Rules of Right Reason prescribe. The Pope usurped not only on the King, the Limited; but on the King and Parliament, the Absolute Sovereign: and what was taken from Him therefore was not all thrown into the Prerogative, but restored seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to its respective Owners.</p>
               <p>And of this Absolute Sovereign it is the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when Christian, to act in a Christian man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; to be directed in matters Spiritual by the Advice of Spiritual Persons, and not lightly to vary from it. By the same Rule the Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Sovereign is to steer likewise, within the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:48421:121"/>
Sphere of his Prerogative: And he is also fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther obliged, to preserve those Priviledges of the Church which belong to her by the Laws of the Realm. Now Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> I say, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds these two Powers, and the Subjections that are due to them; speaking all along of the King, as if He, in Exclusion to the Three Estates, had the Plenitude of Ecclesiastical Authority lodged in him, and were the single Point, in which the Obedience of the Church, and of every Member of it centered. This is a Fundamental Mistake that runs quite through his Book; and is such an One as overturns our Constitution, and confounds the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and Legislative parts of it; and deserves a Reprehension therefore some other way than from the Pen of an Adversary.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, 'tis true, in vertue of his Supreme Headship, laid claim to a Vast and Boundless Power in Church-affairs; had his <hi>Vicegerent</hi> in Convocation, Enacted every thing there by his own Sole Authority; issuing out <hi>his Injunctions</hi> as <hi>Laws,</hi> at pleasure. And these Powers, whether of Right belonging to him, or not, were then submitted to by All, who either wished ill to the Pope, or well to the Reformation; or wanted Courage otherwise to bear up against his Tyrannical Temper and Designs: and were the more easily allowed of by Church-men, because they saw him at the same time exercise as Extravagant an Authority in State-matters, by the Consent of his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in which the Crown is <hi>Arbitrary,</hi> and those in which it is purely <hi>Ministerial</hi>; between Royal Acts that are <hi>Free,</hi> and such as are <hi>Necessary,</hi> so that by the Rules of our Constitution the King cannot omit them. For example, he tells us, That the King determines what <hi>Persons</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 103.</note> shall meet in Convocation, at what <hi>Time</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 103.</note>, and in what <hi>Place.</hi> And this he talks of in such a manner, as if the Prince were perfectly and equally at Liberty, in all these Respects; and under no manner of Tye from the Laws and Usages of this Kingdom. 'Tis true, as to the <hi>Place</hi> of their Meeting, he is free, and may appoint their Session in what part of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try he thinks fit; just as he may that of the Lords and Commons. But as to the <hi>Time,</hi> he is so far restrain'd, that some Times there are when he <hi>ought</hi> to call them together, by the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Rules of our Constitution; and those are as often as Writs for a New Parliament go out. As for the other Convocations in the Intervals of Parliament (if our Constitution now, after an hundred and fifty years disuse, knows any such thing, which I shall not here dispute;) 'tis as to These only, that the Issuing out Writs for the Clergy can be matter of Grace and Favour, or become the Subject of Deliberati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But as to the <hi>Persons</hi> that are to meet, the Crown has no Power of determining who, or how many they shall be; for the Law has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined this before-hand. The King may indeed name whom he pleases to <hi>Deaneries</hi> and <hi>Bishopricks:</hi> but when he has done so, Those,
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:48421:122"/>
and no other must be Summoned to Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And in this he does not seem to have left himself at so much Liberty, as he still has in relation to the <hi>House of Lords,</hi> to which he can by Writ call whom he pleases, whereas it may be questioned, whether his Writ can give place to any one in the Upper House of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, but Bishops only.</p>
               <p>The Truth is, the King appoints the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that are to come to <hi>Convocation,</hi> just as he does those that are to come to <hi>Parliament:</hi> some have a Right of sitting there in <hi>Person,</hi> and to those therefore he directs Particular Writs; Others have a Right of being <hi>represent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> there, and those therefore he orders to send up their <hi>Proxies</hi>; that is indeed, the <hi>Constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> appoints, what Persons, or Communities shall be Summon'd; and the King, according to that Rule, does, as often as he is pleas'd to call a Parliament, by his Ministers, Execute that Summons. And if <hi>Convocations</hi> are upon the Level with <hi>Parliaments</hi> in this respect, as 'tis certain they are, Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> had best have a care how he attempts to prove, that it is the King's Right to appoint who shall come to those meetings, because this implies, that if he should think fit not to appoint 'em, they would have no Right to come: which is a Doctrine of very dangerous consequence, and not like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to recommend the maintainer of it to the Thanks of either House of Parliament.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> is not content to assert this Power to the King, unless he does it upon the bottom of an <hi>Imperial Power:</hi> for after he has prov'd, as he thinks, in his First Chapter, that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> were <hi>Absolute</hi> in

all these respects, he goes on in his Second to shew, that <hi>by our own Constitution, the King of</hi> England <hi>has all that Power at this day over our Convocation, that ever any Christian Prince had over his Synods</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 98.</note>; and immediately in the same Particulars of <hi>Time, Place,</hi> and <hi>Person,</hi> draws the Parallel between 'em.</p>
               <p>'Tis true as to <hi>Place,</hi> the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are as Arbitrary as those Emperors were: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his way of making out this both of the One and the Other is somewhat singular. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, <hi>Pepin</hi>'s determining the <hi>Place</hi> of his Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods meeting is prov'd, from his <hi>determining that they should meet either at</hi> Soissons, <hi>or at such other place as the Bishops should agree upon</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 38.</note>. At home, the same thing manifestly appears, because our Princes <hi>leave their Synods, with a Great Latitude, to be held either at St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s, or at any other Place, which the Archbishop shall judge to be more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">P. 103.</note>. Which is very true, for the words of the Writ to the Archbishop have for some hundred years run, <hi>ad conveniendum in Ecclesia,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>vel alib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>He has much such another Argument to prove that the Emperors determined the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> too, that were to come to their Great Councils; because in Three of them (which he there mentions) they <hi>left it to the Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,</hi> when they came, <hi>to bring such of their Suffragan Bishops as they thought fit along with 'em. And when the Princes</hi> (says he) <hi>who followed after, Summon'd their National Synods, They</hi> in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>directed the Choice of those who were to come to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:48421:123"/>
them</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Pp. 39, 40.</note>. If they directed the Choice <hi>in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> I may venture to say, that they did not direct it at all: for those Emperors gave no Directions for the Choice, but, as He says, left it intirely to the Discretion of the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan; or rather, as the Truth is, left it to the several Provincial Synods to determine, what Bishops should wait upon their Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop to the Council. Were Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s <hi>Conge d'estire</hi> to be so drawn up, as to leave the <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> to which it shall be sent, at as great a Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as these Princes left their Metropolitans, he would not think it, I believe, a sufficient Direction of their Choice, because, I dare say, he would not find it so. In the mean time, what Bungling Work is this for an Old Controvertist, that has encountred the Bishop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> and half persuaded him to be a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant? The Dr. indeed lets us know plainly enough, what he would be at, in the <hi>Positi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> he lays down; but by the <hi>Instances</hi> he some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times brings to back 'em, one can hardly tell, which side he is retain'd on.</p>

               <head>CHAP. V.</head>
               <p>HItherto, I have made only some General Remarks on Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s way of managing this Controversie, and by that means shew'd the Reader, how much there is in his Loose Work utterly wide of the Mark he should have aim'd at; and how unfair he is in his Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sentations, and defective in his Proofs, even on those Points which are not pertinent, and where Truth had been of little or no disservice to his Cause. I might go on, and in the same manner lay open his Fourth Chapter also, which he calls <hi>a Short View</hi> of the State of our Convocation in times past <note n="*" place="margin">P. 147.</note>; and which is just as <hi>short</hi> a View, as it is a <hi>True</hi> one: it being drawn out to the length of an hundred tedious Pages; in which there is scarce One (I speak what I have considered) that would not, upon a careful Review, yield a manifest Proof of his Insincerity or Ignorance. So slight and partial are the accounts he there gives of the Business of Convocations, and the Ends of assembling them; so false are his Allegations often times, and so weak the Inferences he draws from them; such an Implicit Relyance has he on every Relation he meets with in any of the Monkish Chroniclers, and so willing is he to think it as Exact and Full, as if the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors had written Just Histories of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Affairs, and not Lean Journals only; so tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly in the dark does he appear every where to be as to all those Manuscript Papers and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords that might be of use to clear up this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troversie;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:48421:124"/>
so base and untrue are the Aspersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons he casts on some of the best Clergy-men of those times, and (where he can) on his Whole Order; so mean and fulsome is the Flattery he bestows on the Memory of some of our Worst and most Arbitrary Princes: Upon all these Accounts, I say, and many more than these, Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> has left so much room for Censure, that it would be the busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of one entire Book to set out the Mistakes and Prevarications of that single Chapter. But in this, I shall rather trust the Reader to believe as he pleases, than tire him with a proof of it: especially, since opportunity will be given me of displaying some of them, here and there, under the following Heads of Matter I have mark'd out, and according to the Method I have resolved to proceed in. By That I am now led to consider the <hi>Exceptious</hi> of all sorts that have been taken at the Two Points assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Entrance of this Work, by any of those Writers who have pretended to answer the <hi>Letter to a Convocation-man</hi> We have hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to done little more than set aside what in Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s Book is foreign to the Argument he treats of; let us see now, what there is either in That, or any other Piece, written on the same side, that can be thought Material: I shall conceal nothing that may seem in the least to affect the Truth I contend for, or the Proofs which I have brought to support it.</p>
               <p>In Relation to the first Point laid down we are told, that the <hi>Provincial Writ,</hi> by which a Convocation is Summon'd, <hi>has no relation to the calling of a Parliament, nor does so much as mention
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48421:125"/>
it</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">L. M. P. p. 29, 30.</note>; That by such Writs <hi>the Clergy may be as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled, when no Parliament is in being, may meet before the Parliament, and be continu'd after the Dissolution of it</hi>; That as to the Clause, <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munientes,</hi> in the Bishops Writ, it is matter of Form only, <hi>having stood there these three hundred Years without any manner of use</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">Ibid. p. 32.</note>, and referring to <hi>a Convocation, which for many Years past has had no Existence</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">W. p. (284.)</note>; That <hi>it was first inserted upon some Particular Occasion, and continu'd after the Cause was determin'd</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">L. M. P. p. 32.</note>; and that, merely <hi>by the neglect of a Clark,</hi> as my Lord of <hi>Sarum</hi> conjectures <note n="‖" place="margin">Hist. Ref. Vol. 2. p. 49.</note>; That upon the whole therefore the Time of the Convocations meeting is no ways fix'd, but <hi>Precarious</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">L. M. P. p. 27.</note>, and it's <hi>Iust Definition is, an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional Assembly for such Purposes as the King shall direct, when they meet</hi>—as a late <hi>Little</hi> Author <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Nicolson.</hi> Hist. Libr. Vol. 3. p. 200.</note> has told us out of a <hi>Great</hi> one.</p>
               <p>But let the Definition come from what Hand it will, I must be bold to say, that it is unskilfully drawn. For from the Accounts al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given in these Papers it appears, that the Convocation is not an <hi>Occasional,</hi> but a <hi>Stated</hi> Assembly; in some measure Stated, as a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Synod, simply</hi> in it self considered; much more so, as a Synod <hi>attendant on a Parliament.</hi> As a Provincial Council, the Rules of the Church, receiv'd in all Christian States, and particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ours, direct that it should be <hi>Annual:</hi> As a Synod attendant on the Parliament, it has the same stated times of assembling that the Parliament has. And such Parliamentary Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the Clergy ought the rather to be kept up, because it was from These that the Disuse of yearly Provincial Councils, here and else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, originally sprung. For when through
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:48421:125"/>
the Piety of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Ancestors the Clergy were call'd to the Great Councils of the Realm, and made a constant and necessary part of them; they were oblig'd so frequently to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend in that Capacity, that they had neither Leisure, nor Need to observe the set times of their Provincial Assemblies. The Ordinary Business of These was dispatch'd at those State-meetings; which were frequent, and gave the Clergy the Opportunity of an easie Recourse to the Civil Power for a Confirmation of their Decrees. And this, by degrees, brought on a discontinuance of Provincial Synods, which from thence began to meet only on Great Emergencies, and for Extraordinary Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Thus the matter stood throughout the <hi>Saxon</hi> Times, and for some Reigns after the <hi>Conquest</hi>: The Clergy of the whole Realm met Nationally with the Laity, and did Church-business at the same Time and Place that the Great Affairs of the State were transacted. Afterwards it was thought more Regular, that they should attend the Parliament, not in one Body, but in Two Provincial Synods; which would equally answer the State-Ends of assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling them, and would withall be more strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agreeable to the Canons. Accordingly they have for near 400. years past constantly thus attended; and are therefore in this respect as <hi>stated</hi> an Assembly, as the Parliament it self. 'Tis true, there have been during this Period, Other Meetings also of the Clergy out of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament time, when the Necessities of the Church so requir'd; and these Assemblies in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (and these alone) were properly <hi>Occasion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al.</hi> But these were rare in comparison of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:48421:126"/>
Synods, even in Popish times: and since the Reformation there has been no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of 'em, the Convocation of 1640. on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excepted; which is no Compleat Instance neither: for it was call'd, and sat <hi>together with</hi> the Parliament, tho' it continued <hi>after</hi> it. And what Reflections and Votes this Continuance produc'd in the Succeeding Parliament, is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known. Setting aside therefore what was done in this disputed Instance, it is certain, that All the Business of the Church has for these hundred and fifty years last been trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted purely in Parliamentary Convocations: and these therefore (which are the only Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods now in use) being <hi>Stated,</hi> and not <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional,</hi> it can be no part of the <hi>Definition</hi> of a Convocation, that it is an <hi>Occasional Assembly.</hi> By the Universal Rules and Practice of the Church there are Set-times allotted for Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Synods to meet; and these Times are by our Constitution adjusted to those of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And the Clergy-Meetings therefore thus appointed concurrently with Parliaments can no more be said to be <hi>Precarious,</hi> or <hi>Occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal</hi> than They are. 'Tis true, their Acting is <hi>Occasional,</hi> tho' their Meeting <hi>and Sitting</hi> be not: for they may possibly, when met, have no Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness to do; and then, as they met a course, so they adjourn, or are adjourn'd a course: but the Chance of their acting, or not acting, ought not any ways to hinder their Meeting and Sitting, both because it cannot certainly be known till they are met, whether there be any Business for 'em, or no; and should there not be any, yet they preserve a Right to do Business, when there shall be occasion for it,
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:48421:126"/>
by thus assembling when there is none. Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Parker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cambden,</hi> Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi> all that have been Eminent for their skill in our Constitution, have constantly represented the Convocation to be a fixed and stated Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and never once dreamt that it was <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sional:</hi> and one would wonder therefore how our Young Antiquaries came to be wiser in this respect than the Old ones. No! this Meeting is not <hi>Occasional,</hi> but the Notion is taken up purely to serve a Turn, and do Business: for there must be New Notions to justifie New Usages. But (to speak a plain word) I cannot for my heart like these Men of <hi>Occasional</hi> Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: for I remember well that Those were thought thoroughly Honest by neither side, who were for <hi>Occasional Communion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus much in answer to the General Part of the Objection, which would persuade us, that 'tis of the Nature of a Convocation to be a <hi>Precarious</hi> Assembly: what is further urg'd to support this Notion, shall be consider'd under Two Heads, wherein I shall shew,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Praemunientes</hi> in the Bishops Writ, is not an Idle Useless Clause (as we are made to believe) inserted only on a Particular Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, and continu'd by Accident; but a Real, and (heretofore at least) an Effectual Summons of the Clergy to Parliament; such as they constantly made Formal Returns to, as often as it went out, and did expresly obey.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That the Writ to the Two Archbishops to convene the Clergy of their Provinces, tho' it does not expresly <hi>mention</hi> a Parliament, yet has an immediate <hi>Reference</hi> to it: the Original Design of its issuing out together with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48421:127"/>
Writ being only to secure an Obedience to the Premunitory Clause of it, and to make the Clergy's Parliamentary Assemblies more full and certain.</p>
               <p>Upon the first of these Points I shall not content my self barely to make good what I propose; but shall extend my Enquiries fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and endeavour to give some account of the Original of the <hi>Premunitory</hi> Clause, as it now stands in the Bishops Writ, of the true Grounds of inserting it, and of the steps by which it prevail'd.</p>
               <p>Something not unlike it I find practis'd as early as the Sixth of King <hi>Iohn,</hi> when a Writ, yet to be seen among our Records <note n="†" place="margin">Cl. 6 Joh. m. 3. dors.</note>, went out, calling the Bishops to Parliament, and <hi>by them</hi> all the Conventual <hi>Abbots</hi> and <hi>Priors</hi> of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cese; that is, it may be, all those of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy below Bishops, who might, in this Instance, be Summon'd to Parliament. Ten years after this the Charter of <hi>Runnymead</hi> oblig'd the Crown to Summon every Bishop, Baron, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, and Prior, <hi>Singillatim,</hi> that is, by a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Writ: and accordingly in the 26 <hi>H.</hi> 3. <note n="*" place="margin">Cl. m. 13. dors.</note> the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi>'s Summons has no such Clause in it; the Abbots being then, we may presume, Summon'd severally; as we are sure they were in the 41<hi>st.</hi> of the same Prince, from the Abbot of <hi>Burton</hi>'s Summons, preserv'd in the Annals of that Monastery <note n="‖" place="margin">P. 371.</note>, and as the <hi>Deans</hi> appear to have been in the 49 <hi>H.</hi> 3.<note n="*" place="margin">Dugd. Summ. p. 2.</note> And whether the Clergy of yet Lower Rank came to that Famous Meeting in some proportion answerable to that of the Lower Laity, and in what manner they were Summon'd thither, can be matter of Guess only; for our Records are silent.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:48421:127"/>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> the First, a Martial Prince, having great Designs abroad, had consequently need of Great Supplies at home; and in order to obtain them quietly, found it requisite to get the Express Consent of as many of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects as he could to the Parliamentary Grants; and for that End resolv'd to make the Lower Clergy and Laity a constant and standing Part of All his Parliaments.</p>
               <p>In his first year, while he was yet abroad in his Expedition, we find the <hi>Commons</hi> (as we now understand the word) present in Parliament <note n="*" place="margin">de quolibet Comitatu Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuor milites, &amp; de qualibet Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitate Quatuor. Ann. <hi>Wav.</hi> p. 227.</note>; and that in a greater number than they were in the 49<hi>th.</hi> of his Father. But it does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that the Inferior Clergy were at this Meeting; who, it seems, standing upon their Priviledges and Exemptions, were not so easie to be dealt with in this respect as those of the Laity were. In his third year therefore we hear only of the <hi>Pontifices, &amp; Cleri Majores</hi> in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment [<hi>i. e.</hi> of the Bishops, Abbats, Priors, and Archdeacons]; of whom the King demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Subsidy was answer'd by the Bishops, that they could not agree to it, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sulting the Clergy of their Dioceses;<note place="margin">

               <p>In his Seventh year the Council of <hi>Reding</hi> met, wherein it was order'd that two Proctors should be Elected by the Clergy of every Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cese, and sent up to represent them in the <hi>next Congregation of the Clergy to be held with the next

                  </note>. Whether Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Peckam</hi> found, that the King had resolv'd to bring these Proctors to Parliament by his Own Authority, and therefore prevented him by this Constitution, or whether he did it, to have their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel and Assistance in opposing the Statute of <hi>Mortmain,</hi> which he foresaw would be attempted in that Parliament (and was accordingly carried); or upon what other View he acted, I pretend not to say. But from thence forward I take it for granted that such Proctors were constantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to all the Clergy's Parliamentary Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and that purely upon an Ecclesiastical Call at first, tho' the King soon let himself in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a share in Convening them.</p>
               <p>For in his Ninth year, His and the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's Authority were joyntly and interchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably employ'd in it; the Archbishop signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King's Pleasure in his Letters Manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory to the Clergy, and the King on the other side Executing the Archbishop's Mandate by his Own Ministers. The Case (if my Collections deceive me not) was thus: The Bishops [and their Clergy] were Summon'd to a Synod at <hi>London</hi> by an Injunction from the Archbishop in which they were commanded also to meet at another Time and Place appointed by the King: and that they might be sure so to do, Letters of Citation are directed (not to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of <hi>London,</hi> but) to the King himself, to be by him communicated to the several Bishops by Royal Messengers.

Accordingly their Meeting at <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton</hi> was but thin, and they brake up imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, referring themselves to a Fuller Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; to be call'd in the usual Form by the Archbishop, and refusing to answer the King's Demands till such an one were Summon'd; as it was soon afterwards <note n="‖" place="margin">

               <p>Had the King's Writ, which call'd the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy before his Commissioners at <hi>Northampton</hi> been obey'd readily, the way had been open'd towards his bringing the <hi>whole Body</hi> of 'em af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to Parliament. But having fail'd in this, and such like attempts, and finding that the Archbishop and his Clergy understood one another, and were secretly agreed to defeat him, he afterwards went more roundly to work, and without asking help from the Church, was resolv'd to use only his Own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and accordingly Summon'd all the Great Abbats and Priors to Parliament Person<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as well those who did not hold of him by Barony, as those who did; and the Lower Clergy by a <hi>Premunitory</hi> Clause inserted in the Writ to every Bishop.

which a Fragment is published by Mr. <hi>Wharton</hi> (<hi>Angl. Sac. Vol.</hi> 1. <hi>p.</hi> 50.) and so <hi>Thorn. Rex apud S. Edm. tenuit Parliamentum, Convocato illùc Toto Clero. Col.</hi> 1965. Now therefore the <hi>Praemuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes</hi> became an Usual Part of the Bishop's Writ, and had a place there, not as Matter of Form only; for as often as it was repeated, it was expresly comply'd with. The Bishop, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Receipt of his Writ, transmitted it in a Letter of his own to the Dean or Prior of his Cathedral Church, and to the Archdeacon or Archdeacons of his Diocese, commanding them to appear in Person at the Time and Place pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fix'd by the Writ, and to warn the Chapter to send one of their Body, and the Clergy of the Diocese Two thither; and moreover to transmit an account to him of what they had done, or would do in this matter. To this the Deans, Priors, or Archdeacons, made answer by their <hi>Certificatorium</hi>; which recited the Bishop's Writ, as that recited the King's, and concluded al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways either that they had done, or would do, as commanded. Upon this the Chapter met and deputed One, and the Clergy of the Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cese Two to appear for them in Parliament. The Persons so deputed had <hi>Procuratoria</hi> (or Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Substitution,<note place="margin">Literae de Rato.</note> and Ratihabition) given to 'em from the Persons they represented: These ran always in the same Terms with the Writs of Summons, and varyed according to them; so that when the One was <hi>ad tractan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, ordinandum, &amp; faciendum</hi>; or <hi>ad faciendum &amp; consentiendum,</hi> or <hi>ad consentiendum</hi> only, so was the Other. These Instruments they exhibited the first day of the Session, or at least of their Appearance there; and <hi>Memorandum</hi>'s of them
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:48421:132"/>
were enter'd, together with the other Proxies, by the Clerk of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>This was the Method in which the <hi>Praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nientes</hi> was Executed upon the Inferior Clergy, and obey'd by them: a Method, not practis'd once, or twice, upon an Exigence only (as our Adversaries ignorantly talk); but for two hundred years and upwards, at least, after the first framing it.</p>
               <p>Several times it was inserted in the Latter Years of <hi>Edward</hi> the First, as the Writs Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Pryn,</hi> and <hi>Dugdale</hi> shew, and sometimes when they take no notice of it <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>For instance, the Writ for the Parliament</hi> in Quindena Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic. 33 <hi>E.</hi> 1. <hi>is Printed in</hi> Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale (<hi>p.</hi> 45.) <hi>without the</hi> Praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nientes: <hi>whereas both That, and the Writ of Prorogation certainly had it; as appears from a</hi> Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficatorium <hi>relating to the one, and a</hi> Procuratorium <hi>to the other; both enter'd in a Register of</hi> Henry <hi>the Prior of</hi> Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury.</note>. And I have seen either the <hi>Certificatories,</hi> or <hi>Letters of Proxy,</hi> that were drawn up by some Capitular Body or other, in relation to every one of these Meetings. Three or four of these for the Convent of <hi>Bathe, Pryn</hi>

               <p>All <hi>Edward</hi> the First's time, I have said, that this Clause had its due effect; the Clergy, by vertue of it, resorting from <hi>Both Provinces</hi> to Parliament. Of this the Evidence is very Full
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48421:132"/>
and Convincing, in relation to his Last Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Carlisle,</hi> the Records of which <hi>Ryley</hi> has Printed at length in his <hi>Placita Parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi>; and amongst them, the Names of all those <hi>Proctors</hi> that appear'd for every <hi>Capitular Body,</hi> and for the Clergy of Each Diocese of the Kingdom. 'Tis the only thing of the kind that is extant, or perhaps preserv'd; and the Book where it lyes is in the Hands of Few but the Professors of the Law: for which reason I shall place a <hi>Specimen</hi> of it in the <hi>Appendix</hi>

               <p>Nor did any Change happen in this respect, all <hi>Edward</hi> the Second's time: Indeed the Weakness of that Prince (who was given up to his Favourites and his Pleasures), and the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant which Archbishop <hi>Winchelsey</hi> had over him, after his Return from Exile, encourag'd, the Clergy to slacken a little in their Obedience to this Clause, at the Beginning of his Reign: and once or twice under Archbishop <hi>Reynolds</hi> they attempted to free themselves wholly from the Authority of a Lay-Summons. But they could not bring it to pass; and after a short struggle therefore soon return<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d to their Duty, and made their Representatives regularly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Tenor of it, throughout all the Latter part of his Reign. It will be at least a curious, if not an useful piece of knowledge, to give our selves some Account of the Steps taken by the Lower Clergy, to get rid of the <hi>Praemunientes,</hi> and of the little Varieties made use of in convening them, at this Critical Time.</p>
               <p>In the first and third years of this Prince, when it went out, it was comply'd with <note n="*" place="margin">Vide Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toria data 3. Apr. 1307. &amp; 25. Apr. 1309. in Registro <hi>Henrici Prioris.</hi>
                  </note>: but the Clergy afterwards fell off, so that in his
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48421:133"/>
fifth year, he found himself oblig'd to insert a Clause of a different nature into the two Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops Writs <note n="*" place="margin">

it would have brought the Clergy more effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually, and in fuller Numbers to Parliament than the Praemunitory Clause did.

               <p>The Alteration this produc'd was, that the next year [of this Prince's reign, but the same of our Lord] the Archbishop had two several Writs directed to him, when the Parliament was Summon'd; the One, as he was Bishop of the Diocese, with the Usual Clause for the Lower Clergy; the other <note n="‖" place="margin">

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, They who make this Supposition, make it mightily to the advantage of the Lower Clergy, and suppose their Presence in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to have been indispensably necessary. And thus stood the Clergies Obligations in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the <hi>Praemunientes,</hi> throughout <hi>Edward</hi> the Second's Reign.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="236" facs="tcp:48421:136"/>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> the Third continu'd this Practice upon the very same Foot that he found it: the only difference was, that whereas before his Time the <hi>Praemunientes</hi> was inserted, or left out, at the King's pleasure, in his Reign it grew a constant and necessary part of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's Writ; so that no <hi>Parliament</hi> ever met without one, after his sixth year; that is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, after the Compleat Settlement of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the Foot on which they do now, and will, I hope, for ever stand. And this Observation alone is sufficient to shew, that the Clause in the Bishops Writ was not grown Use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less; for if it had, it would not then have been most regularly inserted, and have grown most in request, when its Use and Significancy (if some Mens word were to be taken) had utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanish'd.</p>
               <p>In the year before it was fix'd, tho' there were several Summons to Parliament, yet it was inserted but in One of them, and in that One it was obey'd. For the Records of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment tell us, that upon a Debate, <hi>the Bishops and Proctors of the Clergy went by themselves</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Abr. of Rec. p. 11.</note>. And that These were Proctors of the <hi>Inferior Clergy,</hi> according to the strict sense of the word, and not the Proxies only of Absent Bishops, Abbats and Priors, (as <hi>L. M. P.</hi> dreams <note n="†" place="margin">P. 32.</note>) does from hence appear, that in the other Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this year, when the <hi>Praemunientes</hi> was not practis'd, no mention is made of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the Clergy; the Phrase then being, that <hi>the Bishops went by themselves, the Lords by themselves, and the Knights by themselves</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">P. 12.</note>. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there ever in those Records any menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Proctors of the Clergy</hi> at a <hi>Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,</hi>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:48421:136"/>
but at <hi>Parliaments</hi> only: the reason of which is, that Parliament-Writs only had the <hi>Praemunientes</hi> in them, but the Summons for Great Councils had not.</p>
               <p>And now therefore the Clergies Returns for the Parliament are frequently to be met with in our Old Registers, Parliaments themselves being frequent. If in the succeeding Reigns we find not so many of these <hi>Procuratoria</hi> on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, it is not to be wonder'd at: for the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop's Writ, which went out concurrently with the <hi>Praemunientes,</hi> being understood to be a Summons to Parliament (which it was in Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, tho' not in Terms) and being strictly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted upon the Inferior Clergy, might in time bring on a Disuse of the Forms practis'd in Executing the Other. The Bishops, through whose Hands both the Parliamentary and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Summons came, might sometimes, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the Neglect of their Officers <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>To this Neglect of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers that Clause seems to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which was an usual part of the King's Writ to the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop in</hi> E. 2. <hi>&amp;</hi> 3ds <hi>time,</hi> Nos no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentes negotia nostra pro defectu Praemunitionum antedictarum, si forsan minùs ritè factae fue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rint, aliqualiter retardari.</note>, or as thinking it sufficient, transmit the first of them only; or, if Both were transmitted, might wink at the Clergies Omission in making their Return but to the One: as not being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to sooth up the Lower Orders in their Averseness to comply with a Lay-Summons; because that sensibly encreas'd the Greatness and Power of the Parliament Prelates; and by degrees brought the Clergies Interest in State-matters all into their Hands. Besides oftentimes, when the Bishop executed the <hi>Praemunientes,</hi> and the Clergy certify'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, yet no notice might be taken in our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:48421:137"/>
of Forms which return'd so very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, and which were not stood much up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, while the Provincial Mandate, that went out on the same Occasion had its certain and Regular Course. These and several other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents might, I say, conspire to make the Entry of such <hi>Procuratoria</hi> in Chapter-Books less fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in after-times: however neither are they sow'd so thinly there, but that we can make a shift from the Helps of this kind that are left to continue the Succession of them down from the 22 <hi>E.</hi> 1. to the Latter End of <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh's Reign, as low as whose 19<hi>th.</hi> year <note n="*" place="margin">Anno 1503.</note> I have seen a Deputation <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> App. Num. XI.</note> made to a Monk, to represent a Capitular Body in Parliament; and that, drawn up in such a manner, as to be at once a Joint-Proxy both for the Parliament and Convocation. I question not, but that there are more of a Lower Date (tho' I have not had Opportunity, or Leisure to search for them) for I find that the <hi>Praemunientes</hi> was exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in form, as low as the 33<hi>d</hi> and 36<hi>th.</hi> years of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth <note n="‖" place="margin">

               <p>Not many years after this, the Custom of returning Proxies to Parliament in Form, did, I believe, cease: and if a Conjecture may be allow'd in a matter of this nature, where with some care and search one might be certain, I should choose to fix the Time of this Total Disuse, not far off of the 6<hi>th.</hi> or 7<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, when the Disputes between the Spiritualty and Temporalty about the Exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Clerks, growing loud and warm, and the Clergy with an high hand asserting their
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48421:137"/>
Priviledges, might take up thoughts of setting themselves free also in another Instance than that which they contended about, and agree generally to frame no more Instruments of Proxy in Obedience to the Lay-Summons. And this Guess of mine falls in well enough with the Tradition my Lord of <hi>Sarum</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as prevailing in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, <hi>that the Inferior Clergy departed from their Right of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the House of Commons, when they were all brought under a</hi> Praemunire <hi>in Cardinal</hi> Wolsey<hi>'s time</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Hist. Ref. Vol. 2. p. 48.</note>; if we understand this of the first <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire</hi> they fell into upon the Citation of <hi>Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish,</hi> and not (as his Lordship does) of that from which they ransom'd themselves by a Tax and a Submission, fourteen years afterwards; and if by <hi>departing from their Right of being in the House of Commons</hi> we do, as we must, suppose his Lordship to mean, that they declin'd send<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up those Deputations to Parliament, which manifested their Antient Right of sitting in it, and being part of it. For there could not pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be any <hi>Tradition</hi> in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time of the Inferior Clergy's sitting in the House of Commons, in the middle of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Reign, because there were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably many Persons then alive, who remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber'd the contrary, and there were certainly some who understood the Old Constitution of Parliaments well enough to contradict so ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surd an Opinion, and prevent its spreading: a very small degree of skill in our <hi>English</hi> Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities sufficing to have inform'd 'em that the Lower Clerks had <hi>no place in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,</hi> not only at the Period assign'd, but for an hundred years before it. The truth is, I am
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48421:138"/>
the worse satisfy'd with this Guess of mine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I do not find what Ground his Lordship had to say, that there was in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s time, such a Tradition. For he seems to have taken up this Opinion from the fourth Article of Bishop <hi>Ravis</hi>'s Paper <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See it</hi> Coll. <hi>of</hi> Rec. Vol. 2. p. 121.</note> which he there quotes: whereas I must take the Liberty to say, that his Lordship misunderstood that Article, if he thought it related to any thing done in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Reign. For the <hi>Separation</hi> there spoken of is plainly of antient Date, and refers (as there is good reason to think) to the Times of <hi>Edward</hi> the First, and Archbishop <hi>Winchelsey.</hi> But whatever was the precise time at which the Clergy desisted wholly to make their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to the Bishops Writ, it is certain they did not think, that upon that failure the Effect and Influence of the Praemunitory Clause ceas'd, but look'd upon themselves as still Summon'd by it, and meeting in vertue of it, in their Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Assemblies. Of this their Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strance in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, is a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn and Authentick Proof; the words of it have been produc'd already, Page 66. of these Papers, and thither I shall refer the Reader. If after this we hear of no Formal Claim made by the Church in this case, it was because there was no need of it; Common Opinion, and Common Practice being all along of her side; and no Instance to be given of a New Parliament Summon'd, without a Convocation to attend it, from the Times of the Reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, till some years after the late Revolution. And no wonder therefore that a Claim was not frequently put in, which was never till lately deny'd, or disputed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="241" facs="tcp:48421:138"/>Thus have I given the Reader some account of the <hi>Praemunientes,</hi> its Rise, and Use, and of the Methods which all along have been taken by the Bishops in Executing it, and by the Lower Clergy in obeying it. An imperfect Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count indeed! however such an one, as does, I am sure, sufficiently expose the Letter-wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters pretence <note n="†" place="margin">P. 32.</note>, that it was a Clause added on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>upon a Particular Occasion, and continu'd after the Business was determin'd, and has stood in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Writ these</hi> 300. <hi>years without any manner of Use.</hi> Assertions that, I might by this time be allow'd to tell him, could flow from nothing but the Depth of Ignorance or ill will to the Function, were I not restrain'd by considering whence <note n="*" place="margin">Hist. Ref. Vol. 2. p. 48.</note> it is that he borrows his Light, and Who therefore would be understood to share the Reflection.</p>
               <p>Indeed strange it is, that any Man in the least vers'd in our Antiquities should doubt, whether the Clergy came to Parliament by the <hi>Praemunientes</hi>; and stranger still that he should imagin that Clause to have been preserv'd in the Writ by Accident, after its first Insertion, and think to account for this merely by <hi>the neglect of a Clark</hi>

A neglect, that must have continu'd now for above four hundred years; and yet could not possibly have continu'd One, if it were a neglect, without being ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, and amended. No Forms were more nicely worded, or more Religiously kept to, in the main Frame and Substance of them, than Writs of Summons to Parliament.

All that One could have wish'd in the Case is, that where Light on these, and such other Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts as these was wanting, and Mistakes therefore were necessary, his Lordship had been so happy as to have mistaken always on the Side, and to the Advantage of the Clergy; which, some Readers will tell us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship has not always done. But let this be as it will — The Plea here advanc'd in behalf of that Eminent Historian cannot be made use of to excuse our <hi>Letter-Writer,</hi> who has no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Title to it. It was His Chief Business to have consider'd with care the Rise of the <hi>Praemunientes,</hi> and the Reasons of its continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, the Obligation it was all along under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood to lay on the Inferior Clergy, and their Methods of complying with it; this being one Great Article upon which the Dispute, that he was so willing to thrust himself into, turn'd. And his Ignorance therefore of every thing that relates to it is inexcusable; but his Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, under so Gross a degree of Ignorance
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:48421:140"/>
yet more inexcusable. For these are his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory Words — <hi>That the Clergy were ever a part of the Parliament, or sate in it, is very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain; the Affirmative being supported only by Conjectures, without any Record or Authentick Memorial to maintain it</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 31.</note>. Words, which no Learned Man could ever have said, and no Wise Man, conscious of his want of Skill in this point, would ever have ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur'd to say. But it seems neither of these Qualities hinder'd our <hi>Letter-writer</hi> from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into them, and by that means affording us a clearer Proof of his own utter Unfitness to meddle in this Argument, than he has given of any One Point besides that he pretends to maintain. For it is certain (as certain as that these Words were thrown out by this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at Random) that the Inferior Clergy were a part of the Parliament, were Summon'd, and repair'd to it as such, and as such sat in it, both when the <hi>Praemunientes</hi> first went out, and many years afterwards—<hi>sat</hi> in it, I say; not under the same Roof, indeed, with the Laity (I mean not Ordinarily); but asunder, as a separate State; and as the Lords now sit (and even then, for the Greater part of this Period, sat) asunder from the Commons. And he who makes this matter of <hi>Conjecture,</hi> and pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces it <hi>Uncertain,</hi> puts it beyond a Conjecture, how far in things of this kind, his word is to be taken. I have shewn him, that there are many Unquestionable <hi>Records,</hi> and <hi>Authentick Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials</hi> yet left (some Printed, but more in Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script) which prove the Clergy to have been once in the strictest sense of the word, a <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Parliament:</hi> and if the Church part of
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48421:141"/>
these Records lay out of his way (tho' they were as open to Him, I dare say, as they were to me) yet as a Lawyer, methinks, he should have had some Acquaintance with <hi>Ryley's Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cita Parliamentaria.</hi>

               <p>As for Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> he resolves to be as little out as he can on this Head, and therefore wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly says nothing of it. For from the Beginning to the End of his Book you shall not find a word to inform us, how the <hi>Praemunientes,</hi> after its first Insertion, was executed upon the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Clergy, and obey'd by them. He seems indeed to be of Opinion, that the Clergy were a Part of Parliament, in <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's Reigns; and he means, I suppose, that they were a Part of it, as Summon'd thither by the <hi>Praemunientes,</hi> tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 253.</note>. A very free piece of Advice indeed! which not only his Order, but the Great Council of the Realm have rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to thank him for! Who for some hundred years have been under the Mistake of thinking this Clause an Essential Part of the Writ, till their Eyes were open'd at last by this Wise Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>server! While our Constitution was unsetled, these Writs were so too; but they are now as Immovable as That. Let them have been Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Grace, or Badges of Duty at first, they have since grown to be Charters of Right and
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:48421:141"/>
Priviledge by long Use and Continuance. The <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> indeed may alter them, if they please, (for they may do any thing); but I humbly suppose that no One Part of the Constitution can do it without the Other. Some of our Princes indeed have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to make some slight Changes in them; but scarce sooner entred on the Attempt, than they disclaim'd it. Had Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> known in the least, how Sacred those Forms are held by our Law, and of how great Importance it is to the Constitution to preserve them, he would never have <hi>dar'd</hi> to recommend such an Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration as this; but Ignorance is fearless! We may see here, how the Love of <hi>Alterations</hi> creeps upon a Man, and how far in time it may carry him; from mending the Model of the Church (which was the work Ten years ago) to the Improving that of the State: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out considering, that the One of these may be tamper'd with, and practis'd upon more easily than the other, and more securely. When such Bold Proposals as these come from Private Unauthoriz'd Hands, they deserve a Publick Censure; and, (because I am for every thing's having what it deserves) I hope, will find it.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> it seems, does not understand to what purpose this Clause is retain'd in the Writ, and proposes therefore a Retrenchment of it. An hard Case this, that the Writ should be alter'd, because he does not understand it! for at this rate, what Old Forms are secure? I have endeavour'd however to help his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing a little, and to shew him, that it is retain'd there to very good Purpose; that it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares the <hi>King's</hi> Right of Summoning the
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48421:142"/>
Clergy to attend his Parliaments in Body, the <hi>Lords and Commons</hi> Right of being thus at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and the <hi>Clergy</hi>'s Right also to be Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd, and to attend accordingly. And that These are very great and weighty reasons for keeping it there, appears from what has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned already, and may happen hereafter. The Time is now come when the Clergy find themselves oblig'd to put in their Claim to a <hi>Parliamentary</hi> Attendance, because it is dispu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: and according to the Natural Vicissitudes of things, a Time may possibly come, when the <hi>Crown,</hi> or the <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> shall want the Parliamentary Attendance of the Clergy, and be willing to claim it. Equal Provision is made against each of these Inconveniences, by continuing the <hi>Praemunitory Clause</hi> in the Bishops Summons: where, I hope, it will ever conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> even tho' a Sett of Future Bishops should arise (which God forbid) that would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to be Summon'd without it; as not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering, that it is as much Their Interest, as the Inferior Clergy's, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Were this Alteration at any time to take place, it had been well for Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> that it had hapned, before he wrote his Book; for then, had the Clause been left out of the Writ, he might have left it out of his <hi>Appendix</hi> too, and by that means sav'd himself the shame of those Childish Mistakes which he has com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in Reciting it; and which shall in due Time and Place be made known <note n="*" place="margin">

What a wonderful way of arguing is this? how can we choose but surrender upon such Proofs, as soon as they are produc'd?

                  </gap>'d that it is not even at this time so insignificant a Form, as we are made to believe; much more, that it has not been so now for some Hundreds of years. But there is also another Summons of the Clergy; tho' not <hi>to Parliament,</hi> yet to meet in <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-time,</hi> under the Two Archbishops, in their several Provinces. And This too has been regularly issu'd out, as often as a New Parliament was call'd from the Latter End of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second till now, with Few Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions to the contrary; and with None, from the first Dawn of the Reformation in <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth's Reign, down to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent. And from this Antient Custom (as An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient as the Compleat Settlement of our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution) the Clergy think themselves intitled to be Summon'd, to assemble, and to sit <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincially,</hi> when ever a New Parliament meets.</p>
               <p>But here it is objected, that the King's Writ to the Two Archbishops to call the Clergy of their Provinces together <hi>has no relation to the calling of a Parliament, nor does so much as mention it</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">L. M.

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:48421:143"/>
meets; for that is plainly a Distinct Assembly, and Summon'd by a Distinct Writ</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 32.</note>. And much to the same purpose Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> p. 226. (284.) and elsewhere, has stated the matter. I think this needs no Answer, but what it has already re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. For allowing the Objection in its full force, yet since <hi>Custom is the Law of Parliaments,</hi> and it has perpetually been the Custom to issue out these Writs to the Archbishops, whenever Writs went out for the Parliament; it is certain that the Clergy have a Right to these Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Assemblies in Parliament time, on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Antient Prescription, tho' the Convocation-Writ it self should neither men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Parliament, or any ways refer to it. For if a Custom of three or four hundred years standing, will not create a Right, I know not what will. However, that I may not seem to neglect any thing that has the Look of an Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, I will give a further and more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct Answer to it; going on (as I propos'd) in the</p>
               <p n="2">2<hi>d</hi> Place to shew, that the Writs to the Two Archbishops to convene the Clergy of their Provinces, tho' they do not expresly <hi>mention</hi> a Parliament, yet have an Immediate <hi>Reference</hi> to it; the Original Design of their Issuing out together with the Bishops Writ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only to secure an Obedience to the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitory Clause, and to make the Clergy's Parliamentary Assemblies more Full and Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. This is so Indubitably true, and so capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being made out clearly from the Elder Convocation-Writs yet remaining, that had Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> or the Letter-Writer seen any one of them they would have foreborn starting
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:48421:144"/>
this Objection, for very fear of receiving the true Answer to it; than which nothing can more expose the Weakness of that Cause they plead for, or of the Arguments they bring to maintain it. The Case was truly thus—</p>

When it went out there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the 33 <hi>Edw.</hi> 1. Archbishop <hi>Winchelsey</hi> took this way of salving in some measure the pretended Priviledges of the Clergy, without disobeying it <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend. Numb. XIV (<hi>c</hi>).</note>. In his Letter to the Prior and Chapter of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> he recites not the whole Summons sent him by the King, but the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance only of the <hi>Warning Clause,</hi> and then commands them (as he did I suppose the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of his Diocese by the Archdeacon, and all the rest of his Province by the Dean of it, the Bishop of <hi>London</hi>) to appear before himself at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> a Day or two earlier than the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to meet, in order <hi>to treat with Him,</hi> (as a Provincial Council) <hi>and to do afterwards in Parliament what the Holy Canons of the Church should allow of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A weak Government succeeding, the Rigor of this Clause was so far relax'd, that tho' the King still kept it in his Writs, yet was he forc'd (as I have observ'd) to call the Archbishop to his help, in order to get it obey'd; and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the Clergy so far as to let the <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial</hi> go out hand in hand with the Parliamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Summons; accepting their Obedience to the One, as a Constructive Obedience to the

                  </note>. With this, or the <hi>Like</hi> Clause, I say; for from the End of <hi>E.</hi> 2. downwards, it ran nearly in these Terms: <hi>Et licet Injunxerimus singulis Episcopis praedictis qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Hitherto therefore the Writs for a Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion went not out only together with those for a Parliament, but were design'd purely to Second and Inforce them, and to be a Double Tye upon the Clergy to come to Parliament, being call'd thither both by the Bishops Writ, and by a Provincial Citation from their Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan. And the same Members therefore, we may observe, neither more nor fewer, are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd to be resummon'd by the Provincial Writ, which had been before Summon'd by the Premonishing Clause; Deans, Cathedral-Priors, Archdeacons, and the Clergy of Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Dioceses, being the only Persons ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both by the One and the Other, without any mention of Bishops, Abbats, or other Priors, who had Personal Summons to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and there being not so much danger therefore of Their not attending, the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>shop had no Commands in Relation to them. Accordingly his Mandate was usually drawn just as this Form directed, citing those of the Clergy, and no other than those which it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48421:145"/>
and exactly to the Time and Place prescrib'd. I shall present the Reader with a Copy of this Mandate, among the other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, as it was practis'd <hi>Anno</hi> 1321, to execute the Writ of the 14 <hi>E.</hi> 3. just now mention'd, and in it he will find also Expressions which shew,<note place="margin">Append. Numb. XIV (<hi>f.</hi>)</note> that the same Course had for a good while before this obtain'd.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, when the Archbishop Summon'd in Obedience to this Second Writ, he did not do always just what that Writ exacted, and no more; but took occasion <note n="†" place="margin">

Henr. Prioris. f. 234.</note> sometimes from thence to cite all those Abbots and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors who had no place in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, in order to compleat the Numbers of the Clergy, and form a <hi>Provincial Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly.</hi> And he cited 'em to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear (after <hi>Winchelsey</hi>'s Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern) not before the King, and among the other States; but before Himself, in the Chief Church of the Place. But this was at his Choice; for the King's Writ directed him only to command the Attendance of the Parliament-Clergy. And with this the Crown had reason to be content, while the Defects of these General Summons by the Provincial and Bishops Writs were supply'd by Particular Writs directed to great Numbers of Abbats and Priors, as the way was in <hi>Edward</hi> the First's and Second's time; the former of these citing Personally to his Parliaments, after the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munientes</hi> went out, often sixty, or seventy, and
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48421:146"/>
sometimes above eighty Regular Prelates; and the Latter usually Summoning about fifty of them, till the Declining Part of his Reign. But this being esteem'd an Hardship on those Regulars, who were not by <hi>Tenure</hi> oblig'd to attend the King's Summons (as holding no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of him by Barony), they were in time omitted, and the Number of Abbats and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, who had Personal Writs, reduc'd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout thirty; the Archbishop's General Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date then calling the rest to his Parliamentary Convocations, and that being allow'd and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by the Crown as a sufficient Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance in Parliament. But what the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop did of himself at first, That he did after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards at the King's Instance; who took occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion from this Practice to enlarge his own Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Direction to him, and by them at last to require him to Summon all those Regular Prelates he was us'd to Summon without such a Direction. This, as it was a Natural Step, so indeed it was necessary, after the Crown had foreclos'd it self from Summoning the greatest part of the Abbats Personally to Parliament: for then it lay purely in the Archbishop's Breast, whether he would call the Unsummon'd Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats by his General Mandate or no; and so, upon any Dispute between the Spirituality and Temporalty, the Crown might have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated of their Parliamentary Attendance.</p>
               <p>At what Time precisely these Writs to the Archbishop for a <hi>Full Convocation</hi> to be held concurrently with a Parliament, began to be practis'd, I have not found. The Eldest that has yet come to my hands is of the 10<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. when the Parliament was call'd to meet at
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:48421:146"/>
                  <hi>Nottingham die Lunae prox. post Festum S. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaei</hi>

                     <hi>See</hi> Dug. p. 186.</note> by a Writ dated <hi>Aug.</hi> 24. And the same day another Writ issu'd to the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to call all the Clergy of his Province to <hi>Leicester, ad diem Lunae prox. post Festum S. Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaelis,</hi> that is seven days afterwards <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Cl. 10 <hi>E.</hi> 3. m. 16. dors.</note>. And the next year again the same thing was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd; the Archbishop being order'd to Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon the Convocation to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, two or three days after the Parliament was to meet at <hi>Westminster</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Pryn. <hi>Parl. Wr.</hi> Vol. 1. p. 39, 40.</note>. And still (which is observable) the Style of Authority in these Fuller Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation-Writs was the same as it was in those where the Premonish'd Clergy only were men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd; it being a Mixture of a Command and a Request [<hi>Rogando Mandamus</hi>] as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues to be in all Writs for a Convocation to this very Day.</p>
               <p>This also deserves notice in many of them, that they went not out only at the same time with the Parliament Writs, but mention the holding of a Parliament in their Preambles as the Ground of their issuing; that so the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, according to their Duty, might resort to it. Thus it was in the Writ of the 11 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <note n="*" place="margin">Ps. 2. m<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 40. dors.</note> just now mention'd.

               <p>These Writs for a <hi>Full Convocation</hi> grew now the Common Form, it being matter of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Practice to send them out concurrently with those for a Parliament, in <hi>Edward</hi> the Third, and <hi>Richard</hi> the Second's Reigns; and still the Convocation was (as in the preceding Instances) generally order'd to attend a few days sooner or later than the Parliament did,

and not precisely on the Spot, where the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament open'd, but at some Church, or Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-house near it.

               <p>Upon the whole therefore it is manifest, that the King's Writ for a Convocation, when it went out with that for the Parliament was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally only a Second Summons of the same

                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 29.</note>, because, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sooth, it does not now mention it expresly (tho' at first, for many years after it was practis'd, it did): and that Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> is yet further from Truth, when, in his Fantastick way of Speech, he tells us, that the Convocation call'd by the Provincial Writ <hi>is consisted of another sort of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. (284.)</note> than the Parliamentary Assemblies Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd by the <hi>Praemunientes</hi> were; since it is

certain, that Both those Assemblies were ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally <hi>consisted</hi> of the very same Persons, and were really but one Assembly of Men, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under a Double Capacity; and as certain also that they have been again thus <hi>consisted,</hi> for the last one hundred and sixty years. I am really at a Loss to determine, which of the Two is more absurdly false, the Doctrine he here lays down, or his manner of expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it.</p>
               <p>That Air of Assurance which Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> takes up every where on this Article would be very Amazing to a Man that did not consider, how Doubts dwell usually in knowing Breasts, and that those who have the least skill in things are most apt to be Positive.
<q>It is as plain (says he) as any thing can well be, That the Convocation of the Clergy consider'd as call'd by the Parliamentary Writs, and sitting by vertue of them; and the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation consider'd as Summon'd by the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation-Writ, and the Order of the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop consequent thereupon, are, in their <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Constitution</hi> two different Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; and which, by no means, ought to be confounded together <note n="*" place="margin">P. 226.</note>.</q>
                  <hi>By no means</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, if Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s Cause must right or wrong be upheld: for the confounding these two As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, and making them but one, confounds all his Little Aims and Reasonings. However, I have shewn, that they must necessarily be, and have always been thus <hi>confounded together,</hi> when ever the <hi>Praemunientes,</hi> and a Royal Writ for the Convocation went out joyntly; and it will puzzle Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> I believe, out of his Plentiful store of Useless Collections to furnish
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:48421:149"/>
us with a single Proof to the contrary, where the Convocation-Clergy call'd by the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop at the King's Writ, and those Summon'd by the <hi>Praemunientes,</hi> have met, sat, and acted in the same Province distinctly; all which they must have done, to be, what he tells us they were, <hi>two different Assemblies.</hi> Nothing but a continu'd <hi>Series</hi> of such Instances as these, carry'd through the several Reigns in which this Double Summons was practis'd can justifie Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s Notion; and therefore I am very sure, it can never be justify'd: for They that that are vers'd in these things know, that when these two Summons issu'd concurrently from the King, the Clergy call'd up by the <hi>Praemu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nientes</hi> form'd no distinct Assembly, but after making their Returns to it, sat and acted <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincially</hi>; and this, as I have often times said, was reputed, and accepted as a <hi>Parliamentary Attendance.</hi> At these Times therefore the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the Clergy <hi>praemonish'd</hi> by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Writ, had, as Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> says rightly, <hi>no Existence,</hi> i. e. <hi>no separate Existence</hi> from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation of the two Provinces; but was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in it, and represented by it, and acted through it. 'Tis true, Two sort of Writs go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out to call the Clergy in Time of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there is room for a Nice Head to distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish (as Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> does) between the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Constitution</hi> of that Assembly which relates to the One, and the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Constitution</hi> of that As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly which relates to the Other. But these two Assemblies being in fact but one Assembly, it does us no Harm, as to the Argument we are upon, to consider that One Assembly under as many different Views and Respects as Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:48421:149"/>
So he will allow it to have but <hi>One Exist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence</hi> (to keep to his Phrase) we will not dispute its having Two <hi>Essences</hi>; that is, its convening under two different <hi>Formalities:</hi> for Metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sical Speculations ought to make no Quarrels among Friends.</p>

               <p>I Have in the Preceding Chapter examin'd carefully into the Rise, Nature, and Force of the <hi>Praemunientes,</hi> and of the <hi>Convocation-Writ</hi> that goes out with it; and have fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd whatever may be objected from either of these against the Clergy's right of Meeting and Sitting in Convocation together with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry New Parliament: more fully indeed than the Objection it self deserves, had I intended barely to pull down what was advanc'd on the other side, without giving some further Light into this Intricate, and as yet untrodden Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. For the Objection it self might in Two Words have been dispatched by saying, That the Clergy have certainly a <hi>Right of Meeting and Sitting in Convocation thus often, because thus often they have for some hundred years met and sat:</hi> And this is a plain short Answer, which is capable of no Evasion. Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> however has made some small Effort towards Eluding it; and what he offers to this purpose shall in the next place be consider'd.</p>
               <p>We find him (<hi>Pp.</hi> 106, 107, 140, 141, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) thus distinguishing: That the Clergy have no Right to <hi>Meet,</hi> and <hi>Sit,</hi> but only to be <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd</hi> as often as a Parliament: That having
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:48421:150"/>
indeed for <hi>some hundreds of years</hi> been Summon'd always with the Parliament, <hi>it may be question'd</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 229.</note> 
                  <hi>whether they have not</hi> (he means, <hi>it is not to be question'd but that they have</hi>) now a Right to such a concurrent Summons; but it is certain <hi>they have a Right to nothing besides; and it were no Great Matter whether They had a Right to that or no</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 107.</note>. This is Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s New Scheme for lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aside the Clergy's <hi>Parliamentary Meetings</hi> first, and their <hi>Parliamentary Summons</hi> afterwards. A very Honest Design, if it could be effected! and very fit to be first recommended to the world by the Pen of a Clergy-man! God be thanked his Abilities are not Equal to his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will in the Case, nor the Colours by him put upon this matter such, as will ever tempt a wise Ministry to execute what he has Proje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted! In answer to this New Distinction, I desire to be satisfy'd, why, if Custom gives the Convocation a Right to be <hi>Summon'd</hi> as often as the Parliament meets and sits, it does not give 'em a Right to <hi>Meet</hi> and <hi>Sit</hi> too; since it is certain that they have the very same <hi>Custom</hi> to plead for the One, as for the Other. Time out of mind the <hi>Custom</hi> has been, that when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Parliament has met, the Convocation (should not only be Summon'd, but) meet too; and accordingly for some Ages now it has met with it, and been open'd in Form by the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop, or in the Vacancy of his See, by some Bishop Commission'd from the Dean and Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Canterbury</hi>; Divine Service has been said, a Sermon preach'd, and a Prolocutor chosen. There are Instances indeed when they have gone no further than this, and done no other Business; but it was when they had no other
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:48421:150"/>
Business to do: for they were always put into a Posture of doing it, and into a Capacity of making such Motions and Requests as they should judge proper for the Good of the Church, or the Redress of Grievances. Till late years, it was <hi>never</hi> known, that Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations should <hi>meet</hi> purely in order to be <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ'd</hi>; that the Members of the Lower house should attend only to be told when they should attend next; without being allow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d to offer their Advices, or Complaints, or even to put themselves into a Condition of offering them. This Custom, we know is but nine years old, whereas the contrary Custom is as old as these Assemblies themselves are: and if <hi>Custom</hi> be the <hi>Law of Convocations</hi> (as Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> allows <note n="*" place="margin">P. 298.105.</note> it to be) he will be pleas'd to tell us, how this Establish'd Custom can be broke in upon, and set aside, without a Breach of the Law; and whether the Clergy's not being suffer'd to meet and form themselves into a Body, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Intent of their Summons be not (upon Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s Principles) as plain a Viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Rights, as it would be, not to Summon them Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> one would think, was under these Apprehensions; for she suffer'd a Popish Convocation to sit and act to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with her first Parliament, at a Time when she was taking all manner of Legal Steps and Means to expel Popery, and to introduce the Reformation: which she would never, I presume, have done, had she thought her Power extended so far over the Convocation as to adjourn them before a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locutor was chosen <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>There was indeed a Singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity practis'd at the En<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>ance of this Convocation, which I remember no In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of in any other: It was open'd without any</hi> Sermon. <hi>The reason of which is thus given in the Acts,</hi> Sess. 2. Episcopus <hi>London</hi> Commissarius —evocatâ Domo Inferiori exposuit eis Causam Convocationis, &amp; quod non futura sit concio <hi>pro more</hi> quia Sedes Episcopalis destituta ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istit, &amp; quia Consiliarii Regis [<hi>it should be</hi> Reginae] in mandatis dede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt, ne Conciones in Eâdem Ecclesiâ fierent, donec de Beneplacito Reginae constaret. <hi>The first of these Reasons is no reason, but the last is suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, according to the Doctrine of Those Times; when our Princes in Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their</hi> Supremacy, <hi>were thought to have a Power of silencing</hi> any, <hi>or even</hi> all <hi>the Pulpits of</hi> England <hi>at once; which both King</hi> Edward <hi>and Queen</hi> Mary <hi>are said to have practis'd. But that Doctrine being now out of Doors, the Practise founded upon it can be no Warrantable Precedent for our Times. Even the Acts themselves that give us an account of this</hi> Omission, <hi>affirm the</hi> Custom, <hi>and say the Sermon was a thing</hi> de more.</note>. And if she did not
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:48421:151"/>
think she had such a Power, it would make one apt to believe that she had it not: for, whatever else has been said of her, I never heard it laid to her Charge, that she was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the Extent of her Prerogative, or us'd it too tenderly.</p>
               <p>'Tis true, my Lord of <hi>Sarum</hi> informs us, that <hi>left the Clergy might set out Orders in Opposition to what the Queen was about to do, she sent and requir'd them under the Pains of a</hi> Praemunire <hi>to make no Canons</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Vol. 2. p. 327.</note>. His Lordship gives us no Authority for this Particular, and I must beg leave there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to suspect the Exactness of it; because the Submission-Act, and that which confirm'd it, were repeal'd in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s time, and as yet unreviv'd: and the Queen could have no Pretence from any other Acts than these to threaten them with a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> if they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to make Canons. However allowing this account of the Queen's Message to be just, we may observe, that tho' she prohibited 'em <hi>to make Canons,</hi> yet she did not forbid them to Sit and Act in Inferior Instances, because she thought it their Priviledge so to do; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:48421:151"/>
this very Convocation did business, drawing up their Judgment upon five Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Points in five Articles, by way of <hi>Protest,</hi> to be deliver'd (not to the Queen, as his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship thinks <note n="*" place="margin">Ibid.</note>) but to the Keeper of the Great Seal, and to the Lords of Parliament: And this they did, <hi>for the Disburthening of their Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerationem conscienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum sua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi>
                  </note>, as the Acts speak; and were allow'd to do it without Check or Disturbance. And if the Priviledges of a Popish Convocation were thus tenderly preserv'd to them by a Queen averse to their Principles, we may be sure that the Protestant Clergy afterwards had not less Liberty, or Worse Usage; but were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd freely to sit and declare their Grievances, as often as they were understood earnestly to desire it in the Succeeding Reigns: there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Instance of such a Liberty deny'd by any of our Princes to any of their Synods, when the Prince and the Synod were of the same Judgment in Religion. I have shewn that it has been granted even when they dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd in Principles, let Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> prove to us, that ever it was with-held when they agreed; and he will somewhat lessen the Opinion the Clergy have of the Hardship they at present lye under.</p>
               <p>If <hi>Custom</hi> therefore creates a <hi>Right,</hi> we are sure that the Clergy have a Right to somewhat more than a Bare <hi>Summons</hi>; they have a Right actually to assemble, to be form'd into a Body, and to fill the Chair of the Lower House; and if they have any Petitions or Motions to make in Church-matters, they have a right to sit so long as till they have made them; for thus they have been always <hi>accustom'd</hi> to do; and
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48421:152"/>
when they were adjourn'd without it, it was upon a Presumption, that they had nothing of this kind to offer, and were themselves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to such Adjournments.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> himself is forc'd in good measure to agree to this, for he owns, that <hi>whilst the Clergy were wont to assess themselves, and their sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon this account was necessary for the support of the Government; they were not only Summon'd to meet, but were wont actually to assemble; and sit so long as it was requisite for them to do for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 141, 249.</note>. Now 'tis not forty years ago since the Clergy were in the undisputed Possession of this Priviledge of Assessing themselves; and till That time therefore, even by Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession, they had Custom, and consequently Right of their side, even for Assembling, and Sitting, as well as being Summon'd. And the Late Discontinuance of this Custom cannot yet have infring'd that Right, as being not yet Immemorial. There is no Custom therefore for the Methods lately taken; and it is the Clergy's great desire that there never may be any: and for that reason among others it is that a Convocation is so earnestly call'd for, to prevent this Pretence of Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s from grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up into an Argument; for tho' it have now no manner of strength in it, yet twenty or thirty years hence perhaps it may.</p>
               <p>But tho' Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> is out, as to the Clergy's having no <hi>Right,</hi> because no <hi>Custom</hi> to sit; yet at least he can prove, he thinks, that 'tis very <hi>fit and reasonable</hi> they <hi>should</hi> have none, upon Two Accounts: the One, drawn from the <hi>True End and Design of calling the Clergy to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>; the Other, from the <hi>Alteration that has
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:48421:152"/>
hapned in the Original Constitution of those Meetings.</hi> As to the First of these, he tells us, that the True End and Design of the Clergy's Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling with the Parliament was <hi>to raise Money</hi>; and that End therefore now ceasing, since they have left off to assess themselves, the Right grounded upon it ought to cease too <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <p>
                        <hi>All the use that was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally made of them was to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concur with the other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>states in granting Money to the King, which having done, they were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly dismissed without entring on any other Business.</hi> Pp. 106, 107.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>However the King usually added a Conciliary Summons to his Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Writ—yet still the Design was in Both the same that they might thereby more effectually confirm what had in Parliament been granted to the King,</hi> &amp;c. Ibid.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The Main Design our Princes seem to have had in assembling these Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations either at the same time they did their Parliament, or not long after, was to get Money from them.</hi> P. 227.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>This was the Great Use the King was wont to make of our Convocations, and from thence it came to be the Custom to Summon them for the most part as often as the Parliament met.</hi> P. 229.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For the most part what was done by the Convocation when they met, was only to confirm or make an order for Money.</hi> P. 228.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>For the most part the Great End our Kings had in Summoning them was to get Money from them.</hi> P. 245.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>As long as the Clergy in Convocation have continu'd to assist the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by granting Subsidies, it has been allow'd to sit as often as it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to that purpose, tho' it has seldom done any thing besides.</hi> P. 250.</p>
                  </note>. As to the Second, That the Convocation, when it us'd to sit at the same Time with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was a <hi>Member of Parliament</hi>; but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so now, there is no reason why it should sit with it <note n="†" place="margin">Pp. 105, 106, 107.</note>.</p>
               <p>The first of these is so False and Scandalous a Reflection upon our Princes, and those Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and upon the Constitution it self, that I wonder how it could drop from the Pen of an <hi>English Divine,</hi> that had any Regard left for his Church, or his Country; and how even This
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:48421:153"/>
Writer, as meanly as he may think of Synods, and their Powers, could yet prevail with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to say it. He says it, not once or twice only, but often, and with the utmost Assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; of Convocations call'd <hi>out of</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment time, as well as of those which met <hi>in</hi> it; and seems to be afraid only, lest this Decent Maxim should escape the Reader's Eye; and has therefore taken care to instill it so often, and on so different Occasions, that one can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not read long in his Book without meeting it. Let us see, how he attempts the Proof of it.</p>
               <p>Why, he tells us, that in the accounts of our Elder Synods, little more is said to have been done by them, than that they gave the King such and such Supplies; and <hi>tho' they met often in former times, yet as for Ecclesiastical Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, for ought he can find, they did as little with their often meeting then, as they do with their sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom meeting now</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 283.</note>. But first, allowing all this to be true, does it follow from hence that the <hi>End</hi> of the Convocations sitting was to give Money? might not frequent Opportunities be taken of pressing the Clergy to Grants, and yet That not be the <hi>End</hi> of their Meeting? Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney has been as frequently given by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as by Convocations, and has been as much the Design of calling them; so that once upon a Time <note n="†" place="margin">Cl.

that That Parliament was not call'd in order to a Supply, it is taken notice of by our Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as a Wonder: Nevertheless the <hi>Reason</hi> and <hi>End</hi> of those State-meetings is not, I suppose, to be fetch'd purely from Money, but <hi>Redress of Grievances,</hi> according to the honest Doctrine of the <hi>Mirror</hi>

Further, had the accounts we have left of Convocations mention'd lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle more than the Supplies they gave, yet it might have become Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> to suspect that those accounts were De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective, and that much besides might have been done, tho' little else was recorded. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion that the Clergy bore in the Taxes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a matter in which the State, as well as the Church was nearly concern'd, might be set down in our Annals with a more than Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Care; on the Crown-side it might be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of, that the King for the future might be sure of <hi>as much</hi>; on the Clergy's side, that they might be sure of giving <hi>no more</hi>: Both might think it prudent to arm themselves with Precedents for a Demand, or a Denyal, as the Case might happen; and for this reason, among others, the Article of <hi>Subsidies</hi> might have been suppos'd to make so considerable a Figure in the Story of those Synods, had Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> been inclin'd in the least to embrace any accounts that were for the Honour or Interest of his Order. But after all, the very Bottom he goes upon is false; an injurious, and ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less Misrepresentation: For that the Clergy, when met, had a great deal of other Business to do, besides Raising Money, appears from
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:48421:154"/>
Numerous and Undeniable Testimonies. And if Dr. <hi>Wake cannot find 'em,</hi> as he says, 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he has not <hi>look'd</hi> where they ought to be <hi>found,</hi> or at least not with that care he ought to do, in order to find them. Had he look'd into <hi>Spelman</hi> or <hi>Lynwood,</hi> methinks, he might have found, that they made Provincial <hi>Canons</hi> and <hi>Constitutions</hi> all along for the good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church; and by means of 'em repress'd now and then an Aspiring Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that was making a False Court by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traying the Interests of his Body, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to build his Fortune upon the Ruin of their Liberties. Had he lookt into our <hi>Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> as nicely as he would be thought to have done, particularly into <hi>Harpsfield,</hi> and <hi>Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates Britannicae,</hi> he would have found, that they were taken up often in Foreign, and more often in Domestick Affairs of the utmost Importance; in Deputing some of their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to General Councils <note n="*" place="margin">Harpsf. p. 610, 611.</note>, and preparing their Instructions; in restoring Peace to the Church, when it was broken by the clashing of Popes with Councils <note n="†" place="margin">Ant.

But above all, had he look'd into the few Old Acts and Journals of Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation sav'd out of the General Wreck, and
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48421:154"/>
yet remainining, he would have found, that the <hi>Articuli Reformandi,</hi> or <hi>Gravamina Cleri</hi> were put up almost at every Session, that Subsidies were seldom given without them, and that they were suggested often, when no Subsidies were given; the Clergy in those Days being allow'd sometimes to approach their Prince Empty-handed, and to beg of him what was their Due without paying for the Liberty of doing it. Reforming Grievances was so much the End of the Clergy's Conciliary Meetings, that the Archbishop mention'd it oftentimes in his very Provincial Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date <note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:48421:155"/>
has given of his knowing no other sense of the word <hi>Synodus,</hi> but that of a <hi>Church-Assembly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many other ways the Clergy assembled in Synod had of employing themselves to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of the Church and the Commonwealth; too many to be Enumerated, and too well understood to be insisted on: if Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> knows nothing of these things, he is to be pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tied for his Ignorance; if he does, and yet dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembles his knowledg of them, he is to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested for a much worse Quality. But can this Gentleman be in Earnest when he says, that the Convocation had little else at any time to do but <hi>to give Money</hi>? does not He himself own in several places <note n="*" place="margin">Pp. 286, 287, 236, 237.</note>, that the King frequently sent his <hi>Prohibitions</hi> thither, commanding 'em not to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or proceed upon Business that he did not approve of? This implies, I think, that they were often otherwise employ'd than in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-matters: for Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> I believe, will not pretend that it was Usual with our Princes to <hi>prohibit</hi> the Clergy from giving them Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Nay, he tells us further out of <hi>Coke,</hi> that <hi>the King did often appoint Commissioners by Writ to sit with the Clergy in Convocation, and to have Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nusance of such things as they meant to establish, that nothing might be done in prejudice of their Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. [111.]</note>. And if so, he could not but see, that they were us'd to do some other Business beside Tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves; for here again I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that neither were these <hi>Commissioners</hi> sent to restrain the Clergy's Liberality. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the Reader yet further, that the Clergy, when met, <hi>had</hi> other things beside Taxes to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider of, I shall direct him to those very Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces brought by Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> to shew they <hi>had not:</hi>
                  <pb n="276" facs="tcp:48421:156"/>
I shall examin All his Proofs of this kind drawn from the Practice of <hi>Modern</hi> Synods, and by Them shall leave the Reader to judge how fairly he has dealt with the <hi>Antient</hi> ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>That I may not be thought (says he <note n="*" place="margin">P. 142.</note>) to speak <hi>at all Adventures,</hi> I will offer an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance or two of it. The Convocation that met the first of King <hi>Iames</hi> the First, was by Prorogation continu'd from time to time for seven years together. Yet except it were in his first year, we do not hear of any great Business that was done by them more than that of granting Subsidies.</q>
But I am well satisfy'd that he <hi>speaks at all adventures</hi> from this very Instance. For <note n="*" place="margin">Book X. p. 28.</note> 
                  <hi>Fuller</hi> seems to say, that the Acts of this Convocation were lost even in his time; and if so, Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> must needs be a Bold Adventurer, to pretend to say what was, or was not done in it. Besides, had he spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out, and told us plainly, what that Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness was they did in their first year, it would have given us some account why they might possibly have layn still a good while after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. For that Business was no less than the setling the whole Discipline of the Church in a Body of an hundred and forty one Canons then drawn up, which was one of the Greatest Works that ever any <hi>English</hi> Convocation had before them: and having finish'd it therefore, it would have been no wonder, if they had discontinu'd their Debates for some time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out entring on any thing that was Material. If they had no Business to do, we cannot expect that they should have made Business on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to do it. But after all it so happens that we can certainly prove this Convocation to have
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48421:156"/>
sat and done Business, and that of a very Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Nature: for in 1606 Bishop <hi>Overall</hi>'s Convocation-Book pass'd it; a Work, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable in it self; but made yet more consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able by the Event that attended the Publicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of it. And throughout all the rest of the Time, that they were Employ'd, or at least sitting, and in a Readiness to do Business, as it should happen, appears from the Bishop of St. <hi>David</hi>'s Speech in 1604, about the Use of the Cross <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>There is mention of this Speech in the Preface to</hi> Pool<hi>'s Sermon about Spiritual Worship. He speaks of it as made in</hi> 1604; <hi>tho' o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise I should have plac'd it at the Time when the Canons were passing.

So that no Instance could be more unfortunately pitch'd upon by Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> than this: Let us see whether he is more lucky in that which follows.</p>
               <p>His next Words are,
<q>In King <hi>Charles</hi> the First's time there were but Few Parliaments, and therefore we are not to look for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations in that, <note n="†" place="margin">P 142.</note>.</q>
In the first sixteen
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:48421:157"/>
years of King <hi>Charles</hi> the First there were five New Parliaments chosen, and as many Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations; and every One of those Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons met, and sat, and we know who were the Prolocutors in each of them. The first of these five <note n="*" place="margin">Anno 1625. <hi>See</hi> Fuller. C. H. Book. XI. p. 108.</note> was hindred from doing much Business by the Plague which then reign'd; and the Last, by a <hi>Select Committee</hi> for Alterations, which sat in the <hi>Ierusalem-Chamber</hi> of the Deanery of <hi>Westminster,</hi> and was set on foot to supplant the Use of Synods. And yet even in these Two, Motions were made <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Some Instances of this kind</hi> Fuller <hi>takes notice of.</hi> Ibid. &amp; p. 172.</note>, and Debates held, tho' no Synodical Conclusions were form'd; and in all the Five <note n="‖" place="margin">

However even That Business it self was done in One of these Assemblies, the Convocation of 1640; where also their Jurisdiction was exercis'd in a very Notable Instance, the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spension of the Bishop of <hi>Gloucester</hi>

                  <q>In which, he says, upon King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's Return, the Famous Convocation of 1660 met, to remedy those Disorders which the Civil Wars had occasion'd. In order whereunto it was necessary for them at first to settle the Affairs of the Church: but that being done, they were by the
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:48421:157"/>
King's Writ Prorogu'd Eighteen times suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessively; and it does not appear by the Journal of it, which I have seen, that any thing <hi>Material</hi> was done in it afterwards.</q>
He has seen a Journal, it seems, where there are no <hi>Memorandums</hi> of any thing done; and from that Empty Journal One would think that he had learnt all his skill in the Business of Convocations. But had not something else been as Empty as that Journal, he would sure have foreborn giving this as an Instance how Convocations have been employ'd, <hi>whilst</hi> they were us'd to assess themselves (which is his profess'd Design in producing it <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Pag. 141.</note>), when all these Eighteen Prorogations were <hi>after</hi> they began to be Tax'd by Parliament; and all of them were with the Good will and Consent of the Clergy, who by the Favour of their Prince, and the Assistance of the Parliament, had in the first year of their Sitting done so much, that little or no Church-work might remain upon their Hands for several succeeding years. And yet in All those years they were not Idle for want of an <hi>Opportunity</hi> of being other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; for they observ'd their Forms all along, met with every Parliament, and said their Prayers together, and when their Prolocutor dy'd, chose a new one; as even that Journal the Doctor perus'd, as Empty as it was, would have taught him; if I guess right at the Qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from whence this Blunt and Harmless Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row was drawn. Now the observing these <hi>Forms,</hi> whatever Apprehensions Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> may have of it, yet several of his Brethren of the Clergy think to be very <hi>Material</hi>; as being a step to that which is confessedly so, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serving
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48421:158"/>
the Body in their Legal Capacity of Acting, as there shall be Occasion. Particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that part of the Solemnity, the Opening of the Assembly with Prayers and a <hi>Sermon,</hi> as it is a matter of great <hi>Decency,</hi> so is it of some <hi>Use</hi> also; the uttering of these Discourses from the Pulpit having been generally the Province of the Lower Clergy, who took the liberty at such times to lay the State of the Church before the Fathers and Governours of it very nakedly and plainly, and freely to expostulate with them about any Neglects or Mismanagements, they might observe to prevail. I shall give the Reader a few Instances of the Freedom practis'd on that occasion, which may satisfie him that it had its Uses in some special Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures; and may be as serviceable again, when the same Corruptions shall have got into the Church; as it is possible that they some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time or other may, tho' at present we are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so free from them.</p>
               <p>The Passages of this kind I shall take notice of, are in Pieces not easie to be met with; and should therefore my Transcripts from thence be somewhat large, I hope they will not be thought tedious; the Christian Courage, Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, and Zeal that animates these Awakening Discourses will be my Apology for producing so much of them, and for doing it here in the Body of the Book, without referring the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for a sight of them to an Article in the <hi>Appendix.</hi>

                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:48421:163"/>These Three Instances, taken at three several Distances, from the times before the Reformation down to the Latter End of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> will convince the Reader, that the Solemnity of opening a Convocation, is it self a matter of some Importance, and which would deserve carefully to be kept up, even tho' there were nothing Material to be done in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod afterwards. We live in a <hi>Preaching</hi> Age, when the Devotion of People runs much that way, and they are mightily indulg'd in it. Pity it is, that whilst so many New Discourses of this kind are set up for the Laiety, this One good Sermon <hi>ad Clerum</hi> should be put down; which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides that it has some Hundred years Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription to plead for it self, is at least as edifying an Exercise as any of those that are more encourag'd.</p>
               <p>I have examin'd all the <hi>Modern</hi> Instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces produc'd by Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> in behalf of his Darling Point, That <hi>the Chief End of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations is to give Money:</hi> His <hi>Elder</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts would afford as much room for Reflection, if it were worth the while to pursue 'em as minutely. But I suppose there is no great need of proving to the Reader, that a Writer has misled him in Facts of an Ancient Date, when I have shewn that he has done it in things that have hapned within our Memories, and under our Noses. For he that will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48421:164"/>
upon a Man before his Face, will certainly do it behind his Back; and the more out of his Reach he is, the more he will do it.</p>
               <p>It is said, his Superiors have employ'd him in an Edition of these Old <hi>English</hi> Councils. If he deals with them as ill in that Edition, as he has done in this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it will, I am sure, be the faultiest Book in the kind, that ever was Printed; and so far from mending Sir <hi>Henry Spel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>'s Collections on this Head, that it will be worse than Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi>'s. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, should he discharge the Task never so well, his Hand, I think, is not proper to be employ'd in it: for the World will judge it a Preposterous thing for the same Pen to be used in preserving the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Old Canons, and writing down the Priviledges and very Being of Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. I suppose he thinks the Mortal Blow is now given to the Church, and that she will never hereafter speak by her Provincial Assemblies; and therefore, as the way is to give accounts of Men when they are Dead, he thinks it time to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the Acts of a <hi>Departed</hi> Convocation. But he ought to be sure, that it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, before he enters on this Task: for should it ever revive and sit again, one of the first Requests it would make, might possibly be, that the Work should be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of his Polluted Hands: Since the Church cannot hope, from what she knows
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:48421:164"/>
of him, that his Account of her Synods will be given with any other View, than the Learned Fryer wrote the History of that of <hi>Tre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>t</hi>; on purpose to expose 'em. But this is a Distant Concern; Our Business at present is with him only as to the Treatment which these Antient Councils have found from him, in the Work we are upon: and upon this Head, I shall for the Reasons already given, trust the Reader, without entring into the Retail of it; adding on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to what has been already said in this Chapter, one short Remark—That from <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth down to the last Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Prince, no King has sat on the Throne, who did not allow and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage these Meetings of the Clergy. King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Late Reign made the first Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of this kind; when <hi>Popery</hi> and <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> being determin'd to be set up, consequently Parliaments and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations were laid aside, from whence the Greatest Hindrance to those Designs was most likely to come: for tho' the Clergy wrote Popery out of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in a smaller time than they could be expected to have done it in that Method; yet, had they been allow'd to sit in Convocation, they had probably dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd the Work somewhat sooner. But the Oppressive Pattern then first set, will not, we dare say, by our Generous De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverer be follow'd. Frequency of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments has been the distinguishing Mark and Glory of his Reign; and it will add
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48421:165"/>
some small Lustre to it, if it may be said in our Annals, that the Liberties of Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations too were no less tenderly preserv'd. We question not, but so Good and Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Prince, and so great a Pillar of the <hi>Protestant</hi> Religion, will in this respect yield to the Just and United Desires of his Clergy, when they are sufficiently made known to him. No Men resisted the Encroachments of the Late Reign more than They; no Men by their Labours and Zeal contributed more to our present happy Establishment; and they have reason therefore to hope for their share in the Common Benefit of it.</p>

               <p>BUt to return to our Business—Another Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection made by Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> against the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness of the Clergys Assembling with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry New Parliament, is, That when this was Customary, they were a <hi>Member of Parliament</hi>; but not being so Now, neither is there the same reason that they should assemble with it <note n="*" place="margin">P. 106, 107, &amp; (284.)</note>. To this I answer, that the words <hi>Member of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> may be taken differently, as they sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie either an Essential Part of the Legislature, whose Consent and Authority is necessary to all Laws; or a part of the Great Body of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, assembled by the same Writs, at the same time with it, but to some special Intents and Purposes prescrib'd by our Constitution. In the former Sense, the Clergy are not, nor for some hundred Years have been; in the latter, as they always were, so they still, I presume, are a Member of Parliament: Not an <hi>Intrinsick Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> if I may be allowed so to speak, or <hi>Estate of Parliament</hi>; but only an <hi>Extrinsick Part</hi> of it, or an <hi>Estate of the Realm,</hi> call'd with the Parliament always, and attending upon it; who have a Parliamentary Right of Petitioning, and Advising within their proper Sphaere, and at whom Decrees about Matters Spiritual ought regularly to begin. They are a Lesser Wheel in the Machine of Government, that is acted by the same Springs and Weights, and therefore moves and ceases together with the Greater, but has peculiar Ends and Offices of its own to which it serves. Nor is this to be wonder'd at,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48421:166"/>
for even the States of Parliament themselves have different Powers and Priviledges, and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar Orbs of their own, as it were, within which they move; the Lords are distinguish'd by their <hi>Iurisdiction,</hi> and the Commons by their <hi>Money Bills</hi>: so that the being <hi>Member, Part,</hi> or <hi>Parcel</hi> of Parliament, does not necessarily imply the very same Parliamentary Interests and Powers. And the Clergy therefore, though no part of the Civil Legislature, nor concern'd directly in the great Affairs of State transacted in Parliament, may yet in other Respects, and to other Purposes, be properly reputed and styl'd a <hi>Member of Parliament.</hi> And accordingly I have shewn, that they have been thus esteem'd, and spoken of, from the time of their separati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on downwards; and even by <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, many Years after their submission to him. One instance of this kind has been given alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <note n="†" place="margin">P. 59.</note> from a Proclamation in the 35<hi>th.</hi> of his Reign: and because the way of Wording these State-Papers is a matter of great Weight and Importance, I shall here add another, from an Original Direction of the same Prince to his Judges, then about to go their Summer Circuit. It begins thus —</p>

                  </note>: For to say, that by <hi>the Clergy of this Realm,</hi> my Lords the <hi>Bishops</hi> only are intended, were so absurd a Gloss, that even Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s Pen would, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, be asham'd of it. And if they were then rightly said to be <hi>assembled in Parliament,</hi> they may as rightly be said to be so assembled still: and if <hi>assembled in Parliament,</hi> why not a <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Parliament?</hi> to those Intents and Purpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:48421:167"/>
I mean, for which they are assembled in it? Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> will be pleas'd to answer this Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at his Leisure; and withal to inform us, among his late Meditations on the Day <note n="†" place="margin">Serm. on the 5<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>Nov.</hi> 1699.</note>, this had not been a proper one. His Function may be, some excuse for his being a stranger to the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the Statute Book, or of our Manuscript Records: but not to have so much Law as even his Common Prayer-Book would have furnish'd him with, is, let me tell him, inexcusable.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s Foundation therefore failing, the Inference he builds upon it falls accourse, and the Argument will now run quite the other way; that, because the Clergy are a <hi>Part,</hi> or <hi>Member of Parliament</hi> (in a qualify'd Sense) therefore they ought to Assemble with it. However, since that Expression is invidious, and liable to be mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>constru'd, I willingly wave it, and content my self to say, that, though the Clergy are now no <hi>Member</hi> or <hi>Estate</hi> of Parliament, as they once were (not the <hi>Third,</hi> as Dr. <hi>W.</hi> ignorantly talks <note n="†" place="margin">P. 151.</note>, but the <hi>First</hi> Estate of it) yet are they still an Estate of the Realm, necessarily attendant on the Parliament; and have attended as such, whenever a new Parliament was called, from the time that they left off to be an Estate of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, till within a few Years past, with few Exceptions to the contrary; and with none, from the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the VII. to that of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Majesty. And this prescription of some hundred Years has given them an undoubted Right of being summon'd, and sitting as often as a Parliament is summon'd and sits, though they are not a <hi>Member,</hi> or <hi>Estate</hi> of Parliament.</p>
               <p>No more than this need be said, to remove the Objection. But I design not barely to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:48421:167"/>
Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> but moreover to give the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der every where as Comprehensive a View of the Subject in Debate, as the short compass of this Work will allow of; and shall take occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therefore from hence to deduce <hi>an Account of the Interest which the Lower Clergy have had all along in these State Meetings.</hi> 'Tis a point that well deserves our Reflections; and Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> therefore, according to his instructive way, has said nothing of it: No body had gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, and common plac'd our Historians, and Manuscript Authorities to his hand on this Argument; and he never ventures to break the way, or to give us any part of Learning, but what has born the test of Time, and is warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by at least an hundred Years usage.</p>
               <p>A compleat State of this point is not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in a Digression; all I can do here is, to lay before the Reader some of the most Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Passages to this purpose, that have occurr'd to me in our Histories and Records, and to add here and there a few cursory Remarks upon them: which will throw some small Light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to things as we pass, and may suggest matter of juster and sounder Reflections to others, who shall write after me on this Argument. The Proofs taken singly, may few of them perhaps seem full and convincing; however, when uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, I perswade my self, they will carry such an evidence in them, as is not easily to be withstood.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Saxon</hi> times are overspread with Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and yet Light enough is still left us to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, that the <hi>Inferior Clergy,</hi> as well as <hi>La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of the Realm.</hi> Much has been Written on this Point as to the Laiety, but I do not remember that I have met any where an account of the Lower Clergys Interest in those Meetings; and therefore I shall produce some Proofs of it here, without entring into the <hi>Civil</hi> part of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, any further than may be of use to give Light to the <hi>Ecclesiastical,</hi> and to clear the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Rights and Priviledges of the <hi>Commons Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual</hi>; which, I am satisfy'd, ran even all along with those of the <hi>Commons Temporal,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably grew, declin'd, or reviv'd with them.</p>
               <p>The first Instance I shall take notice of to this purpose, is that known Preface to King <hi>Ina</hi>'s Laws, which says, they were made (in the Rude, but Faithful Translation of <hi>Iorvallensis</hi>) <hi>exhortatione &amp; doctrinâ Ceonredi Patris mei, Heddae Episcopi mei, &amp; Erkenwoldi Episcopi mei, &amp; omnium Senatorum meorum, &amp; seniorum sapientum Regni mei</hi>; multâque Congregatione Servorum Dei <note n="†" place="margin">X.

That the <hi>Servi Dei</hi> here men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned were Clergy, bears no doubt; and that the Words are further to be understood chiefly of the <hi>Inferior Orders</hi> of the Clergy, appears both from their <hi>Numbers</hi> (for the <hi>West-Saxon</hi> Bishops and Abbats were but few), and from the like use of the Phrase in other places: for instance, in the Council of <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veshoe,</hi> A.

Something of this Dr. <hi>W.</hi> seems to have been aware of, and therefore slid over these three Instances in hast as it were, and touch'd them tenderly: His account of the first is, That <hi>Ina</hi> made his Laws with the consent of his <hi>Bishops</hi> and all his <hi>Aldermen</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 171.</note>; of the last, That <hi>Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan</hi> publish'd his Ecclesiastical Laws with the Council of his <hi>Bishops</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 162.</note>; and as to the third, he tells us, There was such a Council at <hi>Cloveshoe,</hi> Anno 824. <note n="(⸪)" place="margin">P. 172.</note> and that's all. Very succinct indeed! especially, coming from the Pen of so prolix and tedious a Writer; who fails not to tire us with Circumstantial Accounts of things, when they are unenlightning: But here a pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual Relation might have open'd Eyes, and made Discoveries; and in such Cases Dr. <hi>W</hi>'s. communicative Temper always fails him.</p>
               <p>I shall supply his Defects as to one of these Instances, a little further than I have done, by transcribing a Passage or two from an old Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter granted to the Church of <hi>Worster,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd in the <hi>Register</hi> of it.

This is so clear a proof of what I am contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for, that allowing the matter of Fact true, there is no evading it. Dr. <hi>W.</hi> therefore would fain, if he could, have the Account thought Fabulous; <hi>if</hi> (says he) <hi>the Relation be true, it was indeed an Assembly of an Extraordinary Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> 
                  <note n="(a)" place="margin">P. 171.</note>. But <hi>if</hi> he suspected it not to be true, he would have done well to acquaint us with some of the Grounds of his Suspicions; all which he has discretly kept to himself. And indeed, I cannot imagin what Ground there can be to suspect the Truth of it: There are no Marks of Imposture in it, nothing that disa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees with the Story, or manners of that time. Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi> printed it from five good Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scripts, and one of them, near as Old as the <hi>Saxon</hi> Age. In the Ancient <hi>Saxon Chronicle,</hi> there is at the Year 694. a very large and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular account of this Council: and, least the Dr. should startle at the <hi>Abbesses</hi> being found in such Company, they are expresly mention'd al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so by that Chronicle as present. Nor can this be matter of surprize to any one in the least ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the State of those times, when it was not unusual for <hi>Women</hi> to assist at their Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, and great Councils; witness the <hi>Synod</hi> of <hi>Nidde</hi>

               <p>What is it then that makes Dr. <hi>W.</hi> think this to be an Assembly <hi>of an Extraordinary Composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi> it must be, because he finds <hi>Presbyters</hi> and <hi>Deacons</hi> there: but that this is no such Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Thing, appears from the instances I have already produc'd, and yet further from these that follow.

               <p>At the great Council of <hi>Westminster,</hi> conven'd Anno 1066. by <hi>Edward</hi> the Confessor, upon the Consecration and endowment of that Abby, there was <hi>Generalis totius ferè Nobilitatis An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliae Conventus</hi>

<pb n="284" facs="tcp:48421:171"/>
Infringers of the Priviledges then granted.</p>
               <p>These Instances are so plain as to need no Comment, and to admit no fair Reply. Dr. <hi>W.</hi> indeed seems to have laid in matter for an Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, where he speaks of <hi>Ecclesiastical Synods properly so call'd,</hi> at which the <hi>King,</hi> and his <hi>Nobility</hi> were <hi>present</hi>; insinuating, that we are to distinguish these from those mixt <hi>Saxon</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, <hi>compos'd</hi> originally, and equally of the Clergy and Laiety. But this is an imaginary Distinction, for which there is no foundation in History. There were indeed in these times <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical Synods properly so call'd,</hi> without any intermixture of the Laiety; but there was no Business <hi>appropriated</hi> particularly to these; the most solemn Church affairs being transacted ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally at the State-meetings by the Clergy then assembled; who went aside and consulted among themselves, and then laid the result of their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates before the great Council of the Realm, in order to be confirm'd by them. And wherever therefore we find the several Orders of the Laiety present, we must consider, that that Assembly, where they were present, was a <hi>State Council,</hi> though matters properly of Ecclesiastical Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance were transacted in it. Besides, several of those Councils I have instanc'd in, had <hi>Civil</hi> as well as <hi>Church-affairs</hi> before them, and made Laws in both equally; which is a sure sign that they were not pure Ecclesiastical Synods.</p>
               <p>It may perhaps further be urg'd, that the Lower Clergy present at these State-Councils, were no <hi>part</hi> of them, but call'd only to a Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod by their Metropolitan, at the same time and place that the great Council of the Realm met. But they who shall thus pretend, must produce
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:48421:171"/>
some good Evidences and Authorities to support this pretence, and not expect that we should take their bare word for it; the common appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of History being on the other side. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, allowing this Scheme true, yet is it some proof of the Interest which the Inferior Clergy had in those State-meetings, if they were us'd to assemble <hi>together with</hi> them, though not <hi>in</hi> them; this being the only Interest they at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent claim.</p>
               <p>Not that I believe them to have had place in all (even the most ordinary and stated) As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies, but only in the Greater and more Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary ones; the <hi>Wittena-gemots,</hi> and <hi>Mycel-Synods,</hi> the <hi>Magna Concilia,</hi> and <hi>Pleni Folcmoti,</hi> which are plainly destinguish'd from the less Solemn and Numerous Councils; and which met together only <hi>ex arduis contingentibus, and legum condendarum Gratiâ,</hi> as Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi> observes <note n="†" place="margin">In Voce Gemotum p. 261. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Nor do I suppose that the Clergymen of lower Rank call'd to these Full Conventions treated always as freely, and acted as authoritatively as the <hi>constant and standing Members</hi> did: No, I take them as to this, to have been much in the same case with the inferior Laiety, who are said oftentimes to have been <hi>present</hi> at such great Councils, and to have <hi>consented to,</hi> and <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd</hi> what was done there, but not often to have <hi>deliberated</hi> or <hi>determin'd</hi>; just as the Lesser

                     </gap>his Book.</note> to have interpos'd in them.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine here laid down is no new Scheme of mine, contriv'd to serve a Turn, but what has in the main been long ago asserted by the Learned Mr. <hi>Sheringham,</hi> in his Book of the <hi>Supremacy.</hi>
                  <q>In the <hi>Saxon</hi> Times (says he) Laws were commonly made by the Approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Consent of the Nobles, Archbishops, and Bishops, in a Publick Synod or Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: sometimes the Queen was present, sometimes the <hi>Inferior Clergy,</hi> and sometimes also <hi>the Commons</hi>; but that hapned very sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom <note n="†" place="margin">P. 52.</note>.</q>
Which coming from the Pen of one of known skill in our <hi>English</hi> Antiquities, and in a Treatise not at all design'd to assert the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of the Subject, does on both these accounts carry a particular weight with it; and will with those who have a due regard for that excellent Writer, be a strong presumption of the truth of all I have offer'd on this Argument.</p>
               <p>Another clear proof of the Lower Clergys assisting frequently at those Great Councils, may be drawn from the <hi>Subscriptions of Charters,</hi> where we frequently meet with <hi>Capellani</hi> and <hi>Presbyteri,</hi> and sometimes with simple <hi>Deacons,</hi> among the other Witnesses. One instance or two have been given already, to which these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones may be added.</p>

               <p>It is not however improbable, that under the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Ministri,</hi> some of the <hi>Inferior Clergy</hi> might often be comprehended; especially when these <hi>Ministri</hi> sign'd, as they sometimes did, in great Numbers, and so as to bear no Proportion to the other Ranks of Witnesses, either of the Clergy, or Laiety <note n="†" place="margin">

However, this I propose as a Conjecture only, to be admitted or refus'd, as the Men of more skill in these Matters shall agree upon it: That which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist on, is, that the <hi>Attestations</hi> and <hi>Style</hi> of these Charters make it manifest, that many of the Lower Clergy had place in those great Councils which confirm'd them. How, and in what Capacity they were summon'd thither; whether as representing any part of the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, or as the King's immediate Servants and Dependants, (his <hi>Hand-Preosts,</hi> and <hi>Hir'd-Cleres,</hi> as the <hi>Capellani</hi> and <hi>Presbyteri Regis</hi> are in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Chronicle odly call'd) is another Enquiry, which it is not very easy, nor very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary at present to determin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="291" facs="tcp:48421:174"/>Nor matters it much, whether the Charters I have vouch'd be all <hi>Genuine,</hi> or not: for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing them forg'd, they must be allow'd at least to be well counterfited; or else they would not have pass'd upon knowing Men, when first produc'd. The Monks, who Coyn'd them, were no Bunglers; but understood very well the state of those Times to which they adjusted these In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments, and drew them, no doubt, according to authentick Forms and Patterns. And a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimony therefore taken from thence concerning the Customs and Usages of those times holds near as well, as if they were confessedly <hi>Genuine,</hi> and of the very Age they pretend.</p>

                     <hi>Nicolson</hi> Hist. Lib. Vol. 3. p. 207.</note> pretends to the contrary, who both as an <hi>Antiquary,</hi> and an <hi>Archdeacon,</hi> should have understood this point better. The Words of the Conquerors Writ, whereby he separated the two Jurisdictions, are a plain Proof of this; for they run—<hi>Nullus E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopus, vel Archidiaconus de Legibus Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palibus ampliùs in Hundret Placita teneat,</hi> &amp;c. which implys the Archdeacons to have exercis'd Jurisdiction in the Hundred Courts before the Conqueror came in; especially, if we add the Praefatory Words of that Writ, where he styles these Usages such as had obtaind <hi>in regno An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorum usque ad mea tempora.</hi> But because this matter is with so much assurance deny'd by that
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:48421:175"/>
Writer, and is generally so much mistaken, it may not be amiss, to add a few Instances more; some of which carry the Proof of it above an hundred Years higher than the <hi>Aera</hi> pretended. Sir <hi>H. Spelman</hi>'s Opinion in this Case is of Great Weight, and may go for a General Proof: His Words are,
<q>The <hi>Archdeacon,</hi> in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, had a superintendent Power over all Parochial Parsons in every Deanery of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct <note n="*" place="margin">Rel. <hi>Spelm.</hi> p. 50</note>.</q>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="293" facs="tcp:48421:175"/>'Tis true, the Great Man he mentions, places the Rise of the Archdeacons Jurisdiction no higher than He does: but That was in favour to his Own Order; in which cases the Best and Greatest Men are not allways so Discerning, or so Indifferent as they ought to be. It was a slip of that truly Great Man's Memory, who had not then the words of the Conquerors Writ in his View, which prove the contrary: whereas our <hi>Archdeacon</hi> sleepily produces those very words <note n="†" place="margin">P. 207.</note> but a Page or two before he espouses this Opinion.</p>
               <p>Nor can he pretend, that he is speaking only of the Archdeacon's Jurisdiction, when it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came <hi>Independent</hi> of the Bishops; whereas till the Conquest, he acted merely as a <hi>Deputy</hi>: for besides that this is more than He knows, his Words are plain, that <hi>the Archdeacons had no Iurisdiction</hi> in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times, <hi>their whole Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness being to attend the Bishops at Ordinations, and other Publick Services in the Cathedral</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 209.</note>. And the same is said, but in more forcible Terms, by the Great Man whose Opinion he implicitly transcribes, and approves. But we are not to wonder, that He who so Liberally gives up the General Rights of his Church, should be as ready to quit any Particular Point that is to the Advantage of his Own Office and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>He makes amends however a little after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <note n="*" place="margin">P. 210.</note>, and learnedly proves, that the Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con's Jurisdiction must be somewhat older than the Council of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> from some Trite Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sages in those Constitutions, so notoriously known, that they have not escap'd even Dr. <hi>W</hi>'s Enquirys <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> p. 125</note>. But if he must needs have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:48421:176"/>
a Proof of this lower than the Conquest, why was not the Council of <hi>London</hi> under <hi>H.</hi> the I. thought of? where it was decreed <note n="*" place="margin">Eadmer. Hist. Nor. L. 4. p. 95.</note>, that the Archdeacons should take an Oath about the Execution of the Canons then made; not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at the Breach of them for Money, but se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely to punish Offenders. This would have carry'd his Proof between 30 and 40 Years high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than the Council of <hi>Clarendon,</hi> and would have shew'd his Reader, that he did, not upon such Heads as these, content himself barely to transcribe those, who had transcrib'd others; but convers'd with Original Authors.</p>
               <p>To make all he says on this occasion of a Piece, he further adds, That <hi>we should not have known that the Bishops and Archdeacons were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden by the Conqueror to mix Iurisdiction with the Earl,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in the Hundred, or Shiregemots, but for an</hi> Inspeximus, 1. <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>m.</hi> 12. <hi>n.</hi> 5 <note n="†" place="margin">P. 72.</note>. <hi>Not have known it!</hi> Why, there are divers Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Manuscript Copys, or Accounts of it yet in being, writ long before the time he talks of.

Mr. Archdeacon might have modestly said indeed, that <hi>He</hi> himself <hi>had not known</hi> of this Charter, <hi>without</hi> that <hi>Inspeximus</hi>; and some People would be apt to add, nor <hi>with</hi>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:48421:176"/>
it neither, if he had been to fetch his Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from the Records of the <hi>Tower</hi>: With which had he been acquainted, he would have known, that this <hi>Inspeximus</hi> was of the 2<hi>d.</hi> not of the 1<hi>st.</hi> Year of <hi>R.</hi> II. as he imagines.</p>
               <p>This, I am sensible, is a Digression; but I shall make no Apology for it, either to Mr. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholson,</hi> or the Reader: The One of these, I hope, will overlook it, if he does not like it; and the other may censure it in what manner he pleases.</p>
               <p>Having shewn, that there was by our Original Constitution a difference between the Greater and Lesser Councils of the Realm in the <hi>Saxon</hi> times; and this Distinction being yet more Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the Latter Ages, from the middle of <hi>E.</hi> the I. downwards; as our Records, preserv'd pretty well throughout this space of time, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly testify: We cannot doubt, but that the same Distinction is applicable also to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termediate Period; and that the Conqueror, and his nearest Successors had also their <hi>Magna Concilia</hi> (call'd afterwards <hi>Full Parliaments</hi>) to which the Summons of their Subjects, both of the Clergy and Laiety was more General, and the Resort more Numerous, than to their <hi>Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Courts</hi> and Councils, which were held <hi>de more,</hi> for the dispatch of common Business, and at stated Times. And in such <hi>Extraordinary</hi> Meetings it is, that we must chiefly expect to hear of the <hi>Inferior Clergys</hi> appearance.</p>
               <p>Accordingly in one of them, held in the 11<hi>th.</hi> Year of <hi>William</hi> the I. we find, that a Charter then granted to the Monastery of <hi>Westminster</hi> is subscribed by <hi>Archiepiscopi, Episcopi, Comites,

                  <hi>M. Paris</hi>'s Expressions relating to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reign, are yet Clearer.

                  <note n="†" place="margin">V. Abb. S. Aug. p. 79.</note>. And these last Words are probably those of the Writ it self, by which they were summon'd; and which lay before <hi>Paris,</hi> in the Register of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> that he was then transcribing. In 1162, he tells us that the <hi>Universitas Episcoporum, Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batum, &amp; aliorum Magnatum</hi> met at <hi>Westminster</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">V. Abb. S. Aug. p. 79.</note>: and these <hi>Alii Magnates</hi> are in his History ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd by <hi>Comites, Barones, Archidiaconi, &amp; innumera turba regni</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 99. l. 1.</note>.

               <p>With these accounts agree those which <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vase of Dover</hi> has given us of some Great Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils in the same Reign.

This was by way of <hi>Indulgence</hi> to the Lesser Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, in times, when Summons to Parliaments were very frequent, and consequently Attendance there very Expensive and Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome. And the constitution of <hi>Reading</hi> therefore (so often cited) which first made distinct Proctors from the Rural Clarks of every Diocese, a fixt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary part of the Clergys Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Assemblys, did it not as a <hi>Priviledge,</hi> but a <hi>Burthen:</hi> for it commands them to be return'd, <hi>etiamsi de Conturbatione vel Expensis oporteat fieri men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,</hi> i. e. notwithstanding the <hi>Trouble</hi> and <hi>Charge</hi> it might be to them.

               <p>The Laiety, I find, were at this time indulg'd in like manner, but in an Higher Degree: for in the Parliament of <hi>Oxford</hi> (Ann. 1258.) this Memorable <hi>Provision</hi> was made, which I shall for more than one reason here insert intirely.</p>

And the steps by which their Parliamentary Interest grew to the full Heighth wherein we find it, toward the Latter End of <hi>H.</hi> the III, were such as These. Sometimes the King wanted an Account of the Antient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stomes and Usages of the Realm, and directed Writs therefore to the Sheriffs, to return a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Number of Knights for every County, to inform Him, and his Great Council concerning them: This was practis'd in the Conqueror's Reign <note n="†" place="margin">Chronic.

Sometimes these Knights were, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Sheriffs, to appear in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and account for their several Shires, in relation to some Subsidys formerly granted, the Collection of which they had been appointed to take care off <note n="(⸪)" place="margin">Cl. 4. <hi>H.</hi> 3. m. 5. dors.</note>: sometimes they were call'd up in order to a Grant; <hi>ad providendum</hi> (as the Words of the Writt are <note n="⸫" place="margin">Cl. 38. <hi>H.</hi> 3. m. 7. &amp; 12. dors.</note>) <hi>unà cum Militibus aliorum Comitatuum, quos ad eundem diem vocari fecimus, quale Auxilium nobis in tantâ necessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate impendere voluerint.</hi> They were to take their Instructions from a Country-Meeting, where the Busyness of this Assembly was previously to be debated, and the Result of those Debates was to be layd before the King and his Great Council, by these special Messengers, <hi>quos iidem Comitatus elegerint, vice omnium &amp; singulorum eorundem.</hi> By these, and such steps of these, the <hi>Commons</hi> recover'd their Priviledges, which the <hi>Norman</hi> Conquest seems to have eclyps'd a little, without extinguishing; and not onely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd, but enlarg'd 'em: till they came at last, about the End of <hi>H.</hi> the III. to that Height of Parliamentary Power and Interest which they now enjoy. And by the like steps, I question not, the <hi>Lower Clergy</hi> rose allso; bearing the Commons Company on all these Occasions, as they remarkably did in the Last Instance pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd: where, at the same time that Praecepts went out to the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> to return <hi>duos Legales &amp; Discretos Milites</hi> for every <hi>Shire,</hi> Writs went out also to the <hi>Bishops</hi> to convene the

               <p>It cannot therefore be said, that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were first call'd to Parliament in the 49 <hi>H.</hi> III; but that they then, or there abouts, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be Summon'd thither uninterruptedly, and to grow a fixt and necessary part of the Meeting.

                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:48421:185"/>This Collection of Authoritys is Material, not onely as it affords us a proof, that from the 49 <hi>H.</hi> III. to the 18. <hi>E.</hi> I. the Commons continued to be Summon'd; but as it is a strong Presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion also, that they were so summon'd before it. For had they first been call'd, when the King was under a Force, and in the hands of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Momfort,</hi> as soon as that Force had been remov'd, and the King at Liberty, such a Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise, so ill begun, would certainly have been discontinu'd: whereas we find on the contrary, that the Last Eight Years of <hi>H.</hi> the III. and the first Seventeen of <hi>E.</hi> the I. afford us frequent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances of it. And (which deserves our No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice) it then grew to be most frequently us'd, and most unalterably fix'd, when <hi>E.</hi> the I. one of the most Potent and Glorious Monarchs that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver sway'd the <hi>English</hi> Scepter, was arriv'd at the utmost pitch of his Power and Grandeur. So far is that Excellent Constitution of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we at present live under from owing its rise to the Weakness of our Princes, and the Encroachments made by Rebellious Subjects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Royal Authority.</p>
               <p>As for the Appeal made to our <hi>Records,</hi> it has, I presume, no manner of weight: for what wonder, if in such times of War and Confusion all the Writs of Summons to the Commons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this <hi>Aera</hi> should be lost? The same thing has hapned to the Writs for the Temporal Lords also; none of which Elder than this date are preserv'd: but I hope, it follows not from hence, that they were never before this Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd.</p>
               <p>How Beaten a point soever this may be, I could not forbear saying something to it, as it
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:48421:185"/>
fell in my way; especially since it bears so near an allyance to the subject I am upon: For it is certain (as I have said often, and shall once again repeat) that the Parliamentary Interests and Priviledges of the Commons Spiritual and Temporal ran even allwayes; or, at least, were never far a sunder: and they do therefore, when made out, mutually prove each other.</p>
               <p>And now, having said so much in this case my self, I may the more freely venture to shew the weakness of an Argument that has been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offer'd on the same side, by Mr. <hi>Nicholson.</hi> He has discover'd a Record (where indeed one would hardly look for it) in a <hi>Dictionary</hi>; which, he thinks, plainly proves that the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> had their Representatives in Parliament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Aera</hi> commonly assign'd; and he won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that none who have written on this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, should have taken notice of it <note n="*" place="margin">Hist. Lib. Vol. 3. p. 60</note>. To Ease him of his wonder, I will whisper the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of it to him in his Ear; it was, because those Knowing Gentlemen saw it was frivolous, and not worth the mentioning. The Words, as they stand in <hi>Somner</hi>'s Translation are,— <hi>Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarii qui fuerint electi a Nobis &amp; à</hi> gentis Plebe <hi>in regno nostro,</hi> &amp;c. I have no skill in the Tongue, Mr. <hi>Somner</hi> had certainly a great deal, and Mr. <hi>Nicholson</hi> has some, if at least we may take a Friends <note n="†" place="margin">

However in opposition to both, I must bég leave to say, that either the Original is faulty, or the Translation not proper: and I do this, upon very good Grounds, because it differs from the Translation which the Parliament it self made of this Record: for, as Mr. <hi>Nicholson</hi> ought to have known, it was publish'd by them in three several Languages, English, Latin, and
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:48421:186"/>

               <p>These Testimonys are, I think, sufficient to shew, that from the Conquest down to <hi>E.</hi> the I. <hi>the Inferior Clergy</hi> had Place, and Interest in <hi>Parliament</hi>; being there sometimes in Body, and as representing the Whole, sometimes in Part onely, and as entituled by their Tenures: the Lower Regulars and Saeculars appearing now and then by distinct Proctors of their own, but more frequently by their Priors and Archdeacons, particularly impower'd to that purpose. Nor matters it much, whether they were thus call'd up immediately by a Royal Writ, or by an Ecclesiastical Summons onely, issu'd out at the King's Instance; since, whether cited this way or that, the Effect of their Citation was to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Parliament: and accordingly the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs of those times speak of them as being <hi>of</hi> the Parliament, and as acting <hi>in</hi> it. They might be <hi>summon'd</hi> often, as they <hi>sat, Apart</hi> from the Laie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but as they sat <hi>in</hi> Parliament, though se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately; so were they call'd <hi>to</hi> Parliament, though perhaps after a different manner from
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:48421:187"/>
the Laiety; and did there, together with the Greater Prelates, compose a Full Representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the Clergy, and the first Estate of the Realm.</p>
               <p>This meeting of the Clergy with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was at first in One National, but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in two Provinciall Assemblys. When such Synods of the Province, held concurrently with the Parliamentary Sessions, began, is hard to say: but, to be sure, they were Older than <hi>E.</hi> I. in the beginning of whose Reign they are, we find, by the Constitution of <hi>Reading</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, as Establish'd Customary Meetings: the Archbishop there, with the consent of the Synod, ordaining, <hi>quòd in Congregatione nostrâ tempore Parliamenti proximi post festum S<hi rend="sup">ti</hi>.

               <p>It appears from hence, both that the Clergy were now us'd to attend the Parliament in their Synods Provincial, and that the Parliament it self was now us'd to sit after <hi>Michaelmas</hi>; since it could not else well have been spoken of here as an Assembly that would at that time certainly convene. For this Council of <hi>Reading</hi> sat down 29 <hi>Iuly,</hi> and therefore (as Synodical Sessions were then very short) rose in the beginn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>August</hi>: at which time, there could be no notice of the approaching Parliament (not yet summon'd) but from common Custome and Usage. And the same receiv'd Custome there was also, it seems, for the Clergy at That and
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:48421:188"/>
Other times to attend the Parliament; their <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregatio tempore Parliamenti</hi> being not now first order'd, but spoken of as an antient and authoriz'd Practise. These Clergy-Meetings however, tho' concurrent in <hi>Time</hi> with those of Parliament, yet were not necessarily to be held at the same <hi>Place</hi> also, where the Parliament was open'd; but assembled oftentimes at some other, either in the Neighbourhood of it, or more Remote from it; as the Archbishop thought fit, or the Churches Occasions requir'd. Thus in 1290 (18. <hi>E.</hi> I.) The Parliament met after <hi>Michelmas,</hi> at <hi>Clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ston</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">See <hi>Ry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi>'s Placi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>

                     <hi>Wikes</hi> ad ann.</note>.</p>
               <p>And what the Form of the Archbishops Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to these <hi>Parliamentary Synods</hi> was, we may learn from a <hi>Procuratorium,</hi> relating to this very Meeting at <hi>Ely</hi>; the most Antient In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument of the kind I have ever seen: and by it the Proxys sent have power <hi>ad</hi> tractandum <hi>vobiscum &amp; aliis Venerabilibus Patribus suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganeïs Provinciae Cant. ac etiam totius Cleri Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatoribus in Civitate Eliensi, super his quae Dei honorem &amp; publicam Utilitatem respiciunt, &amp; ad</hi> consentiendum <hi>hiis quae ibidem ad pacem &amp; consolationem Ecclesiae, Dominique Regis &amp; Regni Angliae, Cleri Communitas inspirante Deo providebit</hi>

The first part of which seems to refer to this Assembly, as a Synod of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince; and the Latter, as a Convention of the Clergy, held for State-Ends, in time of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>Thus stood matters, when the Clause <hi>Premu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nientes</hi> was first inserted, and by it the Clergy of both Provinces were again call'd Nationally to
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:48421:188"/>
Parliament, and requir'd strictly to attend at the very Time and Place at which the Parliament assembled. How this Clause was executed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Inferior Clergy, and obey'd by them, and what Interest it gave them in Parliament, has been allready consider'd so fully, that I need enter into no New Account of it.</p>
               <p>But here, in the very Entrance of this Period, a famous Interruption of this New Practise hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: the whole Body of the Clergy fell under the Displeasure of the King, were put out of his Protection first, and out of his Parliament afterwards; and a Great Council of the Realm was held, <hi>Excluso Clero,</hi> without summoning any One of the Spiritualty to it. This Instance some Modern Writers, willing to reduce the Parliamentary Interest of the Clergy as low as they can, are very full of; and Dr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

For which Reasons it will, I hope, be no unacceptable Entertainment to the Reader, if I digress so far as to set this Piece of History in a Truer Light than it has hitherto appear'd; and shew, that neither were the Clergy in this Instance to be blam'd so much, nor was the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of them carry'd so far, as is commonly imagin'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> the First was the most Expensive Prince that perhaps ever sat on the <hi>English</hi> Throne, and had by his Large and Frequent De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands allmost exhausted all his Subjects; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly those of the Spiritualty, upon whom the Burthen still fell heavyest.

<pb n="321" facs="tcp:48421:189"/>
and therfore at last they consented to it; and took out Letters of Protection, directed <hi>Capita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neïs Marinariorum, &amp; iisdem Marinariis,</hi> &amp;c. who, it seems, at the beginning of the Dispute, had been sent to quarter upon them.

And this struggle finally ended in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of the Great Charter, and the Charter of the Forests, enlarg'd by a new Article, which provided, that no state for the future should be tax'd separately, but only by Common Consent of Parliament.</p>
               <p>This is a faithful and full ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that Transaction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the King and his Clergy, which Dr. <hi>W.</hi> neither like a good Historian, a good Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nor a good <hi>Englishman,</hi> has so represented, as if the Clergy had been altogether blameable, and the King had done nothing but what the Laws of the Land allow'd of.

<pb n="324" facs="tcp:48421:191"/>
that vast Heap of Mistakes, his Book, there is not any one Particular, further from Truth than this, or less becoming the Pen that it comes from. They were faulty indeed in applying to the Pope: but it was an Error of those times, when the Pope's Power over the Clergy was thought very great, and carried very far, even by the Consent of the Laiety. Besides, never Men could be more tempted than they were to make use of this Extraordinary Remedy.

For so I find it recorded in a List of <hi>Grievances,</hi> which were by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal presented to the King a Year or two afterwards, and enter'd in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gister of that time, together with the <hi>Answers</hi> to Each, as in a <hi>Roll of Parliament.</hi> At the close of these, the Prelats excuse themselves from consenting to the Contribution desir'd, by reason of the Bull of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi>; to which the Answer annex'd is, <hi>Non placuit Regi, sed Communitas Procerum approbavit.</hi> However, allowing 'em to have done amiss in this Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, yet nothing that they did afterwards needs an Excuse: Their Refusal to comply with the King's Excessive Demands, was not only faultless, but honourable; and the Proceeding against them upon that refusal was altogether Illegal and Barbarous. For we must not think, that this sentence of Outlawry was built on any Legal Forfeiture they had incurr'd, by adhering to the <hi>Pope</hi> against the Crown; no, it was founded purely on their denying to supply the King, according to his Demands: for three years

<pb n="328" facs="tcp:48421:193"/>
in such Vile Offices. No, it was <hi>Iohn de Metingham,</hi> a Clergyman, who utter'd those words, as the Annals of <hi>Worster</hi> expresly tell us <note n="†" place="margin">P. 520.</note>; a fit Instrument, to be made use of in the Oppression of his Brethren! For look through all our History, and you shall find, that wherever the Clergy have smarted under any Great Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, some of their Own Order have been still at the bottom of it; without whose Helping Hand, the Rights and Priviledges of the Church never were, and never would be invaded.</p>
               <p>Thus much, to take off the Aspersions, with which Dr. <hi>W.</hi> has loaded the Clergy of those times, very Indecently, and Untruly. Their Conduct I do not in every respect pretend to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stify: However, I think it capable of a Fair Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, if their Circumstances be consider'd. And accordingly I observe, that among all our Histo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians of Note, Antient or Modern, there is not One, that I know of, who has thoroughly taken the King's part in this Dispute; none, I dare say, that has represented it so much to the Disadvantage of the Clergy, as this Gentleman of the Function has done. And yet several of these were Laymen; particularly <hi>Daniel,</hi> the most sensible of the Moderns, calls the King's Proceeding in this Case, <hi>a strain of State beyond any of his Predecessors</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 194.</note>. It was a Debt I ow'd to Truth, to set this Story right; and I would have done it, had <hi>Iews</hi> or <hi>Heathens</hi> been the Subject of it. Whatever the Popish Clergys faults were, yet want of Love to their Country
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:48421:193"/>
was none of 'em; the true Interests of which they understood, and espous'd generally, and were ever fast Friends to the Libertys of it. They were bad Christians, but good English<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; which is more than can be said for some of their Successors, who, with a Purer Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, have been worse Members of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth than They. Their Dependence indeed on a Forreign Head misled 'em in Church affairs; but against the Exactions and Usurpations even of the Pope himself in Civil Matters, none de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd more loudly, or made a more vigorous stand than They. <hi>Matthew Paris</hi> is an Instance of this kind, worth our notice; who, tho' of a Monastery that ow'd all its Immunities and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptions to the Pope, yet takes the English side all along against Papal Encroachments: and his Works therefore (the best part of our History) are a mere Satyr on the Court of <hi>Rome</hi>; writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten indeed, not in the mannerly way of later times, but however with a Spirit of great Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesty and Freedom. Disinterestedness, a Love of Truth, and a Generous Concern for the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick shine through every Page of him: Qualitys, which it were well, if some Modern Historians, who have spent a great many Popular Invectives against <hi>Monks,</hi> and <hi>Monkish</hi> Writings, had been pleas'd to observe, and imitate, Their Works (as well as Persons) would then have been in much greater Esteem with the Age wherein they liv'd, and have had a much surer Title to the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plause of Posterity. If what I have said of the Popish Clergy be suspected any ways, my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> will vouch for the Truth of it; who, with great Candor and Justice, observes of that very Reign we are upon, that
<q>Allbeit divers Judges
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:48421:194"/>
of the Realm were Men of the Church, as <hi>Briton, Martin de Pateshull, William de Raleigh, Robert de Lexington, Henry de Stanton,</hi> and many others; and that the Honourable the Officers of the Realm, as Lord Chancellor, Lord Treasurer, Lord Privy Seal, Master of the Rolls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> were in those days Men of the Church; yet they ever had such honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and true-hearted Courage, as they suffer'd no Encroachment by any Forreign Power up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rights of the Crown, or the Laws and Customs of the Realm <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Vpon the Stat. of Westm.</hi> I. cap. 51.</note>.</q>
Among so many Excellent Persons, what wonder is it, if a false hearted Clergyman or two were found; true neither to the Libertys of their Country, nor the Interests of their Order? Every Age, and every Body of Men has had (and will have) its <hi>Iohn de Metingham</hi>'s; it is enough if the Age, and the Body they were of has constantly abhorred them.</p>
               <p>From what has been before related, it appears that this <hi>Exclusion of the Clergy from Parliament,</hi> so much talk'd of, is as much misunderstood: for, in the first place, That was really no <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament</hi> from whence they were excluded, but a <hi>Colloquium</hi> or <hi>Tractatus</hi> only, as the Writ of Summons <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Dugdale</hi> Summon. p. 18.</note> expresly calls it. And the common Opinion, that this hapned at the Parliament of St. <hi>Edmondsbury, in crastino Animarum,</hi> is a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mistake; for the Clergy were certainly both summon'd thither <note n="⸪" place="margin">

The Pretence for this Exclusion I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to have been, the Clergys Outlawry, and the seizure of their Temporaltys, which was judg'd a sufficient reason for denying 'em their Writs of Summons. And this also seems to have been the Ground of that famous Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Judges in <hi>Keilway</hi>'s Reports <note n="†" place="margin">fol. 181.</note>; where it is affirm'd, that the King might hold his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament without the Spiritual Lords, <hi>i. e.</hi> when those Lords Spiritual are in the case of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laws, and under a <hi>Premunire,</hi> as they were, when that Judgment was given; and incapable therefore (as Opinions then ran) of their seats in Parliament. But later Times, and greater Authoritys have decided quite contrary; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon several solemn Debates in the House of Commons, 35. <hi>Eliz.</hi> resolv'd <note n="*" place="margin">See Sir <hi>Symonds d' Ewes</hi> Jour. p. 518.</note>, that a Man under an Outlawry was capable of being elected a Member: and what does not disable a single Person from being chosen into Parliament, could be no sufficient reason for shutting the whole Spiritualty out of it, who are <hi>One of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Estates of this Realm</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> c. 1.</note>. All therefore that this celebrated Instance amounts to, is, that the King, having put the Clergy under an Outlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, against Law and Reason, held a select Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of the Laiety without them, against all Rule and Custom. And it must be remember'd, that this was not only <hi>Excluso Clero,</hi> but <hi>Excluso Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulo</hi> too; for neither had the Countys, Citys,
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:48421:195"/>
and Burroughs any Representatives there: and such an Instance can, I am sure, no ways pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice the <hi>Parliamentary Interest of the Clergy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To proceed therefore in our Account of it,— that is, in our Deduction of those particular Passages in our Historys and Records, which prove it all along, from the Insertion of the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munientes</hi> down to the Times of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Three sorts of these there are, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be taken notice of. <hi>First,</hi> Such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>present the Convocation to be a Meeting Coïn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident with the Parliament. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Such as speak of the Convocation Clergy, as <hi>of</hi> the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and <hi>in</hi> it: And <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Such as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the Particular <hi>Intents</hi> and <hi>Purposes,</hi> for which the Convocation Clergy were, and were esteem'd to be, of the Parliament.</p>
               <p>The <hi>First</hi> of these points, as far as Antient Practice is concern'd, our Adversarys seem to grant: or, should they dispute it, yet it has already, in the former part of this Book, by many plain Evidences and Authoritys been made good.

For which reason there is now no mention of it in the Rolls of this Parliament.</p>
               <p>More such Passages as these might be brought in each succeeding Reign; but I shall content my self to step an hundred Years forwards, and produce one only out of the Continuer of the Annals of <hi>Croyland.</hi> In his account of <hi>E.</hi> the IV<hi>th's</hi> last Parliament <note n="*" place="margin">Anno 1483.</note>, he tells us, that the King, <hi>nihil a Communitate subsidii pecuniarii ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petere ausus,</hi> betook himself to the Clergy, <hi>quasi</hi> (adds the Monk) <hi>semel comparentibus Praelatis &amp; Clero in eorum Convocatione, quicquid Rex pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tit, id sieri debeat</hi>

               <p>These, I confess, are not Direct and full Proofs of the Convocations sitting ordinarily with the Parliament, but only intimate and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose it; and are therefore mention'd here, not so much to strengthen that point, which is other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:48421:196"/>
sufficiently secur'd, as to illustrate and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it. The Passages of the second sort which represent the Convocation Clergy, as <hi>of</hi> the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and acting <hi>in</hi> it, have more Weight in them: Some of these I have already offer'd <note n="⸪" place="margin">P. 60. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Parliament, being of it, and acting in it: To what Intents and Purposes they were so, and how far their Parliamentary Interest in these times extended, is to be our Third and Last Enquiry.</p>
               <p>'Tis upon many accounts too nice a Point, to be fully and exactly stated here: Something however, as it falls in my way, I shall say of it; desiring the Reader (as I have done already on other Occasions) to remember, that I meddle not in what follows, with what <hi>is,</hi> or <hi>ought to be</hi> the Clergys Right, or Priviledge <hi>now</hi>; but only with what it <hi>has been</hi> heretofore; and that I act the part of a mere Historian, not of an Advocate.</p>
               <p>Their Great Parliamentary Right was to <hi>Tax themselves,</hi> which they did always by separate Grants, and those antiently neither prescrib'd, nor confirm'd by the Laiety in Parliament. <note n="⸪" place="margin">
                     <hi>till</hi> 32. H. 8.</note>
When therefore in the 4 <hi>R.</hi> II. <note n="*" place="margin">Rot. Par. n. 13.</note> 
                  <q>the Commons proffer'd a certain Summ, so the Clergy, who (they said) had the third part of the Realm, would give as much, it was answer'd by the Clergy; that their Grants never had been, nor ought to be made in Parliament [in that sense of the word, by which the <hi>Parliament</hi> is oppos'd to the <hi>Convocation</hi>] that neither could the Laiety constrain Them in this respect, nor They the Laiety: praying the King withal, that the Libertys of the Church might be still preserv'd, as they had hitherto been; and that the Commons might be requir'd to do their Dutys, as the Clergy would also certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly do Theirs, and had always done.</q>
Upon which the Commons Proposal was with-drawn, and they granted without that Condition. And
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:48421:201"/>
the same Motion was made again, and quash'd, after a very remarkable manner, in the Eighth Year of this King, as I have already had occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to observe.</p>
               <p>This Priviledge they enjoy'd chiefly as to their Old Revenues, with which they were endowed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Statute of <hi>Mortmain</hi>; but for what they acquir'd after that Act, they were rated toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the Laiety, notwithstanding their fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Struggles against it. <note n="†" place="margin">

               <p>Another of their Great Parliamentary Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges was, To begin Bills by <hi>Petition</hi> from themselves, in the same manner as the Commons did; and those Requests, when answer'd from the Throne, by the advice of the King's Great Council, grew Statutes, or Ordinances of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.

or to the Prelates of the Upper House, in order to their being propos'd in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
               <p>The Clergy further claim'd, in those times, to have no Bills in derogation of any of their Priviledges and Immunities pass without their Consent.

                  <pb n="351" facs="tcp:48421:204"/>Such have the Instances been, in which they either claim'd, or were indulg'd a consenting Voice; and for the sake of which, as it should seem, their Summons <hi>ad consentiendum</hi> issu'd out all along, even after their Compleat Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.

And in this Sphaere, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, they still move, and are still a Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Assembly; whose Consent is regularly to be had to all Laws, relating to Faith, or Church-Discipline, when ever the Parliament shall please to enact any; and whose consent, when Previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to such Laws, is, I presume, most Regular. They have still a Right o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> being summon'd <hi>to</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and <hi>with</hi> every new Parliament, and a Right of sitting by vertue of that Summons; in order, not to those High Affairs of State, which they once consider'd jointly with my Lords the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, when they sat with them in Parliament; and which made the Constant Preamble of their Convocation-Writs, long after they separated: but for some Religious Ends, and Church Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses; with which, however, the Safety and Peace of the State is closely interwoven. They are to be ready, to offer to the King and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, what they shall Judge serviceable to the
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:48421:205"/>
Interests of Piety and Good Manners; and to consider of what shall be offer'd to them; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate against what may be passing there to their Disadvantage; and to pray Help of the States, in such matters as may redound both to the Benefit of their Own Order, and to the good of the whole Kingdom. In these, and several such respects as these, the Clergy have still a <hi>Right of Attending</hi> on every New Parliament; and (which ought to be consider'd) the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament have also <hi>a Right of being attended</hi> by them, as their Proper <hi>Assistants, and Councelors</hi> in matters Ecclesiastical, whose Judgment is in many cases to be ask'd even where it may not be follow'd; and whose Resolutions are not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Weight,</hi> even when they are without <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis in this case, as in that of the <hi>Iudges,</hi> the <hi>Masters in Chancery,</hi> and the <hi>King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> learned in the Law; who have a Right of being call'd up to the House of Lords, and to that end can demand their Writs of Assistance: Nor is this all; for the Lords also have a Right of being thus assisted by them; and can there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore claim their attendance, though they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves should be willing to forego it: The Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge is mutual, and not to be wav'd on the one side, without Consent of the other. In like manner, I say, the Convocation-Clergy may be consider'd as the <hi>Council Spiritual</hi> of Parliament; to whose attendance therefore, that August Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is entitled; and in whose Summons and sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting consequently, it is in a near manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd. For should there not be frequent need of their Advice or Assistance, yet as it is for the Honour of the two Houses, that the Clergy
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:48421:205"/>
should be ready always, against there shall be need of it; so is it for their Interest too, to keep up a Title to such Assisting Assemblys, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the Assemblys themselves. It is possible, that there may be no occasion of advising with the <hi>Iudges,</hi> throughout an whole Session of Parliament. Could the Lords certainly foresee this, yet they would not, I suppose, consent that their Summons should, for that time, be drop'd, or even their Attendance excus'd.</p>
               <p>The Argument therefore advanc'd in these Papers must be look'd upon, as a Plea for the Priviledges, not of the <hi>Convocation-Clergy</hi> only, but of the <hi>Parliament</hi> it self also, to which they belong; and to whose Assemblys, Theirs, are now, and from the first settlement of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity among us have been, strictly united: not indeed constantly in the same Respects, and by the very same State-Tyes, and Ligaments; but sometimes by more, and sometimes by fewer; and always by such, and so many, as were need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to preserve, and prove the Union. An Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of these, regularly deduc'd through the several Periods of time, from the earliest <hi>Saxon</hi> Age downwards, has been the business of this Chapter: not with any Aim of retrieving lost Rights, or building New Pretensions on Old dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us'd Practises; but merely to shew, that the Parliamentary Assemblys of the Clergy, are of the Essence of our Government, have been pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd from the foundation of it, and are woven into the Frame of it; and can never therefore without doing Violence to our good Old Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution, be suppress'd.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="354" facs="tcp:48421:206"/>The Ends and Uses indeed of these Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Clergy have been different; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all those Varietys, the Right, and the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise of Convening has still continu'd the same, without being ever, till now, interrupted, or disputed. And therefore (to repeat here at the close of this Chapter, what I have said already at the Entrance of it) it makes nothing against the Clergys Right of Meeting with the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they are now no Member, or <hi>Estate of Parliament</hi> (as Dr. <hi>W.</hi> objects): since they are, however, an <hi>Estate of the Realm,</hi> oblig'd and entitled by the fixt Rules of our Constitution to assemble with the Parliament; and which has, according to this Obligation, and by this Title, assembled with it, now for some hundred Years, since all Pretence of assembling, as an <hi>Estate of Parliament,</hi> vanish'd.</p>
               <p>And now, I have, I think, answer'd all Dr. <hi>W</hi>'s Objections on this first Head; unless we should allow a certain poor Colour of his to pass for an Objection, where he tells us, that <hi>Our Kings have often been wont to hold Convocations when there were were no Parliaments sitting</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Pp. 229. (286.)</note>: from whence he would have it understood, that those two Meetings have no manner of dependence upon one another; and that the King therefore is as much at Liberty to hold a Parliament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Convocation, as he has been to call a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation without a Parliament. To this End he has adorn'd his <hi>Appendix</hi> with a learned List of <hi>Convocations antiently held without Parliaments, or at different Times from them</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Num. VI.</note>: an whole Dozen of which he finds in the Compass of

                     <hi>From</hi> 1287. <hi>to</hi> 1538.</note>. 'Tis a mercy, his knowledge is somewhat stinted in this way: for else, we should assuredly have had fifty Instances more of the kind; since so many at least, might, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that Compass of time, have been fetch'd from our Manuscript Registers, and Printed Historians. I could without difficulty number up the greatest part of them now, if it were either worth the Readers while to have such a List, or related any ways to the present Dispute; which turns not on the King's Prerogative of assembling Convocations out of Parliament (a Right undoubtedly belonging to the Crown in elder Times) but on the Spiritual Subject's Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of being assembled in it. Had Dr. <hi>W.</hi> given us a List of <hi>Parliaments antiently held with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Convocations,</hi> That indeed had been to his purpose, and would have gone a good way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards setling the Point between us. But here he is as reserv'd as one would wish; for from the beginning to the end of his Crude Work, there is not a single Instance of this kind made out, or so much as pretended <note n="†" place="margin">

Nay, to see the fate of misapply'd Reading, even of those twelve insig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant Instances which he has produc'd, no less than eight are evidently mistaken, as to the Dates either of the Parliaments, or Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons mention'd in them.

And I shall proceed therefore to consider and remove the several Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections that lie also against the second Point ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd in these Papers, that <q>the Clergy, when met, have a Right of Treating and Debating

But in truth he mistakes,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:48421:207"/>
or misrepresents the Practise of the Emperors, even in these General and Famous Councils, which (I have shewn him p. 125, 6.) went no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, than to require a preference to that Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Business for the Dispatch of which they were Summon'd, not to exclude their debating on any thing, but what the Emperor propos'd to them.

With what Face then can Dr. <hi>W.</hi> vouch the Practise of these Councils as Precedents for that Degree of restraint he would have laid on an <hi>English</hi> Convocation? With what Truth or Conscience can he affirm, that they <hi>acted intirely according to the Prescription of the Emperors?</hi>

Whatever our Author may think of such Doctrine Now, or whatever he may Hope from it, sure I am, that had he liv'd, and utter'd it, while those Holy Synods were in being, it would not have been two or three Years afterwards before he had repented of it. But Old Councils are Dead and Gone; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing, it seems, may be said of them. Let him not depend too much upon that: for they have Friends still in the World, that may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, yet before he dies, to meet together, and ask him a few Questions. A living Synod may some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time or other think it for its Interest, and find it in its Power, to vindicate the Honor and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Dead ones.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="358" facs="tcp:48421:208"/>Well, if Old Councils cannot afford a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, Modern Parliaments shall.
<hi>Poyning</hi>'s Law therefore is urg'd, which provides, <q>that All such Bills as shall be offer'd to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Ireland,</hi> shall be transmitted hither under the Great Seal of that Kindom; and having receiv'd approbation here, shall be sent back under the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> to be preferr'd to the Parliament of <hi>Ireland</hi>

But what have we to do with Instances fetch'd from <hi>Conquered Countrys,</hi> who must receive what Terms the Victor pleases, and be glad of any? We live among another People, always Jealous of their Libertys, and careful to preserve them: in a Land, where slavery either in Church or State, though sometimes planted, could never thrive. And those Fetters therefore, which might perhaps justly be laid on an <hi>Irish</hi> Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, may not fit an <hi>English</hi> Convocation so well; which is therefore free, because it is an <hi>English</hi> one. But after all, how far does this Law of <hi>Poynings</hi> reach; Our Lawyer tells us, that <hi>it leaves not the Parliament at Liberty to propose what Laws they please,</hi> that <hi>the</hi> Irish <hi>look upon it as Conclusive upon their Debates, and are satisfy'd</hi>: and again, that <hi>we have here an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of a Parliament without Liberty of Debate.</hi> But this is too gross an Imposition upon the Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of his Readers; few of which are so ignorant, as not to be aware, that <hi>Poyning</hi>'s Law layes a restraint only on the <hi>Enacting Power</hi> of their Parliament, but not on the <hi>Debates</hi> of it; which, notwithstanding this Act, are left as free as ever. They can still Treat and Conferr about all Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Causes that are of Parliamentary Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance; they can Petition, Represent, and
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:48421:208"/>
Protest: Nay they can propose what <hi>Heads of Bills</hi> they please, to be transmitted hither, and sent back thither in Form; of which we have had very late and frequent Experience. And how therefore the Abridgment of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Liberty of Debate can be pretended to be justify'd by this <hi>Irish</hi> Precedent, is, I confess, past my <hi>English</hi> Understanding. For, as I take it, the Convocation desires no other Powers and Priviledges, but just what this Parliament claims and practises; and pleads only, that the 25 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. may not be extended to such a Rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and Unjustifiable Sense, as will lay greater restraints upon <hi>Them,</hi> than <hi>Poyning</hi>'s Laws does upon Those of <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But our Letter-writer himself is sensible, that this Instance is not to the purpose: for at the close of it, his Conscience gives a little, and he is forc'd to confess, that the <hi>Irish</hi> Parliament are not under an <hi>Universal Restraint,</hi> nor <hi>wholly mute, till the King gives them Power to Debate and Act</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 44.</note>. Are they not? Why then was it generally said, that they were a <hi>Parliament with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Liberty of Debate,</hi> or <hi>of proposing what</hi> Laws they please, in the very next Lines to these, where it is all unsaid again? What means this Absurd Writer, to place his Inconsistencies so near one another, that one Glance of the Eye discovers them? Even Dr. <hi>W.</hi> is in this respect a more Modest and Wary Manager: for His Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions usually keep their Distance, and may lie hid therefore, if the Reader do not think it worth his while (as few Readers do perhaps) to carry the several parts of his Book in their mind, and compare them one with another. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides, if the <hi>Irish</hi> Parliament is not under an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:48421:209"/>
Restraint, what have we to do with it here<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where we are enquiring after Instances, to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance the laying such an Universal Restraint on the Convocation in <hi>England?</hi> If this be not a Parallel of a Restraint in the <hi>same Degree,</hi> it is no parallel at all: there is no doubt, but such meetings may be restrain'd; <hi>how far,</hi> is the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion. Were Precedents Proofs of the Reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness of such and such ways of acting, yet those Precedents must be exact and full, or they prove nothing. Ay, but <hi>the same Power that disabled them so far, might have put them under an entire disability.</hi> It <hi>might</hi> so, if they were a Province won to the Crown by its Sword; for it might have allow'd them no Parliament at all: but if it allow'd them any, <hi>Freedom of Debate</hi> could not have been deny'd them; without which, in the Apprehensions of Us <hi>Englishmen,</hi> there can be no Parliament. 'Tis true, the <hi>French</hi> use the word otherwise: for with Them it sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies <hi>an Assembly, to which the King's Edicts are sent to be verify'd.</hi> But we are not yet acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with this Sense of the Word, and I hope ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver shall. We took the Term from them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore, when it signify'd something else; and we have taken care to preserve its Original Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Dr. <hi>W.</hi> indeed bids far for introducing the <hi>French</hi> sense of the Word; for he tells us round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>That the</hi> English <hi>Parliament are,<note place="margin">P. (289.)</note> in the main parts of their Debates as much, though not as necessarily directed by the King in what he would have them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult about, as the Convocation it self.</hi> And how far the Convocation is, in his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be directed by the King, his Book informs us. This is harsh Doctrine, to suppose any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straint
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:48421:209"/>
upon the Parliaments Freedom of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and may happen not to go down easily with Those that are concern'd in it. But he thinks he has soften'd it, by saying, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament are in their Debates <hi>as much,</hi> though not <hi>as necessarily</hi> directed as the Convocation. What the meaning of that senseless Distinction is, I cannot see, or how it does him any service. Should we allow him, that his Doctrine curbs the Parliaments Freedom of Debate <hi>as much,</hi> though not <hi>as necessarily,</hi> as it does that of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, would such an allowance mend the matter? or screen him a whit the more from the Just Resentments of Those, who will no more bear being told, that they are <hi>as much,</hi> than that they are <hi>as necessarily</hi> directed in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, as the Convocation is? if indeed the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation can debate of nothing, till they are qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd for it under the Broad Seal of <hi>England.</hi> I am mistaken, if this be not, to wound the Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tys of Parliament, through those of Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The Instance of the <hi>Lords of the Articles</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> is as little to the purpose. They were a Previous Committee, compos'd of some Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Estates of Parliament, thro' which every Act was to pass, before it could come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the States themselves. But they were no bar upon the Debates of Parliament; where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Subject might be started and discuss'd, any Requests or Proposals to the Prince might be drawn, whether these Lords had made way for such Considerations or no. However, the check which this gave to the Parliament in their Legi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislative Capacity, was thought a Badge of slave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by the <hi>Scotch</hi>; and therefore towards the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:48421:210"/>
of this Revolution, when the Chains were knock'd off every where from his Majesty's Subjects, this Committee was abolish'd. And had the <hi>English</hi> Clergy then lain under any un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due Restraint, They too might have hop'd for a Relief from it, assoon as any men; since none had been more Instrumental than They in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the Common Deliverance. They might have expected a legal Relaxation of the Rigor of any Law that lay hard upon them: but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of this, their only Request is, that an Act made in Abridgment of their Priviledges may not be constru'd to an Illegal and Oppressive Sense; that they may enjoy their Old Rights, which they stand possess'd of by Law; and that no New Encroachments may take place upon them. Which is so very Modest a Plea, as may be made by any Body of Men, even without Merit on their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>de; and cannot when under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood, be deny'd them without Injustice: and therefore, I am confident, when <hi>it is</hi> understood will not be deny'd them.</p>
               <p>Having taken off this General Colour, drawn from the Authority exercis'd over such Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings as these, in other Times and Countrys, I go on now to what has been objected more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and closely. And the first Exception of Weight that lies against the Claim made, is, That the <hi>Perpetual Practise</hi> of Convocations, ever since the 25 <hi>H.</hi> VIII<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> runs otherwise: and this indeed, were it true, would be a strong one.

<pb n="363" facs="tcp:48421:210"/>
Journals of every Convocation since that Act, and seen the King's several Commissions enter'd there. By that time he is got to the second Page of his Preface, we have him affirming, that the Sense of the Act given is <hi>repugnant to the Constant Practise of our Convocations ever since the time of</hi> H. VIII. <hi>This is certain,</hi> he says, <hi>nor does he Himself</hi> (against whom he writes) <hi>deny it.</hi> Indeed 'tis just as certain, as it is that that Writer yields it; who says only [in answer to a Question there put, <hi>whether the Convocation may conferr without a License?</hi>] that <hi>the Common receiv'd Opinion is in the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 40.</note>. But not a word has he there, or any where else, about the <hi>Practise</hi> consequent upon that Act: and he speaks only of the Opinion <hi>at present</hi> receiv'd, without entring into the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Elder times. So that Dr. <hi>W.</hi> represents his Adversarys Positions just as honestly as he argues against them. Indeed should that Author have allow'd the stream either of <hi>Practise</hi> or <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> to have been always contrary to his sense of the Act, he had been (as Dr. <hi>W.</hi> now is) un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Gross Mistake; for it is certain, that both General Opinion and Practise were on his side for many Years after the Act pass'd. Upon a strict Enquiry into the matter, I find no Instance of a <hi>Commission to treat,</hi> that is not Threescore and ten Years younger than the Statute it self. The several Convocations in the 12 last years of <hi>H.</hi> the VIII. those of <hi>E.</hi> the VI<hi>th.</hi> of Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> and Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> all, for ought I can find, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without any such Commission, or License in writing; and the first time we meet with it on Record, is, in 1603, when King <hi>Iames</hi>'s first Synod met, to settle the Discipline of the Church,
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:48421:211"/>
in that Body of Canons, which at present ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Nor is there any <hi>Opinion,</hi> I believe for the Necessity of such a License, elder than this Practise: at least I have not had the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune ever to meet with any, though I have dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently sought for it. 'Tis true, the Registers of most Convocations, summon'd since this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, were lost in the Fire of <hi>London</hi>; however large Extracts out of several of them are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serv'd, and compleat Transcripts of some: and in none of these is there the least Footstep of any License under the Broad Seal to be seen, but very plain Intimations to the contrary; as I shall now by some Remarkable Passages taken from thence, and from other Books and Papers of good Authority shew. And if I am somewhat Larger in my Recitals of this kind than is abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely necessary, the Reader, I hope, will easily forgive me: What does not directly tend to esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish my Assertion, will serve at least to give some small Light into the Methods of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing usual in Convocation, which the Author of the Letter to a Convocation-man rightly observes to be little known, or minded. And Dr. <hi>Wake,</hi> who smiles at his Remark, is himself a most Contemptible Instance of the Truth of it: since he has ventur'd to write a Book, about the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms and Priviledges of Convocations, without having perus'd the Acts of almost any One <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> Synod; and has from the beginning to the end of his wretched Performance, prov'd no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing effectually, but his own profound Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Subject he is engag'd in.</p>
               <p>I shall take the Rise of my Enquirys from the Convocation which sat, upon a Prorogation, <hi>Nov.</hi> V. 1532. before which the <hi>Submission of

the Clergy</hi> was <hi>made</hi> to the King, but not yet <hi>Enacted:</hi> so that though it oblig'd them not Then as a <hi>Law,</hi> yet it bound them as a <hi>Promise</hi>; by the Terms of which, if a <hi>Commission to Treat</hi> had been then held necessary, we may be sure, they would not so soon after the making that Promise have treated without one. And yet I find no Hint of a Commission in a Diary of that Meeting, where a great many things of much less moment are set down; and where, it being the first time the Clergy met after they submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, had any such thing been practised, we should without fail have heard of it. <hi>Sess.</hi> 11. <hi>Martii</hi> 26. 1533. this Note is inserted,—<hi>Tunc verteba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur in dubium, an liceret disputare in Negotio Regio, eò quòd Negotium pendet coram summo Pontifice indecisum.</hi> Which Doubt the President remov'd by producing the Apostolick Brief, that gave leave <hi>cuilibet Opiniones suas dicere; &amp; Dominus Praesidens instanter rogavit omnes ut diligenter inquirerent de ista quaestione, &amp; refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent quid sentirent.</hi>

                        <hi>I have laid these Instances together, that we may see clearly, what the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stom then was, and how a Message from the King by the President supply'd the place of a Commission under the Broad Seal, which was afterwards practis'd.</hi> Heylin <hi>and</hi> Fuller <hi>have translated some of these Passages in their Historys, but so loosly, as to accommodate them to the Current Doctrine and Practise of their time, when a License</hi> to Treat <hi>was held necessary.

The only Instance in <hi>H.</hi> the VIII<hi>'s</hi> time that seems to contradict this, is the Divorce of <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve</hi> in 1540, mention'd by <hi>L. M. P.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 40.</note> which he says,<q> the Clergy could not take cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of, till the King's Commission im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power'd them to debate and consider it.</q>
                  <hi>And in their Iudgment therefore they recite that Commission at large, and by vertue of it declare,</hi> &amp;c. They do so; and there were Two very good Reasons for it, arising from the <hi>Matter</hi> about which they were to give their Judgment, and from the <hi>Manner</hi> also in which they were to handle it. As to the first of these, the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting any thing by Word or Deed against this Marriage of the King with <hi>Anne</hi> of <hi>Cleve,</hi> was High-Treason (or at least<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Misprision of Treason) by the Laws of the Realm; as the Clause of Pardon in the Act <note n="†" place="margin">32. <hi>H.</hi> 8. c. 25.</note> for dissolving this Marriage evidently shews. And the Clergy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:48421:214"/>
had reason to desire a <hi>Commission</hi> from the Crown, to screen them from these Penealtys. But further, such a Commission was necessary, not only for their security in a point of this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, but in order to their very <hi>Assembling.</hi> For (which has not been hitherto observ'd) this Cause was adjudg'd, not in a <hi>Convocation</hi> properly so call'd, that is, in a <hi>Provincial Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod</hi>; but in a <hi>National Assembly</hi> of the whole Clergy of either Province: the King issuing out his <hi>Letters Commissional under the Great Seal</hi> (as the Sentence <note n="*" place="margin">

The Lords and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons then sitting had petition'd the King to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr it to his Clergy, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of grounding an Act of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament on Their Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Business requir'd Haste <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>The Commission was seal'd the</hi> 6<hi>th. of</hi> July, <hi>the Clergy met by Vertue of it the</hi> 7th. <hi>The Cause was heard, Iudgment given, and Letters Testimonial of that Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment drawn up, and sign'd by all the Clergy on the</hi> 9th. <hi>such Dispatch was requir'd of them. On the</hi> 10th. <hi>the Archbishop of</hi> Cant. <hi>reported it to the Lords and Commons. On the</hi> 11th. <hi>the King let the Queen, then at</hi> Richmond, <hi>know what was done, and had her Consent to it; and on the</hi> 12th. <hi>a Bill was brought into the House an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling the Marriage, which</hi> (<hi>says my Lord of</hi> Sarum <hi>Vol.</hi> 1. p. 282.) <hi>went easily through both Houses.</hi>
                  </note>, for the Summer was now far come on, and the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of Necessity soon to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perse; it could not therefore be committed separately to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations of either Province, there to be transacted in a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner: But all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops of the Province of <hi>York</hi> being present in Parliament, and all the Clergy of that of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> being ready hard by in their Convocation; the King took this way of joyning both together by his Commission, and forming One National As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly.
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:48421:214"/>
To these he recommended the Discus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of his Case, so that what should be by them determin'd, <hi>id demùm</hi> (says he) <hi>Totius Ecclesiae nostrae Autoritate innixi licitè facere &amp; exequi audeamus.</hi> It is manifest, that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to <hi>Treat</hi> (or rather <hi>to Sit</hi>

                  </note>) was here necessary to be issu'd out, for such Reasons, as sufficiently distinguish both this Meeting, and their Business from those we are discoursing of. To proceed therefore to the times of <hi>E.</hi> VI. In his first Year I have shewn the Custom still continu'd for the President to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the King's good Pleasure to the Houses, Orally, without producing any License under the Broad Seal. 'Tis true, there is the <hi>Draught of a Petition</hi> of this Year preserv'd, which seems at first sight to imply the contrary; and shall be fully consider'd under a separate Head: All I shall here say to it is, that should the Sense of the Inferior Clergy be justly express'd in this Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, at the opening of this Convocation, yet 'tis certain they continu'd not long of this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion; but were soon satisfy'd, either from the Answer made to them by the Bishops, or some other way, that their Fears of incurring a <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire,</hi> if they treated without a Commission, were vain and groundless; because we are as sure as we can be of a Negative of this nature at this distance, that in all the Convocations for many Years after this they treated without one.</p>
               <p>In the 6<hi>th.</hi> of the same Prince (1552) that Convocation met in which the first 42 Articles pass'd, whose Title is, <hi>Articuli de quibus in Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nodo Londinensi</hi> Anno Dom. 1552<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

And the same Intimation was given, I suppose, by <hi>Bonner,</hi> the President of the Upper House, to the Bishops; or rather to both the Houses joynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and his Speech reported afterwards by the Prolocutor to the Lower Clergy; as the Custom is for the Speaker to do in Parliament.

But this License being too General, and expressing matters of <hi>Iurisdiction</hi> and <hi>Dispensation</hi> only; it was thought fit to add another, <hi>for the more ample Declaration of those Letters Patents</hi> (as the Words of it are); and therein to specify the Power of holding Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nods, and framing Constitutions Legatine, and
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:48421:216"/>
to indemnify the Clergy particularly for meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and acting under that Authority.
<q>This (says the Bishop) was thought safe on both sides, both for Preserving the Rights of the Crown, and securing the Clergy from being afterwards brought within the Statute of <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munire,</hi> as they had been upon their acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi>'s Legatine Authority <note n="†" place="margin">Vol. 2. p. 324.</note>:</q>
For the Old Laws against <hi>Provisions,</hi> which brought the Clergy then under a <hi>Premunire,</hi> were still in force. This was the Reason of the second License, which could have no manner of regard to the 25 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. for that Act was Then repeal'd.

The Observa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion naturally arising from hence is, That if any other License of this Nature had from the Time of these Legatin Synods down to that of <hi>Iames</hi> the I. been granted, it would also either in the <hi>Rolls,</hi> or <hi>Registers</hi> be found: But none such (that I can hear of) appearing there, we have all the Reason in the World to conclude, that none issu'd.

<pb n="376" facs="tcp:48421:217"/>
that it was Customary for the Convocation to be <hi>directed</hi> to the subject of their Debates by the Crown, even when the 25 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. lay under a Repeal (as it now did): and such <hi>Directions</hi> therefore given at other Times, when the Statute was in force, must not be supposed to spring from this Act so much as from the King's known Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative, by which he ever propos'd both to <hi>Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Convocations,</hi> at their first opening, the Reasons which He, <hi>on his Part</hi>

                  </note>, had to assemble them. But this only by the bye.—The Protestant Convocations held after this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute was reviv'd, are a plain proof of the Truth of that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position I have given of it. For in a <hi>Directory</hi> of Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s, prescribing the Method of opening them, though every step that is at such times to be taken be minutely set down, and the summ of whatever the Archbishop, or any other, is on that occasion to do, or say, be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinctly mention'd; yet of his producing a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission to Treat,</hi> not a word is said: as 'tis natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to think there would have been, had such a Commission been practis'd. I shall give the Reader a Copy of this <hi>Directory</hi> among the other Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers <note n="†" place="margin">

We are hastning on, I find, into so Thorough an Ignorance of these matters, that it may, for ought I know, within a while, be urg'd as a Reason for not holding a Convocation, that we do not understand the Manner of holding it. I am sure this is as good a Reason as any that has been yet given for it. I call this Paper Archbishop <hi>Parker</hi>'s, because by
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:48421:217"/>
the Company I find it in, I have reason to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it so to be. However, it was certainly drawn up, since the Reformation, either in King <hi>Edwards,</hi> or in the beginning of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign; for there is no mention in it of the <hi>Mass,</hi> or of <hi>Abbats,</hi> and <hi>Priors:</hi> and it is of use there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to prove the Practise of those <hi>Protestant Conocations</hi> which we are enquiring after. But this is only a General Proof.</p>
               <p>More Particular and Express to our Purpose is the Synod of 1562. where Matters of Great Moment were transacted, the <hi>Articles</hi> of the Church, and the <hi>Catechism</hi> review'd; and seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Canons</hi> relating to Discipline fram'd, though some of these were not at that time publish'd. And the Debates on these occasions were all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd upon, and manag'd without any <hi>Commission</hi> from the Queen; as is manifest beyond a Doubt, from the Acts of that Synod, of which I have seen an Exact and Entire Copy, written in an Hand of the Time, and taken from the Registers of that Convocation, soon after it sa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

These Acts are very Particular and Minute in giving an account of the Proceedings of every Day, and do orderly specify all the Publick Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments that any way concern the Synod: But as to a <hi>Commission</hi> to Treat, they are perfectly silent.

               <p>The Reader sees that the Business here gone upon was as great and weighty as perhaps ever employ'd any <hi>English</hi> Synod: The <hi>Doctrine</hi> of the Church was here setled in the <hi>Articles,</hi> and the <hi>Catechism,</hi> and new Rules of <hi>Discipline</hi> form'd; and all this was done without any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious License, except what was contain'd in that General Message deliver'd by the Archbishop in his Speech which I have already mention'd. It is further observable, that the Review of the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles</hi> took its Rise from the Lower House; that the matter of the <hi>New Canons</hi> was There first suggested and drawn into Form; and that every thing almost that was done, came Originally from Them to the Upper House, and not from the Archbishop to Them: and was not the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect therefore of any Royal Command, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation, but a Free Act of the Body.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Which shews indeed, that the Synod in 1597 <hi>desir'd,</hi> and had <hi>leave</hi> for the Canons they pass'd, and implys further, that both their <hi>Request,</hi> and

the <hi>Answer</hi> to it were very probably in writing; since it could not else have been <hi>recited</hi> in the Ratification of them.

               <p>
                  <hi>L. M.

But had that Writer seen the Commission it self, and not guess'd at the Contents of it from a

The Book of Common-Prayer was establisht by an Act of the 1<hi>st.</hi> of the Queen, in which it was provided, that <q>if there should happen any <hi>Contempt,</hi> or <hi>Irreverence</hi> to be used in the <hi>Ceremonys</hi> or <hi>Rites</hi> of the Church by the <hi>mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>using</hi> of the <hi>Orders</hi> appointed in that Book, the Queens Majesty might by the Advice of her Commissioners, or of the Metropolitan, ordain and publish such further <hi>Ceremonys</hi> or <hi>Rites,</hi> as might be most for the advancement of God's Glory, the Edifying of his Church, and the due Reverence of Christ's Holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries and Sacraments <note n="*" place="margin">Cap. 2.</note>.</q>
In vertue of this <hi>Proviso,</hi> King <hi>Iames</hi> in his first Year gives Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to the Archbishop, and the rest of the High-Commissioners, to review the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-Prayer-Book; and they accordingly made several Material Alterations and Enlargements of it, in the Office of Private Baptism, and in several other Rubricks and Passages; added five or six new <hi>Prayers,</hi> and <hi>Thanksgivings,</hi> and all that part of the <hi>Catechism,</hi> which contains the Doctrine of the <hi>Sacraments.</hi> Which last Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions would not, I conceive, have been in the

The Drawer up of the Commission was aware of this, and supplys therefore what was wanting in this Provisional Clause, by some General Words, and by a Recourse to that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhaustible source of Power, the <hi>King's supreme Authority and Prerogative Royall</hi>; which, it seems, was at that time conceiv'd to extend so far, as to enable the Crown to make Alterations of Great Importance in a Book establish'd by Act of Parliament, to authorize the Book thus alter'd, and to forbid the Use of the Other. I question whether such a Proceeding would now be thought Legal; but then it went down quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and in vertue of it, the Common Prayer-Book so alter'd, stood in force from the 1<hi>st.</hi> of K. <hi>Iames</hi> till the 14 <hi>C.</hi> II. when, upon a new Review, it was again confirm'd by Parliament. I shall place this Commission in the <hi>Appendix</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">N. XVIII</note>, that the Reader may have an Instance, what the Doctrine of that time was concerning the Extent of the Prerogative in Church Matters, and from thence cease to wonder that a Formal <hi>Commission to treat,</hi> &amp;c. should be <hi>first</hi> granted to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation a few Months afterwards. I say <hi>first</hi> granted; for there is no <hi>Suspicion</hi> of any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding License of this kind, but in 1597. only: and that rises no higher than a <hi>Suspicion</hi>; there being stronger Probabilitys against it, than for it. And thus, I hope, I have effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mov'd Dr. <hi>W</hi>'s Argument about the sense of the <hi>Act</hi>

Convocations <hi>ever since</hi> the framing it; which he appeals to so frequently, and with so much Calmness and Security, that one less acquainted with him than I am would have been tempted to think, that he spake upon good Grounds, and had well consider'd what he said: Whereas in truth he was merely upon the Conjecture; and having found that the Convocations of 1640. and 1603. acted by Commission, concluded pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently that all the Precedent ones must have done so too; forgetting in the mean time that wise Maxim of his Own, with which he very fitly introduces as wise a Chapter.
<q>So great (says he) is that Uncertainty to which all Human Constitutions are expos'd, that tho' I have before sufficiently shewn, what the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of our Convocation at present is, and what Authority our King's have over it, yet <hi>we can by no means from thence conclude, that this was always the case</hi> 
                     <note n="†" place="margin">P. 147.</note>.</q>
Which deep Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, had it been in his View throughout his Book, would have instructed him not to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min so peremptorily upon the Course of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Practise from some Modern Instances; it would have sav'd him the shame of slipping in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to so many false and groundless Assertions on this Head, and me the trouble of exposing them. When he resolv'd, for Reasons best known to himself, to set up for a Champion in this Cause, he should either have taken care fully to instruct himself in the matters he wrote of; or at least, where he was conscious of his want of Light, he should have had the Discretion to express himself a little more warily.</p>
               <p>The oldest <hi>Aera</hi> therefore of these Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which impower the Convocation to Treat,

                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is 1. <hi>I.</hi> 1. how that New Precedent came then to be set, and what Restraints it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd to have laid on the Clergys Liberty of Debate, I shall now briefly enquire.</p>
               <p>It must be confess'd that K. <hi>Iames,</hi> who had been somewhat less than a King in <hi>Scotland,</hi> took upon him to be somewhat more than a King, assoon as he came to the Crown of <hi>England</hi>; spoke of his Prerogative in a very high tone, look'd upon it as some <hi>Innate Power,</hi> divinely annex'd to the Kingly Character, and did not stick to call it so frequently in his Speeches and Messages <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>See his Speech to the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Ministers,</hi> Spots<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood p. 534. <hi>Letter to the Assembly of</hi> Perth. <hi>ib.</hi> p. 537.</note>; and sometimes to talk even of <hi>a Sovereign and Absolute Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> which he <hi>enjoy'd as freely as any King, or Monarch in the World</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>See his Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in</hi> 1605. Spotswood p. 488.</note>. Bishop <hi>Bancroft,</hi> who had corresponded with him for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly in <hi>Scotland,</hi> knew his Temper well: and, the Church having then Great Business to do, and He himself some, (for the See of <hi>Cant.</hi> was then void) contriv'd, we may imagin, how to humor it in the approaching Convocation, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in He was to Preside; and to that end procur'd this Ample Commission, as an Instance of the great Deference and Submission which the Church of <hi>England</hi> paid to the Royal Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Indeed the Clergy had reason to shew all the Marks of Duty and Respect that were fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to a Prince that had shewn himself so fast a friend to them, as K. <hi>Iames</hi> in the <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> Conference, which immediately preceded this Convocation, had done: Where he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd openly for All the Rites and Ceremonies of the Church, against the Scruples of those, who were then called <hi>Puritans,</hi> and had pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:48421:223"/>
commanded them to Conform. This, I say, may be suppos'd to have wrought on the Clergys Gratitude, and made them easier to accept such a <hi>Commission</hi> now, than they would have been in any other Juncture: especially since by it, though they might seem to abridge their Liberty in One Respect, yet they certainly enlarg'd it another. For whereas in Former Convocations, which were not thus Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, the Custom had been to draw up their Rules and Canons in an Unauthoritative Style, and without denouncing Spiritual Penaltys on the Infringers of them (according to the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern set by the Old Canons); here the Clergy first began solemnly to <hi>Decree</hi> and <hi>Ordain,</hi> and to annex the Sentence of <hi>Excommunication</hi> to the Breach of those Ordinances. The Canons of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, where they run most in the Style of Authority, do yet rise no higher than to a <hi>Cautum est nequis</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">

Something too of
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:48421:223"/>
this Caution might be owing to the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances and Temper of the Times, when there was no good understanding between Them, and the Great Men of the Law, the Two Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions clashing mightily; and when those who underhand blew the Coals between Them and the Nonconformists, were uneasy under the Clergys late Victory at <hi>Hampton-Court,</hi> and would not have been sorry to see them make an ill use of it, or to have had any Handle towards disputing the Legality of their after proceedings. On this account a License under the Broad-Seal might be thought convenient, to cover them, not so much from the Law it self, as from Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Complaint and Misconstruction. And if these Reasons may be suppos'd to be then of weight for the beginning this Practise, they were yet stronger afterwards for the continuance of it, in 1640. when the Passions and Prejudices of Men ran even higher against them than Now, and every thing they did was more likely to be misinterpreted.</p>
               <p>Thus far, by way of Enquiry into the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Grounds and Motives from whence this New Precedent may be suppos'd to have sprung: let us now see how far the Clergys Liberty of Debate was really affected by it; and we shall find this not to have been to such a Degree as is commonly imagin'd. For in relation to this <hi>License,</hi> there are Three things that deserve to be consider'd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That it was not granted the Clergy imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately upon their first coming together. The Convocation had sat from <hi>March</hi> 20. to <hi>April</hi> 12. that is, three full Weeks, without a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission, and to be sure therefore had in that
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:48421:224"/>
time <hi>Treated</hi> without one; and did not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore think themselves unqualify'd for all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Synodical Debates, till they were so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission'd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It is very observable, that in the King's <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Patents of Confirmation</hi>

                     <hi>See them in the</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish <hi>Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Canons in</hi> 1603.</note> reciting this Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense, there is a plain difference made between his <hi>Prerogative Royal and Supreme Authority in Causes Ecclesiastical,</hi> and the <hi>particular Powers</hi> lodg'd in him by the 25 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. In vertue of the <hi>first</hi> of these, he is said to have <hi>granted</hi> the Clergy <hi>full free and lawful Liberty,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, treat, debate,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>upon</hi> Canons; but to have given his <hi>Royal Assent</hi> to those Canons, <hi>accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the form of a certain Statute, or Act of Parliament, made in that behalf, in the</hi> 25th. <hi>Year of the Reign of K.</hi> Henry <hi>the</hi> VIII. <note n="†" place="margin">

It cannot be inferr'd therefore that either the Givers or Takers of this new Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense understood the Submission Act in a Sense different from what we contend for, since it does not appear that the Grant of this License was really found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that Statute. However, supposing it was, yet are we to consider in the</p>
               <p n="3">3 Place, that it is not a bare <hi>License to treat</hi> that is there granted, but beyond this (as the words run)
<q>A full free and lawful Liberty, License, Power and Authority to conferr, treat, debate, consider, consult, <hi>and agree of and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> such Canons, Orders, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
Now though a
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:48421:224"/>
License to <hi>debate</hi> of Canons was not necessary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Act, yet a License to <hi>agree upon</hi> them might be judg'd necessary; the Clergys <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing upon</hi> Canons (especially in such an <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative Form,</hi> and with such <hi>Sanctions</hi> and <hi>Penaltys,</hi> as I have shewn them now first to have practis'd) being liable to be constru'd to a sense equivalent to <hi>Enacting</hi> or <hi>Making</hi> them; which without the <hi>Royal Assent and License,</hi> they were by the Act expresly prohibited to do. The License to <hi>Treat</hi> therefore is not to be taken se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parately, but in conjunction with <hi>agreeing of and upon</hi>; and must be suppos'd necessary no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise, than as it qualify'd the Clergy so to <hi>treat</hi> of Canons, as to <hi>agree</hi> also, and come to a <hi>Conclusion</hi> upon them. And thus therefore the <hi>Latin</hi> Title of these Canons (which Dr. <hi>W.</hi> acknowledges to be truly <hi>Authentick and Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi>

But this is according to his usual Sincerity in these Matters; one Instance of which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready observ'd to the Reader.</p>
               <p>The <hi>English</hi> Title of these Canons confirms what has been said, and gives us further Light in the case; it is thus worded.</p>
               <p>Constitutions and Canons Ecclesiastical, <hi>Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon</hi> by the Bishop of <hi>London,</hi> President of the Convocation for the Prov. of <hi>Cant.</hi> and the rest of the Bishops and Clergy of the said Province:</p>

               </p>
               <p>Here is no mention of the Kings License for any Act previous to their <hi>agreeing upon</hi> these Canons; which is a good Evidence that the Framers of them thought there needed none: and though, by the form of their Commission, a free Liberty was granted them to <hi>treat, debate and agree</hi>; yet that really they had occasion for such a Grant, only as to the last of these Acts, but not as to the Former. For had the One been equally ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary with the other, they would have taken equal care to express it. Dr. <hi>W.</hi> indeed excepts
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:48421:225"/>
against this <hi>English</hi> Inscription <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>App.</hi> p. 25.</note>, and says, it is <hi>very imperfectly rendred</hi> from the Latin, <hi>and apt to lead men into mistakes about these matters</hi>; believing, it seems, that the Translation of these Canons into <hi>English,</hi> was the work of some Private Hand, unauthoriz'd by the Convocation: whereas he should have known, that the way was for the Convocation to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare both her <hi>Articles</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>The</hi> Articles <hi>of our Church were at the same time prepar'd both in</hi> Latin <hi>and</hi> English; <hi>so that both are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually</hi> Authentical. <hi>Bishop of</hi> Sarum<hi>'s Exposition,</hi> &amp;c. p.

And in the present case it may be question'd, whether the <hi>English</hi> Canons be not rather somewhat <hi>more authenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> than the <hi>Latin</hi> ones; since it was <hi>That</hi> Copy of them, which seems particularly to have pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Great Seal, and was, with the King's Ratification at length annex'd, then publish'd from the Press Royal. And as low an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion as Dr. <hi>W.</hi> has of Convocations, I hope he will allow them able to translate their Own Latin, and to understand their own meaning. But should there in rendring the Latin Title, any casual Mistake have happen'd, it would have been set right afterward in the Canons of 1640 <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row <hi>Col.</hi> p. 235.</note>, when it behov'd the Clergy to tread warily, and to prevent all manner of Exceptions. And yet There again, the very same <hi>English</hi> Inscription returns; nor did that House of Commons, which was no ways unwilling to find fault with any thing in these Canons that could be laid hold of, except against this Title, but made use of it themselves in their Votes <note n="‖" place="margin">Rush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth <hi>part</hi> 3. p. 1365.</note> of <hi>Dec.</hi> 1.5, 16, [1640] without questioning the <hi>Accuracy,</hi> or <hi>Legality</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="394" facs="tcp:48421:226"/>From all which I inferr, that those very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations that took out these <hi>Commissions,</hi> did not however think that they <hi>treated in vertue</hi> of them, and much less that they <hi>could not</hi> have treated <hi>without</hi> them. They needed such Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, only to draw up and pass their Synodal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees in form; and though more was inserted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, even the Liberty of <hi>Debating,</hi> as well as <hi>Concluding</hi>; yet they accepted what <hi>was not</hi> necessary, for the sake of what <hi>was</hi>: taking care only in the Front of their Synodical Acts, to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sert a Liberty of Debate to themselves, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendently of any such Royal Grants or Commis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions. All they wanted was a Commission to <hi>make</hi> or <hi>decree</hi> Canons; the <hi>Attorney General</hi> who had the drawing it, thought, it seems, that it would not harm them, if a little more than they wanted was given them; and knew, to be sure, that he should not hurt his Master's Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative by it: and so, that the Royal Grant, and the Clergys Priviledge might look Ample and Full enough, was pleas'd, as has been usual in such cases, to multiply Words without Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion: But it no more follows from the Clergys admitting such a License, that they needed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Part and Parcel of it, than it does, that a Criminal, who takes out a <hi>General Pardon,</hi> is guilty of every Individual Crime that is there specify'd.

The Powers here granted are much the same, and in much the same words with those in the Commission to the Convocation: but no body can be silly enough to think that Private Persons might not of their own Accord have done all this, have enter'd into such Considerations, and made such Proposals to the King, without a Commission. Commissions are oft-times employ'd, not for the security of such as do the Business, but to secure its being done; they give the Countenance of Authority to Things, and promote the Dispatch of them.

Now though I doubt not but that <hi>William de Perecat</hi> went about his Business more nimbly, and to better effect, after this Message than be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it; yet I cannot forbear thinking, that if these Clergymen and He had been agreed, he might have exercised his Office upon them, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having a <hi>Writ</hi> to shew for it. This is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Instance indeed, but may be as Instructive as a more solemn one; and if it serve withal to relieve a serious Scene, and make the Reader smile a little, I have my double end in it.</p>
               <p>What has been said, may be sufficient, I hope, to account for the License of 1603. and for any Word or Passage in it, that may be suppos'd to affect the Clergys <hi>Liberty of Debate,</hi> which they were in an Unterrupted Possession of when that Practise first began, and have an Undoubted Right to still, notwithstanding the continuance of it.</p>
               <p>One Expression indeed there is in it, which Dr. <hi>W.</hi> catches at, and has not been yet consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd. He observes, that the Liberty granted by that Commission is said to proceed, out of the King's <hi>Especial Grace, Certain Knowledge, and Mere Motion</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 116.</note>; and does most invincibly from thence argue that it could not therefore be their <hi>Due,</hi> or belong to them <hi>ex debito justitiae</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 290. (283.)</note>. I agree with him thus far, that a <hi>Commission</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powering them to <hi>Treat</hi> is not their <hi>Due,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:48421:228"/>
I take it to be their unquestion'd <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Due</hi> to treat without one. But his Reason why they are not entitled to it of <hi>Right,</hi> I can by no means admit; because Learned Lawyers tell me, that those Phrases <hi>Especial Grace, and Mere Motion</hi> are used sometimes for forms sake, where the thing said to be thus granted is strict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>Right,</hi> and cannot be with Justice deny'd. For Instance, the Writ <hi>de Excommunicato capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endo,</hi> upon a Certification into Chancery, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, we know, in course, and <hi>de Iure Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nario</hi>; and is therefore, in diverse Precedents of it, said to issue <hi>secundùm Consuetudinem Angliae,</hi> i. e. according to the common Law of <hi>England</hi>; and yet in one Instance, Dr. <hi>Cousin</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Apol. for Proc. Eccl.</hi> p. 8.</note> informs me, that it runs <hi>quòd hujusmodi breve nostrum de Gratià nostra procedat</hi>; and a Note therefore in the Register, upon these words in another Writ, says, that they are us'd only <hi>pro Honore Regio, etiamsi ad id de Iure teneatur.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I pay too great a Regard to his trifling Remarks, in pursuing them thus minutely; and go on therefore to remove the rest of the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions taken at our way of expounding the Statute.</p>
               <p>In my account of the <hi>Practise</hi> of Convocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons since the 25 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. I slipp'd over some <hi>Requests of the Lower House of Convocation to the Upper,</hi> a few years after this Act pass'd, and promis'd to make a distinct Head of them; which I shall now therefore consider and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain.</p>
               <p>It is objected against that sense I have given of the Statute that the Clergy of those times did themselves understand it otherwise; for in a
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:48421:228"/>
                  <hi>Petition</hi> put up by them to the Bishops 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 
                  <hi>E.</hi> VI. they recite some part of the Submission-Act, and of the 27 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. that confirms it; and then <q>desire, that being presently assembled in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation by auctority of the King's Writ, the King's Majestys License in Writing may for them be obtain'd and granted, according to the Effect of the said Statues; auctorising them to attempt, entreat, and commune of such matters, and therein freely to give their Consents, which otherwise they may not do upon Pain and Peril premis'd.</q>
This indeed seems <hi>Material,</hi> and for this Reason, I suppose, Dr. <hi>W.</hi> takes no notice of it. But <hi>L. M. P.</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists upon it, and styles it <hi>an Authentick Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that statute, which without any other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence is sufficient to shew, that it was the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of that Act, that the Treating and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solving, as well as the Meeting of a Convocation should depend upon the Mere Good-will of the Prince</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Pp. 39, 40</note>. The Reader may observe, how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous kind this Gentleman can be to the Clergy upon occasion, and what a profound respect he has for their Opinion, when it is for his Turn. He allows a Petition of the Lower House of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, to be <hi>an Authentick Exposition</hi> of an Act of Parliament; an Honor, which the most solemn Decisions of both Houses would not (much less do the Petitions and Requests of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one) deserve; and least of all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Requests we are at present concerned with. For,</p>
               <p>It is probable that the <hi>Petition</hi> it self is not <hi>Authentick,</hi> and then the <hi>Exposition</hi> it gives, to be sure, cannot be so. There are two Papers printed by my Lord of <hi>Sarum</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">2. Vol. Coll <hi>of Rec.</hi> n. 16, 17.</note>, which

                  <hi>E.</hi> VI.) <hi>to the Upper.</hi> The Former of these <note n="†" place="margin">N. 16.</note> is not a single Petition, but four se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Requests (or rather the Minutes of four) joyn'd together; with a certain <hi>Query</hi> annex'd, in the Close of them. Of these the <hi>First</hi> relates to the Collection of Ecclesiastical Laws, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Act of Parliament to be made in <hi>H.</hi> the VIII<hi>th's</hi> time. The <hi>Second</hi> is a Proposal for adjoyning the Lower House of Convocation to that of Parliament. The <hi>Third</hi> concerns the Committee for reforming the Offices. The <hi>Fourth</hi> is about the Statute of First fruits and Tenths. The <hi>Query</hi> added is,
<q>Whether the Clergy of the Convocation may liberally speak their mind, without danger of Statute, or Law?</q>
The Latter is a Petition in form, from the Low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Clergy to the Bishops, enforcing the second of those Requests put up in the former Paper, and praying a <hi>License in Writing,</hi> in the Terms already recited <note n="†" place="margin">P. 399.</note>. Now this last Paper, I say, seems never to have been approv'd, or presented, by the Lower Clergy; and I say it, upon these Grounds.</p>

That<q> the Act [which repeal'd the Statute of the six Articles] was occasion'd by a Speech that Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi> had in Convocation, in which he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted the Clergy to give themselves much to the study of Scripture, and to consider serious<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what needed Reformation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon which some intimated to him, that as long as these Six Articles stood in force, it was not safe for them to deliver their Opinions.

the First step, which the Convocation, after they sat down, would have taken: whereas we find by the Petition it self, that it could not be drawn up, till the Session had continu'd some time; for the first Clause of it mentions a former Suit of theirs made to the Bishops, in order to be by Them promoted with the King; of which the Clergy had hitherto been expecting some Account from their Lordships, without receiving any.

               <p>My Lord of <hi>Sarum</hi> therefore not informing us, whether the Paper from whence he transcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed this form was an <hi>Original</hi> (as when it is so, he generally does) I must take leave to suspect that it was not; and to apply to it the words, which his Lordship himself uses about a <hi>Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> of an Extraordinary Nature, printed by <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.</hi>
                  <q>If he saw but a <hi>Copy,</hi> we have reason to doubt of it; for that might be only the Essay of some Projecting Man's Pen <note n="†" place="margin">Vol. 2. p. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The present Paper might be, and, it is likely, was no more than the first Draught of a Petition fram'd by some Private Hand, but never agreed to by the Lower Clergy: And (were it allowable
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:48421:231"/>
to guess at his Lordships Thoughts in this case) I should think that He himself had entertain'd some such Opinion concerning it. For though he has Printed this second Petition, together with the <hi>First,</hi> in his <hi>Collection of Records,</hi> yet in his <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>story</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vol.</hi> 2. p. 47.</note> he makes but a very slight mention of it, and gives no Account but of the First only: and yet this Last contains New Matter in it, of great Importance, and which, were the Paper, where it is, Authentick, would very well have deserv'd a place in the Body of his Lordships Work; and could not well have escap'd the Pen of so Discerning a Writer. One would think there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that his Lordship had some secret Suspici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the inauthoritativeness of this second Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, grounded either on a View of the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>script it self, from whence he transcrib'd it, or on some other reasons which his Lordship has not been pleas'd to acquaint us with.</p>
               <p>Indeed Bishop <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> who first produc'd it, seems to say, it was found among Archbishop <hi>Cranmer</hi>'s Papers: which looks as if it had been lodg'd in his hands as President of the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and consequently were not a mere <hi>Dra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>
                  </hi> only, but agreed to, and presented by the Lower House. For which reason, notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Probabilitys there are to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, I will suppose it Authentick; and if it were so, have this further to say to it: That if we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this Petition to have been actually offer'd, yet it is certain that it had not its Effect, and that no License in Writing issu'd upon it. For if it had, we should never have heard of any such <hi>Memorandum</hi> in the Acts, as that I just now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd. It is manifest that at the Time of the Date of this <hi>Memorandum,</hi> the Clergy were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  <hi>Licens'd:</hi> for they could not then have needed an Indemnity to treat in particular cases; since the General Powers contain'd in that License would have been to all Intents and Purposes their Warrant and Security. And if they had not a Commission in five Weeks from the time of their Meeting, it will be easily granted me, that they had none afterwards. Indeed for the same Reason that this <hi>Memorandum</hi> proves, that the Clergy had no License now, it proves also that they were to have none: for had they not laid aside all Thoughts of a General License, they would never have ask'd for a Particular one, to indemnify them in some special Cases. On the very day when they pray'd this Indemnity, the Acts say also <note n="†" place="margin">Isto die communi con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensu nominati &amp; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note>, that they appointed some Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of their own to sollicit their Conjunction with the Commons; which was plainly in conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the first Branch of their Petition, intimating a Design of appointing such Sollicitors. But as to the Second Clause relating to the 25 <hi>H</hi> VIII. and a General License, they now take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of it; but instead of it, desire only to be Indemnify'd from the six Articles. Which is a manifest sign, that they had now drop'd this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest, if they ever made it.</p>
               <p>The Petition therefore, if put up in form, was most certainly quash'd above, by the Bishops, satisfying the Clergy, upon Advice had in the case, that such a Commission was needless. So that nothing can be more to the Advantage of the Clergys Freedom of Debate, than this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:48421:232"/>
supposing it Authentick. For as the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring it shews that the Clergy doubted at first whether a Commission might not be necessary to enable them to <hi>attempt, entreat, and commune,</hi> &amp;c. so their acting without such a Commission afterwards (for act they did) is a clear Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that those Doubts were overrul'd as soon as started, and does in effect amount to a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the Point in question.

               <p>But had we been in the dark as to the Event of this Petition, yet the very Time and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances in which it was fram'd would sufficiently have accounted for it, and shew'd us the Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonableness of setting up this Instance as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent. The Nation was then in an high Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the Popish Party both in the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and out of it, strong; and, to be sure, watchful to make use of all Advantages against the Reforming Clergy: in whom therefore it might be prudent to arm themselves for the Great Work they were going about (a thourough Alteration of the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church) with the Largest Powers they could procure, whether in strictness of Law they need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, or not.

               <p>We see here what a profound Submission was in those times pay'd to the Prerogative, in the Point of Liberty of Debate, even by Parliaments themselves; and have with all a clear Proof, that Men may <hi>Petition</hi> for what is unquestion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably their <hi>Right</hi>; and (which is more) may continue so to do for long Periods of time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prejudicing their Right by such repeated Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions. Which however is far from being the case in respect of the Clergy: for I have shewn it doubtful, whether the Petition alledg'd were ever presented; or, if it were, yet certain that it was overrul'd afterwards, no License issuing upon it; and that the Clergy neither had, nor thought they needed any such License for some succeeding Reigns. So that (to return to what led me into these Enquirys) no <hi>Authentick Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position</hi> of the Submission-Act is to be had either from this <hi>Petition</hi> as <hi>L. M.

Of these the first and last Positions are easily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; but I desire to be excus'd from believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the second, as it is now worded, was of Dr. <hi>Cousins</hi>'s drawing; since it contradicts the Practise of the Synods held under <hi>Parker,</hi> and <hi>Grindall,</hi> and his own Patron Archbishop <hi>Whitgift</hi>; and as far as we can learn, that of the Convocation in 1597, the Year before <hi>Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sins</hi> dy'd. The Tables therefore being not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd till after his Death, and after the Synod in 1603, 'tis reasonable to believe, that they had the General Fate of Posthumous Pieces, not to come out exactly as their Author left them; and particularly that they were, in the second Position, adjusted to the Practise of the Synod in 1603, either by the Editor, or by the owner of that Copy from whence the Edition

               <p>But to resume our Argument,—
<q>We are told further, that K. <hi>Iames</hi> the I. in his Declaration prefix'd to the XXXIX Articles, and publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with them, doth declare, That he is Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Governor of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; and that if any difference arise about the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:48421:237"/>
Policy, concerning Injunctions, Canons, or other Constitutions, the Clergy in their Convocations is to order and settle them, <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving first obtain'd Leave under our Broad-Seal</hi> so to do <note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>L. M. P.</hi> p. 41.</note>.</q>
If King <hi>Iames</hi> declar'd this, he declar'd it some Years after he was in his Grave; for the Declaration meant came not out till 1628. But let the Doctrine be whose it will, it is very good; Leave under the Broad-Seal, it is confess'd, must be had, to <hi>order and settle</hi> any difference arising about Old Canons and Constitutions, for that is in effect to make New ones: but for any other Acts previous to this <hi>Ordering and Setling,</hi> such a Leave is not neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, nor does the Declaration say it is; though there are some words that look a little more this way, than any of those produc'd by this wise arguer; for it follows,—
<q>Out of our Princely Care that Church-men may do the Work which is proper for them, the Bishops and Clergy from time to time in Convocation, upon their hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble desire, shall have a License under our Broad-Seal <hi>to deliberate of, and to do</hi> all such things as being made plain by them, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto by Us, shall concern the setled continuance of the Doctrine and Discipline of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Establish'd, from whence we will not endure any Variance, or Departing in the least Degree.</q>
This latter Clause must be explain'd by the former, where the Doctrine in this point is professedly sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ed; and there a Leave only <hi>to order and settle</hi> is made necessary. Besides even here <hi>Deliberating</hi>
is not to be separated from <hi>Doing</hi>; nor a Leave suppos'd requisite for the one, but as it is to end in the other. This is a Form of Expression
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:48421:238"/>
founded on the License practis'd in 1603, which I have already accounted for.</p>
               <p>And now nothing I think that carrys the Face of an Objection has escap'd me, unless it be a small Remark made by Dr. <hi>W.</hi> on the Form of the Convocation-writ; wherein the King, he says, <hi>reserves to himself the Priviledge of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Subject, which they are to Deliberate and Resolve upon</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 111.</note>. 'Tis true, in another place he tells us, with his usual Consistency, that he does not found his Opinion of the Necessity of a License upon the Form of this Writ <note n="†" place="margin">P. 287.</note>: howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver even there he affirms this Writ <hi>plainly to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that some such License is to be expected from the King</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 287.</note>; and though therefore his Opinion be not <hi>founded</hi> on the Writ, yet he thinks it is migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily strengthned, and countenanc'd by it. But this is a Construction that no man living could have made of it, that had a true Understanding either of the Writ it self, or of the Times where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it was fram'd. His account of the Writ runs thus—
<q>In the beginning of it (says he) the King having mention'd <hi>by way of form,</hi> that for certain urgent Affairs of great Concern both to the Church and Kingdom, he had commanded the Archbishop to summon the Clergy to come together to such a certain place, and at such a certain time; he thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares what they were to do, when met: Name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they were to Treat, Consent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude upon the Premisses, and such Other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which should be more clearly declar'd to them, when they came together, on the King's behalf.</q>
From hence he reasons in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,—that though <q>the Urgent Affairs of the King, Church, and Realm, which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:48421:238"/>
is <hi>in General</hi> to debate about, be the constant Introduction of every Convocation-Writ, yet this is <hi>by way of form</hi> only: for the King still reserves to himself to declare to them, and they are, when met, to expect his special Direction, and not ramble after their own fancys, or any matter within this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Compass without his Warrant <note n="*" place="margin">Pp. 111.112.</note>.</q>
But how false and forc'd these Colours are, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear if we consider,</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Writs which summon the Barons to Parliament, have much the same Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, with this for a Convocation; these also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with a [<hi>Quibusdam arduis &amp; urgenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus negotiis,</hi> &amp;c.] as this does; and proceeding to other Expressions, the same in sense with the subsequent Words in the Convocation-Writ; and in this only differing from them that they are not quite so Expressive and Forcible. Now Dr. <hi>W.</hi> will not, I hope, dare to say, that those Words are plac'd also in the Lord's Writs <hi>by way of form</hi> only: and if not, how come they to be us'd more by way of form Here than There? Nay,</p>
               <p n="2">2. These words are so far from being plac'd in the <hi>Front</hi> of the Convocation-Writ by way of Form only, that they are expresly referr'd to in the <hi>Body</hi> of it; where the Clergy are said to assemble <hi>ad tractandum, consentiendum, &amp; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

They went in near the same Terms that they do now, 200 Years before the Submission-Act pass'd, when the King's Power of confining the Clergy to deliberate on nothing but what he offer'd to them, was a Doctrine never dream of. And I hope, since the Words of the Writ are the same Now as they were Then, the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them must be the same too: for though the 25 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. abridg'd the Convocations Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges in several respects, yet it could not make the Words of their Writ signify otherwise than they did, when they were first inserted.

And these therefore are said to come <hi>ex parte domini Regis,</hi> every where throughout the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops Registers. Dr. <hi>W.</hi> cannot be ignorant e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to think that the Clergy had Then no Power of entring on any Deliberations ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept what those Honourable Messengers recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prohibitions</hi> were at that time usual, sent sometimes in Writing, and sometimes denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced <hi>Viva Voce</hi> by the Judges, who came along with the Great Men that brought the King's Message. By These the Clergy were forbid to treat of any thing wherein the King's Crown and Dignity was concern'd; which implys them at Liberty to treat of every thing in which they were not thus prohibited. Their Debates in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed were bounded by the Nature and Ends of the Assembly it self; which confined them to
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:48421:240"/>
Matters properly of Ecclesiastical Cognizance, and such as related to their Own Order, and did no ways entrench on the King's Prerogative, and on the Laws of the Realm. But in all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther respects, the Debates and Proceedings of Convocation were then under as little restraint as those of Parliament.</p>
               <p>The <hi>form of the Convocation-Writ</hi> therefore is of no manner of service to Dr. <hi>W.</hi> and had been better let alone by him than produced; as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all his Learning of this kind had; in which he is very Improper and Unlucky, for he scarce ever medles with a <hi>Writ,</hi> without giving the Reader some occasion or other to pitty his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, before he has done with it. This (having secur'd the Two Points laid down at the En-I trance of these Sheets against all Exceptions) I am now at Leysure to make out upon him; and, by briefly running over what there is in his Book of this, or the like nature, to shew, how unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd a Man he was to meddle in the present Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, and how utterly a stranger he is to all that Knowledge that is requisite to frame a True Judgment upon it. This shall be the Business of the Next and Last Chapter; which I shall draw into as narrow a Compass as conveniently I can, having already, I fear, expatiated a little too much in the Others.</p>

               <head>CHAP. IX.</head>
               <p>DR. <hi>Wake</hi> has grac'd his <hi>Appendix</hi> with the Forms of several Writs; the First <note n="†" place="margin">P. 359.</note> of which is, he says, an <hi>Antient Writ of Summons</hi> for an <hi>Abbat,</hi> and the second, for a <hi>Bishop</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 361.</note>, to come to Parliament. It seems, this Great An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary thinks that Bishops and Abbats were call'd to Parliament by Writs of a different form: whereas every one that is in the least acquainted with things of this nature knows, that whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the Abbats had an <hi>Immediate and Personal</hi> Summons, their Writs ran in the very same Terms with those of the Bishops, the Clause <hi>Premunientes</hi> only excepted; and are therefore very seldom recited at length in the Rolls of Parliament, but entred onely with an <hi>Eodem mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do mandatum est,</hi> or <hi>Consimiles Literae diriguntur Abbatibus &amp; Prioribus subscriptis.</hi> But had he a mind for the Honour of the <hi>Abbats,</hi> whose or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is now extinct, to record <hi>Their</hi> Writ of Summons <hi>distinctly</hi> in his Immortal Work, and by that means to preserve the Memory of it to future Ages, yet that he should single out that particular Writ he has printed, as an <hi>Antient</hi> one, and of the Reign of <hi>H.</hi> III. <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> p. 359.</note> is a little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy; when it is certain that That Writ in all its forms never went out till the Middle or Lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter End of <hi>R.</hi> II. <hi>i. e.</hi> till about an 120 Years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>H.</hi> the III. was dead and buried. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory words [<hi>Quia de avisamento consilii nostri</hi>] are scarce found in any Parliament-Writ before 12 <hi>E.</hi> III. when they are two or three times us'd, and not afterwards till the 46 <hi>E.</hi> III.
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:48421:241"/>
when they begin to be employ'd pretty constantly. The <hi>Defence of the Church of England,</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd in the Close of it, never had place in any Writ till 6 <hi>E.</hi> II. (says <hi>Pryn</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. W. Vol. 1. p. 115.</note>); was never <hi>ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily</hi> inserted, till the 49 <hi>E.</hi> III. and never in that manner in which it is express'd in this Writ, till towards the End of <hi>Richard</hi> the II's Reign. At which time, and so on downwards the Precise Form (Printed by Dr. <hi>W.</hi> for an <hi>Antient</hi> Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in the Time of <hi>H.</hi> the III.) with little or no difference, regularly obtain'd. However Dr. <hi>W</hi>'s Writ cannot be yet so Old as <hi>R.</hi> II. for it begins with <hi>Henricus dei gratiâ,</hi> &amp;c. and must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long therefore to One of the Three <hi>Harry</hi>'s that immediately succeeded him. Impossible there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is, that the Abbot of <hi>Tavestoke</hi> should e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be summon'd by this Writ, as he tells us <note n="†" place="margin">P. 360.361.</note> he was; since that Abbat was never call'd to Parliament after the 23 <hi>E.</hi> III. <note n="*" place="margin">

               <p>Dr. <hi>W.</hi> will perhaps lay the blame of all these Faults on <hi>Reynerius</hi>'s <hi>Apostolatus Benedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctinus,</hi> which he quotes there. But can it be any Excuse for him, who had so many near Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stick Helps towards clearing up these Mistakes, that One who wrote at a distance from all our Records has mistaken before him? However, even <hi>Reynerius</hi> himself, as much at a distance as he wrote, was better instructed than this comes to; for neither does he produce this as the Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of an <hi>Abbat, distinct</hi> from that of a <hi>Bishop</hi>; nor as an <hi>Old</hi> one, much less as of the Time of <hi>H.</hi> III: nor does he say, that the List of Abbats given by Dr. <hi>W.</hi> were by this Writ ever Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd. These are all Dr. <hi>Wakes</hi> new Lights, and Peculiar Improvements.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="425" facs="tcp:48421:241"/>After all, if he thought a Writ of Summons to an <hi>Abbat</hi> would look well in his <hi>Appendix,</hi> how came that in the Annals of <hi>Burton</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 371.</note> to be overlook'd; which is really of the age he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends that the other is, and one of the most An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Writs extant, being sent out in the 41 <hi>H.</hi> III. <hi>Ao.</hi> 1256?</p>
               <p>In the next Number we meet with an <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent</hi> Writ of Summons of a <hi>Bishop</hi> to Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note n="†" place="margin">P. 361.</note>. And here again, Dr. <hi>W.</hi> can rise no higher than the 49 <hi>H.</hi> III. whereas we have a Writ of this kind 6<hi rend="sup">to</hi> 
                  <hi>Ioh.</hi> i. e. 60 Years Older than this; and two others of the 26 and 38. <hi>H.</hi> III. still preserv'd in our Records, and not in our Records only, but in the Printed Pieces of <hi>Sel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, Pryn,</hi> and <hi>Brady:</hi> so that they can be a secret to none but those to whom every thing almost of this kind is so.</p>
               <p>After the Abbats Antient Summons, he sets down a List of 24 <hi>Abbats</hi> and one <hi>Prior</hi> anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently Summon'd; believing this to be the fix'd number of them, whereas it frequently varied. In the 49 <hi>H.</hi> III. by that very Writ he Prints, no less than 102 Abbats and Priors were Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd; which <hi>Dugdale</hi> would have told him, had he transcrib'd that Writ out of Him, and not out of a Faulty Edition of <hi>Elsyng.</hi> I sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose he took it from thence, because I find the same Error there that I do in Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cript; <hi>pro pace regni assensurandà,</hi> instead of <hi>assecurandâ:</hi> which in <hi>Elsyng</hi> is only a Mistake of the Printer, but Dr. <hi>W.</hi> took it for an Old Term of Art, and was nicely careful therefore to preserve the Spelling. In <hi>Edward</hi> the I. and II's times, 50, 60, 70. and sometimes 80 Abbots and upwards <note n="†" place="margin">28 <hi>E.</hi> I. <hi>Cl.</hi> m. 3. <hi>dors.</hi>
                  </note> were Summon'd; that the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:48421:242"/>
of the <hi>Regulars</hi> might be in some degree an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swerable to that of the <hi>Seculars,</hi> call'd up by the <hi>Premunientes,</hi> and the Parliament be a <hi>Full</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentative both of the Clergy and Laiety. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the middle of <hi>E.</hi> II. when the Clergy got ground upon the Crown, the Number of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd Abbats decreas'd mightily, and was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally a few under, or above thirty, throughout <hi>Edward</hi> the III's Reign: when Convocations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now held a course concurrently with Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all the Abbats and Priors of note came up thither, upon the Archbishop's Mandate; and were there ready to receive the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands: and were excus'd therefore from the Parliamentary Writ, which was sent out only to such Abbats and Priors as held by Barony. Afterwards <hi>from the Reign of</hi> E. III. <hi>to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, their number always exceeded twenty, and fell short of thirty,</hi> says one excellently ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed in these Enquirings: whose Observation however is not Universally true; for the 12 <hi>H.</hi> VI. <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale <hi>Sum.</hi> p. 424.</note> and 31 <hi>H.</hi> VIII. <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> p. 501.</note> are Exceptions to it; in both which Instances the Number of Abbats call'd fell short of twenty. This Inequality in the Latter Reigns seems to have sprung chiefly from the Vacancy of Abbys, or the Absence of Abbats, who were abroad either upon Embassys, or at General Councils; and had not in this case (as the Bishops had) their <hi>Vicars general,</hi> to whom the Crown directed Writs in their stead.</p>
               <p>Nor Mistakes he only in the <hi>Numbers,</hi> but in the <hi>Titles</hi> also of these Abbats; for some that are not in his List (particularly the Abbats of <hi>Waltham-Cross,</hi> and <hi>Cirencester</hi>) were from the 49 <hi>H.</hi> III. downward, as constantly Summon'd as almost any of the twenty four he has set
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:48421:242"/>
down; and the Prior of <hi>S. Iohn</hi>'s of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> much oftner than the Prior of <hi>Coventry,</hi> whom alone he has mention'd.</p>
               <p>The next thing we meet with is a Bishop's Summons of the 23 <hi>E.</hi> I. <note n="†" place="margin">P. 363.</note> which is given us by the Dr. as the first Writ of the kind by which the Inferior Clergy were warn'd to Parliament <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> p. 212.</note>, where as I have shewn that it went out in the 22 <hi>E.</hi> I. if not earlier; and have brought Vou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers for this, not from musty Manuscripts on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, which are below the Dr's care, but even from his Old Friends and Acquaintants, our Printed Historians. And Methinks a Man so Historically inclin'd as He is, might have known what <hi>Knighton,</hi> and the Annals of <hi>Worcester</hi> say on this occasion.</p>
               <p>But to let this Error pass, as a common one; yet in his next Article, where he pretends to compare the Clause <hi>Premunientes as it was set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> 15 E. II. <hi>with the same as it is now</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 365.</note>, his Mistakes are unpardonable. For whereas he tells us, that this Clause was <hi>setled</hi> 15 E. II. it is true neither ways; since long before this it was setled as much as now; going out in the same Terms often in the Latter End of <hi>E.</hi> the I. and beginning of <hi>E.</hi> II: And long after his 15<hi>th.</hi> Year it receiv'd an Alteration that has by some been thought Material; for the Words <hi>ad faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>endum &amp; consentiendum</hi> were not constantly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd, but turn'd sometimes into <hi>ad consentien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum,</hi> even in <hi>E.</hi> the III's Reign; and never, that I can find, us'd after 5 <hi>R.</hi> II. from which Time to Ours the Writ has ran <hi>ad cònsentiendum</hi> only. The Clause <hi>Premunientes</hi> therefore was not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>setled</hi> till threescore years after 15 <hi>E.</hi> II. But that is not all; for neither in the 15 <hi>E.</hi> II. it
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:48421:243"/>
self, was it so setled as Dr. <hi>W.</hi> represents it to have been, who makes it to premonish <hi>Priorem &amp; Capellanum, Ecclesiae,</hi> instead of <hi>Capitulum</hi>; and repeats this senceless Mistake no less than thrice in the Compass of this short Clause; to shew us that it was not the Error of his Pen, but the Effect of pure Ignorance. It seems, he found it thus set down in an III Edition of the <hi>Abridgment of Records</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 2.</note>; and the Errors of that Book too are all sacred with him. Dr. <hi>W</hi>'s Enemies, as meanly as they may think of his Abilitys in these sort of studys, must yet allow him to have One good Property of an Antiqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for he copys every thing with great nicety, and religiously transcribes even the Verbal Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stakes of those Authors he deals with. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Other Alterations he is for, You shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver find him venturing to alter a faulty Text: for as he knows no Truth, that is not in Print; so he takes every thing for true, that is.</p>
               <p>The same Evidences of his Skill meet us in every Article; for again, <hi>Num.</hi> III. we have him following such another Blind Guide, into a Mistake as gross every whit, as the former For he recites that part of the Old Convocation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> writ, where the Constituent Members are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd up, after this manner—<hi>Universos &amp; sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulos Episcopos vestrae Provinciae, ac Decanos &amp;</hi> Praecentores Ecclesiarum Cathedralium, <hi>Abbates,</hi> &amp;c. Any Man that had ever read Two of these Writs must have known, that <hi>Praecentores</hi> here should be <hi>Priores</hi>; and without having seen a second Writ, might by dint of Common Sense have smelt out so plain an Error as this: but Dr. <hi>Wake</hi> found the word thus in <hi>Fuller</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ch. Hist.</hi> XVI. <hi>Cent.</hi> V. <hi>Book</hi> p. 190.</note>, and took it as he found it; without rasing any Scruples
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:48421:243"/>
to himself, which it was not in his power to lay.</p>
               <p>After all, when Dr. <hi>W.</hi> makes these <hi>Praecen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tores Ecclesiarum Cathedralium</hi> to have place in Convocation, he speaks a greater Truth than he is aware of. For there are a Few Instances on Record, when they were really call'd up thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with the rest of the Cathedral Dignita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the <hi>Chancelors, Treasurers,</hi> and <hi>Capitular Archdeacons.</hi> Thus the Case was twice under <hi>Edward</hi> the III. in his 25<hi>th.</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>See Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gist.</hi> Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelsey f. 142.</note> and 29<hi>th.</hi>

                     <hi>Ibid.</hi> f. 147.</note> Years, when the Exigences of the Church requir'd that the Clergys Assemblys should be Numerous and Full; and when it was in the Archbishops Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er (as it Then was) to summon whom he pleas'd to the Convocation, in like manner as the King could to the Parliament.</p>
               <p>These small matters were not worth insisting on, but to satisfy the Reader how unacquainted Dr. <hi>W.</hi> is with the Forms of all sorts of Writs, either for the Convocation, or Parliament, <hi>i. e.</hi> indeed with the first Elements and Grounds of this Controversy; which can never be rightly understood, or stated, without an Exact know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Nature and Kinds of these Writs, and the several Alterations they under went in different Ages. For Dr. <hi>W.</hi> has rightly observ'd, that <hi>at first these Summons were very properly drawn, and do mark out to us the Undoubted Rights of those to whom they were sent, as they were allow'd of in those Antient Times</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 214.</note>, which holds not only of the first <hi>Draught,</hi> but of the several <hi>Changes</hi> made in them afterwards. And if so, it is very wonderful that our Author, when he was about to state the Rights and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the Clergy in Convocations and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:48421:244"/>
should not above all things have studied and compar'd these Forms, and endeavor'd to give us an Exact and Particular Account of them. A few Observations of this kind, drawn from our Manuscript Registers, would have been of more use towards setling the Point in Debate, than Volumns of such Common Trash as he has produc'd out of our Printed Historians. It has been my care in several parts of this Answer to make up this Defect of Dr. <hi>Wakes,</hi> as far as the Old Collections I had made, and the few New Opportunities I have had of improving my knowledge this way, would allow of. Had the Way to these Records been as open and easy to me as it was to Dr. <hi>W.</hi> I would have endeavor'd that nothing should have been wanting on this argument.</p>
               <p>The Mistakes I have hitherto laid open in this Chapter, belong only to the Three First Articles in Dr. <hi>W</hi>'s <hi>Appendix:</hi> of the Four remaining ones, the Last has been examin'd throughly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; and upon enquiry we have found, that from the beginning to the end, there is scarce a true Line in it. The same thing I have assur'd <note n="†" place="margin">P. 355.</note> the Reader concerning the VI. also, though I wav'd the Proof of it, because it would be Tedious: but if Dr. <hi>W.</hi> demands it, it shall be forthcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The IV<hi>th.</hi> and V<hi>th.</hi> are barely Copys of the <hi>Submission-Act,</hi> and of K. <hi>Charles Commission</hi> to the Convocation in 1640; in which there was no room for <hi>Ignorance</hi> to shew it self, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Mistakes he has there made must be <hi>willful</hi> ones. And willful ones therefore he has made, giving us such deceitful Transcripts <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>As I have shewn</hi> p. 85. <hi>in the Margin, and</hi> p. 96.</note> of Both these Records, as omit some of the most Material Parts of them. In short then, among
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:48421:244"/>
these several Vouchers, which Dr. <hi>W.</hi> has brought to credit his Work, there is not one that does not some way or other blemish it, and betray in him a manifest want of Skill at least, if not of a much better Quality: And the whole <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix</hi> therefore is throughout of a Piece with it self, and with the Book it belongs to.</p>
               <p>Here his Mistakes lay collected to our Hand; but there are many more to the same purpose scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd through his Book; which should be brought together and represented in One View to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

               <p>We have seen already how the Dr. out of his <hi>Especial Grace and Mere Motion</hi> has Summon'd the <hi>Praecentors</hi> of Cathedral Churches to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation: which was very Obliging to <hi>Them</hi>; but not very kind to the <hi>Priors,</hi> whom he left out, to make room for them. He is as Liberal of his Favors to the Lower Clergy too, for he tells us, that the Convocation-Writ calls <hi>two of every Archdeaconry</hi> to the Synod;<note place="margin">P. 104.</note> and the Clause <hi>Premunientes,</hi> as many out of every <hi>Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conry</hi> to Parliament <note n="†" place="margin">P. 150.</note>. His Own Writs in the <hi>Appendix,</hi> if he had read them, would have prevented this mistake, and have told him (what one would think a man should scarce need being told) that there come but two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors from the Clergy of any One Diocese (for Instance, that of <hi>London</hi>) though there happen to be never so many Archdeaconrys in it.

                  <hi>P.</hi> 104. He makes it a doubt, whether the setled number of the Inferior Clergy, call'd by the Bishops Writ, was deriv'd from thence into the Convocation-Writ, or from the Convocation-Writs into those of Parliament: which is, in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, to doubt, whether the Deans, Archdeacons, Capitular and Rural Proctors were call'd to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:48421:246"/>
before the Bishops Writ had that Clause in it. And he who doubts of this, puts it beyond a Doubt, how far He is qualify'd to write on this subject.</p>
               <p>The 49<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> the III. is not more famous for sheathing the Old Barons Swords, than for Exercising the Pens of our Modern Writers. Much has been said of it in relation to the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Interest</hi> of the Commons Temporal; Dr. <hi>W.</hi> seems to make it the <hi>Aera</hi> of that of the Commons Spiritual too; for thus he speaks of it.
<q>Whereas before the 49<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> III. only the Bishops and Abbots, who held of the King by their Baronys were wont to be summon'd to Parliament; in that Year, when the Commons <hi>began</hi> to be call'd, several of the <hi>Inferior Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy</hi> were also call'd together with them; and that, for ought appears, in a larger Proportion than the Laity themselves were <note n="†" place="margin">P. 209.</note>.</q>
Here are two Assertions, in the last of which he is kinder to his Function than will consist with Truth, and in the First not so just as he ought to be. For long before the 49<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> III. not <hi>Bishops and Abbots</hi> only, but (I hope) some <hi>Priors</hi> too, were call'd to Parliament. We will suppose him to have comprehended These, under <hi>Abbats</hi>; yet even thus his account is very defective. For not those Abbats and Barons <hi>only, who held by Barony,</hi> were call'd, but many more than these; and oftentimes the whole Order. The first Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary Summons left <note n="†" place="margin">6. <hi>Ioh.</hi>
                  </note> calls all the Abbats and Priors of the Diocese together with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop of it: and the <hi>Priores Installati, &amp; plenum sub se Conventum habentes,</hi> are (I have shewn already) several times mention'd by <hi>Paris,</hi> as having a General Call to Parliament. Who
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:48421:247"/>
speaks also not seldom of the <hi>Decani, Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaconi,</hi>

                  <hi>&amp; aliae Ecclesiasticae Personae</hi> as present. Dr. <hi>W.</hi> who would be thought to know All our Historians so intimately, should methinks have had some sort of acquaintance with the best of them, <hi>M. Paris</hi>: at least he should not, till he had read him, have ventur'd to determin any thing concerning the Constituent Members of the Great Councils in <hi>H.</hi> the III's time, of which we have no where so just an account as in that accurate Writer.
But he makes his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der amends in what follows: for <q>in the 49<hi>th. H.</hi> III. (it seems) when the <hi>Commons</hi> began to be call'd, several of the <hi>Inferior Clergy</hi> were also call'd together with them, and that, for ought appears, in a Larger Proportion than the Laity themselves were.</q>
Were they so? How came then our Historys and Records not to have mention'd it? From none of which can it be certainly learnt, that there were any of the Clergy call'd to this Meeting, below Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats and Priors, but five <hi>Deans</hi> only. It may be, many of Inferior Rank might be summon'd too: but if they were, 'tis more than can be prov'd; for there is not, I believe, the least Hint of such a Summons remaining: sure we are, that they could not be call'd up in the same way that was afterwards practis'd, for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops Writ of that Year is on record, and has no Warning Clause in it. But it may be, the <hi>Abbats, Priors,</hi> (and <hi>Deans</hi>) that held not by <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rony,</hi> are Dr. <hi>W.</hi>'s <hi>Inferior Clergy:</hi> let them be so, their Number in this Instance did not amount to above Eighty; whereas the <hi>Knights, Citizens, Burgesses,</hi> and <hi>Barons of the Cinque Ports</hi> must have been four or five times that Number.

Whence he drew this Piece of History therefore, I cannot divine. The Learned Person, <note n="†" place="margin">Dr. <hi>Brady</hi>
                  </note> I am sure, whom he vouches for it, in his Margin, has not a Letter this way, in the Pages cited: but he thought the Reverence Men had for the Character of that most Knowing Antiquary, would have made them take every thing impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly for Truth, to which his Name was set, and have prevented all further Enquirys.</p>

But I think it very improbable, that while they were, strictly speaking, a Member of Parliament, they should meet so far from the Place, where it open'd and sat; as improbable, as that the Commons should have met at the same Distance from the <hi>Lords.

               <p>And the same Distance of Time was often also observ'd both in Proroguing and Dissolving that Princes Convocations and Parliaments.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>Authority</hi> by which the Clergy were conven'd, Dr. <hi>W.</hi> affords us as little light in That Point too as in any of the former. He recites the Opinion of some who think that <hi>after the statute of</hi> Premunire <hi>in</hi> 1393. <hi>our Archbishops left off to summon Convocations by their Own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and call'd them only at the King's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Pp. 240, 241.</note>: but in this account, he says, he is not <hi>altogether satisfied.</hi> Had he any manner of Knowledge of these things, he would not be <hi>at all</hi> satisfy'd with it. For as in Fact it is certain, that the Archbishop after this time sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd Convocations frequently by his Own Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, so it is clear in point of Law, that he had as much Right to do it, after the Statute of <hi>Premunire,</hi> as before it; there being no Clause, or
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:48421:249"/>
Word in that Act, that can be suppos'd to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strain His Power in this particular. Indeed had the Archbishop, whenever he call'd a Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without the King's Writ, done it by a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatin Authority</hi> (as Dr. <hi>W.</hi> represents him to have done <note n="*" place="margin">P. 241, 199.</note>) there would have been some Ground to think that the <hi>Premunire</hi> Act might have laid a Restraint upon him. But this is another of Dr. <hi>W</hi>'s mistakes: for the Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop needed no Help from his <hi>Legatin</hi> Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter to convene the Clergy of his Province; which he was sufficiently impower'd to do as <hi>Metropolitan,</hi> by the Old Canons of the Church, receiv'd and allow'd in this Kingdom. And ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly by this <hi>Metropolitical</hi> Power, the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishops all along call'd <hi>Provincial Councils,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any of them were the Popes <hi>Legates,</hi> which from St. <hi>Austin</hi> down to (<hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obald</hi> say some <note n="*" place="margin">

He indeed, by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of his New Character, summon'd the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop of <hi>York,</hi> and all the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of that Province <note n="⸪" place="margin">Ibid. &amp; Continuator Florentii Wig. ad ann. 1127.</note> to his Councils; and One of his Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sors <note n="‖" place="margin">

And in order to these <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traprovincial</hi> Acts of Jurisdiction, the <hi>Lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> Authority was indeed needful. For tho' it had been solemnly determin'd in favour of <hi>Lanfrank</hi> by the Great Council of the Kingdom <note n="⸫" place="margin">
                     <hi>Diceto</hi> de Archi. Cant. p. 685.</note>, that the See of <hi>York</hi> should be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to that of <hi>Cant.</hi> and the Archbishop of the

One obey the Conciliary summons of the other; yet was not this Decision long observ'd, the Archbishop of <hi>York</hi> soon finding means to get rid of it, and to assert the Independency of his See. But as to the Ordinary Acts of Metropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Power (One of which was the calling of the Clergy of his Province together at Times prescrib'd by the Canons) the Archbishop had no more want of a <hi>Legatine</hi> Character, to qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify him for the Exercise of them, than a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Bishop had (or now has) for summoning a Diocesan Synod; nor was it, as the Law then stood, any more an Encroachment upon the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Authority. Dr. <hi>W.</hi> therefore is not very kind to the Memory of our Archbishops, nor a Friend to the Antient Libertys of this Church, when he asserts, that all those Synods which the Metro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politan call'd without a Writ from the King, were <hi>Legatine</hi>; and upon that notion, dates the Disuse of them (at least as to their frequency) from the Statute of <hi>Premunire,</hi> which did no ways, and could no ways affect them. For af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Statute most of <hi>Arundel</hi>'s Synods met by the Archbishop's Writ only; as Dr. <hi>W.</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 280.</note> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self tells us from <hi>Harpsfield,</hi> and might have told us yet more authentickly from that Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop's Register yet remaining. This account of <hi>Harpsfield</hi> puts him upon fixing on a New <hi>Aera</hi>; and now therefore he will have it, that <hi>about the End of</hi> Arundel's <hi>time the King began wholly to assume</hi> this Power; and this he thinks to be <hi>no Improble Conjecture of</hi> Fuller <hi>our Church-Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storian</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="margin">P. 230.</note>. When the Authority of a Conjecture of <hi>Fuller</hi>'s is appeal'd to, one may be sure that both Authoritys and Reasons run low with him.

Let us ballance the Authority of a Conjecture of One Church Historian with the Records printed by another <note n="†" place="margin">Bishop <hi>Burnet.</hi>
                  </note> at the End of his first Volumn. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst which One of the first that meets us, <note n="†" place="margin">P. 6.</note> is, a Mandate for a Convocation issu'd out by Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bishop <hi>Warsham</hi> in 1509, without the Recital or Mention of any Previous Writ from the King to that purpose. This Instance I have particularly pitch'd upon, because Dr. <hi>W.</hi> has strengthned this Guess of <hi>Fuller</hi>'s by another of his Own; concluding from the Assertion in the Submission-Act, that the Convocation certainly met by the King's Writ <hi>all</hi> H. <hi>the</hi> VIII's <hi>time, and for some considerable time before</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 231.</note>; whereas this Synod in the first Year of that Prince met, as far as appears, by no <hi>Provincial</hi> Summons, but what was from the <hi>Archbishop</hi> only.</p>
               <p>How the Clergy, when met either in Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation or Parliament, consulted, is another Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Part of Knowledge which Dr. <hi>W.</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vors a little, and but a little, to supply us with. Something he says of the Spiritualty sitting and acting separately from the Lay-part of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <note n="†" place="margin">P. 221.</note>, and something he seems to hint of the Inferior Clergys sitting apart from the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops after they had a <hi>Prolocutor</hi> of their own <note n="†" place="margin">P. 220.</note>. And this is all he knows of the matter. I will add a few Particulars on this Head which a man of his <hi>Research</hi> methinks should have been no stranger to.</p>
               <p>That the Clergy in Synod, whether meeting with a Parliament, or at different times from it, sat ordinarily together for many Reigns after the Conquest, is pretty well agreed on: the Like Practise of Parliaments proves it, and the Phrase
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:48421:251"/>
of our Elder Historians, who speak of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy always, as meeting in some One Particular Place, without giving us the Names of several Rooms in which they sat apart, or intimating that they usually subdivided. The Canon <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>See it in</hi> Malmsbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>ad ann.</hi> 1075.</note> made in <hi>Lanfrank</hi>'s time to restrain all under Abbats from speaking in Synod without the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolitans Leave, implys that the Greater and the Lesser Clergy then sat together: so does the Account in <hi>M. Paris</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>Ad ann.</hi> 1256.</note> of a Synod in his time call'd by <hi>Rustandus,</hi> where <hi>Magister Leonardus</hi> (an Inferior Clergyman) is term'd <hi>quasi Cleri Advocatus, &amp; Prolocutor Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versitatis</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 920. l. 10. <hi>And in another place it is said of him.</hi> In cujus Ore posita fuerunt Verba Episcoporum expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nenda p. 918. l. 6.</note> It seems, he was deputed to deliver the sense of the whole Synod, both of the Upper and Lower part of it; who therefore, we may presume, now sat and debated together. The Custom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so of Bishops sending Inferior Clergymen to represent them, though it held long after the Convocation divided, yet to be sure had its rise when they were together, and proves that ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally they thus sat. Indeed when the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacons came with <hi>Procuratoria</hi> from the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Clergy (as they often did till <hi>E.</hi> the first's time) 'tis not to be believ'd that they separated from the Greater Prelates, but deliberated and voted with them, as the Knights of Shires did at first with the Barons <note n="‖" place="margin">

                  </note> is a plain proof of this; at which he tells us, the Legat consulted with the Bishops, the Abbats, and the Archdeacons severally; and informs us withal, that
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:48421:251"/>
He himself was present in this Council <note n="†" place="margin">Cujus Concilii Actioni quia interfui, integram Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritatem Rerum Posteris non negabo. <hi>From whence also one would guess, that more of the Inferior Clergy were there, than are in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Division of the Members expressed; unless we shall say that</hi> Malmsbury <hi>came as the Proxy of his Absent Abbat.</hi>
                  </note> so that his account is to be depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on. When the Proctors of the Capitular and Diocesan Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy came to be a certain and stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing part of these Councils, (as they did in the 13<hi>th.</hi> Century) they too sometimes consulted a a part, and made as it were a distinct State by themselves. Thus we are told of Two several Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations in the Year 1296. by the Chronicle of <hi>Dunstable</hi>

               <p>After the Separation of the two Houses of Convocation was fix'd, we scarce ever find them Treating and Resolving together <hi>in Body,</hi> upon any Occasion. But if any thing hapned that requir'd Joynt-Counsels, their way was to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act it in a Committee of both Houses; wherein the Number of the Inferior Clergy exceeded that of the Greater Prelates. For instance, a Grand Committee in 1408. <hi>Ian.</hi> 25. <note n="‖" place="margin">
                     <hi>Registr.</hi> Arundel.</note> consisted of six Bishops, twelve Abbots and Priors, and of twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four from the Lower House, <hi>i. e.</hi> I suppose of six from the four Ranks or Degrees of Clergy which compos'd it; Deans, Archdeacons, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of Chapters, and Dioceses. The Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Lower House were communicated to the Upper by their <hi>Prolocutor,</hi> attended with some of their Members, More or Less, as the Importance of the Message seem'd to require; and sometimes (for instance, when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented their <hi>Subsidys,</hi> or <hi>Grievances</hi>; which they generally did <hi>together</hi>) the whole House came up with them. And whatever they had to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in Writing, or by Word of Mouth, they did it standing always, the Prelates in the mean time being Seated. Most of the Business of
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:48421:253"/>
Convocation took its Rise from the Lower House; there, regularly Taxes were first agreed on, there Articles of Reformation where drawn; in preparing which as they had a nearer Interest, so had they more Leisure for it, than those of the Upper House, who were call'd upon often to attend the Parliament, and were forc'd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ often for that reason; the Inferior Clergy continuing to sit all that while, and do Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness <note n="†" place="margin">Die Lunae prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sens Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>episcopus propter Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti Nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabilibus Fratribus sibi assidentibus prorogavit ad diem Veneris—&amp; de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandavit aliis Praelatis &amp; Clero quòd singulis diebus interim ad dictum locum convenirent &amp; laboratent circa reformanda &amp; Articulos concipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent-Registr. <hi>Arundel</hi> in Conv. 10.

               <p>I have added these Particulars, that I might not barely trace Dr. <hi>W</hi>'s Mistakes (which is too Dry, and too Humble a Task) but might with all make my Proofs of his Ignorance as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive as I could to the Reader.</p>
               <p>Whether the Clergy call'd to Parliament by the <hi>Premunientes</hi> consulted with the Laiety, or by Themselves, is a Point that the Dr. has left doubtful. But the Great Record in <hi>Ryleys Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cita</hi>

                     <hi>See part of it App.</hi> Numb. XII</note> will, I judge, go a good way towards clearing it.

<pb n="449" facs="tcp:48421:253"/>
that they divided afterwards, and consulted by themselves; since their Proxys are entred, not promiscuously, but apart from those of the Laie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The Bishop of <hi>Winton</hi> therefore, we may observe, sends up the Archdeacon of <hi>Surry,</hi> as his Proxy; and yet tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But if the Clergy sat a part from the Laiety, it was necessary for the Archdeacon, when he appear'd for his Bishop among the Barons, to make a Proxy for himself among the Clergy. Besides, I find, the Bishops and Abbats do not give Procuratorial Letters exactly to the same Persons <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>Thus in the Diocese of St.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saph, <hi>the Chapters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dean, Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon, and Clergy of the Diocese send the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry same Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, but the Bishops different ones. And when the Bishop of</hi> Hereford <hi>commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one</hi> Lug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardin <hi>(who was sent up also by the Archdeacons of</hi> Hereford, <hi>and</hi> Salop, <hi>the Chapter of</hi> Hereford, <hi>and the Clergy of the Diocese) he joyn'd another with him, who might be his separate Proxy upon occasion. The only Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to this, that I have observ'd in the List of Proxys is, That the Chapter, and Bishop of</hi> Exon <hi>return the very same. But he might perhaps be (if the Transcript of the Record be exact here) the Chapters</hi> Proxy, <hi>and the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops</hi> Messenger <hi>only, who brought his Letters of</hi> General Ratihabition, <hi>without any Power of Voting for him, in particular cases. For this Method, I find, was practis'd at that Meeting,</hi> v. g.

                  </note> as are impower'd by any of the Inferior Clergy; but if one or two of them be the same, they add a Second or Third that is different: which I take not to have been Casual, but with Design, that so He who was Proxy for the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop alone, might separate from the Rest, and act for him among the Laiety, while the Others Voted for him among the Clergy. Which I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend also to be what chiefly gave birth to the Custom of the Clergys sending more Proctors than One both to the Convocation and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the Clause [<hi>Conjunctim &amp; Divisim</hi>] in their <hi>Procuratoria</hi>; that so they might have some to vote for them in the One place, and some in the Other.</p>

                  <pb n="450" facs="tcp:48421:254"/>Once more, the <hi>Time</hi> when the Crown began to issue out Writs for the Convocation (<hi>i. e.</hi> to command the Archbishops by Writ to assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the Clergy of their Provinces) is another point, which Dr. <hi>W.</hi> would fain, if he could, determin; and in order to it, pitches upon a Writ of this kind in the 9 <hi>E.</hi> II. as <hi>the first that perhaps is extant</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">P. 101.</note>, or (which is all One it seems) as <hi>the first he has ever met with</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 225.</note> Which Learned Hint he takes care also to inculcate of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <note n="†" place="margin">Pp. 100.103.225.228.</note> that he may be sure to have Justice done him for the Discovery. But in this he is a little too vain, because neither is the Remark his Own (for he <hi>met with it</hi> in the <hi>Grand Question,</hi> p. 159.); nor, if it were, would he have any reason to boast, since it is by no means a true one: for there are several Writs of this nature extant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Date of this; particularly of the 7<hi>th.</hi> and 5<hi>th.</hi> Years of <hi>E.</hi> II. and as far back as the 11<hi>th.</hi> of <hi>E.</hi> 1. which I have already in the course of these Papers had occasion to take notice of.
And even this Writ it self is misdated, as to the Time to which it Summon'd: for whereas Dr. <hi>W.</hi> says, that it <q>call'd the Convocation to meet <hi>Feb.</hi> 9. the Parliament sitting <hi>Oct.</hi> 16. forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <note n="†" place="margin">P. 103.</note>

               </p>
               <p>But I offend, I fear in too nice a pursuit of his Errors, and shall <hi>close these Remarks</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">P. 244.</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as He does his, with the Account of a Convocation, the Circumstances of which have been much misunderstood, not only by Dr. <hi>W.</hi> but by my Lord of <hi>Sarum</hi> too, and even by our Elder Historians.

<pb n="453" facs="tcp:48421:255"/>
his Mandate of <hi>May</hi> the 2<hi>d.</hi> to <hi>Tonstal</hi> for the Clergy of his Diocese [and so of all others] to meet and send up proper Forms to their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors; as they did, I suppose; and then the Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness of the subsidy was debated, and the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of it agreed on before the Legat; but the formal Grant of it made afterwards in Two Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial Assemblys. The Common Account there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of this Legatin Synod is Fabulous, taken up in Hatred to the <hi>Cardinal,</hi> and too easily receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by <hi>Iosceline</hi> himself, without inspecting the Registers for the Truth of it; Archbishop <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker,</hi> upon the Review of his Work, being not able to set this Story right by Memory alone, for he was but Eighteen Years Old, when it hapned. Had indeed the Fact, as it is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handed down to us, been true, Dr. <hi>W.</hi> would have had reason to say, that <hi>it is not to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd in all its Circumstances in any part of our History.</hi> But as it really stood, there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Writ for New Powers, Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, or singular in it: <hi>Pool</hi>'s Legatin Synods being afterwards Summon'd and held with the very same Formalitys, particularly that in 1555, by the Acts of which it appears, that the Synods of <hi>Cant.</hi> and <hi>York</hi> were first conven'd apart (af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the same manner that they were always us'd to be in Parliament time) and then Both call'd to an Exempt place [the Chapel Royal in <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall</hi>] and there united into one National As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembly. Besides, had Cardinal <hi>Wolsey</hi> by his Power Legatin dissolv'd a Convocation call'd by the King's Writ, we should certainly have heard of it, among the 44 Articles preferr'd against him in Parliament <note n="†" place="margin">
                     <hi>See 'em Lord</hi> Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert p. 293</note>: but it not being touch'd on, or so much as hinted there, we might without
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:48421:256"/>
further Authority conclude that nothing of the kind was done</p>
               <p>Nor is the Usual Account of this Action of the Cardinal's worse than the Reason given for it; for he is made to <hi>dissolve</hi> the Convocation, because as Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> he had <hi>no place</hi> there; But, I hope, as Bishop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="margin">
                     <hi>He took</hi> Durham, <hi>and quitted</hi> B <hi>and</hi> W. <hi>while this Convocation was sitting; but the Exact Date of this Change I have not consider'd.</hi>
                  </note>, or <hi>Abbat</hi> of St. <hi>Albans</hi> he had; and might therefore in either of these Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litys have been <hi>present</hi> in the Convocation of <hi>Cant.</hi> if that had been all he aim'd at. But it was neither suita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to his Character, nor agreed well with his Temper, or his Business, to appear among the Clergy any otherwise than as a Legate: As such, he took place of <hi>Warham,</hi> and presided over the Debates of the whole Body; and had an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity by that means of poysing the Refractory Part of the Clergy in <hi>Warham</hi>'s District with Those of his Own Province, who would be more complying.</p>
               <p>Common Justice oblig'd me to say thus much in behalf of that Great Minister, who had Real Faults enough, not to be loaded with Untrue Ones. Dr. <hi>W.</hi> had much Nearer Obligations to have done this, who has <hi>eat the Bread of Wol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sey</hi> (to use an Homely, but Authoriz'd Phrase) near Half his Life, and now owes his Comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Summer-Retreat to that Cardinal's Bounty. But I find the <hi>Premunire,</hi> that transferr'd all the Cardinal's Estate to the Crown, has trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd all the Doctor's Gratitude thither too: and with reason; for the Cardinal is Dead long ago, but Crowns are Immortal. He has His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:48421:256"/>
and I have mine; which is, to do right to any injur'd Person, let his Character be what it will; and not to fall in with a Calumny know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, let it be never so Popular and Fashionable. They that defend the Dead, cannot be suppos'd guilty of Flattery, or Design; and with either of these, I thank God, there is not a Line in this Work that can reproach me.</p>
               <p>I have now offer'd all I think necessary, either to assert, explain, or justify that <hi>Double Right</hi> of the Clergy, which I at the Entrance of these Papers propos'd to maintain, their Right of <hi>Meeting</hi> at set times, and <hi>Acting</hi> within such a Determin'd Compass as I have mark'd out. There is behind still a Second Consideration, which relates to the <hi>Need</hi> that the Church has of such Meetings, and which, according to the Method laid down, I should now enter upon. But this Book has grown too much under my hands, to allow room for any New Matter here; and all therefore that I shall say of it is, that if the Church has a Clear <hi>Right</hi> to such Meetings (which by this time, I hope, is past a Doubt) she has for that very Reason a <hi>Need</hi> of them; because her <hi>Right</hi> has been publickly question'd, and actually suspended for a Time: And she has <hi>Need</hi> therefore to exert it, that she may be sure to preserve it. Upon this Foot I shall leave the Point of <hi>Expedience</hi> at present, not without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of returning to it, and giving the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as full and particular a View of the Debate on This side also, if it shall appear, that what has been already said, has not had its Due Effect on Those, whose Eyes the Author of these Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:48421:257"/>
is particularly concern'd to open; and whose backwardness to keep the Church in possession of her Greatest Priviledge, he cannot but impute chiefly to a mistaken Opinion they are in, that she has really no such Priviledge to claim. And that Mistake therefore being clear'd up, he hopes and believes, that they will be as ready to assert her Just Rights, and Espouse her True Interests as any Men. These are his present Apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Wishes, in which he shall be very sorry to find himself deceiv'd; but if so it happen, has determin'd not to stop here, but proceed on to such further Enquirys and Considerations as he shall judge proper to promote the End that he aims at: the great Importance, and Reasonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of which he is so fully satisfy'd of, that he shall think no Sacrifice, whether of his Time, his Ease, or his Fortune, too dear to be bestow'd upon it. He is sure, that he has the Perpetual Practise of the Church of Christ, and the Law of his Country on his side; and he is conscious of no other Aims in what he has undertaken, than those of promoting the Honor of God, and his Religion, and supporting our Constitution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and these As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surances and Views will, he trusts, carry him on to the End of his Work, through whatever Difficultys and Discouragements.</p>
               <p>If he succeeds in his Design, he shall think that he has not liv'd in vain; if he fails, yet he will satisfy himself in having honestly attempted it, and done what in him lay to preserve to the Body he is of the poor Remains of their Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Legal Rights and Priviledges: for he could not stand by and see the Great Rights of his Church ready to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ink, without endeavoring to
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:48421:257"/>
save them. The Events of things are not in our Disposal; it becomes private Men to do their Duty, without having a Demonstration that it shall be successful. And should it be determin'd to lay this Part of Our Constitution asleep, yet he is not without hopes, that the Truths deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd in this Book (for Truths they are) may in some Favourable Juncture contribute to awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken it. With this single Prospect, he would have undertaken the Work, had all others fail'd him; and in despair of being listned to by the Present Age, would have wrote, and appeal'd to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity.</p>
               <p>At the worst, what he has here offer'd, and shall further offer, if it have no other Effect, will yet be serviceable, as a Testimony against Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s Book, and the Pernicious Principles of it: it will let our Successors see, that his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, whatever Boasts, or Pretences it might make, was not the Doctrine of the Church and the Age in which he liv'd; but was disown'd and detested as soon as wrote: and that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stablishment of the Practise which he pleads for (if it must be Establisht) was not owning any ways to the Silence of those who were concern'd to oppose it. Especially if so it fall out, that They of the Clergy, who are not of Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s Mind, and in his Measures, shall, upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion, take some way of owning publickly to the World their Dislike of them: this will justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy the Body from having any Hand in stifling and betraying their Own Priviledges, and will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the Guilt of any Present, or Future Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from <hi>Them,</hi> at whose Door soever it lays it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="458" facs="tcp:48421:258"/>I have done with the Argument of Dr. <hi>Wake</hi>'s Book, and have now only a short Address to make to the Writer of it; whom towards the latter End of it I find thus expressing himself. <hi>This,</hi> says he, <hi>brings us to the true way of deciding the point here before us. If by the Laws and Usages of this Kingdom, the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation has a Right to Sit and Act (as this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman affirms) let those Laws be produc'd, and those Usages made out, and I submit</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="margin">Pp. 285, 286.</note>. I agree with him, that this is <hi>the true way of deciding the Point before us</hi>; and have accordingly taken this way, and no other, to <hi>decide</hi> it. I have produc'd <hi>the Laws and Usages of this Kingdom,</hi> that make out both these Rights, so incontestably and clearly, I think, as to leave no Room for a Cavil; and I call upon Doctor <hi>Wake</hi> therefore to <hi>Submit,</hi> or to shew where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I have mistook, or mis-represented those Laws and Usages. Let him not think to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Force of what has been said by Loose and General Reflections, by once again amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing us with Heaps of Foreign Precedents, and long Historical Tales nothing to the Purpose; in a word, by drawing fresh supplys from that Everlasting Magazine of Insignificant Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritys, his Common-place-Book. All this Shew of Reading (and God knows, it is but a Shew) will be of no manner of weight with Discerning Judges: the short Point between Him and Me is, as He himself acknowledges, how our Own Constitution stands, and what are the Particulars <hi>Laws and Usages of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</hi> By these I affirm, (and have proved) <hi>That
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:48421:258"/>
the Convocation has a</hi> Right <hi>not only to</hi> be Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon'd, <hi>but to</hi> Meet <hi>with every New Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and to be open'd in Due Form by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service, and a Sermon: That the Clergy of the Lower House, when thus met, have a</hi> Right <hi>of filling the Chair of it with a</hi> Prolocu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, <hi>and of being put into a Condition of doing Business: That if they have any Requests, any Motions to make, to my Lords the Bishops, the King, or his Great Council, for the Good of Religion, or the Redress of Church-Grievances, they have a</hi> Right <hi>to make them; to enter into what Debates, and come to what Resolutions they shall think fit (within their Proper Sphere) without being oblig'd to Qualify themselves for such Debates, or Resolutions by a</hi> Royal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense; <hi>which is necessary to no Synodical Act, previous to that of</hi> Making, <hi>or</hi> Enacting <hi>a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non: That in these Respects, and to these Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, the Convocation is still a</hi> Parliamentary Body, <hi>and an Essential Part of our Constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; call<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless, considering we may not so in such sort restrain the doing of our Office in the feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ruling Christ's People, Your Graces Subjects, We most humbly desire your Grace, as

as the same hath done heretofore, so from hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth to shew Your Graces Mind and Opinion to us, what Your Highnesses Wisdom shall think Convenient; which We shall most gladly hear and follow, if it shall please God to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire us so to do: with all submission and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility beseeching the same, following the steps of Your most Noble Progenitors, and conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to Your own Acts, to maintain and defend such Laws and Ordinances as We, according to our Calling, and by the Authority of God, shall for his Honor make, to the Edification of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and Maintaining Christ's Faith, whereof Your Highness is Defender in Name, and hath been hitherto in Deed a Special Protector.</p>

               <p n="2">II. Forasmuch as the Answer lately made by Your Clergy unto Your Honorable Commons, for their satisfaction in their Bill of Complaint put up unto Your Highness, doth not please nor satisfy Your Highness in some Points concerning Your Own particular Interest, specially in that Point which concerneth <hi>Laws,</hi> either <hi>Now to be by Us made,</hi> or else <hi>Old, to be by Us reform'd:</hi> for Your Highnesses better Contentation in that behalf, We Your said most Humble Chaplains, do now more especially answer unto those Points as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As touching <hi>New Laws to be by us Hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter made,</hi> we say, that the Laws and Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Christ's Holy Church, throughout all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Realms receiv'd and us'd, been clear and manifest; that the Prelates of the same Church have a special Jurisdiction and Judicial Power
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:48421:262"/>
to Rule and Govern in Faith and Good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, necessary to the Souls health, the Flocks unto their Care committed; and that they have Authority to meet and ordain Rules and Laws tending to that purpose: which Rules and Laws hath and doth take effect in binding all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian People as of theymself; so that before God, there needeth not of necessity any Temporal Power or Consent to concur with the same by the Way of Authority.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Item,</hi> they say that this Power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in making Laws in matters concerning the Faith and Good Manners necessary to the Soul's health, all Christian Princes hath hitherto rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd themselves bound to suffer the Prelates to use within their Realms, and have not claimed of the same Prelates, that they should from time to time require their Consent or License by the way of Authority, more in making of such Laws, than they do claim, that they the said Prelates should from time to time, require their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents autorysable in the giving of Holy Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to any of their Subjects, or in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cising any other Spiritual Act depending upon their Spiritual Jurisdiction; the Authority where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of immediately proceedeth from God, and from no Power or Consent Authorisable of any Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Prince; except it be that Consent that is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Princes own submission to the Faith Catholique, made not only by their Noble Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors, when they first admitted Christ's Faith, and the Laws of the Holy Church within their Realms; but also by themselves, first Generally at their Baptism, and after more specially and most Commonly by their Corporal Oaths at their Coronation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="467" facs="tcp:48421:262"/>We say also, that this Power of making Laws aforesaid, is right well founded in many Places of Holy Scripture, now so much the less neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary here to be rehears'd, for as much as that matter is at large set out in a Book now by Us put up unto Your Highness, and Your Highness your self in your Own Book most excellently Written against <hi>M. Luther</hi> for the defence of the Catholick Faith and Christ's Church, doth not only knowledge and confess, but also with most Vehement and Inexpugnable Reasons and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritys doth defend the same: Which Your Highnesses Book we reckon that of Your Honor You cannot, and of Your Goodness You will not revoke.</p>
               <p>Yet these Considerations notwithstanding, We your most humble Chaplains and Bedesmen, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering Your High Wisdom, Great Learning, and Unfeign'd Goodness towards Us and the Church, and having special Trust in the same, and not minding to fall into Contentions or Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations with your Highness in any Manner of Matter what we may do; We be contented to make Promise unto Your Highness, That in all such <hi>Acts, Laws, and Ordinances</hi> as upon Your Lay Subjects, We, by the reason of our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Jurisdiction and Judicial Power shall <hi>here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after make</hi>; we shall not Publish, nor put them forth, except first we require Your Highness to give your Consent and Authority unto them; and so shall from Time to Time suspend all such our Acts Ordinances and Laws <hi>hereafter to be made,</hi> unto such Time as Your Highness by Your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent and Authority shall have authoris'd the same: except they be such as shall concern the maintenance of the Faith and Good Manners in
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:48421:263"/>
Christ's Church, and such as shall be for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and Correction of sin, after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments of Allmighty God, according to such Laws of the Church, and laudable Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stoms as hath been heretofore made, and hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to receiv'd and us'd within Your Realm. In which Points our Trust is, and in most humble manner we desire Your Grace, that it may so be, that upon the Refusal of Your Consent (which We [presume] that we need not fear, but yet if any such thing should fall) Your Highness will be then contented, we may exercise our Juris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction as far as it shall be thought necessary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us for the maintenance of Christ's Faith, and for the Reformation of Sin, according to our Offices, and the Vocations that God hath call'd us unto.</p>
               <p>As for the <hi>Second</hi> Part, concerning <hi>Laws that in Time past hath been made</hi> by us, or by our Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessors, contrary to the Laws of this Your Realm, and to your Prerogative, as it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; to this Point We Your Highnesses most humble Chaplains answer and say, that such our Laws by our Predecessors within this Realm made, as contain any matter contrary to your Laws or Prerogative, and be not now in use, and do not concern the Faith, nor Reformation of Sin, when we shall be advertis'd of them, we shall right gladly in that part revoke them, and declare them to be void, and of none effect. So that Your said right Honourable Commons shall now dare execute Your Laws, without any Fear, or Dread, or Danger of our said Laws, if any such there be.</p>

VI. <hi>Queen</hi> Elizabeth, <hi>and King</hi> James—<hi>he had Licens'd the Clergy to make Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons,</hi> &amp;c. which seems to imply, that such a License as was then granted had been practis'd in all the Preceding Reigns. But the Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it self, if we consult it ('tis in <hi>Bibl. Reg.</hi> and <hi>Sparrow</hi>) sets this matter right. The Words of it are these,
<q>We therefore out of our Princely Inclination to Uniformity and Peace, in matters especially which concern the Holy Worship of God, proposing to our selves herein the Pious Example of King <hi>E.</hi> the VI<hi>th.</hi> and Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who sent forth Injunctions and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders about the Divine Service, and other Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiastical mat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ers; and of our Dear Father of Blessed M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>mory, King <hi>Iames,</hi> who pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish'd
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:48421:286"/>
a Book of Constitutions and Canons Ecclesiastical; — have thought good to give them free leave to <hi>Treat</hi> in Convoc. and <hi>agree upon</hi> certain Other Canons, necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the Advancement of God's Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
The Example of the Two first of these Princes is vouch'd only in relation to their Issuing forth <hi>Orders and Injunctions about Divine Service, and other Ecclesiastical Matters:</hi> The last is propos'd as a Pattern also for Commissioning the Convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to <hi>Treat</hi> and <hi>agree upon Canons.</hi> The mentioning these Three Princes in the Course of the same Sentence, though for different Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, may create some Ambiguity; which will be clear'd, if we observe, that in King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Letters Patents confirming the Canons of 1603. (annex'd to the Edition of them in 1604.) there is no Pretence of any Precedent for such a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense as he then granted: though had any such before that time issu'd, King <hi>Iames</hi>'s Instrument of Confirmation would have refer'd to it, no doubt, as King <hi>Charles</hi> the 1sts. did afterwards to his.</p>
            <p>The Drawer up of this Instrument seems on purpose to have contriv'd such an Artful Form of Words as might lead an Unwary Reader in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Belief, that the Practice of Licensing the Conv. was Older than really it was; and yet, when examin'd strictly, could not be laid hold of.</p>
            <p>This Objection has not been made hitherto by any that have written on this Subject. And I mention it therefore, only to prevent a Future Cavil.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="516" facs="tcp:48421:287"/>P. 461. As this Book was finishing, Dr. <hi>Bradys</hi> late learned Work came to my hands; in whose <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendix</hi> I find printed the Instrument first plac'd in mine. Had I known it sooner, I would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have referr'd the Reader thither; for he took his Copy from the Record it self, I mine only from a Register. The Transcripts of that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Person are Exact always, and securely to be rely'd on.</p>
