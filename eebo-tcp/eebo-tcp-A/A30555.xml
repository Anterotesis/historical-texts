         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A true Description of my manner of Life, of
What I have been in my Profession of Religion
unto this very Day; and what I am at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
by the Grace of God.</head>
            <p>I Was brought up, and Educated by my Natural Parents
in profession of Religion, according to the Customes and
Traditions of this Nation, in saying Prayers, professing
the Scriptures, and hearing men Speak upon them: And
I was exercised in the Formal Worship then upheld, to Read,
and Hear, and Sing, and Pray, according to Tradition: And
this was about the time when Prelacy was going down; but
I was Wanton and Leight, and lived in Pleasures, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the Fear of God, and knew nothing of him but by Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say,
and Tradition. Neither was I then Zealous for what I
Professed; But when I grew up towards Twelve years of
Age, something of God stirred in my Mind and Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and shewed me, That there was a Higher thing, and that
this was Darkness, and not at all the Worship of the Living
God, but Ignorance, and without his Knowledge. And then
I sought after, and followed the cheifest Presbyterian Preists
in the Country, and would have gone several Miles to have
heard one of the best of them, which seemed liker Truth
than the other; Such was then my Thirstings and desire
after God, out of the sincerity of my Heart, which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
in me: So I followed the Highest of the Priests
and Professors of that Form, and grew in Favour with them,
and was Owned among them as Religious, (then I left off
some small part of my Leightness and Vanity) and Sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded,
as having somthing of the Fear of God before me:
Then (through my industry in Reading and Hearing, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52811:3"/>
writing Notes) I gathered much Knowledge from the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of that sound and report of things Without me, as of
Christ Jesus, his Life, his Dying and Rising, &amp;c. which I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
in may self, to have peace thereby (as I thought;) but
it was in the enmity against God in my Nature all this while,
and unregenerate, though grown very Zealous in Prayer, and
Duties, and Performances; highly respecting the Sabbath
day, and my Duties, and the like: So that thus I became a
Scorn to many of my Acquaintance, and was Reproached
by the Name of a Round-head, and such like. But as I grew
up in Wisdom and Knowledge, so into Pride, and High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedness,
and forgat the Simplicity, and left the former
Innocency; and so was kept and continued in Ignorance of
the Living Truth, and but groping as a Blind man, not
knowing whether I went.</p>
            <p>Then when I was about Sixteen Years of Age, it pleased
the Lord to shew Himself a little more to me; and I was
stricken with great Terrours many times, and Judgment was
set up in me; and my Wisdom and former Knowledge was
much confounded; and my observing of my former duties of
Righteousness was become dead, and dry, and empty to
me: for when I had been Praying, I heard the Voice
oft, <hi>Thou art Ignorant of God, thou knowest not where he
is, nor what he is; To what purpose is thy Prayer?</hi> And very
often much Fear and Dread came upon me, and broke me
off from Prayer many times; and trouble came thick into
my mind, and Fearfulness fell many times upon me; Weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and Crying took hold of me; and I was stricken off my
former Delights that I had loved; and what I had gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into my Wisdom (as of Experiences, and the Knowledge
of God) died in me: And for a time I left off Reading the
Scriptures; for it was shewed me, that I was Ignorant of the
true God; neither knew, nor understood what I Read:
the Beauty of all things Vanished, and I had no Pleasure in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52811:3"/>
anything: Even the Preaching of those whom I had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
delighted to Hear, was Withered to me, and became
Empty and Barren, and he burthen of Sin lay Heavy upon
me. And many a time I sate down alone Weeping and
Sorrowing, and separated my self from the Vain wayes of
the World, and from Vain worldly People, and was made
to Reprove many often for Wickedness, though therefore I
was had in Derision; for Wrath was in me against Sin,
though my self was Ignorant of God. And I went to some
of the Ministers, and asked <hi>What this God was,</hi> but no man
could give me Satifaction herein. And thus I was hurried
up and down, and many times grievously Tempted; but
knew not where to have my Mind stayed, nor how to gain
Power over my Enemies, which were very many.</p>
            <p>But for a time, having been exercised through great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of Spirit, it pleased the Lord to manifest his Love in my
Soul, and I had sweet Refreshings coming in from his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence,
and I had Joy and Peace in abundance, and great
openings of the Mysteries of God was Revealed in me, which
the World knew not; and through Judgement was a pure
innocent Simplicity brought forth in me, and great Thirst<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
and Desires more then at the first were begotten in me
towards God; and I saw many Glorious things afar off by
way of Prophesie, and was in much Rejoycing many times,
and could sing Praises unto God; for then I was brought
out of the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> and Darkness, and could say I
had peace in Measure with God in the Light; and many
Scriptures were opened to me, and the Ministry of Christ
was looked into, which before I had been blind concerning,
and my former Sorrow was not departed from me, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten;
for Joy and Gladness filled my heart, and I grew
up to know Great things in my apprehension, and began to
run forth in my Wisdom, thinking to comprehend in my
own Knowledge, the Mysteries of the Kingdom of God,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:52811:4"/>
having the True Light shining in my Understanding; And
through my Aspiring mind, grew up into the notion of Truth,
but without the Life, only to speak of Great things in my
own Wisdom: But not knowing the Cross of Christ, to
keep Low in it, to have my Mind stayed upon the Principle
of God, to be preserved in my Peace and Joy with God,
I lost again my self, through my forward Will and Wisdom,
and runing out into Knowledge without the Fear of God;
Though I was above many of the Priests and Professors in
my Knowledge, and followed only the highest Notionists;
but the Fleshly Man was set at Liberty, and the Cross was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised,
though I was looked upon to know Much, and could
speak True Experiences; but the Judgment I had lost, and
the former Terrour was gone, and the Rod that once Smote
me was Broken, and out of the Serpent's Root sprang forth a
Cockatrice, and his Fruit was a firie stinging Serpent, upon
which I fed for many dayes: And then Pride grew more
than ever, and Self-conceitedness, and Presumption, and
Fleshly liberty to the Carnal mind: And my delight was
much in Discoursing, and Talking of the Mysteries of God,
where I spent that which God had given me, like the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digal,
and gave Holy Things to Dogs, for I wanted the true
Wisdom of the Heir of the Kingdom. And here I lived
Pleasantly, for I had the Knowledge of the Mystery of
Christ in my Comprehension; and the Mystery of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
(as I thought) was Revealed; for I comprehended much
in my Wisdom, being unsetled in the Light, which should
have guided me into the Cross; But the World was set in
my Heart, and Pride, and Covetousness, and the Earthly Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
ruled, and my Delight grew up again, from the Simplicity
I once had, growing in the Knowledge out of the Innocency.</p>
            <p>Here I ran from my Husband, after other Lovers, and had
left the Lord, my Maker; and I spent the Portion of the
Gift of God as among Harlots, and Iniquity and Sin en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:52811:4"/>
again, and Death by Sin came upon me, and the
Serpent beguiled me, as he did <hi>Eve,</hi> even when I was Innocent,
and I had Eaten of the Knowledge, and not of the Life, and
that fed a part within me, which should have been Famished,
and my Left hand knew what my Right hand did, &amp; the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
usurped power over the Man-child in me. And in this
condition, for many dayes, I travelled, and became darkned in
my Mind more and more; and had lost that which once I had
Felt and Known, and had but in my earthly Memory the
sence which before I had in the true Light, and in a Measure
enjoyed: I could tell of Experiences, but they were Dead to
me, and could speak of many Divine things in my Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations,
but I held the Truth in an unrighteous mind.</p>
            <p>Then the Witness of God began again to work in me, and
brought me to Question some things how it was with me;
and I saw my self to be Ignorant more then formerly, and
I felt Peace and Joy departed from me; and somthing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired
to be restored again to my former condition, but I grew
to be much given to the love and delights of Riches, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
in the World; I fed my self with that Knowledge which
formerly I had received in the Light, and with a Deceitful
mind could say, I once had the Love of God; and whom he
Loved once, he loves for ever. But then that was head and
ruled in me which he Loves never.</p>
            <p>And I was Wanton, and in <hi>Ishmaels</hi> Birth, which I thought
to be a goodly Child, and would fancy he might have lived
before the Lord; and in my Vanities amongst Heathens I cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified
the Lord of Life; but the Blood of that which I had
slain cryed continually, and the Witness which lay slain
gave me no rest, which the Earthly man made Merry over, for
a time, till the Lord was awakned as one out of sleep, to lay
again his Judgments upon me; and then I grew weary of all
Knowledge, and Profession, though never so High; Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
which shined deep in me, shewed me Ignorance in the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:52811:5"/>
Highest of Words; and I was tossed up and down in my
Thoughts, having lost the savour of Life which once I had
tasted of, &amp; that Tenderness which was once upon my Spirit;
And I was as a Drie Bone strewed abroad, and I became a
Reproach to my self, who once had felt the Working of
the Power of God; but was now past Sence, and might sit
down in Darkness, and look no more after Religion. And
this was partly my Resolution, seeing my self Deceived in all
Things.</p>
            <p>But in due time the Lord Awakned me, and brought me
Home, and sent the true and faithful Messenger (the First-brought-forth
of many Children) not known to the World,
for whom the Nations shall Bless the Lord; and the Message
of Eternal Light he declared, and spake the Language I
knew not, notwithstanding all my High talkings; for it was
Higher, and yet Lower then I understood; and it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended
me, and overthrew me in the height of my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
And the Lord spake to me, by Him, and caused me
to hear his Voyce, through Him; and my dim Eye was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored
to Sight, and my Understanding was Opened, and
the Vail was Rent; and I saw my self as in a Glass, to be
in the Prodigal state, and above the Cross, and without
Judgement, and without the Fear of the Lord; for my
professed Freedom was proved Bondage, in the ballance of
Equity; and my own Will had Power over me, and my own
Heart led me Captive; And the Witness being Raised, I
saw my self Where I was, and What I had been doing; I saw
I had been making an Image to the first Beast, which had a
Wound by the Sword, and did Live, whose Deadly Wound
was again Healed, and was Worshipping the Image which I
had set Up, even he Likeness of the first Beast: And I was
full of Airy Notions and Imaginations, and the Son of the
Bond-woman lived; and I saw that Harlots gone from God
had been my Companions: And I confessed I was not worthy
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:52811:5"/>
to be called a Son, who had departed from the Fathers
House, and was found Feeding upon Husks, and could not
fill my Belly; then Trouble and Distress come upon me,
and the Lord appeared a swift Witness against me, and
true Judgement was set up in my Heart, and dayes of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
compassed me about, such as was not since the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the World; and I was at my Wits end, and a day
of thick Darkness and Trouble, a day of Weeping and
Mourning, and Misery; a day of Recompence and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance
came upon me, such as I had never known, even
for many days I was compassed with Pain, as a Travelling
Woman; one Vial of Wrath after another was poured
out, and the Great Whore was to be Judged, and to
Drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, which had once
made me to Drink of the Wine of her Fornication and Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations;
my Pleasant day was turned into Mourning,
and my Merry Hours into Weeping; the Earth was
with its Glory consumed away, and the Children of my
Vanity fainted for Thirst; and I became a Reproach to the
Wicked round about me, and was some time as a Distract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
man, when the Terrour of the Lord was upon me; And
it was hard to find Patience in that Day, and to endure
this Wounded Spirit: My Sins were set in Order before
my Face, and they Reviewed by the Law of God set up in
me; and then I submitted my Neck to the Yoak, and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
my Heart from all the Glory of the World, and
from all my Acquaintance, and sought out the Fear of the
Lord, and his Judgements my Soul loved; And I gave my
Heart to seek the Lord, and I Prized his Treasure above
All things, and my Heart found Favour in the sight of
God, as I became Subject to Him. And I betook my self
to a poor Despised, Contemptible People called <hi>Quakers,</hi>
and the Lord Raised us up about this time; and now the
Lord hath Made up the Breach, and Healed up the Wound,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:52811:6"/>
and Restored ever lasting Praise and Rest in my Soul; and
she hath found her Beloved, whom from the dayes of my
Child-hood I sought, with a desire to know his Wayes;
and now I am one in the Generation of the Righteous Seed,
which was ever Hated by the Seed of Evil Doers; But I
had rather have chosen Affliction with Them, than to enjoy
the Pleasures of Sin with the Multitude: And now do I
bear Witness unto the Lord in this his Day, unto the one
Eternal Truth, as it is in Christ Jesus, of whom I am made a
Partaker (through the Faith of the Gospel) by the Word
of God, and do set to my Seal, That the Lord is True, and
his Wayes and Judgements are Equal, whereby he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deems
<hi>Sion,</hi> and her Children: And a Witness for the Lord
I bear by his Spirit, against all the Deceitful Professions of
the World, which stands in the Wisdom of Man, and not
in the Power of God; and from the Head of the great
Image, unto the Feet, his whole Body (in the Light) is seen
and comprehended, and all deceivableness of Unrighteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
is seen in its Working; And unto the pure Teachings
of God in the Spirit, do I give Testimony, and against all
the False Teachers and Hirelings in the World, by whom
the People are not Profited: And in a Measure I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the end of the Ministry of Christ, and do not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
Destroy it, but Seal to it; and am come into the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
of Peace, where every one, from the Least to the
Greatest know the Lord, and are established in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness:
And what we have Heard, Seen, and Tasted of
the Word of Life, that do we Declare, and stand Witness
for God; as we have Received the Truth, in which we
are made Free by the Son, and do Suffer, and are giving
up to Bear the Sufferings for the Seeds sake, which is not
of this World. Unto which Seed in us, God hath fulfilled
his Promises, and his Word, and hath removed the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity,
and taken away his Punishing Hand; and the Fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52811:6"/>
of his Countenance is changed into Love, Life, and
Peace; and Sorrow, and Mourning is fled away, and the
Man-child is brought forth, and the Remembrance of our
former Trouble is now past: And unto Him who is not known
in the World, though a Sufferer by it, do I bear Witness
in the sight of God, Angels and Men; and Wo unto his
Persecutors, they shall Fall, and never more Rise again;
and Sorrow and Confusion shall fill their Loynes, and the
end of his Enemies shall be accursed in deep Misery, and the
Snares of the Enemy laid for him shall hold fast their
own Feet. Now I am Despised of the World, and cast aside
of my Relations, and am not Greater than my Lord, who
was called a Blasphemer, and Deceiver, as now I am, Praised
be the Lord for Evermore, who hath Separated me from
the World, and Worldly Glory, and hath made me a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker
of his Love, in which my Soul hath full Satisfaction,
Joy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Content; and now my Habitation is in the Lord.
And thus I have Travelled through the World, even to the
End, and now am come to the Beginning of that which
never shall have an End, which the Dark mind of Man
knows not. And this hath been my Travel many a day in
Weariness, and in a Burthened Spirit; and though tossed
too and fro, yet now I have found a sure Resting Place,
even the beautiful Gates of <hi>Sion;</hi> and my Mind is staied, and
my Soul Resteth in the Enjoyment of Love, and a sure De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
is upon my Glory, my Neighbours may Rejoyce with
me for ever.</p>
