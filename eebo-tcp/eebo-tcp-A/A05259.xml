            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I beeing troubled and wearied with feare,
<pb facs="tcp:13955:3"/>
lest my children should not find the right way to heauen, thought with my selfe that I could doe no lesse for them, then euerie man will doe for his friend, which vvas, to write them the right way, that I had truely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued out of the written word of GOD, lest for vvant of vvarning they might fall where I stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and then I should think my selfe in the fault, who knew there were such downe-falls in the world, that they could hardly climbe the hill to heauen without helpe, and yet
<pb facs="tcp:13955:3"/>
had not told them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Wherefore I writ them the right and ready way to Heauen wel war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anted by the scriptures of the olde and new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which is the true word of God, and tolde them how many false paths they should finde, how they should finde them, and what care they should haue to shunne them: if they tooke a false way, what a trouble they should haue in tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning againe, what danger if they went on: and of many doubts which the world would make with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb facs="tcp:13955:4"/>
a cause, and how si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent it would bee in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Thus when I had writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto them of these things, I was at much peace, quiet and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>But as no contentment in the world continueth long, so sodainly there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose a new care in my minde, how this scroule should bee kept for my children: for they were too young to receiue it, my selfe too old to keepe it, men too wise to direct it to, the world too wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked to endure it. Then in great griefe I looked vp
<pb facs="tcp:13955:4"/>
to heauen, from whence I knew commeth al com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and looking vp, I saw a most Angelicall throne of Princely Peeres and peerelesse Princes prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for heauen, and yet by the appointment of God were heere to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort vs on the earth: then I perceiued that this Throne was the ioy of England: then I conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that the highest blud had the lowest mind: then I sawe humility looking downe-ward, while the sweet slips of her vertue grew vpward: then, euen then, Princely Lady, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held

            <p>God hauing taken your Father out of this vale of teares, to his euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting mercy in <hi>CHRIST,</hi> my selfe not onely knowing what a care hee had in his life time, that you should be

brought vp godlily, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so at his death being char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in his will by the loue and duty which I bare him, to see you well instructed and brought vp in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, I could not chuse but seeke (according as I was by duty bound) to fulfill his will in all things, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring no greater comfort in the World, then to see you grow in godlinesse, that so you might meet your Father in heauen, where I am sure hee is, my selfe being a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his Faith in Christ. And seeing my selfe going out of the world, and you but comming in, I know not

how to performe this duty so well, as to leaue you these few lines, which will shew you as well the great desire your Father had both of your spirituall and temporal good, as the care I had to fulfill his will in this, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was the last duty I should performe vnto him. But when I had written these things vnto you, and had (as I thought) some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fulfilled your Fathers request, yet I could not see to what purpose it should tend, vnlesse it were sent abroad to you: for should it be left with the eldest, it is likely the youngest should

haue but little part in it.

why I doe not, according to the vsuall custome of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, exhort you by word and admonitions, rather then by writing, a thing so vnu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suall among vs, and especi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in such a time, when there bee so manie godly bookes in the world, that they mould in some mens studies, while their Masters are mard, because they will not meditate vpon them; as many mens garments moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eate in their chests, while their Christian bretheren quake with cold in the street for want of couering; know therfore, that it was the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly affection that I bare vnto you all, which made me now (as it often hath done heretofore) forget my selfe

               <p>OH my Children, is not this a comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table labour? Our Sauiour Christ saith, <hi>Labour not for the meate that perisheth, but for the meate that endureth to euerlasting life:</hi>

sonnes and deare children) this is the cause that maketh mee so much to feare you, and those who hereafter shal come of you, because I see so many that regard not the words of our Sauiour Christ, who came from the high Throne of God, and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to vs, and prayed for vs,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.4.</note> and tooke our flesh vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and kept it without sinne, refusing no company, healing euery sicknesse and disease,<note place="margin">Math. 4.23.</note> fed the hungry, gaue pardon to euery sinner that would but aske it, dyed for vs,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.25.</note> indured the paines of hell for vs, yea, more then this, euen in our owne flesh hee ouercame sinne, death, and hel, yea, and more then that also, hee carried our flesh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

               <p>My deare Children, haue I not cause to feare? the holy Ghost saith by the Prophet, <hi>Can a Mother forget the child of her wombe?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Es. 49. 15.</note> As if he should say, Is it possible, that shee, which hath carried her child

Will shee not instruct it in the youth, and admonish it in the age, and pray for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually? Will shee not be afraid, that the child which shee endured such paine for, should endure endlesse paine in hell?

Neither must you, my sonnes, when you come to bee of iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, blame me for writing to you, since Nature telleth me, that I cannot long bee here to speake vnto you, and this my mind will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long after mee in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; and yet not my mind, but I seeke to put you in minde of the words of our Sauiour Christ, which saith, <hi>Labour not for the meate that perisheth, &amp;c.</hi>

is the cause why I write vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, that you might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fly from him with the one, nor yet loyter with the other, but that you might learne to follow him, and to take hold of him in the writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten Word of God, where you shall find him (as Christ himselfe witnesseth) and no where else.<note place="margin">Ioh. 5. 35</note>

               <p>THe fift cause is, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire you neuer to feare death; for the feare of death hath made many to deny the knowne truth, and so haue brought a heauy iudgement of God vpon themselues. A great reason, why you should not feare death is, because you can by no meanes shun it: you must needes indure it, and therefore it is meet that
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:13955:20"/>
you should be alwaies pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for it, and neuer feare it. <hi>Hee that will saue his life,</hi>

The only way not to feare death, is alwaies to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided to dye. And that thou mayest alwaies be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided to dye, thou must be continually strengthening thy faith with the promises
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:13955:21"/>

                  <hi>Meditate in the laws of the Lord day and night</hi> (as the Psalmist saith) and then thou shalt be fit to bring forth fruit in due sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: then thou shalt bee fit to serue God, thy King and country, both in thy life and in thy death, and alwayes shalt shew thy selfe a good member of IESVS Christ, a faithfull subiect to thy Prince, and alwaies fit to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne in the Christian com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth: and then thou mayest faithfully and truely say: <hi>Whether I liue or dye, I am the Lords.</hi>

And this was one of the chiefe causes why I writ vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, to tell you that you must meditate in the Word of God; for many reade it, and are neuer the better, for want of meditation.

great account, not onely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the Christians and people of God, but euen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathen and Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels: insomuch that some of them haue written, that a woman that is truly chaste, is a great partaker of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vertues; and contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, that the woman that is not truely chaste, hath no vertue in her. The which saying may well be warran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Scripture; for who so is truly chaste, is free from idlenesse and from all vaine delights, full of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and all good Christian vertues: who so is chaste, is not giuen to pride in appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell, nor any vanity, but is alwaies either reading, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditating, or practising some
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:13955:25"/>
good thing which she hath learned in the Scripture. But she which is vnchaste, is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to be idle; or if she do any thing, it is for a vaine glory, and for the prayse of men, more then for any humble, louing and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent heart, that shee beareth vnto God and his Word: who sayd, <hi>Sixe dayes thou shalt labour</hi>;<note place="margin">Exod. 20. 9.</note> and so left no time for idlenesse, pride, or vanity; for in none of these is there any holinesse. The vnchaste woman is proud, and alwayes decking her selfe with vanity, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to heare the vaine words of men, in which there is not only vanity, but also so much wickednesse, that the vain words of men,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:13955:26"/>
and womens vainenesse in hearing them, hath brought many women to much sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and vexation; as wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full experience hath, and wil make many of them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse. But some wil say, Had they onely lent an eare to their words they had done well enough. To answere which, I would haue euery one know, that one sinne begetteth another. The vaine words of the man, and the idle cares of the woman, beget vnchaste thoughts oftentimes in the one, which may bring forth much wickednesse in them both.</p>

wee women may now say, that men lye in waite euery where to deceiue vs, as the Elders did to deceiue <hi>Susan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> Wherefore let vs bee, as she was, chaest, watchfull, and wary, keeping compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with maides.

               <p>An vnchaste woman de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyeth

               <p>It may be, that some of you will maruaile, since I set downe names for the i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation of their vertues, that bore them; why I pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced not <hi>Mary</hi> in the first place, a woman vertuous aboue all other women. My
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:13955:27"/>
reason was this, because I presumed, that there was no woman so senselesse, as not to looke what a blessing God hath sent to vs women through that gracious Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, by whom it pleased GOD to take away the shame, vvhich EVE our Grandmother had brought vs to: For before, men might say, The woman beguiled me, and I did eate the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soned fruit of disobedience, and I dye. But now man may say, if he say truly, The woman brought me a Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, and I feede of him by faith and liue. Here is this great and wofull shame ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from women by God, working in a woman: man can claime no part in it: the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:13955:28"/>
shame is taken from vs, and from our posterity for euer: <hi>The seede of the woman hath taken downe the Serpents head</hi>;<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> and now whosoeuer can take hold of the seed of the woman by faith, shall surely liue for euer. And therefore all generations shal say, that she was blessed, who broght vs a Sauiour, the fruit of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, that whosoeuer feedeth of, shall liue fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: and except they feed of the seed of the woman, they haue no life. Will not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all women seek out this great grace of God,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6. 53</note> that by <hi>Mary</hi> hath taken away the shame, which before was due vnto vs euer since the fall of man?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mary</hi> was filled with the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:13955:28"/>
Holy Ghost, and with all goodnesse, and yet is called the blessed Virgin: as if our God should (as he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed) in briefe comprehend all other vertues vnder this one vertue of chastity: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I desire, that all wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, what name so euer they beare, woule learne of this blessed Virgin to bee chaste: for though shee were more replenished with grace then any other, and more freely beloued of the Lord, yet the greatest title that she had, was, that shee was a blessed and pure Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin; which is a great cause to moue all women, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they be maids or wiues (both which estates shee honoured) to liue chastly,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:13955:29"/>
to whom for this cause God hath giuen a cold and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate disposition, &amp; bound them with these words; <hi>Thy desire shall be subiect to thy hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 3.6.</note> As if God in mercy to women should say; You of your selues shal haue no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires, only they shall be sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect to your husbands: w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> hath been verified in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then women, so as it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most incredible to be belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued: for many of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would be defiled, haue been carelesse of their liues, and so haue endured all those torments, that men would deuise to inflict vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, rather then they would lose the name of a modest mayd, or a chaste Matrone. Yea, and so farre
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:13955:29"/>
they haue beene from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting to any immodestie, that if at any time they haue been rauished, they haue ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made away themselues, or at least haue separated themselues from company, not thinking themselues worthy of any society, after they haue once bin deflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, though against their wils. Wherfore the woman that is infected with the sin of vncleannesse, is worse then a beast, because it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sireth but for nature, and shee, to satisfie her corrupt lusts.</p>
               <p>Some of the Fathers haue written, that it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for a woman to be chaste, but euen so to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haue her selfe, that no man
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:13955:30"/>
may thinke or deeme her to be vnchaste. Wee read, that in the Primitiue Church, when there were warres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene the Christians and the Pagans, if at any time the Pagans had gotten the victory, that then they would seeke to deflowre the Virgins: to the which sinne before the Christians would yeeld, they would continually laye violent hands vpon themselues; in so much that the Doctours of the Church were often-times constrained to make diuers Sermons and Orati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to them, to disswade them from that crueltie, which they inflicted vpon themselues, rather then they would suffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:13955:30"/>
to be deflowred: such a disgrace did they think it, to haue but one spot of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleannesse, and yet none of these were so holy as this <hi>Mary,</hi> this pure and vnde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed Virgin.</p>
               <p>Some godly and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend men of the Church haue gathered this, that there were fiue women of great vertue in the time of the Lawe, the first letters of whose names doe make her whole name to shewe, that shee had all their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues wholly combined in her, as namely;

               <p>IF ye shall thinke me too teadious about the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming your children, I tel you, that I haue some reason for it; and the first is this, to make them reade in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the things which are written of those Saints, and learne to imitate their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.
<milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:13955:32"/>Secondly, because ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny haue made a God of the virgin <hi>Marie,</hi> the Scripture warranting no such thing, and haue prayed to her, (though there they shal find that she was a woman, yea, and a comfort to all women, for she hath taken away the reproch, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> of right belon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged vnto vs, and by the seed of the woma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> we are al saued) it was therefore fit I should speake largely of that name. Thirdly, seeing many haue <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> heretofore, and now doe make Images of Saints, to put them in minde of the Saints, and so by little and little haue at last worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped the workes of their own hands, and for feare of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the Saints, haue for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:13955:32"/>
the second Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; I thought it better to haue you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber them, by bearing their names, and by reading what they taught vs in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and how they led their liues, then by looking vpon a painted piece of Paper, or a carued stone. And this by the way may bee maruelled at, that they which loue to worship Images, neuer loue to name their Children af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the names of the Saints; for if they had so done, by this time wee should haue had no other names but <hi>Mathew, Marke, Luke, Iohn, Timothy,</hi> and such as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christ faithfully.

thing is done, thou shalt go pray; but when the time commeth, it will finde more worke for him still, and will not let him goe. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is the very figure of the diuell, and the diuell calleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe the god of this world. And if the diuell hath to do with this world, as no doubt but hee hath, then it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, that the world will neuer giue vs leaue to serue God.

               <p>WHerefore I desire you, and euery one of yours to the worlds end, that whatsoeuer seruice of God you omit, you doe not neglect priuate prayer; for many may heare the Word of God, as <hi>Adam</hi> did, and disobey it presently after: &amp; some heare the Word of of God, as <hi>Adam</hi> did after his fall, and had rather bee further off as hee had then. But priuate prayer is, to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer thy selfe and thy seruice to God, confessing thy own imperfections, and to call
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:13955:50"/>
to God for his assistance. Now when a sinner by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe calleth his owne wayes to remembrance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth his particular sinnes, then he seeth what sinne his owne nature is most subiect vnto, and prayeth earnestly against that sinne, wherwith he is most infected, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth his owne weaknesse, and wondreth at himselfe that hee is not able to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come that one sinne, as well as some other sinnes of as great force. The reason is this, the nature of man is wholly corrupted with sin, and is good for nothing; as the earth is fit to bring forth nothing but weeds, except it bee digged and dressed, and continually laboured
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:13955:50"/>
and weeded: yet one weed or other will grow in some part of the earth by nature, which will not grow in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part, though it besowne there; but some other weed will grow there, that is as ill, and one weed ouergrowing the ground, is able to make it vnprofitable for any thing: so one sinne will rule where another will not, and that one ouerrunning thee, is able to make thee an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable member of the Church: therfore thou must labour by priuate prayer to ouercome it.</p>

sauage and wilde, and consequently an vnprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble member of Christ his Church, or rather manifest thy selfe to bee no member, as the earth will bee no gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and therfore you must haue a co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinual care of your selues.

Maruell not why I write, for I wonder, that euery one which hath heard of him, doeth not write what Christ hath done for vs. For was it not a great wonder, that the onely begotten Sonne of God should come downe from heauen, and take our flesh vpon him, and keepe it without sin, and suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be buffetted, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so to haue his face spit in, and to bee most spitefully
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:13955:55"/>
crowned with a crowne of thornes? And being with out sinne, hee bare all our sins vpon him, and hauing neuer offended God, hee bare all the wrath of God, and indured the paines of hell for vs, which was due vnto vs for our sinnes, and hee hath ouercome sinne, death and hell for vs; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended into heauen to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare vs a place there; &amp; yet hee left vs not thus, but hee left his Wil and Testament, to direct vs the right way how to come vnto him; and yet hee did more for vs then this; for he taught vs in his Word, how wee should know when we were out of the way, and how we should returne into the right way
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:13955:56"/>
againe. And yet he did more for vs then this, hee promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that hee would bee with vs vnto the worlds end,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.26.</note> and whensoeuer wee wanted his helpe, do but call vpon him, and he would helpe vs. And yet hee did more for vs, hee sent preachers to call vpon vs, and put vs in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of these benefits, and to direct vs the right way to heauen to himselfe. And what promises hee hath made to vs to intise and draw vs to come vnto him, and what threatnings and warnings hee hath giuen vs to shun hell, it is impossible for mee and all the Writers in the world to write. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith,<note place="margin">Iohn 21. 25.</note> 
                  <hi>If all things which Christ did were written, the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:13955:56"/>
world would not containe the Bookes.</hi> But I am sure if all the Writers in the world, had written what Christ hath done for vs, they could not sufficiently declare it. If all the sea were inke, and all the iron in the world were pennes, and all the creatures writers, they could neuer declare the great benefits, the great blessings, and the great mercies giuen vnto vs in Christ Iesus our Lord &amp; Sauiour. What is man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Christ, more then a firebrand of hell? and what an excellent creature a man is in Christ, can hardly bee expressed; and yet there are many that are angry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there are so many bookes. Reading good
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:13955:57"/>
bookes worketh a mans heart to godlines; for euen as the fire warmeth the wax and maketh it fit to receiue a good fashion; euen so good bookes, written of the mercies of God in Christ, are the way to Christ, and teach vs how to shun the way that leads from Christ. But because I would haue you writers of the mercies of God in Christ, I will tell you what good writing of bookes doth. It maketh the the way to Christ easie to those that desire to goe in it. And I will tell you who are they that are angry with writing of bookes: they are such as are ignorant, and the more ignorant they are the more angry: they are
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:13955:57"/>
those that loue the world so well, that they cannot finde leasure to read bookes. Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith, <hi>Loue not the world nor the things that are in the world: for the loue of the world is an enmity to God.</hi> And here you see that they are ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to God; for they loue not to haue him so much written of. And they that loue not many bookes, loue not many Sermons, ney<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doe they care so much to know what Christ hath done for them, and how they should follow Christ: they are stalled with it: they loue the earth, they can talke of it yeere after yeere, and they are neuer weary. In truth, it would weary a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly minded Christian, to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:13955:58"/>
heare an earthly-minded man how continually hee will talke of the earth and earthly things; the very time that hee is in the Church, hee can hardly hold his peace from talking of some earthly thing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the whole Sabbath which God sanctified, and rested himselfe, and in mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie to him commanded him to rest, that will neuer rest from these earthly and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitorie things, for heauenly rest hee neuer respecteth. Truely I thinke he meaneth to make himselfe sure of hell heereafter: for Christ saith, <hi>Hee that loueth the world, is an enemy to GOD,</hi> And he that is an enemy to God, can neuer come to bee
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:13955:58"/>
an inheritour of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen, except hee returne, and reconcile him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to God through Christ: and hee cannot bee thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled, except he leaue his earthly affections and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend vpon Christ: for God loueth none but those, whom he seeth waiting and attending vpon his Sonne; &amp; then the Almightie God accepteth him as his sonne, and bids him call him Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and whatsoeuer hee needs, he is ready to furnish and relieue him withall: but if hee be obstinate, and will not attend vpon Christ, but attends his owne businesse and worldly affaires, GOD neuer respecteth him, how many friends soeuer hee
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:13955:59"/>
hath in the world, nor how mightie soeuer they are, and then are his riches and his friends nothing worth, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can they doe him the least good as can be thought of. Now hee that loues not writing of bookes, nor hearing of Sermons, hee hath little leasure, and lesse desire to pray this I assure you is true, and his owne conscience will tell him so much, let him examine it when he will; for Sermons, and reading good bookes, are the only means to bring a man to praier, and praier is the only meanes to helpe vs to the mercies of God in Christ; for if we heare Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and do not pray ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly to GOD, for Iesus
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:13955:59"/>
Christs sake, to send the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghost to inlighten our vnderstanding, and to sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie our hearts, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that which wee heare, we are neuer the better; for many heare and vnderstand not, and many vnderstand and follow it not: but there is none that praieth faithful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to vnderstand, and for grace to follow it, that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth not, if hee continue in true praier. The holy Ghost saith,<note place="margin">1. Thes. 5. 17.18.</note> 
                  <hi>Pray alwaies, and in all things be thankefull,</hi> and the promise is made, <hi>Aske and ye shal haue:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat. 7.7.</note> that is, whatsoeuer you goe about, pray to God to blesse it, and thanke God in prosperitie and aduersitie, or howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it pleaseth God to deale

with you; for it commeth by his prouidence, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bee thankefull to God, what crosse soeuer it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth him to lay vpon thee. Doe not as they which rage and sweare at the losse of a few earthly things; but thanke God againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that it is no worse. If it bee but for the losse of some earthly thing, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ill for the childe of God; for <hi>Iob</hi> neuer honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God so much, nor did so much good in the Church of God, while hee was rich, as when hee was poore; for when hee was rich, the diuell himselfe told God, that <hi>Iob serued him not for nothing.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Iob. 1.9.</note> As if hee should say, Thou hast giuen him

               <head>CHAP. 24. The vnthankefulnesse of rich men, a great sinne.</head>
               <p>OH, this will bee a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse against many rich men, which receiue many great blessings, and yet they bee vnthankefull: for the diuell thought, that he which receiued gifts and blessings, could not chuse but bee thankefull: and yet when <hi>Iob</hi> was rich, he neuer did God so much honour nor seruice in his Church, as when his goods were gone:
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:13955:61"/>
for before, hee was a rich man, and liued well, and gaue somthing to the poor: what should hee haue done w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> his goods else? &amp; so did many more besides him. But when all his goods were taken away, hee did not as worldly men do, he did not say, I am bewitched; or, it is the negligence of my ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants; but he said,<note place="margin">Iob 1.9.</note> 
                  <hi>The Lord giueth, and the Lord taketh, and as it pleaseth the Lord, so it commeth to passe; blessed be the name of the Lord,</hi> And thus hee became thankefull for his losses. This is a thing that euery one cannot doe: and hee was so patient and thankefull, what crosses so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer it pleased God to lay vpon him, that he glorified
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:13955:61"/>
God in his obedience, and shewed that he loued God, and that his loue was not set on this worldly wealth. So he might haue God without the world, he cared not, hee was none of those that must needes haue God and the world together, or else they will none; but hee was one that left an example to the whole Church of God to be thankefull and patient.</p>

By these considerations you shal find out the true markes of the children of God; for the wicked can heare the word, reade, come into pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like assemblies of praier: the hypocrite wil talke of faith, as if he had come presently from heauen; but to goe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a priuate place, and lay o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his heart before God, confesse his own imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and pray that hee may not be an hypocrite, hee is farre inough from it.

But the wicked want faith to goe in the name of Christ, and this is the cause, there are so many wicked praiers in the world; for they that make them, haue no faith in Christ: and without him, they haue no promise to be heard; and therefore wanting faith to come to Christ, they goe to the Saints to pray for them; and yet
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:13955:68"/>
the Saints did neuer promise them so to doe, neither doe they know whether the Saints heare them or no. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, some pray in latine, when they doe not vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what they say, nor what they pray for; but the holy Ghost saith, <hi>Pray with the spirit, and pray with the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding also.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.4.15.</note> Why say they, God knowes our harts; we pray with the heart. God knowes indeede that their hearts are vaine and foolish, because they doe not pray with vnderstanding, and therefore they haue no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to be heard, &amp; yet they will haue a paire of beades, and tell how many prayers they say, though they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell what they say. I dare

vndertake, a parret might pray as well they doe, if it could speake all the words. They pray while they liue, that they may goe to purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory; and when they die, they giue much goods to others, to pray that they may come out of purgatorie againe: these are most vaine praiers neuer warranted by the word of God. They pray also to our Ladie to helpe them, much as the Israelites praied to the Queene of heauen: and as the Israelites praiers were accepted, so are theirs. But I pray God, for Christs sake, that you, nor none of yours may make such prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. And I pray God to blesse his whole Church, that their praiers may bee right and
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:13955:69"/>
faithfull, for prayer is the key which openeth vnto vertue. Oh Lord, let not our praiers be turned into sinne; for then the gates of thy mercy shall bee shut against vs. Wherefore wee humbly beseech thee, giue vs the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of truth, that we may pray rightly, which if we doe, wee must needs search the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures &amp; see there how Christ teacheth his Disciples to pray. <hi>When ye pray, pray on this manner.

               <p>SEeing some pray not at all, and others pray false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, doe yee often and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestlie pray for the holie Ghost; for I will tell you what hee will doe, hee will inlighten you, and vnite you to Christ, and giue you grace to rule ouer all your affections, and make you able to bee masters of your selues: where on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie side, they which haue not the holie Ghost written within them, are mastered and ruled by their owne fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy affections, and so be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come seruants to them; but
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:13955:72"/>
if yee haue the holie Spirit, yee shall bee able to say to your selues, as the master saith to his seruants, Thou shalt doe this, and, Thou shalt doe that: Thou shalt not sweare, nor blaspheme thy God; Thou shalt not drinke and swill like a beast, neither shalt thou come in companie among such, &amp;c. Reason thus, I will ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come thee by Gods grace, thou earthen potsheard, which broughtest mee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and wouldst thou now confound all these ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent graces, which it hath pleased the almightie God to bestow vpon mee in Christ? no, by the grace of God, I will rule ouer thee, or else I will pine thee.

               <head>CHAP. 32. God accepts weake Prayers.</head>
               <p>IT is a very weake Prayer that God will not accept, if it be rightly made. I speake thus much, because I would not haue you discouraged, and thinke you had as good not pray at al, as pray weakly for the almighty God accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:13955:75"/>
your obedience and wel meaning, that you will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare your selues to pray as wel as you can. But if thou see thy selfe neglect priuate prayer, be sure that satan hath som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to worke against thee; and by this you may vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, that there are none that euer did or shall perish, but it was, because either they did not pray at all, or else because they did not pray as God hath warranted them in his word. Me thinks if I were a man and a preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Gods word, as (I hope) some of you shall be, and I pray God for Christs sake, you may, I surely perswade my selfe, that through Gods grace I should bring many to pray rightly, which now
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:13955:76"/>
pray vnaduisedly or not at all. But those that haue got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten a custome to pray after the inuention of men, and contrary to the word of God, as to pray to Saints, to pray to Angels, to pray to our lady, to pray in a tongue they vnderstand not, to pray to the dead, to pray for the dead, to pray to goe to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory; these, I say, you may pray for, that they may not vse such prayers any longer, but to perswade them, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most as vain as their praiers. Yet once againe I say vnto you, Pray: for you haue no promise except you Pray.<note place="margin">Mat.7.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Aske, and you shall haue</hi> (saith Christ) <hi>he</hi> doth not say, you shall haue, whether <hi>you</hi> aske or no: but he saith, <hi>Aske, and
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:13955:76"/>
you shall haue.</hi> Was not this a great mercy of our Sauiour Iesus Christ to proffer vs, if we would but aske, we should haue. Surely, I thinke hee were a very vnworthy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that would thinke much to aske a thing, for which he might be the better foreuer. If a master should say to his seruant, when such a lease comes out, aske mee for it, and I will let thee haue a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie good peniworth in it: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou hast spent thy time in my seruice and in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending vpon me, therefore I would haue you get some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to liue vpon hereafter to defend the world withall, that thou maiest not begge when thou art old: and this were a very reasonable thing.
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:13955:77"/>
Now the Master being a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy man, and fully resolued to do his seruant good, when the time comes, he considers with himselfe, at how easie rate hee may set the rent of his farme for him to liue vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and yet giue some atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance vpon him still. The time being come, he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth when he should aske; but if the seruant thinkes much to aske, it is tenne to one but his Masters minde will bee cleane altered, although he were neuer so fully bent to deale liberally with him, and saith to himselfe, If it be not worth the asking, it shall bee worth the keeping; or, If it be not worth the asking, it is not worth thanks: and very likely hee will thinke worse
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:13955:77"/>
of his seruant, then euer hee did before, because he would not aske it, and thinke he is growne proud, and scorned his gentle offer. Now if the Master will not giue his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant the thing so promised, because he wil not aske him, although indeede he ought in conscience to giue him something; for God faith, <hi>Let not thy seruant goe away a poore man</hi>; how dost thou thinke thou shalt receiue the thing which our Sauiour hath promised, vpon the same condition that thou shouldest aske, when thou hast deserued nothing at his hands, but he of his own free mercy hath bought thee, and paid a deere price for thee, and thou hast done nothing
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:13955:78"/>
for him, but forthy begger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse he biddeth thee aske and thou shalt haue? What canst thou looke to obtaine, when our Sauiour Christ hath precisely told thee, thou must aske, &amp; yet thou refusest to doe it? <hi>Enter into thy chamber,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Mat.6.6</note> saith he, <hi>and shut thy doore.</hi> Although euerie place will serue, yet it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth Christ to name thy chamber, because he would haue a man without accum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berances. Euery man findeth one place, or other to lodge in; let them then finde the same place, or some place else to pray priuately in. <hi>Shut the doore</hi> (saith Christ) as if he should say, shut thy selfe from the world, and shut the world from thee; it may bee
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:13955:78"/>
thou hast some thing to say to mee, that thou wouldest not haue the world to heare. Oh the mercy, the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full mercie of Christ of man how hee became man for man. And hee knew the nature of man, that hee would bee loath that euerie one should know the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption which was in him, and therefore said, come to me alone, &amp; shut the doore, no body shall know, what is betwixt thee and me. I know thy sinnes alreadie, but I would know whether thou knowest them or no; for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie a man sinneth and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it not, because hee know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not my word: but if thou knowest them, confesse them to mee and I will giue thee
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:13955:79"/>
pardon for them: and if thou wilt leaue them, &amp; canst aske helpe of me, I will giue thee grace to ouercome the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>; for I haue ouercome them all for thee, euen in thine own flesh, and thou through mine help shalt doe a greater worke; for thou being a sinner, shalt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome in thy self, which is a greater worke then for me, whicham God, and without sin to ouercome sin: and yet not you, but I your Sauiour, who dwell in all those, that lay hold of me by true faith, for without me yee can doe nothing; &amp; therefore come to me, follow my counsell, come secretly, let no body know of it for hindring you, or for feare vaine glorie should follow you, no man
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:13955:79"/>
shall neede to know of it, for I wil reward yon openly. Oh the wonderfull mercies of Christ to man, neuer able to be set out! he knew that man would be desirous to haue it known that he serued such a worthy master as none could serue a better, that euery one shold say he serued Christ, he serued the son of God, who will bring him to preferme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. Euerie one desireth to haue it knowne, that hee serueth a noble master, and therefore he will weare his cognisance vpon his sleeue; that it may be knowne what an excellent man hee serues; for it is a great credit to serue a wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie master, and a man shall bee verie well accounted of for his sake: but he that ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:13955:80"/>
a wicked and vngodly man, shall neuer bee so well thought of, because his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster is wicked, &amp; he is often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ashamed of his masters doings so that he will neuer bee a credit vnto him; and therefore neuer serue a wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked man, although hee bee neuer so rich; for the desire of man is to serue a master of credit, and that Christ knew: he knew also that man was loath to haue his sinnes openly knowne; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of his great mercie and wonderfull wisdome, he appointed man to confesse his sinnes priuately, without which there can be no good praier.<note place="margin">There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of Christs seruice are hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly.</note> He told man, that he should not neede to make shew of it vnto the world; for
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:13955:80"/>
he would reward him open<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly, and make it knowne, that he serued a good ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster indeede; for hee would giue him such graces and blessings, as all that knew him, should perceiue that he had them neither of the world, the flesh, nor the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, nor of his owne nature: but it should appeare, they were onely the gifts of the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God. Hee did not promise earth and earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things, you may see; for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery venemous earthworm, is full of these: the vsurer that is as farre from heauen: as it is to hell, where if hee take not heede, in time hee may finde his part, he (I say) may bragge of his gold: the extortioner, whom God ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:13955:81"/>
may bragge of his sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: the couetous person, whom God abhorreth, hee may bragge what a deale of earth and earthly durt hee hath purchased, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet saith,<note place="margin">Hab.2.6.</note> 
                  <hi>they loade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with clay:</hi> he doth not say, God giueth it them; but <hi>they loade themselues.</hi> Among these foolish and abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble people, whom the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaketh so much a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gainst, as against no man more, nor so much, I thinke, strumpets and whores, who for couetousnesse sake sell their soules and bodies, and make themselues such filthie vessels in this earth, that it is most loathsome to thinke of, may bragge as well of their iewels and costly appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:13955:81"/>
that the world bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth vpon them, as anie other of these couetous wretches, whom God abhorreth, and giueth warning that no man shall speake well of them, for the holy Ghost saith, <hi>Speake not good of the couetous whom God abhorreth.</hi> And that thou maiest know it is no worldly trash that God bestoweth on thee: know, that the diuell calleth himself the prince of this world: and so one would think he were; for these out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things are most com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly bestowed vpon the wicked; but that which God will bestow on thee, is a trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure which the wicked ones haue not, nor are neuer like to enioy, except they leaue their wicked waies, and goe
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:13955:82"/>
priuately to the Lord Iesus Christ, and lay open their miserable estate to him, and craue his pardon and grace to liue a new life, and then he will giue thee the greatest treasure that man can ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, euen a most heauenly treasure: hee will giue thee faith, which will bring thee to the euerlasting kingdome of heauen: he will giue thee patience, to beare al the cros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses &amp; troubles in the world: hee will giue thee humilitie, which will fill thee full of grace, and make thee in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour with God and man: he will giue thee his grace so plenteously, that thou wilt speake alwaies the truth, and keepe thy promises, though it bee neuer so much to thy
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:13955:82"/>
hinderance in the sight of the world. Nay, in the sight of the world it must needs be a praise to thee, for the world seeth that euery earth-worm can breake their promise or turne it so, that it is worse then a promise breaking for it sheweth that they are full of hyprocrisie, dissemblers, and would serue the world, and would not haue the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell know it: but the diuell will not bee so deceiued, hee maketh account the world is his, and hee hampereth all those that loue it, in chaines, and hee will haue the world know it, that it may bee a witnesse on his side at the day of Iudgement. Nay,<note place="margin">The dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of breaking promise.</note> his owne conscience will bee a witnesse against him
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:13955:83"/>
at the day of iudgement, that breaketh his word, euen at that dreadfull day, when the trash, for which hee so lightly regarded his promise, shall bee consu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with fire &amp; brimstone, then will hee wonder, hee could thinke it would bee so long before that day would come, and now seeing it is come, hee fully perswadeth himselfe, that his paine will neuer haue an end. If thou thinkest, that breakers of their word haue a roome in heauen, reade the fifteenth Psalme. But what should I speak of a roome in heauen, when indeede they ought to haue no roome amongst ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill men on the earth: nay, nor yet among the heathen?
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:13955:83"/>
for it hath beene accounted so great a shame for a man to breake his promise, that hee would rather die, then it should be sayd that he were one of those. But pray thou priuately and faithfully, and God will not onely giue thee power to keepe thy promise with men; but thou shalt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so haue grace to keepe thy word and promise thou hast made to Almighty God, to forsake the diuell, the world, and thine owne filthy affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: Which will shew o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly that thou art the ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant of God, and that God hath bestowed his manifold graces and blessings vpon thee,<note place="margin">Matth. 16. 17.</note> as Christ sayd vnto <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Flesh and bloud hath not taught thee these things, but my
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:13955:84"/>
Father which is in heauen.</hi> So euery one that beholdeth thee, will know, that neither the diuell, the world, nor thine owne flesh hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stowed these gifts on thee, but the Father which is in heauen. Blessed be the name of Christ for his bountifull goodnesse bestowed vpon mankinde; he did not onely bid men pray, and promised they should bee heard, but also told them to whom to pray; and because men durst not goe to God alone, hee bad them goe in his name, and promised that he would be there with them, and hee would be a Mediator, which none else could doe, and hee would make peace betweene God and them, and therfore
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:13955:84"/>
any might boldly come to him; hee teacheth them where to aske: priuately: and what to aske: the Holy Ghost, without the which, weare fire-bands of hell: but if we haue him, we are Saints in heauen, euen ioyned to Christ and as his members; and yet hee fearing all this would not serue, it was his greatest mercy to shew vs more concerning two men, which were praying, and made vs acquainted how they prayed,<note place="margin">Luk.18.10</note> and how they sped. Christ saith, <hi>There was Pharisie and a Publicane went into the Temple to pray.</hi> The Pharisie was one that thoght himselfe a iust man, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spised others. The Publican accounted himselfe a sinner
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:13955:85"/>
openly knowen. <hi>The Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie stood vp and prayd, and sayd, I thanke thee, oh Father, I am not as other men are, nor like this Publican: I fast twice in a weeke: and giue tithe of all that I haue.</hi> Now you may see who they bee, that say I fast, or we fast: as if they should say, I feare it shall neuer bee known that it is I, or we that fast and pray, and pay tithe of all that we haue, and that we deale iustly and keep the commandements. <hi>But the Publican stood a farre off, and durst not look vp to heauen, but smote on his breast, and sayd, Lord, be mercifull to mee a sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</hi> Heere you see wee must humble our selues, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse our sinnes; for Christ saith, <hi>Hee went away iustified
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:13955:85"/>
rather then the other: for hee that humbleth himselfe shall be exalted; and hee that exalteth himselfe, shall bee brought low.</hi> Also hee willeth alwayes to pray, and not to waxe faint, saying: <hi>There was a certaine Iudge in a city,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk.18.2.</note> 
                  <hi>which neither feared God, nor reuerenced man, and there was a widdow in the city, which sayd, Doe me iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice against mine aduersarie; but he would not for a time; yet afterwards hee sayd, Although I feare not God, nor reuerence man, yet will I doe her iustice, lest at the last shee chance to weary me, And the Lord sayd, Heare what the vnrighteous Iudge saith, and shall not God auenge the cause of his Elect, which cry and call day &amp; night vpon him?</hi> And therfore pray
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:13955:86"/>
continually. And doe not thinke (my sonnes) that I haue spoken too much of prayer; for as I sayd before, without it wee haue no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise to obtaine any fauor of God, nor yet to be kept fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> any euill by God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doe it.

               <p>NOw I would haue you know, that priuat praier is for euery mans priuat vse; and therfore there is no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine rule, neither can words be set downe what ye should say: for though we be all sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet some are more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with one sinne, some with another, and some are troubled because they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee troubled so much with their sinnes as they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire, which sort Christ cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth vnto him, saying,<note place="margin">Matth. 11. 28.</note>

               <p>THere is another thing, which I must admonish you of, that ye be not ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of a little temptation; for that is the basest thing in the world: euen as if a great Captaine should bee ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of a meane souldier, that had neither might nor policy, which must needes returne with shame to the Captaine. But it is much more shame for a Christian, that hath vowed to forsake the diuell, the world, and his owne affections, to bee ouercome by the weakest
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:13955:89"/>
of them all. There be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that thinke, if the diuell ouercome them not in a great sin, all is well, though that indeede he set them on work continually on trifles, and by this meanes keepe men in some deuice or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Hee cares not what they doe, so they serue not God, and so he may blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold them that they cannot see their owne sinnes. And thus they are in a very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous and euill case, and know not what they doe; yet they shadow their folly, that the world may not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it. &amp; then they thinke it is well enough. Thus the diuell leads them quietly to hell, and they neuer know whither they are going, till
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:13955:90"/>
they come there; euen as a winde carrieth a ship, and they that are in it, know not where they shall bee set on shore For the diuell is a cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning fowler, he will neuer lay a great baite, where hee knowes, a little one wil serue the turne, and hee is so full of policy, that hee seeth a great baite would make the partie afraide to come neere it: but thus doth the diuell, first hee giueth a little baite, and saith to him whom hee meaneth to catch, I warrant thee, thou maiest take this, goe neere it, taste of it, it will not hurt thee, many swallow a greater baite then this, and thou seest no hurt come of it: as hee said to <hi>Eue,</hi> It is but an apple, it

may doe thee much good, to bring thee to knowledge, and make thee like a God. And therefore now wee see, wee had neede set a speciall watch ouer our selues, that we may spy the diuel, when hee goeth about thus to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trap vs in his engines, with his alluring baits, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne his baits againe, and when hee offereth vs any of them, may say: I defie thee, Sathan, and by Gods grace haue knowledge that thou art a wicked serpent, and diddest deceiue our first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents with an apple. I will not play with thy baits, bee they neuer so sweete, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant, or beautifull. I know thy subtiltie, and I know that I serue a Captaine,

Christ, that thou art afraide of, and he will bring vs to a happier Paradice, then thou didst put vs out of, and hee will make mee like a God, and renue the image that thou didst decay in vs. Thou didst scoffe at mee, and saidst, I should haue knowledg, when thou woul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest haue vtterlie ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwne mee; yet I haue this knowledge (I thanke the almightie God for it) that now I can see thy poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and how thou camest to our Parents, when they were alone; thou though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test they could not stand by themselues: but thou shalt neuer finde mee alone; I know I cannot stand by my selfe, and therefore I draw

neere vnto my Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ by faith, and I will attend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, and will not leaue his Commaundement vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, for all thy baits and allureme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts thou canst shew mee in the world, where thou callest thy selfe Prince, but thou gettest it by wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked policy, and thou rulest it by a wicked tyranny, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroying the good, and maintaining the wicked, &amp; bestowest thy trash on them not for any loue thou bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to them, but to make them thy wicked instru<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ments, that thou maiest doe the more hurt by them And as soone as they haue serued thy turne a while, thou wilt bring them to
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:13955:92"/>
shame in this world, and euerlasting destruction in hell fire. And therefore now I would haue thee know, that I haue knowledge, and perceiue that all these vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping tyrants haue learned all their mischieuous poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of thee, vsing all meanes they can possibly, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the good, and with their paltrie trash, which they call their wealth, they winne the wicked to their wils; and when they haue their purpose a while, they will picke some quarrell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, although they haue no reason for it, and although they follow their wicked wils neuer so much, yet in the ende they will o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uercome them. And so,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:13955:92"/>
Sathan, dost thou deale with all that serue thee; and therefore thou art an vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping tyrant: for the earth is my Lords, who hath made it, and all that is therein; and that which belongeth vnto thee, is nothing but that trash, that he careth not for: it is like tares, and the worser sort of graine, more fit to feede swine, then for the children of so mightie a King as my Lord is, who hath such treasure for those that belong vnto him, as thou shalt neuer come neere. Yet this is thy des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pight and enuie, because thou canst get none of it thy selfe, thou wouldest haue mee haue none of it neither. But thou shalt not

deceiue me with these earth then baits, which one day my almightie God shall set on fire about their eares that loue them so well, when themselues shall be sudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly strangled with the smoak thereof: and it makes mee maruell, how thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest deceiue so many as thou dost with them; for once my gracious Lorde drowned them &amp; all that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued them, &amp; many times he sinketh very much trash in the sea, that Pirats might see they shall sinke one day, and all those that sell their soules for such trash, except they turne speedily vnto my Lord and and Sauiour Iefus Christ, who is a Sauiour and will saue all sinners that
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:13955:93"/>
turne vnto him. But thou art a destroyer, and wilt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy all those that follow thee: thou knowest my Lord burnt <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrha,</hi> with other Cities, which were full of the gli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stering drosse, to shew that hee cared no more for it, then Kings do for counters: for if he had respected it, he would neuer haue burnt it, and consumed it with fire: Yet thou, Sathan, doest de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue worldly wise-men, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them drosse for gold, which is no better then cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per counters, and in the mean time thou makest the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> deceiue themselues of an euerlasting treasure.

               <p>Now though euery sinne bee a great hinderance to praier, yet idleness and couetousnesse are two of the greatest; and therefore wee ought most earnestly to pray against these sins, and to take heed of such sports and recreations, which haue no warrant in the Word of God for many are so carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away with idlenesse and pastimes, that they can find no time to pray; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we had need to be very circumspect, and watchfull ouer our selues, lest wee bee
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:13955:95"/>
snared with this part of the diuels policy: for if a man take not heed, Sathan will fill his heart so full of these vaine and idle pastimes, that hee shall neuer haue any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of preparing himselfe to pray. GOD saith, <hi>Six dayes thou shalt labour, and doe all that thou hast to doe</hi>;<note place="margin">Exo. 20.9</note> and therfore be sure there is no time appointed in these six dayes to follow your idle pleasures and sports; <hi>and the seuenth day, we must keepe holy.</hi> The holy Ghost saith, <hi>What soeuer is not of faith is sinne</hi>;<note place="margin">Ro. 14.23</note> and thou canst do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of faith, except thou hast good warrant for it in the Word of God:<note place="margin">Ephe. 516</note> and the Word of God saith, <hi>Redeeme the time, for the dayes are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</hi>
                  <pb n="172" facs="tcp:13955:96"/>
And thou canst not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeme the time with vain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations. I speake not to bar anie from lawfull recreation, but to warn you to take heed that for a little foolish and i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle pleasure, which presently commeth to an end, you lose not a glorious kingdom which endureth for euer. And this Kingdome can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer bee gotten without pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate, true and faithfull prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for although Christ hath alreadie obtained it for vs, yet we haue no promise of it, except wee lay hold on him by faith, which faith wee can neuer haue, except wee pray for the holie Ghost to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten vs, and teach vs to laie hold on Christ. You must continually call for
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:13955:96"/>
mercie and grace; mercie for thy sinne, and grace to serue God. And this I am well as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sured of, that hearing of the Word preached, is the verie meanes that God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for obtaining of faith, and by no means may wee neglect that, except you will contemne the counsell of the Holy Ghost, which I pray God for Christs sake you may neuer doe.

               <head>CHAP. 37. A dangerous let of prayer.</head>
               <p>I Will let you vnderstand in my iudgement, what is one of the greatest hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances vnto prayer that can be, but it is so close and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til an enemy vnto mankind, that I can by no meanes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couer it so well as I would; for it is to cunning, and so forcible an allurance of the Diuell, that it draweth ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more from true &amp; faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful prayer, then any net that euer hee layd: but I cannot well tell, which way to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe it vnto you. I cannot
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:13955:97"/>
say, that it is altogether co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uetousnesse: for as <hi>David</hi> saith, <hi>If it had beene an open enemie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Psal. 56. 12.</note> 
                  <hi>that had done mee this dishonour, I could haue borne it</hi>; So I may say, If it were an open sinne, which would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue you of this benefit of prayer, peradue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture I should finde some way to disgrace it vnto you; but it is a thing that carrieth some colour of goodnesse, euen amongst them that thinke themselues good, and yet indeede it is starke naught, and deceiueth a multitude, &amp; it frequenteth euery place, city and towne, and among all sorts of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, husband-men, trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and all kindes of arts and professions in the world: so that I cannot, as I would,
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:13955:98"/>
tell you which way to shun it: I would to God it were not amongst Preachers. Now as well as I can I will explaine it vnto you: it is an ouer-much care of those things which a man may lawfully vse. For man being earth, those earthly things beare much sway in his mind, and especially because they carry the name of law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full: and so they make a man forget the Law of God, and neglect the duty of Prayer; the which two things being ouerslipped, hee loseth the promise of the gospel, which is an euerlasting kiugdome. And that it is thus, I will make it more plaine vnto you, because I hope God wil giue you grace to shunne it,
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:13955:98"/>
which I desire you may for Christs sake. Man beeing earth, and Sathan being the Prince of this earth, hee la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to set mens earthen mindes altogether on this earthen world, which he may easily doe: for man beeing earth by nature, &amp; naturally enclined to loue earthlie things, he is the more easilie drawen vnto this eathlie af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. It is euen as if a man should runne downe a steep hill, hee can more easilie run downe, then goe vp softlie: euen so man can easier run after these earthlie thinges, then stay himselfe in a mean. He hath nothing to help his earthly nature, but grace; which hee must needes pray for, or els he can neuer haue
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:13955:99"/>
it; yet doth hee follow the things of the earth so much, that hee hath no leasure to pray for it. In the night, when he should meditate on the Law of God by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of the H. Ghost, he is thinking of some earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie thing or other, either of this bargaine, or that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chase, or such like; when of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes he might be much more happie to bee without it. And mee thinkes, hee that can think of heauen &amp; haue it, is well enough: but these kinde of people would haue heauen and earth too. It is sayd,<note place="margin">Matth. 19. 24.</note> 
                  <hi>It is as hard a matter for a rich man to be saued, as for a Camell to creepe thorow the eye of a needle.</hi> And this is the cause of it, his head is so bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sied
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:13955:99"/>
about earthlie thinges that be lawfull, that hee for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets to meditate of the Law of God in the night. And in the morning when he should pray, before hee can settle himselfe to it, his earthly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sines is so much, &amp; requires so great haste, that then hee cannot stay to pray; but if hee doe, they are such pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as some offer to their Saints: they speake of God, but their hearts are on the world: some are troubled with their marchandize, som with buying &amp; selling, some coueting to grow rich, some casting to maintain their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, but their riches are so vnlawfully vsed, and so hard a matter it is for them to vse them lawfully, that it cannot
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:13955:100"/>
by any meanes be expressed. But the most mercifull and mighty God hath taught man what to doe in such a case, which is to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in his lawes day and night, &amp; then he shall bring forth his fruit in due season, and shall know when to serue God, and when to deale in the world. Take heed ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: you see what danger you are in, whilest you are heere on earth; for this is a dangerous disease, and many die of it; and therfore cleaue to the mercies of God in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, which hath giuen you such warning of this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sperate disease, saying,<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.27.</note> 
                  <hi>Labor not for the meat that perisheth, but for the foode of euer lasting life.</hi> Thus you see, what Christ
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:13955:100"/>
saith, hee biddes you not <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for earthly things,</hi> he tels you, <hi>they perish</hi>; he bids you labour for the food of the soule, which shal neuer haue end. The holy Ghost saith,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4. 8.</note>

Euen so our louing father in Christ tels vs by the mouth of his Son our Sauiour, that we should not care for these earthlie things, for they shall bee gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vnto vs: but wee must care for the Kingdome of heauen; for that cannot bee gotten without care and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring for; and this is a thing worth our labour, this is a kingdome, and lasteth for euer; it will bring com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to your hearts, euen in this life, and bring you in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:13955:102"/>
with God and all good men, and euerlasting happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse without woe, want, or end. Furthermore I will tell you, what cause you haue to take care for this kingdom: if you lose it, you fal into a pit of euerlasting destructio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, where you shall be tormented with fire and brimstone for euer and euer, where no man shal euer come out againe; for there is no redemption: and therefore by all meanes pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible I aduise you to take heede. Christ endured the pains of hell for you, because he pittied you, &amp; knew you were not able to ouercome them. Therefore you may beleeue mee, if you could beare al the pains of hel one houre, and then could bee
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:13955:103"/>
deliuered, you would neuer come there againe for all the world, nay you would neuer loue the world, nor anie thing that is in it, because they are nothing but baits to draw men to destruction. But if the Diuell get you once there, you can neuer come backe againe, &amp; Christ will neuer fetch you from him; for the Diuell and hee are enemies, and he is able to liue without anie of his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: for those that will serue him, shall haue an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerlasting Kingdome, and liue in ioy and happinesse: and those that will serue the diuell, he will torment them in fire and brimstone for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer. Now if Sathan can get anie to serue him, hee is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thie

But if anie see his filthie and base waies, and consider the miserable and wretched estate it will bring him vnto, and then turne to me (saith Christ) and defie the Diuell and all his workes, and serue me, I will saue him; for I am a Sauiour, and that is my name, and my glorie: for there is no Sauiour but my selfe, <hi>I came into the world to saue sinners,</hi> but not such sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as will serue the Diuell; for though there be none in

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though all are sinners, yet those sinners that plucke vp their sinnes, as a Gardiner pulleth vp his weedes, and cast them behinde them, and follow me; although they be weake, and feare that they cannot ouertake mee, yet I will put forth my hand, and take hold of them, they shall not need to feare.<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 20.</note>

none vpon the world; for God is our Father, our Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, and gouernour, and our feeder: Christ is our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.

Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> great reason why wee should cast all our care vp-God, is, because when the diuell maketh all his poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous baits, wherewith hee draweth an innumerable company of soules to hell, hee couereth them all with some worldly thing or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that they may not see

the hooke; some hee coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth with gold, some with siluer, some with earth, some with clay, some with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, some with beautie, some with one thing, and some with another. Hee will not lay all his baits alike; for hee is cunninger then a fisher: hee knoweth a little bait, will serue for a little fish, and a great bait for a great fish; for a great bait will not serue to catch a little fish, nor a little bait will not serue to catch a great fish. And besides this, hee must haue the alteration of baits, as the cunning fisher well knoweth; but with these baits hee must haue a sharpe hooke to take them, and a long line to draw them to
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:13955:109"/>
himselfe. So soone as hee seeth they haue swallowed the sweet bait, hee lets them play a while with it, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it belong, hee draweth them out of the sweete streame, the water of life, and throweth them into a panne of boyling liquor: and as sometime the fisher is faine to intangle the fishes vvith his nets, and so take them: euen so Sathan find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the humour of euery man, and then he searcheth in the world to finde a bait fit for him, &amp; hauing found the bait he presently poyso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it: then hee puts in a hooke and a line, to draw him from the pure sweete streame, the vvater of Life, the Word of God: and then
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:13955:110"/>
hee lets them play a vvhile vvith the poysoned baits of the vvorld, and so drawes them to him, and throwes them into a furnace of boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling brimstone, vvhose boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling shall neuer end. Now there is none that can keepe vs from the baits of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell, but onely God our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>her, our gouernour, our Sauiour, our sanctifier; and had wee not neede then cast all our care vpon God, since vve are in so great a danger, and none can keepe vs from the diuell but hee? We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not keepe our selues from the baits of the diuell, no more then children can guide themselues in all their vvayes, to feed, learne, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne, &amp; clothe themselues,

Another
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:13955:111"/>
reason why thou shouldest follow Christ and depend vpon him, is, because if the diuell finde thee at any time alone, thou canst not escape his hands: and therfore my greatest desire is, that I might perswade you to cast all your care vppon God, and none vpon the vvorld: nay, I pray God, that Christ may preuaile with you, for <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> hee hath gone about to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade you already, and told you a reason, for hee careth for you: and if hee careth for you, you need no more care, for you shall bee well prouided for: therefore o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey him, cast all your care vpon him, and care not for this world; liue as hee hath appointed you, labour in
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:13955:112"/>
your vocation sixe dayes, and keepe the seuenth holy to the Lord, and in all your labour vse no kinde of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, nor desire to bee rich. Doe you labour in your vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and be sure you pray morning and euening, and at noone, and at all times &amp; heare and read the Word of God, &amp; meditate on that day and night, and follow Christ and take holde on him by faith; let that be all your care, and for your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily goods take no care. If you dare not trust God with your bodies, who feedeth them as you see euery day, how dare you trust him with your soules, which you cannot well discerne by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of your earthly nature?
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:13955:112"/>
You haue a promise for your bodies, if you wil serue God and keepe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements; and yet ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dare not trust him, they vvould serue him with all their hearts, if they durst trust his Word. If they should loose their mortall bodies, it were but a small matter, for they must haue an end. And for your soules you haue but his Word and promise, vpon condition that you follow Christ, and take hold of him by faith: now if you neglect the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the promise is void: and yet you say, you durst trust God with your soules, vvhen you neuer goe about to keepe his Commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: you neuer follow
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:13955:113"/>
Christ, nor take holde of him by faith, nor haue you any experience by your bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, for you neuer durst trust Christ. <hi>David</hi> saith,<note place="margin">1.Sam.17 34. 35.</note>

<pb n="207" facs="tcp:13955:115"/>
Here in the world none dare call a rich-man foole: but Christ saith, he is a foole that setteth his heart on these worldly things. But if by taking care for worldly things, he misse heauen, &amp; fall into hell; hee will call himselfe a thousand milli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of fooles, that omitting better things, he would take care for this world, which is worth nothing: nay, it is worse then nothing; for his own conscience wil tel him, if he had had nothing, hee should haue cared for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and so hee might haue serued GOD and gone to heauen: and hauing something, his care was so much to compasse more,
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:13955:116"/>
that indeede he had gotten nothing but euerlasting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

And he wanted faith, because his delight was not as <hi>Maries</hi> was, to leaue his worldly affaires, &amp; to heare the Word preached. Hee could not pray, that hee might profit by the Word
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:13955:117"/>
preached, because hee had no knowledge by the vvord to see his wants. He had no knowledge, because hee did not continually heare and read the word, which would haue taught him to haue knowne God and himselfe. If hee prayed sometime without knowledge and faith, his prayers were vaine and friuolous. And thus he seeth, it was his owne neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence that brought him to hell, because hee would not labour for the meat that pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risheth not, and now hee is so vexed at himselfe because he did not follow the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sell of our blessed Sauiour Christ, that took such paines for him, and gaue him so many warnings, and told

Yea, and euen our vertues, how doth Sathan seeke to poyson them? as for libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, how doth hee seeke to poyson it with prodigalitie, and honest labour with care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse?

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:13955:121"/>
but see how soone the Diuel will lay a snare to entangle the withal, that thou maist be idle; the verie bait with the which hee catcheth all: for many desire goods, that they may bee idle, and the Diuell hath most leisure to talke with a man, when he is idle; and idlenesse bringeth a man to manie vaine recreations, and so to much eating and drinking, and to manie wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked sinnes. The holy Ghost saith,<note place="margin">Matth. 12. 36.</note> that <hi>we shall giue account for euery idle word that wee speake</hi>: and therefore thou maiest not bee idle by anie meanes. Thou must labour sixe daies, for GOD hath commanded thee so to doe; and thou must doe it, not for anie care thou hast of the

And thus thou must labour sixe daies; and follow the commandement of God, and his example, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter whose image thou wert made, and whom thou art to imitate: hee laboured and made in sixe daies these things for thee, labour thou

to obey him: hee laboured and looked ouer his worke, and saw it was good. So thou must labour, and looke ouer thy worke, and see that it bee good before God. Though there are manie imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in thee, yet because thou art reconciled to GOD in Christ, and now shewest thy humble obedience to his commandement, that thou wilt neither bee idle, nor yet labour for thine owne profit nor plesure, nor doe thy owne wayes, but see that thou dost those things that hee hath appointed thee, taking hold of Christ by faith; hee accepteth them for good through Christ, who hath fulfilled all for thee: for <hi>obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is better then sacrifice.</hi>

that thou doest not think to bee the true seruant of God, but because he is richer, or is better able to pay thee, or wil giue thee more for it, is a great sin: <hi>For the earth is the Lords, and all that is therein,</hi> &amp; he hath set thee as a stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard ouer some part of it, and thou art by his appointment to let it to his children &amp; ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants that loue him; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause many things haue ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prices, he bids thee deale in all his businesse, as thou wouldest bee dealt withall in such a case.

or no Religion in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause thou seest that hee can deale more warily in the world, or more wisely, as the world cals it, though indeed it bee more wickedly before God: yet because thou seest he is more able to pay thee thy rent, thou wilt let it to him, who is indeed Gods ene<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>my, and for who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> God neuer made it: for God made these things for his children and seruants, &amp; he doth neither loue God as his Father, nor obey him as a serua<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: neither will be more becom obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to God, &amp; seruiceable to his Church, if thou let him a good peniworth; whereas if he thriue not of it, he will raile on thee, and on thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is indeede a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst

God; for he know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, that it is God that giueth power to get goods, and that it is God again, that keepeth men short: althogh sometimes with his mouth he speaketh it, yet the true knowledge of it dwels not in his heart; and if he grow rich vpon it, he will not bee liberal to the poore children of God, considering their wants as if they were his owne: for he hath no natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall affection towards them, because they are not his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Loe, heere thou seest what to do with thine own, or, as somesay, Gods and thine owne; or, as the truth is Gods, and not thine own; and therefore thou maist of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God in it: for thou art
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:13955:135"/>
but a tenant at the wil of the Lord, and art to depart at an instant; yet thou hast a great title vnder God for thy time and thy title is good, &amp; law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully thou maist inioy them, yet the loue that thou bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest vnto them is vtterly vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull; for it is the loue that thou bearest to these world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly goods, that maketh thee to let them to such a tenant, as wil neither serue God, nor doe good to the poore ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants of God. The man to whome thou lettest it, may be a ciuill honest man in the world: for among the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, yea, among the Iewes that would kil Christ again, if they had him, &amp; hate the children of God; there are such as in the world wil deale
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:13955:136"/>
ciuilly, and pay at their day, perhaps, better then some Christian. But if thou beest the true childe of God, thou must haue a discerning eye of faith, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> euery one hath not, and know the childe of God from a ciuill man: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther maist thou iudge the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for all that, but pray for him, and hope that though he be not the true seruant of God now, yet in good time, by Gods grace he may bee. Thou maiest not impart the benefits of God, as neere as thou canst, but to those who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou knowest to be the lords true seruants, and thou must do it for the loue thou bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest to God. Why shouldest thou not loue Gods childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> much more then any goods
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:13955:136"/>
thou hast? There is great reason to doe it, able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swade any man, if his heart be not of stone. For GOD made vs most excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, according to his owne image. Satan came by stelth and subtiltie, &amp; through en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uy stole away that excellent image from vs, and made vs most ougly persons, defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med diuels, so that we were ashamed of our selues, ran a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and hid our selues, and wee were good for nothing, but euil for all things, fit for nothing but firebrands of hell, into the which we were ready euery houre to fall, &amp; God had said, that if we suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the diuel to deceiue vs, hell should bee our portion, the diuel stood gaping to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:13955:137"/>
vs: wert thou not in a miserable case then? I tell thee, we were all in this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable case.

Oh, the danger is great! But tell me, wouldest thou not loue him, that would come and make thee like a God againe, and wash away al thy filthy poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and deliuer thee fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the slauery of the diuell, &amp; from the fire of hel, and set thee in Paradice againe, yea in such a Paradice as the diuell can neuer haue power to deceiue

thee? and for thy better assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance bids thee hold thee by him, and thou shalt neuer need to feare? If thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest not loue him and al his, thou wert greatly to blame. But I know now in thy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse thou dost not make so much question, whether thou shouldest loue him or no; for thou thinkest it vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>possible but that thou shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dest loue him and all his, &amp; do whatsoeuer he would bid thee. If thou wert once in Gods fauour againe, thou wouldest not disobey him for all the diuels and worlds that euer were. But ôn the misery! heere is the thing: how is it possible that thou shouldest be helped? God is thine enemy, the diuell is
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:13955:138"/>
thine enemy, the world can doe thee no good, nor make thee cleane: for al the bloud within thy veines is corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, thy hart bloud is becom most filthy poyson, &amp; thou art become most vgly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed like the diuell, and thou art a shame to thy self, although no body see thee but thy selfe, and hell fire is so bigge, that all the water in the world cannot quench it. Thus beginning to despaire, thy torments beginne to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thou couldst see no way to escape it: but ôh the loue of God, the wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful loue of God toward thee neuer to be expressed, not for any goodnesse that is in thee; for behold here what a filthy creature thou art; but
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:13955:138"/>
for the euerlasting goodnes, that was in himself, his great mercy and wonderfull wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome he found a way, euen for his own sake; or else man and his posterity had beene burning in hell fire for euer and euer. How did he find a way? he sent his only Son to wash this filthy creature ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, his only Son, I say, the Son of God. And how did hee wash him? No water would make him cleane: hee wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with his owne bloud, &amp; he sweat water and bloud with washing of him, yea, he shed his hart bloud, &amp; gaue it man to drinke,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.27.</note> that it might enter into his heart, and so run through all his veines, &amp; so cleanse him indeed.<note place="margin">Gen. 6.12.</note>
