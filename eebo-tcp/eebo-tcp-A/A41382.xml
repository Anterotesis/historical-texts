            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THe ſhorteſt Preface will be an unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Remora to my Entry into that Spacious Field in which my Text in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages my travel; it being by the moſt Divine Expoſitor, with reſpect to its Extent, ſtyl'd the World.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore obſerve to you, That in this whole Parable of the Tares and Wheat, our Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour doth firſt deſcribe the State, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly preſcribe the Duty of his Church in its Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litancy here upon Earth.</p>
            <p>In the firſt of which 'tis evident, that tho Chriſt himſelf the Seedſman, tho he ſows only the good ſeed of Pure and Divine Doctrine, yet when the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93769:4"/>
blade ſprings up, the tares alſo appear: Tho the Church is ſtyl'd here the Kingdom of God, in which he in eſpecial governs, yet there are in it too many rebellious and undutiful <hi>Subjects:</hi> Tho the Apoſtle tells us, 'Tis the Houſe of God, in which by his <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>ſpirit,</hi> he particularly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, yet 'tis not void of <hi>ungracious</hi> and <hi>diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſervants.</hi> 'Tis <hi>Magna Domus Dei,</hi> but in it there are not only <hi>Veſſels of Gold and Silver,</hi> but of <hi>Wood</hi> and <hi>Earth;</hi> ſome to <hi>honour</hi> and ſome to <hi>diſhonour.</hi> Tho 'tis that <hi>Vine</hi> which <hi>Gods right hand</hi> hath plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yet it hath ſome <hi>dead</hi> and <hi>infertile branches.</hi> That this is the condition of the <hi>Chriſtian Church</hi> in this World, is not only the purport of this but of the Parable of the <hi>Fold,</hi> conſiſting both of <hi>Sheep</hi> and <hi>Goats,</hi> of the <hi>Barn Floor,</hi> having both <hi>Wheat</hi> and <hi>Chaffe,</hi> and of the <hi>Net</hi> incloſing <hi>Fiſhes good</hi> and <hi>bad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this purpoſe St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> in his Firſt Book <hi>De Civitate Dei,</hi> ſaith, <hi>Perplexae ſunt iſtae duae Civitates in hoc ſeculo invicemque permiſtae;</hi> The City of God and the City of Satan, are ſo intermix'd in this World, that they are not to be ſeparated till the Day of Judgment.</p>
            <p>This from all that make common Obſervation, commands ſuch an <hi>univerſal acknowledgment,</hi> that I ſhall not waſte the time in offering further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largment upon it; only from it obſerve the <hi>

of the Separation in the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> of old, and ſome others, of late, from the <hi>Viſible Church,</hi> upon pretence of Spots and Corruptions in it; notwithſtanding which, we are to be firm to that <hi>Article in our Creed,</hi> in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>One Holy Catholick Church. Denominatio ſit a nobiliori;</hi> and 'tis one, tho one part is <hi>Militant</hi> here on <hi>Earth,</hi> and the other <hi>Triumphant in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It muſt be here in a ſtate of <hi>Imperfection;</hi> 'tis at the <hi>great Harveſt,</hi> then, and not till then, it will be Perfect, conſiſting only of the Righteous, as St. <hi>Auſtine, Contra Donatiſtas, Tandent ipſam u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam &amp; ſanctam Eccleſiam, nunc habere mixtos malos, tunc non habituram:</hi> Now the <hi>Holy Church</hi> hath a mixture of unholy Men in it, which then it will not have. At that great Day <hi>Chriſt</hi> will preſent it to himſelf without ſpot, and blameleſs. Then, <hi>only the Wheat will be gathered into his Barn.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But 'tis the Direction <hi>Chriſt</hi> gives in this place [that being the moſt ſeaſonable and uſeful at this time] to which I ſhall now confine my Diſcourſe. When the Blade ſprung up, the Tarcs alſo appeared, the Servants inquiring in this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſie, and to them unexpected Caſe, <hi>Wilt thou that we go and gather them up?</hi> In anſwer to this their demand, he ſaid, <hi>Nay, &amp;c.</hi>

Where firſt he enters his Denial.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The Reaſon of the Negative, <hi>Leſt while ye gather up the Tares,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And of the Poſitive, why ſuffer'd in their growth? Becauſe at the time of the <hi>Harveſt</hi> they could more ſeaſonably, and with greater ſafety, be ſeparated from the <hi>Wbeat. Then I will ſay to the Reapers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In my procedure upon this, I ſhall endeavour firſt to ſhew you what is meant by <hi>Tares:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. What <hi>Chriſt</hi> intends in this his Anſwer: And 3. To accommodate the whole of it to our Uſe.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Diodate</hi> thinks it ſome particular Weed grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt Corn in that Countrey. Dr. <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi> tranſlates it <hi>Cockle.</hi> Others give a more general Interpretation of it, as <hi>Mala Herba &amp; planta ſemini noxia;</hi> we tranſlate it <hi>Tares:</hi>

By which may be underſtood <hi>Tyne,</hi> or a ſort of <hi>Wild Fitches,</hi> which hath ſmall <hi>fibrous Roots,</hi> and in twiſting about the Roots of the <hi>Corn,</hi> ſucks away its Nouriſhment, and hath claſpers in the Branches, that faſtening upon the Stalk, depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes it, and without greateſt hazard to it, cannot be ſeparated from it.</p>
            <p>Since in this Parable the Devil is the Sower of them, and the <hi>Tares are Wicked Men,</hi> in this Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety may be meant [as in our Marginal Notes] all noiſome Weeds whatſoever that are noxious to the <hi>Corn,</hi> and particularly <hi>Infelix Lolium Dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,</hi> which naturally diſaffects the <hi>Head,</hi> and ſo may properly de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt, Negatively, <hi>Chriſt</hi> is not to be interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this, as if he were at all pleas'd with the growth of theſe Weeds.</p>

            <p>'Tis certain the Primitive Chriſtians did inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret Chriſt, in ſaying, <hi>He came to ſave mens lives, not to deſtroy them;</hi> and here in my Text, as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring not barely a Caveat, but a Prohibition of puniſhing with death upon the ſcore of Religion.</p>
            <p>They reckon'd ſuch a Proceſs foreign to the Temper and contradictory to the Rules of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</p>
            <p>It was once St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Opinion, <hi>Neminem ad unitatem Chriſti cogendum eſſe,</hi> That none were to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:93769:9"/>
be compelled to become Chriſtians: And when the inſolence of the Donatiſts made it neceſſary for him to alter his mind, yet as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes, <hi>Semper excepit ſupplicium mortis;</hi> He al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways excepted puniſhment with death.</p>
            <p>If it had been thought lawful to puniſh Hereſie with death, the Apologies of <hi>Tertullian</hi> and the Primitive Chriſtians, would have been in a great part inſignificant.</p>
            <p>'Tis a Modern Maxime in Chriſtianity, but no where, that I can find, an Article of Faith, <hi>Poſſe Haereticos ab Eccleſia damnatos temporalibus poenis &amp; etiam morte mulctari:</hi> That Herericks con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the Church, were by the Civil Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate to be ſentenced to Temporal Puniſhment, yea to Death it ſelf.</p>
            <p>It was <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Opinion, <hi>Haereticos jure gladii coercendos;</hi> That Hereticks were to be reſtrain'd by the Power of the Sword: Which <hi>Beza</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves in his Tract, <hi>De Haereticis puniendis,</hi> where he lays down this Theſis, <hi>Haereticos interdum ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitali ſupplicio a Magiſtratibus coercendos:</hi> That Hereticks are to ſuffer Capital Puniſhment.</p>
            <p>This Queſtion was better determin'd in the more early and purer Times of Chriſtianity, as by <hi>Lactantius lib. 5. cap. 10. Defendendam eſſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligionem non occidendo ſed moriendo.</hi> Religion is to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:93769:9"/>
be defended rather by the expoſing our own, than violating the lives of others.</p>
            <p>Our Saviour here forbids their thus being ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered up, leſt the Wheat be rooted up alſo; it being evident if the ſervants had gone in that Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, they had wrong'd the Harveſt; for as St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>Multi primo</hi>

The meaning of Chriſt in the Text then is, That they might have ſpace for Repentance.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Chryſoſt.</hi> affirms, That a Heretick, tho he perſiſts with obſtinacy in his Hereſie, yet is not to be Puniſh'd with Death, with whom <hi>Euthimius</hi> conſents. Chriſt, ſaith he, in this Parable would not ſuffer the <hi>plucking up the Tares, leſt the Wheat ſhould be rooted up with them;</hi> forbidding the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> leſt the <hi>Orthodox</hi> ſuffer with them.</p>
            <p>It was therefore an unchriſtian heat in <hi>Calvin,</hi> that ſent <hi>Servetus</hi> to the Flames, and in the <hi>Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers,</hi> that commanded the Execution of <hi>Valentine Gentilis</hi> at <hi>Bazil;</hi> and in <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour in cauſing the <hi>Priſcillianiſts</hi> to be put to death; tho <hi>Sulpitius Severus</hi> ſaith of them, That they were <hi>homines luce indigniſſimi;</hi> yet he adds they were <hi>peſſimo exemplo necati;</hi> tho they were
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:93769:10"/>
the worſt of Men, yet their Execution was of dangerous Conſequence. And when <hi>Alexius</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> cauſed the <hi>Bongomili</hi> to be put to Death, who (if their Opinions were candidly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented) were ſufficiently bad, yet the <hi>Eaſtern Biſhops,</hi> diſallow'd of the Fact; and <hi>Baronius</hi> tells us, it was the ancient uſuage of the <hi>Primitive Biſhops</hi> in moving the <hi>Secular Power</hi> againſt <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reticks,</hi> ſo to manage it, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>t tamen a capitali ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicio inferendo dehortati ſunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis evident that Capital Puniſhment had its firſt riſe from the <hi>Heathen</hi> and <hi>Arrian Emperours,</hi> and in that it was after return'd by the Chriſtians upon their Enemies; it was becauſe the Man was too hard for the Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Tho it is more generally interpreted, that the Servants reſolved by the above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned Severity, to cut them off from the body of Mankind, yet others, that they intended only to cut them from the Body of the Church; and <hi>Lyra</hi> and <hi>Gorran</hi> are of Opinion, That the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants deſign to gather them up, was in ſuch a way as was proper to the Church, <hi>Separando eos a Communione Eccleſiae,</hi> by ſeparating them from Church Communion.</p>
            <p>Chriſt may probably here intend a caution and lenity in that direful and ſolemn Sentence of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:93769:11"/>
which is an <hi>Amputation</hi> or a cutting off from the Body of Chriſt; 'tis in the Name and Power of Chriſt, a delivery over unto Satan for the deſtruction of the Fleſh, that the Spirit may be ſaved in the day of the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>In comport with the meaning of Chriſt here, it was an old Rule, <hi>Non Excommunicandam mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudinem,</hi> that a multitude were not to be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated.</p>
            <p>There was to be no gathering up in Bundles in this Life: the Church did only <hi>Legere,</hi> ſelect one out of many Offenders, <hi>

            <p>The Controverſie in theſe indifferent things, lies not between <hi>Wheat</hi> and <hi>Tares,</hi> but between <hi>Wheat</hi> and <hi>Wheat,</hi> and it may be is founded only becauſe one grows in a more fertile Soyl, and on a more Florid Stalk, or is of a brighter Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xion than the other.</p>
            <p>That the true <hi>Corn</hi> ſhould thus go together by the Ears, we may be ſure is aſſignable to the hand of an Enemy, and if our Lord permits the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſcence of <hi>Tares</hi> and <hi>Wheat,</hi> much more that <hi>Wheat</hi> and <hi>Wheat</hi> grow together.</p>
            <p>'Tis as natural and uſual for Chriſtians to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer in their Sentiments in matters of that kind, as 'tis for Men to be of divers Statures and Complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, wherefore (the Apoſtle telling us; <hi>That he who doubteth is damned if he eat)</hi> by Penalties to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a conſent in one Opinion in things ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, would be as hard as for one to thruſt out his Neighbours <hi>Eye,</hi> becauſe not ſo ſtrong and piercing as his own; and would be a barbarity ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding that of <hi>Procruſtes</hi> the Robber, who meaſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all men by his own bed, and would bring them to that dimenſion, either by a <hi>Rack</hi> or <hi>Defalcation,</hi> he only torturing the Bodies, while the other wounds the Conſciences, and cruciates the Minds of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:93769:12"/>
'Tis obſerveable in this Parable, that the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants entred their Complaint againſt ſuch as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd <hi>Tares,</hi> and it was for the rooting up of them they offer'd their ſervice, to which our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour anſwer'd as in my Text, <hi>Nay,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If they had addreſs'd to their Lord with their Cenſures of their Fellow Servants, and had ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied an Inclination, becauſe in every trifling pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctilio they agreed not with the Complainants that therefore they would go and <hi>gather them up</hi> our Lord would have given them another kind of Anſwer.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were inexcuſeable in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of the <hi>great things</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> through their Zeal in the leſſer things of it, Chriſtians are much more Criminal in violating the <hi>great Goſpel Law</hi> of <hi>Charity</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs,</hi> upon the ſcore of ſuch things as are not at all required by any <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it were <hi>inimicus homo</hi> that ſow'd thoſe <hi>Tares</hi> that endanger'd the <hi>Wheat,</hi> certainly it is <hi>inimiciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimus homo</hi> that would gather up the <hi>VVheat</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Tares.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis here obſerveable, that tho the <hi>Tares</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the eys of the Servants, yet our Saviour did not adventure the well-doing of his Field up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their hand, ſo as to allow their Eradication;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:93769:13"/>
if he had given any intimation of the Field, being committed to ſuch a Conduct, as without poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of being injurious to the <hi>VVheat,</hi> the <hi>Tares</hi> might be gathered up, the force of the reaſon of his Prohibition, <hi>Leſt with them ye root up the VVheat,</hi> would be enervated.</p>
            <p>'Tis probable our Saviour deſign'd the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this, when he reſpited them till the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt,</hi> well knowing that they may then appear to be Children of the Kingdom, which through the paſſion or inadvertency of his Servants, would as <hi>Tares</hi> have been bundled up for the fire.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, In the Accommodation of all this to our uſe, though it may be indecent for me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt too particularly on the Parallel between the State of the Field, and the Condition of the Church of Chriſt amongſt us, ſo as to charge the growth of the <hi>Tares</hi> to the <hi>Supineneſs</hi> or any other default in the Servants, or to ſuggeſt, that thoſe concern'd in gathering the <hi>Tares,</hi> have not with the Servants of the Houſhold conſulted their Lord, nor taken their meaſures from him: Yet I ſhall adventure to give you the Judgments of ſuch as are of great Honour and Authority upon this Subject; and ſhall cloſe my Diſcourſe with a <hi>Recommendation</hi> of the Example of the Servants to our Imitation.</p>

The Authorities of ſuch as have given <hi>their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion in this Matter:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord Chancellor <hi>Hide</hi> his Speech to the <hi>Parliament</hi> 1660, is fill'd up with the <hi>Expreſſions</hi> of his <hi>Senſe</hi> of this <hi>Caſe</hi> and <hi>Directions for its Cure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Honourable</hi> and <hi>Pious</hi> Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hale,</hi> lamenting that the Cauſe of <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety</hi> was hindred by our preſent Conſtitutions, did declare, <hi>That the only means to beal us, was a New Act of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity, that ſhould neither leave all at liberty, nor impoſe any thing but what was neceſſary:</hi> And with the Aſſiſtance of the Lord Keeper <hi>Bridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> and <hi>Biſhop Wilkins,</hi> drew up the Form of a Bill to be tendred to the <hi>Parliament</hi> to that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>The Arch-biſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi> for the <hi>healing</hi> of <hi>Diſtractions,</hi> and for the return of a <hi>Wiſhed for Peace and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> did contrive ſome prudent Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation neceſſary.</p>
            <p>Biſhop <hi>Taylor</hi> in his <hi>Duct.

Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> in his Letter to <hi>Dureus</hi> ſaith, <hi>That which makes Schiſms perptual, ist he exerciſe of a Tyrannical Power, ſo as not to acknowledge any for Brethren, or admit any to Communion with them, who will not receive from them, in any difference of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, a Law both of believing and ſpeaking.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis the determination of a Learned Doctor of our <hi>Church, That without Controverſie, the main inlet of all the Diſtractions, Confuſions, and Diviſions, of the Chriſtian World, is by adding other Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Church Communion, than Chriſt hath done.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were it needful, I might fill a Volume with Quotations of this kind; but,</p>
            <p>I ſhall only inſtance in theſe which next to that in my Text, ought to be the greateſt Authority with us.</p>
            <p>King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt of Pious Memory, as <hi>Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabon</hi> in his Epiſtle to Cardinal <hi>Perron,</hi> informs us, <hi>Thought that for Concord there is no nearer way than diligently to ſeparate things neceſſary from the unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and to beſtow all our Labour, that we may agree in what is neceſſary, and that in what is not ſo, there may be Chriſtian Liberty allow'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Royal Martyr <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Memory, in Conſideration of the State of the Kingdom in 1641, ſpeaks thus, <hi>As for Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences among our ſelves for Matters in their own
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:93769:14"/>
nature, that are indifferent concerning Religion, We ſhall willingly Comply, with the Advice of our Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that ſome Law may be made for the exemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Tender Conſciences from Puniſhment or Proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution for ſuch Ceremonies, which by the judgment of moſt men are held to be matters indifferent, and of ſome, to be abſolutely unlawful.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The late King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second of bleſſed Memory, in his Declaration from <hi>Breda</hi> firſt, and in his Declaration for Indulgence to Tender Conſciences afterwards, gave ſufficient Evidence of his Concurrent Opinion with his Royal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors.</p>
            <p>Thus it can't but be acknowledg'd, That ſome of the Wiſeſt and moſt Learned, and the greateſt of Men in theſe Three laſt Reigns, were affected with a ſenſe of a Diſeaſe that the <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> have been labouring under, and it appears that his Majeſties Royal Anceſtors had it often in their Thoughts, and upon their Deſires, that it might be heal'd.</p>
            <p>And as for our preſent Gracious Soveraign, that now wears the Imperial Crown, and ſways the Royal Sceptre, whom God preſerve; it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that what was in the Heart of <hi>David</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath a long time been upon the Heart, and now is upon the Hand of our <hi>Solomon</hi> his Son,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:93769:15"/>
and his <hi>Hand findeth to do it with all his Might:</hi> He like a Tender and Prudent Phyſician, experiencing the inefficacy and inconvenience of thoſe corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and acrimonious Applications, that have been too long us'd, thinks it proper, inſtead of that Salt and Vinegar, which hath only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd and inflam'd our Wounds, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the Lenitives of <hi>Oyl</hi> and <hi>Balſam;</hi> moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably hoping, that the warm Beams of an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging Sun will prevail to the laying of that viciouſneſs of Temper, which the rough and tempeſtuous Wind had occaſion'd.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Healing Soveraign</hi> obſerving the Body <hi>Politick</hi> and <hi>Eccleſiaſtick,</hi> like the Man in the Goſpel that fell among Thieves, if not half dead, yet lying ſorely wounded, like the Good <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritan,</hi> is pouring in Oyl and Wine, and while he is ſo, let not any of us be like him that paſſed by on the other ſide, as all together unconcern'd, or like him that only vouchſaf'd to look, but offer'd nothing to relieve him in that diſtreſsed Caſe; but let us all to our Capacities help to the quenching thoſe common Flames, and the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laying thoſe <hi>threatning heats</hi> that have been ſo fatal to us, and contribute our utmoſt in this <hi>moſt Chriſtian Service:</hi> ſome of us by Humility
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:93769:15"/>
and Obedience, others of us by Compaſſion and Condeſcenſion, and all of us by our Prayers and Tears.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, To this we muſt reckon our ſelves o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blig'd, by conſidering the Example of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants in the Text, <hi>In ſervis habemus tam quod lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus quam quod imitemur:</hi> We have in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants both what is commendable and imitable.</p>
            <p>They cleared themſelves from a treacherous betraying the Truſt repos'd in them, of the Field, by reporting to their Maſter the unexpected ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident of the growth of the <hi>Tares;</hi> they being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd that an Enemy had done it, offer'd their ſervice to redreſs the Miſchief; that if the Enemy entred the Field by their Sloth, he might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell'd by their Zeal. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to that Inquiry, Who is that Man that is eaten up with Zeal to Gods Houſe? Anſwers, <hi>Qui omnia quae videt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſa ſatagit emendare:</hi> That if he ſees the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it too narrow and ſtrait, will endeavour the inlargement of its baſis to its due extent.</p>
            <p>If he perceives an inconvenience in the fenſe incompaſſing the Field, will conſult ſuch an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of it as may neither keep out ſuch as belong to Chriſts Fold, nor ſuffer the wild Beaſt of the Field, nor the wild Boar of the Wood, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Turk nor Pagan, to enter in. And that our
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:93769:16"/>
Zeal in this, may not be an <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> to preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitate us into unſafe and dangerous Methods, that it may not be a feavoriſh heat, that invades the Health, and threatens the Life of that Body that cheriſhes it, but that it may be a Coal kindled at Gods Altar, let us with the Servants in the Text, <hi>go to our Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So, firſt, not to be too much influenc'd by our Paſſions. <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Wrath is Cruel, Anger is outragious, and nothing can ſtand before Envy,</hi> Pro. 27. 4.</p>
            <p>So as, ſecondly, Not to take our Meaſures from the Examples of others, to return to them in proportion to thoſe undue ſeverities which at any time have been received from them, the Rule of our Saviour, Is not to do to others as they do, but as we would have them do to our ſelves.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore receive our Directions from Chriſt, and acquieſce in them, referring all to our Maſters Will, and then proceed according to his Dictates, whoſe Service conſiſts altogether in the <hi>following of his own Rules;</hi> for in ſo doing we ſhall moſt promote our Maſters Honour, and be moſt ſervicable to <hi>his Field</hi> the <hi>Church;</hi> and beſt provide, that when we ſhall be tranſlated from our Stations in his Kingdom here, we may be made partakers of his Eternal Kingdom in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:93769:16"/>
Heaven; and in the mean time, God in his infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Mercy, ſo direct the Counſels and Influence the Hearts of Men, that the <hi>Tares</hi> which at the <hi>Harveſt</hi> ſhall be gathered, may not in the mean time be able either to ſuppreſs the <hi>Wheat,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the <hi>Field;</hi> and that our Lord Jeſus, who loved his <hi>Church,</hi> and gave himſelf for it, may Sanctify and Cleanſe it, and at laſt preſent it to Himſelf a <hi>Glorious Church</hi> without ſpot or blemiſh. <hi>To Him, with the Father and the Holy Ghoſt, be all Honour, Glory, and Praiſe, both now and for evermore.</hi>
