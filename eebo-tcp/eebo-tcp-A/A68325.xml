            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

All thinges that are writte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in Goddes boke, in the Byble boke, in the booke of the holy scripture, are written to be oure doctrine.</p>
            <p>I told you in my first sermon, honorable audience<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, that I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to declare vnto you. ii. thin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ges. The one what sede shuld be sowen in Gods field, in Goddes plough land. And the other who should be the sowers. That is to say, what doctrin is to be taught in Christes church &amp; congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, and what men shoulde be the teachers and preachers of it. The fyrst part I haue told you
<pb facs="tcp:8744:3"/>
in the thre sermo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s past, in which I haue assaied to sette furth my plough, to proue what I coulde do. And now I shal tel you, who be the plowers, for Gods worde is a seede to be sowen in Goddes fielde, that is the faythful co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacion, &amp; the preacher is the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer. And it is in the gospell. Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uit qui seminat seminare semen suum. He that soweth, the husbanman, the plowghman wente furth to sowe his seede, so that a preacher is resebled to a ploughma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as it is in a nother place. Nemo admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta aratro manu, et a tergo respiciens ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus est regno. Dei. No man that putteth his hand to the plough and loketh backe, is apte for the kingdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of god? That is to say, let no preacher be negligente in doinge his office. Al be it this is <note place="margin">A place of scripture rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked or misun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand.</note> one of the places y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath ben rac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
<pb facs="tcp:8744:3"/>
as I toulde you of rackyng scriptures. And I haue bene one of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> my selfe y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hathe racked it, I crye God mercye for it, &amp; haue bene one of them that haue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leued and haue expounded it, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaynste relygious persons that would forsake theyr ordre which they had professed, and woulde go out of theyr cloyster, whereas in deed it toucheth not monke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye, nor maketh any thing at all for any such matter. But it is di<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rectlye <note place="margin">The right vn<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>derstandynge of this place.</note> spoken of diligente prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng of the worde of God. For preachyng of the Gospel is one of Goddes plough workes, and the preacher is one of Goddes plough men. Ye may not be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended wyth my similitude: in that I compare preachynge to the laboure &amp; worke of plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge, &amp; the preacher to a plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.
<pb facs="tcp:8744:4"/>
Ye maye not be offended wyth thys my similitude, for I haue ben selaundred of some per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sonnes for suche thynges. It hath bene saied of me. Oh Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, nay, as for him I wil neuer beleue hym whyle I lyue, nor neuer trust him, for he lykened our blessed Ladye to a saffrone bagge, where in deede I neuer vsed that similitude, But it was as I haue sayd vnto you before nowe, accordinge to that whiche Peter sawe before in the spirite of prophesy and sayed that there shoulde come afterwarde men: Per quos via veritatis maledictis af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeretur, there shoulde come fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes by who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the waye of truth should be yll spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of and sclan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred. But i case I had vsed this similitude, it had not bene to be reproued, but myght haue bene
<pb facs="tcp:8744:4"/>
wythout reproche. For I might <note place="margin">How our Lady myghte be compared to a saffron bag</note> haue sayed thus, as the saffrone bagge that hath bene full of sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ffron, or hath had saffron in it, doth euer after sauoure and smel of the swete saffron that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyned: so oure blessed Ladye which conceyued &amp; bare Chryste in her wombe, dyd euer after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble the maners and vertues of that precious babe which she bare. And what had oure blessed Ladie bene the worse for thys? or what dishonour was thys to our blessed Ladye. But as prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers must be ware and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ther geue not any iust oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to be sclaundered and yll spoke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of by the hearers, so must not the auditours be offended without cause. For heauen is in <note place="margin">Similitudes vsed in the Gospel.</note> the gospel likened to a musterde seede. It is compared also to a
<pb facs="tcp:8744:5"/>
piece of leauen, as Chryst saith, that at the last day, he wyll come lyke a thiefe, &amp; what dishonoure is this to God? or what deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is thys to heauen? Ye maye not then, I say, be offended wyth my similitude, for because I ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken preaching to a ploughmans laboure &amp; a prelate to a plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. But now you wyll aske me whom I cal a prelate. A pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late <note place="margin">The descrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.</note> is that man, what soeuer he be, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> hath a flocke to be taughte of hym, who soeuer hath any spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytuall charge in the fayethfull congregacion, and who so euer he be that hath cure of soule.</p>
            <p>And wel may the preacher and <note place="margin">How the prea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cher is likned to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plowma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</note> the ploughman be lykened to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. Fyrst for theyr labour of all ceasons of the yere. For there is no tyme of the yere, in whiche the ploughman hath not some
<pb facs="tcp:8744:5"/>
speciall worke to do, as in my countrey in Lecester Shire, the ploughe man hath a tyme to set furth and to assaye his plough, and other tymes for other neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary workes to be done. And the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they also maye be likened to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for the diuersitie of workes &amp; varietie of offices y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they haue to do. For as the ploughma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> first setteth futth his plough, and the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> tilleth hys lande, and breaketh it in furroughes, and sometyme ridgeth it vp agayne. And at an other tyme harroweth it, &amp; clot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it, &amp; somtyme doungeth it, &amp; hedgeth it, diggeth it, and wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth it, pourgeth and maketh it cleane: So the prelate, the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher hath many diuers offices to <note place="margin">The Prelate hath manpof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices.</note> do. He hath fyrst a busie worke, to bringe his parishioners to a tyght fayth, as Paule calleth it.
<pb facs="tcp:8744:6"/>
And not to a swaruinge fayth, but to a fayeth that enbraceth Christ, and trusteth to hys me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytes, <note place="margin">Note the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a right fayth.</note> a lyuely faith, a iustifiyng fayth, a faith that maketh a man righteous wythout respecte of workes.

makynge them to haue hertes of fleshe, that is soft hertes, and apt for doctryne to enter in. Nowe teachyng to knowe God ryghte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to knowe theyr duetie to God and to theyr neyghboures. Nowe exhorting them whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they knowe theyr duetye, that thei do it and be dilygente in it: so that they haue a continuall worke to do, Great is theyr busynes, and therefore greate shoulde be their <note place="margin">Greate busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes shoulde haue good re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>wardes.</note> hyre. They haue great laboures and therfore they ought to haue good liuynges, that they maye comodiously feade theyr flocke, for the preachyng of the woorde of God vnto the people is called meat. Scripture calleth it meat. Not strawberies, that come but once a yeare and tarye not longe, but are sone gone: but it is meat. It is no deynties. The people
<pb facs="tcp:8744:7"/>
muste haue meate that muste be familier and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall, and day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <note place="margin">Preaching is a daily meat.</note> geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto them to fede vpon. Manye make a strauberye of it, ministrynge it but once a yeare, but suche do not thoffice of good prelates. For Christ sayeth.</p>

And how few of theim there be throughout this realme that geue meate to theirr flocke
<pb facs="tcp:8744:7"/>
as they should do: the visitoures can best tell. To fewe, to fewe, the more is the pitie, and neuer so fewe as nowe. By this then it appeareth that a prelate or anye that hath cure of soule, must dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently and substancially worke and laboure. Therfore sayeth Paul to Timothe. Qui episcopatu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> desiderat, hic bonum opus desiderat.</p>
            <p>He that desyreth to haue the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of a Byshoppe, or a prelate, that man desireth a good worke. Then yf it bee good worke, it is worke.

Here haue I an occasion by the way somwhat to saye vnto you yea, for the place that I alledged vnto you before out of Hieremy the. xlviii. Chapter. And it was spoken of a spirituall worcke of God, a worke that was co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to be done, &amp; it was of shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge bloude and of destroiyng the cities of Moab. For (sayeth he) cursed be he that kepeth back hys sworde frome sheddynge of bloud. As Saule when he kepte backe the sworde from shedding of bloude, at what tyme he was sent agaynst Amalech, was refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed of God for being disobedient to Goddes commaundementes, in that he spared Agag y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> kynge. So that, that place of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prophet was spoken of them that wente to the distruction of the cityes of Moab, among the whiche there
<pb facs="tcp:8744:9"/>
was one called Nebo, whiche was muche reproued for idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, supersticion, pryde, auaiyce, crueltie, tiranny, and for harde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of herte, and for these sinnes was plaged of God and destroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nowe what shall we saye of these ryche citizens of London? <note place="margin">An admonici<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on to Londo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to repent.</note> What shall I say of them? shal I cal them proude men of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, malicious men of London, mercylesse men of London. No, no, I may not say so, they wyl be offe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded with me than. Yet must I speake. For is there not reig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in London, as much pride, as much couetousnes, as muche crueltie, as muche oppression, as much supersticio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, as was in Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo? Yes, I thynke &amp; muche more to. Therefore I saye, repente O London. Repent, repente. Thou hearest shy faultes tolde thee, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
<pb facs="tcp:8744:9"/>
the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> amend the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. I thynke if Nebo had had y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> preachyng that thou hast: they would haue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted. And you rulers and offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers <note place="margin">An admonici<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> rulers and officers.</note> be wise and circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>specte, loke to your charge &amp; see you do your duties, and rather be gladde to a<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mend your yll liuyng, then to be angrye when you are warned or tolde of your faulte. What a do was there made in London at a certein man because he said, &amp; in dede at that time on a iust cause. Burgesses quod he, nay butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flyes. Lord what a do there was for that word. And yet wold god they were no worse then butter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flyes. Butterflyes do but their nature, the butterfly is not coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touse, is not gredy of other mens goodes, is not ful of enuy &amp; hate red, is not malicious, is not cruel is not merciles. The butterflye
<pb facs="tcp:8744:10"/>
glorieth not in her owne dedes, nor preferreth the tradicions of men before gods word, it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth not idolatri, nor worshippeth false gods. But London can not abide to be rebuked, suche is the nature of man. If thei be pricked they will kick. If they be rubbed on the gale: they will wynce. But yet they wyll not amende theyr faultes, they wil not be yl spoken of. But howe shall I speake wel of them. If you could be content to receyue and folowe the worde of God and fauoure good prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, yf you coulde beare to be toulde of youre faultes, yf you coulde amende when you heare of them: if you woulde be gladde to refourme that is amysse: yf I myght see any suche inclinacion in you, that leaue to be mercyles, and begynne to be charytable
<pb facs="tcp:8744:10"/>
I would then hope wel of you, I woulde then speake well of you. But London was neuer so yll as it is now. In tymes past, men <note place="margin">The euilles y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> are nowe in London.</note> were full of pitie and compassy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but nowe there is no pitie, for in London their brother shal dye in the streetes for colde, he shal lye sycke at their doore betwene stocke &amp; stock. I cannot tel what to cal it, and perishe there for hu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, was there any more vnmer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifulnes in Nebo? I thinke not. In tymes paste when any ryche <note place="margin">The relief of poorescholers by the riche in London, is gone.</note> man dyed in London, they were wont to healpe the pore scholars of the vniuersityes with exhiby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>ion. When any man dyed, they would bequeath greate summes of money towarde the reliefe of the pore, When I was a scholer in Cambrydge my selfe, I harde very good report of London and
<pb facs="tcp:8744:11"/>
knewe many that had reliefe of the ryche menne of London, but nowe I can heare no suche good reporte, and yet I enquire of it, and herken for it, but now chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie <note place="margin">Charitie is waxen cold in London.</note> is waxed cold, none healpeth the scholer, nor yet the poore. And in those dayes what dyd, they whan they helped the scholers?

that the same god liueth now that punished Nebo, euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> same god &amp; none other, &amp; he wyll punyshe synne as well nowe as he dyd then, and he wyll punish the iniquitie of London as well as he did them of Nebo. Amend therfore. And ye that be prelates <note place="margin">An admonicio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to prelates to do their office.</note> loke well to your offyce, for right prelatynge is buisye labouryng &amp; not lordyng. Therfore preache and teache, and let your ploughe be doyng, ye lordes I saye that lyue lyke loyterers, loke well to your offyce, the plough is your office &amp; charge. If you liue idle &amp; loyter, you do not your duetye, you folowe not youre vocacion, let your ploughe therfore be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and not cease, that the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d maye brynge foorth fruite. But nowe me thynketh I heare one <note place="margin">An answer to a priuie obiec<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion.</note> saye vnto me, wotte you what
<pb facs="tcp:8744:12"/>
you say? It is a worcke? It is a labour? how then hath it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that we haue had so manye hundred yeres, so many vnprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge prelates, lordyng loyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and idle ministers? ye would haue me here to make aunswere and to shewe the cause thereof. Nay, this lande is not for me to ploughe, it is to stonye, to thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nye, to harde for me to plough. Thei haue so many thinges that make for them, so many thynges to laye for theym selues, that it is not for my weake teame to plough them. They haue to laye for them selues longe customes ceremonyes, and authorytie, placyng in parliment, and many thynges more. And I feare me thys lande is not yet rype to be ploughed. For as the saiyng is, It lacketh wethering: This gete
<pb facs="tcp:8744:12"/>
lacketh wetheryng, at leaste way it is not for me to plough. For what shall I looke for among thornes but prickyng and scrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng? what among stones but stumbling? What (I had almost sayed) among serpentes but stin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyng? But this muche I dare saye, that sence lordyng and loi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teryng <note place="margin">Lording hath put doun pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyng.</note> hath come vp, preaching hathe come downe contrary to the Apostelles tymes. For they preached and lorded not. And nowe they lorde and preache not. For they that be lordes wyll yl go to plough. It is no mete of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice for theym. It is not seming for their estate. Thus came vp lordyng loyterers, Thus crept in vnpreachynge prelates, and so haue they longe continewed. For howe many vnlearned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates haue we now at this daye?
<pb facs="tcp:8744:13"/>
And no meruel. For if y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plough me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that now be, were made lords they woulde cleane geue ouer ploughynge, they woulde leaue of their laboure and fall to lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyng outright, and let y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plough stande. And then both ploughes not walkyng, nothyng should be in the common weale but houn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. For euer sence the Prela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes were made Lordes and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, the ploughe standeth, there is no work done; y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people sterue. Thei hauke, they hunt, thei card, they dyce, they pastyme in their prelacies with galaunte gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, with theyr daunsyng miny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and with their freshe co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, so that ploughyng is sette a syde. And by the lordyng and loytryng, preachyng and plough yng is cleane gone. And thus yf the ploughmenne of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey,
<pb facs="tcp:8744:13"/>
were as negligente in theyr office, as prelates be, we shoulde not longe lyue for lacke of susty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce. And as it is necessary for to haue this ploughyng for the sustentacion of the bodye: so muste we haue also the other for the satisfaction of the sowle, or elles wee canne not lyue longe gostly. For as the bodie wasteth <note place="margin">An apt simili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</note> and consumeth away for lacke of bodilye meate: so doeth the soule pyne awaye for default of gostly meate. But there be two kyndes of inclosynge to lette or hynder <note place="margin">Two kindes of inclospuge</note> bothe these kyndes of plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng. The one is an inclosyng to let or hynder the bodily plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge, and the other to let or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the holy daye ploughyng, the churche ploughing. The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dylye ploughynge, is taken in and enclosed thorowe syngular
<pb facs="tcp:8744:14"/>
commoditie. For what man will lette goe or dimynyshe his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate commoditie for a commune welthe? and who wyll susteyne any damage for the respecte of a publique commoditie? The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther plough also no manne is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent to sette forewarde, nor no manne wyll herken to it. but to hynder and lette it, al mennes ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res are open, yea and a greate manye of this kynde of plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men whiche are very busye and woulde seeme to be verye good workemenne. I feare me some be rather mocke gospellers then faithefull ploughmen. I knowe many my selfe that professe the gospel, and lyue nothyng there after. I knowe them, and haue been conuersaunte with some of theym. I knowe theym, and I speake it with an heauye hearte,
<pb facs="tcp:8744:14"/>
there is as little charitie &amp; good liuynge in them, as in any other, accordyng to that whiche Christ sayed in the Gospell to the great numbre of people that folowed hym, as thoughe they had had an earnest zeale to his doctryne, where as in dede they had it not. Non quia vidistis signa, sed quia come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>distis de panibus. Ye folowe me (sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he) not because ye haué seene the sygnes and myracles that I haue dooen, but because ye haue eaten the breade and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freshed your bodies. Therfore you folowe me, so that I thinke manye one nowe a dayes profes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth the Gospell for the liuynge sake, not for the loue they beare to gods word. But they that wil be true ploughmen muste worke faythfully for Goddes sake, for the edifiyng of theyr brethren.
<pb facs="tcp:8744:15"/>
And as dilygentlye as the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bande man plougheth for the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stentacion of the bodie: so dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlye muste the prelates and ministers labour for the fedynge of the soule: bothe the ploughes muste styll be doynge, as moost necessarye for man. And where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are magistrates ordayned, but that the tranquillitye of the commune weale maye bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed limiting both ploughes.</p>
            <p>But nowe for defaulte of vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preachynge Prelates me thynke I coulde gesse what myghte be sayed for excusyng of theym.</p>
            <p>They are soo troubeled wyth lordlye liuyng, they be so placed in palacies, couched in courtes, ruffelyng in their rentes, daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyng in their dominions, burde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ambassages, pa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peryng of their paunches lyke a Monke
<pb facs="tcp:8744:15"/>
that maketh his Jubilie, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chynge in their maungers, and moilyng in their gay manoures and mansyons, and so troube<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led wyth loyterynge in theyr Lordeshyppes: that they canne not attende it. They are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wyse occupyed, somme in the Kynges matters, some are am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bassadoures, some of the priuy councell, some to furnyshe the courte, some are Lordes of the Parlyamente, some are Presy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes, and some comptrollers of myntes. Well, well.</p>
            <p>Is this their duetie? Is this theyr offyce? Is this their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyng? should we haue ministers of the church to be comptrollers of the myntes? Is this a meete office for a prieste that hath cure of soules? Is this his charge? I
<pb facs="tcp:8744:16"/>
woulde here aske one question: I would fayne knowe who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptrolleth the deuyll at home at his paryshe, whyle he comptrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the mynte? If the Apostles myghte not leaue the offyce of preachynge to be deacons, shal one leaue it for mintyng?</p>
            <p>I can not tell you, but the say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is; that synce priestes haue been mynters, money hath been wurse then it was before. And they saye that the euylnesse of moneye hath made all thynges dearer. And in this behalfe I must speake to England.</p>
            <p>Heare my cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trey Englande, as Paule sayed in his firste epystle to the Cor. vi. Chap. For Paule was no sittynge byshoppe, but a walkynge and a preachynge byshoppe. But when he wente from them, he lefte there behynde

<pb facs="tcp:8744:17"/>
but it muste be a prelate? Is there neuer a wyse manne in the realme to be a Comptroller of the minte? I speake it to your shame, I speake it to youre shame. If there be neuer a wyse man, make a water bearer, a tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, acobler, a slaue, a page, comp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>troller of the Mynte. Make a meane gentileman, a groome, a yeoman, make a poore beggar Lorde president. Thus I speake not that I would haue it so, but to your shame. If there be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer a gentleman meete nor able to be Lorde presydente. For why are not the noble men and yonge gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, so brought vp in knowledge of God and in learnynge, that they maye be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to execute offyces in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mune weale? The Kynge hath a greate many of wardes and I
<pb facs="tcp:8744:17"/>
trowe there is a courte of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, why is there not a schole for the wardes, as well as there is a courte for their landes? Why are they not set in scholes, where they maye learne? Or why are they not sent to the vniuersities, that they maye be able to scrue the kyng when they come to age? Yf the wardes and young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen were well brought vp in learnyng and in the knowledge of God, they would not when they come to age, so muche geue theym selues to other vanities. And if the nobilitie be well tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in godlye learnyng, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would folow the same traine. For truly, such as the noble men be, suche wyll the people be. And nowe the onely cause, why noble <note place="margin">Why noble menne be not made lord pre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>sidentes.</note> menne be not made Lorde presi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentes, is because they haue not
<pb facs="tcp:8744:18"/>
been broughte vp in learnyng. Therfore for the loue of GOD, appoint teachers and scholemai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, you that haue charge of youth, and geue the teachers sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendes worthy their paines, that they maye brynge theym vp in Grammer, in Logike, in Retho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rike, in Philosophie, in the ciuyle lawe, and in that whiche I can not leaue vnspoken of, the worde of God. Thankes be vnto god the nobilitie, otherwyse is very well broughte vp in learnynge and godlines, to the great ioye and comfort of England, so that there is nowe good hope in the youth, that we shal an other day haue a florishyng co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mon wealth, consideryng theyr godlye educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. Yea, &amp; there be al ready no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men ynoughe though not so many as I woulde wyshe able
<pb facs="tcp:8744:18"/>
to be Lorde presidentes, and wise menne inough, for the mynt. And as vnmeete a thynge it is for bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes to be Lorde presidentes or priestes to be mynters, as it was for the Corthinthyans to pleade matters of variaunce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore heathen Judges. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so a sclaunder to the noble men, as thoughe they lacked wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and learnyng to be able for suche offyces, or elles were no men of conscience, or els were not meete to be trusted, and able for suche offyces. And a prelate hath a charge &amp; cure otherwyse, and therfore he cannot discharge his duetie, and be a Lorde presy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to. For a presidentshippe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth a whole man, and a by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppe can not be two menne. A bishoppe hath his offyce, a flock to teache, to loke vnto, and there
<pb facs="tcp:8744:19"/>
for he can not meddle wyth an other offece, whiche alone requy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth a whole man. He should ther<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore geue it ouer to whome it is meete, and laboure in his owne busynesse, as Paule wryteth to the Thessalonians. Lette euery man do his owne busynes, and folow his callyng. Let the priest preache, and the noble men han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the temporal matters. Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses was a meruailous manne, a good man. Moyses was a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful felowe, and did his duetye being a maryed man. We lacke suche as Moyses was. Well, I woulde all menne would loke to their dutie, as God hath called them, and then we shoulde haue a florishyng christyan commune weale. And nowe I woulde aske a straunge question. Who is the most diligente bishoppe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<pb facs="tcp:8744:19"/>
in all England, that passeth all the reste in doynge his office I can tell, for I knowe him who it is, I knowe hym well. But nowe I thynke I se you listyng and harkening, that I shoulde name hym. There is one that passeth all the other, and is the moste diligent prelate &amp; preacher in al England. And wil ye know who it is? I wyll tell you. It is the Deuyll. He is the moste dily<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent preacher of all other, he is neuer out of his dioces, he is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer from his cure, ye shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer fynde hym vnoccupyed, he is euer in his patishe, he keepeth resydence at all tymes, ye shal ne<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>uer fynde hym oute of the way, call for hym when you will, he is euer at home, the dilygenteste preacher in all the realme, he is euer at his ploughe, no lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge
<pb facs="tcp:8744:20"/>
nor loyteryng canne hyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der hym, he is euer appliynge his busynes, ye shal neuer fynde hym idle I warraunte you. And his office is to hynder religyon, to mayntayne supersticion, to set vp Idolatrie, to teache al kynd of poperye. He is readye as can be wyshed, for to sette forth his ploughe, to deuyse as manye wayes as can be, to deface and obscure Goddes glorye. Where the Deuyl is resydente and hath his ploughe goyng: there away with bookes, and vp with can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delles, awaye with Bybles and vp with beades, awaye with the lyghte of the gospel, and vp with the lyghte of candelles, yea at noone dayes.

            <p>And when he had once broughte Christe to the crosse, he thoughte all cocke sure. But there loste he all his reygning, for Christ sayed Omnia traham ad meipsum. I wyll

He mente by hys owne sacryfyce on the crosse, wheare he offered him self for the redempcion of mankynd, and not the sacrifice of the masse to be offered by an other. For who can offer him, but him selfe? He was bothe the offerer and the offeryng. And this is the prycke, thys is the marke at the whyche the Deuyll shooteth, to euacuate the crosse of Chryste, and to min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle the instytucion of the Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des supper, the whiche although he canne not brynge to passe: yet he goeth aboute by his sleightes and subtyle meanes, to frustrate the same, and these fyftene hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreth

yeres he hath been a dooer, onelye purposynge to euacuate Christes death, and to make it of smal efficacitie and vertue.</p>
            <p>For where as Christe accordyng as the serpente was lyfte vp in wyldernesse: so woulde he hym selfe to be exalted, that thereby as manye as trusted in hym, shoulde haue saluacion. But the deuyl would none of that. They would haue vs saued by a daily oblacion propiciatorie, by a sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifyce expiatorie, or remissorie.</p>
            <p>Nowe yf I shoulde preache in the countrey amonge the vnlear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, I woulde tell what propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatorie, expiatorie and remisso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie is: but here is a learned au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditorie. Yet for them that be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned I wil expound it. Propi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ciatorie, expiatorie, remissorie, or satisfactorie, for they signifie al
<pb facs="tcp:8744:24"/>
one thynge in effecte, and is no thynge elles but a thynge wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to obteyne remissyon of syn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, and to haue saluacion. And thys waye the Deuyll vsed to euacuate the deathe of Chryste, that we myghte haue affyaunce in other thynges, as in the day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye sacrifice of the pryeste, where as Chryste woulde haue vs to truste in his onelye sacrifice. So he was Agnus occisus ab origine mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di, the lambe that hathe be slaine frome the beginnyng of the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lde, and therfore he is called, Juge sacrificium. A continuall sacrifyce, and not for the continuaunce of the Masse as the blau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>chers haue blaunched it, and wrested it. And as I my selfe dyd once mystake it. But Paule sayeth. Per semetip sum purgatio facta, by him selfe &amp; by
<pb facs="tcp:8744:24"/>
none other, Christ made pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacion and satysfaction for the whole worlde. Woulde Christ this woorde (by hym selfe) hadde been better weyghed and loked vpon, and, In sanctificacionem, to make theym holye, for he is, Juge sacrificium, a continuall sacryfice, in effecte, fruite and operacion, that lyke as they whiche seeyng the serpente hange vp in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serte were put in remembraunce of Christes death, in whome as many as beleued were saued: so all men that trusted in the deathe of Christ shall be saued, as wel they that were before, as they that came after. For he was a contynuall Sacrifyce, as I sayed in effecte, fruite, operaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and vertue. As thoughe he had frome the beginnyng of the world and continually should to
<pb facs="tcp:8744:25"/>
the worldes ende hange still on the crosse, and he is as freshe han<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gyng on the crosse nowe to them that beleue and truste in hym, as he was fiftene hundreth yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res a go when he was crucy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyed. Then lette vs truste vpon hys onely deathe, and looke for none other sacrifyce propiciato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, then the same bloudye sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, the liuelye sacrifice, and not a drie sacrifice, but a blouddy sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice. For Chryste hymselfe sayed, <hi>Consummatum est.</hi> It is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectlye finyshed. I haue taken at my fathers hande the dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of redemyng mankynd.</p>
            <p>I haue wroughte mannes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempcion, and haue dyspatched the matter. Why then myngle ye hym? why do ye deuide hym? why make you of hym mo sacry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fyces then one? Paule sayeth.
<pb facs="tcp:8744:25"/>
               <hi>Pascha nostrum immolatus est Christus</hi> Christe our passeouer is offered vp, so that the thing is done, and Christ hath done it, and he hath done it, <hi>semel.</hi> Once for all. And it was a bloudy sacrifice, not a drie sacrifice.</p>
            <p>Why then, it is not the Masse that auaileth or profiteth for the quicke and the dead? Wo worth thee, O Deuyll, wo worth thee, that haste preuayled so farre and so longe, that thou haste made Englande to worshyppe false Goddes, forsaking Christe their Lorde. Wo worthe the Deuil. Wo worth thee Deuyll and all thyne Aungels: yf Christ by his deathe draweth all thynges to him selfe, and draweth al men to saluacion, and to heauenly blysse that trust in him. Then the prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stes at the Masse, at the popyshe
<pb facs="tcp:8744:26"/>
Masse I say) what ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they draw when Christe draweth all, but landes and gooddes frome the right heyres? The priestes draw gooddes and rychesse, benefyces and promocions to theym selues and suche as beleued in theyr sacrifyce they drawe to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll. But Christe it is that dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth sowles vnto hym by hys bloudy sacrifice. What haue we to do then, but <hi>Epulari in domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uo,</hi> to eate in the Lorde at hys Supper. What other seruyce haue we to do to hym? and what other sacrifyce haue we to offer: but the mortificacio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our flesh? What other oblacion haue we to make, but of obedyence, of good liuynge, of good woorkes, and of healpynge oure neygh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? But as for oure redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, it is done already, it can not
<pb facs="tcp:8744:26"/>
be better. Christe hath done that thynge so well, that it can not be amended. It cannot be deuised howe to make that, any better then he hathe done it. But the Deuyll by the healpe of that J<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talian Bishop yonder, his chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layne: hath laboured by all mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, that he myght, to frustrate the death of Christe, and the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rytes of hys passyon. And they haue deuised for that purpose to make vs beleue in other vayne thynges by his pardonnes, as to haue remission of sinnes for prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ynge on hallowed beades, for drinkyng of the bakehouse bole, as a Channon of Waltam Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey, once tolde me, that when so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer they putte theyr loaues of breade into the ouen, as manye as drancke of the pardon bolle shoulde haue pardon for drinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kynge
<pb facs="tcp:8744:27"/>
of it. A madde thyng to geue pardon to a bolle. Then to Pope Alexanders holye water, to halowed belles, palmes, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delles, asshes, and what not?</p>
            <p>And of these thynges euerye one hath taken awaye some parte of Christes sanctificacion. Euery one hathe tobbed some parte of Christes passion and crosse, and hathe myngled Christes death, and hath been made to be propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciatorie and satisfactorie, and to put awaye sinne. Yea and Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anders holye water yet at thys daye remaynethe in Englande, and is vsed for a remedy against spirytes, and to chase awaye de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uylles, yea and I woulde thys had been the worste. I would thys were the worste. But wo worth thee, O deuyll that haste preuayled to euacuate, Chrystes
<pb facs="tcp:8744:27"/>
crosse and to myngle the lordes supper. These be the Italian by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes deuyces, and the deuyll hathe prycked at thys marke to frustrate the crosse of Christe. He shotte at thys marke longe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christe came, he shotte at this pricke fowre thousande yea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res before Christ hanged on the crosse, or suffered his passion.</p>
            <p>For the brasen serpente, was sette vp in the wyldernes to put men in remembrance of Christes com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>myng, that lyke as they whiche behelde the brasen serpente were healed of their bodilye diseases: so they that loked spirituallye v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Christe that was to come, in hym shoulde be saued spiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Deuyll, The serpent was set vp in memorie of Christe to come, but the Deuyll founde meanes to steale awaye the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morie
<pb facs="tcp:8744:28"/>
of Christes commyng and brought the people to worshippe the Serpenre selfe, and to sence hym, to honoure hym, and to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to hym, to worshyppe hym, and to make an Idoll of hym. And thys was done by the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kette menne that I tolde you of And the clarke of the markette dyd it for the lucre and aduaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his maister, that thereby his honour myghte encrease, for by Christes death, he could haue but small worldlye aduauntage. And euen nowe so hath he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne blaunchers longyng to the markette, to lette and stoppe the lyghte of the Gospel, and to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the kynges procedynges in settyng forth the word and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rye of God. And when the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges maiestie with the aduyse of his honourable counsayle goeth
<pb facs="tcp:8744:28"/>
about to promote Goddes word and to sette an order in matters of religyon there shall not lacke blaunchers that wyl saye. As for Images wheras they haue been vsed to be senced, and to haue candels offred vnto theim: none be so folishe to do it to the stocke or stone, or to the Image selfe, but it is done to GOD and his honour before the Image. And thoughe they shoulde abuse it, these blaunchers will be ready to whysper the Kynge in the eare, and to tell hym that this abuse is but a small matter. And that the same wyth all other lyke a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buses in the churche maye be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourmed easilye. It is but a litle abuse (say they) and it maye bee easily amended. But it shoulde not be taken in hande at the first for feare of trouble, or further
<pb facs="tcp:8744:29"/>
inconueniences. The people wil not beare sod ayne alteracions an insurreccyon maye be made after sodayne mutacion, whiche maye be to the greate harme and loste of the realme. Therefore all thynges shal be wel, but not out of hand, for feare of further bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>synes. These be y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> blanchers that hitherto haue stopped the worde of god, and hindered the true set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyng forth of the same. There be so many put offes, so manye put byes, so many respectes, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideracio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s of worldly wisdo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. And I dout not but there were blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in the olde time, to whysper in the eare of good kynge Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chyas, for the mayntenaunce of Idolatrie done to the brasen ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, aswel as there hath ben now of late, &amp; be now that can blanche the abuse of Images and other
<pb facs="tcp:8744:29"/>
lyke thynges. But good kynge Ezechias woulde not be so blyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, he was lyke to Apollos, fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent in spiryte. He woulde geue no eare to the blanchers, he was not moued wyth these worldlye respectes, wyth these prudente consyderacions, with these poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, he feared not insurreccions of the people. He feared not least his people woulde not beare the glorye of God: but he (without any of these respectes, or poly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sideracions, like a good kynge for Goddes sake, and for conscience sake) by &amp; by plucked downe the brasen serpente, and destroyed it vtterlye, and beat it to pouder. He oute of hande, dyd caste downe all Images, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed all Idolatrie, and clerely dyd extirpate all supersticion. He woulde not heare these blanchers
<pb facs="tcp:8744:30"/>
and worldly wyse men, but with out delaye, foloweth gods cause and destroyeth all Idolatrie out of hande. Thus dyd good king Ezechias, for he was lyke Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo, ferue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t in spirite, and dilygente to promote Goddes glorie. And good hope there is that it shall be lykewyse here in Englande, for the kynges Maiestye is so broughte vp in knowledge, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and godlynesse, that it is not to be mystrusted, but that we shall haue all thynges well, and that the glorye of God shall be spred abrode, throughout al par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes of the realme, yf the prelates wil dilige<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tly apply their plough &amp; be preachers, rather then Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, but our blaunchers, whiche wyll be Lordes, and no labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, when they are commaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to go and be resydente vpon
<pb facs="tcp:8744:30"/>
their cures, and preache in theyr benefyces, they would say.</p>
            <p>What, I haue sette a deputie there, I haue a deputie that lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth well to my flocke, and the whiche shal discharge my duetie. A deputie quod he. I loked for that worde all this whyle. And what a deputie must he be, trowe ye? Euen one lyke hym selfe, it muste be a cannoniste, that is to saye, one that is broughte up in the studie of the Popes lawes &amp; decrees. One that wyll set forth papistrie as well as hym self wyl do, and one that wyll mayntayne all supersticion, and Idolatrye. And one that wyll nothynge at all, or els very weakely resist the Deuyls plough, yea happy it is yf he take not part with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyll, and where he shoulde be an enemy to hym, it is wel if he take
<pb facs="tcp:8744:31"/>
not the Deuilles parte agaynste Christe. But in the meane time the Prelares take theyr plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures. They are Lordes and no labourers, but the Deuill is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lygente at his ploughe. He is no vnpreachynge prelate. He is no Lordelye loyterer from his cure, but a busie ploughe man, so that amonhe all the prelates, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monge al the packe of them that haue cure, the Deuill shal go for my money. For he styll applyeth his busynes. Therefore ye vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preachynge prelates, learne of the deuill to be diligent in doyng of your offyce.
