            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT <hi>MAIESTIE.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Ost Gracious and most sacred Soueraigne, It is not without diuers reasons, that I haue not boldly made a Dedication to your Maiestie, of this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise put foorth for the good of your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties subiects, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing so much neede to be strongly armed, now, while as (like vnto a weake Barke vpon a raging sea) it entereth on the Theater of the World, to speake of the peace and vnion of the holy Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, amidst so many furious Giants of contradiction as are now in the Church of God: This heauenly voice of Christian harmony hath neuer bin heard, but followed with a malignant <hi>Echo</hi> of proud and vehement Spirits, <hi>qui pascuntur syllogismo sicut boues feno,</hi> who delight to feed vpon Disputes as Oxen
<pb facs="tcp:4124:3"/>
on hay, in such a desperate Paroxisme, that they will not lose the reputation of one crooked syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisme for the peace of whole Christendome, yet the world doth neuer want some <hi>Phaenix,</hi> who is content to burne her earthly fame to ashes, in that pure fire of Christian loue, to bring foorth some seedes of peace: So that I do expect no other, but to heare my cries contumeliouslie re-echoed, that my conceptions of the reconciliation of Rome shal be esteemed not only Paradoxall but smelling of atheisme, and that my proiects for perfect vnitie in matter of Ecclesiasticall policie and ceremonies within your Maiesties kingdomes, shalbe said to be a craftie and cunning preparation for superstition to re-enter into the Church, of which vnchristian oblatration, the first <hi>alarmes</hi> haue been sounded in my eares so hardly, while my Copie was newly deliuered to the presse, that I would haue retired it if I had bin one of those, who liue in the aire of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular applause, as in their naturall element, &amp; who (like to <hi>Narcissus)</hi> will rather die for loue of their owne image, then suffer one blow for so noble a common cause. But when I consider how many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious calumnies our Sauiour and his Apostles did suffer, for plantation of this peace of the Gospell, I hold it a mans truest commendation and comfort, if for the sake of the same he may say with S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, that he fought with beasts in the maner of men.</hi> Seldome is it indeed that goodnes is made the scope of our actions, and in this corrupt age, this vpright vertue of pacification hath neuer bin seen vpon the stage, but waited with an infortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb facs="tcp:4124:3"/>
               <hi>Genius,</hi> wee may witnesse those sweete in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines, of <hi>Cassander,</hi> of <hi>Erasme,</hi> of <hi>Iunius,</hi> of <hi>Paraeus,</hi> of <hi>Causabone,</hi> and other Pacificators: And cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainely I thinke it is a sillie vertue, that for so braue an end, cannot in the conscience of an honest deed, with a sterne countenance out-face a guiltie Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniator, for such a Treatise as this can neuer be altogether fruitlesse, if it were but to giue aire e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for discouering and venting of malicious humors that lurke in ill affected men. And howso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer the matter shall worke, two things did migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily encourage me, first knowing that vnder the godly and gracious Reigne of your Maiestie, in whose eares Moderation and Wisedome do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly dwell, an <hi>Aristides</hi> will be permitted to breath freely without feare of <hi>Ostracisme</hi> or ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment: Next, the priuate testimonies which I haue had of the presence of Gods holy Spirit, to informe and to confirme my conscience, whiles I did labour about these, do giue me great hope that they shall haue sufficient auctoritie with good men, to purge me from these vglie and odious as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>persions. And therefore, for the first I did rather chuse to betake my selfe to the candor and nobility of my cause, &amp; to the patience of those benigne and blessed Spirits, who haue mooued before me this diuine argument, <hi>de amahili Ecclesiaconcordia,</hi> then presumptuously to thrust in your Maiesties bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some my hazardous endeauours, the chiesest pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection whereof must be, to be acceptable of God, whiles they are vngracious to men. Alurements to Chatholike pacification, Inducements to absolute
<pb facs="tcp:4124:4"/>
vnitie within the Church of this Ile, Defence of the Orthodoxall policy of the Church gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Apologie of the most lawfull authoritie of my soueraigne Prince, Perswasions to so worthy and so deare a Nobleman, to vendicate himselfe from the bondage of Idolatry, and such like sacred theames as be treated heere, are able to preserue my reputation from blemish or suspition, vnlesse that Archiecalumniator the Iesuite doe edge his bloody pen against me, who seeing hee doth not spare to bend his murthering tongue against your Maiestie, who is the Mirror and Miracle of the world, his malediction or malscription can procure nothing but glory to such as I am. The second rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of my non dedication to your Maiesty is, that, although, it be <hi>ingens materia, superba inscriptio,</hi> a most stately and glorious subiect, to write of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian harmony, yet it commeth in my hands, as an excellent Lute to vnskilfull fingers, in which res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect I knew my paines to be vnworthy of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty, as also by reason of my base and humble stile, which flieth low, <hi>inter aues palustres,</hi> and is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of those Aquiline penns, which can soare neer vnto the Sunne. Thirdly, I did not wish that any peintured dedication to your Maiesty should hide the true face of my labours, and make that to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steened mercenary which is most sincere. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the whole treatise it selfe is no other then a sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of my deuotion to your Maiesties seruice, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisting of the most cleane and costly peeces, that I could chuse to offer, all tending to perswade your Maiesties people, that the prosperity of the Church
<pb facs="tcp:4124:4"/>
and the felicity of this kingdome haue no sure fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament now, but such a firme coniunction, as doth reserue, no sparkle, color, nor pretext of seperation hereafter. If that Great King out of the conscience of his Tyrannie and proud ambition did say in his time, that he was none of his, who did not fauour the Monarch asmuch as <hi>Alexander,</hi> how much more need haue Princes now adaies, that we should all insinuate, vrge, write, preach and crie, that he is not an vpright Subiect, who doth not loue both the Royall person and the Royall Maiestie, in these dangerous times; while as a spirituall ambition hath so poysoned the soules of men by this <hi>Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mique</hi> Theologie of the Iesuite, who presumeth, as it were to Metamorphose nature, and superinduce a new face vpon the World, spiritualising the grounds of State, and temporalising the condition of Religion, making Popes absolute ouer Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narches, and vsing Kings like to the Shepheards dogs, who are beaten and chased away, when they are not vigilant and barking to his pleasure; that it is to be feared, lest in time (if the oppositions were wanting which are made by your Maiesty) the iudgements of men should become <hi>Pyrrhonicall</hi> and <hi>Problematicall,</hi> as if there were no truth in things but all were indifferent, as if it should be as easie for them, hauing once subiugat the temporall power to the spirituall, to refine S. <hi>Peter</hi> and by a new Alembication to make him Monarchall Priest and Monarchall Prince ouer the whole vniuerse: And seeing this discourse containeth a discouerie of those abominable maximes, which Hell it selfe
<pb facs="tcp:4124:5"/>
hath vomited to prepare the spirits of men to shake off the diuine yoke chiefly of your Maiesty, Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imes (alas for pity) whereof when we consider the deplorable euents, that partly haue come to passe, and partly haue been shot at, what <hi>Clements,</hi> what <hi>Chastels,</hi> what <hi>Rauilliacks,</hi> what pouder Traitors, they can neuer be sufficiently charactered, but with teares of blood: These I hope will suffice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Dedicatory intercession to make your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties eyes propitious and fauourable ouer my faithfull sacrifice of peace and vnity, that none of these Rauenous foules shall haue any power to spoile it, or to trouble my oblation; And lastly since by your Maiesties Gracious permission, I am to publish these, for a triall, of what true Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and true wisedome is in the hearts of your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties Subiects, I haue not neither sent them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, but presidiat with the fauours of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and vertuous Prelate whom your Maiestie hath worthily preferred to be the chiefest <hi>Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> and Pilate in the shippe of the Church. God grant in his mercy, that they may teach your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties people, to draw their light from no other Sunne but from your Maiestie, and that they haue nothing before their eyes, but Gods true worship, the glory of this great and fortunate Ile, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of your Maiesties person and crowne, and the stability of your most Royall succession.</p>

And sithence, my Lord, this Treatise hath already found an easie accesse vnto your <hi>GRACE</hi> and so benigne acceptation, that your Grace haue not onely set ouer it a censorious and skilfull Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueyor, but haue been content to heare diuers points of the same agited before your selfe, notwithstanding of the most weightie and assiduous businesse, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with I did see you to bee pressed. For this respect amongst many others, I doe not see where it can finde a surer passe to goe abroad, then in the trust of your protection, nor where it can more iustly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund the same then from your Grace, whose pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storall vigilance doth well approoue that Royall wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome which did preferre you to bee the principall Watchman of this Church, and to carrie the touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone, for tryall of all such peeces as should bee offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Lords Sanctuarie: whose extraordinarie Exaltation in the house of God, to be, from no Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Primat of England <hi>ante annum vertentem aut circiter,</hi> doth testifie that the great Spirit which alwaies ruleth his <hi>Maiestie</hi> our <hi>most Gracious So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne,</hi> hath breathed vpon your Election, that you should bee <hi>tanquam Sol refulgens in Templo altissimi,</hi> a bright starre of his Church, and a conspicuous marke of his extraordinarie grace vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safed vpon this great Kingdome, I say extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, for if the Papall Bishops while they doe impugne the truth of Gods word forbidding marriage to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorise the doctrine of their coelibat, they do not the lesse contaminate the same with lewd and open pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, and your Grace all in contrarie, while you
<pb facs="tcp:4124:7"/>
doe stand for the Euangelicall libertie of Matrima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie, you doe in the meane time by the puritie of your life, practise the perfection of the cloysterrall Caelibat, taking vnto you that religious word of the more innocent and vertuous ages, <hi>Si placet licet:</hi> I thinke it is a cleere mirrour, wherein the world may see that it is the good spirit of God, who doeth freely distribute his extraordinarie giftes to such faithfull Prelates as worship him according to the trueth of his word: and that no vsurped authoritie of Popish or humane traditions can doe so much. And since there is no better meanes to make your <hi>GRACES</hi> Excellent and spirituall partes <hi>tanquam Thus redolens in Templo Domini,</hi> (as was said of that worthie Priest <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Onia)</hi> to smell as a sweete perfume in the <hi>LORDS</hi> house, then by continuing your delight to cherish the studie of vertue where it is found in the most remote partes of the land, which is indeede a sauorie presage of that perfect vnitie which God doeth dispose to bee in the whole Church of the same.</p>
            <p>Therefore let it please your <hi>GRACE</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue these first and tender Seedes of my pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Seruice to God, to my most Sacred So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne <hi>PRINCE,</hi> and to this Common-wealth, whereof you are the first vitall member, and so to nourish them by the kindly ayre of your ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous spirit, that they may bee found to produce a happie fruite, that is to say, a fruite which hath

               <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>Hristian and curteous Reader, this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise which I haue framed for the glory of God, the comfort of his Church, and the seruice of this common-weale, wherein wee liue, why it is Intituled, <hi>A vision of Balaams Asse,</hi> you may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue in the entry thereof. It containeth in speciall these three, First the cause of my voluntary recantation of Popery, Secondly a cleere discouery of the tyranny of Rome, mounted in our time to her Meridian or Altitude; And of the treacherous trade and doctrine of the Iesuite, who doth falsly maintaine the Papall Soueraigntie tending to the ouerthrow of Christian Princes and states: Thirdly, a discourse of the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant approach of her reformation or downefall, and of the probable meanes, whereby the Lord God doth dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the restitution of Christian people from the spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all captiuity of this Babel, with a sincere exhortation to you to honour aswell the meanes, as the instruments, whom God doth pointforth for the aduancement of this great worke, as you haue them here set downe in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: In the which exhortation if any thing be, that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the suddaine seemeth distastfull to you, I do entreate you that you will not for that rashly reiect it, but do taste it againe and againe, remembring how oftentimes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gusts do grow rather by the distemper of our sence, then by any fault which is in our meats: As a diseased person must for the sake of his health controle his naturall appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, and as nature in generall (who seldome doth erre) by offering violence vnto her particular members for
<pb facs="tcp:4124:9"/>
her common benefite, doth proue a good Physitian to her selfe: So if wee cannot straine our priuate humours for a publike weale, wee are senselesse and cauterized members of the commonweale, and our diseases when they come they shall be desperate and deadly: It was a worthy saying of him who spake so, <hi>Omnis magna lex ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bet aliquid iniquitatis,</hi> that euery great law had something of iniquitie in it, not that any expresse iniustice was in the law, but because when so many liue within their own Spheares, onely to themselues, without respect to the commonwealth, it is impossible to establish any great law, which shall not bring displeasure to those particular members, whose actions are not ruled by common equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, common reason, or common good. If we doe grudge against our lawes, or our lawgiuers, because they are not pleasant to our peculiar taste, we be farre inferiour in true vertue to the Ethnicks, who thought it the chiefest mark of their vertuous mind, and their greatest glory, to remit proper losses, proper grudges, and proper opinions to the common wealth. The precise <hi>Cato Vticensis,</hi> who might haue brooked the first dignities vnder <hi>Iulius Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sar,</hi> because it was not to his mind, he chose rather to die then to liue distracted in opinion from the state: That vpright Philosopher <hi>Socrates</hi> hauing in his choice to be banished or to die, he embraced death, saying that a man cast off from his common wealth, was no more a man. Is it not strange then amongst vs, in whom that obscure light of nature (which onely did guide them) is made ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lestiall, by the diuine splendor of Gods reuealed word; to see that a Christian Pastor, before he will quit singula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of opinion, and singularity of name to our common wealth spirituall, to the peace and credit of our Church, conforming himselfe to orthodoxall lawes, established by the authoritie of a most Christian Prince, a setled Church and well gouerned state, he will first choose ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to liue at home a seditious tribune, <hi>In perpetuo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strepit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Certainely where there is no perfect vnitie, there can be no perfect peace nor perfect loue, and consequently no Church, because these are the whole scope of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell and of all true Religion: Vnanimitie is the bond which maketh the Church strong, <hi>Ecce circumdedi te</hi>

            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>Y very NOBLE LORD, it is certain that Christian faith and Christian virtue goe inse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable together, that is the tree, and these are the fruit, and where wee see not plenty of these, it is an argument of the Tree decaying: So that our greatest happines in this world, consists in our constant action of Christian workes: howsoeuer our eternall felicitie is chiefely contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet our contemplatiue life here vpon earth (euen where it is most syncere) doth but resemble. Alpestre and mountanous grounds, which be stately but barren, compared with the fruitfull Valleyes of the virtuous actiue life, properly obserued by that famous Doctor, <hi>Greg. Mag:</hi> in his Allegorie vpon the double wiues of Iacob, <hi>Rachael videns &amp; pulchra, sed sterilis, Lea lippa sed
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:4124:14"/>
faecunda.</hi> Among vertues it hath euer carried a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to trauell abroad, for increase of knowledge to enter vpon the chiefest stages of the world, to see aboue the vulgar reach; and as the good Merchants ship, to bring precious wares from farre Countries, or like the industrious Bee, to sucke the hony of true wisdome from the rarest herbes of experience, the varieties whereof are best found in Trauelling. As the Scripture saith in <hi>Eccles.</hi> He who would apply his minde to the meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods Law, he shal trauell through strange Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where he may try the good and euill among men, and when the great God will, he shall be filled with the spirit of vnderstanding, that he may poure out wise sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentences, which is the reason why in men who haue tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled, we doe looke commonly for some accession of knowledge: for that cause it is, that I, who also among others, haue brought the eyes of people vpon me in this kind of expectation, doe find my selfe bound by some vertuous discharge, to iustifie my peregrination beyond Seas, esteemed by many in that season of my age, and in so meane a state as I doe possesse, to haue beene vntime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, temerary, perillous, and vnprofitable. And which hath beene most vildely calumniated by diuers of your Lordships profession, among whom, a certaine one of good worth did, as I was enformed, giue this iudgement of me, that I had gone abroad the voyage of King <hi>Saul,</hi> to bring home my Fathers Asses, which bitter insectation, with many such like tempests of mens tongues, I haue sithence (like a true and vpright Asse) borne foorth with no other armour, then pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, vntill now being curious in what sort I might best pay this expectation of good men, and best emancipate my selfe from this persecution of malignant mouthes, I haue chosen, to assay if I can inspire into erroneous mindes, specially into your Lordship, some disposition to better opinions in this time of your so great exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and necessitie you stand in to resolue. First, the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:4124:14"/>
vniuersall and seruent desires of our Countrey, euen from his Maiestie, our most <hi>gracious Soueraigne,</hi> to the beggar, to see your Lo: reduced to a saithfull sympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and communion with the rest, being otherwaies so noble a member of this kingdome, as you are, <hi>tam gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uis, &amp; constans, tamque bonarum partium in Rempublicam,</hi> this doth make it a good seruice to God and to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon wealth: secondly, the great honour and dutie which I owe to your Lordship, for the great honour which I haue by you, to be sprung from that ancient and famous bloud of your house, doth infinitely tye mee to this endeauour, who (if I were a meere stranger to your Lordship) must yet thinke it my honour to be sufficient for your seruice: thirdly, the opportunity which I haue by this publike discharge to render vnto the world an ingenious accompt of my selfe, it doth conioyne with these a priuate respect of mine owne</p>
            <p>So it is that the Prelates and Preachers of Gods word who bring in their mouthes the medicine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian soules, they cannot moue your Lo: nor enter vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your minde, so haue you intrenched the same within the common subterfuges of vniuersality, Antiquitie, and succession of the Church: of insufficiency of the holy Scripture, of authority of humane supplement and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and while you are brought to the Fathers, now quarelling the edition of bookes, and now againe, beta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king your selfe to your <hi>Implieita fides,</hi> like vnto that Marriner who hauing lost his loadestarre in a darke night, he wandereth, but knoweth not his course. The <hi>Israelites</hi> had no other guid through the deserts then the pillar of fire which was in the cloude, who once looseth the cleere light of the Euangel, which is a bright starre placed to conduct vs, through the wildernesse of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane wisdome, he shall neuer finde out his right course into the land of holinesse: And whiles your Lordship remaines thus inflexible against so many learned and graue <hi>Diuines,</hi> It would (like enough) be thought pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumption,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:4124:15"/>
and arrogancie in me to deale with you, if the spirit of God did not testifie that in great workes the helpe of weake instruments is not to be despised. When <hi>Mosci</hi> builded the Tabernacle of God, there came vnto him not onely all the wise men, to whom the Lord gaue wisdome saith the text, <hi>Sed quemcunque etiam extulerat animus vt adid opus accederet,</hi> but euen euery man whose heart did encourage him to furder that businesse. The voice of a goose did once preserue the Capitol of <hi>Rome,</hi> I confesse I haue gotten no more of Theologie, then serueth for my owne prouision, yet who knowes, but by my dealing it may fall foorth to your Lordship which hath happened to numbers of diseased persons, who hauing spent much time and much money among the Physicians, and neuer a whit recouered, they haue in end by good fortune attained vnto their health, by hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring some trauelling beggar relate, that which hath been done to himselfe, or to some other man in such a case; euen so, I being no Physitian, but bringing some Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piricall, medicine to your Lordship, who haue renounced your physitians; I may possibly, (as God grant it proue so) doe some good to you, by a faithfull narration of that, which in the like disease hath befallen vnto my selfe and of the chiefe things which hath bread to mee distaste of the Church of Rome, after I had so diligently and painefully considered the same.</p>
            <p>But before I will enter into this discourse Empiricall, or of exeperience, my conscience doth moue me to say, this by the way, of the authority and power of Gods blessed word, that as it would be reputed a strange dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and ignorance in nature, not to preferre those physitians who knowing the right simples, vse no medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caments, vnto those others who flying the simples, and practising by filthy and composed drugges doe more often prooue murtherers then Physitians: Euen so in spirituall eures, what a pitie is it, that your Lo: should thinke the Preachers of Gods word (who minister no

And first, I shew it from this argument <hi>a Contrarijs,</hi> In the Scripture wee finde mention onely of two beastes to whome God did allotte the faculty of speaking, the Serpent, and the Asse, the Serpent opened his mouth to suborne impietie and rebellion against God, the Asse opened his mouth, to reprehend sinne in the Prophet. Therefore seeing it was said that the Serpent was the worst of the beasts, <hi>neque erat caput nequius super caput Calubri,</hi> it must bee a iust consequence, that the Asse is the best, and most simple of beasts, and most excellent for naturall goodnesse. That by the Asse was signified Gods people appeareth by sundry places in holy Scriptures; when Saul was diuers times comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by <hi>Samuel</hi> to returne home and receiue the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, he answered him still that hee did seeke his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Asses, till at length the Prophet told him the As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses were found, mystically meaning (as diuers learned authors doe intepret) the people, who as Asses) were to vnderlie the yoke of his obedience, as they haue also ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded that other place of the Asse, when our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our going vp to Ierusalem commanded his Disciples saying, <hi>Inueniet is afinam alligatam &amp; pullum cum ea soluite</hi>

            <argument>
               <p>A Discourse of our naturall light and diuine instinct of our Conscience. A true definition of Idolatry for the better triall of superstitious worship, and preuarication in Gods seruice.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>THe Scripture records that the Asse of <hi>Balaam</hi> went on a pace before he did see the Angel, and that the Angel was diuers times seene before obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was done vnto him: so was it with mee all the while of my being in <hi>France,</hi> I did professe the Popish Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and as sincerely obey the discipline of that Church, as any man could doe of my weakenesse, and that from vpright zeale, and not from designe, whereof I could my selfe giue many great proofes, which be not pertment here, onely this farre I say, That many times I haue heard in one weeke more then twenty Masses, and that for the greatest part there, where I knew no man, nor yet was knowne my selfe of any: Whereof also your Lo; selfe may beare witnesse by diuers of my Letters written to you in those times, chiefly by one, (if it please you to remember) from <hi>Paris</hi> immediatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my going into <hi>Italy,</hi> in the which I did play the Paranymphe to my selfe, by praising the resolution of my comming foorth, from the example of <hi>Abrahams</hi> calling, who was comanded by God to goe forth of his owne Country that he might worship the Lord truely, and he blessed of him in a strange land: In such sort, that for the time, I could haue been content to remaine a <hi>Transfuga</hi> to my liues end. In this Letter I did allude to the greater light of the Southerne Sunne, and to the Aquilonar darkenesse founded vpon that Thalmudicall fable which we read in the writs of <hi>Rabbi Eleazer,</hi> in his
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:4124:22"/>
booke called <hi>Zoar,</hi> that in the creation of the heauens, God did leaue a hole in the Northerne parts thereof, that in the beginning the Sunne had his first point of motion in the Southeast, that about <hi>Damascus</hi> in the Southeast, God tooke that <hi>Terra virgo,</hi> that most perfect <hi>Earth,</hi> whereof he formed <hi>Adam,</hi> that the garden of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and mount Sion, were planted in the South-east, that God chose the Patriarckes and his peculiar people in the South-east, remote significations of Gods truth to remaine for euer in the Climats of the Southeast, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that in the Canticles <hi>Vbi habitabit dilectus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>? in meridie: vbicubabit? in meridie.</hi> And that the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne parts of the earth were the seate, naturally, of darkenesse and iniquity, as being subiect to the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect parts of the heauen, and to the aforesaid hole where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Lucifer and his companions did fall, according to that vision of the Prophet, who heard him saying, <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debo in montibus Aquilonis, &amp; fimilis ero altissimo:</hi> allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging this Scripture, <hi>Omne malum pandetur ab Aquilone,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ierem. 10.</note> and the text of <hi>Moses</hi> of the seuen Candlestickes of the Arke looking from the North towards the South: as if the North were, <hi>sinistra Mundi,</hi> and the proper habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of vncleane spirits, like as we see the <hi>Aquilo</hi> to be a tempesteous and destroying winde, whereas by the wholesome and nourishing <hi>Auster,</hi> is meant, the sweete and peaceable spirit of God, incalled in the Canticles, <hi>Ueni Auster &amp; perfla hortum meum:</hi> And whereof <hi>Aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuc</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Cant. 4.</note> saith, <hi>Deus ab Austro veniet.</hi> So that the seuen Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlestickes looking to the South, were signes of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity of the spirituall light there, neuer to bee extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished by any tempest of Northerne heresies. These and such like fond fantasies which were then infused in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to mee, and which haue beene inuented by curious braines to poyson simple wits, did I introduce in that Letter.</p>
            <p>And they were arguments good enough, both of my zeale, and of my ignorance, as if the garden of Eden,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:4124:22"/>
were not many thousands of yeeres agoe depriued of true light, and consumed with the fire of Gods wrath, as if that holy mount Sion, and that mother City Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, who had fairer promises of perpetultie made by God, then Rome, and all the Cities in the world, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause shee was (like vnto <hi>Na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:4124:23"/>
glorie of the precessions, their exorbitant workes of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Charitie, multitudes of Hospitals; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uentuall houses, rented by voluntarie Contributions, the stoicall and stupid austeritie of the Proselites, the voluntary miserie of the Capuchins, the profound Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of the Dominicall and Iacobin Orders, the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable policy of the Iesuitical trade; &amp; withal their proud &amp; perillous vaunting of Antiquity, Succession, and Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersality; these are sufficient at the first to surprise a iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious minde, and to astonish a man, as if hee looked on <hi>Medusas</hi> head, who drinketh of Mandragora hee is in danger of a long sleepe, but who tasteth the cup of Superstition, he is in danger of deadly sleepe: That old <hi>Circe</hi> knoweth all the secrets of inchantment; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit she hath amazed Kithing mountaines of dead mens bones, yet of those who arriue in her Island and come within the hearing of her voice, they be few who escape her incantations; fewe who with <hi>Vlisses</hi> can tye them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, vnto the maine Mastes, to the ende they bee not rauished with her Syrens songes, which can keepe fast the sacred, Anker of the pure word of God. Many through ignorance and naturall inclination to supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, many againe through auarice and ambition are contented to be tranformed into beasts by the charmes of <hi>Circe.</hi> This euill of superstition among spiriruall dangers, it is the great rocke of our common shipwrack, it is dangerous first, and especially because of the feareful iudgement which God doth inflict against it: For what is superstition, but a false worship of God. Of all the plagues and punishments vnder heauen, most fearefull is that which followeth superstition, the Prophet hath pronounced it against the obstinate follies of the Iewes, <hi>Audite audientes &amp; nolite intelligere, videte visione<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; nolite cogitare nec cognoscere, occoeca cor populi huius, oculos <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

A certaine great Deuine hath made this the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and good men, <hi>Deus homo coelestis, homo autem Deus terrestris,</hi> but when we be spoiled with wicked ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie, it maketh the Lord to say of vs, <hi>homo cum in honore esset &amp; non intellexit, comparatus est inmentis insipientibus, &amp; factus est similis illis,</hi> and was not indeed that mightie <hi>Nabuchodonozor</hi> for his wrong opinion of God changed into a beast? our other sinnes for the greatest part pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed of humane weakenesse, but this of wicked presump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore it is commonly punished with despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ob<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>uration.</p>
            <p>Secondly, idolatry is dangerous because it is ordinary and quotidian in the world, as euery body hath his owne shadow, so there was neuer Religion which had not his owne superstition: And as the shadow is longer then the body, except when the Sunne approcheth neere the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith, and sendeth his beames downe either perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, or toward a direct aspect vpon the earth as we say: Euen so when the light of the Euangell makes not a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect reflexion vpon our soules and mindes to certifie our knowledge, but comes vpon vs by obliquity, not in puritie but mixed with humane traditions, then growes superstition to be long. An extraordinarie and impious excesse of Religion dissoluing the true order of Gods worship into numbers of forbidden and pharifaicall ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, it is the companion of true Religion: for truth and falsehood are twins borne almost both in one day; God spake to day in Paradise, the Serpent spake next morrow: <hi>Simon Peter</hi> in the Euangell spake to day, and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> spake to morrow: There was neuer Church free from corruption to the end, chiefly from idolatrous worship. <hi>Adam</hi> who was the first man created by God himself, in whose person was the whole Church of God, he fell away to beleeue the Deuill: <hi>Aaron</hi> who was the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:4124:24"/>
first Priest ordained by God himselfe, by a legal warrant, he fell away to idolatrie: <hi>Solomon</hi> who was the first king, and first man commanded by God to build him a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for his seruice, he also fell away to idolatry. These no doubt be great arguments of the force of superstition. Thirdly, idolatry is dangerous because it is a popular dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ease, and so is the more contagious: The Israelites were once become so vniuersally Baalists, that the Prophet cryed, there was not one who had not bowed his knee to <hi>Baal.</hi> The Ecclesiasticall histories doe record that the Catholike Church was so once generally infected with Arianisme, that there was not a sincere Pastor, who durst minister the sacraments of Baptisme in a publike Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Such is the disposition of our corrupt natures to he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resie and preuarication in Gods worship: Nature is mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued and led by the sense, and in idolatrie there be so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny gratious and pleasant shewes of piety as doe bewitch the senses.</p>
            <p>Lastly, superstition is dangerous because the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude who are chiefely giuen vnto it, can hardly discouer it, they be but <hi>pecora campi,</hi> as the wiseman saith in the Scripture: I lookt out vpon the earth, and I saw many beasts but few men: Superstition while it is masked it is a most plausible thing, Satan hath giuen to it a faire face, and oftentimes fairer then that of true Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, after the sort of impudent whores, who be more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riously deckt then the chast Ladies, but when the mask is pulled off, there is nothing more vglie and despisefull for euen as it is a monstrous deformitie, that an Ape being a beast, should resemble a mans face: so superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on well considered, the more it is like to true Religion, the more it is deformed, and because the summe of this discourse shall stand into a consideration of such super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitious abuses and impietie as by experience I did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marke in the Church of Rome. Therefore that your Lo: minde may be the better prepared to ponder iustly my relation, and to discerne what is superstitious and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:4124:24"/>
what is not so, I would first lay down two grounds, which if you finde reason to admit, they may possibly helpe greatly to cleere your Lo: iudgement.</p>
            <p>The first whereof shall be this: As the World was <note place="margin">The Light of nature.</note> neuer in any time without a God to gouerne it, so neuer was it in any age without some diuine law felt by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of man, to render him inexcusable as a great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine saith, <hi>cum sit Deus ab humana intelligentia procul ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sconditus,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Institu. cap. 1.</note> 
               <hi>tamen suae Maiestatis not as adeo claras &amp; illustres singulis suis operibus impressit, vt sublata sit quamlibet coecis &amp; stupidis, omnis ignorantiae excusatio,</hi> for if man had beene confirmed in that grace wherein he was created, he nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded no law, <hi>iusto non est lex posita,</hi> saith the Apostle; But because as God himselfe doth testifie <hi>proni sunt sensus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum ad malum ab adolescentia,</hi> therefore hath God bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled vs by a law, and first by the law of nature which he hath so surely stamped in our soules that it is enough to conuict vs before God: whereof Saint <hi>Iohu</hi> saith in his Gospell, <hi>haec est lux vera illuminans omnem hominem venien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> 
               <hi>in mundum:</hi> The Apostle doth stand for this light, saying the inuisible things of him that is his eternall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer and godhead are seene by the creation of the world, being considered in his worker to the intent they should be without excuse saith he. Of this Light the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> hath said, <hi>multi dicunt quis ostendet nobis bona, signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Psol 4.</note>

                  </gap>,</hi> which ground being conferd with that other of ignorance, maintained in the Popes Church to be the mother of pietie, and of <hi>implicita fides</hi> sufficient for a mans saluation, I know not what harmonie they make. And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> in his booke of controuersies, speaking of iustification and free will, doth reason farthest of any man for this force and light of our conscience: neither hath any wise Ethnicke euer <note place="margin">A discourse of three Lawes.</note> refused it: <hi>Cicero</hi> in his booke <hi>De natura Deorum, nulla est etiam tam barbara natio nulla ge<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:4124:25"/>
this light, and law naturall, that the olde world by euill custome, and by the streame of iniquitie became blinde, esteeming things good and lawfull in nature which were notso, therefore God in his mercie made it more cleere the second time, by giuing vnto <hi>Moses</hi> the written Law, that our knowledge might be again made more inexcuse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> saith, <hi>peccatum non cognouinisipor legem, peccatum sine lege mortuum erat, delitescebat.</hi> And to the end that the world might know what a fearefull thing it <note place="margin">Rom. 1. 10.</note> was to transgresse this law, it was pronounced in a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible sort, as I haue said, till the astonished people were forced to cry, <hi>Ne loquatur Dominus, ne forte mori<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> which was done to breede vnto your hearts a horror of sinne and faith in Gods promises of the Messias, as <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> testifies, <hi>vt terror esset in vobis &amp; non peccetis:</hi> The <note place="margin">Exod. 10.</note> yoak of this law, was so heauy on the one part, &amp; the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of our rebellious nature, so violent on the other part, that euen as great inundations, by their impetuous force, carry away the ramparts &amp; bulwarkes which men haue digged to restrain them, and ouer flowes their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie bankes, euen so those obstinate Iewes by the vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment course of their wicked nature did transgresse and dooborde ouer all the limits of this law, that it had no vse among them but for their conuiction which hath made the Apostle to say, <hi>Lex propter transgressionem posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta est:</hi> till, God out of his pitie did prouide a third law and doctrine, which was the help againe of this, and the finall fulfilling of all Lawes, the law Euangelicall and of Grace: <hi>The Lord Iesus Christ,</hi> beside whom no mortall man hath beene or shalbe able to fulsill a law or to please God. So that we see these three lawes, euery one of them written and as it were indented one in the other, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall first written in the heart of <hi>Adam,</hi> but written ouer againe by fairer letters in the <hi>Mosaicall Tables:</hi> And that againe more cleerely written in the Euangell by exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him who was the perfection of all Lawes. The second doth expound the first, and the third doth both
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:4124:25"/>
expounde and accomplish, the other two like vnto these wheeles seene by Ezechiell in a vision, hauing the one incorporate in the other, euery sinne committed against the law of Nature is also against the <hi>Mosaicall</hi> law, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the <hi>Mosaicall</hi> is included in the Naturall, &amp; what is against the <hi>Mosaical,</hi> is also against the law of the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, which is the perfection of both the former. It is this way and reciprocally, there is no excuse, the Iew saith, he will follow the Mosaicall, and not be a Christian, the Turke saith he will doe neither, but obey the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. They are deceiued, for they differ only in this, that the first two serues to shew vs our sinnes, and make vs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excusable, the last saues vs from our sinnes and makes vs righteous before God, they be all but one law, procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding from lesse perfect, to more and most perfect, heere it is said <hi>Crede &amp; viues,</hi> there it was said <hi>fac &amp; viues.</hi> The seed sowen in the ground, it groweth first into the blade, next it shootes vp into the stalke, and thirdly it comes vp into the graine of corne: the seede of God, which is his word, it was sowen in the heart of <hi>Adam,</hi> where it grew to the blade, and then being in danger to wither, the Lord did refresh it by the <hi>Mosaicall</hi> law, where it brought out the stalke, and againe into the Gospell it produced the perfect corne and fruit of life: so that he who is not a good Christian, he is neither a perfect Iew, nor a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Philosopher: and by the contrarie, he who is a right Iew he must become a right Christian, they are necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily complicat. The Iew was bound to fulfill the Law, but he could not, &amp; we performe it in and by Christ, so that he can neuer performe a Iewish obligation, vnlesse he be a follower of Christ, <hi>omnia possum in Christo,</hi> saith the Apostle. This is no paradox, if God be (as he is which none doe denie) <hi>creatour of all men,</hi> master and monarke of all the World, the World then must be one familie, one City, one kingdome of God, no earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prince will willingly haue diuers Lawes in one king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, then shall we thinke that God, who is wiser then
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:4124:26"/>
men, and wisedome it selfe would giue seuerall lawes for the word? no, sure enough all those three be but one Law, the light whereof doth shine into the conscience of the Iew and Gentile, Turke and Pagan, Philosopher, and of the stupide multitude, <hi>signatum est super omnes lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men vultus Domini:</hi> whereupon it must follow, that this light is inextinguishable, it is that which we call our ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer dying conscience: when a man doth apprehend the knowledge of any thing by the vertue of his intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all minde it is science, and he is said <hi>Scire,</hi> to haue know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the conscience againe is the right application and imployment of this knowledge, it is a <hi>medium</hi> a midst be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, and the rule whereby we know if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing be in the counsels of our mind, or actions of our will, contrary to this naturall light, and diuine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct of reason, which God hath placed in our hearts like a cleere lampe to illuminate our intellectuall spirit, that it might see and discerne right from wrong, and truth from falsehood, which is a thing so manifest that the Ethnicke Philosophers, and the word of God doe iump vpon it: The naturallitie of <hi>Cicero,</hi> and the Theologie of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> concurre to proue it almost in the same termes: <hi>Cicero</hi> in the third Tusculan Question writing to <hi>Brutus, sunt enim ingenijs nostris semina innata virtutum, quae si adolescere liceret, neque illa celeriter malis moribus opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionibus<expan>

as is said are inspirations from heauen) contradictory to your opinions, that in that case you will suffer your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science to be directed by this light, which God hath giue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you to guide it by, &amp; that your Lo: wil forbeare your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of deuote ignorance &amp; <hi>implicita fides,</hi> things that do meerely extinguish this light of nature, if it please you to do so, &amp; not to smother vnder a bushel this cleere candle, which God hath illuminate in your heart, there is no doubt but as <hi>Cicero</hi> saith, that same <hi>Natura Dux,</hi> the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry light of Nature which hath a Diuine stampe in your conscience, shall shew you an outgate from the childish Labyrinths of superstition that doe inuolue your Lo: for if any should say to me, seeing there is such power in the instinct of naturall reason, flowing from this diuine light, how is it that so many millions of those who be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued with the same are induced to idolatrie, I can giue no other answere then the wise man hath giuen <hi>stultorum infinitus numerus est:</hi> the number of fooles and those who are mistaken in their owne light, is infinite.</p>
            <p>Now I will take my first aduantage of this ground to appeale to the diuine light of your Lo: conscience, how you do iudge of that which already from so many Texts of Scripture, I haue spoken touching the plainenesse and perfection of Gods word, since on the one part the spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God doth testifie, that it is eternall, incorruptible, and inspired from Heauen, able to make the man of God perfect, and on the other part this intellectual light of nature seruing as eyes to receiue in our conscience, the brightnesse of this word, it is so powerfull, that very Gentiles haue cleerely knowne it: and seeing it is suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to conuict the conscience of Turkes, and Pagans of contempt and ignorance of this word, I aske your Lo: how shall it be with vs who beside the hauing of this light, haue beene brought vp in Christian Religion, haue beene taught Gods word, can reade it in seuerall languages, and vnderstand it, when we shall refuse to beleeue for our faith, this word preached in puritie when
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:4124:27"/>
we shall hold it insufficient for our Saluation, embracing in place thereof, what? an <hi>implicita fides</hi> an implicite faith, the colliers beliefe, and what is that? I beleeue with the Church, and how beleeues shee? she doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue with the collier: is not this ambulare in <hi>circuitu impij</hi> as the Scripture saith, to walke in the about-gates of the wicked; well let vs remember how it shall be worse in that day with <hi>Corazim</hi> and <hi>Bethsaida</hi> then with <hi>Sodom,</hi> because they had greater light and did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spice it; They say ignorance is the <hi>mother of Deuotion:</hi> And the Apostle saith: <hi>Qui ignorat ignorabitur,</hi> if igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance cannot excuse a Turke, because of that light of Gods face which is stamped in his heart, let any man tell me what it can auaile a Christian to bragge of his deuout ignorance, affected ignorance is neuer a whit better then knowledge without beliefe or well doing. Let vs heere the Prophet <hi>Isay,</hi> my people is carried captiue, because <note place="margin">Isai 5.</note> they had no knowledge, neither is now a daies any other reason of idolatrous captiuitie, then this pretended holy ignorance, so that for a Christian man to glorie in it, it is to become <hi>sicut equus &amp; mulus quibus non est intellectus.</hi> Therefore let your Lo: remember you are sealed with this <hi>Lumen vultus Dei,</hi> and that he hath blessed you with knowledge to vnderstand, that the holy Scriptures are a perfect and neuer perishing word.</p>
            <p>The second ground I would haue your Lo: to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>descend <note place="margin">Definition of Idolatrie.</note> vpon with me for preparation of your more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different iudgement, is a certaine definition of idolatrie which may content your Lo: and me both, to the end we may the better reason of idolatrous worship: For as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning abuse in religion, and impietie in manners, they be triuiall points that there can be no mysterie in a sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uey of the same.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Idolon</hi> is a Greeke word which literally signifieth, as much as a litle Forme, or Figure, formed or figured, but taken as it is spoken in Christian Shooles, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the best Doctors it is a representation of a
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:4124:27"/>
false God, and a false Deitie, or a Creature taken and honoured for God. As to say the Statue of <hi>Moloch,</hi> of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> the Sunne, or Moone, the Hebrew word <hi>Elil,</hi> as I read, haue very right this same signification of <hi>Idol,</hi> and is vsed in holy Scripture to signifie the Pagan gods, which were things false, and so nothing. <hi>Esay</hi> saith of <note place="margin">Isai. 41.</note> the gods of the Gentiles, Behold you are nothing and your workes are of no worth. Vnto the which, Saint Paul alluding, Wee know, said he, that an Idol is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world: because howsoeuer it bee made of mettall, timber, or stone, yet because the falshood which it representeth is nothing, it is said to be nothing. Now so ielous is God of his honour and worship; That hee hath not only forbidden materiall images to bow down to them, but there is also spirituall Idolatry forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: whereof there is two sorts; The first is of these, who directly, or indirectly, haue society and company with the Diuell, and trust in him, as Sorterers, Magiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Witches, Consulters. The second is of those, who mainetaine any erronious opinion, concerning the worship of God, or against the word of God, or who doe cherish and defend, any great and odious vice, by a displayed banner against God, as the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1 Sam 15.</note> speaking of the disobedience of <hi>Saul:</hi> Your rebellion saith he, is the sinne of Witchcraft, and your trangres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, Idolatry, the reason is because hee who doth obey God after his own fantacie, and not after Gods expresse Commandement, he doth prefer his own conceipt, and make an Idol thereof, as Saint <hi>Ierome</hi> in this same sense shewes, how there was oftentimes Idolatry among the Iewes when they had no materiall Idoles, as the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, saith he, worship corporall Idoles; so the Iewes hold for gods, those Idoles which they haue forged in their soules, and therefore they are Pagans and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Saint <hi>Austen</hi> expounding the meaning of <hi>Iosua</hi> when he exhorted the Iewes newly entred in <hi>Palestina</hi> to put away their strange gods. It is not to be thought that
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:4124:28"/>
in this time the Iewes had any Pagan god, said hee, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause immediatly before he did praise their obedience, neither is it to bee thought that hee spake these wordes without cause; so it was, said he, that the holy Prophet vnderstanding them to haue in their hearts erroneous opinions of God, contrarie to his honour, hee desired them to leaue them. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> doth cleerely testifie, that the auaricious man, and the glutton, be Idolaters: the one of his gold, the other of his belly, <hi>Quorum De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>

The Iewes and Turkes this day doe not worship any materiall Idol, yea they worship the same God whom we doe, yet they are Idolaters, because they doe not acknowledge him as he is a <hi>Diuine Essence,</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished in three persons, but after a fantasie, deuised by <hi>Mahomet</hi> here, and there be the <hi>Cabbalists,</hi> of whom and of of all such, Saint <hi>Basil</hi> saith, Cursed be the men who forge false imaginatione in their owne braines, and <note place="margin">Isa. 2.</note> carry spirituall Idolatrie in their hearts. And <hi>Gregorie Nazianzene</hi> more plainely; How is it come, saith hee, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to this, that euery wicked man doth make a God of his wickednesse, his filthy passions, his wrath, his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, his lust, and drunkennesse, and other abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble excesse.

It being so then that the poore blinded Pagans, who are strangers to doctrine of holy Scripture, and kept backe from it by the lawes of Tyrants, they are thus conuicted by the Doctors of the Church, not onely for materiall Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie, but euen for spirituall, through the excesse of euery predominant vice, or erroneous phantasie which did transport them, and that Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> introduces <hi>Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sua</hi> as we haue heard, exhorting the Iewes to quit their Idolatry of wrongfull opinions, I wil in like manner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to the diuine light of your Lo: conscience, how vigilant you thinke a good Christian must be about the points of Gods worship, or what warrant there is (this description of Idolatry admitted) first, to erect and maintain such number of images in the Popish Church. Secondly, what warrant to equall with God the power of the blessed Virgin. And lastly, and aboue all, what warrant presumptuously to affirme, that any elementa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie thing is really the person of God himselfe. I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand that from such grounds as bee in the Romane Church, your Lo: will giue pretended reason enough, but that is contrary to my protestation, whereby I haue tyed your Lo. to that which the Diuine instinct of your conscience doth say to you, in fauours of the meanest of those superstitions; as for the last two of them, I need not insist much, because I thinke they bee <hi>extra contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersiam</hi> Idolatries; But vnderstanding well, how your Lordshippe will holde for the Images, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the good meaning and vse which is had of them, and from the common ground, <hi>ab abusu ad non vsum non est argumentum;</hi> Certainely, such fearefull abuses haue I seene, which make me to say, <hi>alas,</hi> wee doe not remember what a peremptorie, terrible and Iealous God hee is, in the whole order, and in the

smallest circumstances of his worship, he hath said hee is a <hi>Spirit,</hi> and will be worshipped in spirit, and no other will content him; Let vs exhauste our whole meanes, let vs distill our braines from neuer so good a meaning, to worship him, if our doing goe not with his owne rule, it is hatefull abomination in his eyes, and chiefly where any thing is added, or altered to the substance and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of Gods word, giuen out by himselfe, it is Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, (and which is more) in the highest degree, whereof that one instance of King <hi>Saul</hi> his disobedience might suffice for a thousand examples, who could haue doubted of his extraordinary good meaning, in sparing the fat beastes to sacrifice vnto the Lord: more, who would not haue imagined it should approue his thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse towards God, and yet the Prophet <hi>Samuel</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led it the sinne of Witchcrafte, which is Idolatry in the Superlatiue degree, and for it, had denounced the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and transferring of his kingdome: why? because the Lord who knowes the heart of man, he did see that <hi>Saul</hi> by his addition to his Commandement did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre his owne inuention thereunto, hunting thereby af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a reputation of zeale in Gods seruice, and so honour to himselfe; God lookes to the sinceritie of our spirit, to see that no arrogancie be there, nor no discrepance from his holy will in matters of his worship, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times did he cast off his people Israel, because of their presumptuous confidence in religious Ceremonies, in false and Pharisaicall workes, because of their lippe-la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and externall shew of pietie, saying, their heart was farre from him, and that he was caried with their tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and lothsome sacrifices. <hi>Sisteterint Moses &amp; Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el coram me non est anima mea ad populum istum.</hi> Euen the best earthly Princes are jealous of their Maiestie, but this God of Maiestie he is a consuming fire of jelousie in points of his worship, he pronounced <hi>Sauls</hi> reprobation and ouerthrowe by <hi>Samuel,</hi> for that which appeared to man a light transgression, because it was a point of his

Maiestie and honour, but by the Prophet <hi>Nathan</hi> hee easily pardoned <hi>Dauid</hi> for his adulterie and murther, which seemed in humane eyes most hainous wickednes, because they were not points of his worship, but sinnes of weakenesse: next he looked to both their hearts, in the heart of <hi>Dauid,</hi> it was fleshly corruption which made him to fall, in the heart of <hi>Saul</hi> it was the pride of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Idolatry, adding to Gods worship, thinking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe wiser then God, and saying to the Prophet, he had obeyed God, as it is said in the Church of Rome, that worshipping of Images is a point of Gods honour, while as it is directly contrary to his Commandement. Let all the world tremble at that strict dealing of the Lord with his good seruant <hi>Moses,</hi> in a point of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement at the waters of Contradiction, were the Israelites did grudge: God said to <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> that they should take vp the Rodde, and speake to the Rocke of <hi>Rephidim</hi> and it should yeeld waters, <hi>loquimini ad Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <p>A relation of the lewde and impudent superstitions of Rome, and of the ridiculous miracles which be pretended thereinto.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>AS for the working of miracles, together and at once shall a man see the falsehood of that, and the truth of idolatrous worship, and both in such lewde open and impudent manner, that it seemes to me the first miracle in the World, how such trumperies should be so long belieued: For as true Religion hath the owne corruption by reason of our corruption, so euerie superstition hath the owne periods, as experience from time to time hath taught. So soone as I entered in Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bardy at Turine the seat of the Sauoiard, it was told me there, that the Duke had lately arriued from a Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of <hi>Loret,</hi> &amp; that the Prince his son, was at the Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gremage of <hi>nostra donna de mondenie.</hi>
            </p>

            <p>So I will conclude this point of Miracles and Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous worship with two short obseruations, first for that exteriour splendor and shew of Religion by so many pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages, holy dayes and festiuall euenings and others deuoute like exercises which doe blind simple people, I say it is the common marke and maske both of Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous seruice; the very pretended zeale and holy pretext of <hi>Balaam</hi> when he came to sacrifice vpon the mount of <hi>Balaac,</hi> did bewray his Treacherie, he cryed to build him seuen altars, while as <hi>Abraham</hi> who was so faithful &amp; sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere a sacrificer, that the Spirit of God doth honor him with this Testimonie, <hi>Abraham beleeued the Lord, and it

was imputed to him for Righteousnesse:</hi> the first father of all the faithfull when hee went vnto the mount to offer his sonne <hi>Isaac,</hi> hee did content himselfe with one Altar, knowing how it is one Altar only that doth please God, and what is that? &amp; what is the sacrifice? the Altar of our heart prouiding it bee in vprightesnesse and faith, the immolation of contrite and faithfull prayers, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Dauid</hi> saith (contrary to <hi>Balaam,</hi> who would haue no lesse then seuen Altars) <hi>Quoniam si voluisses sacrifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um dedissem, vti<expan>

Secondly I say, of such opinion maintained of miracles and popular credulitie, as it was in Gentilisme said by <hi>Numa Pompil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, Patres consilio valere decet, populo superuacanea est cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liditas:</hi> The fathers of states should be wise, and subtile, but the people simple: so it is now said in Christian su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions, that <hi>ignorance is the mother of Deuotion,</hi> &amp; that Apocrypha speech of <hi>Esdra, Haec narrabis Populo, &amp; haec abscondes,</hi> holden for good Scripture, it is the speciall Stratagem whereby the diuell doth leade men into the snares of idolatry to crie for miracles, and to depend vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: They haue bene only ordained by God to beat and breake downe the hardnesse of infidelitie in the first plantation of the faith, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> were strong in miracles, but the Israelites did no sooner come to the borders of Canaan, then they lost the light of their fierie pillar which conueyed them to it; they had no sooner passed Iordan, then the Manna ceased to raine downe foode vpon them.

miracles: So as we must say that as he had beene a sencelesse Iewe, who would haue refused to goe forward into Canaan, because hee wanted the pillar to conuey him, and the Manna to feede him, euen so must wee esteeme him a foolish Christian, who being entered into the cleere light of Christs Gospel, because he sees not the power of miracles which in the beginning of that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian Progresse was granted to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> for conducting of the first beleeuers through the wildernes of Gentilisme, or of Pharisaicall pride, and for comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to reiect stoutly the yoake of their spirituall <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> because of this he will refuse to be guided by the Arke of Gods word, wherein are comprehended the whole mysteries of his law; and without the which there is no way to the heauenly Canaan, certaine he must bee counted more then mad.</p>

thinke the <hi>Camera de Componendis,</hi> within Saint <hi>Peter</hi> Palace one of the richest houses in Christendome. This mooued a fine iest in a certaine German, who hauing some dispensation to purchase at Rome, which he look't to haue granted to him <hi>gratis,</hi> but finding an ordinance on the backe of it for paiment of one hundred Ducats, tooke a penne and blotted out the date wherein was said <hi>Datum Romae,</hi> putting in the place of it <hi>Empru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Romae</hi> swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, that because they had liberty of Conscience in Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manie, that he would rather take it vpon his libertie, then buy it so dearely. I did see their diuers Monasteries or Conuentuall houses of religious persons, wherein liue great numbers, which houses bee no way endued with rents nor prouided, but only referred to voluntary cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie: for helpe whereof, the Pope doth grant them some priuiledged Altars, with extraordinary Indulgences, and a peculiar Festiuall day, vpon the which, thither the whole people resorteth, but chiefely profligat and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baushed persons: as, Whoores, Bawdes, idle Rascalls, Charlatanes Coosoners, who for the offer of some grosse almes, bring back with them so many Pardons of sinnes, so many soule Masses by redemption from Purgatory: induring which time of the Visitation of this Altar, the people entring at one dore, and issuing out at an other, all the day long, without intermission, there is no other voyce to be heard at the first port, but calling out aloud, <hi>Fate vna bellissima diuotione:</hi> Make, Sirs, a braue deuotion; by the which is meant, to giue a fat Offering Conferring this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:4124:39"/>
I did receiue no other answere, but what was once graunted by the Pope was absolutely good and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all for all. Againe, I saw this, which fell foorth during my being there: The Duke of <hi>Neuers</hi> came there in great and glorious state, extraordinar Ambassador from the <hi>French</hi> King to the Pope, who, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome of that Seat, with such personages, did grauut him Indulgences very large and bountifull, that one would haue thought the ports of hell was not able to preuaile against them: and when the Dukes Medalls and Beads came to be blessed vpon the Popes Altar, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the forme, there was no famous Whore in <hi>Rome</hi> who had not also numbers put in for her, saying, (which I haue heard with mine eares) The <hi>French</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgences should procure them both <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Spanish</hi> money. This kinde of Marchandise and publike sale of sinnes is vsed in so lewd and vile a manner, that the most simple man in the world would count it to bee a scuruie ridiculous inuention of insatiable auarice. During my being at <hi>Rome,</hi> there hapned to dye there a rich <hi>Venetian</hi> Merchant, who left in Legacy a good summe of money to that Church, standing vpon the <hi>Monte di Trinita,</hi> for celebration of his Funeralls, and seruices for his soule, the same day which was appointed for those Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Offices, I did finde my selfe soone in the morning vpon that Mount, because it is a fresh and delectable walke, when a number of <hi>Fryers,</hi> with great Torches, comming to enter into the Church, was demanded of a Gentleman of <hi>Rome,</hi> who was beside me, whither they did goe? to whom one of them did answere, <hi>Andiamo cauare del purgatorio Lá<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

This sort of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is so frequent there, that we see no other businesse: and if it be true which they hold, <hi>Quel che fa sua santita è fatto,</hi> that which the Popes Holinesse doth, is done, certaine all those of those Countries must bee in heauen before their feete be cold, as wee say, because the most wicked and godlesse among them neuer departeh this life, but laden with Pardons. And this farre I thinke is enough to prooue, that the abuse is not onely authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, but as it were married with Religion, seeing vpon the meanes thereof they doe found Cloystrall societies. And this onely speaking <hi>de facto,</hi> for to reason <hi>Quo iure,</hi> these are practised, it is Theologicall, alwaies the most learned among them haue said to me touching the Popes pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Ilnostro signore è dio sopta la terra,</hi> Our Lord the Pope he is God vpon earth, hee may dispence what hee will: Yea (say they) if the question were to marry the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> to an hereticall Princesse, the Pope will first dispense him to marry his owne Sister. Is not this to go aboue the power of God, who hath said of his holy Law, that a jot thereof shall not perish not be changed? Well, to vrge Theologicall Arguments I will not, but I remit your Lordship to search-the Scriptures, to see who it is there that doth sit in the Church of God, and exalt <note place="margin">Dan. 11. 2.

And now I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale to the diuine light of your Lordships conscience, whether you doe not thinke that the contemplation of so grosse things; first, such Ethnicke Idolatry, that while <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> being aliue, did teare their cloathes, and runne vpon the people, because they would haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dored

them, saying, they were but men like vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues.

Then such impious and base auarice in this trade of Purgatory and Indulgences, that in their <hi>Came<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra de Componendis</hi> there sitteth <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> vnder the name of <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> making sale of the Spirit of God for money, of the mercies of God, of remission of sinnes, and the Kingdome of heauen, and that with such insati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hands, that if euer I, who came from a remote Countrey to honour the Apostolicall Seat, would giue him largely for dispensation, hee would willingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it, as who knowes what I did pretend: to bee the more assured, I appeale to your Lordships conscience, whether you thinke those were not sufficient to breede doubts of Religion in any man, in whom God hath left a sparke of his feare, or one graine of right knowledge. Assuredly they mooued me to great iealousie, and they were to me (as the first sight of the Angell was to the poore Asse of <hi>Balaam)</hi> terror albeit (I confesse sincerely) the strong opinion which I had drunken so long before, &amp; the plausible shew of things, did for a while violently hold me into the same way, as <hi>Balaam</hi> did force his Asse to goe on, after the first sight of the Angell.</p>

and of darkenes, then it is likely that the kingdom of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan is at Rome, and not the kingdome of Christ: but that the kingdome of the world is called the kingdom of sin, the Scripture doth shew, The Spirit of God in the Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell, compriseth the world vnder the name of sin, &amp; hath diuided it in three. Whatsoeuer saith <hi>Iohn</hi> is in this world, <note place="margin">Iohn 1. 2.</note> it is either concupiscence of the eye, concupiscence of the flesh, or pride of life: we may behold the wonderfull harmony and correspondence of the same spirit of God throughout the whole Scriptures, in old and new Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as I said before, he hath made this diuision of the world and of sinne heere, equall with that diuersitie of sinne which did enter into the world with <hi>Eua,</hi> in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the booke of God, The text of <hi>Moses</hi> saith, and the woman saw that the Tree was pleasant to the eie, (there is concupiscence of the eye) that it was good for meate, (concupiscence of the flesh) and that it was to be desired for knowledge, (pride of life, emulation with God) so that the enioying of these three concupiscences, is the enioying of the kingdome of the world, <hi>as Iohn</hi> saith, and that againe to bee contrarie to the kingdome of Christ, no man can denie. For Christ had the offer made vnto him of the kingdomes of the world from Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, as we know, and did refuse it: <hi>Haec omnia tibi dabo si cadens adoraneris me.</hi> Now whither or not the Popes haue taken this dominion of Rome from Christ, who said to their predecessor S. <hi>Peter: Exemplum tibi dedi vt quemadmodum ego feci ita &amp; faciastu,</hi> or from the diuell, <note place="margin">Ezech. 16.</note> who is prince of the world, it must bee tried from those concupiscences; The Spirit of God bath said in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>Haec fuit iniquit as Sodomae abundautia &amp; otium,</hi> I will not rashly say, that Rome is Sodom, vnlesse I shew rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, but I will aske if euer any towne, state or people had more abundance, and idlenesse then haue the Pope, Cardinals, and Consistory of Rome, and all their togall Clergie, who doe more truely proclaime <hi>Cedant arma Togae,</hi> then euer did their predecessor <hi>Cicero.</hi> For he was

            </argument>
            <p>THe pernitious Doctrine of this Tyrannicall Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie vnknowen to antiquitie, lately conceiued in the bosome of the treacherous Iesuite, tending to a monstrous ambition as we shal see, to the ouerthrow of good Princes and people, and dissolution of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian discipline and obedience, it doth enuenome the mindes of men with diuelish errours, and armeth their hearts with odious and treasonable attempts. It is that wormewood whereof the Prophet of the Gospel, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> maketh mention in his visions of the Apocalips: <hi>Cecidit de coelo stella magna ardens tanquam fauilla &amp; nomen stellae dicitur absinthium, &amp; facta est tertia pars aquarum in absinthium, plarimi mortui sunt de acquis, quia amarae factae sunt,</hi> saith he, there fell from the heauen a great starre, burning like a flame, and the name of the starre was <hi>Wormewood:</hi> and multitudes died by the waters, because they were become bitter. It was no true starre which the Prophet did see, because the true starres bee fixed and doe not fall: <hi>Stell<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <note place="margin">Dan. 12.</note> They who instruct and teach many righteousnesse and godlinesse, be like vnto starres fixed to perpetuity. As for those which appeare to be falling starres, as this visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> they are but grosse vapours lightned by
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:4124:46"/>
agitation of the ayre, which do quickly vanish and keepe no true light. So the Iesuites lately bred in the distem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and tempestuous ayre of the Papall tyranny, they appeare to be, but are not true starres in Gods Church, they bee but filthie vapours which shall disappeare within short time, as the whole Clergie almost of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church it selfe doth hold, after the example and fortune of the famous order of the Knights <hi>Templarij,</hi> whose insolencie and pride was abhorred of Christian Princes and Prelates: But in the meane time they haue poysoned by the wormwood of this diabolicall doctrine the puritie of our waters, euen the waters of life, the word of the Gospel, the Lord Iesus Christ who calleth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe so, of which poyson, who would know how many millions haue died, let him read the Histories of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly League, and the Histories of France and the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands for these yeeres passed, and because it is so preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and perilous an error, I will insist in it at greater length to deduce it from the fountaines of sacred and primitiue veritie. For your Lordships information and many others of your profession, who if you will not quit this ground to beleeue as the Church of Rome doth command, you cannot want a scruple in your conscience for hauing so absolutely taken the oath of obedience, seeing the contrarie is strongly maintained in Rome in meeretermes of a point Doctrinall, which albeit your Lo: would not credit vpon my reletion after my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from thence, where I was both care &amp; eye witnes, and brought with me a true transcript of the ordinance it selfe, yet now all the world doth know it since the high Court of Parliament at Paris hath beene perturbed with the agitation thereof sithence. This I thinke is the best seruice which I can yeeld to God, my Soueraigne prince and to the common weale, seeing it doth concerne euery good subiect both Theologically and ciuilly to vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand what hee doth owe to his King in his conscience for Religion, and ciuilly it concernes him for the securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:4124:46"/>
of his state: The Iesuits indeed haue most subtilly gon about to make an <hi>Antithesis</hi> or contradiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Principautie and Priesthood, holding this to be onely diuine, and that onely humane; and therefore that to be subiect vnto this: vpon which <hi>Antithesis</hi> they build this vsurpation ouer Princes and states, but if your Lo: doe not stop your eares against the following dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, I hope your Lordship shall find that in my pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grination beyond seas, I did furnish my selfe with as much concerning the substance of this question from the most learned, both writers and speakers, as is sufficient to ridde any man whatsoeuer of this dangerous doubt, vnlesse it be those whose hearts and best spirits are already ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the poyson of this deadly <hi>Absinthium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And first I lay downe this generall Thesis, that all such authoritie and power in the Church, which doth disproue Christian &amp; orthodoxal Magistrates, erecting violent vsurpations, in their place is manifestly contrary to the voyce of Christ in the Euangell, the practise of the primitiue Church, approued by the great doctors thereof in all following ages: yea and contrary the first ordinance of God in the typicall gouernment of <hi>Moses,</hi> and consequently all such doctrine which doe maine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the same, must bee hereticall and impious: To cleare this generall Thesis in the fountaine, let vs looke vpon the first plantation of Christs Church, and the condition wherein it was setled, which by the Spirit of God is compared to a vineyard: <hi>Homo quidem paterfami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias plantauit vineam &amp; circundedit eam sepibus:</hi> and so forth; as we read in the Text, <hi>A certaine husbandman planted a vineyard,</hi> and hedged it about: This is the vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of Christianitie watered and made fertile by the foure floods of the foure Euangelists, as is mystically fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured in Genesis: A flood went out of Eden to water the garden, and from thence it was diuided into foure heads, Christ who is the planter of this vineyard, hath fortified it in the Gospel, with three seuerall walles, as so many
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:4124:47"/>
diches and rampards to compasse it: The first fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and wall is the word of God and holy Scripture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst heresies and heretickes; <hi>Vt potens sit exhortari in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinasana &amp; eos qui contradicu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t arguere,</hi> to be able to reach <note place="margin">Timoth. 1.</note> wholsome doctrin, &amp; to improue them who speak against it. The second Fortification is of spirituall Iurisdiction against those who be rebellious, <hi>Qui Ecclesiam non audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerit sit tibi tanquam Ethnicus &amp; Publicanus:</hi> who is to be excommunicate from the company of the Saints. The <note place="margin">Math. 18.</note> third Fortification is of Temporall power against hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane inuasions, <hi>Duo gladij.</hi> Vpon the first of which three Ramparts hee hath placed learned Doctors in the <note place="margin">Luk. 22.</note> Church, who are furnished with spirituall wisedome to conuict herefie. Vpon the second, Prelates, with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie to excommunicate those who be disobedient to the voyce of Christ. Vpon the third, <hi>Brachium seculare:</hi> Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill power of Princes to guard his Church from the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution and inuasion of rauening Wolues, from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and from intestine disorders, without any of which three this Vineyard of Christ is neuer sufficiently forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.

And since such is the impudent and arrogant malignitie of the Iesuiticall ambition in their doctrine about this point, what if (to meete them in their owne
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:4124:49"/>
language, and pay them home with their owne Coyne) I should goe yet one degree higher in that particular, to say that appearantlie God himselfe doth prefer the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall function, when by his Prophet, setting aside all sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices and ceremonies (which was the Priests part) hee did require the Office of the ciuill Magistrate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, <hi>Quid af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertis tanta sacrificia, discite vos reges &amp; Principes qui</hi>

            <p>The Deut<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. doth shew, that the office of a Prince was not to frame his owne life after the deuteronomicall, but to prouide that both Priests and people should keepe the same inuiolable. If Priests debord and transgresse Gods law, must not the Prince corect them? yea, if they shuld sow haeretical doctrins, who could stop the growth of them other then the Prince? Of which thinges, it is most manifest, that God hath laid the whole burthen of earthly gouernment vpon these two Iurisdictions of the Ciuill authoritie and Priesthood, as the two diuine Arches vpon the which the policie of the world is sustai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned: they are as the two Poles which fixe the Axletree of the coelestiall Spheres, directly looking one vpon the other: which two, if they should neuer so little incline to obliquitie, fall to iarre, or presse to draw the one the other, it were to disturbe and endanger the whole frame of the world, which is carryed vpon their conjunction: euen so the variance of the Temporall and Spirituall Magistrate is to cut the Axletree, whereupon, as on a mighty <hi>Atlas,</hi> the Sphere of Christian gouernment doth relye. And this farre I adde: In the beginning all the Patriarks had the Priesthood coupled with their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:4124:50"/>
office, euen from the day of <hi>Adam:</hi> And in after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, whensoeuer any constraint or corruption of time bred a necessitie to confound them in one person, it hath euer beene so, that the ciuill authoritie did carry the Priesthood: which coniunction we finde to haue beene twice in the person of one: first in <hi>Moses,</hi> who was so farre preferred to <hi>Aaron,</hi> or to his particular office, that God said, <hi>Aaron</hi> shall speake for thee those words which thou shalt put into his mouth, and thou shalt bee as his God. And thereafter againe, by reason of corruption in latter times, God did suffer the Princes of the Macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes and Almonei to possesse the Priesthood also, as, <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Ioannes, Alexander, Hircanus,</hi> and <hi>Aristobulus,</hi> of whom some are witnessed in the Booke of <hi>Machabes</hi> to haue beene rare and excellent men: as, <hi>Simon Onia,</hi> of whom it is said, <hi>Erat tanquam astrum matutinum inter nubes &amp; tanquam Solrefulgens intemplo altissimi:</hi> He was like the day Starre among the cloudes, and as a shining Sunne in the Temple of the most High. Which confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion <note place="margin">Eccle. 52.</note> of seuerall powers, our Sauiour againe in his time did cleerely distinguish, commaunding to giue to God, that which was his; and to <hi>Caesar</hi> that which was due to him: after which Christian Princes &amp; Prelates did long liue, euery one contented to attend their owne function: Prelates to pray for Princes to teach their people, and watch ouer their soules; Princes againe to nourish them, to protect the Church, and minister Iustice, vntill the poles of this gouernment beganne to shake through va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie of the Priesthood, striuing so much to inuade the Temporall puissance, and to confound the two functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in their owne persone whereof I will relate what hath beene the iudgement and practise of the Fathers, of most simple and vnsuspected antiquitie of the primitiue Church: Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith of these two Iurisdictions, that the one doth assist the other mutually. Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> saith the same in his Epistleto <hi>Macedonius. Boniface,</hi> in his Letter to the Emperour <hi>Honorius</hi> saith, it were too
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:4124:50"/>
great burthen for the Church to ouerwatch spirituall things, if she were tyed to any temporall care. Saint <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> in his Epistle saith, to inuolue the Church in worldly affayres, were to estrange her from God. Saint <hi>Iohn Chrysost.</hi> as also <hi>Augustine,</hi> against the Manichees, do af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, there is no power but from God, eyther that hee doth establish it, or permit it, for the execution of his will in mercy, or in iustice: for the which reasons, say they, a Christian subiect may serue vnder the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of an Infidell or sacriledgious King: and as the iniquitie of the commandement doth render the Prince culpable, so doeth the band of obedience keepe the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect innocent. All Antiquitie doth conclude with Saint <hi>Augustine</hi> in the Citie of God thus: God onely doth ordinate Kings after his secret pleasure, good or bad, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our merits or demerits: therefore, saith hee, it is our part onely to obey, vnlesse we will repine against God; for, saith he, the great God, who gaue Empire to the Assyrians and Persians, hee granted it vnto the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes when he pleased, and as great as he pleased: hee raysed the power of <hi>Marius,</hi> hee yeelded authoritie to <hi>Caesar,</hi> to <hi>Augustus,</hi> yea, to <hi>Nero,</hi> to <hi>Vespasian,</hi> and to his gracious sonne <hi>Titus,</hi> and to his tyrannous brother <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitian.</hi> And finally, saith this holy Father, he who pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced into the Empire the most Christian <hi>Constantine,</hi> hee did also honour with the same power the filthy Apostat <hi>Iulian:</hi> and howsoeuer the causes of this proceeding in God be hidden, and mysticall, saith he, yet they are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly iust and holy.</p>
            <p>This is the doctrine of Antiquitie, whereupon the Primitiue Church did in euery thing of exterior gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment depend vpon the temporall Soueraintie, whether in ciuill or criminall cases, if any man did inuade Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall patrimony or goods, they did remit it to the imperiall Iudicatorie, if any man did offer violence, or kill a Bishop, they did the same, as <hi>Augustine</hi> testifies vpon the Epistle to the Romanes, these,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:4124:51"/>
and such like, bee the Precepts which are left to vs from Antiquitie for Christian policie or gouernment. The practise of the Primitiue Church hath bene agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this doctrine, for in their gouernement wee doe obserue three things, which haue beene inuiolably kept of them. First not onely did the Church serue and obey Pagans, Tyrants, and abominable monsters in the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, who refused her for their mother, who did afflict, and persecute her, but she did make ordinary prayers to God for their happinesse, so farre, that (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth) diuers Ethnickes did ascribe it as a peculiar glory to Primitiue Christians, that their exercise was to pray for their enemies, shewing how farre Christian profession doth surmount the doctrine of Philosophie.</p>
            <p>Secondly, where the Emperors begun to range them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues vnder the holy ensignes of the Church, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming her <hi>Alumni,</hi> and children, she did obey vnto the most cruell hereticks as to <hi>Constantius, Valens,</hi> and others, and to the greatest Apostates and mockers of Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, as vnto <hi>Iulian,</hi> notwithstanding of whose bloodie persecutions, she neuer left her obedience, as the Records of her ancient Counsels beare witnesse: wherein any man may reade the processe of the Councell of <hi>Arimini,</hi> that worthie Bishop <hi>Melitus,</hi> the light of Asia in his time, did write vnto the Emperour <hi>Antonius</hi> those words, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to a true version. Ye haue sent, saith he, such rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous edicts against vs, for tormenting of vs vnto death, thinking thereby to extinguish the name of Christians, we know not if these haue proceeded from your owne will, which if it be, in that case we shall obey you, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can come from you but good: but wee doe most humbly beseech you to consider, that their are many Calumniators about your person, that seeke how to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy vs, that they may possesse our goods.

If they haue, why did Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his time cry, <hi>Querimus vos non vestra?</hi> And why hath Saint <hi>Ambrose</hi> and <hi>Optatus Mileuitanus</hi> in his third booke <hi>Aduersus Parmenianum</hi> said, That Emperours and Kings be within the Church, but that the Empire is without it, yea say they the Church is within the Empire, &amp; in token that Antiquitie did exempt things temporall from the dint of excommunication, when Pope <hi>Marcelline</hi> did sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to Idols, and Pope <hi>Honorio</hi> became a Monothelet Hereticke, they were excommunicate, but did not loose their Bishopprickes, Pope <hi>Formose</hi> Bishop of Port was chosen successor to the same Pope, who had excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate him.

            <p>Thirdlie we doe obserue of the primitiue Church that whensoeuer she did enioy good and godly Emperours, they did not onelie not repute them as priuate members of the Church, iudicable by the power Ecclesiasticall, but contrarie they hold them chiefe members of their generall counsels vnder their misticall head <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> yeelding to them the authoritie of conuocation, and whole exteriour Iurisdiction, giuing them the tittle of common and externall Bishopes; For we reade in Euse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bius that Constantine the great was called so of the Church and said to bee brother vnto the fathers, in which qualitie of a common Bishop he did exercise his power ouer the Church exteriorlie, and ouer Bishops: In like maner we find that in the <hi>Calcedonian</hi> councel the Emperour was called vniuersall Bishops, yea Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie did esteme no counsell supreame, wherein an Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour did not sit and praesidiat.

The truth thereof is so cleerely verified in the whole practise of this Primitiue Church, that the Epistles Synodals of the first Counsell of Nice, those holy Bishops did write them in this stile. For as much, say they, as by the grace of God and by the commandement of the most sacred Emperour <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> the great, this holy Counsell hath beene assembled, without any mention at all of Pope <hi>Siluester</hi> his letters, the same tenor is obserued in the Synodall Epistle of the Counsell of Trullo, where the Fathers did prayse <hi>Iusti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> the second, because he had assembled them foorth of diuers nations, to the imitation of Christ, who sought so carefully the straying sheepe in the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine.</p>
            <p>This authoritie Temporall ouer the Church, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised euen by <hi>Constantine</hi> the great himselfe, who was the greatest zealator of the Church of any Emperour, and who called them Gods in the Church, so long as they did minister the Sacraments and holy things, yet when he commeth after that, to speake of the subiection and duetie of euery Bishop to him, in that letter which he wrote for the assemblie of the Counsell of Tyre, he saith
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:4124:55"/>
that they should conueine vnder the paine of exile, and that hee should teach all disobedient Bishops to know that they must liue vnder the authoritie of a sacred Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, declaring therby, that in the poynts of externall policy, he did esteeme them as men &amp; ordinary subiects, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in their spiritual functions he had counted as Gods. The same authoritie was practised by <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> who in his time did conuocate eight Councels, and by his sonne <hi>Lewis Debonnaire,</hi> who did assemble one. And to shew it more plainely, that this power to conuocate was Imperiall, and not Episcopall, we read how all the Popes of those dayes did write to Emperours for that effect: Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> sent to <hi>Honorius</hi> fiue Bishops &amp; two Priests to obtaine a Councell for the restitution of Saint <hi>Iohn Chrysostome,</hi> as we read in <hi>Euagrius.</hi> Pope <hi>Leo</hi> doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech <hi>Valentine</hi> the third, to obtaine of <hi>Theodose</hi> the yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger a Councell against <hi>Eutiches:</hi> and in token that the Popes did not so much as pretend this power to assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, wee finde in <hi>Sozemene,</hi> that Pope <hi>Iulius</hi> complaines onely that the Bishops of the Orient did not inuite him to the Councell of Antioch, saying, that a law of the Church prouided that no Decree should passe without the opinion asked of the Bishop of Rome. And in <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deret</hi> Pope <hi>Damasus</hi> makes the same complaint, and in the same termes against the councel of Arimini, in which such honour was done to the Emperour <hi>Constantius,</hi> and such reuerence to his authoritie, that the Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uened there, being detayned too long, and being pressed to put downe some Decrees, which were not orthodox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, they durst not for all that depart vntill they had the Emperours leaue and permission. Further now will wee obserue the very internall Iurisdiction of the Church, and that which is meerely spirituall, to wit, the sentence of Excommunication, and how it was exercised: we doe finde two things in that, one is, we shall not see that the primitiue Church did excommunicate any Emperour or King, albeit there were more occasion against them,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:4124:55"/>
nor is now contained in the great <hi>Bul of the holy Thursday,</hi> which is yeerely published at Rome against Christian Kings and States. <hi>Constantius</hi> and <hi>Valeus</hi> persecuting he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retikes. <hi>Trinitaries,</hi> who would haue forced the Fathers to confessions against the Catholike faith, were not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate. <hi>Theodose</hi> the second, and <hi>Valentinian</hi> the third, Eutichean heretikes, were not excomunicate. <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>silieius,</hi> enemie to the Councell of <hi>Calcedon, Iustinian,</hi> and of Kings, <hi>Chilpericke</hi> King of France, infected with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianisme: <hi>Theodoricke</hi> King of Gothes: <hi>Atalarichus, Theodotus, Vittiges,</hi> and many others, of whom none was excommunicate, no not <hi>Iulian</hi> the <hi>Apostata,</hi> nor <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi> the second, who fell in an heresie three seuerall times, nor <hi>Iustinian,</hi> who fell twise, no, when they had banished Popes themselues: for wee read in an Epistle of Pope <hi>Siluerius,</hi> that beng banished by <hi>Belizarius,</hi> at the command of <hi>Iustinian</hi> his Master, he assembled cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Bishops to excommunicate <hi>Belizarius,</hi> but did not so much as murmurre against <hi>Iustinian,</hi> by whose directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he was persecuted.

               <hi>Valens,</hi> who caused some of them to be drowned. Secondly, we obserue on this point of Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Bishops in the primitiue Church did excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate by the consent and permission Imperiall: for Princes, fearing that Church Rulers should abuse the spirituall sword, made an ordinance, repeated afterwards <note place="margin">Iustin.

Some Bishops haue questioned hardly with Emperours: as a Bishop did commaund <hi>Phillip</hi> the Emperour, that hee should not enter into the Church, but remaine without in the place of the <hi>Penitentiaries.</hi> Saint <hi>Ambrose,</hi> Bishop

of <hi>Milane,</hi> dealt right so with <hi>Theodosius</hi> the great: but they did not pronounce any Excommunication maior against them; for then they would not haue enioyned them penance, if they had beene without the bosome of the Church. As for <hi>Anastatius,</hi> albeit some Churches, as that, and the Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> did excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate him, yet he was euer in peace and vnion with num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Catholike Churches in the <hi>Orient,</hi> which did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that it was not <hi>magnum anathema,</hi> but rather a t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merarious Act, howsoeuer this be, such two or three ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions will not serue against one ordinarie rule: for then to meete these, we finde in like manner three extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinarie acts of Imperiall authoritie, which caused ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate or eiect the Popes. <hi>Xistus,</hi> the third of that name, suspected for adulterie, was excommunicate by commaundement of <hi>Valens</hi> the third. <hi>Theodoricke</hi> King of Gothes did eiect from the Church Pope <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>machus.</hi> And the people of <hi>Rome,</hi> vnder the Magistrates, did forbid Pope <hi>Pelagius</hi> the assembly of the Church: besides, Saint <hi>Iohn Chrysostome</hi> deposed and expelled from his Church by <hi>Arcadius.</hi> As for the excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of <hi>Arcadius,</hi> done by Pope <hi>Gelasius,</hi> it is doubted of in the Ecclesiasticall histories: but I doe not speake of such extrauagant acts, but of that which was ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily followed, whereby it is still verified, that the whole sway of Iurisdiction Ecclesiasticall was in the Emperors. The Conuocation was due to them: the processe went by their permission and consent, their persons were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from excommunication, as wee haue heard, which bee three maine points of soueraigne Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement.</p>

            <p>Finally if we come to speake of the confirmations of councels and canons, which is the last point of Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall Iurisdiction, we also finde that nothing was solid vntill the imperiall approbation was conioyned to the spirituall. The Rolles of the decrees of the counsell of <hi>Nice</hi> and <hi>Constantinople</hi> were presented to <hi>Constantine</hi> and <hi>Theodosius</hi> to be subscribed and authorised by them; against which foresaide policie of the primitiue Church so farre depending vpon the Emperour, I know not what we can pretend, vnlesse we will be like those ignorant <hi>Gnostickes</hi> of whom <hi>Irenaeus</hi> doth make mention in the

Certayne the lawe of God is immutable and eternall and doeth not suffer ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse, nor is subiect to the measure of our fantasies.

I haue alwaies sufficiently cleered to your Lordship the mindes and practises of the Fathers of the Primitiue Church in this poynt of Princes. Now that I may not seeme to caluminate the Iesuite, I will summarily shew how he hath peruerted this doctrine, and poysoned it with his <hi>Absynthium.</hi> Next, I will relate how his preua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rication and falshood is impugned by Catholike <hi>Romans</hi> themselues, the <hi>French</hi> Church, and that famous <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium</hi> of <hi>Sorbon.</hi> And lastly, I will discourse a little of the dessigne of this pernicious doctrine, which is a diuellish plot of feareful ambition, by length of time, to draw the whole world vnder the superstitious hyerarchy of <hi>Rome,</hi> both in temporality and spirituality, if it bee not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uented.</p>
            <p>There be three grounds of this doctrine tied together in one chaine, which in effect be but one thing teaching the Soueraigne power of the Pope ouer Princes, which power is extended by three Armes, power ouer their

            <p>Secondly, they know this to bee a true Maxime in gouernment, that no great power can longer floorish then it doth make it selfe vseful, necessary, and formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to neighbour States: and finding that those things whereby the Popes were steadable and necessary to peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Countries, such as their Dispensations, Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriall Indulgences, force of excommunication, Vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sall title of Benefices ecclesiastique, were become distast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full and hated of most men, because of their open abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses and impieties, and that wise Kings were begunne to prye into them, chiefely those of <hi>England,</hi> therefore the Iesuites, to repayre this breach, did inuent this perniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous doctrine of the Popes Supremacie ouer the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralitie of Princes, to the end that no King should finde himselfe secure but in the fauour and trust of <hi>Rome.</hi>

            <p>Thirdly, they see, that besides the aforesaide abuses, two things did specially parrell the Papall Seat, one was the Immundities and ignorance of the Cloyster, religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men being giuen to their pleasures, and not to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie and learning, which was the first occasion of the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therian</hi> seperation, as we know: another was, that light and reformation did come into the Church by pastorall vigilance expressed by all meanes of most powerfull preaching, disputing, and writing in that age, which hath followed since <hi>Luther:</hi> for helpe of the first of these two, the Iesuites doe professe such a puritie in their Celibate, as (to giue them their due) is admirable: <hi>Siue fuerit caste, siue fuerit caute:</hi> if it were not that the flames of raging ambition doe ordinarily extinguish these hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mide and beastiall passions in any man almost.

            <p>And because all this discourse is of experience, I will tell your <hi>Lordship</hi> how this was very quickely noted to me by a certaine entercourse which did happen to me Being at <hi>Millaine</hi> in <hi>Lombardie,</hi> I did behold vpon the Gates of that Citie the Armes of <hi>Charlequint,</hi> gloriously planted, with many stately inscriptions, among the which this was to be read, <hi>Ad plantandam fidem &amp; ad colligenda Regna dispersa à Deo destinatus:</hi> Destinate by God for the plantation of the faith, and for the vnion of dispersed Kingdomes of the world: when I did obiect to one of my acquaintance of good vnderstanding, that <hi>Destinatus ad plantandam fidem</hi> was rather a title Apostolicall then Imperiall: Hee replyed to me, that it was Apostolicall: for (said hee) that Trinitie of the Godhead which is in heauen, of Father, Sonne, and holy Ghost, hath depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted here below another Trinitie for earthly gouernment, vnder whose obedience all power must bee ranged: the <hi>Pope</hi> the Father, the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> the Sonne, and the Societie of the <hi>Iesuites</hi> the holy Ghost: so that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription is thus to bee construed, said hee: The Iesuite,

who takes vpon him to bee the onely Plantator of the faith, being (as the holy Ghost of this Trinity) sent forth among stranger Princes to seduce their people to rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, by sowing into their hearts the seedes of superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and sedition, which so soone as that Prince or King doth offer to punish, the Pope, who hath the place of the Father, he doth excommunicate him: and lastly, giue commission to the King of <hi>Spaine</hi> to inuade his Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, who hath the place of his onely Sonne and heyre, who only of all Princes doth vnderstand the right <hi>Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and is onely destined to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute that which is appoynted in the Councell of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: so that hee also is Apostolicall, saide this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who was a <hi>Frenchman,</hi> and a true enemie to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard,</hi> as may be seene by this ingenious and pretty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit.

O but the word of God is eternall, and the doctrine of the Prophets is perpetuall, and Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolicall as that Church was Symbolicall, that to the worlds end, and in all ages the like sinnes shall procure the like vengeance: who be they who carrie hornes of ambition like vnto the Ramme? was there euer any pride comparable vnto that of Rome, where vnder co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of spirituall care, there is nothing but contriuing of monarchicall Tyrannie, by most wicked meanes, as if Christ had left that commission to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> which <hi>Anchises</hi> left vnto <hi>Aeneas</hi> the Grandfather of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manes.

            </argument>
            <p>IT were now a great happinesse for your Lo: if you could weigh with sound Iudgement, and out of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine light, which is in your soule the points of this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, in so many impious and superstitious trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, but your Lo: doth shut your eyes, and eares; I will yet tell you one iest of my experience. Being at Rome, I did often heare the chiefest Cardinals deplore, <hi>Tanquam mortem dilectissimae filiae,</hi> as the death of their most tender daughter, the falling away of this kingdome of Great Brittaine from the seate of Rome, affirming that in former ages we were the most vpright Catholike Romanes, and most zealous of Christendome, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing most curious to demaund a certaine vnderstanding man, the reason of that speech, he gaue me this answere, <hi>Per che crano simplichotti, lontani, mai intendeuano la cuillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neria di questa sedia:</hi> Because said he, your predecessors were simple people, farre distant from this, who neuer did truely vnderstand the trumperie of this seat; because I speake in <hi>foro conscientiae,</hi> your Lordship ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue me. Euen so, I say of your Lordship, you are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote from these places, and doe not see the truth of things, and when they are brought before you, you doe not looke vpon them with your right eye, but with your sinistrous eye, not with whole eyes, but with sore eyes; For like as those whose eyes are weake or diseased, doe see better in shadie and darke places, then in presence of the sunne, so they who haue the eyes of their soule
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:4124:70"/>
blinded with the shadowes of Pharisaicall coremonies of superstition, they cannot willingly abide to haue their sight tried before the brightnesse of Gods word: As there were among the Babylonians to be found numbers of holy vessels that were brought foorth of the Temple of Ierusalem, when the people were captiued, so in the Church of Rome there bee indeed; many good and Christian customes and ordinances, and sundry pure and sincere grounds of Doctrine mixed with these ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities and idolatrie, that wee may call it like vnto that monstrous Minotaure kept in the Labyrinth of <hi>Daedalus, Alter a parte hominem, alter a parte bouem,</hi> when the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of this monster went in to see it, her naturall affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on did neuer suffer her to behold the beastly part of it. It is iust so with many men, when they are brought where they may haue a perfect discouerie of this forged and monstrous worship, their naturall inclination to super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition will neuer permit them to behold the wicked and impious parts of it: and therefore, as multitudes who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred within that Labyrinth, were deuoured of that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, because they knew not the way to returne, till <hi>The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seus</hi> did deuise a meanes of retreat, by tying a thread to the entire by the one end, and carrying the other with him, he did come backe by the same. Euen so who doth eter within the mysticall Labyrinth of these cunning and craftie superstitions, deuised by many Dedalean artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, he is neuer able to make recourse, nor to saue him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vndeuoured of that monster, without he be tyed to the thread of Gods word. And he who is so, shall not onely passe most securely through the most secret pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces thereof, but (as <hi>Dauid</hi> got out of the hands of <hi>Goliah</hi> that speare wherwith he slew him) so shall he bring as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny arguments from that which he shall see among them, as shall suffice to confound themselues, wee slide into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors peece, and peece, and peece and peece we must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coile from them, we are not to looke for suddaine and miraculous conuersions, for that blow comming from
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:4124:71"/>
heauen which strooke S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the ground, suddainely draue the diuell out of him; for that diuine light which in an instant remoued the darkenesse of his soule, and made him crie, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou, I am heere.</hi> The dayes of miracles are past, we haue <hi>Moses,</hi> the Prophets and Apostles: we must follow the rule of Christ, <hi>Scruta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini Scripturas;</hi> search the Scriprures, because they giue testimonie of me. The way of conuersion to Gods truth is by diligent Reading of his word, by diligent hearing of the preachers of the same, by diligent prayer, who doth hold the bookes of holie Scripture insufficient hee reades in vaine, who prayeth with the Church of Rome, which thinkes she cannot erre, she hath no need of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, such Pharisaicall prayers are also in vaine.</p>
            <p>And therefore I meane now to giue your Lordship a Christian aduise, first by telling your Lordship, by what naturall defects many men lie ouer in this blindnesse, Secondly by shewing vnto your Lo: that which happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned vnto my selfe, and by what meanes and degrees I was freed from those errors wherein you are. And third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by pointing vnto your Lordship out of these, a way which I would wish you to follow in particular for your helpe: for the first, I say that the diuell seekes craftily to ouerthrow vs with our owne weapons also, hee worketh vpon the infirmities of our nature, he maketh aduantage of our naturall weakenesse; he assalteth the walles of our minds there, where the breach is likeliest, as he wil sooner tempt a man of a fierce and tygrish disposition to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit murther, then him who is naturally milde, modest, and meeke: so I hold this ignorance of men giuen ouer to Idolatrie, to proceede from one of those two faults in themselues; either it is a naturall inclination to supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that while they will not beleeue the holy Scriptures to be sufficient, they will giue faith enough to the most ridiculous <hi>Aniles fabulae,</hi> of the legendaries, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Straw miracle pretended to bee done heere, or there: in which kinde of foolishnesse I must say,
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:4124:71"/>
some of our Catholicke Romanes within this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome bee the poorest men vnder the heauen. Well, <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did see in the myracles of <hi>Moses</hi> the finger of God working, <hi>Ego te constituam Deum Pharaonis:</hi> but he gaue more credit to the Magicall miracles of his Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers: and why? because his heart was hardned. Let vs beware of this fearefull Iudgement therefore, which I haue told your <hi>Lordship,</hi> doth follow vpon Idolatrie, to be abandoned of the Lord, <hi>vt credant mendacio qui non crediderunt veritati:</hi> that they may beleeue lyes and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, who would not beleeue the truth: <hi>Indura cor populi huius, occoeca occulos, claude aures, &amp;c.</hi> Obdurate the heart of this people, close their cares, blinde their eyes, that they doe not heare, see, nor vnderstand, lest they turne to me, and I heale them, saith God to the Prophet. Or, next this obstinate and wilfull ignorance, wherein men cannot be broken, no, not from one point of most grosse things, it proceedes (as we haue obserued in many, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to iudge so of your <hi>Lordship)</hi> from a secret selfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loue, glorying to be called constant and inflexible. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly constancie and good resolution, it is a Cardinall ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and perseuerance in faith is the height of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian vertues: but beleeue me, this sort of constancie is a despightfull pride, it is to haue that which all the he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refiarches haue had <hi>hereticum ingenium,</hi> an hereticall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexible, and rebellious ingenie of Nature: such were <hi>Manicheus, Marcion, Arrius, Pelagius, &amp;c.</hi> Such an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike was not the good Father <hi>Augustine,</hi> who fell but <hi>Timide</hi> and <hi>Languide</hi> into the Manichean opinion, and was easily againe reformed by his good and toward na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by the inspiration of Gods Spirit, willingly to heare the Sermons, disputes, and conferences of the holy Saint <hi>Ambrose.</hi> Secondly, I will tell your <hi>Lordship</hi> syncerely by what steps it pleased God to grant me retreait foorth of this fearefull Labyrinth of Idolatrie: your <hi>Lordship</hi> hath heard how I already did distast these things, which I did see in <hi>Italy;</hi> but that did not serue the turne, it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deede
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:4124:72"/>
a good beginning: vpon my backe comming to <hi>France,</hi> and new conference with that famous Protestant <hi>Mounsieur Causabon</hi> resident then at <hi>Paris</hi> in the seruice of the late King, with whom I was familiar before, who now finding me somewhat better disposed, hee did farre second those beginnings of mine, saying to mee, that howseeuer it was the tricke of the Consistorie of <hi>Rome</hi> to deny any cause of reformation on their side, and to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime generall Councells: yet, if it pleased God to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spire the hearts of Princes to challenge that auhoritie o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer Ecclesiasticall gouernment, which was due to their Predecessors in the primitiue Church, that the body of the Catholike Church might be easily reformed, he told me that designe of <hi>Charl.</hi> 5. as I haue relared it vnto your <hi>Lordship,</hi> he told me, that two Emperours, his successors, <hi>Ferdinand</hi> &amp; <hi>Maximilian</hi> did much labour for the same. In token whereof, there be yet extant numbers of their letters sollicitatory, to that most graue and profound Doctor of the Romane Church: <hi>George Cassander,</hi> most zealously entreating him, touching his opinion of the deciding of Christian Controuersies, which Booke, with diuers other learned Treatises of other pacificators, he gaue me to read, as also these Theames written, <hi>De au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feribilitate Papae ab Ecclesia,</hi> as I haue shewen your <hi>Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> already. He told mee, that the seat of <hi>Rome</hi> was like vnto one, who hauing made vnlawfull purchase of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny neighbour Lands, doe so curiously maintaine their march stones, that they will not haue them to be remoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued halfe a foote, <hi>quia vno dato incommodo multa sequun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur,</hi> because, that one graunted, with the like equitie, much more were to bee demaunded. They doe well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member (saith he) that Embleme of <hi>Sylurus</hi> the <hi>Scythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> vnto his eyghtie sonnes, for the knot of their vnitie. A sheafe of Arrowes hardly bound, out of the which if one could bee taken out, it would quickly make the rest to scatter. The reformation of any one poynt might possibly (they feare) dissolue the whole Masse of that
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:4124:72"/>
superstitibus trade. These speeches did in like sort fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther my better iudgement. Next againe, vpon my arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall at the Court of England, vnto the which I brought the Commission of some aduertisements of this kinde from the same <hi>Mounsieur Causabon,</hi> and others, to the Kings Maiestie, where, my hearing his Maiesties lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned discourses sometimes at his Maiesties Table, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesse did also much shorten my way, seeing all the world doe talke of his rare and singular wit, and of the sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied knowledge which God hath giuen him in the holy Scriptures: I hope I may, without suspition of flatterie, say of his Maiestie, that which one of the first Order of wise men in the Land spake to my selfe while hee liued, the late Earle of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> that his Maiesties knowledge was supernaturall: that he was the highest Spheare, and neerest to God, which did receiue the first influence of wisedome: that hee was like to <hi>Salomon,</hi> of whom it was said, <hi>Beatiserui tui qui coram testant, &amp; audiu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t sapientiam tuam:</hi> Happy are thy seruants who stand before thee, and heare thy wisedome. That his Maiestie did bestow vpon his seruants riches and knowledge, and that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe did professe to haue gotten more encrease of good knowledge, then of Estate, since his Maiesties exaltation to the Crowne. Thereafter comming to Scotland, vpon the occasion of your <hi>Lordships</hi> transportation from the Castle of <hi>Edingburgh,</hi> vnto Saint <hi>Iohns towne,</hi> where you was confined, I did oftentimes heare, as your <hi>Lordship</hi> did, that great and diuine Preacher, now the Bishop of <hi>Galoway,</hi> who, for your instruction, did expressely choose his Thesis against those fallacious and false grounds of the antiquitie, vniuersalitie, and succession of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Church, which bee the points that most entangle your <hi>Lordships</hi> witte, and which hee did so learnedly cleere, that for my part, I doe acknowledge, they hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped greatly to disintangle my selfe. After this I went to dwell in <hi>Dundie</hi> for the space of two whole yeeres, where I did most diligently heare that excellent Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher

Master <hi>Dauid Lyndesay</hi> and his fellow labourers in the Church of that citie, in whose worth I thinke doth consiste no small parte of the happinesse thereof, I had my priuat conference with him to my great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort as he can beare me record. I had my solitarie exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sices in diuers subiects of Theologie, whereof I prayse the Lord I haue extant as manie testimonies as will suffice to shew my painfulnes to study the trueth of his worship, till now in the ende it hath pleased him of his mercie to giue me by faith a sure holde of the thread of his word, which is our onely guyde through this misticall pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of humane follies: of which threade our great <hi>Theseus</hi> Lord Iesus Christ hath left thee on ende heere with vs vpon earth in his word and hath tyed the other vpon the gate of heauen which he did first open, called for that by the spirit of God, the first borne among the dead, So that there is no meanes to ariue safelie vnto that porte but to keepe our eyes fixt vpon the course of this thread as our vndoubted Loadstarre, Thus I doe ingenuously confesse my owne weakenesse, to the glorie of God, yea if it should be to my shame. my vncertayne wandering in the wildernesse of my owne ignorance, brought vp in my infancie in the simple profession of Gods word at home, and then contemning it, to goe a whooring after strange Gods beyonde seas, like in that wise to the swyne in the Gospell before whome the pretious pearle should not haue beene caste. And returning homeward to much a Cassandrist halting betwixt two, that at my being at courte, the kings Maiest, in perceauing me thus to wander in matters of religion, tolde me, that I should take heede least I did imitate a certayne English gentleman, who in his youth was a protestant, in his trauayling beyonde seas a papist, and in his returning a Cassandrist, and now finally a most obdured Papist, which word did wound my heart and spurre me to craue of God a happie Resolution, which of his grace he hath so farre granted me, as I haue

<pb n="125" facs="tcp:4124:75"/>
Christian is called Catholike, as by that marke distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished from the Iewish Congregation: yet, I say, the Policie doth in effect remaine alike in both, the dealing of God with both is so like, and the sinnes of men in all ages be so like: the corruption of Religion by the length of time so like: and Gods Iudgements, threatned by his Prophets, doe fall out so like vpon all, then and now, that makes the comparison pertinent, cleere, and true: for concerning the chiefe poynt, which <hi>Rome</hi> vsurpeth, as Soueraigne to her, to be the perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Sanctuarie, it is altogether idle, to reason that <hi>Rome,</hi> or any Christian Church, had so ample promises as <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> by their names or places. The Romane faith is indeede as I haue said, if wee please to call it so, being vniuersall to all, I meane that faith of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth build her pretended Supremacy, <hi>Tu es Petrus &amp; super hanc Petram fundabo Ecclesiam:</hi> that is, vpon his preceding confession, that Iesus was the Son of God, did Christ found his Church. That faith, I say, hath the infallible promise of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuitie of Gods Spirit, that is, the Candlesticke which neuer shall be voyd of light, the Lampe which shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer want Oyle, the great Citie vpon the Mountaine which shall neuer disappeare, so liuely seene by that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet of the olde Law, &amp; that other of the New, <hi>Ezechiel</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> being both in one extasie, whereof Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> said in his vision in the <hi>Apocolyps, Sustulit me Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>

The Law went out from <hi>Sion,</hi> saith the Apostle: <hi>Et non peribit lex à Sacerdote,</hi> saith the Prophet: She was like vnto <hi>Noah,</hi> who preached vnto two Worlds, as I haue said. And if <hi>Rome</hi> may bragge of Gods promise aboue <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> why hath <hi>Dauid</hi> said in his <hi>Psalme,</hi> to the derogation, not onely to the Mountaines of <hi>Rome,</hi> but of all others,

            <p>Alwaies it is enough by way of comparison: for the first they did both boast of <hi>Templum Domini:</hi> for the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, as it was long before prophesied, that <hi>Ierusalem</hi> should fall away, and become an Adultresse, as the Lord said to <hi>Hosea,</hi> Goe, take vnto thee a Wife of Fornication, <note place="margin">Hos. 1.</note> and Children of Fornication, <hi>Quia fornicando fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur terra ne eat post Iehouam:</hi> Because the whole Land shall be defiled, that it should not follow the Lord. So do we finde in the Euangelicall prophesies of the <hi>Apoc:</hi> a prediction of the falling away of Rome cleere enough: thirdly, as <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> now fallen in her filthinesse, was sayd of the Prophets, to haue a Whores forehead, who would not be ashamed. And againe, the faithfull Citie was become a Harlot: shee who was full of Iustice, was now full of Murthers, her siluer was become drosse, <note place="margin">Esa. 1.</note> her wine mixed with water, her Princes companions of Theeues: euen so, during all this fall of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> there hath neuer beene wanting singular men, whom God did stirre vp to rebuke her for her pollution. And as <hi>Ierusalem</hi> did persecute her Prophets: so hath <hi>Rome</hi> long since persecuted these, euen with cruell mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdome; as, <hi>Ierom Sauanarola</hi> and <hi>Iohn Husse,</hi> in speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, with numbers moe thereafter in diuers Countries: Fourthly, <hi>Rome</hi> is now in that same condition which <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem</hi> was in when the Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> was carryed of <note place="margin">Ezek. 8:</note> the Angell by the hayre from <hi>Babilon,</hi> and placed in the
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:4124:76"/>
inner part of the Church of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> where (saith he) I was commaunded to looke vpon the great Idoll of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, which was in the entrie, whose abhominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, saith the Lord, causeth me to depart from my San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuarie. What other thing, I pray your <hi>Lordship,</hi> is that Idolatrous worship of <hi>Rome,</hi> which I haue related, then a great Idoll of Gods indignation, as it is conioyned with that scandalous impietie of manners. Then further it was saide to <hi>Ezechiel,</hi> Turne thee, and thou shalt see greater abhominations, enter at the gate of the inner Court, and digge a hole through the wall where thou shalt behold similitudes of all abominable things, and all the Idols of the house of <hi>Israel</hi> painted vpon the walles, and thou shalt see the seuentie Ancients of the house of <hi>Israel</hi> standing with <hi>Censours</hi> in their hands, and the vapours of their incense going vp like a Clowde: and yet dost thou not see what they doe in the darke? euery one in the chalmer of his images, saying to himselfe, The Lord hath left the earth, and doth not see any more: And I did see one (saith the Prophet) who stood mourning for <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> Can any thing bee more like to the Colledge of their seuentie Cardinalls, who haue their Palaces throughly adorned with idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous images of all sores, and the Altars within them smoking, with daily incense of ascending vapours: and who can digge a hole through the wall, that is to say, who can see through the clowde of these externall shewes of pietie, to behold the secret practises of their Consistori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Councell, or to behold the works of darknesse which be in their secret Cabinets and sensuall solitudes, hee would assuredly say, that they did also thinke the Lord had left the earth, and did no more see their actions.</p>
            <p>But specially one shall perceiue and consider the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of Ierusalem and Rome, by foure points, rehearsed by the Prophet in his sixteene Chapter. First he doth introduce God, obiecting to her, the weakenesse and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serie of her youth, saying, <hi>O Ierusalem, when thou wast</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Ezech. 16.</note>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:4124:77"/>
               <hi>borne, thy nauell was not cut, thou wast not washed in water to soften thee, and when I saw thee polluted in thine owne blood, I had pitie on thee, and said, thou shouldest liue:</hi> I did sweare vnto thee, and thou becamest <hi>mine.</hi> A viue por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of the first age of the Church of Rome, the first 300. yeeres of her being vnder the crosse from Christ to <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, during all which time, the citie of Rome did lie pitifully defiled with the blood of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles, Saints and Martyrs vnder the persecuting Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours: Secondly, God doth obiect vnto her the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure and beautie whereunto hee had exalted her, and made her the most conspicuous city in the world, saying, <hi>Ierusalem I entered a couenant with thee, and thou becamest mine: I washed the blood from thee, I clothed thee with broy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered worke, I couered thee with silke, I gaue vnto thee brace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, chaines, and all kind of ornaments: I put vpon thy head a beautifull crowne, I made thee eate of fine flower, hony and oyle, and thou grewest vp vnto a kingdome, and thy name was spread:</hi> Which doth most competently figure the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond age of the Church of Rome, now washed from her blood, and put in prosperitie from the dayes of <hi>Constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> to Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, who did vsurpe the vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersall Popedome, and began to erect in it a kingdome, as no man can take exception against it. Thirdly the Lord doth obiect against her by his Prophet, her pride and declination, saying, Ierusalem, thou didst trust in thy beauty, and play the harlot: because of thy renowne, thou hast taken the faire Iewels of gold and siluer, which I gaue thee, and madest Images of them vnto thy selfe: and diddest commit whoredome with them: thou hast taken thy sons &amp; daughters which were borne vnto me, &amp; sacrificed them to be deuoured of those, thou hast not remembred the dayes of thy youth when thou wast na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and bare, Thou hast builded thy high places vpon mounts, and at euery corner of the way thou hast made thy beauty to be abhorred. The application whereof to the present condition of Rome is so conuenient, <hi>Quod
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:4124:77"/>
etiam ipsares loquitur,</hi> One would sweare it had beene a Type of the future estate of Rome, as the Religion was typicall, there was neuer Diademe nor Crowne like vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this which she hath arrogated to her selfe, to bee mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresse and Queene ouer Christian Princes: doe not all the corners of that spacious citie of Rome, and all her seuen mountaines looke out like that glorious palace of <hi>Pryamus,</hi> whereof it was said, <hi>Regia finitimis inuidiosa locis,</hi> There was neuer any artifice comparable with the curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ositie of her three sorts of Images in plate pictures, in imbroyderie on silke and gold, in grauing vpon all sorts of mettals, and vpon fine stones, such as <hi>Porphyre, Agat, Diasper, Lapis Laznli, Cornioll, Alablaster Orientall, Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Christall:</hi> whereof they haue more store then all the world, did any citie euer more forget her obnoxious and distressed youth, oppressing Princes, whose predecessors the Lord made the instrument of her strength and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie. Fourthly God by his Prophet doth pronounce the punishment of Ierusalem, saying, I will stretch out my hand to diminish thy ordinarie. I will gather all these whom thou hast loued, and those whom thou hast hated round about against thee: and will discouer thy filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse vnto them, that they may destroy thee, and burne vp thy houses with fire, because as I liue neither thy sister Sodome, nor her daughters haue done as thou and thy daughters haue done; which doth no lesse agree with the Church of Rome: The Lord hath stretched foorth his hand for her abominations, and hath begun to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish her ordinarie, the puritie of his word which is the onely bread of life, he hath withdrawen from numbers of Christian people, the mutuall loue, concord, and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the Catholike faith, which should be their spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall food; Hath not Rome seene these two ages by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>past, her louers and her enemies gathered against her, to destroy and burne her vp, that is to say; they who were once knit with her, in a perfect vnitie of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike faith, did she not see her owne bowels rent, and
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:4124:78"/>
Christian states and cities persecuted with fire and sword by Christian armies: hath shee not seene the Turkes whom she doth deadly hate, come round about against her in Germanie, Hungarie, Greece, Italie, and with barbarous cruelty ouerthrow both townes and floods of Christian people, and purchase to themselues our fairest Countreys. Is not this to diminish our ordinarie in a fearefull sort for the pride of Rome: while I call it our ordinary, I meane that through the impietie of Rome all these are taken away from the antient splendor, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie and strength of the Catholike Church, whereby she is become more weake.</p>
            <p>Now since Rome and Ierusalem do iumpe in all these points, we will consider a little, whether they may also meete in that which followeth in the Text of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> For fiftly God did limitate his iudgement against Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, saying, This will I still doe till thou cease to play the harlot, and then my iealousie shall depart from thee: I shall confirme to thee for euer the Couenant which I made in thy youth, that thou mayest know that I am God and bee ashamed to open thy mouth any more when I am pacified toward thee, saith the Lord; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by wesee, that whosoeuer God did chastise his Church of Ierusalem with long and hard captiuities, yet he did not altogether abandon her: she was his Church still (albeit now and then a fornicatrix) that euen our Sauiour him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe in his time commaunded to obey them so long as they kept the Chaire of <hi>Moses,</hi> that is, so long as they did speake the trueth: what reason haue we then to dispaire, nor it may please the Lord to reforme the Church of Rome: (so I doe call all these Churches through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Europe that haue receiued the marke of the beast, and are drunke with the cuppe of her fornication to the great derogation of the holy sanctuary of God.) And what know we but it may please God to restore the auncient candour and integritie thereof? the tymes of secret prouidence are vnknowne we reade in the last
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:4124:78"/>
chapter of <hi>Barucke,</hi> that it was said to the people of Israel because of your sinnes you shall be captiue to Babell, and ye shall remaine there manie yeares, euen seauen genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, And after that I will bring you away peaceably from thence, And in the chapter preceding it is sayde <hi>O Ierusalem be of good comfort, and looke towards the East to see thy ioy which commeth from thy God.</hi> The Lord he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>censed some Babilonian Princes to carry them away he inspired others to dismisse them freelie<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to vnderstand then whither apparrantly it will please God to worke so in the hearts of Christian Kings that Rome (who for manie ages hath bene spiritually captiued in Babell) may open her eyes to see the ioyes of God comming from the west, we must trye how this reformation of Israel was, wherevpon proceeded their restitution to Gods fauour, and vpon that are we to settle our iudgement of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation which hath beene or may be in the catholike Church.</p>
            <p>As there was in Israel frequent Apostasies, so was there frequeat reformations, first as both princes and prelats did erre so are they conuicted by the prophets for transgressours, aswell as the people, as we see in the ninth chapter of <hi>Daniel. O Lord (sayth he) open shame belongeth vnto vs, our kings our princes our people our selues, vnto vs all, because we haue sinned.</hi> Secondlie the Reformations which haue beene in Iuda were performed by the ordinarie ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates, Princes, gouernours and Prelats did erre, and princes prelats and gouernours did reforme; The text of <hi>Daniell</hi> sayth. After the going out of the commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement for taking backe the people and reedification of Ierusalem, there were so manie weekes as he doth reckon there, whereby we note that it was not done by any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary meanes, but flowed from a commaundement giuen out. Thirdly we obserue that these reformations were by reducing the church of Ierusalem to the prme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue institutions of Moses, and Gods word: banishing things which had contrarie course, so that for <hi>Daniel</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:4124:79"/>
when he prayeth for reformation and restitution of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem, because (said he) we haue transgressed thy lawe, we haue sinned against thy seruant <hi>Moses:</hi> therefore all these plagues are come vpon vs: hee doth not appeale vnto the church, vnder <hi>Salomon,</hi> vnder <hi>Dauid,</hi> vnder <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> vnder <hi>Ioseph,</hi> or vnder <hi>Iosua,</hi> albeit all these were vpright Rulers of the Church: no, but vnder the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Architype and institution of <hi>Moses.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But while we come to this point of reformation, here it is where the comparison betwixt the Iewish Church, and the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth faile; here it is, <hi>Vbi insaniui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi>

               <hi>omnes:</hi> where, for the greatest part, we are all gone astray. The Prophet <hi>Ezechiel</hi> did see one standing mourning for <hi>Ierusalem:</hi> but (alas) how few doe this day mourne for the Sanctuary? that is to say, for the desperate discords of Christian Churches, who doth out of Christian compassion vtter vnto the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> these kindly speeches of the Prophet to the Israe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites during their captiuitie: My children, as it came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your minde to goe astray from your God, so endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour your selfe ten times more to seeke him (saith the Prophet.) We haue all here forgotten our exemplar, for the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> on the one side (contrary to <hi>Daniel</hi> and the Iewish reformation) she cryeth, that neither she: nor her Prelates, nor her Priests haue transgressed, and that they cannot etre; and therefore they haue no need of reformation. Vpon the other side againe, we, who doe see her abominations, wherewith shee hath defiled the Sanctuary, and corrupted Christian Religion, in place to say with <hi>Daniel,</hi> Lord, turne thy wrath from <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> thy holy Mountaine, haue pittie on thy holy Citie wherethy name was once truely called on. <hi>Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> is a reproach to all that are about her, wee doe cry, because the Church, who was sometimes chaste vnto thee, O Lord, is now become Fornicatrix: therefore destroy her, because shee hath polluted the Catholike saith: therefore diuorce vs from her, O Lord, thus ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

There is a sort of enchaunted Papists, whom the waters of the Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suiticall <hi>absynthyum</hi> haue so venummed, that they will not remit one dramme weight of the superstitious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippe of their great Idoll, if it were for the peace of the whole Sanctuarie, There be againe a Sect of extrauagant and heteroclite Puritans of the late stampe, I speake not of any iudicious good man who doth discharge his fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in Gods feare, and the obedience of his Prince, to Christian education: but of these Anabaptisticall Clerks, <hi>Quiout labouche sans bride,</hi> as the French saith, who carry no bridle in their mouthes, being in opinion of Gouernments whatsoeuer, meerely Republicanes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Architype and order of God, not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spising Princely authoritie, with the Iesuite, but vilipen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding all Prelates in the Church, in fauours of a fantasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Anarchie, or a seditious popular tribunat, forged in their owne braynes, obstinately refusing to accept for doctrine, for manners, for policie, whatsoeuer almost haue beene in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> if it were neuer so good: these be most wretched and pernicious humours of men, carrying factious and vehement spirits, blowne vp with the vapours of <hi>Pandoras</hi> boxe, and abhorring the peace of Israel: with both which I must expostulate in this place, and say vnto them as the Prophet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to cry in the eares of the rebellious Iewes of his time, <hi>Confregistis iugum, rupistis vincula:</hi> you haue disol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued the bands of Catholike loue and vnitie, you haue broken the yoke of Christian societie, you are obstinate against desires of reformation: you doe Iudaise, but <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> did Christianize, who for the sake of that Idolatrous

as they thunder out such tempestuous windes of mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all despight, God will neuer be there to pitty our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian distractions: So long as they raise such vehement commotions and fearefull earth-quakes to rent the states and liues of Christian Princes, God will not be there nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to restore <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and to purge his holy Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the Catholike Church, so long as you burne your selues with fire of mutuall acerbity and wrath, you shall not yet see the Lord there to pitty our Christian dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes, that our Christian Religion bee no longer a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the dangerous multitudes of infidell nations, who watch their opportunitie to assault vs, because as the holy spirit doth testifie in that same place, <hi>Non in commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione Dominus,</hi> the Lord in his mercy cannot be in a commotion, but if you should whisper out this <hi>Sibulus aurae tennis, ibi Dominus:</hi> this gentle and soft ayre of meeknesse and brotherly admonition, there possibly you might finde the Lord.</p>
            <p>Now to the effect that this briefe exhortation, to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose our selues to Christian peace should not bee mista<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and neglected as an indigested phantasie of my braine, I send you all to read that treatise called <hi>Eireni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con sine de pace Ecclesiae,</hi> of the peace of the Church done by that famous <hi>Iunius,</hi> one of the chiefest lights of the Church while he liued, In which treatise he doth call all these of your humour wicked, and seditious Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunes, and of which he did vpon his death-bed protest (as I was informed of those who were present) to haue more comfort, hauing written it immediately before, <hi>Tanquam cantum Cygneum,</hi> as the spirituall song of his farewell: then of all the religious exercises of his life time, which were many and most laborious: So that to imitate for Reformation the practise of our architype Ierusalem, this is the first point which we must obserue with <hi>Daniel,</hi> to make generall confession of our trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gressions, as well Pope and Iesuite, as Puritan: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine to make orations and suppications for all, which
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:4124:82"/>
as it is a thing wee ought to doe, so it is strange how wee should refuse to doe it: while <hi>Daniel</hi> hath said, Lord to vs belongeth open shame, our Kings, our people, our selues. Tis strange of the Papist, that you should affirme, thy Pope and thy Priests are holy and cannot erre, that they haue no need of generall Councells, nor of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Reformation, as if God had taken corruption &amp; mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabilitie from the earth, and granted vs heere a generall beatitude for the sake of Rome. In Gods name let it please you to esteeme your Pope no more holy then <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> was: and if you wish him to be cleansed from his I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry and vniust vsurpations, to be restored againe to the vnity of the Catholike faith, and that dignity which he did once lawfully brooke to be a chiefe Bishop of the occidentall Church: Then must you cry with <hi>Daniel,</hi> O God, to our Pope, our Cardinalls, and Priests, and to vs belongeth open shame, because we haue transgressed against thy seruant <hi>Moses,</hi> euen our great <hi>Moses, Iesus Christ,</hi> who redeemed vs from the bondage of that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Satan. Wee haue turned his faith, and all Religion to superstitious worship: wee haue turned his spirituall gouernment into a Tyranous Monarchy, and we haue turned the piety of Christian manners into ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and abhominion: This must be the voyce of thy confession: And thou protestant if thou wilt wish the increase and restitution of Christs Church, thou must pray for Rome, as <hi>Daniel</hi> did for Ierusalem. Lord be mercifull vnto the holy City, where thy name was once so truely worshipped, thou must teach and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish them, preach, and write to them, as the Prophets did to the Israelites in captiuity; Brethren as it came in your minde to depart from the Lord your God, so wee beseech you to indeuour your selues tenne times more to turne to him againe. If you will deny that Rome is your mother Church, that is nothing, either it is lerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Antioch, Alexandria, Rome, or some other, you cannot deny that shee is your sister Church, who once
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:4124:82"/>
had a concord, and vnity of faith with you, and that by her defection the Catholike Church is greatly weakned: You cannot deny that whiles shee is <hi>fornicatrix,</hi> the Lord doth beget in her sonnes and daughters, who dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly turne vnto him as he did in Ierusalem, when hee said to his Prophet <hi>Hosea,</hi> Goe yet and loue a woman that was an harlot according to the loue of God toward Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, for she looked after strange Gods, and I bought her with siluer, &amp;c. You cannot deny but those who did possesse the chiefest functions in our Church the times of reformation, that they had their calling deriued from the Church of Rome, and those who receiued calling from them; By the Church of Rome, I meane as before, those Churches that receiued not the true faith so much at first, as at last corruption and Idolatry from her, who consenting therein with her may bee called after her name: You cannot deny that our Ancestours who now liue, in whose faith we were baptised, that they had their Baptisme from the Church of Rome, and that Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment truely administred there, not in the name of the Church of Rome, but in the name of the Father Sonne and holy Ghost, therefore our fathers were neuer pressed by any reformed Church to be rebaptised, That confession of <hi>S. Peter</hi> that Iesus was the sonne of God, no man can deny that it is the faith of Rome, corrupted indeed with Idolatrous worship, &amp; she hath fallen from her spouse Christ to play the harlot. Shall ye not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as a member of one body with her, as a kinde bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or sister pitty her disease? will ye answere me to this, that she is obstinate, reprobate, hath stopped her eares with the serpent so that she cannot heare, but how doe you know when God hath appointed her to heare? con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider the calling of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> and in what termes that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which entered into him did send him to the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> and in his 2. and 3.

               <hi>from the east,</hi> thy people who were caried in captiuitie for their Idolatrie, turning backe reioycing in the word of the holy one to the honour of their God saith the Text. <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was but our Type and shaddow, she fell from God so absolutely, that <hi>Hosea</hi> saith <hi>Ierusalem</hi> for many yeares, shall neither haue Prince, priest, sacrifice nor Prophet, because in her captiuitie she durst not pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise her owne Idolatries, So that neuer Church was in more fearefull and desperate condition, yet the Lord did restore her; whereupon we haue reason to hope that hee will in his mercie more fauour the body, vnlesse our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude and transgressions doe close the doore of his mercie.</p>
            <p>The second point which we note in the Reformation of <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is, that they were performed by ordinary <note place="margin">The reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ierusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem done by ordinary Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrates.</note> meanes of lawfull Princes and Prelates; The Prophets indeed whom God appointed to be watchmen ouer the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> they were extraordinarily called. but the worke was wrought by ordinary Gouernours, for in that place of <hi>Daniel</hi> we read, that after his prayers for all, the Angell <hi>Gabriel</hi> appeared vnto him, reuealing vnto him the designed time of their restitution, by certain circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, saying, betwixt the going out of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement for taking back of the people, and reedifying of Ierusalem, and betwixt the comming of Messias the Prince, there shall be seuen weekes, and threescore and tenne weekes, &amp;c. where he shewes how that restitution and reformation of Ierusalem, proceeded from one or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance giuen to Princes and Prelates, who did enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize it, as wee see testified by the Spirit of God in that restitution made by <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of Persia, who did pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime it in these words, The Lord God of heauen hath giuen me all the kingdomes of the earth, and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:4124:83"/>
mee to build him a house in Ierusalem, who is among you, with whom his God is, let him goe vp to Ierusalem and build the house of the Lord. Where he himselfe professed to haue a warrant from God as su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme King, who had power to performe it. And againe that hee did not depute to that discharge euery man, or any man indifferently, no, but hee with whom God is, and who were such it is subioyned in the Text: Then the chiefe Fathers, and the Priests and Leuites rose vp to goe to the worke. And <hi>Cyrus</hi> King of Persia brought foorth by the hand of <hi>Mithridate</hi> his Thesaurour, the vessels of the house of the Lord, and counted them on to <hi>Zorobabel</hi> Prince of Iudea, and made the people to be furthered and strengthened by siluer, gold, cattell and substance of his owne subiects. Tis cleere that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission was giuen to the Princes and to the Prelates; it was not done by priuate pretenders, nor by sedition, nor insurrection; the people did endure the yoake of bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage till it pleased the Lord to reforme Ierusalem by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Magistrates and meanes, a point that howsoeuer is is expressely to beimitated and followed in Christian reformations, yet such hath beene the times fore-past, that diuerse haue beene forced to doe contrary to the same, partly for want of patience to attend Gods secret appointments, or through the feruours of zeale, and partly through the intollerable pride of Rome who would neuer hearken to any voice of Reformation, tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the which, and the pretenders of extraordinary vocation I will not meddle to speake, because I am no extraordinarie Diuine, onely this by the way. Two <note place="margin">Of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Church.</note> things doe appeare to me, one, that such pretexts haue e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beene the fountaine of all disorder and nouelties in the Church. For whence haue Arrianisme, Pelagianisme, and those other flowed of old; and whence of late Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptisme, Brownisme, and besides those so many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cussions and afflictions as we haue seene mooued within this kingdome, by those who vrged the Geneua disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:4124:84"/>
to bee accepted for a third essentiall note of the Church. From whence came all these? but from singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of opinion, and from holy pretenders, whereof the meanest would take vpon him to affirme that
<q>
                  <l>A Christian true albeit a country clowne,</l>
                  <l>May teach a King to weare a Scepter and a Crowne:</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So that so long as extraordinary calling shall bee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended or permitted, that spring of curious and Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine impieties shall neuer be stopped, as may be seene in <hi>Holland,</hi> which is become a <hi>Prostibulum</hi> of damnable se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctaries pretending the holy spirit for their dreames. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine for another, it appeares looking vpon the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God, that there is no backe doore left for such dangerous Reformatours; God doth indeed frequently illuminate the hearts of men with vprightnesse and true knowledge amidst vniuersall ignorance, that such may perswade, write and insinuate, why not? but to intrude themselues into the Church, or to attempt Reformation, I know not how, euen the Prophets of the old Law who had the extraordinary spirit, they would not goe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime publikely against manifest Idolaters, but when the Angell of God did specially send them. There bee times when God will not vouchsafe his light to men as <hi>S. Matthew</hi> saith, <hi>Ne Sancta dentur canibus, &amp; Margaritae porcis proijciantur:</hi> that holy things should not bee giuen <note place="margin">Matth. 7.</note> to Dogges, nor pearles cast before swine. And speaking of the Apostolicall times, I thinke they are deceiued who say, that <hi>Titus</hi> or <hi>Timothie</hi> had an extraordinary vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; for they were chosen by the Apostle, and were the Schollers of <hi>S. Paul, Quae accepi à Domino</hi> (saith hee) <hi>catradidivobis,</hi> The things which were taught to mee by our Master Christ, these haue I teached you. Yea, doe we not see how in the very time of the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues when the extraordinary spirit was giuen to many, there was iealous warnings among them against extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie Pretenders: <hi>Audiuimus quosdam ex nobis &amp;c.</hi> we heare (saith the Apostle) that some haue gone out from

Briefely this extraordinary Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation hath neuer in no time beene seene, but accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with such miraculous graces as did sufficiently warrant it from doubt or calumnie: which makes mee thinke, that hee who is in this Libertine and corrupted age will pretend extraordinarie calling, he had neede to qualifie the same by extraordinary markes: The Lord God indeede who Master of all creation, of all redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of all Reformation, and for common doth worke by naturall and ordinary meanes in all these three, when he will to shew his power and glory, he will worke aboue and contrary to Nature, and to her order, as hee made the Red Sea to diuide for <hi>Moses,</hi> and the Sunne to be fixed for his successour <hi>Iosua,</hi> as he suffered by way of reformation the Asmoner to be for the time both Kings and Priests in one person, as nature it selfe following the same doing of God her Soueraigne Lord, albeit for the ordinary she worketh to procreation and generation of things, yet sometimes she workes deuouring inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and pestilent plagues, which although they seeme to destroy, yet they are necessary purgers of nature for the time, euen so there hath beene in the beginnings of Christian reformation extraordinary things done, by <note place="margin">Reformation of Christian Churches.</note> good men in case of so great exigence and necessitie as was; but these extrauagant interims are neuer to bee drawen in rule: The tyranny of Rome hath enforced that kinde of doing, the cruell martyrdome first of <hi>Sauo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uarola</hi> and then of <hi>Hus,</hi> for their cries of Reformation: their deceiuing of <hi>Caroliu</hi> 5. and two succeeding Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors in their designs of reformation; their barbarous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution of the Protestants of France and Germany, by

               <p>A limitation of the Primitiue Church: whereunto we are to appeale for Reformation, which the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the best Reformators touching the meanes thereof.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>BVt to proceede touching the Primitiue Church, I say that whatsoeuer is in the Church, it is either Doctrine, Policie, or Ceremonies: what concernes doctrine doth limitate the Primatiue Church to the dayes of Christ, the Apostles and Euangelists, that nothing is to be admitted for doctrine but that, which the Spirit of God did penne by their hands; what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes euery particular Act in policie or custome in Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, it is not to be reckoned so. To make this <note place="margin">Distinct: of diuine Institut:</note> cleere, we are to vnderstand a distinction in diuine insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, some being more directly diuine then others, as the doctrinal points of Saluation treated by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, are more diuine, then that which the same Apostles did, concerning the policie. The first is the bread of life it selfe, the second is but the order how it shall be kept &amp; dispensed, so that these things which our Sauiour spake out of his owne mouth are immediately diuine. The Acts againe of the Apostles in establishing the Church after the ascension, no man will refuse them to be diuine institutions, so farre, that the Apostles might say they did proceed from the holy Ghost, and from themselues, yet no man either must hold them equally diuine with the personall doctrine of Christ, in regard whereof, they hold a second degree, &amp; are called Apostolike Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: Therfore such as be strict about this distinctio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, say, that which did immediatly flow from Christ himselfe, is a diuine ordinance, and the other onely <hi>diuini Iuris,</hi> that is to say, hath a diuine right. Now say they, in regard of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:4124:87"/>
the first institution, the difference is but small betwi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>t a diuine ordinance, and an Apostolicall ordinance, but in respect of continuation or perpetuitie, there is a great discrepance, that which is immediately diuine, being absolutely and unchangeably necessarie to bee kept in the Church, from Christs mouth to the consummation of the world. The other againe not so, but as it did not flow directly from Christs owne mouth, nor from the Apostles, immediately after the ascension, but being traditions politicall for the Church, they were peece and peece deliuered and practised according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of the faith; euen so they do not imply a necessary perpetuitie in the Church in that sort as some do fondly reason, saying, if such Policie, or such Ceremonies be A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postolicall, then they must be perpetuall in the Church, wherevpon (by way of aduantage) they inferre the nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of many reformed Churches in France, Scotland, Geneua, and others, which is an absurd inconvenient. O, but it is not so: The word of God, and the Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall traditions be of like ve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>itie, but not of like autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, nor like perpetuitie, nor a like necessitie; for that is to bee retained in the Church, which is expedient and convenient, as wel as that which is absolutely necessary, but the difference is, that of Christs word one Iot shall not perish, it is vnchangeable, incorruptible &amp; eternall. Whereas these other Apostolicall institutions, which were the fountaines and beginnings, from whence did flow the growth of the Churches policie, with the grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the faith vnder the successors of the holy Fathers of the primitiue Church, these I say, albeit they be from the spirit of veritie, yet hauing but a second place, and being but <hi>diuini Iuris,</hi> they are not so absolute incorrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible and vnchangeable as the first: they are like vnto vpright gold into which an excellent Iewell is mounted, there to be kept, which gold, if it were most fine, it is with time worne, diminished, altered, and perhaps bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but still againe renewed: euen so as the Riuers,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:4124:88"/>
which after long running doe willingly fall againe into the bosome of their great fountaine, the Ocean, from whence they come and which is their naturall seat; so all disordered and strange courses of pretended policies and nouelties of the Church gouernment, do by length of time returne againe into the fountaine of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stolicall institutions (as experience doth shew) which are not to bee limited to the daies of Christ, or to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of the Apostles, as the word is, but vnto the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiue Church vnder the Apostles, and their Successors, during the first three or foure hundred yeeres of her pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, so that from the estate of the Church in that time, are all our Reformations to be sought apparantly; and what we haue transgressed against that, is to bee referred againe, and ruled by that, and by no later times.</p>
            <p>Albeit generall Councells and great numbers of learned men were more frequent thereafter, for all the world doth know, that as learning grew, so grew corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and so grew curiositie to couer the same, so grew contention, ambition, and heresie. To proue by many arguments the sinceritie of the Primitiue Church, or the reasons why wee should appeale to her for reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is not necessarie: The holy and great Doctor <hi>S. Augustine</hi> giueth such a testimonie, as leaueth no sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion; that, saith he, which the holy primitiue Church obserued, although it was not concluded by Counsells, but alwaies retayned, <hi>non nisi authoritate Apostolica tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum</hi> 
               <note place="margin">August. de bap: contra Donat: lib. 4. cap. 24.</note> 
               <hi>rectissime creditur,</hi> it is most rightly beleeued to haue been no other then an Apostolicall institution. Againe, saith he, to dispute whether that which the holy primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church through the world did obserue, should bee now receiued, or not receiued, <hi>insolentissimae est insaniae,</hi> it is a most mad insolence. In which wee marke these two: First, that hee doth not limitate the primitue Church to the daies of Christ and his Apostles, but hee speaketh of a primitiue Church flourishing throw the world: Secondly, that he doth not tye the credit of the
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:4124:88"/>
primitiue Church, to the authoritie neither of Councels, although hee saith, it was not concluded in Councells. Yea farther, all the Councells themselues which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the primitiue Church, did cloath them with the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie thereof, their Meetings, Registers, Decrees, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall letters, and whatsoeuer was, were founded vpon this, <hi>secundum veterem consuetudinem Patrum nostrorum,</hi>

For example, long before the Councell of Nice, the patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archall Bishops were in authoritie, albeit there was no such thing in the daies of the Apostles, because there was then no combination of Prouinces conuerted to the faith; and in that Councell it was called an ancient cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome. And in the Councell of Ephesus there was a question decided betwixt a patriarchall Bishop, and the Bishop of Cyprus, where any man may see if it was not said, <hi>Secundum vetus decretum Patrum nostrorum.</hi>

            <p>And certainely it is an infallible argument of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegritie and vpright meaning which hath been in the proto-reformators of Germanie, to heare their willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse to follow antiquitie, where it was not contrarie to Gods word. These are the speeches of <hi>Luthor,</hi> and <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer,</hi> touching the retentions of indifferent ceremonies of the Church of Rome, <hi>Sciant publica pacis causa non de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracturos &amp;c.</hi> we will not (say they) be against the broo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of ceremonies and traditions receiued in the Popes Church from antiquitie vpon these conditions, that the consciences of men be not thereby bound, as by funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall grounds of faith: but that the doctrine Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall, of free iustification by faith in Christ, remaine inuiolate: and that, say they, not only speaking of festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall daies, musicke, organs, clericall vestiments, which be things indifferent, <hi>sed etiam de ieiunio &amp; ciborum delectu qua magis pungunt,</hi> but also touching fasting and choyce of meats, which be more controuerted points.

to many malignant, and seditious spirits, which be now in Christs Church? who haue no voyces, as I haue said, but of debate and contradiction, contending for Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasticke tryumph and victorie, in place to cry to Gods people, that which the Prophets were commanded, to cry, <hi>Ann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And consequently dissention in religion dissention in the state, therefore out of that spirit of Christian loue which God willeth to rule vs, I wish all men to dispose themselues to this happie Vnion, and to reuerence this time wherein we are, and whereof the chiefest mystery is not yet seene: albeit the seale thereof be alreadie opened and we haue alreadie seene miraculous things; If we doe Christianly simpathize with the time to honour these glorious preambles of a generall reformation, which God doth set a worke by the erection of the Monarchie of great Britaine in the Royall Person of our most graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Soueraigne, and if we can turne the ambitious craft of the <hi>Iesuite</hi> into a Christian wisdom against himself, that as he striueth to reduce the whole world vnder the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie of his High Priest; So we may with the force of v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited mindes assist the rising and encrease of this great Kingdome, in the hope of a generall restauration of Christs Church, what know we what God intendeth yet to bring about by this mighty Prince, whose exaltation, in the prouidence of the Almightie, hath already brought the whole world in admiration: what know we what he who did so long Prophesie by the mouth of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy,</hi> the comming of <hi>Cyrus</hi> to restore Ierusalem, he who made <hi>Cyrus</hi> at his comming to cry, the Lord God of heauen hath giuen me the kingdomes of the earth, that I should build a house to him in Ierusalem, what know we what he hath propounded to doe by this vertuous Monarch, whom he hath so extraordinarily raised, and made him Master of puissant Kingdomes, what can we iudge of those currant prophesies of our fore fathers for his being Emperour, and for his ransacking of the wals of Rome, doe not we see how he hath already begunne to shake those wals, and to breake the hornes of that Beast; Let no man be so simple as to doubt, but one day God hath predestinate by some Christian <hi>Cyrus</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that city, and to restore his people from that spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall captiuity; Yea, let no man doubt but that the time

of that great Iubile doth approach, (as I will shew heere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after) If wee by our obstinate distractions and diuision doe not preuent it, and therefore thou who abhorrest a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny law or ordinance which may tend to a firme coniun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of this Isle, or who doest repine in any sort against that great instrument whom God hath sent to reforme his Church, thou shalt be infinitely blessed of God, if by thy conformity thou can once take away that greeuous imputation of the Papist, who to the reproach of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell doth affirme thus; That after <hi>Luther</hi> who was that <hi>Nimrod</hi> (as he saith) that enterprized the tower of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie against the Apostolicall seate of Rome; all those who did concurre to that building were (like vnto those sons of <hi>Adam</hi> who builded Babylon) punished of God with confusion of tongues, that one did not vnderstand ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; All the followers of <hi>Luther</hi> Lutherians, Semi Luth.

            <argument>
               <p>A Triall of the best and surest Policies which bee in Nature, in Ciuility, in Oëconomy, in Morality.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>IN matter of <hi>Doctrine</hi> we make one ptofession with the Church of England founded vpon the purity of Gods word. The oddes be either in the Church policie or in some indifferent ceremonies, I speake of oddes in poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licie, by reason of you, who be opponents in your hearts to the State of Bishops: So before I will touch the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, I will deale with you vpon that head: As for the Theologicall and more subtile disputarion of the Theme of Episcopall Regiment, it is so exactly done by diuers reuerend and learned Diuines, that it hath not much neede of my contribution, only I will select some cleere, sincere and most disiestable arguments for your information, and because many of you who bee thus distracted, haue neuer tasted the pure fountaines of true and naturall knowledge, which is not the least cause of your Errour, therefore I will shew you into this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, what is the gouernment which God did plant in the creation of nature, and what affinity it hath with such policies as haue since followed and fallen out through the world in Church or in state, whereinto, if I doe a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle insist to expresse the lawfulnes and vertue of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchall Rule,</hi> it is not to induce a Monarchall gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Church which is a Popish inuention, and heere also sufficiently answered. But first it is to poynt foorth the power of God in <hi>annointed Kings,</hi> against the pernicious doctrine of those, who teach the contempt and violation of Kingly authority: And secondly it is to shew, that as God did frame the gouernment of his first Church of the Iewes, not much vnlike to that of nature, euen so if we seeke the originall Idaea of true ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:4124:93"/>
policy, in the right Horoschope, and if we pronounce it with a right aire, we shall find, and we may say it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, that the first image of whatsoeuer gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment agreeable to Gods will, hath beene conceiued into nature, in the order whereof God hath auoyded two things, and hath reserued one peculiar to himselfe, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute soueraigntie or a power meerely vnicall: and an Anarchie or popular confusion, neither of these two hath he willed, that as on the one part no creature should haue a <hi>Monarchall Supremacie,</hi> exempted from necessarie cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence, and simpathie with dependent members, so on the other side no indiuiduall parts of one kinde, might subsist without a head, through whom they must receiue the order and direction of their motions: The vnity againe of absolute <hi>Supremacie</hi> in heauen and earth, God hath concluded within the Center of his diuine throne proper to himselfe, that no particular Creature in nature can be capable thereof, so that it is equally ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous to say, the Lyon cannot be cheife of beasts, vnlesse the Indian, Libian and Barbarian Lyons, bee all subiect to one Monarchall Lyon: The Kings of the earth cannot be lawfull Kings, vnlesse there be one supreme Monarch ouer them all, which cannot bee in any but in God, the Primates of nationall Churches cannot bee lawfull Bishops, vnlesse they bee vnited vnder one Hierarchie, which cannot bee in any one person but in <hi>Iesus Christ</hi> the second person of the Trinity. And as wee see in na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the more excellent creatures tied by a wonderfull simpathie to their inferiours, that they are rather fathers to them, then Dominatours ouer them, as the supernall spheares make perpetuall influctions in the body of the Moone, to maintaine her operation, and as the Element of the fire doth purge the aire below it, and nourish the earth with continuall heate. So we see a vertuous Prince vnder the name of a Monarch, he doth infuse his power into the chiefest of his members, and maketh his Rule in effect Aristocraticke, euen so in the Church vnder
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:4124:93"/>
predominate names of Bishop, Archbishop Metropoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tane, the gouernment is Monarchall in Christ the head, Aristocraticke in the Bishops, and Democraticke, in the Presbyters and laye Elders, by their mutuall harmonie, as is hereafter more a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ply declared: Thus is nature the Fountaine of knowledge vnder God, and the fittest schoole to rectifie our iudgements, chiefly in matter of Policie, because the Lord hath manifested himselfe in his workes, letting vs see how one miraculous hand, and not two, hath framed them by one miraculous Artifice, and not two; to one end, and not to two, breathing moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in them from one spirit, and not from two, subiecting them to one law, and not to two, and to one sort of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment, and not to two: as he is God <hi>One,</hi> and vnited in himselfe; so hath he vnited them Symbolically among themselues, &amp; all conioyned to be the Symbal of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, power, and wisedome: So that what naturall instincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we find among brute beasts for order, or for subiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and commandement: it is a type to vs of that rule which is among the Elements, the Elementall gouerne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a figure of that which is among the Celestiall Spheares, and that againe doth represent the Angelicall policie, and all those considered coniunctly are a shadow of that rule which God hath ouer the vniuerse. <hi>Regis ad exemplum totus componitur orbis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To proceed for the vertue of the Monarchie, I found my first argument for it in this sort; These Creatures which are neerest to God, are of most noble and perfect of nature, for example: That Spheare which is next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the throne of God, called by the Cabbalists the great <hi>Metatron,</hi> which receiueth the tenne seuerall emanati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of God to be distributed among the tenne Spheares, called of them, <hi>Decem Zephiroth,</hi> to make from them seuerall influences into the inferiour world, who doth doubt but that Spheare and the great Archangel, who moueth it, are more excellent creatures then the Spheare of the Moone, or the manner thereof, which is called of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:4124:94"/>
the Philosophers, <hi>Coelum terrestre &amp; terra coelestis,</hi> a hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly earth, and a terrestriall heauen; because it is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Creature betwixt coelestiall and Elementar things, for as the fire is the Masculine Element or the Agent which giueth life to inferiour things: and the earth Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minine or patient who doth receiue this life, so the globe of the Moone is the Feminine of that high Spheare, who receiueth in her bellie these celestiall influxions, and (as pregnant of them) doth deliuer them monethly as wee see, being in that sort farre inferiour to the excellence of the other: and as it is in Creatures, that the neerest to God is most excellent, so it is in the order of Creatures, that action which doth resemble the action of God is most perfect: Now for the <hi>Hypothesis</hi> I subsume, that there is not so noble a Creature of God, as is the holy v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuerse; and therefore no gouernment is more excellent then that whereby the world is gouerned, which is the Monarchiall power of God himselfe, who is Lord ouer all, for to those who will hold that the rule of God is A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ristocraticke, by reason of the Trinitie: I answere, that the works of God which be <hi>Ad extra,</hi> as the Theologes speake: They proceede, <hi>à Deo tanquam vno, &amp; non tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam Trino.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Vnder this supreme rule of God, we do obserue Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchiall gouernment, both in the constitutions seuerall of the vniuerse, and in the administrations seuerall of the vniuerse: In the constitutions this way, all the seuerall Creatures of the world are vnder the vnity, and common instinction of generall nature one mother of all: All the accidents of one subiect vnder one vnitie thereof, things many in number be vnder the vnitie of <hi>vna species.</hi> All men vnder the <hi>Species</hi> of mankind, all horses vnder the <hi>Species</hi> of that kind, and so foorth: Things that bee many in kind againe, bee all vnder one gender; Man, Beast and Plant are <hi>Animalia,</hi> and feele a common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct of that <hi>Genus:</hi> In the seuerall administrations wee doe obserue it thus, The seuerall persons of the glorious

Trinitie be in one Godhead. All these tenne <hi>Zephiroth,</hi> receiue their vertues from the supreme <hi>Metatron,</hi> and all the Spheares doe obey the motion of one <hi>Primum mobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le:</hi> so that we haue the supreme Archangel <hi>Michael,</hi> ouer the powers and orders Angelicall, who is Christ, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he is called the Angell of the <hi>Great Counsell, Et vocabitur m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

It rests to consider these gouernements which bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, and they are either Spirituall or Temporall, Temporall is either priuate or publike, priuate is it which we call morall, or a mans rule ouer himselfe, and to speake first of that, it is meerely Monarchiall, because it is done by reason as a King. The Philosophers doe esteeme euery wise man to be a Monarch; and the first among Kings, <hi>Sapiens vno minor est Ioue, Rex deni<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

                  </expan> Regum:</hi> That no King was greater then a wise man but <hi>Iupiter: Multoties reges siratio te rexerit:</hi> saith <hi>Seneca,</hi> You shall be many wayes a king, if you can be king ouer your selfe: yea, the Spirit of God in the Apocalips saith, as much as these Philosophers, <hi>Fecisti nos Deo nostro reges &amp; Sacer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes,</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Apoc. 5.</note> You haue made vs Kings and Priests vnto God: certaine there cannot be a more princely rule, nor more difficill, then to daunt the dissordered passions of our spirits, which as a seditious popular doe still perturbe the tranquillity of the mind, if reason do not sit in his throne aboue their neckes to punish those. <hi>Bestias animae</hi> called by <hi>Plato:</hi> The temporal gouernment publike; of men, it is either Oeconomicall or Politicall: Oeconomicall is the rule of a family, and it is meerely soueraigne: one man is master ouer the company of one house: politicall is a rule of many families which make Cities, Countreyes, Kingdomes, of all the sorts whreof, the Monarchie (I say for the first) is most perfect, because it comes neerest vnto the rule of God in the constitution of nature. For the next I reason thus; There be in nature three kinds of Creatures; some with fewe meanes doe compasse small good, as the vermine of the earth which be imperfect Creatures, some more perfect by many meanes doe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine greater good, as man: some lastly most perfect with few meanes doe attaine greatest happinesse as Angels: these that haue the most excellent and supreme dignitie doe the same, as that Archangell that turneth the Spheare of the first <hi>Mobile,</hi> is said to mooue it in euery minute of the hower of foure and twentie howers, while
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:4124:95"/>
as there be 60. minutes in euery howre 500000. leagues, which is the reason why we must count him a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect creature then that Angell who ruleth the globe of the Sunne; much narrower then the other, and taketh no lesse then a whole yeare for his course. Summarily of diuers things which ayme at one marke, that is most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent which doth most easily and most swiftlie at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayne the same; I subsume that of all formes of gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Monarchie doth most preuaile that way, and I proue it thus:</p>
            <p>Gouernment doth shew it selfe in three things: first, in the power and authoritie of those who commaund. secondly, in the diuturnitie of estate: thirdly, in the large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of dominion. For the first, I say that authoritie hath greater force where it is absolute and vnite, then where it is dispersed and limited. Naturall reason doth stand for it, <hi>vis vnita fortior,</hi> experience doth approue it. That statelie popular Common-weale of Rome in case of any notable danger was constrained to distrust hir ordinarie Magistrates, and to betake her selfe to the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute and vnite power of the Dictator, as <hi>Liuie</hi> saith, <hi>Videat Dictator ne quid Respub: detrimenti capiat,</hi> let the Dictator prouide, that the Common-weale incurre no euill. which Dictatorship was a most soueraigne and powerfull authoritie for the time, and when at length that flourishing Common-wealth became mightie and great, there was no forme of gouernment could suffice to keepe it in good estate, vntill it did againe peece and peece turne to a Monarchie, first creating Dictators vpon occasions, and by intermission of time, next crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>Pompey</hi> onely Consul. thirdly, <hi>Caesar Dictator in perpetuum.</hi> And <hi>Augustus</hi> was receiued in the state abso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Monarch. And the greatest part of the Common-wealths of the earth this day, which be either Aristocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall (that is to say, where a selected number of the most worthy doe gouerne) as at Venice, or which be Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craticall, (that is to say, meerely popular) as at Genua,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:4124:96"/>
they are forced to acknowledge a certaine soueraigntie by establishing of a Duke. For the second, touching diu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnitie of States, Sparta was of the longest continuance eight hundred yeeres; as for Venice, which doth reckon eleuen or twelue hundred yeares, that is true, for the part of their Cittie, by reason of the strength thereof by sea, but their State hath been oftentimes altered, as their Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries doe record, and the gouernment it selfe frequently changed, being for the first Tribunitiall or popular, next vnder a Duke more absolute then hee is now, then by little and little it became Aristocraticall, vntill in the yeare 1217. it came to this present condition wherein the great Councell was closed, and doth since admit no increase of their number. Sparta howsoeuer it seeme to be Respub: by limitation of their Kings to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the <hi>Ephori,</hi> yet in actions of warfare and danger his authoritie was absolute: so that euen the Republicks in matters of weight and importance, they were forced to relie vpon Soueraigntie. In the meane time in place of one Cittie which hath stood three or foure hundred yeares, there be numbers of Monarchies which haue en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured a thousand or twelue hundred yeares. The Assy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians more then 1300. yeares. Prester Iohn had his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning before the incarnation, and doth yet remaine flourishing. The Romane Empire which I count Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchicall, 1600. The kingdome of China is said to be 2300. And of all those of Europe the Royall Crowne of the house of Scotland knowne to bee infallible of greatest antiquitie.</p>
            <p>For the third concerning largenesse of domination, the Monarchie hath that way the greatest aduantage. Diuers kingdoms haue been of more large and spacious Territories then the dominions of the Romane Empire, and many haue been equall. More large were the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions of the Assyrians, Medes, Persians, Greekes, and of the Scythians, yea forbearing to talke of antiquitie, the Ottomanicall Empire is more extended then was
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:4124:96"/>
that of Rome. Rome was dilated from Atlant to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, 1200. myles, from the streight of Gibalter to Euphrates 3000 myles, whereas the Turkish doth lye 4000. in length, and in bredth 3500. from Asna to Asaph, from Tauris to Buda, from Balsara to Algar. Moreouer the Romane territories were yet more ample vnder the Emperor then before Augustus, there do this day beare rule in Asia, great Cam and the great Mogor, whereof euery one may put into the fields three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thousand horse. The great Duke of Muscouia whose bounds doe reach in length 1800. and in bredth 1600. And in the Spanish domination we haue a great example of Monarchicall vertue, which doth in large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse equall many Empires that hath been, except that it is weake by disiunction alwaies to brooke dispersed states among diuersities of people, languages, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in the ancient and new found world vnder both poles, possessing the most rich Prouinces of Europe in the eyes of strong and dangerous emulators, it proues the Monarchiall rule to bee matchles and most solide. Briefly for one Repub: there be great numbers of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities throughout Europe, Venice, Genua, Raguzia, Luca, Geneua, with the Cantons of the Swissers and Gri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and 60. Townes in Almanie which be free, all the Remanant being possessed in Monarchie. In Asia and Africa, wee heare of no gouernment but soueraigne, so that Monarchie doth in effect draw vnder it the whole world after the instinct of nature, which is the reason why the greatest Clerks &amp; Statesmen both, do hold that God &amp; nature do fauor the increase of Monarchie, more then of any other state, and we marke it ordinarily, and it commeth also to passe sometimes, by meanes which can neuer be incident in Republicks, as many Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities falling in one by the lot of Succession and heyres of one house, which hath within these few yeares won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully enlarged the Crowne of Spaine, by the conflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of diuers Kingdomes and Seigniories into it, as Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:4124:97"/>
into one Ocean, and as our most fortunate Isle of Great Brittaine hath been lately erected into a puissant Monarchie, by the like coniunction of diuers kingdoms, aspiring in the strength of these to greater height, which things could neuer arriue into a Repub: <hi>quia non moritur Respub: nec habet heredes,</hi> the Common-wealth dieth not, nor hath any heyres as Kings doe. Moreouer wee collect by the holy Scripture, that the dilatation of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires is a benediction of God, which since it falleth out by monarchie, therefore vnto it must also appertaine the blessing. The reason of this is, because the plurali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of pettie Princes and Estates, doe make them com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to liue in aemulation and strife, and make great subiects to be insolent and contentious, which breedeth ciuill discord, and often times distraction in religion, grieuances and annoyances of people, so farre that wee read how multitude of Princes is permitted by God for the punishment of our sinnes.</p>
            <p>As this point now is true, that the vertuous effects of Monarchicall gouernment doe approue the lawfulnesse of it, so doth the holy Scripture confirme the same. Christ himselfe commanded to obey Caesar, the two Archiapostles Peter, and Paul from his inspiration did teach the same.

number was <hi>Annamas,</hi> and <hi>Agabus</hi> endued with prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall spirits, to impart to the Church diuers reuelations which they had.</p>
            <p>Touching these againe who were thereafter called <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscopi &amp; Presbiteri,</hi> we see that in the Apostles daies the Church was a while without them: the first mention of of that order we finde it in the Church of Ierusalem, in the twelfth of the Acts; for so long as the Apostles and Euangelists did remaine, there was neither <hi>Episcopus</hi> nor <hi>Presbyter,</hi> but after they were disseuered <hi>Iames</hi> being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed, and <hi>Peter</hi> fled, then did they enter, &amp; from that forth, <hi>Luke</hi> doth coniunctly report of them with the Apostles: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> so like vnto himselfe in all his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, we cannot thinke that without a reason in his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle to the Philipians, hee hath giuen salutation to the <hi>Episcopi</hi> and <hi>Diaconi,</hi> and hath not done so in the rest of his Epistles. In that Epistle to the Romanes, hee salutes diuers whom he calles his <hi>co-operarij,</hi> or fellow labourers as <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Vrbanus,</hi> famous among the Apostles. And of the Domestick Church which was some while at Ephesus, and somewhile at Corinth, to these hee giues <note place="margin">Acts 19. 28.</note> them their owne praises, yet doth he not call them <hi>Epis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copi</hi> nor <hi>Presbyteri,</hi> as hee doth <hi>Epaphroditus</hi> in that to the Philipians: And <hi>Archippus</hi> in that to the Colossians, when hee came to Rome, we read how hee was recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, but by no <hi>Presbiteri,</hi> which had not beene omitted, if that ordination had beene then among them, more then it is omitted in the 15. and 21. of the Acts, where he is said to be receiued of Presbyters, all this time there was no <hi>Presbiteri</hi> yet planted other then <hi>Timothy, Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, Apollo, Luke; Stephen, Fortun.

Where none was found worthy of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scopall charge, that place did remaine without a Bishop, for they being no great multitude of beleeuers, saith he, they were no great numbers found capable of the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterat, therefore the Church at that time did rest vnder the Apostolike Bishopricke till with time things grew to greater perfection; in which words we doe obserue this, that in the beginning while the Apostolicall mission was limited to Iudea, Christ did onely chuse 12. Apostles, and 70. Disciples, but after the Legation was generall both to Iew and Gentile, they tooke vnto them <hi>co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rij,</hi> Euangelists, Prophets and others, and when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spell beganne to spred they did institute Episcopi and Presbyteri: So that Christs Church was planted by the like beginnings, and had the like growth of policie as that of Ierusalem; both hauing their originall in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons of <hi>Moses</hi> the figure, and Christ the man figured, and both with time diuoluing by little and little into a diuersity of subordinate rulers, of whom the Apostle set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth downe the cleere distinction and imparity, giuing the first place to Apostles, the second to Euangelists, the third to Prophets, the fourth to Pastours, and the last to Doctours. Whereof the first of the number <hi>Apostolus</hi> doth comprehend in it as in <hi>genere,</hi> these whole species, ennumerated of spirituall functions, so that euery Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle was also a Doctour but notreciprocally.</p>
            <p>By these we doe manifestly see that Christ in the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Church, did follow for gouernment, the same Architype which was giuen vnto <hi>Moses,</hi> and that one God hath but one meaning of one order in matter of Policie, as I haue sayd; for if ye will hold this compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rison
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:4124:100"/>
betwixt the Iewish and Christian Church to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and fantasticke, because the first was Typicall, and is expired, I answer, There was in the Mosaicall Law three parts, the typicall, the morall, and the politicall: the daily sacrifice and these ceremoniall things which were figuratiue of Christs passion, they are finished and haue no imitation in Christs Church, but for the morall it doth remaine: the same Law lieth ouer vs which did astrict them, albeit we haue easier meanes to performe it by faith in <hi>Iesus Christ.</hi> And for the politicall it doth also remaine as <hi>S. Paul</hi> saith: <hi>Know you not that those who</hi> 
               <note place="margin">1. Cor. 9.</note> 
               <hi>minister at the altar, doe liue by the Altar &amp;c?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for the concordance of these two Churches in matter of Policie, I bring first the testimony of <hi>S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> who expounding these words of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy, Seniorem ne increpaueris,</hi> doe not reproach an Elder, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong other things he saith also thus: <hi>Vnde Synagogaprius, &amp; postea Ecclesia Seniores habuit sine quorum consilio nihil agebatur,</hi> first the Iewish Synagogue, &amp; then the Church of Christ had their <hi>Elders</hi> without whose Councell no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was done. Next I bring the testimony of <hi>Iohn Caluine,</hi> who vpon the harmony of the Euangelists hath written thus, <hi>Quant au nombre de 70. il me semble auoir,</hi> &amp;c. Touching the number of the 70. Disciples, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peares to me (saith he) that our Sauiour hath followed the same order, whereunto the Iewes of old were subiect and accustomed: So many Apostles were chosen who should be as Patriarkes to assemble the members of the reall body of the Church, &amp; for the like respect of imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the 70. Disciples were elected, for we know saith he that <hi>Moses</hi> being vnable to beare the charge, tooke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him seuentie to gouerne the people. For of him who would obiect against the similitude of these Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for policie, that the 70. of Israel were no spirituall Rulers, and therefore could not be resembled by the 70. Disciples, I would aske you how then did the holy spirit come vpon them, that they prophesied in the presence
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:4124:101"/>
of the people, and how was the spirit of <hi>Moses</hi> parted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. Thirdly I giue the Testimony of Doctour <hi>Beza</hi> who hath deriued his reformed discipline whereby the Elders be adioyned to the Pastours, from the Iewish example. But that which makes this poynt of the simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude in policie of these two Churches to be most cleere and out of doubt, is the opinion of <hi>S.

Which obiection is so friuolous that <hi>Caluine</hi> himselfe (alleaged by them to bee a fautor of their Presbyterian rule) doth answer vnto it, saying, there is not the like reason betwixt a peculiar people as the Iewish Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, <note place="margin">I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:4124:103"/>
was embraced in the very first succession of the Apostles. For Ignatius who was Bishop of Antioch in the Apostles time, after that Euodius had been there before him, hee did vsually distinguish these three degrees of the Clergie, as the Church hath euer done since by these three names: Bishop, Presbyter and Deacon, the difference of which degrees and the superioritie of Bishops, is wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessed by the same Ignatius, writing to the Smyrnenses, Let no man doe any thing appertayning to the Church, saith he, yea let not the administration of the Eucharist be lawfull, but by the Bishop, or by him who hath his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie from the Bishop.</p>
            <p>Next touching the restimonies of Antiquitie vpon the vse and benefit of Episcopall Regiment, all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers doe in one voyce applaude that which <hi>Cyprian</hi> the most modest of Bishops hath written in that point, affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming that all heresies and schismes haue euer flowed from discontented humours of those who contemne the authoritie of Bishops, which is placed to coerce, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them. <hi>Unde schismata &amp; hereses aborta sunt nisi dum Episcopus contemnitur, &amp; homo dignatione Dei honoratus ab indignis hominibus iudicatur,</hi> from whence are heresies, <note place="margin">Cyprian: lib. 4. epist. 9.</note> saith he, but because vnworthy men doe censure and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spise him whom God hath honoured with preferment. <hi>Basilius</hi> saith, that the vnitie of the Church doth depend from the vnitie of the Bishop, and that the erection of a second Bishop within one Diocesse (vnlesse it be to help and assist him by his own consent) hath euer been estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the breeding of schisme: but of all the Auncients Saint <hi>Ierom</hi> doth best cleare the truth of this point, euen hee who is pretended to be <hi>flagellum Episcop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> the scourge of Bishops, as you shall see. It is true indeed that <hi>Ierom</hi> writing vpon the first of the Epistle to Titus, hath once called the Episcopall authoritie rather a cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stome then an Apostolicall Tradition, saying thus: Before that by instinct of the Deuill there were factions in the Church, and that it was said among the people,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:4124:104"/>
I am of Paul, I am of Apollo, and I of Cephas, the Church was gouerned by the common consent of the Presbyters, but after through all the world it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed, that one of the Presbyters should be placed aboue the rest, to whom should apperteine the whole Ecclesia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall care and extirpation of schisme. Thus far <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>m.</hi> Out of which words the Presbyterians doe extort this consequence, that the primitiue Church was gouerned by presbyteriall policie without Bishops: to this the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer is, first, if it were granted to come in by a consueted and not by a primitiue tradition. Yet the consequence is voyde against Bishops, vnlesse we will say that Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Deacons were not neither an Apostolicall ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, because in the beginning the Apostles did go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne the Church without both these, by consent of the people, as it is manifest by the Epistle to Titus, as Creta, Corynth, Ephesus and Philippi before they had Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus or Presbyter, whom when they did receiue, the Church did yet remaine vnder the rule of the Apostles. Secondly, it is answered where hee speakes of the choo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of one Presbyter aboue the rest, for taking order with schismes, that schismes were begun in the Apostles ownetime, so that this same election hath been also then begun: or otherwise, that the Apostles haue not been so wise as their Successors, which were absurd to hold. Thirdly, it is answered, that reason of <hi>Ierom</hi> taketh away Deacons as well as Bishops, because the murmurations of the Greekes against the Hebrewes, moued that insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution <note place="margin">Acts 6.</note> as wee know, which was not in the beginning. Fourthly, it is answered, this opinion of <hi>Ierom</hi> is singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and perhaps of temerarious and discontented hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, hee being but a Presbyter. For while he speaketh of a noueltie in the Church accepted through all the world, he should haue put downe the time by particular circumstances, otherwise hee leaueth his opinion weake and obnoxious.

the Iewish Church, in which speeches first and last of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom, we doe not onely obserue the great benefit redoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Church by Bishops, and the end why they were created, for vnitie and auoyding of schismes, but we doe in like manner marke the antiquitie of that policie, from S.

            <p>After that some of the inferiour Clerkes, who did as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist the informall election of Nouatian in the place of Cornelius, were againe reduced vnto the Catholike Church, their penitence was declared in these words, <hi>We are not ignorant, that there is one God, one Christ, one holy Ghost, one Bishop into one Church.</hi> whereby wee see that vnitie was the end of Episcopall institution. When Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine at the instance of the deuout Matrons of Rome, licenced Liberius to returne, but withall appointed that Church gouernment to bee common betwixt him and Felix.

            <p>Now because I intend not to bee tedious in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, therefore you are to marke how of all these an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, I haue chosen out three, whose testimonies and opinions in the question of Bishops, is to bee esteemed most sincere for the reason following. Of all the Bishops of Antiquity, <hi>Cyprian</hi> was the most fauourable, and most affected to his Presbyters, and in his carriage more like to a Compresbyter then a Prelate. Of all the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoppes of Antiquity whose writings are extant in the Church, <hi>Ignatius</hi> is most ancient, and hath drawne his knowledge out of the pure fountaines of Apostolicall wisedome, and not from the riuers as his fellowes haue done: Of all the Doctours of Antiquity, <hi>Ierome</hi> is most sought to, by the Presbyterians: The Councell of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dica, cap.</hi> 10. 13. hath decreed that if a rich man by meanes of Court come to bee a Bishop, hee shall first performe the office of a Reader, Deacon and Presbyter, that by degrees hee may ascend to the height of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke. <hi>Nazianzene</hi> giueth testimony of <hi>Athanasius</hi> and <hi>Basil,</hi> that they ascended into Episcopall dignity by the spiritual Law, through all the degrees of Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call offices. The Councell of <hi>Antioch,</hi> that whatsoeuer things appertaine vnto the Church are to bee gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the authority of the Bishop by whom say they people are instructed. The Councell of <hi>Calcedon</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed that none should build a Cloyster, or Monastery, without the consent of the Bishop of the City, and that all Monasticall persons should bee subiect to the Bishop. And if we should search all the Doctours, Fathers, and Councells, wee should finde that Episcopall policy ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a cleere consent of all Catholike anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie to applaud it. So farre that for the first thousand
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:4124:107"/>
yeeres of the Church no man hath beene knowen to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie or decline it, but onely <hi>Aereus</hi> who was therefore compted an Heretike by <hi>Augustine</hi> in his Catalogue of heresies, and by <hi>Epiphanius</hi> also, which hath not beene rashly, nor with repentance affirmed by <hi>Augustine,</hi> as some hold, for it was written after his retractation, and after his writing of 230 Bookes besides his Epistles and Homilies, He saith in his preface, that it is hard to giue an accurate definition of an Hereticke, he reckoneth vp 53. heresies which after Christs ascenscion were contrary to his doctrine, giuing the last place to that of <hi>Aereus:</hi> And concluding in the end of all, <hi>Omnis it aque Christia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus Catholicus ista non debet credere.</hi> Euery Christian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike <note place="margin">Concilium Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cens. cap. 8.</note> ought not therfore to beleeue them. The Cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cell of Nice hauing decreed that the Catharists or Nauatians or a sort of sublimitated Puritans of these daies returned to penitence vnto the Church, those who had brooked any dignity of before, should be repossessed of any office whatsoeuer in the Church, except it were to displace a Bishop, which should not bee lawfull to him who hath beene a Nouatian Bishop. But hee should content him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe to be a Priest, vnlesse the Bishop would receiue him to be a Coadiutor, or communicate to him the honour of the name, or if hee like him not to finde him a Choro-Episcopat or Presbyterat, To the end as <hi>Ruffinus</hi> sayes, <hi>Ne in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:4124:108"/>
fieri noluit.</hi> So did this holy man reuerence that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Nice in fauours of orthodoxall Bishops, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther shall we find through all ancient Counsels or Fathers one, who hath not done the like, reposing still the glory of the Church vpon the authority of Bishops, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that which <hi>Dauid</hi> did foresee in his Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall spirit, saying in his 45. Psalme, Insteed of Fathers children shall be borne vnto thee, whom thou shalt make Princes in all the earth, which word <hi>Augustine</hi> doth inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prete insteed of Apostolos, who were thy fathers. O Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church sonnes who are Bishops are created vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee, therefore thinke not thy selfe forsaken because thou seest not <hi>Peter</hi> nor <hi>Paul</hi> who begat thee: <hi>Agnoscant quiprecisi sunt, veniant ad vnitatem,</hi> Let them (saith hee) who are Opiniators and Schismatiks acknowledge those sonnes who be borne to the Church to be her Princes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer all the Earth.</p>

In regard of which Catholike and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant testimonies from time to time, what shall wee say? shall we not for once thinke it impossible, that the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of the Apostles, all the holy Fathers, so many Martyrs and Saints would haue abolished that gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whatsoeuer which Christ and his Apostles left vnto the Church, for the next shall we not hold it impossible to fall out, that any policie which was not receiued from the Apostles could be at one time embraced of the whole Christian world, and approoued of all generall counsels in the Primitiue Church. For the last shall we not thinke it a scorne beyond all scornes, that all those antiquities and Apostolicall traditions witnessed by Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall men, generall counsels, Fathers, Doctours, Catholike consent without interruption, must bee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned for follies, schismes, corruptions, by some pure and <hi>Heteroclite</hi> braines, who haue start vp more then 1500. yeeres after, to impugne the credit of the Church Gouernment, qualified by so many diuine men whose faith was tried in the fire of affliction, and who sealed their profession with glorious Martyrdome.

If any man will say it was the merit of the men, &amp; no ordination of the Church, I answer if it was so, it is all one to beare authoritie, whether coloura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly or openly, onely heere is the difference, that lawfull authoritie is better then that which men doe arrogate without warrant, and it is better to endure a lawfull Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop then an vsurping Brother; but to neither of these two doe I ascribe any disorder, they were wise, learned, and diuine men, who did comport with the policie of the

I say no more, but God of his mercy grant that ourmost vpright Christian Ministers, may follow their example, in true pastorall vigilance and sincerity, out of those mirrours, let vs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerence this beginnings which we see of our reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that by our zeale and loue, to peace and vnitie, God may be moued to ouerthrow that beast of Rome, and to plant againe his holy spirit in it, to dissolue the Papall tyranny, &amp; to reduce it to the ancient &amp; regular limits of Patriarchall degree; If this Counsell be contrary to your Theologie, then learne it from nature, That Princes and Prelates are the Superiour Orbes that moue you, and therefore that no motion must be within the peculiar Spheare of your Pastorall discharge, to make you diso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey their motions, and if you cannot neither doe this out of a good instinct of nature, like the celestiall Planets, whose proper mouements doe neuer hinder them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey and follow their <hi>Primum Mobile,</hi> Then for the last, make it a good and necessarie policie to imitate that Goose, who knowing her owne imperfection, prouides for those euils which might fall vpon her in perilous places, through too much noise, and so to saue her selfe from the Eagles which frequent the top of mount Tau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus, as she flieth along it, she keepeth a lowe course, and carrieth a stone in her beake to restraine her ordinarie cry: Princes and Prelates <hi>tanquam aues solares</hi> are like the celestiall Eagles which goe neerest to the sunne, they receiue the immediate inspiration and deputation of God to rule the inferiour world, they are placed in the

proper application in the setting foorth and beautifying (within due and decent limits) the seruice of Almighty God. The first doth worke vpon us as men; the second as wee are ciuill men, the third as wee are Christian men.</p>
            <p>Of Musique I will speake in the first place, presuming that not onely when it is heard acting its owne part to the eare in harmonicall sounds; but euen when the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and commendation thereof are made the subiect matter of prosaicall discourse, presenting the vigour and force thereof though but to the eye of the Reader, yet it will haue its wonted operation in sweetly charming the affection of those, who haue drunke in some preiudice against it; and distaste of the vse of it in <hi>sacris,</hi> so that my Readers mind being set <hi>in symbalis bene sonantibus,</hi> in good tune; by the impressions of Musique (though by mee an vnskilfull artsman rudely fingered) they will I hope the more calmely and temperately accept the other follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing treatise of uestiments, especially while it is so briefe.

luxurious humour was presently allayed.</p>
            <p>Whereby, as also by euery mans daily experience it is euident what force there is in Musique for inciting, composing and moderating the passions of the minde. But here euen out of this example may be obiected the abuse and corruption of manners by some kinde of light harmonie applyed to lighter Ditties; whereto I answer, that this it selfe is no small commendation vnto the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer and more diuine sort of harmonie, that the Deuill (whose desire and vse is alwaies to peruert the best crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and gifts of God) hath sought thus <hi>infamare rem optimam,</hi> to discredit so excellent a gift as Musique is. As <hi>Bucer</hi> saith in <hi>Psalm: Haud leuiter detestandum rem tam diuinam &amp; religioni praecipuè natam abusu ad vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptates sic viluisse ac redditam infamem.</hi> The convenient and necessarie vse of wholesome herbes and commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous mineralls is not to be abandoned, but rather with more discretion and diligence to be searched into, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause some others are dangerous and poysonous. The Deuill hath not onely his furnished Quyre for Idolatry (as in the worship of the golden Image) and his Min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strelsie for wantonnes, but euen his set invocations and Sacraments: yet wee doe not therefore robbe God of his due in these kindes, because the Deuills apish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse hath endeauoured by imitation to derogate from his most decent and formall worship. But this by the way.</p>
            <p>To returne to that kinde of Musique, whereof onely wee vnderstand; whatsoeuer wee haue or shall in this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course bring for the aduancing the seruice of God, namely, the graue, constant, and as it is of the Ancients called, <hi>Spondaike</hi> veyne of harmonie; that surely hath a naturall fitnesse to allay our incomposed and disorde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red affections, to imprint in our soules if not the chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter of vertue, yet the next aptitude thereto, if not to sow the fruitfull seeds of piety, yet to make <hi>animum sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actum,</hi> that is, to prepare and eare vp the furrowes of our
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:4124:118"/>
hearts, and to leaue our passions fertile and ready for receipt of the best impressions.</p>
            <p>And when I pray you can the vse of such externall helps be more seasonable, then when wee must most of all sequester our thoughts from the drosse of carnall and worldly encombrances, when wee are to sublimate our soules and to make them ascend vnto the throne of grace? Where can the symphony of decent Musique more fitly sound, then where there is already a sympho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic and vnion of desires, yea of soules in a deuout con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of Christians? Where shall the souldiers ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to heare the language of their warfare, the trumpet and drum to giue the alarme, to whet their fortitude and incite them to fight fiercely and constantly, but there, where they are in their troupes and bands combined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, in battell aray? What indeed are the prayers of a full Christian Congregation, but an earnest striuing with God, and euen wrastling with him for a blessing as <hi>Iacob</hi> did, or withholding him from iudgements, as <hi>Moses</hi> did, nay a kinde of besieging and surprising the fortresse of heauen it selfe by violence? Most true it is that the fountaine and root of all such powerfull inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessions and invocations is the inward zeale of the heart, which the eye of the Almightie hath speciall regard vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to (so that without it the approaching neere to God with our lips is not only fruitlesse but abhominable) yet as true is it that this our inward zeale and deuotion is the more enflamed and increased euen towards God, and il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrated and imparted mutually by one to another by the outward additaments and helps of gesture, tunes, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, melodious harmonie of voice and of instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, by the passionate inflexions whereof the soule is sweetly tempered, and lead with ease and delight to those apprehensions which otherwise it could not without dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultie and laborious intention be framed vnto. By the loftinesse whereof the soule getteth winges to mount the swifter and soare the higher. Not that the shrilnesse
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:4124:118"/>
or sweetnesse of these sounds doth really pierce the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uens, or that God is delighted with the melodious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions of sounds, but as vocall prayer is commended and commanded by him who before hand knoweth the vnuttered petitions and groanes of our hearts, not onely in publique invocation for a meane of coniunction, but euen in priuate deuotions and eiaculations of the soule for the better enflaming of our hearts with feruencie by the concurring of bodily expressions; so also is this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall and vocall adoration commodiously seconded and strongly redoubled by those instigations and trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations which are suggested by Musique. In which, furnishing the seruice of God, it is not necessarie that eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie note or point in the smallest parts and fractions bee significant in it selfe, (that in Instruments especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impossible) but it is sufficient that they accompanie and concord with the dittie and words of invocation, cloathing them as it were with habit and shapes fit for the particular matter and phrase of the hymne; sometime putting on a large habit and deepe colour of grauitie and slownesse, otherwhile with quicknesse and agilitie pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing more lightly and hastily, sometime aduancing with lowdnesse, otherwhile depressing with lownesse, still ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a liuely and emphaticall impression of harmonie befitting the character of the subiect matter.</p>
            <p>Most powerfully doth the heauenly vigor of stately and maiestike Musique both of voice and instruments, set forth it selfe as vpon a fit stage of action, when the vniuersall Church presenteth to God hir reuerent and awfull adoration of his heauenly Maiestie, when the tongues of Angells and of all other creatures are repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented by the tongues of men, when whatsoeuer gift is in Art, is in a modell shadowed in the artificiall Musique, all proclayming the vnspeakable power and wisdome of the Creator, the infinite mercie of the Redeemer, the endles glory of him by whom and for whom are all things. Of this streyne and stile are those diuine
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:4124:119"/>
hymnes scattered among the Psalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to the Church in all ages by the spirit of God: In speciall the Psalmes 33. 104. 135. 136 147. 148. 150. And next to those sacred portions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that excellent hymne <hi>Te Deum</hi> penned by <hi>S. Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brose,</hi> and vsed in the daily Liturgie of the Westerne Church. These and such like sacred Ditties of glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, and yeelding to his throne the tributarie duty and thankes of all the creatures, when they are duely consorted with voyce and sober graue Instruments, they are like <hi>bona merx in bono lumine collocata,</hi> pretious wares or faire pictures set in a lightsome place. nay they doe so naturally symbolize with Instruments, as if they had not been so much composed for Musique, as Musique invented for them.</p>
            <p>Another eminent transportation befitting solemne Musique is <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the loftie streyne of tryumph of Gods Church, which being armed and embellished with harmonie, doth not onely fortifie the hearts of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God in their reioycing, but also seemeth to giue a more powerfull defiance to the enemies of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, both visible oppressors, and invisible op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers, wicked men, and spirituall wickednesses. Of this sort are the tryumphant songs of <hi>Moses,</hi> Exod: 15. of <hi>Deborah,</hi> Iud. 5. of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Psal: 114. which, with some others of that kinde being poetically penned, seeme in their measure of words and periods, to awake the Harpe and Lute, and to call for the ornaments of Musique to be put vpon them, as if bare reading or pronouncing were too cold and thin a cloathing for them.</p>
            <p>Other passions of desire, of spirituall loue, of hope, of awe, of sorrow, of charitie, of deuote humilitie, &amp; whatso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer else is the exercise of a Christian, may receiue from hence their enlargment &amp; extention. He that in remorse of his own vilenesse would with the Publican beat his breast, and strike sadly and softly at the gate of mercy, for the easier melting of his soule let his eare be possessed
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:4124:119"/>
with a dolesome, flat, and spondaike streine of Musique. Here of <hi>S. Augustine</hi> is a witnesse by his owne experience, from whose eyes teares were drawne by the publique <note place="margin">Conf</note> Musique of the Church at Milan. And surely that heart must needs be very tough and obdurate, in which graue and well composed Musique displaying it selfe in the house of God doth neuer beget some good disposition to remorse or deuotion. <hi>Vere qui norunt quid sit toto corde, tota anima, totis<expan>

            <p>So we see that Musique hath its part in the Church of God for edification, though not of the vnderstanding directly, because it doth not infuse knowledge, yet of the affections, which are the proper obiect of Musique, as it is operatiue. The affections are the Sea on which this heauenly light worketh by perpendicular aspect. Their floats, their ebbs, are caused and guided by this planet, their stormes and waues are allayed by this sweet influence. As by sleepe <hi>concentratur calor, colligun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur spiritus,</hi> the spirits vitall and animall are called in, the naturall heat is drawne to the center, so by the rauishing slumber in which sweet harmonie enwrappeth the soule, the senses are suspended, and all exorbitant passions rety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. And yet indirectly and by accident it may be said to worke vpon the vnderstanding also, by suggesting and proposing fit streynes and harmonies, which being but dead in themselues, yet doe invite the minde to giue a kinde of forme and soule to them, and to apply sutable contemplations and eiaculations of the soule formerly instructed, and now abstracted, and made in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree extaticall: In which regard there is some libertie giuen vnto organicall Musique, not only to accompanie the voyce, but also sometime for short spaces to hold on when the vocall maketh a pause, that thereby it may be left a little to its owne proper and solitarie operation, as
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:4124:120"/>
also that some relaxation and intermission may be affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded both to those that are imployed in reading and sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and to the continuall intention of the Auditors at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, alwayes prouided, that in these interims or inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scenes, neither to much time be taken vp, nor in any Church musicke, to much curiositie or ostentation of art be vsed, as the learned and iuditious Master <hi>Hooker</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monisheth, much lesse any light and wanton tunes or straines: of which abomination in the Popish Quyres Master <hi>Bucer</hi> complaineth, that their Organists did <hi>Spurcissimarum cautionum melos Organis modulari, &amp; sub</hi>

               <hi>nomine Christi crucifixi nil aliud quam Veneri sacrificari,</hi> play filthy ribauld tunes vpon the Organs, and vnder the shew of deuotion to Christ crucified, offer sacrifice euen to Venus. But such prophane abuses suggested by the deuill cannot preiudice the Godly vse of graue musicke, as before I haue noted.</p>
            <p>Now to proceed in my intended discourse: In the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scriptures we finde very frequent and diuerse motiues for the approbation and recommendation of the vse of Musicke in the seruice of God; In prosecution whereof, my intent is not to take vp whatsoeuer may be to that purpose auouched or collected out of the booke of God, but only to touch in briefe the principall heads, whereto, any one that will imploy more particular paines in this search, may referre other proofes which I shall passe by. The distinct consideration of these proofes, may bee raunged according to these seuerall times, into which by the ordinance of the Creator, all time, and euen all suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding eternitie is diuided: namely the ages before the law, vnder the law, the current season of the Gospel; and the boundlesse eternity of future glory.</p>
            <p>And first vnder the law of nature, before the Mosai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call was instituted, we may obserue, that <hi>Gen.</hi> 4. 21. there is a speciall marke of recommendation to all posteritie set vpon <hi>Tubal, That he was the father of those that play vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Organs and Harpes:</hi> that is, that such musicall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments were both intended by <hi>Tubal,</hi> and afterward
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:4124:120"/>
frequented and vsed by his instruction or immitation. From whence I thus collect and argue: whatsoeuer hath in it a naturall fitnesse for the glorifying of God, was in that age, if not by the inuenter intended, yet by the after practises imployed to the seruice of God: But musicke, whether vocall or instrumentall, hath in it a disposition to the aduancing of the glory of God, not in a generall remote and indirect sort (as all both artificiall inuenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and naturall creatures haue in their particular ends, a secret reference to the last and highest end the glorify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of him, who is all in all) but properly and directly in guiding, conforming, altering and seasoning the best of our affections, our zeale to Gods honour, and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Maiesty, as hath beene before declared; Therefore it appearing that in that young growth of the world, such instruments were found out &amp; published, it is more then probable, that they were by the best men of that age, &amp; faithfullest imployed to the best vse, euen the helpe and beautifying of the inuocation of the name of God. What, though it doe not appeare, what was then the forme of outward inuocation and worship of God, beside sacrificing? What though the Church was not then perhaps growen into a politicall state? As surely as men had then, both by nature, instinct of the Godhead, and by instruction from <hi>Adam,</hi> a knowledge of the true God, and of his due worship, so certainely they did vse outward inuocation with the voyce, as well as with the heart: and why not by singing as well as saying: and why not with instrumentall musicke, as well as vocall? Why then not ordeined and ordered by the oeconomical regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Patriarkes, in whom the Priestly power was vnited with the Regall, as well as afterward published by more distinct constitution, when the Priesthood was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered from the kingly office. He that is incredulous herein, let him but trauaile a little further with the Church of God, and follow the footsteps of Israel ouer the red sea, he shall presently heare sounding in his eares
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:4124:121"/>
that most Patheticall and Poeticall song of triumph, penned and chaunted by the man of God, and Prince and Prophet of Israel the great <hi>Moses,</hi> and not so onely, but also ecchoed with solemne chorall responses, by the sister of the high Priest, and to shew that all voycing mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke, though hauing so noble a precentor, and being ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated by so full a Quire of all the people of Israel (verse 1.) yet is not sufficient to display the zeale and ioy of the Church of God, there commeth in besides, as in <hi>Medio Chori,</hi> the noyse of Tymbrels in the hands of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riam,</hi> and of all the women that came out after her (verse 20.) not to yeeld any new instruction to their vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstandings, though she were a Prophetesse, but (which is the true vse of such musicke) first to giue a greater downeweight to their affections, and to make their spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ioy ouerflow the bankes of ordinary apprehensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to transport them into an higher degree of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly rauishment, by those artificiall sounds added to the naturall, and secondly to infixe deeper in their minds and memories those diuine straines, by recording and repeating the same point in the same verses, a thing in Church musicke, not to be abandoned, if tempered with grauity, as here we may expresly gather.</p>
            <p>For when <hi>Moses</hi> and the people had begun their song in this manner. <hi>I will sing vnto the Lord: for hee hath tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed gloriously, &amp;c. Miriam</hi> with her troupe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments and voyces, answered the men, <hi>Sing yee vnto the Lord: for hee hath triumphed gloriously, &amp;c. (vers.</hi> 21.)</p>
            <p>This because it did precede the deliuery of the cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniall law by <hi>Moses,</hi> I thinke I may safely referre ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the law of nature, or to the inueterate practise of the most antient Church of God, euen from the first Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarkes and Fathers of mankind. In time of the Law, the very enditer himselfe <hi>Moses,</hi> did by the immediate command of God, when he was to die, leaue as his last Testament of monition or <hi>cygnea cantio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> a formall song, which as God put into his mouth, so he into the mouths
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:4124:121"/>
of the children of Israel, <hi>Exod.</hi> 31. 19. to be a perpetuall witnesse to and against them: which beginneth with a most rhetoricall and Poeticall exclamation of adiuring the heauens and earth to bee witnesses. This pithy ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stract of the admonitions and doctrines of <hi>Moses,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning Gods benefits towardes his Church, the vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brayding of their ingratitude, Gods threats against them, and mysterious predictions of the vocation of the Gentiles, &amp;c. The spirit of GOD did chuse to set downe to his Church, rather in forme of Song then of Sermon, thereby insinuating that it would be with more facility receiued and with deeper impression retained, which is implied by <hi>Moses</hi> himselfe in the following words of the beginning of that song, <hi>ver. 2. My doctrine shall drop as the raine and my speech shall distill as the deaw.</hi> As if hee had said this last doctrine of mine which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to Gods people by way of song, shall indeed by the diuine matter thereof instruct their vnderstandings: but shall by the manner of musicall inditement and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording therof, pierce with the greater sweetnesse and facility, and by a secret vnseene influence, feed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fresh your soules, as the hearbs and plants are cherished by the deaw and fedde by the soft showers. And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward when the Temple was to succeed the Tabernacle, <hi>Dauid</hi> did before hand prouide Leuites and singers: his preparations of that kinde were: first, when <hi>the Arke had rest (1. Chron. 6. 31.) 1. Chron.</hi> 15. And shortly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Temple was to be builded by <hi>Salomon, 1. Chron.</hi> 25. At both <hi>Dauid</hi> appointed Leuites and singers with <hi>instruments of musicke, &amp;c.</hi> And added thereto the dit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they were to sing, being a set forme of inuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and thanksgiuing. 1. <hi>Chron. 16. 8. Prayse yee the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> which also is repeated among the Psalmes, <hi>Psal.</hi> 105. Moreouer, in a manner the whole Booke of Psalmes were by the same Prophet, penned in Meeter to be sung (as they are since in all ages and places) in the Church of God. Amongst which some <hi>Psalm.</hi> 33. and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:4124:122"/>
150. make especiall reference vnto the instrumentall musicke.</p>
            <p>If heereto it be replied that all this furniture of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sicke was proper to the Temple, and meerely typicall, and part of the pedagogy of the old Testament, I may answere that in regard of the number and distinct offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and certaine kindes of instruments, those constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Dauid</hi> might well bee ceremoniall: but the vse of instrumentall musicke in generall in the publike praising of God, was and is morall or naturall; not indeed of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute necessity, as if there were no lawfull seruice in the Church without it, but of conuenience and expediency for the naturall fitnesse, and decent fruitfulnesse which they may haue. Neither can it be denied but that where the same cause of constitution yet remaineth, the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise may be well retained, at least as times and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances shall require or permit. Now those that are most seuerely affected against the Church musicke among Christians, vse this as a chiefe reason why it was establi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed in that Church, because it was a fit <hi>Schoolemaster for that people.</hi> And are there not and alwayes will bee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Christians, some that neede to be fed with milke, as well as others with strong meate? Did not Saint <hi>Basil</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Basil in Psa. 48.</note> obserue this, and in that regard commend the proui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the spirit of God, who by the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> had prouided for his Church perpetually, that heauenly mysteries, might be mingled with sweet melody. <hi>That two sort of learners might thus bee the better prouided for, those that are either young in yeeres, or greene in growth of vertue might while they thinke to delight themselues with the melody, receiue some good impression of instruction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if this cause seeme vnsufficient, or Saint <hi>Basils</hi> authority not strong enough, wee may out of the text it selfe, where this musicall furniture for the Temple is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted. 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 16. deriue a more constant reason, which must needes hold in both Testaments. <hi>Leuites were appointed to sing with instruments, &amp;c. that they might
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:4124:122"/>
make a sound and lift vp their voyce with ioy:</hi> whence I thinke I may thus inferre. The end and reason of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution of such musicke by <hi>Dauid</hi> is not (for ought I can finde) said to be for any prefiguration of action to be fulfilled by the Messias, or for any cause or conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent proper to the people and Church of the Iewes, which with the sacrifices and other ceremonies were to expire, but the reason there added is from a naturall or rather spirituall affection common to all Churches whether vnder the Law of <hi>Moses</hi> or vnder the Gospell of grace, especially in flourishing times, namely a cleare and feruent confession and profession of the mercies and graces of our God with thanksgiuing and exultati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which as it is in the congregation to be solemnly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed with the <hi>voyce,</hi> and that <hi>lifted vp</hi> viz. with sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, so that it may be aduanced to the highest streyne of <hi>ioy,</hi> it must, or at least with conueniency may, haue the help of instrumentall musique <hi>which may make a sound and lift vp their voice with ioy.</hi> So if in the Christian Church, where the vaile is withdrawne, and the myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and mercies of God the Father in his beloued ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare more cleerely and gloriously, there bee no lesse cause of holy ioy (nay vnspeakable and glorious, 1. <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 8.) why should not this our ioy breake forth into the like manifestation, and that the best manifesting and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunsing thereof, is by musicke, and that euen instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall, the spirit of God beareth record, as I haue noted. And verily if the imployment of instruments in the Iudaicall Temple maketh them meerely ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall, and debarreth the Christian Church of all such vse of the like in that kinde; why doth not the same reason banish also all vse of singing in our Churches, because <hi>Dauid</hi> instituted singers for the Temple? for as yet I could neuer heere any direct and sufficient proofe, why the one should haue a morall and perpetuall vse, and the other onely a ceremoniall signification.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, as for the time of grace if sacred musicke
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:4124:123"/>
were onely a cloud and typicall shadow, it should then haue vanished when the body came and the most glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous morning starre appeared. But wee finde that euen this bright starre, when it first began to appeare in the earthly Horizon, chose for the blasing forth the beames of his maiesty aboueall creatures, or meanes in heauen or earth, a troup of inuisible, yet audible Choristers: who descending from the Temple of the celcstiall Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem, <note place="margin">Luk. 2. 13.</note> praised God and cheered vp man with a short Christmasse Caroll, but of a most sweet and mysterious ditty; which all Christians delight to heere still sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their eares and hearts, nay the very Angells them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues desire to behold &amp; vnderstand. The same our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uior, as he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ming into the world would be saluted with musicke, so euen with that mouth whence dropped the like hony, the words of grace and life: he vouchsafed to honour that exercise in the end of his last supper, hee and his Apostles went to Mount Oliue singing an Hymne.</p>
            <p>Neither after this our bridegroome was taken away <note place="margin">Mat. 26. 30.</note> did the children of the bridechamber, let fall their parts in spirituall songs, but both practised and exhorted to the continuance of this enkindling of zeale and piety. <hi>Ephes. 5. 19. Colos.</hi> 3. 16. An expresse iniunction for <hi>Psalmes, Hymnes, and spirituall Songs, and making melody.</hi> Which vse to haue continued in the primitiue Church, not onely <hi>Tertullian</hi> and other ancient Christians, but euen the Ethnicke, <hi>Plinny</hi> in his Epistle to <hi>Traiane</hi> the Emperour doth testifie, <hi>Christo cuidam Deo hymnos canen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes antelucanes:</hi> But heere may bee, and indeed is obiec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that hymnes and songs, vsed by our Sauiour, or his Apostles, or continued in the primitiue Church, were onely vocal and without all artificiall instrument. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that I may shape answere, I doubt not (euen granting that their melody was onely singing) thence to inferre <hi>à pari,</hi> a firm consequence for the addition of the other kind of musick, &amp; to auouch without imputation of a

Then presently followes the same re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblance with the terms inuerted to the naturall order, where hee plainely sheweth that art hath heerein imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted nature in Citeraes and such like instruments wherin <hi>the teeth are represented by the strings, the lips by the frets, the tongue by the quill, the vnderstanding by the hand, which mooueth and striketh, or stoppeth high and low, lowd and soft, slow and quicke in diuerse formes.</hi> The like comparison is also vsed by <hi>Gregory Nyssen</hi> in his learned Treatise <hi>De opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficio hominis,</hi> where he resembleth the vse and parts of the flute or fife to the instruments of speech in man.

so may I terme an organ a singing man made with the hand, or rather a liuelesse though not breathlesse guide of many voicesand parts.</p>
            <p>But heere it will bee replyd, that all artificiall instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made by man, come farre short of this one made by God himselfe, that none of those how elegant soeuer and cunningly handled, can possibly make a sound pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly articulate, much lesse significant; and therefore that they are to bee excluded out of the seruice of God, whereto the vocall musique may bee admitted because significatiue and vnderstandable. To this may answer be made, first by acknowledging with <hi>Theodoret that man being the image of God, in imitating his Creatonr can produce no higher workes then such as are but shadowes of the workes of God. That nature is the modell after which art wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth, and that art is but the image or resemblance of nature.</hi> And therefore that all the most curious instruments in the world are not comparable with an humane voyce for suauity and liuely expressions, neither is instrumentall musique to be opposed vnto, or compared with vocall, but added as an helper, a wife, or second, or if you will an hand-mayd thereunto. In which respect I doe not hold it to bee <hi>eiusdem gradus</hi> though in generall <hi>eiusdem rationis:</hi> as belonging to the same army, but to be ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in an inferiour squadron: a guest of the sacred feast, but at a lower table. Secondly, as for want of significa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I maintaine it that the sound and harmony of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments though it be not articulate, yet it is significant; in its owne kinde I meane and proper element, by gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle steps and sweete inflexions working vpon the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and expressely nay powerfully speaking to them, euen perswading, instructing, nay commanding them, and imprinting in them the characters of vertue and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion, and containing the seedes of good motions in the inward seat of the minde by the outer part of the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and passions. Thirdly in vocall musique I demand what it is that shall make that lawfull and conuenient for
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:4124:124"/>
Gods seruice? Is it the signification of the words? or the melodie of the tune and symphonie? If the first, then singing is not recommended as it is singing, but rather as saying: and then it were better such psalmes or hymnes were barely pronounced or read: for so their sence and signification is best vnderstood. If the second, then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strumentall musique must likewise be admitted, wherein the same sounds for tune and concord of parts are by the same rules of art practised and expressed. But it may be oueradded that the musique of the voice is passable, as hauing both these together and performing them with one breath. Most true; and therein is the chiefe excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of that guift of God, that in one and the same sound it edifieth both the vnderstanding and the affections. Yet the other which cannot act but one of his properties is not therefore to bee condemned or contemned. In physique some ingredients worke <hi>attrahende</hi> by their searching and vigorous quality of attraction, others only <hi>adiuuando</hi> by diffusing the stronger simples, and so hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the operation of them: and without these the other would be lesse actiue and profitable. Euen so in sacred musique the chiefe vigour of our praiers and adoration commeth from the ditty which worketh immediately vpon our vnderstanding, but that is much helped and quickened by adding thereto a proportionable temper of artificiall harmony, which shall make it penetrate the deeper into our affections.</p>

            <p>I will not heere (lest I should lose my selfe) intrude into the search of hidden secrets treasured vp in heauen, how and in what sense Angels and blessed Saints in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen are to be vnderstood to sing before the throne of the Almightie: whether this be in the Scripture described in a sensible forme onely for our capacity, but to bee inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted in a spirituall and allegoricall allusion; surely if the substance of Angels and soules of men be not meere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incorporall, it is not absurd to maintaine that they may immediately <hi>ex iunatis principijs &amp; similitudine sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantiae</hi> in the most pure body or space of the heauen of heauens the seat of the blessed, both raise such reall and corporeall voyces, &amp; also be affected with the sweet har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie and proportions of such sounds.

humanitie, <hi>oculis meis videbo Redemptore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> meu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> saith <hi>Iob;</hi> so it is not against the analogie of faith to thinke that our tongues and mouthes may then employ them selues in endlesse vocall hymnes and songs of thanksgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, of glory and worship to him that sitteth vpon the throne, and to the Lambe who by his bloud hath redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med vs out of euery kindred, and tongue, &amp; people, and nation, and hath made vs Kings and Priests vnto God his Father. And sithence I haue been comforted from probable, sweet, and reuerend contemplations of the more learned, to thinke that some sympathie may be betwixt the musicall Harmonie and the Angelicall na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it maketh me to presume a little vpon these follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing speaches, to dispute whether there may not also bee a secret antipathie and enmitie naturall betwixt Musicke and wicked Spirits.</p>
            <p>The reason of which when we begin to consider, wee finde it more sublime and remote from our sensible ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitie, then to search the causes of these other things, which euill spirits are also thought to abhorre: and therefore it doth argue, that Musicke is a thing superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall and heauenly. We read that the Deuils do migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily hate the presence of fire, of salt, and of Musicke, the fire because it is life and light, and Satan is the Prince of darknes, and delighteth in darknesse; the salt because it hath a virtue to purge corruption, it is the marke of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie, and he seeketh by all meanes to corrupt, defile, and destroy, which is the reason why God commanded in the old Law to put salt vpon the Table of his Sanctuarie, and to haue Salt specially in the sacrifice, forbidding by the contrarie to put honie or wine therein, to signifie that wee must offer the sacrifice of our prayers to God with sobrietie and prudence, not mixed with flatteries, or bold speeches. God saith in the Law, I shall make with you a couenant of <hi>Salt,</hi> that is of perpetuitie, as many are of opinion, that the changing of the wife of <hi>Lot</hi> into a pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of <hi>Salt,</hi> was, as to say, a perpetuall Statue, but when
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:4124:126"/>
wee come to seeke the cause why the Musicke is fled of the Diuell, wee finde it more subtle, if the opinion were true of the Academicks, who say that the Diuells be not onely bodily but elementarie, mid-creatures betwixt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible <note place="margin">Arist: Metaph: 4.</note> and invisible bodies, <hi>animalia scilicet corpore aëria mente rationalia, animo passiua, tempore aeterna.</hi> Then might wee be induced without running to other myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to acknowledge some reason why they cannot abide the melodie of Musicke, nor no delectable suffumigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by that which is read of the exorcismes of <hi>Salomon,</hi> and of the smoake of the fish of <hi>Tobia,</hi> but the difficultie to know the demoniack nature &amp; substance maketh this contemplation remoter. <hi>S. August:</hi> saith in his last chap: of the 3. <hi>de Trinit:</hi> that the Diuells are corporall, as <hi>Basil, Gregor: Epiph:</hi> say as much, whereon this sort of demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration is founded. There is but one infinite substance, the supreme essence, a substance cannot be finite, but by extremities of superficies, and that doth only belong to corporall things, and therefore those spirits must bee corporall because they are finite. Alwaies the more common opinion of Theologie is, as of <hi>Damasc: Greg. Nazianz: Thomas Aquinas,</hi> and of the <hi>Master of the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences,</hi> that the Angels and the Diuels be formes both pure, and simple, and that both can forme themselues in visible bodies, when they would effect any thing bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily, which is testified of the Angells by their appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to <hi>Iacob,</hi> to <hi>Moses,</hi> to <hi>Eliah,</hi> to <hi>Abatuck.</hi> Of the Diuells againe testified by experience inquestio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable, of the aquilonar <hi>Succubi</hi> and <hi>Incubi,</hi> testified by the Cabalists, who affirme that vncleane spirits do often take the shapes of Bucks, ston'd Horses, and such like creatures repleat with bestiall luxurie, wherevpon, say they, proceedeth that in Leuiticus, that you goe not to sacrifice to those Bucks and Satyres; and that in <hi>Esay</hi> of the destruction of Babell, <hi>Zijm</hi> shall lodge there, and their streets shall bee full of <hi>O him: Satyres</hi> shall dance there, and <hi>

againe by many places of holy Scripture, the Diuell spake bodily to <hi>Adam,</hi> to <hi>Christ.</hi> Hee tooke the person of <hi>Samuel,</hi> albeit that <hi>Iustin: Martyr,</hi> and many of the Hebrew Doctors reason that it was <hi>Samuel</hi> himselfe, as well because of that Text of Ecclesiasticus, where it is said that <hi>Samuel</hi> did prophesie after his death, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause of the answer giuen to <hi>Saul,</hi> which seemeth to bee full of pietie, pronouncing the name of <hi>GOD</hi> sixe or seauen times, holding that <hi>Saul</hi> was not condemned eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally as they thinke, but in the estate of that incestuous man, who was ordayned by <hi>S. Paul</hi> to bee excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, to the end his bodie being chastned, his soule might be saued. Yet <hi>S. Augustine</hi> and the best Diuines stand for it that it was <hi>Satan</hi> and not <hi>Samuel,</hi> which no doubt is the onely sound opinion; <hi>Scotus subtilis</hi> in the second booke of his Sentences saith, that the Angells assumed bodies not to bee ioyned or vnited with them hypostati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, but to moue them and vse them as instruments, much more then saith he, the Diuells can assume bodies because they are more elementarie, as they doe change themselues in bodies, so from this same ground it is affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that they can also change bodies.</p>
            <p>For three things we obserue in Gods works, Creation, which is onely proper vnto himself, to make of no thing by the power of his word; Generation, which hee hath allowed to his Creatures themselues, by a naturall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and appetite of succession to haue a power of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; and lastly, Transmutation, whereof hee hath giuen power vnto Starres and to the Spirits, as saith <hi>Them: de Aquin: Omnes Angeli boni &amp; mali habent ex virtute naturali potestate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> transmutandi corpora nostra.</hi> All the Angells, good and bad, haue by a naturall instinct power to change our bodies; wee see how the Sorcerers of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did counterset the miracles of <hi>Moses. Iob</hi> saith there is no power on earth like vnto that of Satan, which prooues that the actions of the euill Spirits are actions indeed but extraordinarily, so that wee must not
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:4124:127"/>
thinke them illusions, or prestigitations of our eyes. <hi>Augustine</hi> chap: 9. of the third booke <hi>de Trinitate,</hi> saith thus: <hi>Mali Angelipro subtilitate sui sensus in occultioribus elementorum seminibus norunt, vnde rana &amp; serpentes nas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuntur &amp; hac per certas temperationum opportunitates occul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis motibus adhibendo faciunt creari.</hi> The wicked Angells by their subtle sense and knowledge of the secret seeds of nature, know by what meanes the Frogs and Serpents are made, and by vsing of certaine tymous temperations they can accelerate their Creation. Againe they haue power of transportation, whereupon some follow the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant <hi>Viretus,</hi> who holdeth it a fortitude of imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in melancholious women, who apprehend they bee carried with the deuill, albeit antiquity hath esteemed it for a true ground, that seldome doth a woman die of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholie, or a man of excessiue ioy: for melancholie proceedeth of to much heat and drinesse, and breedeth wisedome as <hi>Galen</hi> saith in his Booke <hi>De atra Bile,</hi> to nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of which two is a woman subiect, being of nature humid, cold, and passiue, and therefore not wise, as <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> among a thousand men one, among women none. Besides that the Septentrinall people with whom the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleane spirits are said to be most familiar, they haue as little melancholie as those haue of flegme, who dwell in Africke, which sheweth the leuitie and weakenesse of this opinion of <hi>Viret:</hi> Alwayes there be two sorts of transpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, one in bodie and spirit, the other in abstraction onely of the spirit, as to say <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was rapt in his spirit from Babel to Ierusalem, it might be in spirit or in body. The Hebrew Doctours hold in their remote Theolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gie, that the Angels make oblation to God of the soules of his Saints, who become dead by way of this abstracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, alleadging for it this passage of the 116. <hi>Psalme, Speciosa in conspectu Dominimors sanctorum suorum,</hi> Preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the sight of the Lord is the death of his Saints, but to denie that transportation which is both in body and spirit, were to denie the Scripture, <hi>Eliah, Enoch, Abacucke,</hi>
               <pb n="230" facs="tcp:4124:128"/>
were transported, and in the Euangelists, our Sauiour cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porally transported by Satan, to the pinacle of the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and after vpon a mountaine: The best Theologes hold, that <hi>Habacucke</hi> was indeed soule and bodie trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and so Saint <hi>Philip</hi> the Apostle, whereupon <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> reasoneth thus: If it bee possible in one, it is also possible in moe: and in like maner, both he, and <hi>Durand Herne,</hi> &amp; S. <hi>Bonauenture</hi> do make this argument. If Satan can abstract the spirit from the body, much more can he transport both, because the separation is more miraculous of the two, and is next vnto the veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of Gods word, the strongest argument we haue for the immortality of the soule, and an argument subiected to reason; For saith <hi>Aristotle</hi> in his ninth booke <hi>De Anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus,</hi> if the soule can doe any thing without the body, then it should be immortall, alwayes this Aphairisis, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stasis, or ablation of the soule, is a thing most vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table: the Scripture approueth it in diuers places, speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the persons of Saint <hi>P. aul</hi> and Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Philosophers haue acknowledged it, <hi>Plato,</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi> did call the bodie, <hi>Antrum animae:</hi> the cauerne of the soule, the chiefest Sorcerers who know it by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence haue acknowledged it, <hi>Zoreaster</hi> did call the body the sepulchre of the spirit, and the great <hi>Orpheus</hi> did call it the prison of the soule, and to reason euen naturally, we see that locall motion can be some times without tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of bodies, but onely by vertue of the agent, as the sea is mooued by the moone, which is distant from it more, then 50000. Leagues, and the Iron is drawen to mooue by Magnes or the Loadstone, without any tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, which being so in things so insensible and Inani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal as Iron, much more it may be in things not onely animal: but who haue their greatest force and vigour in that locall abstraction, as our soules be most <hi>Galliard,</hi> when they be most remote from the body: And for this point of Satans power to transport, I say, that while that Cherubin which moues the eight Spheare, wherein there

fixed stars, doth role it Millions of miles in one houre: what matter is there of admiration, if Satan can transport a body some few miles vpon the earth.</p>
            <p>Lastly, there is the commerce or copulation of good and bad spirits with men and women, and whether it be really, locally, or per exsta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Againe, the plague of pestilence, and such cotagious things doe enter in a mans body in a spirituall sort to possesse it. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth testifie this reall, and locall copulation of good spirits with good men; our bodies are said to be the Temples of the holy Ghost: Our Sauiour hath said that the father and he would dwell in him, who obey his will. The Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> speaking of his vocation by God, to preach to the Iewes, I fell downe said he vpon my face, and the spirit which entered in me, did raise me vp, and set me on foote. In like sort, of euill spirits, the euill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord is said to enter into <hi>Saul</hi> really, and the spirit of Satan into <hi>Iudas,</hi> and our Sauiour did eiect di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers reall and sensible deuils, because their voyces were heard: The oddes and distinction of these in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is this, the good spirits hath more celestiall and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile bodies, and so their possession of men and copulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them being more spirituall then others: It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so more perceiued by the actions of our spirit, then by any change of our bodies: whereas <hi>Demones,</hi> as Saint <hi>August</hi> in his tenth Booke <hi>De ciuitate Det, Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus in Summa 2.

the Chaldean interpreters say, that there bee so many principall lights in heauen, and as many Angels to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne them, and <hi>Leo Hebreus</hi> hath written in his second Booke, that the eight heauen, or <hi>primum mobile,</hi> which maketh his couse in twenty foure houres, is moued by a Cherubin with such miracolous swiftnesse, that euery moments motion ariseth to more then a million of miles. And of the Angelike care of the Saints of God on earth, the Scriptures are full of testimonies, that which guarded the Israelites comming from Egypt, that which wrastled with <hi>Iacob</hi> and blessed him, that Ceraphin which purged the lips of <hi>Esay</hi> and made him eloquent, that <hi>Raphael</hi> whose presence <hi>Asmodeus</hi> cannot abide, those Angels who carried <hi>Lazarus</hi> into the bosome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> that which deliuered S. <hi>Peter</hi> out of prison, that which went with <hi>Azariah</hi> into the furnace, and made him thinke the flames a soft deaw, and so forth.</p>
            <p>The Lord God doth not only furnish vs with spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all armes against Satan: as by the power of his Angels, by the force of his word, and by our faith in Christ: but he hath taught vs some familiar things which they cannot indure in nature as is thought; as the fire, whose presence doth terrifie him by a mysterious antipathy, as the presence of the Wolfe astonisheth a Sheepe, because God who is his enemy is a fire, a lampe, a <hi>light</hi> of glory and power to the godly; a fire of loue, mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and to the wicked a consuming fire of wrath and vengeance: and as by a naturall strife the voyce of a ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannous Schoolemaster, doth affraye a wayward childe, so doth the sound of musicall instruments, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the praises of God, afflict and terrifie the diuell by a naturall <hi>Antipathy,</hi> wherewith God hath indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them. Againe, the harmony of musicke doth by a naturall simpathy collect, and vnite the distracted pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our weake mindes to greater strength and deuoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and is <hi>quasi vehiculum</hi> the conduct of deuotion.

the issue of the battell, he would not doe it vntill hee first caused to sound vp an instrument of musicke, and then he fell into his Prophesie: wee read likewise that when <hi>Samuel</hi> had consecrated king <hi>Saul:</hi> God (said hee to him) to the Mountaine and thou shalt finde a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Prophets who sound instruments and prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, thou shalt enter among them, and the spirit of God shall come vpon thee there, and thou shalt bee changed into another man: the reason of this naturall antipathy betwixt <hi>Musicke</hi> and the Diuell is, because it is a diuine thing which draweth the spirit to harmony, concord, loue, and heauenly contemplation, and the constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his nature is contrary to these, to be seditious, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordant, and implacable.</p>
            <p>This whole Fabricke of the world is nothing else but a musicall order of Gods workes, they stand as the Scripture saith, <hi>in numero, pendere &amp; mensura,</hi> by num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, weight, and measure. All the creatures are but a musicke, euery one hauing in their kindes, their <hi>Supreme</hi> or <hi>Alt,</hi> their Counter <hi>Base,</hi> and their Tenor, to shew it in few examples. Among the Planets, the austerity of <hi>Saturne,</hi> and the rigour of <hi>Mars</hi> are tempered, and tied together with the serenity of <hi>Iupiter,</hi> as among the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the repugnance of the fire and water are kept in concordance, by the promiscuall qualities of the ayre, and speaking of the inteligentiall world, the Angels are a mediate creature betwixt the diuine Essence and man: man is a mid couple betwixt good and euill spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, the Ape betwixt man and fourefooted beasts, the <hi>Niriades &amp; Tritoues,</hi> which be not things fabulous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt men and fishes.

Summer and Winter be contrary, but by the harmony of the spring time they are conioyned: blacke and white contrary do meet in mediate colours, heate and cold againe contrary agree in tepidity, swift and slow doe meet in a temperate motion; the austerity of <hi>Hannibal,</hi> and the meekenesse of <hi>Fabius</hi> agree in mid constitutions: In end, there is nothing which wanteth this sweet combination and harmony, except Satan and his following spirits, betwixt whom and God, betwixt whom and his Saints, betwixt whom &amp; goodnes, peace, concord, loue, and vnity, there is no knot nor euer shall be: but being of their proper corruption enemies to God and nature, rebellious, factious, malitious spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of discordance, and distraction, they doe naturally abhorre the sound of <hi>Harmony</hi> and <hi>Musicke.</hi> So that for that point of vnion with the Church of England, which standeth in the restitution of the <hi>Organs,</hi> I thinke this will suffice apparantly to perswade any well disposed and iudicious man, who hath not his braine set in <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balis m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               <pb n="237" facs="tcp:4124:131"/>
Now I come to the ceremonie of the Clericall habit which is in the Church of England, &amp; forbearing to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son <note place="margin">Of Clericall vestiments.</note> in generall of the expediency and good and neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarie vse of graue and Maiestique ceremonies in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like actions of state and ciuill gouernments, without which it were not so easie to procure and maintaine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular reuerence to any auctoritie whatsoeuer, and which be a true edification in Gods Church, if not of our vnderstanding, yet of our affections, when out dull and secure mindes are stirred vp to a greater measure of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and deuotion, through beholding the exteriour Maiesty of Religious Ceremonies; onely for the Church Minister his habit in particular I wil deliuer my opinion in sobriety thus. There was neuer any age in the world which did not distinguish Counsellours and State-rulers from the people, and the religious professours from the Laity, by their robes peculiar to themselues, as God we see himselfe did institute <hi>Aaron.</hi> Therefore now, while Christian Pastours bee more truely venerable and reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerent, because their function holdeth nothing of types but is perfect, to say that they should not haue an honourable and comely apparell proper to them, and not permitted to be carried of others, it is meerely idle and absurd. That he who is sequestred from the ordinary ciuill vocations in the world and consecrated to God, who is the intercessour and ambassadour of the people vnto the throne of grace, to offer out spirituall sacrifice, to be secret and in a sort familiar with God, that such a sacred person, place and calling should not bee cloathed with externall marked of sanctitie and holy profession, which markes ought not to be assumed by ciuill men, I doe perswade my selfe that no man will affirme it.</p>
            <p>Which ground breing true in the generall, to come to a speciall consideration of the Church-vestiment and to a comparison betwixe the white surplis and the blacke gowne, I would say the eullours be either in different or not indifferent, if they bee indifferent, then there is no
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:4124:132"/>
great matter of debate, but for vnities sake, wee ought ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to embrace that which our neighbour Church haue receiued from orthodoxall antiquitie, then that they ought for our sake, to follow that which is more late; If they be not indifferent, then the minister ought to carry that colour, which of the two is most sutable to his person, but I subsume that the white is most suta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his person, therefore it is most fitting that hee bee cloathed therewith, my assumption I take to be true for these reasons, the white is most decent, most ancient, and most vsefull in the Church.</p>
            <p>For the first the decency of Apparell standeth in two points, one is in that which doth most viuely represent to our mindes the nature of a mans calling, his degree or age, as the readdish colour doth fit a soldier, and the black a Schooleman and such like, another is in that which doth best distinguish a particular professour from all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of different callings, the first of the two doth note a man himselfe in his own property, the second doth note the discrepance of other men from him: For distinction of seuerall professours, wee must confesse the white is more decent for a Pastour, because the blacke gowne is common to the Physician, to the Lawyer, the School<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and the Preacher, and is not forbidden to any who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer: And for noting the discrepance of the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of our professions, the white is much more signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant of Pastorall function then the black as I shall shew heereafter.</p>
            <p>For the second touching antiquity, the white is ancient in the Church, S. <hi>Chrysost.</hi> maketh mention of it in his time, speaking of the grauitie of the administration of the Sacraments, <hi>Hom. ad pop. Antioch.</hi> 60. for if (saith he to the priests) a beast whose mouth were polluted with filthines should come to drink in a cleere fountain wherof ye had vse or benefit, ye would not suffer him to lay downe his mouth, and why will yee suffer those who bee defiled with odious and abominable vices to put downe their
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:4124:132"/>
mouthes in the pure fountaine of Christs blood, <hi>Hac ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stra dignitas</hi> (saith hee) <hi>hac securitas, haec omnis corona, non quod albam &amp; splendentem tunicam induti circumeatis,</hi> In your consciencious distribution of the holy Sacrament, is your dignitie, your security, and the crowne of your glory more then in that white and splendid Coate which yee carry in the administration of them, as if one should say to a scholler graduate in the vniuersity, your honour &amp; reputation which you haue abroad, lieth not so much in the gowne, or hood, or scarlet roabe which you weare, as in the learning &amp; endowment which ye shew in your disputations and writings, so as from such speech may be gathered; that in the vniuersities such habits are vsed for distinction and ornament in degrees of schoole, euen so it is cleerely seene by those words of <hi>Chrisostome,</hi> that the Church seruice in his time and before him hath been adorned with such vestiments; And Saint <hi>Hierom, Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tra Pelag.</hi> against those who in his time did despise the white Clericall vestiments, what a madnesse (saith he) is that to count it enimity with God, if a Bishop, Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter, or Deacon, goe cloathed in their comely white roabe in the seruice of God.</p>
            <p>For the third, that the white is more vsefull, it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth this way, speaking of a pastorall habit the white hath a more easie open &amp; vnderstandble interpretation then the blacke: The blacke wee knowe is a mourning habite, where as the white representeth ioyfulnesse, and therefore is most proper to him who bringeth the glad tydings of the Gospell, while as their is a simpathie between his colors and his commission: We doe find in the Scripture often mention of white for a sacred and holy apparell, but neuer of the blacke, if the Angels of God, who be his heauenly Ministers haue appeared be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men in their ministration cloathed in white, to say that those who bee sacred ministers of the mysteries of Gods Church heere vpon earth, cannot finde more di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine shapes or colours to appeare in before the world, it
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:4124:133"/>
is an interpretation not extorted, but plaine and sensibly offered out of the nature of the thing it selfe. And as it is necessarily required, in speciall aboue the rest, in the Minister, that when hee vttereth to God the publique prayers of the Church, to which they doe resound their <hi>Amen,</hi> and administreth the holy Sacraments, that then he must come with fore-thought and fore-sought purity of soule and bodie, both free from other studies, and other actions, which at other times were not to bee bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, is it not expedient also, that with his inward sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, hee shall bring an exterior shew thereof, to purchase the greater reuerence of the people, and to season their mindes with holy apprehensions, and with present de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires to consort inwardly in their hearts with that visible habite of puritie and integritie which they doe contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate in his person.</p>
            <p>Wherefore it was a custome in the primitiue Church, as wee may read in many of the Fathers, that all those, who being <hi>Catechumeni</hi> presented themselues to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme, should be arrayed in white, wherevpon this title hath growne of <hi>Dominica in albis,</hi> white-sunday, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in wee may consider the iudgement of the purer age of the Church, who thought it expedient, that by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward candor and integritie, which the concurring grace of God, the soule and the whole person of the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized did receiue being dipped and drenched in the lauar of regeneration, should be not onely infixed by faith in the inward apprehension of the minde of the receiuer, but also testified by that publike and pure marke of whitenesse vnto others their spectators, and brethren partakers formerly of the same new birth; whereby wee see, what extent the authoritie and iudgement of the guides and gouernours in Gods Church hath, in things, though not enacted nor imposed by the writings or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutions of the Apostles, yet afterward thought expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, for the better edifying and furnishing the people of God, in externall, and in a sort ceremoniall addita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:4124:133"/>
which of themselues, being not superstitious, but hauing a holy, sober, and wholesome vse of instruction, and reuerence in the sacred duties of the church (though perhaps not onely afterward, but euen then, they might by some priuate misinterpretation of superstitious and ignorant men be abused) were by the most and best, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted, maintayned, and reteyned, being indeed not to be abrogated but by the same hand which set them vp.</p>
            <p>But to prosequute my argument for the white vesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Pastor, in shewing how it is vsefull and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly significant, I say all the varieties of <hi>Aarons</hi> robe were contriued by intermixing a fine white linnen, as you may read. Whensoeuer mention is made of Christ clothed, it is either in glory and light, or in white lynnen; <hi>Induit enim stola gloriae, amictus erat lumine sicut vestiment<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>, Ezech:</hi> 9. when Commission was giuen to fixe destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angels against Ierusalem, the man who stood in the midst hauing power to saue the Saints, who wept for Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem (no doubt <hi>Iesus Christ)</hi> he was clothed in white Lynnen. It is clearely said of Christ, <hi>Bissus &amp; purpura indumentum eius,</hi> white lynnen and purple, euen so it is said in the Apocalyps of the Church, <hi>Mulier illa amicta erat purpura &amp; Bysso,</hi> that woman was clothed with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and white lynnen. The white lynnen doth represent puritie and innocencie, therefore it is said in the Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyps, <hi>Byssinum sunt instificationes Sanctorum,</hi> the iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Saints is as white and fine lynnen pure and <note place="margin">Apoc: 18. 19.</note> perfect, so that if any man will say that the robe of <hi>Aaron</hi> was altogether a Iewish type, and that Clericall vesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are of no respect after the comming of Christ, I thinke it idle, that Candlesticke of the Arke which was clothed with the Hyacinth and celestiall colour, likely might be a Type which is abolished, or what did carrie the scarlet and reddish colour in that Robe, it may bee holden expired, because it did figure the passion which is performed; or in like manner, what was partie-colou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, as <hi>Ioseph</hi> who alwaies figured Christ, he was a Type
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:4124:134"/>
also by reason of his coate sprinkled with blood, as it is in Ezechiel, <hi>sumpsisti vestiment a multicoloria;</hi> and againe, <hi>Quare vestimentum tuum rubrum est?</hi> you haue chosen <note place="margin">Ezech: 16.</note> a Robe which is particoloured. what meaneth it thy gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are red? Certes, as these colours were figuratiue, so are they expired, <hi>Ioseph</hi> hath changed his Coate. The text of Genesis saith, <hi>mutauerunt vestes eius &amp; ipsum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duerunt Bisso,</hi> Pharoah commanded to change his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and to clothe him in fine white lynnen, and Christ hath also changed his garments into meere whitenesse and iustification, as I haue said, and his Church hath changed her garments into white, <hi>Bissus indumentum eius, &amp; mulier illa amicta erat Bisso.</hi> And therefore hath the Wiseman said in Ecclesiast: <hi>omni tempore sint vestimenta</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Eccles: 9.</note> 
               <hi>tua candida:</hi> so that nothing can be so fitting for a Priest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Pastorall habit, as the the garment of Christ himselfe, and of his Church in the holy Scripture.</p>
            <p>In which respects it seemes that wee are to reuerence antiquitie, and to thinke that not without graue causes they haue brought in that Ceremonie into Christs Church, and left it vnto vs. For whether it was deriued from the Iewish Church or no, I doe not dispute, but who would not say that the Leuiticall vestiments were rather things depending from the policie, then figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Ceremonies expiring in the exhibition of Christ. I would aske him of those Pomgrannets &amp; Bells which were tyed to the fringe of <hi>Aarons</hi> robe, to signifie that in Priestly actions there should bee continually a good smell, and from their mouthes a perpetuall sound of pietie in our eares, and of those twelue gemmes planted vpon the breast plate of <hi>Aaron</hi> with a Diamond in the midst, which was the most principall, conspicuous, and pretious part of the Robe, what these did figure in his person, which is not yet most proper and conuenient to bee figured by vestiments in the person of a Christian Prelate, wherevpon <hi>Epiphanius</hi> Archbishop of Cyprus, and after him <hi>S. Ierom</hi> haue made these obseruations,
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:4124:134"/>
vpon these texts of Exod: &amp; Leuit: The Gemmes first being excellent things of rare constitution doe note the dignitie of the priestly Function. Secondly, they sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie the doctrine and christian vertues which should be in him who carrieth that dignitie, that euen as those gemmes haue their secret and miraculous operations, so should Prelates and Priests by the secret inspiration of Gods spirit, bee able to worke in people miraculous and extraordinarie effects of Gods feare and obedience. Thirdly, as these Gemmes are full in our eyes, of a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stiall beautie and splendor, so should the cariage of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men shine in our eyes, for a cleare mirrour and example, that when we looke into it we may by the light thereof discerne our owne blots and darknes. Fourthly, as the gemmes haue diuine and admirable formes but small matter, and that a substance more coelestiall then earthly, as wee see. Euen so Prelates and Priests ought not to be so earthly as other men are, drowned in mortal passions, spotted with ambition, pride, and auarice, defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with lust or other fleshly concupiscences, wherevnto the greatest part of men are obnoxious, but they should all consist of spirituall formes, and of the puritie of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplarie sinceritie, like vnto Angelicall and diuine crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Fifthly, as the gemmes haue simpathising quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with the spirit of man, in a sort, as if they were animal creatures, that they will not onely change their proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and colours, at any great chance which hapneth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, but they presege and forewarne our capitall dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, they redeeme vs from them, as it were by giuing themselues for our ransome, they cannot endure that by brutish luxurie wee should bee turned into beasts, things which neither Theologie, nor Philosophie make doubt of, as being approued by daily experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.

virtue to encourage the heart against feare or doubts, The Saphir to stirre vp the mind to deuotion, wherefore it is vsually carried by Prelates and religious men, as wee see, the Smerald to banish the spirit of lust, &amp; to temper that affection in men, wherunto it is opposed by a secret antipathie, that <hi>Albertus</hi> writes how a king of Hungarie who delighted greatly in a rare stone of this kind, one night after he had committed some acte of abominable lust, he found it broken in three pieces: and of <hi>Nero</hi> who tooke such pleasure in the Smerald, that it was called the Iewell of <hi>Nero,</hi> carrying vpon his thumbe one of huge quantitie, formed in table, wherein he did from his Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace see the Amphitheatrall sports, as if he had bin there, and with which he did solace and helpe his sore eyes, a thing proper also to that stone, another night in like sort after some beastly pollution of his body, hee found his Iewell rent in pieces: Euen so Prelates and Priests, who haue the charge of mens soules, they are not only to sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathise with them, by feeling of their miseries, changing from ioy to sorrow for their iniquities, and from sorrow againe to ioyfulnesse for their conuersion: like vnto <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,</hi> they are not onely to supplie the place of the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond, to inspire into their hearts a courage and constan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie in faith, the place of the Saphir to indue them with piety and deuotion, the place of the Smerald to clense them from the filthinesse: but if need be, they must take the place of the Turquine to giue their liues for their flocke, like vnto <hi>Moses,</hi> who for that peoples sake, wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed to be raised out of the booke of life, like vnto Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who wished to be made <hi>Anathema,</hi> for his flocke, and like vnto the glorious Martyrs in the Primitiue Church, and as S. <hi>Augustine</hi> saith vpon the 86. <hi>Psalme,</hi> By these twelue Gems in the <hi>Apocalips,</hi> is meant the Church of Christ, founded vpon the twelue Apostles, and by that royall infrangible Diamond which is in the midst, the eternall stabilitie of the Throne of Christ, which so oft as it hath bene seene by the transported spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:4124:135"/>
of the Prophets and Apostles, it appeared in their eyes as these fiery and celestiall Iewels; So that seeing the chiefe doctours of the Church haue so interpreted the brestplate of <hi>Aaron,</hi> we must not thinke that all the ceremonies of his Priestly habite did necessarily expire in the comming of Christ.</p>
            <p>Now if wee will say that the Brasen serpent must bee broken powder, the white Surplis is daily abused to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrie in the Papall Church: and therefore it ought to be abolished, certaine if the case were alike, the argument is good, but it is much different: First, the brasen Serpent was the proper and onely obiect of the Idolatrie com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the Iewes, putting a kind of Dietie in that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, but in the Popes Masse, howsoeuer polluted with diuers superstitions and idolatries; the idolatrous acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therein are not terminated vpon, or intended to, the garment which the Priest weareth, the Surplis being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one of the accidentary adiuncts, which, as it were vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the by, doe for externall ornament, and for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and significant representation, accompany that acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, euen as there were tyed to the end of <hi>Aarons</hi> roabe, Pomegranates &amp; bels, as I haue showen before. And as it was neuer hard, that any spectator of the Masse did adore the Surplis, worne by the Priest, so I thinke none of the most superstitions worshippers of those incarnate wafers, did euer dreame the supposed transubstantiation to bee wrought by the vertue of any operatiue holines inherent in that vestiment.</p>
            <p>Secondly, if whatsoeuer kind of attyre (of distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) was then worne by the Priest in Massing, must bee vtterly abandoned, as polluted with idolatrie: what warrant hath any Minister of the Gospell in Diuine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice to weare a blacke gowne, while as Priests doe weare such vnder their Surplices, not wholly couered, but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing commonly beneath the skirts thereof, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps such Priests haue thought their Masse as vnperfite without a gowne, as without a Surplice.</p>

               </gap>ces, as haue beene blotted with su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious seruice, the reason were more sutable and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable; as for example, it were euill done to vse for the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament in reformed Churches, that very parcell of bread, which hath beene consecrated to be the <hi>Hostie</hi> of the Masse: yet to take for our vse of that same lumpe, or of that same loafe, before the Papall Consecration ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, it were no wrong, nor iust scandall, so to take excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on against the white vestiment of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, because of the Idolatrous Surplice of the Papall Church it is sophisticate, <hi>Ab indiuiduo ad speciem,</hi> neuer a man in the Church of England, will hold that the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plice is operatiue, or doth conferre holinesse<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but because it is a comely habite, receiued from antiquitie, and found by them in their Churches, most decent, and most signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant of any: therefore doe they carrie it, as also to shew their meeke and ready obedience to the authoritie of their Church and lawes of their state; nor neuer a man of true Christian wisedome, who doth abhorre it, <hi>Eo ipso,</hi> because it is in the Church of Rome. Among the Babi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians there were some sacred vessels of the holy Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as is said; but alas for pittie, many of vs doe build the wall of our separation from Rome, to such dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable height, that if it stand, wee shall neuer re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne to play the true Christians in weeping for the holy Sanctuarie. Such was the simplicitie and sweet simpathy of the greatest doctours of antiquitie, that they would not condemne any thing receiued from their forefathers in the Church, except it was repugnant to Gods word, yea, they would rather turne away their eyes, then looke curiously vpon that which might breed vnto them a scruple against the peace and quietnes of the Church; so were they gouerned with the spirit of charitie: but such is our seuerity now adayes, that we doe looke vpon eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry circumstance, with the iealous eyes of <hi>Iuno,</hi> prying into the smallest shadowes of occasions, that are not to
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:4124:136"/>
our humour, so hath one impetuous and vehement zeale extinguished our loue, and too much curiositie drowned our meekenesse, <hi>Confregimus iugum &amp; rupimus vincula,</hi> we haue broken the bonds of Christian concord and harmonie, as is said before.</p>
            <p>The holy Spirit of charity should worke among di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stracted Christians, like vnto that animall spirit of the Magnes, or Loadstone, which although it do banish and chase away Iron by the one end, yet it is mightily attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiue by the other: euen so although we should abhorre the Idolatrous points of the Popish Church, yet by our kindly sympathising with things, which be without error among them: wee should contract and draw them as neere vnto vs as is possible, but all in contrary, the name of Poperie is become more odious to some of vs, then the name of Paganisme: and if we do not loue the Turke more then a Papist, perhaps wee doe lesse hate him, which is the reason why nothing can content vs, but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute derelinquishment of all and whatsoeuer is into the Church of Rome concerning the worship of God, yea I do thinke there be among vs, who if they knew how the Pope and his Priests doe eate, they would striue to take their meat in an other sort, that they might refuse to him the Communion of nature: But as it were an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant part to refuse to eate of delicate and wholesome fruits, because wee doe not see the root whereof they spring, nor the secret conueyes of that moysture which doth nourish them, or to refuse to dwell in splendid and commodious houses, because we doe not see the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall stones whereupon they were builded, euen so, no question, it is an idle and euill part in vs, if we doe not feed vpon the spirituall fruits of the Gospel, peace, loue, and vnanimitie; or if we refuse to dwell in one Arke, because we cannot find to our curiositie all the reasons of the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, whereby it hath beene builded: doe not wee con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne the fruits of the Gospel, when by our discrepance in matter of ceremonies, indifferent at least, if not vsefull,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:4124:137"/>
wee make the Papist to say that the diuision of our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage doth testifie that we are the Gyants, who enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Tower of heresie, and when one Pastor doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that his brother within the bowels of one Church and one kingdome doth carrie an idolatrous habite in the seruice of God. yea when a Presbyter doth avouch that his ordinarie Bishop is Antichristian, is not that a scandalous opposition within one particular church, like to the twins of <hi>Rebecca,</hi> who shooke each other in their mothers wombe, whereby she became mightily afraid and dolorous, for if wee doe flatter our selues to thinke these light differences vnworthy the name of separation, wee must remember that small sparkles doe easily conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate a great flame, chiefly when there be such cunning bellowes to set it a fire as the Iesuitique practises which be lurking among vs, as the remanent of the Canaanites among the people of Israel. And to conclude this point I pray God of his mercy, that this kind of vnnecessarie distraction, doe not make vs one day to say as <hi>Cyprian</hi> did, lamenting the Church persecution for the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his time; These euills (saith he) had not come vpon the brethren, if they had been linked together in the brotherly concord.</p>
            <p>As concerning the rest of the Ceremonies being in the Church of England, certainely they are not of that weight that wee need to insist on them. And seeing it hath pleased the Lord to blesse these disordered begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings of our Reformation here in Scotland, by our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vnion with the ancient orthodoxall policie of his Church, why should we not meet this mercifull dealing of God by our voluntarie acceptation of whatsoeuer in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different Ceremonie not contrarie to Gods word, which is in our neighbour Church? yea rather in the bowells of our owne Church, according to the opinion of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and sincere Diuines, to the effect that wee may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue that the obloquie of our enemies, which we vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie, why should we not be altogether consentient among

It is true that the Church of Rome wil not willingly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that example of <hi>Daniel,</hi> to confesse before the Lord that her Pope, her Cardinalls, her Priests, that both her Consistory and her Cloysters, haue declined to fearefull Idolatry and abuses, but what? yet no man will imagine but God hath destinate a time for the reformation of so many Churches as haue drunken of that cup, hee hath hung aboue her head the sword of his great seruant <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet,</hi> wherewith hee hath chastised <hi>Ierusalem, Antioch, Alexandria,</hi> and many other mother Churches, he hath the sword of his omnipotent Word, which hath alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy wrought admirable effects since the time of <hi>Luther:</hi> If we shall wish her to be reformed by <hi>Mahometan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Such is the credit of the primitiue Church, for three or foure hundred yeres, that there is not a learned Doctor on either side, who is not content to say, that shee may be iudge in all controuersies, either touching Doctrine, Policy, or Ceremonies: nor is there any so impudent, who will derogate from that age for Christian reformation: They indeed who feede vpon the fatnesse of the Papall tyranny, they will decline the tryall, sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend so farre as lies in them the conuocation of generall Commissions, or illude them being assembled.</p>
            <p>But to take exception against the primitiue Church: no, so that nothing is wanting but the meanes of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Conuocations, which as I haue before discoursed at length, doth properly pertaine to Christian Princes, <hi>Cor regis in man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Christian should be found to put opposition: any man wil confesse this, The distraction indeed of these Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Princes, is the mystery of Papall ambition, and so studiously entertained by the seat of Rome, that one may say, we haue long to looke for that influence which must proceed from so extraordinary coniunction of these chiefe Planets: and I answere once for my aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, that whensoeuer any of the two last Kings, shall ioyne themselues to our most gracious Soueraigne, it shall suffice to sway the ballance, and to ouercome all oppositions. But I keepe mee on the ground, holding that present state of things doeth equally impose vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all Christian Princes, a meere necessitie of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currance to reforme the Church of Rome, because they bee equally distressed thereby: for while as vnto their predecessours did belong a right to conuocate Councels and to presidiate in them, hauing in their hands the raynes of Christian gouernment, as is before largely proued. Now Rome hath so farre delighted in her owne beauty, that shee hath drawne the whole splendor of the world vpon her selfe, and hath trampled on the necks of the greatest Kings, as she, to whom it was said, <hi>Dabo tibi potestatem in Gentes, &amp; reges eas in virga ferrea, &amp; sicut vasa fictilia conterentur:</hi> And this hath shee done so o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly and insolently as you haue heard, by violenting both Princes, Prelates, and religious orders within her owne bowels, that in our time, and in our eies, her pride mounted to the Meridia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> or Tropick, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whence by the very destiny of the instability of this inferiour world, she must returne to decline againe: so that this common iniury done by her in common to all Christian Kings, whom God hath deputed to be Pilots within the ship of his Church, doth force them to attention and ielousie, and draweth on this great <hi>Iubile</hi> of generall reformati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: And I presume it from this warrant, that all the States in Christendome which bee Catholike Romans, doe feele the grieuous burden of her tyrannous yoake;
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:4124:139"/>
as farre as those who bee opponents to her in matter of doctrine and pure religion.</p>
            <p>These Catholike States I comprehend in 5. the Estate Emperiall, the French, the Spaniard, the Venetian, and lastly the Dutchies within Italy. The story of the French calamities, is so fresh, that I neede not renew it, how that braue and puissant Kingdome hath beene put in combu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion by these prophane fires of Rome, and almost burnt into Funerall ashes, her Princes murdered, her lawes dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solued, her people massacred, her Churches violated, her cities desolate, and in such a case as Rome was in, when the Poet said of it <hi>desunt que manus p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>As for the Dukes of Italy there be only two of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: The Duke of Sauoy who with the allies of his house, the Dukes of Mantua and Modena haue their owne <hi>Cordoglio</hi> and greeuance against the grandure of Rome, and the coniunction thereof with Spaine, as may be well perceiued by these late tempests amongst them:
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:4124:140"/>
And the great Duke of Tuscan, who, although first hee be next neighbour to the Pope, and secondly, that he be the first of these who haue growen fat vpon the reuersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of S. <hi>Peters</hi> Trencher, his whole estate being contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued by Popes or Cardinals of his house, and thirdly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he be lately allied with the house of Austria, yet for all these, this open and shamelesse insolence of Rome vrged notlong since against the Segniory of Venice, hath made him <hi>Suegliato</hi> to stirre and rouse vp his eares so far, that against and in spight of this Iesuiticall insidiation which threatneth Christian Potentates, hee hath made a Law, that no lands, rents nor mooueables aboue a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly portion should be legacied to any Church person, Iesuite or other without his approbation added there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</p>
            <p>It followeth to speake of Spaine, which although it hath for many yeeres past, beene the principall arch of the papall pride, yet when wee consider how farre that great King hath beene frustrated of the ends propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to him by these who haue beene the chiefetiers of him to the Seate of Rome, I doe also presume that for good respects he may haue disposition to fall away from the Idoll of her dangerous ambition: Because the Iesuite (as is sayd) hauing a chiefe Maxime, that Religion must shoote out and flourish with a growing state, and finding Spaine most enclined to Monarchy, as he doth imagine, hath deuoted himselfe to the seruice of that Crowne, that by the encrease thereof his society may likewise grow, and beare authority throughout the world, and from this scope hath hee beene, and still studieth to bee the authour and broacher of many Christian calamities, and euer so vnfortunate for the Spaniard whom hee pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendeth to aduance, that in place of strengthning his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, the Iesuite hath beene a cankering worme to rippe the bowels of the same, and to plague them with consuming feauers of ambitious aspiring. By the Iesuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call documents were the braue seauenteene Prouinces of

the Netherlands so entreated of his Deputies, that as one taken with S. <hi>Authonies</hi> fire, hee hath beene constrained to cut them off being one of his most noble members, after he had sent from his treasures of Spaine about one hundred million of gold to cure the same.

Alwaies that ielousie and distraction is easie to grow betwixt Spaine and Rome. This is a strong reason for it, and approued by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; The Spaniards doe already possesse the richest patrimonies of <hi>S. Peter,</hi> Sicilia and Naples: that if a violent and headie Pope doe recounter a troubled estate in Spaine, it is like enough they will redemaund these, whereof the proofe was seene in the person of Pope Sixto Quinto, who fauoured <hi>Henry</hi> the third of France against the holy League for that same cause; vpon the other side we are to presume from the like rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, that the Spaniard hath no better meanes to possesse these things securely, then by clipping the winges of the Popish pride, since he hath already gotten the fatnesse of his pot; Experience hath in like manner qualified this, <hi>Carolus Quintus</hi> of Spaine, and <hi>Ferdinand</hi> and <hi>Maximi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> his Successors in the Empire, had no greater studies in their times, then to haue reformed the Church of Rome for Christian peace, and for their owne securitie, as is more particularly before rehearsed, the misgiuing whereof did breed so great griefe to himselfe before his death, and so great displeasure to his posteritie there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after.</p>
            <p>One other point maketh me to apprehend this dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the world to Catholike reformation; The whole Clergie of Rome is a thinking how to supplant the Iesuiticall Trafficke, and to extirpate those plagueful weedes, who by their large &amp; vniust priuiledges granted by ambitious Popes for their ambitious and wicked ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uices haue ouergone the whole religious orders of the Romane Church, invading their Functions at their pleasure, as one may well see in that little Treatise which some few yeares agoe came out against them, called

            </argument>
            <p>BVT finally of all the circumstances of this present world, there is one which doth most moue me to think that this great Iubile of the restitutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Church doth approach, and that we be already ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the prime of that new light. First, there is now a mightie Monarch of the Protestant side, alike to whom, hath not been in any time, his Maiestie of <hi>Great Britaine.</hi> Secondly, a Monarch of such authoritie with all the Protestant States and Princes in matters of Religion, that they giue vnto him the Style of the <hi>Great S<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stine</hi> to be <hi>flagellum haereticorum.</hi> Thirdly, a Monarch of that rare learning accompanied with the true wisdome of a temperate spirit, that euen the iudicious opponents except these who bee Iesuiticall, doe hold his Maiestie the most sufficient instrument to goe about and bring to passe a generall reformation, which points I will pray all those that shall read this discourse, to weigh in since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, as I shall compendiously set them downe for our edification, that wee may thankfully remarke the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous and mercifull dealing of God with our Age.</p>
            <p>There hath euer been since the first Creation, two generations in the world, one of <hi>Cain,</hi> one of <hi>Abel;</hi> one of <hi>Isaac,</hi> one of <hi>Ismael;</hi> one of <hi>Iacob,</hi> one of <hi>Esau;</hi> one of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> one of his malicious brethren; one of <hi>Dauid,</hi> one of <hi>Saul;</hi> one of <hi>Solomon,</hi> one of <hi>Absolon;</hi> one of <hi>Simon Peter,</hi> one of <hi>Simon Magus</hi> &amp;c. Arace of the iust,
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:4124:143"/>
and a race of the reprobate, making that admirable An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tithesis, wherevpon God doth hang the ballance of his glory swayed by his mercy to the one hand, and by his iustice to the other, this is the secret and hidden myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of Gods predestination in the gouernment of the world, <hi>numero, pondere, &amp; mensura,</hi> as the Scripture saith: And because the wicked as impetuous flouds do ouerflow the world, and ouercome the Saints of God with multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of wicked Princes and false Prophets, therefore the Lord doth oftentimes, as the storie of the Scripture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clareth, raise vp both in Church and State some men of extraordinarie vertue and goodnes to preserue the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full seed, which hath made the Psalmist to say, <hi>Mirabilis Deus in Sanctis suis,</hi> the Lord is admirable in his Saints. <note place="margin">Psal: 67.</note> In the first age of the originall Creation, he had his ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant <hi>Enoch,</hi> of whom it is said, <hi>Placuit Deo &amp; translatus est in Paradisum,</hi> hee pleased God and was translated to <note place="margin">Eccl: 44.</note> Paradice. In the second age of vniuersall corruption, he had <hi>Noah</hi> to be the seminarie of the godly, of whom it is said, <hi>factus est reconciliatio.</hi> In the third, which was the peculiar election of the Iewes, he had <hi>Abraham,</hi> of whom it is said, <hi>Et non inventus est similis ei qui conseruaret</hi> 
               <note place="margin">ibid.</note> 
               <hi>legem excelsi.</hi> In the fourth, which was his manifesta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note place="margin">ibid.</note> to be the God of Israel by the written Law, hee had his excellent <hi>Moses,</hi> of whom it is written, <hi>Dilectus Deo &amp; hominibus Moses cuius memoria in benedictione.</hi> In the <note place="margin">Eccl: 45.</note> fist, which was the establishment of the Iewish kingdom, he had his Prophet <hi>Dauid,</hi> whom himselfe did honour with this testimonie, <hi>Inveni hominem secundum cor meum.</hi> In the sixt, which was the propheticall illumination of <note place="margin">1. Kings 16.</note> the Synagogue, among greater numbers, he had in spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall his <hi>Eliah,</hi> of whom it was said, <hi>Et quis potest similiter gloriari tibi.</hi> So in the seuenth, which was the falling of <note place="margin">Eccles. 45.</note> the Synagogue, hee had his great Priest <hi>Simeon Onia,</hi> of whom it is said, <hi>Quasiignis effulgens, &amp; quasithus redolens in igne, quasi vas auri soliduns ornatum lapide pretioso.</hi> Euen so in the later ages since the Gospell, albeit things goe
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:4124:143"/>
not by cleare reuelation from heauen as then, because propheticall actions be all finished, and all Scriptures concluded in our Sauiour, yet by the like effects we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serue one and the same working of God to maintaine the generation of the Iust, for looking vpon these famous Emperours, <hi>Constantinus Magnus,</hi> and <hi>Carolus Magnus,</hi> most deuoute and Christian Princes, they resemble <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> the first whereof eiected the Arrians, as <hi>Dauid</hi> did the Nations. And the last is said to haue set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the first meanes temporall of Christs Church, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they were more able to guard themselues from barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous persecutions, as <hi>Solomon</hi> did build the Temple and house of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Againe in Princely exaltations we doe obserue this, that the Princes who bee called <hi>Flagellum Dei,</hi> and who be so indeed, such as <hi>Nimrod,</hi> said by the spirit of God to be a mighty hunter before the Lord, such as the wicked kings of Israel, such as the persecuting Emperours, such as <hi>Tamberline</hi> the Tartarian, such as the formidable Ottomanicall Princes: These I say, and all such, the Lord God doth suffer to rise vnnaturally, vnlawfully, in furie, a good Prince is a rare Iewel, like vnto the vision of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> where among sixe destroying Angels, he saw but one man who had power of safety, because the sins of men doe merit oftentimes punishments, they come as feare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full tempests in the ayre, which ouerthrow the strongest Oakes and most firme Towers, they come as impetuous inundations to spoyle and destroy, they doe all by vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and nothing can pacifie their rage because they are sent to execute the wrath of God. These Princes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine who come for the solace and safetie of people, sent out in mercie, they rise as it were in the sweetnesse of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, they come in peace and calmenesse, they shoot vp by gentle and lawfull meanes, &amp; from humble begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings they mount in patience to miraculous greatnesse, <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Dauid</hi> from the sheepe, <hi>Nabuc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

Prince misknowing God, oppressing his people <hi>sub virga ferrea,</hi> vnder a scepter of Iron, because he was sent by God in Iustice. <hi>Cyrus</hi> againe a meeke and temperate Prince, whose golden scepter brought comfort with it, because he was directed in mercie: So that it is easie to marke in Kings by their circumstances, what kind of Commissions they bring.</p>
            <p>To come from this general contemplation to an Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothesis, to consider the condition of our most gracious Soueraigne, whom the Lord hath sent in his mercie, to worke pacification and vnity in the hearts of Christian People, to be a Father of Peace, Piety, and Iustice, if we can rightly apprehend it, we shall find great reason to say also <hi>Mirabilis Deus in sanctis suis:</hi> we shall find this bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed age in this Isle to be like vnto that whereof the Lord God did prophesie to <hi>Abraham.</hi> That in the fourth ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration his posteritie should be restored from the bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage of Egypt, so farre, that one may imagine how the growing of this royall Monarch is not vnlike to that of the house of Israel, and how God hath ordained our So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne King for seruices, not vnlike vnto those of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> as I will shortly shew, by conferring these circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces following. First the pouertie, diuision, and constant vexation of this Isle vnder the Scots, the Pichts, the Danes, the Saxons, the Brittaines, the English: doth it not well resemble the Egyptian bondage? Next our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obnoxious to much forraine ambition now practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by Fraunce, now by Spaine, now by Rome; during our Soueraigne his Minoritie, was it not a true seruitude of <hi>Pharaoh?</hi> Lastly our intestine contention for gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both in the Church and state these many yeeres past, before the Lord did exalt his horne, and place him vpon the throne of this stately Monarchie; were they not like the grudgings, and murmurations of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Israel in the wildernesse? The protection of God <note place="margin">Exod. 2.</note> ouer the life of <hi>Moses</hi> was miraculous after his birth, when he was cast into the riuer, and what floods of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:4124:144"/>
did fall out about the Natiuitie of his Maiestie, the Stories of our countrey can record. <hi>Moses</hi> was called from the sheepe to talke with God in mount Horeb, to <note place="margin">Exod. 3.</note> receiue the mysteries of gouernment, and we may say his Maiestie, from humble fields, and dangerous beginnings hath ascended into the top of high gouernment, where the Lord as we see hath inspired him how to settle both Church and state. <hi>Moses</hi> was obstinate against the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and would not discontinue the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his miracles and his instance to haue his people <note place="margin">Exod. 6. 7.</note> dismissed: and let vs sincerely and vprightly ponder what a miraculous constancie was it in his Maiestie, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his going into England, to bee so confident against the opposition of so many <hi>Pharaohs,</hi> who laboured to keepe his Maiestie still in Egypt, how many Spanish, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suiticall and strong machinations did he both contemne and frustrate, which were cunningly vrged before he did possesse that Crowne, and how many, euen of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sties friends and good subiects, did hold his Highnesse both weake and impotent; thinking of his Maiestie that which <hi>Moses</hi> feared should be said of himselfe, Who am I that I should goe to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> That who was his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stie without stronger ayde to purchase so mightie a state. The hoste of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was drowned in the red sea, while they sought to bring <hi>Moses</hi> into Egypt. And did not that proud <hi>Armada</hi> of the Spanish <hi>Pharaoh</hi> perish in his Maiesties seas, and in our eyes, while they intended to detaine him in Egypt? <hi>Moses</hi> was a man most painefull in his long and tedious voyage in the wildernesse, and what were a number of his Maiesties yeeres, but a wande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring in the widernes of our rebellion, &amp; a languishing in the discords of our distemperate stare, as we know; <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> was a man full of mansuetude, patience and affection to his people, notwithstanding their daily murmurati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, whther God hath indued his Maiestie with such quallities, it is easily seene of those who please to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, how many grieuances his Maiestie hath indured of
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:4124:145"/>
some of his insolent subiects, in setling Ciuill and Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasticall Policie, and how many there be in Scotland, who be his Maiesties creatures, <hi>Ex gratia,</hi> holding their liues and estates of his clemencie. <hi>Moses</hi> was a man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished with great wisedome, that God is said to haue taught him the secret Cabbale of vniuersall nature into the mountaine, and how his Maiestie doth meet that part, compared at least with the best knowledge of these times, I haue alreadie giuen you the testimonie of the world, so that it hath no need ofmine: With this consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of his Maiesties person, let vs also weigh aswell how he doth possesse as what he doth possesse in Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and wee shall find indoubtable arguments to say, That the Lord God hath sent him in mercy &amp; loue, by marks which are not to be seene in any Christian Prince in all the world beside; not onely to make of vs a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nation by erecting among vs a vertuous, and a pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous Monarchie, but that he hath destinate him as he hath <hi>Cyrus,</hi> for the restitution of Ierusalem, for the peace and vnitie of his Church.</p>
            <p>The antiquitie of the Crowne of Scotland in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesties house, hath nothing comparable with it in Europe, And his Maiesty hath not bin of late more lawfully, and louingly installed in the state of England by his sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, then the Originall stocke of his royall house King <hi>Fergus</hi> the first was about two thousand yeeres agoe, by our Predecessors called to the Crowne of Scotland, hee did not inuade it, or vsurpe it ouer Princes or people. And as the first Stone of his Maiesties Monarchicall foundation was thus laid naturally, in equitie and vertue, so hath it followed from that pure fountaine to this O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean of lawfull Soueraignty, and grandrue which we see in a righteous line neuer yet interrupted by any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinie, God hath brought to passe in his Maiesties per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son the coniunction of weake and dismembred king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, which neither length of time, nor the industry of watchfull and ambitious Princes, or nature it selfe could
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:4124:145"/>
performe before his comming: that nature was not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, before now to produce that great worke, I proue by the history of <hi>Arthur</hi> King of the Britannes: who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the illegitimate sonne of <hi>Vterpendragon,</hi> was by the force of popular affection aduanced to the Crowne, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wife of <hi>Loth</hi> King of Pichtes, lawfull sister to the said <hi>Vterpendragon,</hi> and before her lawfull sonne <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deret,</hi> which competency after many debates was so transacted, that <hi>Moderet</hi> should succeed King <hi>Arthur;</hi> whereupon both <hi>Loth</hi> and <hi>Moderet,</hi> yeelded great aide to the Brittannes against the Saxons: And yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing in the end, <hi>Arthur</hi> was constrained to declare <hi>Constantine</hi> a Brittan in defraude of <hi>Moderet,</hi> without any pretext of reason, other then neighbour indignation, because the people cryed, <hi>Peregrini sanguinis Regem se nolle,</hi> They would not a stranger in bloud should raigne <note place="margin">Polyd. virg. lib. 8.</note> ouer them: wherein they were so obstinate, that this wrongfull exclusion of <hi>Moderet</hi> was followed with the slaughter of <hi>Arthur</hi> and <hi>Moderet</hi> both in battell, and with the barborous murther of the children of <hi>Moderet,</hi> for the auoyding of strange claimes, as they held it: where we see that nature hath giuen an ouerture of this coniunction, but it could not worke, for <hi>Moderet</hi> was then neerer to the Crowne of England, nor his Maiesty now. To know againe how this Vnion hath beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for and vrged by puissant Kings and all in vaine, we may read the disputation of the royall competents of our Crowne betwixt <hi>Bruce</hi> and the <hi>Baliol,</hi> and the carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of <hi>Edward</hi> the first of England in that processe, and the dealings of the English Kings with King <hi>Dauid Bruce</hi> the time of his restraint there.</p>
            <p>Therefore the case of this great Prince is meerely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, not in fortune, but in Gods disposition. There is nothing in the world which doth so liuely beare the image of God, as a vertuous and temperate Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Monarch: and therefore the Lord doth delight to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presse his power most in such a creature. He who in his

wrath raised <hi>Assur,</hi> and said vnto him, woe bee to thee <hi>Assur</hi> the rod of my fury: I will send thee to a dissem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Nation, that thou mayest tread them vnder thy foot, as mire: hee hath raised this print in clemency and hath said of him, as he did of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> that he should set his people at liberty, both spirituall and temporall within his kingdome. Do we not see what strange chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges the Lord hath already performed by him, as a holy and sanctified instrument. <hi>Gothofred</hi> of <hi>Bullen,</hi> hauing in the siege of Ierusalem, at one blowe cut in two the body of an armed man, and being demanded vpon the miracle of his strength: I carry said he, a hand that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer did touch a whore, meaning it was rather a diuine then a naturall strength. Hath not the world seene in his Maiesty, a constant sanctity in that degree, which hath beene exceeded by none, equalled by few, and hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by the vniuersall admiration of all. For all which foresaid respects hath God rarely blessed his gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and as he hath made this Isle in his happinesse, to be called great, so may she also most iustly be called for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate, wee haue a tradition of the Fortunate Isles, that because of some sacred Nymphes do remaine there, the ground doeth yeeld her fruit without the labour or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dustry of man: What Isle in the world hath yeelded the like faire fruits of vertuous and stately prosperity, and all through being the seat of a sacred and sanctified King: what Isle, or what man hath seene a Prince, <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentem tam opima spolia sine sanguine &amp; sudore,</hi> gathering so rich and costly spoyles without trouble, sweat, or paines. For while the Lord God hath brought to passe in his Maiesty, as wee haue seene things more then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable, yet all hath beene done without noyse or tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult, without violence in any sort, that wee haue per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the Axle-tree of our gouernment changed, but heard no motion in the action: because this great Prince he commeth in peace and mercy, for a blessing and consolation of Gods people, and for the restitution of
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:4124:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his Church. And who will looke into the wayes of his rising, euen through the light of nature and humanity, will thinke that his chiefest fortunes be yet before him. Since the raigne of <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and <hi>Isabell</hi> of Arragon, wee haue seene within few yeeres the house of Spaine, growe vnto a great mountaine of dominion, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of smaller states to conioyne themselues vnto it: wee haue seene how the Isle of France, which doth not exceed one dayes iourney about Paris, it is dilated into a most ample Kingdome, that as the thread of the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish sword, <hi>coelitus pendet,</hi> begins to growe weake by naturall vicissitude, it must bee that the thred of Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanne destiny, beginneth to spinne at length, and that order of the French Crowne, <hi>Immensitremor oceani,</hi> is now so old and worne, that wee begin already to bee masters of the Ocean. And who will search the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Prince supernaturally, shall thinke that God hath appointed him to bee a leader of Christian Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, to step vpon the disordered Theator of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, to make an end of Christian Tragedies, to ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish the contriuers of bloudy Counsels, to set vppe Actors of peace, to perswade, to vrge, and if need be to force generall Councells of the Church. To try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the pretended <hi>Aaron</hi> hath forgotten himselfe and falne to the Idolatry of the golden Calfe, since his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster ascended into the glorious mountaine, and so to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>establish Catholike vnitie.</p>
            <p>These bee the sixe seuerall points wherein doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare, the approach of the reformation of Rome: First, her pride hath already come vnto the Tropicke, from whence it must of necessity turne downe againe: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Christian Princes who bee within her owne bowels, begin to be wearied vnder the pressure of her yoake, two chiefe appearances why the monstrous fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricke of this tyranny is in danger to bee ransacked: Thirdly, you haue heard that the Spaniard, who is the strong <hi>Atlas</hi> that beares vp the same, can aboue any

Christian King, establish the assurednesse of his affaires vpon the ruines thereof. Fourthly, all the orders of the Papall Clergy are bent to ouerthrow the Iesuites, who are the onely cunning craftsmen, who build and vphold this Babilonian tower. Fiftly, the meanes which God seemeth to put into the person of his Maiesty, our gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Soueraigne, to sway the world to peace and vnity in Christian Religion, as well by the weight of his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as by the vertue of his temperate wisedome and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid learning, which hath procured vnto his Maiestie au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, not onely with all Protestant people, but with the best of the Opponents. Sixtly, the absolute credit giuen vnto the primitiue Church, against which there is no side of Christian Clergy that taketh exception. All which things well considered, what I pray you is wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting heere to reforme the holy Church, but these two, <hi>Courage</hi> to vndertake it, and this one word from the mouth of God, <hi>Benedicamus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And seeing the world pointeth at your Maiesty, as the onely man to whom that courage doeth belong, it compelleth mee to turne my speech vnto you, <hi>O great and mighty Monarch:</hi> As they haue seene how God hath made your Maiesty, like <hi>Hereules,</hi> able to ouercome the Gigantine forces of these Kingdomes, dispairefully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuered by inueterate and implacable emulations; pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing your Maiesty in a triumphant Throne, ouer this fortunate Isle, that <hi>Cyrus-</hi>like your Maiesty hath your foot vpon the midst of the hyde, that no side thereof can reuolt, and hath giuen your Maiesty ample domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions without, and that in a miraculous sort, hauing no concurrance of humane helpe, making your Maiesty a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, both the Actor, and the Instrument: Therefore doe they looke that your Maiesty, should in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner cry with <hi>Cyrus, The Lord God of heauen hath giuen me the Kingdomes of the earth, and hath commanded mee to restore Ierusalem,</hi> and to deliuer his people from captiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, because they see how almighty God hath furnished
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:4124:147"/>
your Maiesty with prudence and power, like armed <hi>Pallas</hi> to execute the same: your Maiesty hath hitherto well followed the example of the powerfull <hi>Moses,</hi> in this toilesome gouernment whereunto the Lord hath brought you, but the chiefest praise of <hi>Moses</hi> was his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seuerance, <hi>non coronabitur nisi qui legitime certauerit,</hi> when hee came vp to the mountaine hee was commanded to put off his shooes, to shew plainely that hee might make himselfe light and able to walke, to shew figuratiuely that hee must shake off all fleshly desires and affections which burden our mindes, and pull them downeward from a familiar conuersation with God: O, what a labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious thing it is to come vnto this mount, the vallies bee rich, full of sensuall pleasures, and of easie passage, and therefore they are inhabited of the multitude of the world, the mountaines are steepe and precipitious, and it is hard to clime vp into them, and yet there it is where the Lord hath euer almost shewen himselfe, as mount Sinai, mount Horeb, mount Tabor, mount Oliuet, mount Caluarie, and diuers others declare, to signifie how difficult a thing it is to exalt our selues aboue the sensuality of the world, and how few are worthy to come into the familiar mount of God: onely <hi>Iosuah</hi> was found worthy to ascend with <hi>Moses,</hi> all the rest were comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to remaine at the foote of the mountaine with <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Hur,</hi> which made his charge to bee the greater, for not onely did God command him to come vp, but sayd the Lord, <hi>ascende in montem &amp; esto ibi,</hi> Come vp, and see thou be there, by which words hee would stirre him vp from lazines to think, that he must not only be there, but be watchfull there, as it is sayd, <hi>Non dicitur vemsse qui non steterit:</hi> who standeth straight in the mountaine, he seeth euerie thing which passeth by below him, but to him who wearieth and lieth himselfe down to repose, all the things which are vnder him be hidden, and if the enemies come to spoyle the vallies, he can neuer discouer it.</p>
            <p>As your Maiestie hath beene most watchfull hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto;
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:4124:148"/>
So let your Highnesse thinke that the worke of God doth but begin in you, and that he hath called your Ma: to come vp to the <hi>Mount</hi> not like a fainting <hi>Eliah,</hi> who in his voiage to the mountaine to talke with God, tired, or delighted with the beauty or freshure of the tree, fell asleepe vnder the Ginobre, but like vnto a vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant <hi>Moses</hi> who stood vpright fortie dayes in the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine without refreshment, not like vnto a timorous <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liah</hi> who was afrayd at the voyce of a woman, but still like a couragious <hi>Moses,</hi> who being of his owne nature the most milde among men, yet when he found the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Idolatry of the Calfe at his returning from the Mount, he was enraged, and commanded the Leuites to be armed, and stood in the gates of the Campe till pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment was executed: Let your Maiestie therefore haue watchfull eies to penetrate the latent things of your popular vallies, that no distemper grow among them which may renuerse your Maiesties former cares. Doe specially S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. ouerwatch these two things: First that this lurking <hi>Gangrene</hi> of pretended Puritanisme doe spred no further, nor lie in waite to trouble the settled order of your Maiesties gouernment; But to the end your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iesty and your Royall posterity may euer hit surely in that marke which your Maiestie hath so long shot at, to reestablish into this Isle the primitiue and orthodoxall policie of the Church: Imitate the skilfull Archer by chusing your arrowes of that wood, which is most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for your Maiesties aime, by receiuing into Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall dignities those who bee most religious and sincere, rather the best then the most learned, considering how many men in these daies doe carry Letters as <hi>Uria</hi> did, to cut his owne throat: like vnto those vnhappy Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters who builded an Arke for the safety of <hi>Noah</hi> and his family while they themselues did miserably perish in the flood: Since your Maiestie hath now store of men both of conscience and learning who are resolued enough in the Question of the Church Policy let them see how
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:4124:148"/>
your Maiesty thinketh no man so worthy of the Episco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall chaire as he who commeth vnto it after the sort of that tradition which we haue of <hi>Gregorius Magnus,</hi> who being chosen for his meere vertue, was sayd to flie into the wildeines til he was discerned by a piller of fire which kithed aboue him; Let the light of their learning, their zeale &amp; integtity of their life shining aboue them where they are, be their onely recommendations to Ecclesiasti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call preferment, to the effect that your Maiestie may in that manner stoppe malignant mouthes, and take away all pretext of discontentment or disconformity, from these who say, that your Maiestie doth not preferre the vertuous. So that the treacherous lesuite who like the crafty fish conueyeth himselfe into troubled waters, may want a couert to hide his head, which is the second thing that in all humility I beseech your Maiestie to haue your eyes on, remembring how as the crafty goose who flying along Mount Taurus carrieth a stone in her beake to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine her cry that she bee not heard of the Eagles from the toppe thereof, as I haue told before; So hee can passe by your Maiesty with a closed mouth and masked face, he creepeth into your Maiesties Kingdome as the Serpent did into Paradice, to ouerturne the happinesse thereof.

I will say this, and if it haue no reason. I am content to sing my <hi>Palinodie:</hi> The better and worse condition of things earthly standeth in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison; because there is no perfect condition here, and the trueth of our pleasures and displeasures standeth in the fortitude or weakenesse of our apprehension: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to know surely what a Prince, and what a state wee haue, wee are to remember our selues what may bee in Princes, as they are Prnces, and what also is commonly found in them and in their rule. What may be in a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne King, Looke to the holy Story of Sauls Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Hee shall appoint your sonnes for his Chariots, and for</hi>

miseries while you stood securely on the shore, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helde the troubled Ocean of those tempests, doe not you confesse that those countries haue felt more afflictions in one moneth then wee in all our time; Or if his Maiestie by violent and vnlawfull ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on should bring such armies vpon our neckes, whither would you then make any great reckoning of a light Subsidie, or would you cry that his Maiesty should make a bridge of gold for your enemies to goe forth. Is there any marke of a Prince approued of God, and happie a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men so infallible as to become a great Monarch by iust and peaceable meanes, as to enioy long and introubled tranquilitie; Is there any happinesse compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable with it? Besides the priuate ioyes which peace doth yeeld vnto vs, it is the nourse of good letters, and good policies, and of whatsoeuer is good. As for riches, it is true indeed that the accumulation of treasures is both lawfull and necessarie for Princes, because they are the Gardians of people and states: And <hi>Pecunia est neruus Belli,</hi> but speaking of subiects, remember when great Kings be most mechanicke there the people are most gouerned, <hi>Sub virga ferrea,</hi> whereof we haue seene exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples enough not farre from our coastes. How is it then we should so lightly esteeme two such rare benefits of a constant peace, and of a glorious Monarchie reserued for many yeeres to be the most conspicuous blessing of this age: certainly peace is so heauenly and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry a good, that the spirit of God hath allowed (we know) the Church to pray for Infidell and wicked Princes, that they might haue peace vnder them; seeing our peace then and prosperitie is matchlesse as no man can denie, it is wicked ingratitude in vs that we should not thanke God, and cry, <hi>Quis poterit similiter gloriari nobis,</hi> If it were not that our ignorance doth parly excuse our ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, for how can he valew the sweetnesse of hony, who hath neuertasted of tartnesse, and acerbitie, the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of his yoake, compared with the pride and inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:4124:153"/>
of many great dominators, and the serenitie of his raigne, to speake so, hath bene without any intermission, that how could you know what a thing is the waight and austerity of domination, and if it should not be that our owne follies and euill gouernment should breede vnto vs more discontents and aggrauations then the misgouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the state doth, we were apparantly the most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate subiects vnder the sunne.</p>
            <p>And if any should grudge in the court, I will speake thus farre vnto you, (with humble reuerence, because you are the most excellent Creatures) that of all the grudges which be within the kingdome that is most per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitious, such a malignant and proud spirit, made <hi>Lucifer</hi> to be put to the doore', when the court of Heauen was first established, hee is not worthy to liue at a Princes elbow, who knowes not that as godly and Orthodoxall Kings beare the liuely image of God vpon earth, so their Courts must resemble the seat of God in the heauens, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plenished with innocent Maiestie, vertuous glory, noble and actiue creatures, subiect to perpetuall sympathie and loue, tranquilitie, obedience, and order; you haue the place of the Spheares, which are neerest vnto God.

take sacrety of Gods countenance, the inferiour Planets haue not bodies sufficient to containe the whole splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of the Sunne, yet they are all saciate of light, to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminate their owne spheares. God did vouchsafe vnto <hi>Miriam</hi> a propheticall spirit, but not in that measure as he did to <hi>Moses,</hi> therefore she was strucken with leprosie for her grudging: remember that if the sunne shine of his Maiesties bounty, bee remoued from you for your murmuring, you should bee plagued with a sort of Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosies to desend againe into the inferiour world, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your faces the visible impressions of consuming and contemptible enuy: shall the potsheard say to the Potter, what dost thou make? certainely no: And you who may happen to be principall Planet of the Court, or first moouer of the Courtly spheares, if it should please you to learne the right lesson of your motion in the common schoole of Nature, it should hardly fall forth to you to become an errant Planet: wherfore hath the Lord God made the huge bosom of the great Ocean to be so spacious and receptible of waters, not that shee should acquiesce in her selfe, and bee delighted in the largenesse of her fountaines, but that by secret chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nells shee should continually communicate the vse thereof to those riuers, which bee appointed to water the earth, and as a common seruant in the house of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, render to the Sunne her ordinary moystures, to furnish raine for the fruites of the earth; wherefore hath God planted this glorious Lampe in the Sunne, not that he should pride himselfe in his owne splendour, for that was a Luciferian tricke; but that hee should il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lustrate and beautifie inferiour Planets, and that hee should minister life and light to other creatures: Doeth not your courtly witted <hi>Tacitus</hi> tell you, that euen the best Princes are iealous of Soueraigne points, if any striue to keepe a constant eclipse vpon a Kings face that it may not shine vniuersally, drawing the whole reflexe vpon himselfe, hee saith it is <hi>arcanum imperij</hi> a mystery
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:4124:154"/>
of the Maiesty. It is the fault of <hi>Prothemeus,</hi> to steale the sacred and royall light, to participate of the Maiesty, &amp; becom guilty of a Soueraigne point, it is to eate of the forbidden Tree, seeking to be like vnto God: who as in one Vniuerse, he is only one Center, vnto the which the end of all motions and the glory of all actions doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne: so is a King in one state a only one Center, wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the whole weight and praise of gouernment doth rest. So that you who doe abuse the diuine bounty, which shineth in some rare good Princes, you become (as the same <hi>Tacitus</hi> saith) <hi>Foedum mancipium &amp; malis artibus ambitiosum,</hi> a sordide slaue of Ambition, yee doe snare your selfe into the wicked arts of the same to your ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominious ouerthrow, and to the eternall testimony of royall piety and iustice in him who doth punish you for it. Therefore as his Maiesty<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>, our gracious Soueraigne, hath beene the first happy Prince in the world, by his wise and skilfull creation of those, whom hee hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the chiefe dignities of his fauour, witnessed by their great seruice to the State, of whom many be gone, and numbers yet doe liue through his Maiesties domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions: so let you onely contend among your selues for that Angelicall happinesse, to flye the wicked spirit of proud emulation, that you on the one side may detest that vnnaturall and monstrous enuy of the brethren of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> among the soones of one family, and he on the other, who among his brethren findeth himselfe belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of his father, doe not abuse himselfe with the dreames of <hi>Ioseph,</hi> vnlesse he haue also his propheticall spirit.</p>
            <p>Tis a fearefull thing to consider, how ingrate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious people doe oftentimes constraine good Princes to offend against God, and procure his iudgements, both against their Princes and against themselues, whereof we haue that terrible example of the punishment of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> for the murmuration of Israel at the waters of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, therefore that it should not befall vnto vs as

it did vnto them; that the Lord doe not take from vs our great Captaine: Let vs no more murmure nor grudge, but seeing we see his Oracles haue hitherto been from God, and that the Lord hath said to him as hee said to <hi>Moses, Feare not I shall be with thee,</hi> which our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science wil confesse if we examine our selues, how many times we haue seen the Lord miraculously vpon his side, Let vs with <hi>Zanchius</hi> say, who are we to oppose ourselues against such Lawes, as he hath alredy established, or may heereafter doe by the authority of a setled Church, and well gouerned estate.

Let vs honour this Orient light which doth arise with him after so long eclipse, both in the Church, and in the Common-wealth; that being confirmed and strong by intestine vnion, we may by the force of vnited mindes aspire to that Christian ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be led vnder our excellent <hi>Moses,</hi> or <hi>Ioshua,</hi> to that ioyfull <hi>Iubile,</hi> of the Catholike harmony of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and to eiect those detestable and vile Amala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kites of the Turkish race, that making so our way into the Land of Holinesse, wee may all cry in one voyce as the Prophet foretold of latter times, <hi>Venite ascendamus in montem Domini,</hi> Come brethren let vs ascend together into the mount of the Lord, which is the onely scope of an vpright Christian, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>Now hauing treated thus farre fot the glory of God and edification of his Church, I will craue your pardon who are a discreete Reader to speake two words for the iustification of my voyage to Rome.
