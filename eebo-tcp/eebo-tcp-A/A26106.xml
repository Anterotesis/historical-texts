            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A briefe Relation of all the paſſages
that happened unto us, Captaine Anthony
Weldon, and Captaine Thomas Aſton, in
purſuance of His Majeſties deſigne for
Ireland, ſithens our departure from the
Citie of Briſtoll.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Hrove-monday the 20. of <hi>February</hi> wee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
out of <hi>Briſtoll</hi> with 200. proper men
well armed, and colours flying, and ſhipped
them aboard, in the good Ship called the
Lambe of <hi>Briſtoll.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tueſday the 21. we ſet ſayle from <hi>King-roade,</hi> neare
<hi>Briſtoll,</hi> for <hi>Ireland,</hi> having with us for our Convoy, the
good Ship called the Fellowſhip of <hi>Briſtoll,</hi> a man of
warre. Tueſday night, and Wedneſday all day, we kept
company together at Sea. Wedneſday night the winde
being contrary, ere Thurſday morning our Ship and
Convoy were ſeparated.</p>
            <p>Thurſday about noone we deſcried land, and in the
evening we arrived before the Fort of <hi>Duncannon,</hi> in the
mouth of the River of <hi>Waterford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Friday and Satterday we landed our men ſafely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Fort, wherein we found the noble old Lord <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>
Governour thereof, with 100. men reſident for
the defence thereof; the enemie laying within Musket
ſhot thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:64405:2"/>
The Enemies Commanders under their Generall
the Lord <hi>Mongarret,</hi> are Colonell <hi>Butler,</hi> Lieutenant
Colonell <hi>Maylor,</hi> and Serjeant Major <hi>Butler.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The enemie before our landing had made a Truce or
ceſſation of Armes with his Lordſhip for five dayes,
which was expired the Sunday following our arrivall:
During the time of the Truce, a Parley was fought by
Serjeant Major <hi>Butler;</hi> the effect whereof was, that the
evnemie might be admitted to bring into the Fort as
many men of theirs as his Lordſhip had therein, upon
pretenſe to ſtrengthen the ſame: If this might bee
granted, they would lay downe their armes, but his
Lordſhip would not embrace any of their treacherous
propoſitions.</p>
            <p>At the time of the Parley his Lordſhip demanded
reſtitution for the wrongs and injuries done unto His
Majeſtie, and His Highneſſe Subjects, the poore Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants
in <hi>Ireland;</hi> Anſwer was made by the Enemie,
They could doe nothing in that particular without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
with their Generall.</p>
            <p>Before their firſt Truce was ended, the Enemie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
a ſecond for 14. dayes, but his Lordſhip would
not condeſcend thereunto.</p>
            <p>Munday the laſt of February, Colonell <hi>Butler</hi> ſent
a Letter unto his Lordſhip, perporting a further ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Armes, as alſo a parley with foure of our beſt
men of quality, and then with eight men; and by and
by a Meſſenger ſent from Colonell <hi>Butler,</hi> to deſire
private conference with his Lordſhip in perſon, which
his Lordſhip refuſed; for that he would have no confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
at all with any one of them, without publique
notion to my ſelfe and Captaine <hi>Weldon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:64405:3"/>
Wedneſday the 2. of March, we ſallyed forth upon
the enemies quarters with 60. Musketiers, intending
to have fired their quarters, and bring away ſuch neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
for lodging as we could get, for lodging for our
Souldiers: Our men came bravely on, and exchanged
divers bullets with the enemy; but by extraordinary
numbers of men encreaſing upon us, (being but an
handfull) occaſioned by the ſudden intelligence ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the neighbouring Garriſons, as by burning of Furzes,
ſetting Beacons on fire, &amp;c. we retreated into our Fort
without loſſe of any man, onely one man received a
ſmall hurt in his ſhoulder.</p>
            <p>Friday the 4. of March, we ſallyed forth againe upon
the Enemie, removed their Centinels, forced them to
retreat from their quarters, and brought away their
Court of Guard, made of Deale boards, which ſerved
very well to make our Souldiers Huts, lodging being
ſomewhat ſcarce within the Fort. This day alſo wee
brought our men ſafe off, onely one man ſhot in the
face, but not mortall. This day likewiſe our Convoy,
together with a Pinnace, came into the Harbour.</p>
            <p>Sunday morning the 6. of March we ſallyed forth
againe, intending to have ſome further bandying of bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets
with the Enemie; but marching up their quarters,
we found they had raiſed their ſiedge, and were gone
we knew not whether; of which opportunity wee ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
advantage, preſently fired divers of their houſes,
neare adjoyning unto the Fort, and brought away di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers
ſmall ſtackes of Corne, to our no ſmall comfort,
and then retreated (to give God praiſe) into the Fort,
reſolving to ſally forth againe in the afternoone.</p>
            <p>Sunday in the afternoone we ſallyed forth againe, and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:64405:3"/>
then marched forth with ſome 150. men, about a mile
and halfe diſtant from the Fort, where we fired diverſe
other houſes, there being good ſtore of Corne, Goates,
Sheepe, and Swine; ſome Sheepe, Goats, and Swine
wee brought away, but could not bring any Corne:
Firſt, in regard the day was almoſt ſpent; and ſecond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
for that the Enemie was diſcovered drawing to a
place of ambuſh, that was betweene our men and the
Fort; but ſome of our men remaining behinde in the
Fort, perceiving their drift, prevented their comming;
and preſently ſome 50. Musketiers were commanded
to march thither, and make good the ſame againſt the
Enemie, untill our men ſhould come off, which was
done accordingly; the Enemie not daring to approach
any further, but were forced to retreat with ſhame.</p>
            <p>Sunday night, his Lordſhip, my ſelfe, and Captain
<hi>Weldon</hi> reſolved together with the Captain of the Man
of War, that on Munday morning by the break of
day, the Ship together with the Pinnace, ſhould go up
the River about two miles diſtant from the Fort, and
there lie between a Town called <hi>Paſſage,</hi> and another
ſmall Town called <hi>Ballyhacke,</hi> oppoſite againſt <hi>Paſſage,</hi>
the one having a Fort with four gunnes in it, the other
a ſtrong Caſtle, but no Artillery in it.</p>
            <p>Munday morning the ſeventh of March, I went up
my ſelfe in the Man of War together with the Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,
and lay betweene thoſe two Townes, the Fort
of <hi>Paſſage</hi> ſhot thrice at us, then our Ship ſhot one
ſhot into the Fort, and preſently the Fort hanged forth
a flag of Truce; whereupon, and for that there were
divers of the poor Engliſh Proteſtants Priſoners with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the Town, we made no more ſhots, but wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:64405:4"/>
our battery againſt the Caſtle of <hi>Ballyhacke,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the onely convenient place of Rendevous and Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
for all the rebellious Crue, that beſiege the Fort
of <hi>Duncannon;</hi> our Ship lay before it moſt part of the
day, ſending many ſhots to the Caſtle, but could make
no breach therein, then I commanded ſome 20. Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queties
to go on ſhore, and ſet fire on one ſide of the
Town, which they did landing at one end thereof, where
they ſet a fire one houſe, thinking the reſt of the houſes
on that row would have taken fire by degrees. All this
while the Rebels from the Caſtle played upon our men
with their ſmall ſhot, very thicke; our men retreated
into the Boates, and came aboard againe all ſafe, onely
one man at the firſt landing was ſhot through the
ſhoulder.</p>
            <p>But finding the fire not to take effect, I commanded
the Boates to be manned forth againe, and to land our
men on the other ſide of the Towne, and ſet that on
fire: Our men being landed, marched up very boldly
to the Towne, in deſpight of the Caſtle, (which ſtill
played upon our men with their ſmall ſhot) and fired
the moſt part of the Town, and came off bravely, onely
one other man (one of the Ships company) received
a ſhot into his belly, but none of our men mortally
wounded.</p>
