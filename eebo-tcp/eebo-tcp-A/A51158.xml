            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>I Received your Anſwer to my Letter dated the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April</hi> laſt, and I thank you heartily for your civility. In mine I gave you a ſhort Account of the barbarous Treatment I met with, in a Book Entituled, <hi>A Twofold Vindication of the late Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury, <hi>and of the Author of the Hiſtory of Religion.</hi> I preſum'd to addreſs my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint to your ſelf, becauſe you was pleas'd to prefix an Epiſtle to that Book, in which I am expos'd with greater contempt and ſeverity than I deſerve at your hands.</p>
            <p>I humbly ſuppoſe you proceeded upon the ſame Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes and malicious Informations, that provok'd your two <hi>Anonymous</hi> Authors to ſo much Fury and Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The ground of their quarrel is, that they take it for granted, that I am the Author of a certain Pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet Entituled, <hi>The Charge of Socinianiſm againſt Dr.</hi> Tillotſon <hi>conſidered.</hi> This is the ſecond time that I have been rudely and publickly accus'd on this very Head. I might reaſonably expect, that your <hi>Two Philoſophers</hi> would more narrowly examine the Matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had abus'd an innocent Stranger in ſo ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous a manner; they are ſuch as left me no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to know their Names, or the place of their Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence: Nor am I now at liberty to make a ſtricter ſearch where thoſe Birds of darkneſs may be ſeen. We know without the Aſſiſtance of a Revelation, <hi>that he that doth evil hateth the Light.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:96105:3"/>
The Advertiſement, which I printed in the Month of <hi>January</hi> laſt, in oppoſition to the Cenſures publiſh'd againſt me, upon the foot of that Calumny, might (one may reaſonably think) cover me from all Libels of that Nature, ſince I am ready to take my Oath, before any Judge, that I never had the leaſt thought of writing any ſuch Book, <hi>as the Charge of Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm,</hi> &amp;c. in any former moment of my life: And ſo far from writing any Animadverſions on your <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Religion,</hi> that I never ſaw it until the 16<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1696.</p>
            <p>It may be, that your two Champions will impute this ſecond Vindication to my fear and puſillanimity, and ſay, that I am ſome timorous and ſilly Creature, I dare not now avow what I have fooliſhly done: I am ſo laſh'd, that it is not fit to write any more, to provoke the Anger of ſuch terrible Men, whoſe grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Talent is calumny and impertinence. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, I may venture to tell you, (hoping that your paſſions are more calm,) that I can prove, to a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, by Witneſſes of more unſtain'd Authority and Reputation than any of my Accuſers, that another is the true and ſole Author of that Book: And perhaps he may, in due time, diſcover himſelf, if he can be ſecur'd againſt thoſe Inconveniencies which may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably follow upon his being known. When <hi>your ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry learn'd Authors</hi> conſider this, it may mortifie their accurate Wiſdom, to have thrown away all their Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition of Wit and Raillery before they diſcover'd their Enemy. And now, Sir, I beg your pardon, if I have not the ſame opinion of their <hi>Morals,</hi> that you have of their <hi>Intellectuals.</hi> To rob a Man of his good Name maliciouſly, and without any certainty of matter of <hi>Fact,</hi> can as little be reconcil'd to the Rules of Honour as to the common Meaſures of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:96105:3"/>
The firſt of them endeavours (all he can) to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent me a Beaſt. The next makes me a Devil, tho' one of the weakeſt and ſillieſt Orders. 'Tis happy for the Priſoner at the Bar when the <hi>Evidences</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict one another. However between them two I make a very ſad figure. I am not now to entertain you with my thoughts of their Learning and Theology; they may Write or refute what Books they pleaſe: 'Tis time for me to interpoſe when they medle with any thing that is truly mine. I arrogate to my ſelf no man's performances. As for the the Book, that they ſeem to tear in pieces with ſo much bitterneſs and violence, I only read ſome few pages in it; And the Gentleman who gave me a Copy is ready to take his Oath, that, upon the delivery of the Book, I ſaid to him, that I ſhould never be able to read it to the end, it was printed in ſo ſmall a Character.</p>
            <p>It is not enough for your <hi>two Philoſophers</hi> to fall upon me like Madmen, and to abuſe me for what is contain'd in the Book, but they muſt needs drop ſome Reflections that they think are peculiar either to my Perſon or my Country. If they had confin'd their Libels to the <hi>Subject matter,</hi> I would Judge it no part of my buſineſs to undeceive them: But when they make uſe of <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Critical</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, to prove that I am the Author of ſuch a Book, their Reaſons are ſo ſhort and ſuperficial that I may be allow'd to examine them. The firſt ſays, pag. 33. that I was <hi>not able to keep my own Secret, but that it got abroad among a great many,</hi> that I was the Man, <hi>that thought my ſelf qualified to cenſure the Doctrine of an Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury, and <hi>to encounter with the great Author of the Hiſtory of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:96105:4"/>
This is impudence with a witneſs. Did I ſay ſo to himſelf, or to any other Trifling Calumniator? Is it not reaſonable for him to let me know who this Gentleman is to whom I ſaid any thing of this Nature? But this fair and ingenuous Dealing is not his way; it is enough for him that he was inform'd by ſome little Whiſperer that I was the Author of ſuch a Book. And <hi>your Philoſopher</hi> thought this a ſufficient proof; he was glad any Man was nam'd, on whom he might ſo ſafely diſcharge his fury. But when he found it was ſome <hi>tame Illiterate Pedant,</hi> then he puts himſelf all in Armour, as all Cowards do, where there is no danger. If I confeſs'd the matter of <hi>fact</hi> my ſelf it is in vain to contradict it. In the mean time I preſume to tell you, that whether he ſpoke this of himſelf, or whether he was prompted by others, that he is in the Stricteſt ſenſe a Calumniator and a Liar. I confeſs theſe words are harſh, and are not ordinarily heard in the Converſation of Gentlemen. But if any thing can provoke this Impertinent Accuſer to do himſelf Juſtice, I think it may warm him into ſome generous behaviour, to be ſo repreſented to his Great Patron. If he patiently endure the Character of a Liar, I do not envy him the honour of his invention; if not, he will let me know who was his Informer, as in juſtice and common ſenſe he is oblig'd to do. And this is not anſwer'd by Writing of Pamphlets, and gathering together ſeveral incoherent Stories and Probabilities, but by an ingenuous acknowledgment of his willfull and unaccountable Forgery; for when he re-examines his <hi>Evidence,</hi> he will diſcover his own Precipitation and raſhneſs. I gave occaſion to no ſuch Calumny, no not by the leaſt inadvertence or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretion: And it is very hard to oblige me at this
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:96105:4"/>
time of day to the Drudgery of Vindicating my ſelf from Infamous Libels.</p>
            <p>You ſay in your Preface, that they are <hi>two very Learned Men.</hi> Men may be <hi>mad</hi> without <hi>too much Learning:</hi> I wiſh their civility and good breeding had been equal to their Learning. Nor is it a pin matter to me how Learn'd they are: I am ſure they are very Impertinent to Libel a Man, upon the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Theatre of the Nation, to whom they are as great Strangers in all Regards (either as to his life or accompliſhments) as I am to the Emperor of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>However, as far as I am concern'd, it is needleſs to baulk any of their <hi>Arguments.</hi> The queſtion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween me and your <hi>two very Learn'd Gentlemen</hi> is not any Common Place of <hi>Theology,</hi> but a matter of <hi>fact.</hi> I let paſs all their Virulent Reproaches, that ſeem to be occaſioned by the Book that they undertake to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute.</p>
            <p>The firſt <hi>Argument</hi> to prove me the Author of it is, <hi>that I did not keep my own Secret.</hi> Of this you very kindly put me in mind in your Letter, dated the <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>April.</hi> But how does he prove this? Very well, after his way; He ſays, that it got abroad among many People, that <hi>I thought my ſelf qualified for ſuch an Undertaking.</hi> Does it become a Man that ſets up for an Accurate Philoſopher to proceed upon <hi>Whiſper, Hear-ſay,</hi> and <hi>Surmiſe,</hi> to the ruine of his Neighbour's <hi>honour</hi> and <hi>reputation.</hi> Was not he obliged to give the World a plain account of the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>honeſty</hi> of <hi>him,</hi> upon whoſe teſtimony he built his <hi>Defamatory Libel.</hi> He muſt needs know, that a Malicious inconſiderate Liar ſets thouſands of People by the Ears every moment, eſpecially ſuch Informers
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:96105:5"/>
as may be reaſonably ſuppoſed our two Authors have converſed with. They heard ſuch a thing, and there was no more neceſſary in their opinion to make one the Author of ſuch a Pamphlet. But if a Report of this nature can bear the Superſtructure of ſuch a calumny, Men might have nothing elſe to do than to Write <hi>Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations;</hi> they muſt run from one corner to another, without intermiſſion, to publiſh their Defences and Apologies againſt every Rude and Impertinent Libel.</p>
            <p>The Philoſophers adviſe us to be ſlow and wary in Drawing Conſequences; yet, it ſeems, they have loſt all their pains upon your <hi>two</hi> Precipitate <hi>Authors.</hi> We ought to treat no Man otherwiſe than the Golden Rule of our Bleſſed Saviour allows; <hi>Quod tibi fieri non vis,</hi> &amp;c. There is nothing ſo Treacherous or fails a Man ſooner than a tranſient Whifling report;</p>
            <q>Tam ficti pravique tenax quam Nuncia Veri.</q>
            <p>But perhaps the next <hi>Argument</hi> is more <hi>Concluſive</hi> and <hi>Solid. He is very ſure the Author is a Scot,</hi> becauſe for <hi>poſitive he always Writes poſſitive.</hi> To this he adds ſome Elegencies, or rather Improprieties that he thinks are peculiar to the Scots, <hi>viz. The Men above-told, the Reaſon above-told.</hi> And again; <hi>it makes all my fleſh to creep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe he concludes the Author not only to be <hi>Scot,</hi> but a Highlander. Now, upon ſuppoſition that theſe were <hi>Idioms</hi> of the <hi>Scotiſh</hi> Dialect, his ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous conjecture would ſcarcely make up a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Argument, if there was but one Scots-man in the Iſle of <hi>Britain:</hi> But when there are ſo many thouſands of them, his gueſſes vaniſh into a Dream, and proves that there are greater flaws in his reaſoning

            <p>Let our <hi>very learn'd</hi> Philoſophers view his own Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument again; he may eaſily find he hath not been ſo ſlow and cautious in drawing his Conſequences as he ought to be. Are there not ſome <hi>Engliſh-men,</hi> that, for reaſons beſt known to themſelves, <hi>now</hi> and <hi>then</hi> make uſe of <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Phraſes? If any of theſe ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions hold true, his <hi>Argument,</hi> to prove me the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſuch a Book, is the moſt precarious, weak, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherent Conjecture that ever dropt from a Man's Pen.</p>
            <p>But, Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> I have more to ſay to this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is this; that one of your Authors takes thoſe words to be <hi>Idioms</hi> of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Dialect, which no <hi>Scotch-man</hi> ever heard of: For my part, neither in their Writings nor Converſation did I ever remark any ſuch Phraſes, as he ſets down for Arguments, to prove his Author to be a <hi>Scotch-man;</hi> ſuch as theſe, <hi>the Man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove told, the reaſon above told.</hi> And the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language, is not in thoſe imaginary <hi>Improprieties,</hi> that he fancies may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:96105:6"/>
the firſt from the laſt, but rather in this, that We of <hi>Scotland,</hi> (beſides a different Accent) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a great many of the Old <hi>Saxon</hi> words, which are not now us'd in <hi>England:</hi> But they that underſtand the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language accurately, underſtand alſo thoſe <hi>Saxon</hi> words, ſome of which may be met with, in the Old Verſion of the Pſalms, daily read in the Churches. And if he be ſo ſqueamiſh as not to read that Verſion of the Pſalms; he may read <hi>Milton</hi>'s Poems, and <hi>Chau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer</hi>'s Works, where he may ſee many of thoſe words that diſtinguiſh the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Idiom, from that which is now us'd in <hi>England.</hi> The difference is not to the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing of words, but in the Phraſe it ſelf, the firſt may proceed from the inadvertence of an Author, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Scottiſh</hi> or <hi>Engliſh:</hi> And it is a very bad Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to prove that the Author of ſuch a Book is not an <hi>Engliſh-man,</hi> if I meet with an unuſual word, or an <hi>impropriety</hi> in his compoſitions. There is no fixt true <hi>Standard</hi> for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Language, and therefore eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day we ſee new Words, as new Books do appear; and ſeveral of them ſo harſh in the ſound, and ſo little us'd, that immediately they vaniſh unto their former darkneſs and ſolitude. Thus have I read in a late Book the word <hi>(impunibly)</hi> (and in a Book written againſt Myſteries too.) But I ſuppoſe no Man will reaſonably conclude, that the Author was either <hi>Scot</hi> or <hi>Engliſh,</hi> only from this unuſual word.</p>
            <p>To come a little nearer: If I might venture to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as <hi>your Philoſophers</hi> ſeems to do, I would prove that the Author of the <hi>Hiſtory of Religion</hi> is not an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh-man;</hi> for in the 96<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Page, I meet with a word which very few <hi>Engliſh-men</hi> know or ever heard; for there the Author ſays, that the <hi>miſtakes and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which proceed from innocence</hi> do not make Men
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:96105:6"/>
guilty, that is to ſay, from their <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How much <hi>weakneſs</hi> and <hi>ignorance</hi> there may be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd in the word <hi>(innocence)</hi> I cannot tell; it may have in it all the Myſteries of <note n="*" place="margin">Vid. <hi>Seld. de Diſ. Syris.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Abraca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dabra,</hi> for any thing I know; for I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read it before. Nor do I admire the word <hi>(Imperſonation)</hi> in the Author of the <hi>Charge of Socinianiſm,</hi> no more than I do the word <hi>(Innocence)</hi> both of them want Authority and Cuſtom, to preſerve them from being baniſh'd out of ordinary Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Perhaps your Author built his Confidence, not ſo much upon the ſtrength of his critical Remarks, as up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Authority of his Informer; yet, to mortifie him and his cholerick Neighbour; I may be allow'd to tell you, that the Author of the Book, Entituled, <hi>The Charge of Socinianiſm</hi> againſt Dr. <hi>Tillotſon,</hi> was never in <hi>Scotland;</hi> ſo far from being beyond the River of <hi>Tay,</hi> that he never was on the other ſide of <hi>Tweed,</hi> nor any City or Village in that Ancient Kingdom.</p>
            <p>One of your Authors tells us, (ſpeaking of Mr. <hi>At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury)</hi> that <hi>Students do not hold themſelves oblig'd to reaſon accurately and cloſely, as other (common) Men muſt, but, by leaping over ſome intervening ſuitable Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, may skip from Tumult to King</hi> Pipin; <hi>or, what <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>One would think, that the diſtance between an <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Phraſe,</hi> and a <hi>Scotch-Highland,</hi> is as wide as that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Tumult</hi> and <hi>King Pipin;</hi> or that between an <hi>Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian</hi> and a <hi>Scorner.</hi> I ſee, that <hi>Students</hi> are not the only Men that reaſon <hi>looſely,</hi> and <hi>incoherently;</hi> there are other <hi>Sparks</hi> who pretend to digeſt nothing but <hi>Self-evident Propoſitions,</hi> and accurate Infallible Dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions

            <p>His obſervation that <hi>the fleſh of a Highlander creeps,</hi> is as <hi>New</hi> to me as the <hi>Phraſe:</hi> I am ſure, there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of them, that he thus Lampoons, would be very apt to make <hi>his</hi> Fleſh tremble, if they knew him, and that withal he continued obſtinate in his ſcurrilous rudeneſs.

            <p>Yet, this very ſagacious <hi>Philoſopher;</hi> this very Man of <hi>Evidence</hi> and <hi>Demonſtration,</hi> without any other proof, than a <hi>ſlender</hi> Whiſper or an <hi>Impudent</hi> lye, finds out <hi>all Authors,</hi> and knows them exactly, as if he had been converſant with them from their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy.

            <p>The next Author treats me with the ſame virulence and contempt that the former does; but he may appear, even to himſelf, a very ridiculous Fellow, that, with ſo much wit, undertakes the defence of ſuch particular Propoſitions as I my ſelf lately proved (I hope plainly enough) againſt another tribe very different from the <hi>Socinianiſm,</hi> in a ſmall Treatiſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>An Enquiry into the New Opinions,</hi> Printed for <hi>Walter Kettilby</hi> at the <hi>Biſhop's-head</hi> in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Church-yard.</hi> And this Book appeared, with my name, a conſiderable time before his ſcurrilous Libel was Printed. I inſtance but in one particular, which I advance in that <hi>Eſſay,</hi> and it is this; that our <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour</hi> complied with thoſe <hi>Rituals</hi> in the Worſhip of God among the <hi>Jews,</hi> which had their <hi>Riſe</hi> and <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal</hi> only from human <hi>Authority:</hi> Nay, I think the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Doctrine, that allows of nothing in the Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of Worſhip, but what is founded upon <hi>expreſs</hi> Divine <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> to be the ſource of all <hi>Bigottry</hi> and Enthuſiaſm. God is to be Worſhiped, and <hi>that</hi> in Unity and Society. If this be allowed, ſeveral <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> must be Practis'd and enjoin'd, which have no Inſtitution but in the Prudence and determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of our Superiours. If the angry Gentleman read this little Book that I have named, he may <hi>then</hi> be more able to paſs his <hi>Decretory</hi> Sentence, how far the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible Profeſſor is of <hi>Mr. Knox</hi>'s Principles. He
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:96105:8"/>
or his Neighbour, (I do not now remember which of the two) not only laſhes me as being tainted with thoſe Principles of Sedition and Confuſion, that were ſo warmly Propagated by <hi>Mr. Knox,</hi> but he ſays, that all the Epiſcopal Clergy of <hi>Scotland,</hi> tho' they forſook Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> and Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> in the queſtion about Church Government, yet, in points of Doctrine, they have varied nothing at all from <hi>Mr. Knox</hi> Author of the Reformation there.</p>
            <p>If this Man's knowledge in <hi>Theology</hi> was equal to his skill in our <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> he would certainly make the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt figure that ever appear'd, that is to ſay, he would be all over <hi>Innocence</hi> in its true <hi>Original</hi> and <hi>Inſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant Notion,</hi> ſo much below a <hi>Cypher</hi> that there is no Room left for him in <hi>Arithmetick.</hi> Therefore he may be adviſed to let the Clergy of <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>their</hi> Doctrine alone; they are not yet ſo low, after all the oppreſſions and <hi>contradictions of ſinners</hi> that they have endured, as to want an Apology againſt the <hi>Railings</hi> of an inconſiderate Calumniator, who knows as little the Perſons, that he thus beſpatters, as he does the Author of the <hi>Charge of Socinianiſm, &amp;c.</hi> Let him read Dr. <hi>Forbes</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Edinbourg</hi> his <hi>Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derationes Modeſtes,</hi> and then let him tell me whether he was in all points of Doctrine of Mr. <hi>Calvin</hi> or Mr. <hi>Knox</hi>'s Sentiments: And <hi>he</hi> was a Perſon whoſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter and Learning was more likely to make Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples amongſt the Clergy of <hi>Scotland,</hi> than the two Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers that he is pleaſed to name. Nevertheleſs, <hi>Calvin</hi> ought to be mention'd with honour, becauſe of the purity of his ſtile, and other extraordinary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments.</p>
            <p>Some of our Clergy may have their differences amongſt themſelves about the Doctrine of <hi>Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>

and <hi>Freewill,</hi> but then this is no reproach peculiar to <hi>Scotland;</hi> theſe are <hi>Common Places</hi> in <hi>Divinity</hi> that divide (not Churches from Churches but) Men from Men. Thoſe queſtions have been diſputed in all Ages, and will remain dark to the end of the World, even to the <hi>Socinians</hi> themſelves, who pretend to baniſh all <hi>myſteries.</hi> I believe the Infinite Incomprehenſible Power of God, and that he is the firſt cauſe of all things; in <hi>him we live, move, and have our Being.</hi> I believe him alſo <hi>infinitely</hi> Good, and that he loves us better than we can do ourſelves, and that he governs the World by Laws juſt, holy, and excellent. I Worſhip him under this <hi>Idea</hi> of Original Goodneſs and Power; and I am very ſure, that none of the <hi>true</hi> and <hi>neceſſary deductions,</hi> from <hi>theſe</hi> two great <hi>Attributes,</hi> can be at variance with one another. If I, (who am but Duſt and Aſhes,) neither can ſee, nor happily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain their agreement in all <hi>Minute</hi> inſtances, it is my Ignorance and Weakneſs. The Good I do is from God, the Evil altogether from my ſelf: And this is a ſhort Confeſſion of what I think all Men ought to adhere to, in thoſe Intricate and abſtruſe queſtions of <hi>Predeſtination</hi> and <hi>Freewill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not now inclin'd to enter into any particular diſquiſition concerning the Original of Sacrifices; nor had I ever the leaſt thought of writing Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions on any Sermons Publiſh'd by the Late Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop <hi>Tillotſon;</hi> moſt of them as were Printed before the Revolution I read with great ſatisfaction; and thoſe that ſince appear'd I only read ſome of them, as I met with them accidentally in the Bookſellers-ſhops, being not in an humour to buy New Books, when I knew not how long I could keep ſuch as I had formerly purchaſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:96105:9"/>
Then your Philoſopher recommends to me that I ſhould read <hi>Spencer</hi> and <hi>Outram.</hi> I love him the better that he converſes with ſuch Authors, who are as much above the <hi>Common Level</hi> of <hi>Syſtematick</hi> Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as <hi>their</hi> Learning exceeds <hi>his own</hi> modeſty and good nature.</p>
            <p>The former Author draws a Picture of me in little. I am not concern'd much to view it, tho' the <hi>Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> and <hi>Features</hi> had been more true: but as they are extreamly ugly and extravagantly falſe, he may lay it up in his own Cloſet, to entertain himſelf with it, when he is in his <hi>Hypochondriack</hi> fits. The firſt ſtroaks of his <hi>Tableau</hi> are Hiſtorical, and terminate only in my Perſon, and ſuch as the Author <hi>of the Charge of Socinianiſm is</hi> not at all concern'd in. In the mean time, I think my ſelf oblig'd to give him no account of any part of my life, unleſs I knew him better: And if I did, perhaps I might ſtill continue in the ſame reſolution. He accuſes me to have <hi>charged the late Archbiſhop of</hi> Canterbury, and <hi>the Biſhop of</hi> Sarum, and <hi>the Author of the Hiſtory of Religion of Socinianiſm:</hi> And he adds this moſt accurate Reaſon, <hi>becauſe I miſtake the Doctrine of the Church and the Arguments ſhe uſeth for the Socinian Doctrine and Reaſons.</hi>

            <p>Whether any of thoſe Gentlemen now named were, or are <hi>Socinians,</hi> is more than ever I intend to enquire. It is a very new thing to me to hear that <hi>the Church uſeth Arguments for the Socinian Doctrine and Reaſons.</hi>

            <p>It is true; one of his eminent Authors accuſed me of being the Author of <hi>the Charge of Socinianiſm,</hi> in the Month of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi>

            <p>But one of the moſt ſurpriſing and impertinent ſtroaks of your Author's Libel is, that he charges me to have <hi>accuſed</hi> your ſelf of <hi>ingratitude to K.

               <hi>Arbitrary Power</hi> is moſt frequently declaimed againſt by ſuch as are inveſted with no Power: But it is very hard to oblige the <hi>Soveraign Powers</hi> of the World to give an account of all their Actions; and if they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:96105:11"/>
did, the Body of the People can never perceive the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs of what they do, even when their meaſures are moſt Divine and unqueſtionably juſt. If I ſhould ſay that I know no reaſon why I am committed to the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> I would be thought very Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, tho' I ſhould ſtumble upon the truth. No Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernors are oblig'd to let every body know what they do at all times.</p>
            <p>If there are myſteries in the Government of the World, it may be more reaſonably preſum'd that that there myſteries in Religion which we ought to believe, tho' we can never fully graſp nor compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them. When Men have done their beſt, there is ſome thing dark in the object of Faith. If we have good reaſon to believe, that the Revelation, which contains the Articles of our Religion, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds originally from God, and that we do not miſtake the plain ſignification of thoſe Words, in which it is convey'd, we may, with the greater ſafety, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that <hi>ſuch</hi> and <hi>ſuch</hi> Propoſitions are true, tho' they be above the <hi>comprehenſion</hi> of our Reaſon. We cannot ſay, that we fully underſtand the <hi>Eſſence</hi> of any the leaſt <hi>Created</hi> being, far leſs the <hi>Infinite</hi> and <hi>Eternal</hi> Mind, who made the World and governs it. We believe, that his power is beyond our thoughts and <hi>Incomprehenſible;</hi> but can any Man confidently ſay, that he himſelf has a full and <hi>adequate Idea</hi> of what is <hi>Infinite</hi> or <hi>Incomprehenſible?</hi>

            <p>Sir, I have kept you too long on this ſubject. I would humbly intreat either or both of the two Calumniators to be a little more wary in their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels. 'Tis an eaſy thing for them to put it to a fair Trial whether I can read <hi>Greek</hi> or <hi>Latin,</hi> or whether <hi>either</hi> of them can Speak any other Language than
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:96105:11"/>
what his Mother taught him. As for the reflexions thrown upon the Univerſities of <hi>Scotland,</hi> thoſe So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties are above the Cenſures of an unknown Trifler; his <hi>tongue is an Unruly Evil, it is full of Deadly Poiſon.</hi> I cannot tell how <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Jam.</hi> 3. <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. 8. 9.</note> oft he <hi>bleſſes God</hi> with it; his greateſt talent <hi>is to curſe Men made after the Similitude of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>One of them recommends to me two very good Books; and I thank him for his kindneſs. I think, he himſelf had need to read over again <hi>Crellius Ethicks;</hi> And if that be troubleſome, he may caſt his eye upon a moſt excellent Sermon againſt <hi>Evil-ſpeaking,</hi> Publiſhed by one <hi>of his eminent Authors.</hi> And now, Sir, your two Philoſophers may ask one another, whether they know the Perſon they have ſo impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently Calumniated? Whether the Authority they proceeded upon be ſo firm as to bear the weight of their notorious Forgeries and Lies? Whether ever they heard that there was any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor in any Univerſity of <hi>Scotland</hi> at any time, ſince their firſt foundation, ſo ignorant as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent me to be. But if they built their Calumnious ſtories upon the Authority of one of their <hi>Eminent Biſhops,</hi> I may be allow'd to tell them, that I was already at ſome pains, in the Month of <hi>January</hi> laſt, to undeceive their Author as to this Calumny. Then there was a Libel Publiſhed againſt me; and it ſeems it was below his <hi>Eminence</hi> to retract an injury he had done to ſo mean a Perſon. It is much more eaſy eloquently to extol the <hi>Morals</hi> of Chriſtianity, than to practiſe ſelf-denial and humility: Pride, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Applauſe, and Vanity do animate Men to the firſt; but nothing ſhort of a profound Reſignation
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:96105:12"/>
to the will of our Bleſſed Saviour can terrible us to practiſe the latter.</p>
            <p>I take it for granted that my greateſt Accuſer is now convinced, that I never wrote any ſuch Book as <hi>the Charge of Socinianiſm, &amp;c.</hi>] Yet becauſe the ſame Libel is again Propagated by the induſtry and malice of two unknown Slanderers, I think it fit to ſubjoin to this Letter the Advertiſement, that I was forced, (ſome Months ago in to Publiſh in my own Defence: And he that reads the Biſhop's Vindication, Printed for <note place="margin">

There are ſome words in it which might have been ſpar'd, but if compar'd with the Character beſtow'd upon me, perhaps many more might have been added, without any Conſure from the Impartial World. If the open injuſtice, that I met with, made me <hi>then</hi> ſo free, the peeviſhneſs, which may be occaſioned by impriſonment, may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the Reprinting of it, ſince the Loads of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach thrown upon me, by <hi>your two ſcurrilous Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions,</hi> are but ſome Larger Annotations on the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Character, in which I was <hi>then</hi> repreſented in ſuch taking colours to the view of the Nation.</p>
            <p>Sir, I now make an end of this Letter, and I preſume to ask but the ſame queſtion that I humbly deſired you formerly to conſider, namely, what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations you think are due to an innocent Stranger ſo unworthily abuſed. I forbear to aggravate the Injuſtice that is done to me in your Preface, as well as in the other parts of the Book, for I believe you wrote it careleſly, and you thought that <hi>your</hi> two <hi>Hereos</hi> were as infallible in their cenſures, as they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd

            <argument>
               <p>THE following Advertiſement was Printed in the Month of <hi>January</hi> laſt, to undeceive ſuch as might be impos'd upon by thoſe Libels which <hi>then</hi> charg'd me with the ſame Calumny that is now ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently remov'd by this Letter.</p>
            </argument>
            <head>AN ADVERTISEMENT By <hi>A. M.</hi> D. D.</head>
            <p>WHereas it hath been talked by ſome idle and impertinent People, that I am the Author of a certain Book, entituled, <hi>The Charge of Socinia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm againſt Doctor.</hi> Tillotſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I think it fit to declare, that I never was the Author of any ſuch Book, charging him or any other with <hi>Socinianiſm.</hi> And I further declare, That I was never enticed, prompted, or encouraged by any Man (dead or alive)
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:96105:13"/>
to write any thing of <hi>that</hi> nature. And I am ready to take my Oath, in the moſt ſolemn manner, to confirm the truth of all this, if duly required thereunto.</p>
            <p>When I have ſaid ſo much, I think I am but little concerned to anſwer any Libel intended againſt me upon this occaſion, in which I am ſenſibly ſtruck at, by ſome diſtinguiſhing <hi>innuendo's,</hi> (tho' not particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly named,) as the Vindicator himſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. The ſeveral reflections, in a ſhort digreſſion of a late Book, levelled at me, are but ſome common places of Reviling, which only proves, That the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was very angry. One may venture to draw this Conſequence from what is ſaid <hi>Page</hi> 105. and 106. of his Vindication, without the imputation of either <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Malice.</hi> No modeſt Man loves to be put upon the unpleaſant Task of defending himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Reproaches of this Nature. It is barbarous to invade a Man's good Name, upon ſlender and fooliſh Surmiſes. The Rules of Humanity oblige us to more Compaſſion and good Nature: But moſt Men had rather talk of Generoſity than practiſe it. If we truly underſtood the Precepts of Natural Religion, we would be the more prepared heartily to believe that which is Revealed.</p>
            <p>It is a great Infelicity to continue for any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time, under the dominion of a brutal Paſſion: And it is very difficult to hide it, where once it hath got the <hi>Aſcendant.</hi> Art and Memory may give a Man the ſlip, and Nature will appear in its own Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. It is uneaſie to act a Part, even when we are much accuſtom'd to it. I thank God, I was never made a Tool to ſerve the Paſſions or Intereſts of any particular Man or Party: I ſtill retain the liberty of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:96105:13"/>
my Thoughts and Actions under all my Diſaſters. If I am oblig'd to my Friends, I am reſolv'd to be Grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: I am very ſure, none of them gave my Enemies any Commiſſion to upbraid me with <hi>their</hi> kindneſſes. <hi>Cruel Mockings</hi> do ordinarily attend the State of the Oppreſs'd: And Philoſophy, as well as Juſtice has deſerted the Earth. What St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath ſaid of the Primitive Chriſtians is, in a peculiar manner, true of the Clergy of <hi>Scotland,</hi> if there be not another Life, <hi>They are of all Men the moſt miſerable.</hi> I pray God they may poſſeſs their Souls in patience.</p>
            <p>For my part, I love my Solitude and Retirement; and the oldeſt Books in Divinity better than all the later Eſſays and Explications. When <hi>my Eccleſiaſtical Superiors</hi> inform me, That my endeavours to ſerve the <hi>Church,</hi> are impertinent or unſeaſonable, I chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſubmit to their Authority, as I have always done, <gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>n <hi>their</hi> and my) more proſperous Circumſtances.</p>
            <p>What is obſerv'd by my Accuſer is certainly true, <hi>viz. That ſome Men have an Art of Writing to diſparage the ſide they write for.</hi> For this very reaſon, ſome haſty Productions have been committed to the Flames; and others, which perhaps deſerve the ſame Illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, are ſuppreſs'd.</p>
            <p>If he had left me half dead under the Cloud of general Strictures, there might be ſome hopes of a Reſurrection; but he thought it convenient to ſet me in a better Light: I muſt be ferreted from one <hi>Dominutive</hi> unto another, until the Multitude fix their Eyes upon me. A Triumphal Arch muſt be rais'd, where ſuch a contemptible Creature was ſlain; and therefore he adds, <hi>That it is probable, the Party will deſire their Journey-man to forbear writing, and</hi>

            </p>
            <p>One that reads this laſt ſtroak may be made to believe, that ſome time or other I have fall'n into Quarrels and Contentions, very unbecoming a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sbyter, whereas the true ſtory, that is thus diſguis'd into an Invective, is no more, than that I was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by a Relation of mine (then Lieutenant-Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel to my Lord <hi>Dumbarton</hi>'s Regiment) when I was very Young, to go abroad with him: I complied with his Invitation: I ſtayed in <hi>France</hi> about two Years and a half: And tho' I was Liſted in that Regiment, I was under no reſtraints that might divert me from any part of Learning that I had a mind to: That <hi>Scene</hi> was quickly over; I return'd to my <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

            <p>To have been a Souldier, is a Reproach only in the Opinion of ſome few Men, who underſtand Libelling better than the diſcipline of War. The Greateſt in all Ages thought, that, the Liberal Sciences, and the knowledge of Arms are not at ſuch odds with one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> (to name no more) were Soldiers. The truth is, I am not ambitious of being call'd a <hi>Journey-man:</hi> And I am ſurpris'd to find ſo mean a World placed ſo near another, that is ſo <hi>uſual</hi> and ſo <hi>manly.</hi> Some Men forget nothing but the <hi>Decorum</hi> due to their Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter: It is fitter for ſuch to give hard Names, than for me to return an Anſwer. Notwithſtanding of all this, I thank God, I was never obliged nor inclined
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:96105:14"/>
to Fight, nor yet engaged in any <hi>Rencontre</hi> that could make me incapable to ſerve at the Altar.</p>
            <p>It is no part of my buſineſs to know or enquire what Books are written againſt my Accuſer or any of his Friends and Acquaintance dead or alive. I think it very hard to publiſh ſcandalous Reports againſt a Presbyter, before he is either heard or examined. The Laws of Nature and Nations condemn this practice: And the Evangelical Canon requires, that <hi>no Accuſation ought to be received againſt an Elder, but before two or three Witneſſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Clandeſtine Libels are more Malicious than when a Man is particularly named. It is a ſad Misfortune to be made the Property of every little Intelligencer. If groundleſs Stories, and unexamin'd Falſhoods are publiſh'd for Truths, what then comes of the Peace of Human Societies? I pray God convince all Men, that are engaged in ſuch Deſigns, of their Error and Injuſtice; and in the mean time deliver me from the Malice of ſuch as I never provoked.</p>
