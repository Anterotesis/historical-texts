            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

perſon <hi>Peter Des Cartes</hi> Grandfather to the
Philoſopher whoſe Life we are here about to
undertake to write.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Peter Des Cartes,</hi> after having with good
ſucceſs ſerved in the War againſt the Enemies
of the Religion of his Countrey, and againſt
thoſe of the ſtate of his Prince, quitted the
ſervice pretty early, on purpoſe that he might
the longer reliſh the fruits of repoſe, that he
procured himſelf; he had no more but one
Son of <hi>Claudia Ferrand</hi> Siſter to <hi>Anthony Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand,</hi>
principal Lieutenant particular of the
<hi>Chaſtelet</hi> of <hi>Paris;</hi> and Siſter to <hi>Michael Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand</hi>
who was Father to <hi>M. Ferrand</hi> Dean of
Parliament.</p>
            <p>This Son by name <hi>Joachim</hi> was the firſt of
the Family who was of the Long Robe or fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Law, who went to ſettle in <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taigne,</hi>

who was born at <hi>La Haye,</hi> or the
<hi>Hague</hi> in <hi>Turaine</hi> upon the River of <hi>Creuſe</hi> on
the <hi>31th</hi> day of <hi>March,</hi> in the year 1596. in
the ſeventh year of <hi>Henry</hi> the Great or <hi>Hen.</hi> 4.
in the beginning of the fifth year of the Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificat
of <hi>Clement</hi> the eighth, He ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
very ill ſatisfied in the courſe of his Life,
afterward, that any one ſhould take notice of
his Birth-day from the Baptiſmal Regiſter of
the Pariſh, and from the Genialogical Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chives,
or Pedigree of his Family; his Reaſon
was, becauſe <hi>He had a great averſion to your
Calculaters of Nativity, whoſe errour one ſeems
to promote when he publiſheth the Birth of any one.</hi>
But it is not ſo much a reaſon as a pretence
which he alledged to thoſe who were willing
to make uſe of this Circumſtance to make
him known to the publick.</p>
            <p>III.<note place="margin">His Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</note> He received Baptiſm the third day of
<hi>April</hi> enſuing in the Parochial Church of St.
<hi>George</hi> of <hi>La Haye,</hi> and they gave the Sir-name
of <hi>Du Perron</hi> which was a Lordſhip belonging
to the Family, that he might be diſtinguiſhed
from his Eldeſt Brother in the family.</p>
            <p>His Mother being brought to Bed and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in, pretty fortunate for him, was followed
with a ſickneſs that hindred her up ſitting:
ſhe had been ill all along from the very time
of her being big, of Pulmonic diſtemper, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
to her by ſome diſpleaſure, that came
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:52044:4"/>
not to our notice: her Son who told us this
particular, only informed us that ſhe died
ſhortly after ſhe was delivered of him.</p>
            <p>The cares of the Father may well defend the
Child from thoſe inconveniencies which are
to be fear'd from the loſs of the Mother,<note place="margin">The condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his health.</note> yet
they cannot for all that, ſecure him from
thoſe infirmities that attend the weak diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
he brought into the World with him.
A dry cough and pale colour were hereditary
to him from his Mother, which he kept until
he was above twenty years of age: and all
Phyſitians whoever looked on him before that
time, condemned him to dye young. But amongſt
all theſe firſt rubs, he received one advantage
which he remembred all his Life time, that
is, that of being entruſted to a Nurſe who
omitted nothing at all, that her duty could
poſſibly require of her, which he was willing
generouſly to acknowledge by a Penſion he
ſettled upon her for the remainder of her life,
as ſoon as ever he found himſelf in a capacity
to enjoy and manage an Eſtate.</p>
            <p>The Death of his Mother did much contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
to the taking his Father off from his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
he had in <hi>Poicto<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>His reſiding in theſe Provinces, in ſome of
his Houſes, or in ſome place where his Eſtate
lay thereabouts, wonderfully pleas'd him till
that time, and he took great delight in going
thither to paſs away that time which his six
months ſervice in Parliament could ſpare him.
But a few years after he reduced himſelf
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:52044:4"/>
wholly to <hi>Britaigne,</hi> and there he fixt the reſt
of his days, by a new Marriage which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
with <hi>Anne Morin,</hi> Daughter to the
chief Preſident of the Chamber of Accompts
at <hi>Nants.</hi> He had by her a Son and a Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
The Son was Counſellour in Parliament,
<hi>Seigneur de Chavagnes</hi> by name, Father to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Chavagnes</hi> now living, a Counſellour
in the ſame Parliament, who has turn'd Prieſt

curioſity that appear'd in the Child to demand
the reaſons and effects of whatſoever enter'd,
by his ſenſes.</p>
            <p>The weakneſs of his diſpoſition, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy
of his health obliged the Father to
leave him along time under the tuition of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
Yet at the time they were but buſie
about his body, and endeavour to procure
him a good ſtrong conſtitution, he afforded
almoſt every day inſtances of the beautifulneſs
of his genious. He ſhewed, in the midſt of
theſe his infirmities ſuch promiſing diſpoſitions
for ſtudy; that his Father could not chuſe but
procure him the firſt exerciſes ſuitable to the
deſign he had of cultivating his ſtock of parts,
maugre the reſolution he had taken to make
ſure of the corporeal health of his Son, before
he attempted any thing upon his mind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:52044:5"/>
To this effect they carried on the buſineſs,
that nothing was ſpoiled. So that a Man may
ſay theſe firſt ſtudies were nothing but ſleight
Eſſays, and but ſuperficial rude draughts and

him perform when he was of Age.</p>

ſuch a tender affection for young <hi>Des Cartes

Paſſion to acquire the Sciences, and
this Paſſion being backt with a ſolid under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,

Colledge,<note place="margin">The fruits he reaped of his lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gick and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thicks.</note> and Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> continued
his Study of Ethicks. The Logick he ſtudied
the Winter foregoing, was the only one of
all the parts of Logick, whereto, as he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
declared, he applied himſelf the moſt
in the Colledge. From that time he perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that Syllogiſms, and the greateſt part of
the other inſtructions of your School Logick,
ſerve not ſo much to underſtand things which
one would fain know, as to explain thoſe one
knows to others: or elſe to prate without
judgement of thoſe whereof a man is ignorant,
which is the effect they aſcribe to <hi>Ramond Lul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies</hi>
Art. Of all the dictates he received from
his Maſters, he retained none but the four
Rules, which ſerved afterwards whereon to
ground his new Philoſophy, the firſt is, <hi>Not to
admit any thing for truth, that he did not clearly
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:52044:7"/>
and diſtinctly know to be ſo.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>To di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
things as far as poſſibly one could, the better
to reſolve them.</hi> The third, <hi>To regulate a Mans
Thoughts orderly, beginning with the moſt ſimple
objects, on purpoſe to come up by degrees, to the
knowledge of the moſt compound ones.</hi> The fourth
is, <hi>To omit nothing in the anumeration of the
things whoſe parts he is to examine.</hi> But at that
very time he compiled a ſingular method for
himſelf of diſputing in Philoſophy, which
mightily pleaſed his perpetual director Father
<hi>Charlet,</hi> as it did likewiſe his Tutor Father
<hi>Dinet,</hi> altho' it put him that moderated to
his Trumps. When they came to propound
an argument in the diſputation, he, at firſt,
asked ſeveral queſtions <hi>de definitione nominum;</hi>
then he asked if they did not agree about cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
received truths known, of which he
made them agree and conſent to. Thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
he compoſed only one argument, from
which it was very hard to get clear without
puſſing.</p>
            <p>The Study of the Morality of the Schools
ſtood him in ſtead, chiefly to make him
diſtinguiſh that of the Heathen, and of the
Moral honeſt man of the World, from that
of a Chriſtian, but we are at a loſs to know
certainly whether or no, he was beholding
to his Maſters Papers, for the four Maximes
wherein he makes all his particular Morality
to conſiſt. The firſt of theſe Maximes was
<hi>To obey the Laws and Cuſtoms of his Country.
ſticking cloſe to the Religion in which God was
pleaſed he ſhould be born.</hi> The ſecond, <hi>to be ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:52044:8"/>
and reſolute in his actions, and to adhere as
conſtantly to the moſt dubious opinions, when he
ſhould once be determined to follow them, as if
they were moſt certain.</hi> The third, <hi>to labour
rather to conquer himſelf than Fortune.</hi> To
change his deſire rather <hi>than the Order of the
World, and to perſuade himſelf that nothing is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
in our power, but our Thoughts.</hi> The
fourth, <hi>To determine and propoſe ſomething to
himſelf, without blaming other Men in their Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments
and different occupations, to determine
and propoſe to himſelf the buſineſs of improving his
reaſon; and to ſearch out the truth of all things
all his Life long.</hi> The year following which
he ſpent in the Study of Metaphiſicks was leſs
ſatisfactory to him, than the Study of Logick
and Ethicks. At that very time he perceived
himſelf perplext with errous and doubts, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead,
<hi>of that clear and diſtinct knowledge of
whatſoever conduceth to the benefit of Life,</hi> which
they bore him in hand he ſhould diſcover in his
Studies. The further he proceeded, the more
he diſcovered his own ignorance, he ſaw by the
Lectures of his Maſters and the reading of their
Books, that Phyloſophy had been cultivated
and improved from all antiquity by the men
of the moſt excellent parts that ever appear'd
in the World, and yet for all that, there was
not any thing in the World, of which men
did not diſpute, and call in queſtion, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
nothing but what was doubtful. All
the eſteem he had put upon his Maſters, could
not ſtock himſelf with preſumption to hope
that he could hit on it better than others;
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:52044:8"/>
conſidering the diverſity of opinions main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
by learned perſons touching the ſame
ſubject matter, there being never more than
one of them that could be true, he had already
accuſtom'd himſelf almoſt to repute whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was but probable, for falſe. If he had
never had but one Maſter, or if he had never
been acquainted with theſe different opinions
amongſt Philoſophers, he proteſteth he ſhould
never have had occaſion to ſequeſter himſelf,
and withdrawn from the number of ſuch who
muſt be content to follow other mens opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
rather than to find out others them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
But having learnt even when he was
in the Colledge, (they are his own expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons)
that one cannot imagine that thing ſo
uncouth and wild that hath not been advanced
by ſome Philoſopher or other, he pretends he
could by no means make choiſe of any one
guide, whoſe opinions could appear to him
much to be prefer'd before the opinions of
others: this was that which put him upon cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out himſelf a new road in proceſs of time,
and to undertake the conducting and manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
himſelf.</p>
            <p>In deſpight of all the rubs his tow'ring Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
met with in the purſuit of his Philoſophy,
yet was he to come to the end of his courſe,
in the ſame time as the reſt of his fellow Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
did, that never found any quaeries to
put, nor any difficulties to remove in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cripts
of their Maſters; they made him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
after that, to the Study of Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks,
to which he alloted his laſt years reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:52044:9"/>
at <hi>La fleſche,</hi> the delight he took there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
paid him with intereſt for the vaſt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
and pains the School Philoſophy had put
him to; and the progreſs he made there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
was ſo extraordinary, that the Colledge
of <hi>La fleſche</hi> hath acquired it ſelf by his means
the glory of having produc't the greateſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician
they ever yet ſaw. Amongſt the
parts of Mathematicks, he choſed the <hi>Analyſis</hi>
from Geometry, and <hi>Algebra</hi> to make the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of his particular application, on purpoſe
to purge them from what was unprofitable
and hurtful in them, and to bring them to
perfection, this is that he laboured about at
the very time he was in the Colledge, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
depending either upon his Maſter or fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
Collegians, if we give credit to thoſe
who would make him the Author of that ſort
of Algebra which they call the Key of all the
Liberal Arts and of all Sciences. Which
they eſteem as the beſt method, that ever ſaw
the light, to diſcern truth from falſhood.</p>
            <p>The diſpenſation he had obtain'd from the
Father Principal of the Colledge not to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged
to practiſe every punctilio of the School
Philoſophy, ſupply'd with an opportunity and
means to follow it as cloſely as he could rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
deſire. Father <hi>Charlet</hi> Rectour of
the Colledge had conceded to him amongſt
other priviledges, that of lying long in Bed,
as well by reaſon of his weakneſs of diſpoſition
as for that he obſerved in him a mind natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
inclin'd to meditation, <hi>Des Cartes</hi> finding
when he awaked all his Spirits recollected,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:52044:9"/>
and his Senſes much compoſed and ſedate af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
his Nights reſt improved all theſe favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
conjunctures for to meditate; this practice
turn'd ſo into a ſecond nature, that it was his
uſual manner of Studying all his Life after.
And one may ſafely ſay, that the World owes
to his Morning Meditations in Bed, all thoſe
fine important productions of his Brain both
in Philoſophy and Mathematicks.</p>

and half being Reſident therein, and returned
home to his Fathers Houſe, with the accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
Praiſes and Good Word of his Maſters
or Tutours. There remain'd to him all his
whole Life after, a great ſtock of thankful
acknowledgment for the obligation they laid
upon him, and he had a great kindneſs and
eſteem for the Colledge, which he was wont
to extol above all others, whether it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his own experience had afforded him a
more particular knowledge of it, or elſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
we are natural and commonly induced
to commend the Place of our Education
equally with that of our birth, and to boaſt of
our Maſters as of our Parents.</p>
            <p>But altho', he might be ſatisfied with his
Maſters upon his leaving the Colledge, yet
was he by no means ſatisfied with himſelf.<note place="margin">Small ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in his Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.</note>
It ſeem'd to him that he had got nothing by
his Studies, but a greater knowledge of his
ignorance, all the advantages he had gained,
in the Eyes of the World, and which were
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:52044:10"/>
bragg'd of as ſo many wonders, were all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
according to his own opinion, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barras
and perplexity, to doubts, and troubles
of mind. The Laurels wherewith his Maſters
crowned him, thereby to diſtinguiſh him
from his fellow Students, appeared to him
but Thorns.</p>
            <p>If we do not belye nor undervalue the
judgment of thoſe who were well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with thoſe times, we ſhould not deny but
that he abundantly deſerved, a ſtripling as he
was, that Rank, the Publick beſtowed on
him even at that time, amongſt the Able
Learned Men of the Age. But it was never
a more dangerous time to be laviſh of the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of a Wiſe and Knowing Perſon; for he
was not content only to reject this quality
which Men would have faſtened upon him:
but willing to meaſure other Mens Corn by
his own buſhel, it was ten to one but he had
taken thoſe who bore the ſame quality, for
no real Knowing Learned Men, and his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing
of whatſoever, Men Term, Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
was very like to have diſcovered it
ſelf.</p>
            <p>The diſpleaſure he conceived to ſee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
diſabuſed of the miſtake wherewith he
flatter'd himſelf to be able to acquire, <hi>A clear
and aſſured knowledge of whatſoever is profitable
to life.</hi> Was like to have precipitated him into
deſpair, ſeeing, beſides, that the Age he lived
in was as flouriſhing as any of the preceeding,
and phancying with himſelf that all the Men
of Parts, of which this Age was very fruitful,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:52044:10"/>
found themſelves in the ſame predicament he
was in, although peradventure they were ſo
ſenſible of it as himſelf; he had a ſhrewd
Temptation to believe, that there was no ſuch
thing as a Science in the World in every reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect,
ſuch an one as they made him hope for.</p>
            <p>The reſult of all theſe tedious,<note place="margin">He diſcards Books and Sciences, and why.</note> vexatious
Deliberations, was that from the year 1613.
he would forſake and diſcard all Books, and
totally rid himſelf of the Study of Learning.
By this kind of forſaking, he ſeem'd to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
the greateſt part of your Sparks of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
who are not neceſſitated to Study where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to ſubſiſt, or to get Preferment in the

theſe in bidding adieu to Books, dream of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe but to ſhake off that Yoak which
the Colledge had rendred inſupportable to
them, whereas Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> would not
have packt off his Books, for which, he had
otherwiſe a great love for; but only becauſe
he found not in them what he ſought for, upon

him for the Service of his King and Country

weakneſs of his Conſtitution, would not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
him to expoſe him ſo early to the Toiles
of War. He judged it adviceable, firſt to
let him ſee the World, to that purpoſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
to ſend him to <hi>Paris</hi> towards the Spring,
but perhaps it was a great over-ſight in him,
to Abandon him to his own Conduct, and
leave him to himſelf, without affording him
any other Governour but a <hi>valet de Chambre,</hi>
and not any to inſpect him beſides a Lacquey
or two: he relyed too confidently upon the
wiſdom of a Youth of 17. years, void of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
and of all helps, but his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per

            <p>Yea, and he had power enough to guard

any thoughts to return to his ſports and idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
it made him come the better to himſelf,
than the preſence of his Virtuous Friend did,
it inſpired into him the Reſolution to retire
from the World, and forſake even his uſual
Friends and Companions, on purpoſe to ſet
himſelf again to the Study that he had Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed.
He made choice of a place of
Retirement in the <hi>Fauxbourg</hi> St. <hi>Germain,</hi>
where he hired an Houſe out of the Noiſe,
and ſhut himſelf up, with only one or two
Servants, without ſo much as giving his Friends
or Kinſmen notice thereof. Having in this
manner recovered his guſto for Study, he was
over Head and Ears in the Study of Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks,
to which he beſtowed all that Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure

continued near upon two years.</p>

Such of his Friends which were good for
nothing elſe but to paſs away the time and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſement,
ſoon grew weary, that they ſee
him no more: They ſought him up and down,
but all in vain, in the City, at Court, and in
his Country; he was ſo wiſe at the beginning
of his Retirement, to prevent the chance of
meeting any, that he might not fall into the
Hands of theſe Troubleſome Perſons, when
he was obliged to go abroad about his occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
the buſineſs had no bad Succeſs for near
two years together; but he afterwards relyed
but too confidently upon the luckineſs of his
Solitude, for not being vigilant enough about
his regreſs and ingreſs, and not cautious of
his ways, and turnings as before, he was met
with by one of his Friends, whom he could
not get quit off, till ſuch time as he ſhould
diſcover the place of his Abode.</p>

to ſay no worſe, the Friend did ſo far prevail
by his frequent reiterated viſits, and by his
importunity, that he firſt troubled his Repoſe,
and then Diverted him from his beloved So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,
to bring him again upon the Stage of
the World; and to plung him again into Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements
as before.</p>
            <p>But he ſoon perceived he had changed his
Reliſh for Pleaſure, Games, and walkings were
not ſo Charming to him, as once before; and
the Enchantments of Worldly Delights, had
but very weak effects upon him, againſt the
Charms of Philoſophy and Mathematicks,
from which his Jovial Friends were not able
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:52044:14"/>
to free him. They made him ſpend the
Chriſtmas holy days <hi>Anno</hi> 1616. and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of the next year, till <hi>Shrovetide,</hi> as
merrily as they poſſibly could. But they
could not make him take delight in any thing
but Muſick, by a Conſort of which he could
not chuſe but be much taken, conſidering the
skill he had in Mathematick's.</p>
            <p>He no longer could hope from the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate

to have the liberty of retrieving and improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

ſooner or later, his deſign was not to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a great Warriour in this Prince his
School, ſo that in determining to bear Arms,
he reſolved never to appear any way forward
as an Actor, but every where to be but as a
Spectator of what is played in all ſorts of
Common-wealths and States, upon the Stages
of the World. He turned Souldier for no
other end, but only to Study the different
natures of men more according to nature, and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:52044:14"/>
to endeavour to make himſelf proof againſt
all the accidents of Life. That he might not
be uneaſie under any Superiour Power, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
upon his firſt entrance all Command and
all Engagements, and always maintained
himſelf at his own charges. But <hi>pro forma</hi> to
keep up the cuſtom he was to receive once
at leaſt his Pay, and had the curioſity to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
that piece of Money he had for his Pay
all his Life, as a Teſtimony of his having ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Army.</p>
            <p>He did really take delight in War at that
Age, but this inclination was but the effect
of the heat of his Liver, which was aſſwaged
in proceſs of time. Altho', the City of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da</hi>
where he lay in Garriſon, enjoy'd at that
time the quiet which was procured it by the
Truce concluded upon, between the <hi>Spaniard</hi>
and <hi>Hollander,</hi> yet for all that he always ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf an utter Enemy of Idleneſs and
Libertiniſm. Whether you conſider him in
his Military Occupations, wherein he was
aſſiduous and careful as any of the hotteſt for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeſt
Souldiers, or be it you look upon
him at the leiſure hours he could ſpare from
his Duties, which he employed in Study, when
others ſpent it in Debauchery.</p>
            <p>At that time it ſo happened, that an Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymus
perſon cauſed a Problem of Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
to be affixt up and down the ſtreets of
<hi>Breda,</hi> to be propounded to the Learned, and
to require the ſolution of it. Monſieur <hi>Des
Cartes</hi> beholding the concourſe of Paſſengers
ſtopping before the Note affixt Writ in Dutch,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:52044:15"/>
deſired the next Man he found by him, that
he would pleaſe to tell him either in Latin or
French, the ſubſtance of what is contained.
The Man, as good luck would have it, to
whom he addreſt himſelf, was willing to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
him, yet upon this condition, that he
on his part would be obliged to ſolve the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem,
which he judged it ſelf to be very
difficult. Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> accepted of the
condition with ſuch a reſolute Air, that the
Man little expecting ſuch a thing from a young
<hi>Cadel</hi> in the Army, gave him his name in
Writing, together with the Place of his
Abode, to the intent he might bring him the
ſolution of it when he ſhould find it out.
Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> underſtood by his Note,
that his Name was <hi>Iſaac Beekman,</hi> and that he
was Principal of the Colledge at <hi>Dort,</hi> no
ſooner was he return'd to his Quarters, but
ſetting himſelf to examine the Problem of the
unknown Perſon, after the Rules of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
he found out the ſolution of it with
much eaſe and readineſs, as <hi>Vieta</hi> once did in
reſolving in leſs than three hours, that famous
queſtion propounded by <hi>Adrian Romain</hi> to all
Mathematicians under the Cope of Heaven.
Not to fail of his Word, away he goes next

of the Problem, nay and offers to give
him the conſtruction of it, if he deſired ſo

               </note> His Solitude during this Winter was
wholly without interruption, eſpecially by
Perſons who were not capable of ſtarting
Queſtions in order to diſcourſe, yet did he
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot debar any one from his Chamber who
was inquiſitive, or underſtood how to diſcourſe
of Sciences or Philoſophical Tranſactions.
By Converſing with ſuch ſort of Perſons<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he
underſtood there was a Fraternity or Club of
Learned Men, ſettled in <hi>Germany</hi> ſome Years
ſince, under the Name of <hi>Brethren of Roſy Croſs,</hi>
they gave them wonderful Commendations
often to him, they buz'd in the Ear that they
were a ſort of Men which underſtood every
thing, and that they promiſed to help Men to
a new-Wiſdom; that is to ſay, a new Science
not hitherto diſcovered, adding all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digies
which every private Perſon told him
concerning it, to the rumor that was ſpread
abroad through <hi>Germany,</hi> about theſe Fellows;
He found himſelf ſo much the more concern'd
at it, becauſe he received the News at the
very time when he was the moſt buſy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the Mediums he was to propound to
himſelf for the finding out of Truth.</p>
            <p>He thought he was ingaged not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned
upon the account of the <hi>Roſa Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians,</hi>
becauſe, (ſays he to a Friend of his) if
theſe ſhould prove Impoſtures, it had been
unlawful to let them run away with ſo much
Reputation, ill-gotten, at the expences of the
Peoples Credulity; and if ſo be they were
able to produce any new thing into the World
which is worth knowing, it had been a moſt
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:52044:22"/>
baſe unworthy thing in him to under-value all
Sciences amongſt which he might find one, of
whoſe Foundation, he might have been igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant.
It was his Buſineſs therefore to find out
one of theſe new Virtuoſo's, that he might
underſtand what they were, upon his Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges,
and alſo confer with them. But ſeeing
one of their Statutes was, not to appear, what
really they were; not to be diſtinguiſhed from
other Men, neither by their Garb nor manner
of Living; nor to diſcover themſelves in their
Diſcourſe, you need not wonder if all his
Pains and Curioſity came to nothing.</p>
            <p>It was not poſſible for him to find out one
ſingle Man, who would really own himſelf of
that Fraternity, or that was but ſo much as
ſuſpected to be of it: It was an hundred to
one but he had put the Society out of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaments,
and rankt them amongſt Chimae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's;
but that which made him forbear to do
ſo, was the great ſhew the numerous Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getical
Pamphlets made, in favour of theſe
<hi>Roſacruſians,</hi> as well in Latin as High Dutch.
Yet he thought it not ſafe referring himſelf
to all theſe Apologies, whether it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
his inclination induced him to take theſe
new Virtuoſo's for Impoſtures, or elſe becauſe
renouncing all Books, he had a mind to inure
himſelf to judge of nothing but upon his own
proper Experience. And this is the reaſon
why he was free to ſay ſome few Years after,
that he knew nothing of the <hi>Roſacruſians:</hi> he
was likewiſe ſurprized that his Friends ſhould
tell him, returning to <hi>Paris</hi> 1623. that the

cauſed him to quit the Duke of <hi>Bavaria</hi>'s Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice

            <p>Wherefore chuſing for his future Voyages,<note place="margin">His <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.</note>
ſuch Countries that were not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> peſtered with
War, he applyed himſelf particularly, to ſee
and examine Princes Courts, to frequent the
company of perſons of different conditions,
and contrary humours. He Studyed moreover
to make a Collection of ſeveral Experiments,
as well upon the natural Productions of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Climats he paſt through, as upon politick
matters, which he obſerved amongſt People,
in reſpect of their Cuſtoms, Manners of Lives,
and Inclinations. This is what he calls <hi>the
Great Book of the World:</hi> Wherein he maketh
account to find out true Science, diſpairing to
find it any where elſe, except in this Volum
opened to every ones view, and in himſelf,
according to his perſwaſion, that the Seeds
which God hath Sown in us, are not ſo totally
ſtifled by ignorance; or other effects of ſin.</p>
            <p>According to theſe principles, he intended
that theſe Voyages and Travels, ſhould ſerve
him to make trial upon himſelf, in the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
and Occurrences fortune ſhould propoſe
to him, and that they might put him upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Advantagious reflexions upon every
thing that preſented it ſelf, and became pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:52044:25"/>
to him, for the Conduct of his Life;
For he flatter'd himſelf with the hopes of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more of truth in the reaſoning private
perſons uſe, touching their own concerns;
than in thoſe which a great Schollar ſhut up in
his Study, uſeth upon Speculations, which or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
produce no other effects, than Vanity
and Haughtineſs, and ſometimes he prides
himſelf the more in them, by how much they are
for the moſt part more diſſonant to common
Senſe, after he hath labour'd and ſet all his
Wits upon the Rack, to make them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.</p>
            <p>But to ſpeak the truth, when he applyed
himſelf only, narrowly to ſurvey the manners
of other Men, he found very little in them,
whereby he could make himſelf ſure of any
thing. He perceived in a manner, as great a
diverſity in them, as he had before met with,
in the Opinions of Philoſophers: So that the
greateſt Advantage that occurred to him by
that inquiry, was, that ſeeing ſeveral things,
how extravagant and ridiculous ſoever they
may appear to us, yet do not ceaſe for all that,
to be commonly received and approved of by
other People; he learnt at laſt, not to believe
any thing upon ſlight grounds, and not ſtifly
and peremptorily to ſtand up for that which
both Example and Cuſtom had formerly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
him to be right.</p>
            <p>Leaving <hi>Hungary,</hi> he took another turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

            <p>But this putting things in order,<note place="margin">He was in danger of his Life.</note> the better

which was by no means favourable to his pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et,
and that they might deprive him of means

him away: They perceived he was a Stranger,
come from ſome remote Country, who had
ſmall acquaintance in the Country, and that

no Body would proſecute them, if he chanced

their Counſel before his Face, not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he underſtood any other Language
beſides that, in which he Diſcourſt with his
<hi>valet de Chambre;</hi> at laſt, the reſult of their
Deliberation, was to knock him on the Head,

withal, threatning to run them through, if

Phyſicks or Natural Philoſophy. Finding a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance
of diſcouragement in the little cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty

had teſtified already, before he went to Travel,
a great predilection, and one may lawfully ſay
he was as good as his Word, for he loved it to
his latter end. But it was without oſtentation,
and more for the regulating his own behaviour

Obſervation upon Nature, being perſuaded,
<q>That the moſt certain means to know how
we ought to live, is to know before hand
what kind of Creatures we are, what kind of
World it is we live in, and who is the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor

been very ſerviceable to him in eſtabliſhing

the juſtice not to prefer his private opinions

            <p>In reſpect of theſe actions of his Life which
he believed could not admit of delay, when
he was not in a condition to diſcern the trueſt
opinions, he always ſtuck cloſe to thoſe that
were probable. If it ſo happened that he met
not with more probability in ſome of them,
than he did in others, yet did he not ceaſe to
determine upon one, and not to conſider them
afterward, as dubious in reſpect of practice,
but as very true and certain, becauſe that he
found that the reaſon he had to determine and
pitch upon one, was ſuch as by this means he
acquired the habit of delivering himſelf from
repentings and remorſes, which uſually rack
the Conſciences of weak and unſtable Spirits,
who are induced but too raſhly to practiſe as
good, the things which they judge afterwards
to be evil. Being perſuaded that his Will
never inclin'd him to purſue or avoid any
thing, but ſo far forth as his underſtanding
did repreſent it to him good or evil, he thought
it ſufficed him, to judge well for to do well,

the latter end of <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1628. only to be an
Eye-witneſs of the Siege which was already
far advanced, that he might Survey, as a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician,

he could not handſomly forbear ſerving in

wherewith the King in Perſon order'd his

he was ſoon follow'd by divers Gentlemen of
his Age, who came only to the Siege out of a

he aſſiſted the next day, being <hi>All Souls,</hi> at

where he was againſt <hi>Martinmaſs.</hi>
               <note place="margin">He was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at the Nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio's Houſe.</note>

            <p>XIV. Some few days after, he was at an Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly

at the Pope's Nuncio's Houſe, who was called
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:52044:37"/>
Monſigneur <hi>Bagne,</hi> created Cardinal ſhortly
after, who honoured our Philoſopher with his
acquaintance a good while ago. Monſieur <hi>Des
Cartes</hi> was invited thither, and carried along
with him Father <hi>Merſennus</hi> and Monſ. <hi>de Ville
Breſſieux</hi> to hear the Sieur <hi>Chandoux,</hi> who was
there to debate concerning ſome new Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chandox</hi> made a long Diſcourſe for to refute
the way of teaching Philoſophy, uſed in the
Schools. He propoſed moreover, a pretty
common Syſtem of Philoſophy which he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to introduce, and had a mind to make
it paſs for a new one.</p>
            <p>The Pleaſantneſs wherewith he accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
his Diſcourſe, did ſo impoſe upon the
Company, that he received from it an almoſt
Univerſal Applauſe, except from Monſieur
<hi>Des Cartes,</hi> who was not forward to demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
outwardly any ſigns of Satisfaction
which indeed he had not received from the
Diſcourſe of the Sieur <hi>de Chandeux.</hi> Cardinal
<hi>Berulle,</hi> who was one of the Aſſembly, took
ſpecial notice of his Silence; which put him
upon demanding his Opinion touching what he
had heard, which appear'd ſo excellent to the
Company.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> did all that he could to
excuſe himſelf from delivering his Mind decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
that he had nothing to ſay againſt it after
the Approbation of ſo many knowing Men.<note place="margin">They make him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain his meaning in his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.</note>
This ſhuffling accompanied with a certain
tone, which ſomewhat ſuſpicious, made the
Cardinal conjecture he did not judge of the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:52044:37"/>
Diſcourſe altogether as the others did; which
mov'd him ſtill the more to urge him to declare
what he thought of it. Monſieur the Nuncio,
and other moſt remarkable Perſons in the
Aſſembly joyn'd their Intreaties to thoſe of
the Cardinal, to urge him to ſpeak his Mind.
So that not being able to recoil without being
incivil, he told the Company, that the truth
of it was, he had never yet heard any one that
could boaſt of ſpeaking more to the purpoſe
than Monſieur <hi>de Chandoux</hi> had done. He
firſt of all commended the Eloquence of his
Diſcourſe, and his great Talent he was endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with for quaint words and expreſſions. He
commended withal that generous Liberty he
demonſtrated for indeavouring to deliver Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
from the Perplexity of the Schoolmen.
But he took occaſion from this Diſcourſe, to
obſerve to them the Power of <hi>veri ſimilitudo,</hi>
taking the upper hand of Truth, which upon
this occaſion ſeem'd to have triumphed over
the Judgment of ſo many grave, judicious
Perſons. Adding withall, that at ſuch time
as one has to deal with People eaſie enough
to take up with very ſimilitude or likelihood,
as the illuſtrious Aſſembly before which he
had the honour to ſpeak had done, it was not
difficult to put off falſe Ware for true, and
interchangeably make Truth paſs for Falſhood
by means of appearing ſo.</p>
            <p>For to give them an inſtance of it upon the
ſpot, he demanded of the Aſſembly that ſome
body in the Company would give himſelf the
trouble to propoſe to him ſuch a Truth as he
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:52044:38"/>
pleaſed, that might be in the number of thoſe
that appear the moſt inconteſtable and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable:
they did ſo; and with a Dozen Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments
every one more probable than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
he proved to the Company that it was
Falſe. Then he bid them propoſe to him a
Fallacy or Falſhood, ſuch an one as Men com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
take for a moſt evident one; and by
means of another Dozen of probable Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he forced the Auditors to acknowledge
it to be plauſible Truth. The Aſſembly was
ſurprized at the extent of the Genious Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> ſhewed in his Reaſoning; but
it was ſtill more aſtoniſhing to ſee themſelves
too plainly convinced of the eaſineſs with
which our Mind becomes Cully'd by very Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude.</p>
            <p>Then they asked him, If he could think of
no infallible Expedient to avoid Sophiſms?
He reply'd, That he knew none more certain
than that he himſelf made common uſe of;
adding withal, That he had fetched it from
Mathematicks; and that he did not believe
that their could be any Truth, that he could
not clearly demonſtrate by this means accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to his own Principles.</p>
            <p>This way was nothing elſe but his Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Method, which he calls otherwiſe his <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Method,</hi> according to which he try'd and
ſquar'd all ſorts of Propoſitions. The firſt
benefit of this Method was to demonſtrate at
the firſt ſight, whether the Propoſition was
poſſible or no; the other benefit conſiſted in
making him infallibly to ſound the difficulty
of the ſaid Propoſition.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:52044:38"/>
There was not any Perſon in the Company
that did not appear much taken with his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings,<note place="margin">The Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal makes him reſolve to Publiſh his Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy.</note>
but no body took greater Satisfaction
in them than Cardinal <hi>de Berulle,</hi> who declar'd
to Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> that he could wiſh to
hear him once more upon the ſame Subject in
private. Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> very ſenſible
of the Honour a Perſon of his Dignity did him,
paid him a viſit ſome days after, and diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
with him concerning the firſt Notions he
conceived about Philoſophy, after he had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the ſmall benefit that flows from the
means commonly uſed to treat of it. And by
the way, he ſhewed him the conſequences his
Thoughts might produce, if they were rightly
guided, and the benefit and advantage that
would accrew to the Publick, if they would
but apply his way of Philoſophy to Medicine
or Phyſick and Mechanicks; one whereof
would produce the recovery and preſervation
of Health, the other the leſſening and relieving
Labours.</p>
            <p>The Cardinal had not much adoe to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the importance of the deſign, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him the moſt proper Perſon to put it in
execution, he made uſe of the Authority he
had upon his Spirit to induce him to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
this great Work. Nay, he made it caſe
of Conſcience, he gave to underſtand that
having received from God Strength and Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
of Mind, and withall was ſo enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
to this effect which was not granted to
others, it behoved him to render an exact ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
how he improved his talent, and that
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:52044:39"/>
he would be reſponſible before the Supreme
Judge of all the World, for the injury he
ſhould do to Mankind, in depriving them of
the benefit of his Meditations. Yea, and went
ſo far as to aſſure him, that conſidering the
capacity of his genius, ſo vaſt as he knew it to
be, God would not be wanting to him in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing
his Bleſſing upon his Labour, and
granting him all the Succeſs he could poſſibly
expect.</p>
            <p>The impreſſion that Pious Cardinal made
upon him, ſeconded with what his own good
Nature and Reaſon dictated to him long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
won him over to reſolve upon it. Till that
time he had been of no Party in Philoſophy, &amp;
had made choice of no Sect, as he himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
us. He perſiſted in his reſolution to
keep his Liberty, and to work upon Nature it
ſelf, without inſiſting much upon ſeeing in what
he might come nearer, or be further off from
thoſe that treated of Philoſophy before him.</p>
            <p>The earneſt requeſts his Friend renewed to
him for to haſten him to communicate his
clear Notions to the Publick, did not permit
him any longer to go back with his word, He
now only deliberates about the means how he
might moſt commodiouſly execute his deſign;
having obſerved two main Obſtacles that might
prevent his ſucceeding, to wit, the heat of the
climat, and croud and hurly-burly of People: he
reſolved to retire for good and all from the
place of his Friends and Acquaintance, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure

Prieſts of the Oratory, in whoſe hands he
might intruſt the direction of his Conſcience
all the while he remain'd in <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No ſooner was he ſettled in <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> but
(not being able to forget the End and Scope
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:52044:43"/>
of his Philoſophy,<note place="margin">His Study of Phyſick, Anatomy and Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry.</note> which was only the benefit
of Mankind) he ſeriouſly undertook the Study
of Phyſick, applying himſelf more particularly
to Anatomy and Chymiſtry. He imagined
that nothing was more capable to produce the
temporal Felicity of this World, than an hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
Union of Phyſick with Mathematicks; But
before he was in a Capacity to contribute any
Comfort or Relief to Mens Labours, or could
multiply the Conveniencies of Life by Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks,
he thought it neceſſary to find out ſome
way or other to ſecure Humane Body from
Evils that might diſturb its Health, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
it of power and force to Labour.</p>
            <p>Upon this Perſwaſion, he began to put his
deſigns in execution by Study of Anatomy;
wherein he employ'd all the Winter he ſpent
at <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> He declares, That he had ſo
much eagerneſs for the Knowledge of this,
that it made him go almoſt every day to a
Butcher's Shop to ſee him Kill Beaſts, and
from thence he cauſed the Parts of ſuch Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals
to be brought home to his Lodging, as
he deſign'd to Anatomize at his own leiſure.
This was his common Practice, frequently in
other places where he was ſince, thinking that
there was no diſgrace for him, nor any thing
unbeſeeming his Condition in the practice of
a thing that was in it ſelf very innocent, and
might prove very ſerviceable in its effects.</p>
            <p>He joyned the Study of Chymiſtry to that
of Anatomy, from the latter end of the Year
1629. and he aſſures us, that he learn't daily
in this Science, as he did in other, ſomething
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:52044:43"/>
that did not occur in Books; but before he
would apply his Mind to the finding out Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes
and Remedies, he had a deſire to know
whether or no there was any means to find out
a Medicine that might be grounded upon infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible
Demonſtration.</p>
            <p>VI. VII. Theſe Beginnings were abundance
more Proſperous to him than he durſt hope
they would have been,<note place="margin">The ill Conduct of <hi>Beeckman</hi> and <hi>Ferrier.</hi>
               </note> and there could be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
wanting to his Satisfaction to ſee the firſt
ſucceſs of his Studies, but the aſſurance of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the iſſue of them; the great delight he
took in them, made him more and more reliſh
the ſweetneſs of his retirement; and nothing
diſturb'd his repoſe this Year, but the ill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
of <hi>Beeckman</hi> and <hi>Ferrier</hi> towards him.</p>
            <p>The firſt, above Thirty Years elder than he,
ſeeing his Reputation to increaſe in the eyes of
the World, diſcovered a Pedantick Itch to
make People believe that he had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
his Maſter: altho' he himſelf had learnt
of Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> that of which he
bragg'd up and down he had taught him;
thereupon he took him to task, Doccumen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized
him handſomly to make him know him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
and altho' he was willing to forego
ſomething he had given him formerly upon
Algebra, Dioptricks, and Geometry; yet he
made him reſtore him the Original of his
Treatiſe of Muſick, that he might at leaſt keep
his Vanity within Bounds.</p>
            <p>The other, acknowledging his Fault he had
committed the foregoing Year, in refuſing to
go along with Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> to live
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:52044:44"/>
with him in <hi>Friezland,</hi> &amp; being willing to make
amends, at a time when M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> was no
longer in a capacity to ſuch like advantagious
Kindneſſes, made, as if he complain'd of his
bad Fortune to frame real Complaints againſt
Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his Benefactor. He car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
his Complaints every where, where there
was any conſiderable Perſons that knew him,
ſeveral of which writ to Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
in his behalf. Now he, that he might not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſuſpected of hard dealing, ſee himſelf
obliged to argue the caſe with them, and to
juſtifie the diſtance and impoſſibility that there
was for him to grant at that time thoſe Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he had urged him to accept of, when he
intreated him to come live with him at <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necker.</hi>
Nevertheleſs, after he had convinc'd
him in particular, that he might take himſelf
only for all the hardſhips he ſuffer'd and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd
of, he was willing to take up his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
thoughts of good will towards him, as he
had done in reſpect of <hi>Beeckman.</hi>

him for thoſe petty Cauſes of being vext,
that theſe two Men had adminiſtred, there
happened two things in relation to two other
of his Friends, which he reckon'd amongſt
the good Fortunes of this Year. The firſt, was
a Viſit Father <hi>Merſennus</hi> went to make him as
far as <hi>Amſterdam.</hi> The ſecond, was the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing
of Father <hi>Gibeuf</hi>'s Book concerning the
Liberty of God and of the Creature, wherein
he had the pleaſure to find where-withall to
authorize what he conceived of Indifference

Queſtions that were propounded to him, in
the Pacquets he ſent him; He challenged him
alſo to ſend him ſome of his own Problems to

who had publickly profeſſed his Philoſophy,

at <hi>Deventer,</hi> ſway'd much with Monſieur <hi>Des
Cartes</hi> to go live in that Town; which he
did in the Year 1633. in the Spring: there he
he buſied himſelf to continue divers works he
had broke off the preceding Year, particularly
his Dioptricks, and his Treatiſe of the World;
he applied himſelf likewiſe afreſh to the
knowledge of Celeſtial Matters, and his Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomical
Obſervations made him quickly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
the neceſſity of ſtudying the Natures
of Comets to the purpoſe.</p>
            <p>He took occaſion from this ſort of Study,
to draw up the Model of the Hiſtories of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial
Appearances, for Father <hi>Merſennus,</hi> juſt
ſuch as he conceived it to be, for the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance

delight in ſparing no pains for the advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:52044:46"/>
of Sciences, even to be willing to
make Experiments at their own Coſt and
Charges.</p>
            <p>X. During this Year's Summer,<note place="margin">His Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the World.</note> he finiſhed
his Treatiſe of the World, long look'd for by
Father <hi>Merſennus</hi> and his Friends with great
impatience. He call'd it <hi>his World,</hi> becauſe it
was the Idea of a World that he had imagined
anſwerable to the World we live in; and he
compriſed in an Abridgment all his Phyſicks,
I mean, all that he could come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of, concerning material things, ſaving
only that which relates to Light, which he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to explain in its full Extent and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude.</p>
            <p>That he might not be engaged to follow
or refute the Opinions commonly received a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Learned, he was willing to give
over this ſame World to the exerciſing of
their Brains in diſputing about it; and to ſpeak
only of that which might happen in a <hi>New
World,</hi> put the caſe God did create ſufficient
matter on the imaginary ſpaces to Compoſe
ſuch. He ſuppoſed God would diverſly and
confuſedly agitate the parts of this matter, ſo
that he would Compoſe of it a <hi>Chaos,</hi> or an
indigeſted confuſed Maſs, and that in proceſs
of time, he ſhould only ſend his Ordinary
Concourſe to Nature, and let her act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
to the Laws and Ordinances he hath
eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>Upon this Suppoſition he deſcribes you this
matter at the very firſt, he made appear what
kind of Laws of Nature theſe were; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:52044:46"/>
afterward, that the greateſt part
of the matter of this <hi>Chaos</hi> ought, conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in obedience to theſe Laws, diſpoſe and
range themſelves after ſuch a manner, that
would make it reſemble our Heavens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From the deſcription of all Bodies imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable
that could be compoſed of this matter,
he was pleaſed to proceed to the Explanation
of the reaſonable Soul, upon which he judged
it convenient to expatiate more at large. He
demonſtrates, that it cannot be deduced from
the power of the matter, as were other things
he handled; but that it is expreſly to be
created.</p>
            <p>XI. He reviſed his Treatiſe of the World,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Gallilaeus</hi> his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation makes him keep this Treatiſe lock'd up.</note>

Printed in <hi>Paris</hi> with the King's Priviledge,

befell <hi>Gallilaeus.</hi> This Mathematician had been
obliged by the Inquiſition of the Holy Office,
publickly to abjure his Sentiment of the
Earth's Motion, as a rank Hereſy; ay, and
he hampered in the Priſon of the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
            <p>This Adventure did ſo much the more
ſurprize Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> as he, on one
ſide had a more than ordinary Submiſſion to
the Holy See; and becauſe on the other ſide he
was perſwaded that the Opinion of the Earth's
motion is by much the moſt probable, and
withal the moſt Commodious for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
all Phenomena's. Upon this Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis
he had Built the greateſt part of this

<pb n="88" facs="tcp:52044:47"/>
it without rendring all the reſt defective<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
he thought it more adviſable to ſuppreſs and
conceal his Treatiſe, than to ſend it abroad
lame and imperfect, or to expoſe himſelf to
that ſcurvy humour of the Inquiſitors of <hi>Rome,</hi>
by publiſhing that Hypotheſis they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
without underſtanding it. Yet he
was reſolved to have the other touch at it,
and new model his Explanation of the Earth's
motion, to ſhew which way one may deny
this motion, in oppoſition to <hi>Gallilaeus,</hi> altho'
in truth, it may really be carried about, and
tho' the Hypotheſis of <hi>Copernicus</hi> remain in
full force, which he did not ſo much out of
Croſsneſs to ſtupifie the Inquiſitors, as for to
explain thoſe Paſſages of Scripture which are
commonly alledg'd againſt this Opinion.</p>

            <p>A little while after,<note place="margin">He goes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Denmark</hi> with M. <hi>Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le Breſſieux.</hi>
               </note> he took a Journey into

profited no leſs by his Inſtructions upon their

was upon theſe Precepts, and chiefly upon his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:52044:47"/>
grand Maxim, That <hi>the moſt Plain and Simple
things are uſually the most Excellent,</hi> That Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Ville Breſſieux</hi> invented ſo many pretty
neat Machines beneficial for the uſe of Life.</p>
            <p>He inculcated to him divers other Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
upon which this Man made ſeveral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments
ſince, which hath gotten him a name
of being an extraordinary Virtuoſo in Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,
Mechanicks and Opticks.</p>
            <p>At the time Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> left the
City of <hi>Deventer, Reneri</hi> likewiſe went thence
for <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> whither the Magiſtracy had drawn
him by fair words to Read Philoſophy in the
Colledge, which was very ſpeedily to be
changed into an Univerſity. This ingenious
Man, who had at his leiſure quite exhauſted
Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his Philoſophy at the very
Fountain Head when he enjoy'd his preſence,
laid hold on ſuch a favourable Conjuncture as
this, to bring the whole Univerſity over to
be <hi>Carteſians,</hi> that it might be illuſtrious at
its very birth; which he effected with ſo
much Prudence and Diſcretion, that there
would never have been occaſioned any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance
there, had not the Precipitated Zeal
of him that ſucceeded him, quite ſnar'd his
fine oeconomy.</p>
            <p>The Winter following afforded Monſieur
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> matter for thoſe Obſervations he
made upon Snow of ſix Points or Angles;<note place="margin">An Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Snow of an hexago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal figure.</note> and,
upon that occaſion, to make ſome upon Hail
and Rain. He ſince Compiled a Sixth Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of them, which is to be ſeen in the
Treatiſe of his Meteors. But above all, he
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:52044:48"/>
ſeem'd ſo much ſatisfied with the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the Snow that fell that Winter gave him
occaſion to make, that he could have deſired
that all the Experiments that he was neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
to try for the reſt of his Phyſicks, <hi>might
have dropt from the Clouds in that manner;</hi> and
that he might have ſtood in need of nothing
but his Eyes to know them.</p>
            <p>Remembring his delightful abode at <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter,</hi>
he was moved to return to that City,
to avoid the frequent Viſits his Sojourning at
<hi>Amſterdam</hi> drew upon him. Five or Six Months
after, <hi>viz.</hi> towards the latter end of Autumn,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1635. he paſs'd into <hi>Friezland</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to <hi>Lewarden,</hi> the Principal City of the
Province, two Leagues from <hi>Franeker,</hi> where
he remain'd till the Year 1629. there he Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
or rather that I may make uſe of his
own Expreſſion, he Broached his ſmall Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe

Friend and Correſpondent, a Gentleman of
great Worth, Counſellor and Secretary to the
Prince of <hi>Orange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He came back to <hi>Amsterdam</hi> about the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

The liberty he took to Publiſh theſe Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes

<hi>Dioptricks,</hi> and more eſpecially of his

Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> anſwered him, and
they were very well ſatisfied one with another
for to continue their Friendſhip the remainder

            <p>He anſwered alſo about the ſame time, the
Objections of an <hi>Holland</hi> Phyſician who had
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:52044:52"/>
Preferment at <hi>Louvain</hi> named <hi>Plempius,</hi> who
was one of his Acquaintance ſome Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
Theſe Objections related chiefly to what
he had writ concerning the Motion of the
Heart. They contained, according to his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
whatſoever one was able reaſonably to
object againſt him upon this Subject. <hi>Plempius,</hi>
who declared that he had not made theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections,
but with a deſign to be better in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd,
and for the better diſcovering of
truth; let Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> at that time
know, that he was very well pleaſed that he
had anſwered him.</p>
            <p>The Anſwer he gave Monſieur <hi>Ciermans,</hi>
Profeſſor of Mathematicks in the Colledge of
Jeſuits at <hi>Louvnin,</hi> had no worſe ſucceſs. He
found this Father's Objections very judicious
and ſolid, the main hinge they turn'd upon
was Geometry and Meteors, and eſpecially in
reference to the Rain-bow. The Father on
his part ſeem'd ſo well ſatisfy'd with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> gave, that he freely
gave his conſent that they might Print his
Objections with the Anſwer. He could not
forbear declaring, that what he chiefly liked
in Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> was <q>
                  <hi>that boldneſs, that
made him turn aſide out of the beaten Paths and
Common Roads; and that he was indued with the
Confidence to enquire after new Lands, and make
new Diſcoveries.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> having no other Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion

Truth, and believing that he was not capable
of accompliſhing it alone, fought for, if one

may ſo ſay, Adverſaries, rather than Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers;
to the end that the Obligation to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
them, and ſift their Objections, might
render him more and more exact, and might
be a means to make him open his Eyes upon
that he was not able to know before. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to this he hopefully expected the Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
the Jeſuits of <hi>La Fleſche, Louvain, Lifle,</hi>
and ſome other places had promiſed him by
their Letters; but he was ſomewhat ſurprized
to learn by ſome of them, that they <hi>wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
approved of him, that they deſired nothing as

which he would not write; and that they deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded

Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> and to give Credit to his
new Speculation of Dioptricks, amongſt thoſe

underſtand by Father <hi>Merſennus,</hi> that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal

they had made to him, of endeavouring

to the Rules he had Preſcribed in his
Dioptricks.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> thought it ſtood him
upon to croſs this Underſtanding, and to that
effect, he deſired Father <hi>Merſennus</hi> to declare
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:52044:54"/>
to M. <hi>Des Argues,</hi> and others, that had an
hand in this Buſineſs; that he was extreamly
obliged to them for the good Opinion they
had given to the Court of his Dioptrical In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions;
but that he <hi>did not believe that the
Cardinal's thoughts ought to ſtoop ſo low as to a
Perſon of his Rank.</hi> It was not out of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonableneſs
that he reſiſted the purpoſes of
theſe Gentlemen; it was out of timerouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
leſt they might not ſucceſsfully compaſs
their End in his Abſence, and leſt they might
lay the Workmens fault at his door; for he
judged his preſence neceſſary to direct the

according as they proceeded, or
failed.</p>

he took this action for a defiance; the
manner of ſending the Challenge added to the
Merit of the Perſon who ſent, prevail'd with
him to avoid this occaſion; the Paper he ſent
to Father <hi>Merſennus</hi> againſt his Treaty <hi>de

City of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> and the Village of <hi>Egmond,</hi>
were the utmoſt bounds of the Liſt, where it
ſeem'd very difficult for the Parties to try their
Skill; and they were both too ſtout, and ſtood
too much upon their Pantofies to advance one
ſtep, one in favour of the other. Providence
ordered a place between, and diſpoſed matters
in ſuch a manner, that <hi>Paris,</hi> where were their
acquaintance, friends, and foes, became inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
the Randezvouſe where their difference
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:52044:56"/>
was to be decided; Father <hi>Merſennus,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ever dreaming of ſuch a thing, gave occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
for this diſpoſing of matters, by putting
into Monſieur <hi>Roberval</hi>'s and Monſieur <hi>Paſcal's</hi>
hands-at <hi>Paris,</hi> the Paper of our Philoſopher,
which he ſhould have ſent directly to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur

way that his buſineſs ſhould come to Trial at
<hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But now ſince theſe two Gentlemen had
thought fit to appear in his Cauſe as Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates,<note place="margin">Monſ. <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorge,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hardy</hi> on Mr. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> ſide, Mr. <hi>Paſcal</hi> and Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berval</hi> on Mr. <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mat</hi>'s.</note>
he deſired they would be pleaſed not
to be his Judges, or that they would except
againſt thoſe that were appointed, with others
of Monſieur <hi>de Fermat</hi>'s friends; the other
Mathematicians that might have been engaged
to have ſit Judges in the Cauſe, without doubt
were not a few; but ſome of them were not
capable of underſtanding Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
his Geometry, and others were not well
enough known by him, except two worthy
Geometricians, to whoſe Judgment he might
ſafely have referr'd himſelf; they were Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Mydorge,</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Hardy,</hi> who paſt
generally for his two intimate friends. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
render'd them no leſs liable to be
excepted againſt by Monſieur <hi>Fermat,</hi> than
Monſieur <hi>Paſcal</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Roberval</hi> were
by Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> by reaſon of their
great acquaintance with Monſieur <hi>Fermat:</hi>
Therefore it was his beſt way to reſolve to
chuſe them not ſo much his Judges, as Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates;
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:52044:56"/>
or to ſpeak in the Language of the
<hi>Cartel</hi> or Challenge preſented by Monſieur
<hi>Fermat,</hi> Monſieur <hi>Mydorge,</hi> and Monſieur
<hi>Hardy</hi> were retained by Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
for his Seconds, to oppoſe Monſieur <hi>Paſcal</hi>
and Monſieur <hi>Roberval,</hi> who had offerr'd to
ſecond Monſieur <hi>Fermat</hi> in the Combat. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Merſennus</hi> was deſired to ſtand Neuter,
and be content with the office of a bare Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
on purpoſe that he might not be ſuſpected
by either Party, to hold with the Hare, and
run with the Hound.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> immediately produced
the Writings, ſent them with the Inſtructions
neceſſary in order to the hearing of his Proces

and Monſieur <hi>Hardy,</hi> and recommended
to them withal to forget or ſuſpend the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of friendſhip, to adhere to the Rules of
Juſtice and Truth. If Monſieur <hi>de Fermat</hi> had
taken three Advocates on his ſide, Monſieur
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> would have been ſure to have taken
Monſieur <hi>Des Argues</hi> for his third, being no

and to let him have the peruſing of all
the Writings if he ſhould deſire it.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other Pieces, he ſent directly to

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:52044:57"/>
               <hi>Roberval,</hi> without letting the heat whereinto

who had paſs'd his word to carry on the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
of Monſieur <hi>de Fermat</hi> in his name againſt
Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes.</hi> Monſieur <hi>Paſcal</hi> was
not at <hi>Paris</hi> at that time; he withdrew out of
the City upon the occaſion of ſome Troubles
that aroſe upon the account of one of his
friends; and Monſieur <hi>Roberval</hi> was a truſty
Steward in the mean time to ſignifie his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,

alone. Monſieur <hi>Paſcal</hi> ſcarce took any more
cogniſance of this Diſpute, becauſe at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
he was preferr'd to be Intendant of Juſtice
in <hi>Rouen.</hi> The clowniſhneſs and moroſeneſs

but alſo writ to Father <hi>Merſennus</hi> to beſeech

a work to find a way to reconcile them, and to
change their Diſpute into a perfect amity
and correſpondence; the benefit whereof they
might reap in a mutual Communication of

of it with no ſmall joy; and having thanked
Monſieur <hi>Mydorge</hi> and Monſieur <hi>Hardy</hi> for
the good ſucceſs of their friendly Offices, he
charged Father <hi>Merſennus</hi> to ſignifie to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>de Fermat,</hi> his eſteem for him, and his
cordial affection towards him. Monſieur <hi>de
Fermat</hi> receiving from Father <hi>Merſennus</hi> all
the aſſurances he could poſſibly deſire on the
part of Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> gave himſelf the
ſatisfaction at laſt to write to him ſtraightways<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
to offer him his friendſhip and ſervices. The
Acquiſition of ſuch a friend as that, might be
numbered amongſt Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his
beſt Fortunes: He perfectly underſtood the
value of ſo important a friendſhip; he appear'd
ſo ſenſible of it, that there were no expreſſions
paſſionate enough to thank him for it.</p>
            <p>To the end he might not be ſatisfied with

as Objections, which he lookt upon the moſt
ſubſtantial of all thoſe that had been hitherto

This eſteem of his Objections did ſo puff up
Monſ. <hi>Morinus,</hi> who muſt needs ſhew by a
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:52044:59"/>
Reply to his Anſwer, that he was altogether
unworthy of it. Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> makes a

a diſſertation of <hi>Geoſtatiques;</hi> that is to
ſay, upon the Query, to know whether a body
weighs more or leſs, being near the Center of

it. The Book that had given occaſion to the
writing of it, had for its Author Monſ. <hi>Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grand,</hi>
Secretary to the King, indifferently
skill'd in Mathematicks, but who did not do
himſelf Juſtice enough in this point: He was

he could not forbear letting ſlip ſome ſtrokes

But he was quickly recovered of this weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi>
which one would, had been <hi>Carteſian</hi> from its
Cradle: After they had made <hi>Reneri</hi> come
from <hi>Deventer</hi> to anticipate its erection; it was
inſenſibly fill'd with the Diſciples of our Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher
under the Diſcipline of this able Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor.</p>
            <p>He that ſtickled moſt was a young Phyſician
named <hi>Henry de Roy, alias Regius.</hi> to whom
<hi>Reneri</hi> communicated this excellent Method
he received from Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to guide and conduct his Reaſon in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearch
of all ſorts of Truth. <hi>Regius</hi> would not
limit his knowledge by <hi>Reneri,</hi> but went up as
high as <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> for whom he now conceiv'd
an high eſteem. Theſe were but the fruits
of having converſation with Monſ. <hi>Des Cartes.</hi>
This Book at length came to appear. <hi>Regius</hi>
ſhewed himſelf the forwardeſt to read it; and
the eſteem he had conceived for Monſieur
<hi>Des Cartes,</hi> ſoon turned to a true paſſion.</p>
            <p>He ſatisfied of getting the Principles of
his new Philoſophy deeply imprinted on his
mind, the Eſſays of which he found to jump
with what <hi>Reneri</hi> had taught him before, and
adopting them in lieu of thoſe had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
taught him in the Schools; He betook
himſelf to digeſt and model them for the uſe
of others. He had a Colledge where he actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
read Philoſophy and Phyſick to ſome
private Students in the City: And that he
might not be diverted from the Study of M.
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> his Philoſophy, he thought fitting
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:52044:63"/>
to ſet it down in Sheets, and ſo diſtribute it
amongſt his Scholars under the name of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiology,
according as he comprehended it.</p>
            <p>The ſimpleneſs of the Hypotheſis, the pretty
concatenation of Principles and Reaſonings,
the neatneſs, clearneſs, and eaſineſs wherewith
he made them deduce the Truth from them,
did tranſport them to that degree, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
remaining within the bounds of ordinary
acknowledgment to a Maſter, they perceived
themſelves ſo extremely obliged, that they
fram'd a kind of a League amongſt themſelves
to lay their heads together to procure his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement,
and uſe their utmoſt to get him
ſome place, either in the Univerſity, or in the
Councel of the City: A little while after
there was a great talk of ſettling a new Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſorſhip
of Phyſick for <hi>Botanny</hi> &amp; <hi>Theory. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>
his Scholars, moſt of them Youths of good
Families, thought then that the occaſion they
ſought for was at hand, and they ſpared nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their Relations nor Friends to obtain the
plurality of Votes in the Senate in favour of
him. <hi>Regius</hi> had powerful Competitors, but
the approbation his Phyſiology gain'd, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with the difference that men obſerved
in the manner of arguing, that diſtinguiſhed
his Diſciples from thoſe of the Publick and
Vulgar Scholars, extorted belief that he muſt
have a particular Philoſophy, and that he muſt
needs be an excellent Maſter in the Art or
Method of Inſtructing. This was the buſineſs
that prevailed with the Magiſtrates to prefer
him before others worthy to fill the Chair;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:52044:63"/>
and ſo they cauſed all the Profeſſors of the
Univerſity, whoſe minds <hi>Reneri</hi> had diſpoſed,
willingly to receive him for their Collegue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Regius</hi> believed himſelf particularly obliged
to Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> for the ſucceſs of this
buſineſs, whoſe Philoſophy had produc'd in him
that deſert, that had made him carry it before
his Fellow-Candidates. He aſſumed the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
by his firſt Letter bearing date the 18th
of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> to give him many thanks for that
important Service he had render'd him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing of it. He conjur'd him next not to
forſake <hi>his own bandy-work,</hi> and not to refuſe
him the Aſſiſtances neceſſary to keep up this
new acquired Reputation; he promiſed on his
part to do whatſoever was within the ſphere
of his Activity, that he might deſerve the
quality of his Diſciple, which he preferr'd to
all the advantages of his Life; and that he
would tread in <hi>Reneri</hi>'s ſteps as cloſe as he
poſſibly could.</p>
            <p>To put himſelf forth with Impoſſeſſion of
the Priviledges and Rights annexed to this
Quality, he ſends him <hi>his Eſſays of Phyſick,</hi> that
he might examine and correct them with all
the ſeverity of a Maſter; and he demanded
of him all the Objections that had been lately
made againſt the <hi>Circulation of Blood,</hi> together
with his Anſwers.</p>

chief praiſe that <hi>Emilius</hi> gave to the illuſtrious
Defunct, which they reſpected as the principal
ſupport, and faireſt Ornament of this Infant
Univerſity, was, for that he ſhewed Courage
enough to pack off the Ancients, and free him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from their Authority, and that of the
Moderns too who preceded him, to the end
he might poſſeſs the Liberty that God hath
granted to our Reaſon, to govern and conduct
it ſelf in the reſearch of Truth, which is the
only Miſtreſs we are obliged to Court; This
was an Heroick reſolution incident only to
high-born Spirits of the firſt rank. But Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>des Cartes</hi> muſt needs be the Director of
this Enterprize, who firſt inſpired it into him,
as he did into ſome others who had cloſely
adhered to him from the very beginning of
his Retirement in <hi>Holland. Emilius</hi> extol'd
with wonderful Eloquence, the great Progreſs
<hi>Reneri</hi> had made in the knowledge of Nature,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:52044:65"/>
under a Leader of this Quality. He magnified
with the livelieſt Colours of Rhetorick, the
benefit both City and Univerſity had reap'd
from the diſpoſition of <hi>Reneri,</hi> that he was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
to reach there the Principles of true Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
which he pretended did remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to Mankind till <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his time.</p>
            <p>The Auditory ſeem'd perſwaded of it; and
the Magiſtrates after they had honoured this
fine diſcourſe with their Approbation, gave
order it ſhould be printed, and publickly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributed
under their Authority, as well to
honour the Memory of their Profeſſor, as to
demonſtrate convincing Proofs of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment
for the ſignal Service Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> had rendered in forming ſuch
a Diſciple. <hi>Emilius</hi> that had long ſought an
opportunity to gain Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his
Acquaintance, received, as a Piece of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
the Order that the Magiſtrates ſent him,
<hi>to make an Encomium upon him, and upon the
new Philoſophy</hi> in his Funeral Oration for-Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Reneri.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After he had ſpoke it, he ſent him a written
Copy of it with a Letter full fraught with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
and Eſteem, upon pretence that this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
perſonally relating to him, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy
having ordered the Publication of the
ſame, it was but convenient that he ſhould ſee
what ought to be corrected therein, before it
went to the Preſs. Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> was
put to the bluſh upon reading ſo many and
great <hi>Elogiums;</hi> but ſince he had nothing to
do to contradict the Judgment and Conduct
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:52044:66"/>
of the Chief Magiſtrate, he durſt not meddle
with it.</p>
            <p>Some time after, he gave out that he had
not ſuffer'd theſe <hi>Elogiums,</hi> but becauſe it was
not in his power to ſuppreſs them. For <hi>Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius</hi>
ſending him a Copy of Verſes with too
much Confidence that he had compoſed upon
the ſame Subject, to deſire to know how he
liked them; and demanding them again of him,
becauſe he had not kept a Copy of them, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring
to Print them: Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
ſought for an Excuſe for not ſending them
back; and he took his revenge as well as he
could by this Suppreſſion for offending his
Baſhfulneſs and Modeſty in Monſieur <hi>Reneri</hi>'s
Funeral Oration.</p>
            <p>The loſs which <hi>Regius</hi> in particular had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain'd

The good Qualities that he might challenge

Inſomuch, that being accuſtomed by a long

whatſoever was not comprehended within the

            <p>The reverence that was due to <hi>Reneri,</hi> had

to ſlacken his Career that he might not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonably
come to Daggers-drawing with his
Superiours; wherefore ſetting aſide what was
within the Verge of Philoſophy, againſt which
it was not ſafe nor becoming to ſhew his
teeth, he reduc'd his intent only to heap toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
what might any-ways relate to Divinity,
in the Diſcourſe and Method of Monſieur
<hi>Des Cartes;</hi> as the ſubject matter of his cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
endeavouring by this means to baniſh
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:52044:68"/>
his Philoſophy out of the Univerſity, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
to the Proteſtant Religion and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity
of the States of the United Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces.</p>
            <p>He began his Hoſtilities with ſome <hi>Theſeſes</hi>
he compoſed in <hi>June,</hi> An. 1639. concerning
Atheiſm, and for the obſerving ſome order in
the Productions of his ill-will, he refrain'd
from nominating at firſt daſh the perſon he
had a deſign upon, and contented himſelf only
to lay the foundation of his Calumny where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he thought he muſt load him, that he
might have his end, to ruin him.</p>
            <p>This Calumny, in which he hath ſtill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
ſince, conſiſted in making M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
paſs for an Atheiſt: and to the end that one
ſhould not be deceived in taking another for
him, he ſcattered up and down in his Theſeſes

               </note> and he perceived it behoved him to
practiſe diſſimulation if he meant to keep in
with him: that put him in mind to ſecure him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the Phyſick Chair more than hitherto
he had done, and to reſerve the principal Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs
of New Philoſophy for the Problems he
read upon certain days in the Week by the
by, out of the hours appointed for publick
Lectures; in which he ſeem'd to rely upon
the conſent of the Profeſſors, not excepting
<hi>Voetius,</hi> who had even been ſerviceable once
more in the Petitioning for this New Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="131" facs="tcp:52044:68"/>
But, altho' he left his Auditors to their
liberty of believing, or not believing Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blems;
yet did he not refuſe occaſions to
demonſtrate the ridiculouſneſs or weakneſs of
ancient Opinions. This Cunning way, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived
inſenſibly to deſtroy the Principles of
the vulgar Philoſophy in vogue in the Schools,
proved yet more dangerous to it, than his
open and Sincere manner of teaching <hi>Des
Cartes</hi> his Principles in his Lectures of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.
This is that which put his Colleagues
to their trumps, who conſerved ſome value
for that Philoſophy which had been taught
them; who thought it was very much for
them to grant <hi>Regius</hi> the Permiſſion to teach
the new Opinions together with the old.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Regius</hi> not ſubmitting enough (out of his
Writings and Lectures) to cape the meaning
and drift of Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His Indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</note> being of a
mild and moderate Spirit, adminiſtred a freſh
occaſion of diſcontent to his Colleagues, by a
piece of weakneſs that he ſhew'd in an Act of
Philoſophy on the 9th of <hi>July,</hi> kept under
Profeſſor <hi>Senguerdius,</hi> by one <hi>Florentius Schuyl,</hi>
who proved a notable Carteſian afterward, for
all that. The Opponent that diſputed, had
compos'd his Arguments according to the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
of the New Philoſophy, and he had
choſen the Nature and Properties of the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
for the ſubject of them—The Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent,
notwithſtanding otherwiſe well verſs'd
in his Dictates, and Papers of his Maſter,
ſeem'd a little gravelled; but the Profeſſor
interpoſing to bring him off, up ſtarts <hi>Regius,</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:52044:69"/>
and without reſpecting either the Aſſembly; or
Profeſſors Duty, interrupts him, very inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
inſults over him, and would fain have
adjudged the Victory to the Opponent, which
Civility and Cuſtom might have obliged him
to ſuffer the Reſpondent to bear away. This
Action which we have had an account of,
from none beſides his Enemies, did offend the
Profeſſors of the Univerſity in general, and
made them willing to hearken to what <hi>Voetius</hi>
could hint to them againſt the Innovations.</p>
            <p>The Exerciſes a few days after put an end
to this Theſis, and <hi>Regius</hi> writing to Monſieur
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> the 14th of <hi>July,</hi> when Vacation
begins, would be ſure to acquaint him what
he had done at the Act. He only gave him
to underſtand, <q>That he had finiſhed his <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Courſe</hi> of Medicine for that Year, that
he ſtill ſtrictly adhered to his Principles and

How tedious and how frequent ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
theſe Letters of this Zealous Diſciple were,
yet did he not grudge his time to Inſtruct
him; becauſe he thought he ſhould not be
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:52044:69"/>
ſorry for it as ill ſpent. The Importance of
the Queries and Difficulties he propounded
to him, hindered him to take care to put him
in a condition of eſtabliſhing his Principles.
Their main hinge was, of the difficulty of the
nature of Angels, upon the nature of man's
Souls, of its Union with the Body, of the Soul
of Beaſts and Plants, of Life, Motion of the
the Heart, and upon the Circulation of the
Blood.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> had brought this laſt
Queſtion into great requeſt amongſt the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plempius</hi> his ill Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</note>
and he had wonderfully eſtabliſh'd the
credit of <hi>Harvey</hi> upon this account, having
been baſely abuſed and decry'd by the Satyrs
of divers Phyſicians in the Low-Countries,
the moſt part ignorant, or fondly valuing
themſelves upon the ancient Maxims of their
Faculty: that which could be plauſibly brought
againſt this Opinion, was objected 18 Months
before to Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> by his Friend
<hi>Plempius,</hi> a Phyſician of <hi>Louvain.</hi> Now altho'
this laſt ſeem'd to remain ſatisfy'd with his
Anſwer, yet did he afterward an Action
unworthy of their Friendſhip; he thought fit
for the inhancing the ſplendour of his own
Reputation to mention in a Book that he was

               </gap> going to put out, what had paſs'd between
Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> and he, touching the two
Queſtions of the Motion of the Heart, and
of the Circulation of Blood; He, to this
effect, gave all the gloſs that was neceſſary
to the Objections he had made to him, but
when they came to the Anſwers to them
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:52044:70"/>
that he received, he was ſo far from behaving
himſelf towards Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> as a
Friend who deſerved to be reſpected, that
he was not ſo faithful to theſe Anſwers as
is requiſite even in Adverſaries that confu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

one another, and look upon one another as
Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Regius</hi> was exaſperated at ſuch unhandſome
Carriage, and having confronted his Book
with the Anſwers Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> had
made to his Objections, he could no longer
ſmother the indignation that made him ſnatch
up his Pen to ſignifie his reſentments to <hi>Des
Cartes.</hi> He ſet out the ingratitude and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful
dealing of <hi>Plempius</hi> in ſuch lively Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours,
that one cannot expreſs in any Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
as he ſpoke them, without running
into the like tranſports of Anger againſt ſuch
a dirty, ſmooty Behaviour. He ſays, That as
for the places where Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers
the moſt hidden Secrets of Nature,
wherein conſiſted the main ſtreſs of his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers;
<hi>Plempius</hi> hath been ſo malicious as to
play the Mute, or at leaſt to paſs by the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt
part of them: and as for thoſe which he
doth relate, he ſo maims them, that he quite
ſpoils the ſenſe of them. That in the place
where he treats of the Circulation of Blood,
he is content only barely to relate the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
as if no body had anſwered them;
altho' the Anſwers Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> made
to them were very convincing ones. That in
the place where Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> relates
ſeveral Cauſes, which being joyn'd together,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:52044:70"/>
produce the beating of the heart; <hi>Plempius</hi>
introduces but one of them, which is heat. If
Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> after he has alledg'd Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
neceſſary for the evincing a thing; add
thereto ſome others leſs convincing in order
to a great Illuſtration of the Point; <hi>Plempius</hi> is
ſo treacherous and unfaithful as to inſiſt only
upon this laſt Reaſon, as tho' it had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
for an Eſſential or Fundamental one;
and leaving you to ſuppoſe that this might be
the only one, that could have been alledged
by Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> he labours to make
him ridiculous, which he goes about to do in
places he doth not underſtand.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plempius</hi> hath now forgotten what formerly
he writ, that he did not believe one could be
able to charge Monſ. <hi>Des Cartes, of having ever
uttered any falſe thing, or but an idle trifle.</hi> But
if he thought good to revoke the Praiſes he
gave him, it was ſorry pittiful retraction to
blot them out with injuries. Monſ. <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
ſeem'd not at all concern'd at ſuch uncouth
behaviour, and was once of the mind only to
oppoſe them by ſilence. <hi>Regius</hi> did not judge
ſo; he reveng'd his Maſters Cauſe in ſuch a
manner, that probably made <hi>Plempius</hi> open his
Eyes; ſeeing he hath altered his Opinion about
the Circulation of Blood, to embrace that of
Monſ. <hi>Des Cartes.</hi>

that lately appear'd in <hi>Paris.</hi> This Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy
was, that a young Lad of Sixteen years
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:52044:71"/>
had Compos'd a Treatiſe of <hi>Coniques,</hi> that was
matter of aſtoniſhment to all the old Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians
that ever were ſhewn it. This
Youth was Son to Monſieur <hi>Paſcal,</hi> Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant
of Juſtice at <hi>Rouan:</hi> And men thought
it no piece of flattery to publiſh that he had
been more ſucceſsful than <hi>Apolonius</hi> in ſome
Points. Monſ. <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> that admired al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
nothing, diſſembling his purpoſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered,
that he did not think it ſuch an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable

could demonſtrate <hi>Coniques</hi> more eaſily than
<hi>Apolonius;</hi> but, that one might propoſe ſome
other things about <hi>Coniques,</hi> that a Child of
Sixteen would have much ado to reſolve.</p>
            <p>Not having a mind to refer himſelf to any
concerning the matter of fact, but to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
of his own Eyes; for <hi>Merſennus</hi> was
to ſend him a Copy of the Treatiſe; He had
not read the half of it, but he judged that
Monſieur <hi>des Argues</hi> had ſhare in Compoſing
it, upon pretence that he was there quoted:
Underſtanding after clearing of ſome doubts
touching the matter in hand, that there was
no likelihood that his friend Monſieur <hi>des
Argues</hi> had the leaſt hand in it; he rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
that Monſieur <hi>Paſcal</hi> the Father was
Author of it, than be perſwaded that a Boy
of Sixteen Years could be capable of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
ſuch a ſtrong Piece of Work. This
great Man's doubt proved much more glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to this Prodigy in Nature, than the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration

matter of fact.</p>
            <p>

His Incredulity was not only grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

another foundation ſtill, even the Project of

altho' they ſee his four Books of <hi>Coniques</hi> come

the introducing of Novelties, or any Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
contrary to the Statutes of the Univerſity:
The buſineſs was ſomething Equivocal. This
induc'd Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> to unravel it, and
to draw up an Explanation of the Curator's
Orders in form of an Anſwer. M. <hi>Vander
Hoolck,</hi> one of the principal Magiſtrates of the

found this Anſwer very ingenious and
judicious: and he was wonderfully pleaſed
with M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his deſign of letting <hi>Regius</hi>
continue in his way of Reading Lectures in

his heat, and reform what ſhould be too bold
and adventurous in his Opinions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Regius</hi> was not the only Man of his Diſciples

day by day new ones, who were no leſs

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:52044:75"/>
after Natural Truths; but they came not to
our Knowledge, by reaſon of the indifference
they ſhewed to make themſelves known to
any other beſides Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes.</hi> 'Tis
to one of theſe newly admitted that we are
beholden, for the explanation of his Sentiment
touching the Seat of the Soul in the Brain;
which he confin'd to the <hi>Glandula Penialis,</hi>
called <hi>Conarion;</hi> the ſame unknown Perſon,
one of no mean quality, declared to him at

the ſubſtance of the Body, which is reſembled
to the folds that remain in a Sheet of Paper,
after it hath been once folded.</p>
            <p>It was about this time that Monſieur <hi>Des

his knowledge, for ſettling him and Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Mydorge</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> under the protection
and by the Munificence of King <hi>Charles</hi> the
Firſt; Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> did not appear
backward, eſpecially conſidering what they
had aſſured him, <hi>That the King was a Catholick
in his heart.</hi> The Promoter of this Deſign
was an Engliſh Lord, named <hi>Charles Cavendiſh</hi>
alias <hi>Candiſh,</hi> Brother to the Duke of <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi>
both of them acquainted with our Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher.
<hi>Candiſh</hi> was an excellent Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician;
he became moreover deſperately in
love with Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.
He look'd upon this Method as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable
means to bring Mathematicks to
their perfection; one may judge by that, what joy
poſſeſs'd him to perceive <hi>Des Cartes</hi> make no
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:52044:76"/>
Objections, nor hindrances againſt the deſigns
of his Settlement in <hi>England.</hi> Monſieur <hi>My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorge,</hi>
ty'd by the heels in <hi>Paris</hi> by reaſon of
his Family, was harder to move. King <hi>Charles</hi>
might have, peradventure removed all his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles
by the goodneſs he had to promiſe
Monſieur <hi>Candiſh</hi> to make ample Proviſion,
and take care for all. But the beginning of
the Troubles of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> making him
and Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> to apprehend leſt theſe
vaſt Sums that the King would ſet apart for
Natural Experiments, might be laid out in the
Expences of the War, and leſt they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
might be deprived of that repoſe they
flatter'd them withal, together with other
Effects of that Prince's Clemency: they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd,
one in <hi>Holland,</hi> the other in <hi>Paris;</hi>
and continued the exerciſe of their Friendſhip
with Mr. <hi>Candiſh</hi> as before.</p>
            <p>The Amity Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> entertain'd
with Monſieur <hi>Salmaſius,</hi>
               <note place="margin">His ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſius.</hi>
               </note> would have been
no leſs to his Advantage; if he had profeſs'd
Philoſophy or Mathematicks. This defect
nevertheleſs did not hinder him from being
reckoned amongſt the <hi>Carteſians,</hi> and he wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
embrac'd Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
The Correſpondence between them,
was not confined to the Exerciſes of Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks
and Philoſophy alone;<note place="margin">The ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of <hi>Salmaſius.</hi>
               </note> but as it was
a piece of fatality that attended thoſe that
were acquainted with <hi>Salmaſius,</hi> and deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
to Experience his ill Conditions: as
good luck would have it, Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
was involved in their deſtiny, leſt detraction

ſome time or other ſhould reckon him a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
ſome of Monſieur <hi>Salmaſius</hi> his Friends,
who were of ſuch a low ſpirit, as to prize the
faults of this learned Man, or ſo great Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
as to adore him. It is true, he never
had but one occaſion in all his life to incur
his diſpleaſure, but it was but a trivial occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion:
and he was beholden to his own Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that made him almoſt ever have an
averſion from converſing with him, even
when he ſtaid at <hi>Leiden,</hi> where <hi>Salmaſius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided.
I ſay, a trivial occaſion, but it ſhould
never have been an occaſion to a juſt equitable
Perſon to fret himſelf. Monſieur <hi>Salmaſius</hi>
ſuſpected Monſ. <hi>Des Cartes</hi> a Friend to <hi>Heinſius,</hi>
whom he did not love. It was beſides a piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
mean Jealouſie, and much below a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and a Scholar. But now this ſuſpicion of
his was ill grounded, ſeeing Monſieur <hi>Des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
had never in all his life ſpoken to <hi>Heinſius,</hi>
and altho' a Man well deſerving, and of great
account in the Univerſity of <hi>Leiden,</hi> by reaſon
of his Employ and Learning, yet had he never
ſo much as interchanged a word with him.
Nay, and what is more, <q>He could nto be ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
that <hi>Heinſius</hi> could not abide him for
a long time, becauſe he was Mr. <hi>Balzac</hi>'s
Friend who had cenſured his Tragedy of
<hi>Herod.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>X. Yet the Conſequences of M. <hi>Salmaſius</hi> his
ill humour ſignified in reſpect of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences
of a bad Buſineſs,<note place="margin">He falls out with the Jeſuits.</note> that had like to have

All things as to his Philoſophy ſeem'd to ſmile

               </note> this Conduct was only
the fulfilling of the Requeſts to the Jeſuits, that

them (for the uſe of his Scholars) into
the Theſes or Propoſitions defended the 30th
of <hi>June</hi> and 2d of <hi>July,</hi> by one <hi>Charles Potier,</hi>
who ſome while after turn'd <hi>Carteſian,</hi> maugre
his former Impreſſions.</p>
            <p>Father <hi>Merſennus,</hi> not content to defend his
Friend's opinions againſt the Scholar and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,
ſent him an Extract of the Poſition that
refer'd to him, together with the <hi>Preamble</hi> or
Preliminary Diſcourſe compoſed by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor
for the opening of the Diſpute, becauſe
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:52044:77"/>
it was point-blank againſt him; ſignifying by
the by, that it was the Profeſſor himſelf that
ſent it him, by him.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> having forgotten the
manner of Comportment in Colledges,<note place="margin">The Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of the Colledge in Diſputes.</note> ſeeing
the Preliminary Diſcourſe and the Points of
the Theſis, imagined they deſign'd to ſet upon
him publickly; he thought that the Jeſuits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of giving him notice before hand of his
Faults, did ſtudy to expoſe him to the laughter
of the greateſt Wits of <hi>Paris;</hi> that made him
loſe the unconcernedneſs he had declared upon
ſo many occaſions for whatſoever paſs'd to his
Prejudice: And he was vext to the purpoſe,
when he ſaw that the Profeſſor, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of Compoſing a Subject of Diſputation
for his Scholars, had father'd upon him cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Opinions that he was not of, that he might
the more eaſily confute them. Perhaps he did
wrong not to conſider, that on ſuch like occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
the Maſters are ſometimes forc'd to
forge Chimera's to their Scholars to accuſtom
them to wrangle; that, as for what is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
in theſe Publick Acts, is but a ſport
and divertiſement of Mind; that what is
there ſpoken is of little conſequence againſt
the truth of an Author's Opinions that they
there oppoſe; that according to the Cuſtom
of the Schools, the Maſter's and Reſpondent's
Honours are concern'd to appear at leaſt to
come off victorious in the Diſputation; that
theſe petty Triumphs laſt but a Day, and
that the Applauſes concern neither the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
nor his Opinions, but only the Scholar;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:52044:78"/>
whom they Applaud, when he hath but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
an Argument, and reſponded (well or
ill) ſuitable to the Dictates and Lectures of
his Mr.</p>
            <p>The Union that he ſuppoſed to be amongſt
the Members of the Company of Jeſus,<note place="margin">He declares War with the Jeſuits.</note> made
him conclude from the Example of Father
<hi>Bourdin,</hi> that he had pull'd an old Houſe over
his head, and that he ſhould have all the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits
upon his back, and repreſented juſt then
this Society as a formidable Army that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
towards him. He was not a whi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
daunted nor diſcompoſed for all that, but
plucking up his Courage, he reſolved to march
alone, againſt them all, without ſtaying to
Combat, either Father <hi>Bourdin,</hi> or any other
in particular.</p>
            <p>In order to this ſtrange reſolution, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
himſelf to the Father Rector of the
Colledge of <hi>Clermont,</hi> to whom he writ in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
a Letter dated 22 <hi>July,</hi> very pithy, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
and full of reſpect. He begged of him
to interpoſe his Authority to engage the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of the Society to diſcloſe to him once
for all what they had to find fault with in his
Works, to the end he might either Correct
himſelf or Anſwer them; This was a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Declaration of War againſt the Jeſuits in
his Name, which he judged fit to intruſt with
ſome wiſe diſcreet Perſon; in order here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto,
he pitcht upon his Friend Monſieur
<hi>Mydorge,</hi> charging him to go deliver it imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
to the Rector, and let him underſtand
that there was no raſhneſs in making his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:52044:78"/>
directly to his Reverence; ſince Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Bourdin</hi> had commenced a formal War,
not by his Theſis, which he ſhould take no
further notice of; but by a <hi>Velitation</hi> or Skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh
which he diſpatched to him ſince.</p>
            <p>He anſwered this Velitation, expecting the
Effect of his Letter to the Rector, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it, not from M. <hi>Mydorge</hi> his hands, who
was afraid to draw the Tempeſt upon his
Friend by this proceeding, but by the hands
of Father <hi>Merſennus,</hi> who was not ſo ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
when the buſineſs was to foment differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
amongſt the Learned, and breed Quarrels
conducing to the advancement of Sciences.</p>
            <p>XI. The Rector ſeem'd not a little ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the Reaſons and real Sentiments of
Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes;</hi>
               <note place="margin">A Perſonal Quarrel with Fath. <hi>Bourdin.</hi>
               </note> but he did not believe
that the Society was bound to concern it ſelf
in a difference wherein it was not a party con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd.
He thought it ſufficient to permit
Father <hi>Bourdin</hi> to decide his Controverſie in
perſon, as well as he could with him, and
inſtead of anſwering his Letter, he order'd
this Father to Anſwer it himſelf, and to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a reaſon of his Proceedings to Monſieur
<hi>Des Cartes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Father <hi>Bourdin</hi> declared poſitively to him in
his Letter, <q>That he had not, nor ſhould ever
undertake a particular War againſt his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions.</q>
Yet he promiſed him to ſend him
his Treatiſe within a Week; that is, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
he made uſe of not to approve his Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents.
The term of eight days, at the end
of which Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> expected theſe
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:52044:79"/>
Treatiſes, being expired over and over, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to deſpair of them, when he received
ſome Letters from ſome other Fathers of the
Society, by which they demanded of him <hi>Six
Months delay longer.</hi> He made no queſtion
but this was a Stratagem to Correct theſe
Writings at leiſure, and to put them in ſuch
a condition no longer to fear his cenſure. He
conjectured by theſe Fathers Letters, that
notwithſtanding the aſſurances they had given
him of a pure perſonal Quarrel with Father
<hi>Bourdin,</hi> yet that he was going to detach from
the main Body of the Society, a powerful
Party of Jeſuits againſt him, to back their
Fellow-Collegian.</p>
            <p>Knowing that their chief Strength conſiſted
in the Art of Logick,<note place="margin">He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares for the Jeſuits.</note> of which they perform
many Exerciſes in the Society, to make them
handle their Arms the better in their Diſputes
againſt all ſorts of Adverſaries, he thought
likewiſe he was to look about him, and have
recourſe to Scholaſtick Arms, which, he
thought he had laid aſide this many years, not
ſo much as ever dreaming he ſhould have any
more occaſion for them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He communicated his purpoſe to Father</hi>
Merſennus, <hi>who expected him in</hi> Paris <hi>towards
the end of this Year, and he writ to him
about it in theſe terms:</hi> I ſhall not yet take
my Journey this Winter; for, being I am to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Objections of the Jeſuits within four or
five Months; I believe I muſt be in a poſture
ready to expect them; in the interim, I have a
great deſire, a little to peruſe their Philoſophy
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:52044:79"/>
(which I have not done this Twenty Years) on purpoſe
to ſee if I like it better now, than I did heretofore.
To this effect, I beſeech you to ſend me the Names
of the Authors who have writ a Body of Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy,
which are moſt followed amongſt the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits,
and whether or no they may have any new
ones. I remember none but <hi>Collegium Conim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bricenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He deſired him alſo to inform him,<note place="margin">He under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to confute the School-Philoſophy</note> if they
had not compiled ſome Abridgment or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendium</hi>
of all Philoſophy of the Schools that
was much read; (to ſpare him the labour of
turning over the Schoolmen;) ſuch a one as
that of <hi>Euſtachius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Father <hi>Merſennus</hi> could tell him of none
but <hi>de Raconie,</hi> which was not ſo fit for his
purpoſe as <hi>Euſtachius;</hi> but he forceably urged
and exhorted him, not to neglect the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
of the Schools, ſuch as was at that
time taught in the Colledge, ſuppoſing that
the time of Sacrificing of it to truth, was
come; letting him underſtand by the way
that he was the only man, from whom the
Lovers of Truth and Wiſdom expected this
piece of Service.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> writ back to him the
Eleventh of <hi>November,</hi> That he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
the School-Philoſophy ſo hard to be
confuted, becauſe of the diverſity of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
that it contains; He declared to him at
the ſame time the aims he had upon Philoſophy
in reference to that of the Schools.</p>
            <p>His intent was to write in order, a whole
courſe of Philoſophy in the nature of Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:52044:80"/>
or without any ſuperfluities of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe;
he would put down only all his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions,
with all the Reaſons, from whence
he deduc'd them; which he hoped to be able
to do in few words. In the ſame Book, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his Project, he did get a courſe of
Vulgar Philoſophy printed, ſuch an one as
that of <hi>Euſtachius,</hi> with his Notes at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
end of each Queſtion, where he intended
to add the various Opinions of Authors, and
what a man was to believe of them all accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to him. In a word, he put us in hopes
(for to ſerve for a Conluſion to his Work)
that he would make a Parallel or Compariſon
of two Philoſophies, that is to ſay, of his own;
and that of others. He was only ſollicitous
to know if <hi>Euſtachius</hi> were yet alive; becauſe
having no deſign, neither on his Perſon, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
Writings in particular, he had a deſire to keep
a fair Correſpondence with him; and uſe all
ſort of Civilities towards him. As for the
<hi>Collegium Conimbricenſe</hi> (i. e. the Courſes of
Philoſophy of the Jeſuits of <hi>Conimbra</hi> in <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi>)
in his Opinion they were too long. But
he could have wiſht they had writ as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctly
as <hi>Euſtachius;</hi> becauſe having to do
with the Jeſuits, he ſhould have preferr'd their
courſe to all others.</p>
            <p>XII. This Year proved fatal to our Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher
by the loſs,<note place="margin">The Death of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and Daughter.</note> not only of three or four
of his Friends, Mathematicians, or Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
but eſpecially of two Perſons the dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
to him in all the World, <hi>viz.</hi> his Daughter
<hi>Francina,</hi> and his Father, Dean of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:52044:80"/>
of <hi>Britain,</hi> who departed this Life in
<hi>October,</hi> 78 years of Age.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Francina</hi> died on the 7th of <hi>September</hi> at
<hi>Amersford,</hi> only 5 years of Age. He pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
own'd her for his Daughter, altho' we
cannot learn who her Mother was, having not
any proof of his being Married; He lamented
her Death with that paſſionate affection that
forc'd him to Experience, that true Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
cannot ſtifle Natural Affection. The
Sorrow and Grief that over-whelm'd him for
this loſs, makes us apt to believe ſhe was his
only Child: But thoſe that ſpeak ill of him,
have not ſtuck to father more upon him.
The Calumny, altho' ſupported by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
and Writings of a grave Miniſter
amongſt the Reformed at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> ſeem'd to
him ſo ill-grounded, that he only laught at
it; and anſwer'd his Enemy that caſt it in his
teeth, that not having made a Vow of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtity,
and not being exempt from Humane
Frailties; he ſhould make no ſcruple at all to
own them before all the World, if he had
any; but albeit he had none; yet he agreed
not to paſs for a great Saint, with a Miniſter
that had no good opinion of the Gift of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency
in the Eccleſiaſticks of the Roman
Church, who live in Celibacy.</p>
            <p>He ſtaid not long to repair the breach that
was made in integrity of his life, wherewith
he honoured his ſolitude, and the profeſſion
of his Philoſophy, and reſtor'd his Celibacy
to its priſtin perfection, ever before he had
acquired the Name of Father. Upon the
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:52044:81"/>
whole, the Publick had never come to the
knowledge of this humbling Circumſtance o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Fellow, good for nothing but to trouble the
Schools; as for his <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> he would
have him paſs for an Enemy of the Proteſtant
Religion, a Spy ſent out of <hi>France</hi> againſt the
Intereſt of the United Provinces: not judging
the Writers of his Religion in his own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try

good to find out ſome amongſt the Catholicks,

ſuch, it was neceſſary to change his Language.

had to deal with a common Enemy, and in

wherein the Catholicks were no leſs intereſted

            <p>In <hi>the firſt</hi> he propounds the Reaſons why we
may doubt of all things in general, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of material things, until ſuch time as we
have eſtabliſhed a better foundation in Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences
than thoſe we have had hitherto: He
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>akes it appear that the advantage of this
general doubt conſiſteth in delivering us from
all ſorts of prejudices to looſen our Minds
from Senſe, and ſo to bring it about that we
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:52044:84"/>
cannot any longer doubt of the things which,
we ſhall afterwards know and acknowledge
to be true.</p>
            <p>In <hi>the ſecond</hi> he demonſtrates that the Soul
making uſe of its own liberty in ſuppoſing that
the things of whoſe Exiſtence there may ariſe
the leaſt doubt, do not exiſt at all, in effect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
doth acknowledge that it is impoſſible but
that at the ſame time it exiſts it ſelf; which
ſerves to make it diſtinguiſh the things that
belong to it, from thoſe that belong to the
Body.</p>
            <p>In <hi>the third</hi> he produceth and diſplays the
beſt Argument he hath for the Exiſtence of a
God, without uſing any compariſon dra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
from corporeal things.</p>
            <p>In <hi>the fourth</hi> he proves that all things we
have a clear and diſtinct notion of, are true; he
there explains alſo the nature of the Errour
that is in the Judgment, and the diſcerning of
true from falſe.</p>
            <p>In <hi>the fifth</hi> he explains the nature of a Body
in general; he doth there likewiſe demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
the Exiſtence of God in a new manner;
and he makes appear that the certitude of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations

knowledge of God.</p>
            <p>In <hi>the ſixth</hi> he makes a difference between
the action of the underſtanding, and that of
the imagination. He there evidently ſhews
that the Soul of Man is really diſtinct from
the Body, and that nevertheleſs it is ſo nearly
joyn'd to it, that it compoſeth as it were but
the ſame thing with it. He explains alſo all

his power to ſtart ſome from his Anſwer to
the <hi>firſt Objections</hi> which he had conveyed to
him, with a deſign to have him to examine

ſeem'd to believe that theſe <hi>ſeveral Objections</hi>
had been made by perſons ſincere and honeſt,
and perſwaded of the ſolidity of his Principles,
and drew up an exact Anſwer to them. Now,
for as much as the Authors of theſe Objections-had
ſignified by the Pen of Father <hi>Merſennus,</hi>
that it would be very proper and uſeful, if,

he had made him a propoſition ſo agreeable to

therefore accompanied his Anſwer for their
ſatisfaction, with another Writing containing
<hi>the reaſon for proving that there is a God, and the

Body, couched after a Geometrical manner.</hi>

<hi>Des Cartes,</hi> accompanied them with a
word or two in behalf of his Friend, to the

and might know what kind of Philoſophy it
was, whereof he made Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> overjoy'd to learn that
the number of true Philoſophers was increaſed
by ſuch an ingenious perſon as M. <hi>Hobbes,</hi> had
a mind to ſtudy the Genius of the man in his
Objections; but he found them not proper to
let him judge of his Solidity and Profound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
He inſerted into the very Body of theſe
Objections, the Anſwer he made to each Point.
This is what we exhibit under the title of

Reply, he begg'd of Father <hi>Merſennus</hi> either to
keep it to himſelf, or to diſperſe it at diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that it might not be diſcover'd by M. <hi>Hobs,</hi>
nor no body elſe, that it came farther, than
from the Convent of Minims in <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He ſignified withal to this Father, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
that induc'd him to have no more to do
with this Engliſh Philoſopher, that he might
preſerve his Commerce for thoſe Friends
who love one another without Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He gave him a freſh account of what
he judged of this Man's Intellect, which he
look'd upon as very obſtinate, and dangerous
in its affecting ſingularity, altho' it might
not be indued with an exactneſs fit for
judging aright, nor with any ſtrength for
arguing.</p>
            <p>IV. In the whole Society of the <hi>Sorbonne,</hi>
there was not found one Cenſor of Monſieur
<hi>Des Cartes,</hi> notwithſtanding the great pains
Monſieur <hi>Gibeuf</hi> and Father <hi>Merſennus</hi> were at
to procure ſome; we muſt except one young
Doctor or Licenciate, who having heretofore
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:52044:87"/>
read the Eſſay of the Method of our Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
with no ſmall delight, did acquieſce
in Father <hi>Merſennus</hi> his deſire, hoping to meet
with the like pleaſure in the reading of the
Meditations; This Doctor was the famous
Monſieur <hi>Arnaud,</hi> at that time near 29 years
of Age, not being able to obtain of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to peruſe it Gratis without coſting him
ſome Reflections, he thought himſelf obliged
to act two Parts in the <hi>Examen</hi> they required
of him; At firſt, he appear'd like a Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher,
to repreſent the principal Difficulties
that might be objected againſt Monſieur <hi>Des
Cartes,</hi> touching thoſe two grand Queſtions;
concerning the Nature of our Soul and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
of God. Then again, he acted the part
of a Divine, to take notice of the things that
he judged apt to offend ears accuſtomed to the
uſual Expreſſions of his Theology.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> had never yet any more
rational, or more able Adverſary than this
young Doctor, who not taking up with ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
himſelf very Profound in all ſorts of
Knowledge, made a perfect Geometrical Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
to reign in all his Argumentations; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of miſpending his time in admiring him;
he ſets all his Wits on work to Anſwer him;
which troubled him more, and put him harder
to it, becauſe he was to ſatisfie a Spirit upon
which it was impoſſible to impoſe, and that
the buſineſs was to ſolve withal certain moſt
ſolid and moſt ſublimely propounded Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:52044:87"/>
He ſent back word to Father <hi>Merſennus,</hi>
that he could not have deſired a more quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

penetrating, nor yet a more fair and

               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ity,
that he could ſcarce imagine that it was

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n Adverſary that writ againſt him: But that
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e had examined what he had oppoſed with
ſo much diligence, that he could wiſh nothing
might have eſcaped him. And that his lively
penetrating manner of urging, and puſhing
things that he could yield his Approbation to,
made him confident that he was void of the
the complaiſance to diſſemble with him.</p>
            <p>He ſent his Anſwer to Father <hi>Merſennus</hi>
upon <hi>Eaſter-Day,</hi> with many thanks to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Arnaud,</hi> for two friendly offices he had
rendered him by writing againſt him; the
firſt was for having propoſed the Reaſons of
his Book, in ſuch a manner, that he ſeem'd to
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e afraid leſt others ſhould not find them
ſufficiently ſtrong and convincing. The other
was for having fortify'd him with no ſmall
Succours in backing him with the Authority
of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> whoſe Philoſophy had the
ſame Principle as his, for its Baſis and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter.</p>
            <p>Having a pretty while weighed the force
of Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Arguments about Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
he judged, that endeavouring to ſolve
thoſe which reſpect <hi>the Nature of the Soul or
Humane Spirit,</hi> it behooved him to alter his
Method, fearing he might not be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
the force of thoſe, he had propounded to
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:52044:88"/>
him touching <hi>the Exiſtence of God.</hi> That's the
reaſon why, inſtead of taking upon him to
bear up againſt all his Efforts, as hitherto he
did, he would imitate thoſe who are to defend
themſelves againſt an Adverſary that hath the
advantage, and ſtudied nothing more tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
cunningly and skilfully to parry his blows
rather than expoſe himſelf down-right to the
violence of them.</p>
            <p>When he was as far as the Anſwer that he
was to make to the Difficulties that might
baffle, and non-plus Divines, he declared,
<q>That he oppoſed Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi>'s firſt
Reaſons (concerning the Humane Soul) that
he had labour'd to elude the <hi>ſecond Reaſons</hi>
concerning the Exiſtence of God) but that
he had done his beſt into <hi>the third,</hi> except to
the laſt concerning the Euchariſt; to which
he undertook to anſwer.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> gave Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
ſeveral Advices as important as judicious to
obviate that wrangling that might be fear'd
in ill-diſpoſed Minds. Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
deſiring to demonſtrate the <hi>deference</hi> he had to
his Judgment, and eſteem for his Counſels,
ſent to Father <hi>Merſennus,</hi> the Places or Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
by themſelves, ſeparate from his Anſwer,
which this young Doctor judged convenient
to run over again, and alter in his Meditations.
He deſir'd the Doctor to ſet down the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
or Corrections in the very Text of his
Work, by ſeparate By-marks like Parenthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,
to ſhew how he deſir'd to be inſtructed by
the advice of another, without aiming to
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:52044:88"/>
aſcribe the Glory of it to himſelf, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
by ſuch a generous Modeſty, all his Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miners;
nay, and his Antagoniſts too, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford
him the like advice, in hopes of having
the ſame Juſtice done them.</p>
            <p>He wiſht Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> might ſee his
Anſwer, that he might paſs his judgment of
it, and that he might communicate to him
his replies, or give him new advice; but
we heard no more of it: And Monſieur <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naud</hi>
ſignified to Father <hi>Merſennus,</hi> that he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
fully ſatisfied. He added, That he
himſelf held, and openly maintain'd the very
ſame Philoſophy in part, that it had been
ſtifly oppoſed in a full Congregation by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Learned Perſons, but that it could not
be beat down, nor ſo much as ſtagger'd.</p>
            <p>This diſpoſition begot in Monſieur <hi>Des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
a Prejudice for his Philoſophy ſo much the
more advantageous,<note place="margin">The eſteem M. <hi>Des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> had for M. <hi>Arnaud.</hi>
               </note> as he judged this Doctor
an Adverſary leſs capable of Miſtakes in what
he knew, and leſs diſſimulation in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour.
He did not ſtick ſince to acquaint
the Fathers of the Oratory, that as young a
Doctor as Monſieur <hi>Arnaud</hi> was, yet did he
eſteem his Judgment more, than, <hi>that,</hi> of half
of the Old ones of the whole Faculty.</p>
            <p>Of all the Objections that were made
againſt his Meditations, there was not one of
them to whom the Publick beſtowed more
honour than to thoſe of the young Doctor,
and M. <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> who judged them prefera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to all the reſt, was not aſhamed to honour
himſelf particularly by it, as a new ſupport
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:52044:89"/>
for his Philoſophy. It was not his fault that
he did not hold up this growing acquaintance,
and amicable correſpondence with a Friend
of that importance. But Monſieur <hi>Arnaud,</hi>
notwithſtanding a great Philoſopher and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Geometrician; had at that time ſo
much dedicated his time to Theology, that
there was left him but a very ſmall Portion
of it for exerciſes of Humanity, or ſtudy of
Claſſick Authors: Inſomuch that they had a
Kindneſs one for another ſince, without much
Communication; yet nevertheleſs, Monſieur
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> expreſs'd ſo much ſympathy for
him, that he had cauſe to fear that Monſieur
<hi>Arnaud</hi>'s Enemies were his alſo.</p>
            <p>V. Beſides the Objections of Monſ. <hi>Hobbes</hi>
and Monſieur <hi>Arnaud,</hi>

Cronies; yet their amity never proceeded to
the degree of Friends, loving one another,
without ever diſcovering, or reproving what
is amiſs in one another. Whatſoever it was at
the beginning, Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> always pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
it in an equal poiſe: but now as for
Monſ. <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> it was not ſo with him, ſince
our Philoſopher's Edition of his Treatiſe of
Meteors.<note place="margin">The origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal cauſe of the falling out of M. <hi>Gaſſend.</hi> and M. <hi>Des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes.</hi>
               </note> Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> had not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in this Treaty the Phenomina of <hi>Parhelia's,</hi>
or Mock-Suns that appeared at <hi>Rome.</hi> An. 1629.
of which Monſieur <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> had compoſed a
Diſſertation. But his ſilence bred the occaſion
of being vext at him, and ſhewing a great deal
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:52044:89"/>
of indifference for him, who took it very ill
that Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> ſhould not make
the leaſt mention of him upon this occaſion.</p>
            <p>This ill diſpoſition of Mind in M. <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi>
attended with a ſecret Jealouſie, which the
reputation or deſigns of our Philoſopher begot
in him, was a ſoveraign Preſervative againſt
his natural ſweet diſpoſition and mildneſs,
that one might have fear'd he would have
uſed in his Objections againſt the Metaphyſical
Meditations, where Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> needed
all the ſeverity of the moſt able Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
He was very careful to acquit himſelf
handſomly of the Confutation he had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken;
yet towards the Concluſion, taking
up his wonted Complaiſance that he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to ſuſpend awhile, in the Body of the
Writing, he proteſted that his chief deſign
in Writing againſt Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> was
nothing but maintain himſelf in the honour of
his friendſhip. He added moreover, That if
any thing too rude had eſcaped his Pen, he
would diſown it upon the ſpot; and gave his
conſent, that whatſoever might diſpleaſe Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Des Cartes,</hi> ſhould be razed out of his
Writing.</p>
            <p>His Civilities did not tend to ſo good an
end. He writ alſo a particular Letter full of
Commendation, not only of Monſieur <hi>Des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
great parts; but alſo of the that very Work
he undertook to Animadvert upon. But what
he adds afterwards touching the neceſſity Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Merſennus</hi> had driven him to ſend him his
doubts and ſcruples, touching his pretended
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:52044:90"/>
Incapacity, touching the weakneſs of his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,
was the product of ſuch a cunning
Diſſimulation, and ſo near akin to Modeſty,
that many did not ſtick to prefer them to the
plain and auſtere ſincerity of Monſieur <hi>Des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes,</hi>
and to diſapprove that blunt diſobliging
downrightneſs of the latter, wherewith he
thought fit to anſwer him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This affected Language of M.</hi> Gaſſendus, <hi>was
only for Monſieur</hi> Des Cartes; <hi>he changed his
note for thoſe whom he handled without Diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation;
ſuch as M.</hi> Daillé <hi>in</hi> France, <hi>and
M.</hi> Rivet <hi>in</hi> Holland, <hi>where he was not aſhamed
to confeſs to the laſt,</hi> That he had not ſo ſtrictly
examined Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> his Metaphyſicks,
but only becauſe he had not received from him
all thoſe Civilities that he expected upon a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

            <p>Yet altho' his revenge was groundleſs, and

altho' he was pleas'd to be perſwaded that he
had not ſo much made uſe of the Reaſons of

who outwardly was pacified by the ſubmiſſion

upon pretence that in ſome places of his
laſt Theſes he had let fall ſome Expreſſions,
different from the common Language of the
Schools, that he had not ſhewn him.</p>
            <p>This Proteſtant Miniſter, (having no more
to expect from <hi>Merſennus</hi>) who, (for all he
expected a Conſutation from him) ſent him
nothing but a grave Reprimand for the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice

Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> in two places, firſt of all
by Diſpute, ſetting his Theſes againſt thoſe
of <hi>Regius;</hi> and then again by his Pen, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing

ordered <hi>Stratenus</hi> Profeſſor in Phyſick, and

refute all theſe Novel Opinions in all the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Acts of <hi>November</hi> and <hi>December.</hi> As for
himſelf, he reſerved the care to oppoſe in the

from thence to have him declared an Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick,

Faculty of Theology; that is to ſay, of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
his two Colleagues <hi>Carolus Dematius</hi> and

ſhould abſtain from the Lectures of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi>
as from Dogma's and Tenets pernicious
to Religion. Then he cauſes ſome Theſis to
be Printed, which were to be maintain'd in

and againſt the Opinion that diſallows <hi>Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial

beforehand by the two other Profeſſors in
Divinity, and by all Divines whatſoever, who
were either Miniſters or Preachers in the
City, and then to depute ſome Perſons to the

Magiſtracy, to give them notice that <hi>Regius</hi>
ſhould be condemned by a Conſiſtory or Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Aſſembly; to the end, that the
Magiſtracy might not lawfully diſpenſe with
his not being removed from the Chair.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Regius</hi> having had an inkling of what they
were contriving againſt him, goes preſently

one of the Conſuls that protected him, and

who thought, that if his Anſwer did no
good to the Publick, yet it would at leaſt be
of great uſe to his Scholars. M. <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
being concern'd at his obſtinacy, thought it
neceſſary to make uſe of ſome Condeſcenſion
not to diſcourage him, and having corrected
his Writings upon his reiterated Intreaties,
he drew up a new Project of an Anſwer full
of obliging Expreſſions, and Praiſes of <hi>Voetius,</hi>
he flouriſhed with <hi>formula's</hi> of reſpect for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,

ſhould ſeize all the Copies of them;
which making the Book more ſcarce, and to

the Rector, that having got on his ſide
the greateſt part of the Profeſſors of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,
and Senators of the City Counſel, he
obtain'd a Decree from the Magiſtrates, and
after that a Judgment of the Univerſity againſt
the New Philoſophy; ſtrictly to charge and
forbid <hi>Regius</hi> not to read or teach publickly
any thing but Phyſick or Medicine, and not to
hold any private Conferences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Regius</hi> diſpatcht all theſe Proceedings to
Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> the 31ſt of <hi>March</hi> 1642;
ſending him the Decree of the Magiſtrates
of the 15th of the ſaid Month, together with
the Judgment and Definitive Sentence of the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:52044:95"/>
Univerſity, and the Theſes of young <hi>Voetius</hi>
the Rector's Son. Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> ſent
him word back again, That as for the Theſes
they might be waved, nay, and the Judgment
of the Univerſity too, being an Act both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to the due Courſe of Law, and irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar:
But as for the Decree of the Magiſtrate,
it was not the ſame caſe; for the Senate had
iſſued it out only to be freed from the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities
of <hi>Voetius</hi> and his Colleagues; he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed
him to ſtick cloſe to the Decree accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

            <p>Notwithſtanding, <hi>Voetius</hi> ill-ſatisfied at theſe

            <p>The Jeſuites ſeemed and appear'd ſomewhat

them were content to like his Principles and
Reaſonings, or to praiſe his good Intentions
and Endeavours without going any further.
Others there were, who without more adoe,
embraced his Philoſophy, and declared that
they were followers of the ſame. No man
ever went farther than Father <hi>Vatier,</hi> who
told him in plain terms, that he did wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully,
approve of whatſoever he had writ, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Age and Diſputes had humanized more than

ſomething to the report of his reputation, and
yield to the delightſomneſs of his abode, is not

being a man of few words, ſpoil'd his deſign;

            <p>Monſieur <hi>Sorbiere,</hi> who feigned himſelf to
be one of that Number, expected him there
ſupply'd with ſuch Arms as he had required of
M. <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> to aſſault him about his opinion
of <hi>a Vacuum.</hi> Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> was armed
with the patience to Anſwer all his Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
without complaining of the unſeaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the time, whereby he was ſtraiten'd.
M. <hi>Sorbiere</hi> having ſpent his whole ſtock of
Ammunition againſt him, could not for ſhame
beg any new Arguments touching a <hi>Vacuum</hi>
of M. <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> but ſought out other Subjects to
plague and quite weary Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi>
out of his Skin; applying himſelf rather to
find what to object, than to comprehend what

writes to M. <hi>Gaſſendus,</hi> to give him an account

<hi>Des Cartes</hi> to be ſerviceable to him; yea,
and he ſet them ſo very much at variance, that

               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:52044:101"/>
was Author of this Tranſlation; who deſired
Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> to review it, before he
gave leave to publiſh it. He did ſo, and

ſome of his Notions, and to make ſome. Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
in his <hi>Original.</hi> Inſomuch that theſe
Tranſlations have as great an advantage as that
of his Principles, which ſurpaſſes the Originals
in goodneſs. Now M. <hi>Curcellaeus</hi> tranſlated
nothing but his Diſcourſe <hi>de Methodo,</hi> and the
Treatiſe of Dioptriques and Meteors. He
did not meddle with Geometry; whether he
judged it above his reach, or whether he had
notice that M. <hi>Schooten</hi> had undertaken to
tranſlate it, we know not.</p>

a great many of his Friends and Acquaintance,

all laid their heads together, how to ſettle and

to his Eldeſt Brother's Houſe, and then to <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagnes</hi>

upon no other Errand than he did in <hi>Britagne,</hi>
to viſit his Friends and Relations; and ſo
came back to <hi>Paris</hi> towards the middle of

of his Principles, and the
Latine Tranſlation of his Eſſays finiſhed, and

of <hi>Principles</hi> did not come out, neither did
that Piece he called his <hi>World,</hi> nor his <hi>Courſe
of Philoſophy,</hi> both of which were ſuppreſs'd.
He had a mind to divide them into other
Parts: The Firſt of which contains the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of Humane Knowledge, which one may
call the firſt Philoſophy or Metaphyſicks:
wherein it hath very much relation and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion
with his Meditations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:52044:102"/>
The Second contains what is moſt general
in Philoſophy, and the Explanation of the firſt
Laws of Nature, and of the principles of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
things, the Proprieties of Bodies, Space,
and Motion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Third contains a particular Explanation,
of the Syſtem of the World, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
of what we mean by the Heavens and
Celeſtial Bodies.</p>
            <p>The Fourth contains whatſoever belongs to
the Earth.</p>
            <p>That which is moſt remarkable in this
Work, is, That the Author after having firſt
of all eſtabliſhed the diſtinction and difference
he puts between the Soul and the Body, when
he hath laid down, for the Principles of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal
things, bigneſs, figure and local motion;
all which are things in themſelves ſo clear and
intelligible, that they are granted and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by every one whatſoever; he hath found
out a way to explain all Nature in a manner,
and to give a reaſon of the moſt wonderful
Effects, without altering the Principles; yea,
and without being inconſiſtent with himſelf in
any thing whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Yet had he not the preſumption for all that
to believe he had hit upon the explication of
all natural things, eſpecially ſuch that do not
fall under our ſenſes, in the ſame manner as
they really and truly are in themſelves. He
ſhould do ſomething indeed, if he could but

               </gap>he Phenomena's of Nature, this he judged
ſufficient for the uſe of Life, the profit and
benefit of which ſeems to be the main and
only end one ought to propoſe to himſelf in
Mechanicks, Phyſick, or Medicine; and in
all Arts that may be brought to perfection
by the help of Phyſick or natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy.</p>
            <p>But of all things he hath explained, there is
not one of them that doth not ſeem at leaſt
morally certain in reſpect of the profit of life,
notwithſtanding they may be uncertain in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of the abſolute Power of God. Nay,
there are ſeveral of them that are abſolutely, or
more than morally certain; ſuch as are Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
Demonſtrations, and thoſe evident
ratiocinations he hath framed concerning the
exiſtence of material things. Nevertheleſs,
he was indued with that Modeſty, as no
where to aſſume the authority of poſitively
deciding, or ever to aſſert any thing for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable.</p>
            <p>Altho' what he intended to offer, under the
Name of <hi>Principles</hi> of Philoſophy, was brought
to that Concluſion, that one could not lawfully
nor reaſonably require more for the perfecting
his deſign; yet did it give ſome cauſe to his
Friends, to hope to ſee the Explication of all
other things, which made people ſay, That his
Phyſick was not compleat. He promiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
likewiſe to explain after the ſame manner,
the nature of other more particular Bodies,
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:52044:103"/>
that belong to the Terreſtrial Globe; as, Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
Plants, Animals, and <hi>Man</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar;
After which, he propoſed to himſelf
(according as God ſhould pleaſe to lengthen
out his days) to treat with the ſame exactneſs
of all Phyſick or Medicine, of Mechanicks, and
of the whole Doctrine of Morality or Ethicks;
whereby to preſent the World with an entire
Body of Philoſophy.</p>
            <p>He dedicated his Book of Principles to his

would not ſuffer her to dwell long upon theſe
Arts, by which the greateſt Wits of her Sex,
who are ſatisfied with deſiring to ſeem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body,
are commonly limited. She deſir'd to
proceed to thoſe parts of Learning, that the
ſtrongeſt Application of Men had advanced, and
accompliſh'd her ſelf with, and became a great
proficient in Philoſophy and Mathematicks;
till ſuch time as ſeeing the Eſſays of Monſieur
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> his Philoſophy, ſhe conceived ſuch
high eſteem and affection for his Doctrine, that
ſhe look'd upon all ſhe had learn'd till that time
as good as nothing; and ſo put her ſelf under

his Principles.</p>

at the Fountain Head; and the great
deſire to do her Service nearer, was one of
the reaſons that drew him to <hi>Leiden</hi> &amp; to <hi>Ein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>degeest.</hi>
Never did Maſter more happily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
the docibility, aptneſs, penetration, and
withal the ſolidity of a Scholar's Mind. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
accuſtomed her inſenſibly to the profound
Meditation of the grand Myſteries of Nature,
and ſufficiently exerciſing of her in the moſt
abſtracted Queſtions of Geometry, and the
moſt ſublime ones of Metaphyſicks. There
was no longer any thing abſtruſe or myſterious
to her; and he ingeniouſly confeſſeth and own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,
that he had not yet met with any beſides
her (he excepted <hi>Regius</hi> in another place) that
ever arrived at a perfect underſtanding of the
Works he had publiſhed till that time. By
this Teſtimony that he bore to the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Capacity of the Princeſs, he intended to
diſtinguiſh her from thoſe who were not able
to apprehend his Metaphyſicks, altho' they
might have ſome inſight into Geometry; and

pure effect of the Evidence that his Cauſe was
good. The Judges of <hi>Groninguen</hi> ſending him
a Copy of the Judgment, together with all the
Acts that ſerved to the proſecuting the Cauſe,
he judged it convenient to diſpatch them to
the Magiſtrates of <hi>

of <hi>Voetius</hi> their Miniſter, written to Father

his Ingratitude, who had been Scholar and
Confident to <hi>Voetius.</hi> They termed the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
that lay upon him to prefer Truth to
Falſhood, before the Tribunal of his Judges,
ingratitude. But becauſe he was no longer
under the laſh; they entered an Action of
Scandal againſt him, as tho' he had done
wrong. Nevertheleſs, the threatnings <hi>Schooc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kius</hi>
thunder'd out againſt <hi>Voetius,</hi> that he
would diſcover all his Roguery in Court,
cauſed the latter to ſurceaſe his Proceſs juſt
when it was upon the point of being try'd at
<hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>trecht,</hi> and they never really pardoned one
another after.</p>
            <p>The diſpoſition of Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> in
reſpect of them was quite otherwiſe. The
Storm once blown over; he ſcrupled not to
diſcover his heart: and had the generoſity to
facilitate their reconciliation, and freely ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
them his friendſhip; but <hi>Voetius</hi> ſeem'd
not to be ſenſible of all theſe Courteſies.</p>
            <p>He boaſted that he had reſerved another
Action ſtill againſt him, that he could make
uſe of when occaſion ſerved. This put Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> upon drawing up an Apologe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Manifeſto for the Magiſtrates of <hi>Utrecht,</hi>
to the intent he might once for all bury all the
whole Affair in Oblivion. He made for them
an Hiſtorical and rational Compendium of
what paſt in their City from the Year 1639<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
touching his Philoſophy and Perſon: He laid
before them the juſtice of the Cauſe, and the

            </p>

            <p>The Experience he had of Monſ. <hi>Des Cartes</hi>

Philoſophy and Medicine.</p>
            <p>This laſt Letter cauſed <hi>Regius</hi> to pluck off
his Mask: and being reſolved to Sacrifice his
Maſter's Honour to his own; he quite and
clean renounced his Diſcipline by a Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
written 23d of <hi>July</hi> 1645. after ſuch an

tell us of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s ingratitude to <hi>Plato,</hi> and
of <hi>Maximus</hi> the Cynick's inſolence to <hi>Gregory
Nazianzen</hi> is not incredible; <hi>Regius</hi> went far

Schiſm that Glory which involved him in
ſuch Dangers and Perſecutions that had like to
have made him the <hi>Proto-martyr</hi> of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſian
Sect. Nay, and he joyn'd Injuſtice and
Unfaithfulneſs to his Revolt, for retaining the
beſt part of his Maſter's Doctrine, thereby
to get the ſame Honour as he did before, he
disfigured and ſpoil'd it, as he pleaſed. And
under pretence that Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſo long as he lived, to acknowledge it to
be his, becauſe of that forreign outſide: He
ſeized upon it after his Death; ſuppreſſing

and outrages of <hi>Regius;</hi> with ſo much wiſdom
and ſweetneſs, that might have been capable
to have made an Apology for him if he had
needed one; and he would not make an end
of keeping a Correſpondence with this ingrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> returned very much
ſatisfied the Tenth of the Month to <hi>Egmond,</hi>
where he paſs'd the Winter being very ſevere
that Year; then he compoſed two little Works
to paſs away the time; becauſe the Plants in
his Garden were not yet in a Condition to
ſupply with Experiments neceſſary for the
Continuation of his Phyſicks.</p>
            <p>The firſt of theſe Works was the Anſwer,<note place="margin">He an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers M. <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> his inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note>

into French, with ſofter Expreſſions in
behalf of the laſt, whom he deſired to bring
to an Agreement with our Philoſopher; the
other was a ſmall Treatiſe of the Nature of
the Paſſions of the Soul. His deſign was not
to make a thing that was in all Points ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
as to deſerve to ſee light, but only to
exerciſe himſelf upon Morality for his own
Edification, and to try if his Phyſicks or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
Philoſophy might be as ſerviceable to

and certain Foundations in Morality.</p>
            <p>VIII.<note place="margin">His diſpute with M. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berval</hi> about Vibrations.</note> In this <hi>interim,</hi> Monſ. <hi>Roberval</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
by little and little the reſolution he had
taken up to live in good intelligence with
Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> after the honour he had
received from one of his Viſits in <hi>Paris,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd
inſenſibly to his reſtleſs <hi>Genius.</hi> He
ſpoke, hit he, miſs he; of what he knew, and
what he knew not, with very little precaution.
Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> had notice of it by ſome
who peradventure repreſented Monſieur <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berval</hi>
more in the fault than he really was,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:52044:111"/>
without ever conſidering that there was more
of weakneſs than malice in his behaviour and
deportment.</p>
            <p>He had advice at the beginning of 1646. of
two main Points, concerning which, M. <hi>Rober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val</hi>
boaſted he could baffle, and run him down.
The firſt, was concerning the Queſtion of
<hi>Pappus;</hi> of which he propoſed no new diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
at that time. The other was about <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations;</hi>
that is as much as to ſay, what big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
every body of what figure ſoever, muſt
have, being ſuſpended in the Air by its extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
to make its turns and returns equal to
thoſe of a Plummet hanged at a thread of a
length given.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion of <hi>Vibrations</hi> was propounded
to him by Father <hi>Merſennus,</hi> which he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the 21ſt of <hi>February,</hi> and the 2d of
<hi>March;</hi> and after that by M. <hi>Cavendiſh</hi> then
at <hi>Paris.</hi> He ſent the Solution of this Queſtion
to that Noble Perſon the 30th of <hi>March:</hi>
whereupon Monſieur <hi>de Roberval</hi> made ſome
Obſervations, which M. <hi>Cavendiſh</hi> did not
fail to diſpatch to Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes.</hi> He
received an Anſwer to them ſome time after.
Now Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> ſeeing that M. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berval</hi>
relied chiefly upon his Experiments,
he ſends Father <hi>Merſennus</hi> word that he durſt
not preſume of himſelf to undertake at firſt
daſh, to give a ſufficient Reaſon, for all that
one might have experimented. But, that
he believed all the Cunning in examining
Experiments, conſiſted in chooſing ſuch that
depend leaſt upon divers Cauſes, and ſuch
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:52044:111"/>
whoſe true Reaſons might be the moſt eaſily
diſcovered.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> could have heartily
wiſht to ſee a timely end of this Diſpute, which
he perceived degenerate at laſt into unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
needleſs Queſtions: But M. <hi>Roberval</hi> was
pleaſed to prolong them beyond the Years
end. This Conduct of his, together with his
Fopperies about <hi>Pappus</hi> his Queſtion, brought
an old houſe upon his head, by the cenſure of
his <hi>Ariſtarchus;</hi> that is to ſay, (a Book of his
touching the Syſtem of the World) together
with a Judgment upon the Intellect and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity
of this Geometrician, which Monſieur
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> ſent to Father <hi>Merſennus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Much what about the ſame time that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
<hi>Seneca</hi>'s Book,<note place="margin">A Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of Moral Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy with the Princeſs <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth.</hi>

               <hi>De vitâ Beatâ,</hi> of an
Happy Life, in favour to the Princeſs <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth</hi>
his Scholar, who had deſired him to
furniſh her wherewithal to divert her, being
out of favour at the <hi>Spa;</hi> where her Phyſitians
had debarred her of all Study, and ſerious
application of Mind: the judicious reflection
the Princeſs made upon the ſaid Work, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
him afterwards to handle divers of the
moſt important Queſtions of Morality with
her, touching <hi>Summum bonum,</hi> or Soveraign
Good, the Liberty of Man, the State of the
Soul, the uſe of Reaſon, the uſe of the Paſſions,
of virtuous and vicious Actions, and touching
the good and bad things of Life.</p>
            <p>Nothing at that time interrupted the Joy he
received from that happy Communication of
Moral Philoſophy with this Princeſs,<note place="margin">He diſowns <hi>Regius</hi> and his Book.</note> except

               <hi>The Civility and Courteſie of the Author
in acknowledging how much he was behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> upon the receipt of

Author had ſome thoughts to Compoſe a

moved him to the reſolution of contradicting

he found that they had made one of his

had come to <hi>Paris</hi> upon no other Errand but
to buy a Scroll of Parchment; ay, and the
deareſt and moſt inſignificant one, that ever
came to his hands. That which he moſt took
pet at, was, that none of thoſe who were the
occaſion of his coming up to Court, did declare
that they had any other buſineſs with him, but
only to ſtare him in the face, as if he had been
ſome Elephant or Leopard.</p>
            <p>This ſo unexpected adventure, taught him
never more to undertake a ſleeveleſs Errand

only he long'd to underſtand beforehand, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the envious perſons, that his Philoſophy
had procured him, had not been too quick for
him at the Court of <hi>Sweden,</hi> to endeavour,
to render him ſome ill office or other, in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſing
the Queen's mind. He was not
ignorant of the averſion the Swediſh Nobility,
and the beſt part of the Officers of that Court,
teſtified for all ſort of Science. He knew
likewiſe that the Queens paſſion for Learned
Men, began to become the object of ſcorn,
railery and obloquy of Strangers; it was in
every bodies mouth that ſhe aſſembled all
the <hi>Pedants</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> to <hi>Stockholm,</hi> and that it
would not be long ere the government of the
Realm would be managed by Grammarians. He
was afraid to ſee himſelf counted as ones hail
fellow well met with this ſort of Cattel, where
the Natives of the Country, do not care to
diſtinguiſh Strangers. And then the buſineſs
of the Catholick Religion, helpt to increaſe
his Scruples. Now it was <hi>Freinſheinius</hi> his
buſineſs, to whom he communicated ſecretly
his Thoughts, to diſſipate them, and once
more to be very earneſt with him in behalf of
the Queen.</p>
            <p>Altho' he began to appoint his return pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely

            <p>He happily arrived at <hi>Stockholm</hi> at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning

<hi>Chanut's,</hi> Siſter to his Friend Monſieur <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelier,</hi>
where he preſented to her ſome Letters
from the Ambaſſador her Husband who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
him, and had provided him an apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

as was obſerved by the whole Court,
which perhaps did not a little contribute, to
augment the jealouſie of ſome of the Learned,
to whom, his coming ſeem'd formidable.
At the ſecond viſit he paid the Queen, ſhe
diſcloſed to him the deſign ſhe had of getting
him into <hi>Sweden</hi> for good and all, by a good
ſettlement. But having prepar'd himſelf from
the time he left <hi>Holland,</hi> againſt all ſort of

            <p>Afterward ſhe contrived with him ſome
means whereby to learn his Philoſophy by
word of Mouth: and judging aright that ſhe
ſhould have occaſion for all her Wits about
her, and all her application to accompliſh her
deſign ſuccesfully, ſhe pitcht upon the firſt
hour after her <hi>levé</hi> for this Study, as being the
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:52044:125"/>
moſt quiet and leiſure time of all the day,
when ſhe perceived her Mind more ſedate,
and her head more diſengaged from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance
of affairs. Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
with abundance of profound reſpect
the Commiſſion ſhe granted him, to meet in
the Cloſet of her Library every morning by
five of the Clock, without ever alledging the
irregularity ſhe muſt needs cauſe in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of living, nor the danger to which ſhe
ſhould probably expoſe his health, in this new
change of abode, yea and in a ſeaſon too, that
was much more ſevere in <hi>Sweden,</hi> than in any
other place, he had ever lived in before.</p>
            <p>The Queen in recompence, granted him the
favour that he deſired <hi>Freinſheinius</hi> to beg of
her, which conſiſted, in diſpenſing with him
as to the nice Ceremonies of the Court, and
to free him from all confinement, or to ſpeak
in the Language of Philoſophers, from all the
miſeries of Courtiers. Yet, before they begun
their Morning Exerciſes, it was her will and
pleaſure that he ſhould allow himſelf a month
or ſix weeks to compoſe himſelf, to familiarize
himſelf with the <hi>genius</hi> of the Country, to
make his new acquaintance take deeper root,
by which ſhe was in hopes to make him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in his new abode, and retain him by her
the remainder of his Life. But having fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thomed
the capacity of his Spirit, that extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it ſelf to other things beſides Philoſophy,
ſhe did not demur long, before ſhe appointed
him to be one of her Privy Counſel: and the
confidence ſhe repoſed in him, prevail'd on
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:52044:125"/>
her to regulate her own particular conduct and
behaviour, and even divers points concerning
the government of her State, according to his
advices. He made good uſe of this new favour,
not only to be ſerviceable to Count <hi>Bregy,</hi> and
other worthy perſons near her, but above all,
to obliterate out of her mind, the reaſons of
ſtrangeneſs, averſion, and coldneſs ſhe ſeemed

between Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> and thoſe
that vainly profeſt to be knowing, who
brought an Odium upon Sciences, to all the

the Edition of his Treatiſe of the Paſſions of

it to her, by reaſon that it was chiefly
compoſed for his moſt illuſtrious Schollar the
Princeſs <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> whom he would be ſure
not to forget. To the intent he might make
this work intelligible to all manner of perſons,
he inlarged it by three parts upon Monſieur
<hi>Clerſelier</hi>'s Advice. He divided it into three
parts, in the firſt of which, is treated of the
Paſſion in general, and by the way upon the
nature of the Soul, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the ſecond, of the
ſix primitive Paſſions; and in the third, of all
the reſt.</p>
            <p>The ſight of this Piece, made the Queen
ſuppoſe there might be amongſt Monſieur <hi>Des
Cartes</hi> his Papers, many more Treatiſes that
had not yet come to light. And having a
ſtrong deſire to make him compile a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat
body of all his Philoſophy, which ſhe
liked more and more, ſhe was pleas'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage

            <p>Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> in obedience to the
Queens command,<note place="margin">His Poſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous works.</note> began to rummiſh, and
ranſack his Trunk, where his Papers were,
which he had bound up, hand over head, at

compleat in them. They were all in pieces
ſcattered up and down; of which they have
compiled Treatiſes ſince, that have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.
Amongſt the moſt conſiderable of his
fragments were,</p>
            <p>That <hi>De Homine,</hi> which Monſieur <hi>Clerſelier</hi>
had cauſed to be Printed ſince, wherein the

put it out pretty well corrected.</p>
            <p>That <hi>De l'Explication de Engins,</hi> which was
miſſing, went aſtray after his death, and
which indeed, is nothing elſe in a manner,

            <p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:52044:127"/>
But the moſt conſiderable of all his Poſthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous

               </note> the Q. of <hi>Sweden</hi> ſeeing the

communicated to him the deſign ſhe had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain'd

Pretences, ſhe would hearken to none, but
that of the coldneſs of the Climat; becauſe
ſhe believed that in effect his Temperament
muſt needs ſuffer much in ſuch a cold Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
The Expedient ſhe propoſed to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador
was, to chuſe him a noble and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Charge in the moſt Southern Parts of
the Crown of <hi>Sweden,</hi> acquired by the Peace
of <hi>Munſter,</hi> either in the Archbiſhoprick of

            <p>The Indiſpoſition of the Ambaſſador whom
the Queen had charged to put the buſineſs in
execution, conjoyntly with a Senator of the
Kingdom, put a ſtop to it; which proved very
hurtful, not to Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes,</hi> for whom
God had deſigned ſomething elſe; but to his
Heirs, who failed of being Lords in <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Ambaſſador fell Sick on the 18th of
<hi>January,</hi> at his return from a walk with
Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes;</hi> and what diligence ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he uſed to ſolicit his Friend, Night and
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:52044:128"/>
Day, yet for all that, he fail'd not to be at the

with the Queen, without complaining
of the ſeverity of the Seaſon, which was more
than ordinary that year, and which daily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired
his health.</p>
            <p>The Queen who dream't of nothing leſs
than to incommode him,<note place="margin">The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of an Acadamy.</note> obliged him at the

to return after Dinner to the Palace, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
with her concerning a Conference or Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly
of Learned Men, that ſhe had thoughts
of founding in form of an Academy, of which
ſhe was to be Chief and Protectrice. She
would have him to draw up the Model or

it her accordingly the Firſt of <hi>February,</hi> which
was the laſt time he had the honour to ſee her
Majeſty. The Queen mightily approved eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Article, but was ſomewhat ſurprized at

She queſtioned whether it might not be a

he perceived himſelf,<note place="margin">His Death.</note> ſeized with an Illneſs
that was to put an end to his days, and the
Ambaſſador began to recover. The next day
being <hi>Candlemaſs-Day,</hi> our Philoſopher with
other Catholicks, approached the Sacraments
of Pennance and Euchariſt, which he received
from the hands of Father <hi>Viogué,</hi> an Auguſtin
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:52044:129"/>
Friar, Miſſionary and Almoner to the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador;
he was able to finiſh the Ceremonies
of the reſt of the Day, ſtanding up.</p>
            <p>The Symptomes of his Malady, were the
very ſame that preceded the Ambaſſador's,
and were followed by a continued Feaver, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with an Inflammation of his Lungs,
juſt as the Ambaſſador was taken. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
of this regular was of living, added to
the dividing of his Care between the Queen
and the Sick Ambaſſador, in a Seaſon that
was an Enemy to his Conſtitution, and more
rigid than it had been for Threeſcore Years,
by the report of ancient People, cauſed his
Feaver to be more Malignant than the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador's
was. It was within him the firſt

took great care to ſend a Gentleman twice a
day to ſee how he did.</p>
            <p>His Brain began to be diſcharged at the end
of the 7th day, which made him a little more
the Maſter of his Head, and faculties of his
Reaſon; that was the firſt time he was ſenſible
of his Feaver: He took notice of the Error
he had hitherto laboured under, and now
thought of nothing but to dye like a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Philoſopher. He got himſelf let Blood
twice together, and in a great quantity, but
to no purpoſe, it was then too late. He pray'd
them to ſend for Father <hi>Viogué</hi> his Confeſſor,
who was about the exerciſe of his Miſſion
ſome Leagues diſtant from <hi>Stockholm:</hi> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
thoſe who were about him, not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe

Mercy of God, and of the Courage where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
he was to ſuffer the Separation of his
Soul. He remain'd quiet and ſtill the two laſt
days; and Departed peaceably in the Arms of
the Ambaſſador and Father <hi>Viogué,</hi> the 11th of

Aged 53 Years, 10 Months, and 11 Days.</p>

            <p>The Ambaſſador that had not yet been able
to ſtir out of Doors ſince he fell Sick, went
in the Afternoon to pay a Viſit to the Queen:

Catholicks and Children that died before they

            <p>The Ambaſſador, whom the Queen had
given to underſtand that ſhe perſiſted in her
reſolution to rear him a Marble Monument,
judged that before-hand, it would be much
better to erect a plain Tomb over the Grave

Oblong Square of Free-ſtone cemented, the

very delicate, and well-proportioned in all the
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:52044:132"/>
ſhape and ſymettry of Parts; yet he ſeem'd to
have an Head a little too big in proportion to
the Trunk of his Body. His Brow or Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head
was broad, and ſtanding out a little; His
Complexion pale from his Infancy to his lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Colledge, and then mixt with a pretty
ruddy vermillion bluſh till his retirement into
<hi>Holland,</hi> and ever ſince ſomewhat ſallow till
his dying day; He had upon his Cheek a kind
of Pimple or Puſh that broke now and then,
and grew again; His Under-Lip ſtuck out a
little, a pretty wide Mouth; a Noſe of a big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
anſwerable to its length; His Eyes dark
grey; His Sight pleaſant and firm to the end
of his days; His Countenance evermore ſerene
and calm; His Mind affable and Courteous;
The Tone of his Voice pleaſant between
Baſe and Treble; yet too feeble to carry on
any long Diſcourſe, occaſioned by an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Lungs he brought into the World
with him.</p>
            <p>His Hair and Eye-brows pretty black, the
Hair of his Chin not quite ſo black; and he
began to be grey at the age of 43 years. Some
few years after he wore a Perriwig, but of a
faſhion that reſembled his own Hair; and that
too upon the account of his Health.</p>
            <p>He followed leſs the Mode, then he ſuffer'd
himſelf to be drawn into it; he ſtaid till it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
common that he might not affect Singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity.
He was never diſregarded, yet he
chiefly avoided to appear in the Garb of a Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher.
At ſuch time as he ſequeſtered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
from much Company in <hi>Holland,</hi> he chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Sword for a Cloak.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:52044:132"/>
His courſe of Diet was always uniform.<note place="margin">His Diet.</note>
Sobriety was natural to him. He drunk little
Wine, and was ſometimes a whole Month toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
without drinking a drop yet ſeeming very
jocund and pleaſant at Table, his frugality not
burthenſom to his Company.</p>
            <p>He was neither nice nor difficult in the
choice of his Victuals, and he had accuſtomed
his Palat to every thing that was not prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
to the health of the Body. His Diet did
not conſiſt in eating ſeldom, but to diſcern
the quality of the Victual. His judgment was,
that it was good always to keep the Stomach
and other <hi>Viſcera</hi> a doing, as we do to Horſes,
but that it ought to be with ſuch things as
afford ſmall nouriſhment, as Roots and Fruits,
which he believed more proper to prolong
the Life of Man, than the Fleſh of Animals.</p>
            <p>He obſerved that he eat more greedily and
ſlept ſounder when he was ſad and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
or in ſome eminent danger, than he did
at any other time.</p>
            <p>He ſlept much, or at leaſt his awaking was
never forced; ſo ſoon as ever he perceived
himſelf diſ-ingaged from ſleep, he ſtudied,
meditating in Bed, and rai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed but half his
Body now and then, to commit his thoughts
to writing. This is the reaſon why he often
continued ten Hours, nay, ſometimes twelve,
in his Bed. His Condeſcenſion to the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of his Body, never proceeded to an Apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
or ſo far as inſenſibility of them. He
knew Nature muſt be ſupply'd. He laboured
hard and long. He delighted pretty much in
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:52044:133"/>
bodily exerciſe, and indulged himſelf therein
at his time for recreation; till at length, his
ſedentary life broke him off that Cuſtom.</p>
            <p>He was apt to believe that health of Body,
was the greateſt Bleſſing in this life next to
Virtue. He had no great ſhare of it in his
Infancy, and it was but ill preſerved whilſt he
was ſubject to the government of Phyſicians;
he was troubled during his Childhood with a
dry Cough, hereditary to him from his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and very infirm till the Age of 13. when
he was let Blood the firſt; but never after till
the Eve of his Death. He reckoned Phlebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>botomy,
extream dangerous to moſt People.
At the age of 19 or 20 years, he thought he
was not ſo much a Fool as not to be his own
Phyſician. Therefore he thought he was of
age to take upon him the Adminiſtration of
his health, and diſpenſed with a Phyſician 'till
his mortal Diſtemper. He abhorr'd not only
Mountebanks, but even the Drugs of Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries
&amp; Empericks; yea, and he required great
Caution in the adminiſtring Chymical Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
When he was diſengaged and free from
that heat of Liver, that made him in love with
a Military Life in his youthful days, he took
up a courſe of Life ſo even and uniform, that
he was never Sick with any thing, except by
that Foreign Cauſe, that brought him to his
long home. The two grand Remedies were
his ſpare regular Diet, and moderation in his
Exerciſe: yet he preferr'd before them, <hi>thoſe</hi>
of the Mind and Spirit, that have a mighty
influence upon the Body; as plainly appear'd
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:52044:133"/>
by the great change; Anger, Wrath, Fear,
and other Paſſions did excite in him.</p>
            <p>The manner of living he preſcribed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
was founded upon the oeconomy and well-ordering
his Family. He entertain'd a ſufficient
number of Domeſticks, all pickt and cull'd,
and very neat; and he took care to get them
all bandſom, both as to Body and Mind:
His Houſe was like a School of Learning and
Vertue to them; and not content to render
them knowing and honeſt, he thought it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
his Duty to meliorate and advance their
Fortunes: and that was the Reaſon why there
was always a great deal of earneſt ſtriving,
and ſuing who ſhould firſt get into his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
and men always look'd upon a Place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
his Servants as a very advantagious
Poſt. On his part, he treated them with that
Indulgence and Mildneſs, that he won them
over, and brought them to his beck by meer
love and kindneſs. As for thoſe of an higher
rank, who neareſt approached him in quality
of Secretaries, or <hi>Valets de Chambre;</hi> he counted
them ſo little Inferior to him, that one would
have taken them for his Equals ſometimes.
This thing conduced much to mould and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del
their Heart and Mind; nay, moſt of them
became Perſons of great Worth and Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
in the World. Men have obſerved it
in the Perſon of M. <hi>de ville Breſſieux,</hi> a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
at <hi>Grenoble,</hi> of M. <hi>Gutſchowen,</hi> Regius<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Profeſſor
at <hi>Louvain,</hi> of the Sieur <hi>Gillot</hi> the
Mathematician, and Sieur <hi>Schluter,</hi> Auditor, or
Intendant of Juſtice in <hi>Sweden,</hi> and of a great
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:52044:134"/>
many more Perſons preferr'd to great Places,
who are at this day very eminent in <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>II. The Expences of his Houſe was ever well
regulated,<note place="margin">His uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the Goods of Fortune.</note> tho' his Paſſion was wonderful for
multiplying Experiments; yet he never affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
running in Debt beyond his yearly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue.
This Revenue was about 6000 Livres
and upward <hi>per annum;</hi> if you except ſome
few years at the latter end of his life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
he had augmented it. If ſo be it had been
not ſo plentiful at the beginning, it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
have ſeem'd ſufficient for him.
Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> did conſider the good
things of the World, not as a covetous, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Gentleman; but as a rich and contented
Philoſopher. He carried it always very high to
Fortune, and amongſt the Croud of thoſe that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore
this blind Goddeſs, his ſport was bravely
to ſcorn and laugh at her, contenting himſelf to
deplore the Condition of ſome Philoſophers
his Friends, who ſhewed ſo much weakneſs as
to complain of her. So Fortune again had a
mind to be even with him ſeeming to be very
ſenſible of his Diſdain, ſhe endeavoured to be
revenged of him upon every occaſion that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
it ſelf of being Rich. Yet was he not
one of thoſe whimſical Fops, and churliſh Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicks
that ſeek all occaſions to dare her, or
inſult over her; no, he was never guilty of
the Vanity to triumph over her with oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
And indeed, one of the Principal Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims
he preſcribed himſelf for the guidance of
his Life and Converſation, was <hi>to endeavour
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:52044:134"/>
rather to conquer himſelf, than Fortune; to change
his deſires rather than the order of the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He was endowed with no leſs generoſity,
than unconcernedneſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his heart would give
place to no man alive but to his King in point
of Liberality. He was never the man that
would accept from any private perſon whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
the relief that was offer'd him, to ſupply
the expences that his Experiments required.
He civilly refuſed a pretty conſiderable Sum
of Money which the Count <hi>d'Avaux</hi> ſent him
into <hi>Holland.</hi> He excuſed himſelf in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
to Monſieur <hi>de Montmor,</hi> who with many
inſtant entreaties, offered him to make his beſt
of one of his Country Houſes and Farm of
4000 Livres <hi>per annum.</hi> Other Perſons of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Quality, laid open their Treaſures to him,
but all to no purpoſe. He counted it a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
and uncivil part in him to borrow ought
of any perſon, that he was not able to reſtore
with intereſt: and he pretended it would have
been burthenſome to him to perceive himſelf
indebted to the Publick. But altho' he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
the unconcernedneſs of Philoſophers for
Riches, yet was he not pufft up with their
Pride. He did not only look upon thoſe that
make good uſe of Riches with a favourable
Eye, but he thought it his Duty not to neglect
and ſlight that Eſtate his Father had the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to reſerve for him. He accounted a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Patrimony as a <hi>Preſent</hi> of Nature, and not
of Fortune: and of all the Goods that one is
capable of acquiring in this World, there is
none more innocent, or more according to
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:52044:135"/>
that order God hath appointed. This made
him one day tell his elder Brother in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
That <hi>he more valued 1000 Livres by Inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance
than 10000 Livres that came to him
otherwiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>III. How you muſt not aſcribe Monſieur
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> his being rich and contented,<note place="margin">His retired Life.</note> to his
modeſt Revenue, that ſeem'd competent; nor
yet to his Frugality: It was his choice of a
ſolitary Sequeſter'd Life that rendred him ſo.
He admitted of very few Viſits at any time,
and return'd yet leſs; yet was he neither a <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanthropus,</hi>
nor moroſely Melancholy: He car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
along with him to the very receſſes of
his Solitude, that pleaſant humour and natural
briskneſs, that was obſerved in him from his
tender years; His uſual chearfulneſs made him
do things without ſtraining; and if we credit
him, facilitated their ſucceſs; yea, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
not a little to his health; for without
it, he could not have ſuſtain'd the weight of
his retirement with ſo much perſeverance:
that was it, that changed his inclination for
retirement, into a real doting upon a confined
Secret Life. And his deſire never to relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh
it, induc'd him to take two <hi>Symbolum's</hi> or
Motto's very proper to hinder him from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting
this reſolution; the firſt out of <hi>Ovid:</hi>
               <q>Benè qui latuit, benè vixit.</q>
The remembrance of which made him often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time
quite off the deſign of publiſhing his
Works. The other is taken out of <hi>Seneca</hi>'s
Tragedies,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:52044:135"/>
               <q>
                  <l>Illi mors gravis incubat</l>
                  <l>Qui unus nimis omnibus</l>
                  <l>Ignotus moritur ſibi.</l>
               </q>
Which is a ſmart Condemning of ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
who love to be known by others, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
knowing themſelves.</p>
            <p>After he had reduc't himſelf to a private
condition,<note place="margin">His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of Renown.</note> he ever judged that the inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience,
of being too well known was a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
diſtraction, and taking a man off his
deſign, never to go abroad out of himſelf.
But only when he had a mind ſecretly and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
to converſe with Nature, and never to
quit and forſake Nature, but to come home
again to himſelf. He lookt upon the deſire
men are taken with, to live in the good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
and minds of men as a frivolous vanity:
yea, and never did Philoſopher make leſs ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
of that glory and ſplendour, moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
find in what they call reputation: he had
not ſuch over-weaning thoughts of himſelf, as
to take it ill, that, if any one thought of him,
he had not a good opinion of him: but he
could rather have choſen that he ſhould never
think of him at all.</p>
            <p>The trade of a ſolitary life,<note place="margin">His habits of writing, of reading. His ſtile.</note> coſt him but a
few months Apprentiſhip to learn, becauſe the
inclination he had to it, was ſeconded by his
temper and conſtitution, and a particular hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of his. The habit of meditation that
he had got ever ſince he left the Colledge,
made him mighty reſerved and ſparing of his
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:52044:136"/>
Tongue. But altho' he ſpoke but very little
at any time, yet he ſpoke always to purpoſe
and very naturally. His converſing was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſtarcht or affected, never troubleſome or
uneaſie. He ſhunned above all things to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
Learned or a Philoſopher in Diſcourſes.
He was as little inclined to commit his Specu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
to writing, as to vent them by word
of mouth. He was pretty much indiſpoſed
to write, but his ſmall, cloſe, ſtraight, regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
way of writing is ſufficient evidence, that
he had conquered this idleneſs by a long habit,
yet for all that he relaps't into it from time to
time, as appears not only from the great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnance
he teſtified in compoſing his Works,
but alſo from his uſual negligence to anſwer
his friends.</p>
            <p>He had not doubtleſs, ſo much liſtleſsneſs
and averſion for reading, as he ſhewed for
writing. We muſt nevertheleſs grant you,
that he did not read much, and that he had a
ſmall parcel of Books. Diſcouraged at the
unprofitableneſs and errours he obſerved in
Bookes, he ſolemnly forſook reading of them:
but that I may not tell an untruth, he did not
quite and clean forſake them, nay, he makes
his forſaking even ſuſpected of diſſimulation.
Some believe he made more uſe of Books than
he was willing every body ſhould know; and
they have been apt to ground this opinion up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the quality of the ſtile, and the multiplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of matter he treated of in his Works, but
more particularly in his Letters.</p>
            <p>This is a judgement, or rather a conjecture
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:52044:136"/>
fetched from the elegance of his ſtile; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
of phancy, and quaintneſs and exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his expreſſions.</p>
            <p>IV.<note place="margin">His Wit, Memory, and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> He had a mind of an almoſt infinite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
and of a ſtrength in a manner equal to the
extent; his penetration was prodigious in depth
and vivacity. This appear'd more eſpecially
when the buſineſs in debate was, to fathom
the depth of mans Soul, and preciſely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
what is poſſible for a man to do, and
what is above his reach or power.</p>
            <p>Never did man under the cope of Heaven,
manifeſt that which we call, a <hi>Geometrical
Spirit;</hi> and an exactneſs of Wit and Solidity
of Judgment in an higher degree. He ſhewed
it I ſay, in his not confounding the principles
one<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with another, in penetrating all the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
that may poſſibly be deduc'd from
them, and indeed never arguing falſely upon
known principles.</p>
            <p>His <hi>Memory</hi> was neither treacherous, nor
unhappy; but we don't ſee that it was anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
to the greatneſs of his parts. If he was
deficient in any thing upon that ſcore, it was
abundantly recompenced by that other portion
of the Soul, which we call <hi>Judgment,</hi> which
is the light of the humane Soul. He was ſolid
and judicious in all reſpects. He had a ſhrewd
inſight into things, very exquiſite, and a moſt
ſubtil diſcerning of that which is in common
uſe, which your greateſt Wits, eſpecially Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricians
are wont to paſs by and overlook.</p>
            <p>Nothing ever contributed more to bring
this excellent quality to perfection in him,<note place="margin">His love for Truth.</note>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:52044:137"/>
than his violent paſſion for <hi>Truth,</hi> that never
forſook him all his life long. The upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his heart, being always attended by the
rightneſs of ſenſe and underſtanding, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
care was to find out Truth in all his
Studies; and to make her appear nothing but
the truth and the naked truth, in all his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
in all his diſcourſes, openneſs and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
were at all times the particular character
that made him be differenced from thoſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
men, who ſeem'd to reſemble him in
other reſpects: and all that polite breeding he might
receive from his Education, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting
the Courts of great Perſons, was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
capable to make him double-minded or
falſe-hearted; nor to perſwade him, that fawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
counterfeiting, and lying ought to be
practiſed. Faults that are committed againſt
Truth, when they proceed from ignorance or
miſtake, where there is no deſign at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
to injure truth, appear'd to him pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
but if he had been upon the Bench as
a Judge, he would have proved inexorable as
to thoſe that are committed againſt Knowledge
and Love of Truth. Notwithſtanding, this
kindneſs he bore to Truth, puſht him on to
purſue her whereſoever he ſuſpected ſhe might
lye hid, yet he concluded that for finding of
her, he was to pitch principally upon the
Sciences, in which he did uſually examine
what they contained, and what ſolidity was
in them, to the end he might not loſe his
time, for that which ſignified nothing; and
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:52044:137"/>
that obſerve to others, what uſe and benefit
they were likely to make of them.</p>
            <p>V.<note place="margin">His aptneſs to learn.</note> A great many have believed that he was
not ignorant in any Science, and that he had
skill in all the Liberal Arts. But it may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
us to believe that he might have a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
knowledge in the Nature of all the Scien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
without being vers't in every particular
kind of them.</p>
            <p>He ſhewed more <hi>docibility</hi> and aptneſs, if
a man may ſo ſay, than real Science: this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
in him was a jewel ſo much the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable,
as it is very <hi>rare</hi> in the ring-leaders
of a Sect. The Paſſion he teſtified to correct
his faults, was always attended with a grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
acknowledgment to thoſe who let him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand
them.</p>
            <p>The Pride and Vanity his Adverſaries have
taxed him withal,<note place="margin">His mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty.</note> upon ſome occaſions, are
frivolous and ſuperficial, becauſe they never
took place, in his heart. But in reſpect of
ſuſpicions of haughtineſs and preſumption, that
they have imputed to him, they could not hold
out long againſt the brightneſs of his <hi>Modeſty,</hi>
that diſſipated them in a moment. This Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty
accompanied with abundance of polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
as the Noble Cantibrigian Philoſopher,
or <hi>More</hi> hath it, reſided much more in his
ſentiments than in his diſcourſes. It was no
where affected, but appear'd, as it were, in
its proper natural places, if you conſider the
little account he made of himſelf, and his
productions, and the averſion he ſhew'd for
praiſe and commendation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="270" facs="tcp:52044:138"/>

and civility, than of modeſty; this ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of diſpoſition that was diſperſt through
all his actions, and deportment, never went
under another name amongſt his friends:
but the trial his adverſaries made of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
changed its name to <hi>Moderation</hi> in reſpect
to them;<note place="margin">His Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> it was not in its miridian againſt
the turbulent Spirits of <hi>Gaſſendus</hi> and <hi>Fermats</hi>
temper: there was need of a <hi>Roberval</hi> to make
it ſhine out. But eſpecially there wanted
ſome giddy hair-brain'd Miniſters, and wild
extravagant Philoſophers to make it triumph.</p>
            <p>The love he bore all his life long for peace
and tranquillity, cauſed him by times to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>value
calumny, and forget injuries. He was
naturally an enemy to diſpute, eſpecially for
<hi>that</hi> which is mixt with wrangling, conteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and troubleſome heats; and thence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
his averſion to rip up the faults of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
or to make them greater than they were,
when he obſerved them in reading, this trade
ſeem'd unworthy of a man that owed all his
time to the inquiry after truth: nay he thought
he went out of his road, when he ſtopt to look
upon other mens wanderings.</p>
            <p>VI. So many lovely qualities could not chuſe
but get him the love of every body,<note place="margin">His friends.</note> ſo that
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:52044:138"/>
he did not want for friends, than whom no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
could boaſt to have more, but tho he did not
refuſe any mans friendſhip, yet he uſed a great
deal of diſcretion in affording <hi>his,</hi> becauſe he
endeavoured as much as poſſibly he could, not
to ſeparate it from his eſteem and reſpect.
He never placed confidence in any one, in
whom he had not obſerved Wiſdom; perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and conſummated with Science and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.</p>
            <p>He was a man of the moſt tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
in the World, even according to the
relation of thoſe who render'd themſelves the
moſt unworthy of his friendſhip. He ſhewed
a mighty kindneſs and faithfulneſs for his
friends, which was proof againſt the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy
and viciſſitude of the things of this
World. He was neither diſtruſtful nor ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious.
He eaſily gave credit to the good, but
hardly to the ill that was ſpoken of his Friends.
His Maxim was to ſuſpend his conſent always
to diſadvantagious reports, till ſuch time as
his own experience or infallible demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſhould aſcertain him of the matter they
reported to him. Another maxime of his
friendſhip was never to be troubleſome to his
Friends, yet nevertheleſs to render them all
ſervices he was capable of. Thinking that
this good diſpoſition that reigned in him, might
be inſtead of a rule whereby to judge <hi>that</hi> of
another man, he raiſed the obligation of ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
to ſuch an high pitch, that he pretended
thoſe that did good turns, are alſo the perſons
obliged.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:52044:139"/>
A perſon of his character ſhould not have
had any enemies,<note place="margin">His Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies and Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries.</note> nor indeed had he any but
ſuch who were enemies to Vertue and Truth,
who made Inſurrection not ſo much againſt
his Perſon, as againſt his Writings. The
enmities of others never troubled him: nay,
and without being too Inquiſitive to ſpy out
what Enemies he had, he was content to be
no bodies Enemy. And to be always ready
to be reconciled to thoſe who deſired to come
into favour with him again.</p>
            <p>But he judged it not fit to paſs by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of his Philoſophy, ſome whereof became
his envyers and emulators, and others open ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries;
the little vanity that might be in him,
was without doubt well enough ſatisfied with
the firſt ſort, and his merit could not be more
inhanced, nor ſet off to better advantage, than
by the envy of others. As for his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
whoſe number far ſurpaſt <hi>that</hi> of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vyers,
he never refuſed to anſwer thoſe, who
notwithſtanding their prejudice and ignorance,
diſcovered to him any tokens of honeſty and
ſincerity.</p>
            <p>As he had ſome Adverſaries in his life time,
who, for all that, profeſt, to be his friends.
So, we cannot queſtion but he had ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
to check and reſtrain them, as Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
and Enemies of his intent and purpoſe. In
reſpect of the firſt he had nothing in a manner
beſides his own reaſon to follow, without
fearing any thing from his inclination. But
as for the others, where, it ſeems, his reaſon
could not come in play, it was his beſt way to
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:52044:139"/>
retain his inclination. There was rooted in
him a ſtrong affection for pur-blind people all
his Life time, and was occa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ioned from the
impreſſion made upon his Infancy, at which
time he loved a little pretty Damſel that was
ſomewhat pur-blind.</p>
            <p>What ſome of his Enemies have given out
concerning his pretended inclination to the

               </gap> Sex,<note place="margin">His inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the Sex.</note> ſeems to have been devis'd but only
from a paſſage of the Sieur <hi>Borel,</hi> who teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
that our Philoſopher was not diſpleaſed
with Women's company, becauſe, as to the
buſineſs of Philoſophy, he found them more
tractable, patient, docile, and in a word,
more void of prejudices and falſe doctrines,
that many men.</p>
            <p>The adventure wherewith ſome idle ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
have aſperſt him, about a Lady of <hi>Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine,</hi>
named <hi>La Menaudiere</hi> is a mere fiction,
forged upon a Picture of our Philoſopher, that,
ſhe had ſeen at the houſe of Abbot <hi>de To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laye.</hi>
He never laid his Eyes upon this Lady,
and for her part ſhe had never ſeen him, but
in Picture: but now the caſe was otherwiſe
as to Madam <hi>du Roſai,</hi> whom he Courted juſt
when his Relations had thought of marrying
him, for whom he fought a Duel with a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
of his, encountring him upon the Road
between <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Orleans:</hi> yet this Lady was
heard to confeſs at laſt, that Monſieur <hi>Des
Cartes</hi> found more charms in Philoſophy than
in her: and that altho ſhe did not ſeem ugly
to him, yet he paſt a courſe compliment upon
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:52044:140"/>
her, when he told her, that <hi>he found no beauty
comparable to that of Truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The fault he but once in all his Life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
againſt the honour of his Caelibacy, is
not ſo much a proof of his inclination for the
Sex, as of his weakneſs; and God having been
pleaſed ſpeedily to raiſe him up again, would
have the remembrance of his Fall, to be matter
of continual humiliation to him, and that his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance
ſhould be a wholeſome remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
being exalted above meaſure.</p>
            <p>He recovered by this glorious reinſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">His Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</note>
all the benefits wherewith it pleas'd
God to honour the Vertues of his Soul. Till
that time, he never wanted any of thoſe that
are the ingredients of a Gentleman and an
Honeſt man: and he laboured ſince to deſerve
thoſe that are able to make up a perfect
Chriſtian Philoſopher. Thoſe who knew him
the moſt intimately, have all born witneſs
of the innocency of his Life. They found him
Religious as to his Sentiments, Wiſe in his
demeanour, edifying in all his diſcourſes,
giving examples of purity and integrity, that
were proof againſt the common corruption of
the Age.</p>
            <p>VII.<note place="margin">His opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</note> After we have known what he was in
Converſation with men, and toward himſelf,
it is convenient to know how he demean'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in his relation towards his Creator, what
his Thoughts were about Religion, wherein
his Piety conſiſted, which was very ſincere &amp;
ſolid, and was not allay'd with Bigottry, or
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:52044:140"/>
Faction, in the opinion of perſons of both per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions.</p>
            <p>Never was a Philoſopher obſerved to bear
a more profound reſpect to a Deity, than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
He was alſo ſober about matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
he never mention'd God, but with a great
deal of circumſpection, always with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance
of Wiſdom, always in a noble and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
manner. The fear or rather niceneſs
he ſhew'd in this point, made him ſcrupulouſly
to decline entering upon queſtions of pure di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.
Believing that it was to do wrong to
Truths, that depend on Faith, and cannot be
proved but by natural demonſtration, to go
about to ſtrengthen them by humane reaſons,
and they only probable.</p>
            <p>His blood roſe againſt the boldneſs and
raſhneſs of certain Divines, who run away
from their guides, that is to ſay, from the
holy Scriptures and Fathers of the Primitive
Church, that they may be their own guides,
through thoſe ways that they are not well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with. But above all he blamed the
boldneſs of Philoſophers and Mathematicians,
that dare appear ſo poſitive and peremptory,
in determining <hi>What God can, and what he
cannot do;</hi> he ſaid, it is to ſpeak of God as of
a Jupiter or a Saturn, to make him ſubject to
Styx, or fate, to hold that there are ſome
truths independent on him.</p>
            <p>As concerning the exiſtance of God, he
reſted ſo well ſatisfied in the evidence of that
demonſtration he thought he had found in
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:52044:141"/>
that matter, that made no difficulty to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
it to all the evidences and demonſtrations
of Geometrical Truth. It was moreover his
opinion that the Univerſal conſent of all peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
is ſufficient to maintain a Deity againſt
all the injuries of Atheiſts, and that no pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
perſon ſhould ever enter upon a diſpute
with <hi>them,</hi> except he were ſure of convincing
them.</p>
            <p>It is not much material to call to mind in
this place the calumnies of Atheiſm and
Scepticiſm, wherewithal his Enemies endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to brand him, notwithſtanding all the
ſucceſs he had, in oppoſing Atheiſts and Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks;
one could not poſſibly have opinions,
that he ſtudied to reſute. By a childiſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence
making people believe that he
halted between holding, and refuſing them.</p>
            <p>VIII. The precaution he took along with
him, never to incroach upon Divinity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> went
not quite ſo far as to deny, that humane reaſon
may have any ſhare in Divine Sciences, nay,
and even in <hi>thoſe</hi> that were communicated to
us only by revelation from Heaven. He was
not ſo ignorant of the great benefit of reaſon,
for the eſtabliſhment of Maxims of Religion;
and he was perſuaded that Philoſophy well
improved is one of the main helps to ſupport
and juſtifie faith in an illuminated mind.</p>
            <p>Not that he pretended that a man muſt
needs be a Philoſopher, to be a good Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian:
but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> he thought that albeit the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of a man ſubmits to Faith, nevertheleſs,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:52044:141"/>
Faith makes uſe of humane reaſoning to cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
reaſon, and bring it under ſubjection
to its authour.</p>
            <p>He was perſuaded that his opinions might
prove very ſerviceable for the explaining of
the truths of Faith. He believed that there
could be nothing in whatſoever concerns Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Religion, with which his Philoſophy
would not much better agree than the vulgar
Philoſophy doth. And as for ſome controverſies
frequently agitated in his time in the Divinity
Schools, by reaſon of the falſe principles of
Philoſophy upon which they were grounded,
he hoped they would ceaſe and come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of themſelves. If ever it ſhould ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
that his principles ſhould be admitted
to come in vogue: That which pufft up his
mind the moſt is, that, deſcribing the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
and origen of the World, according to
the principles of natural Philoſophy, and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over the firſt Chapter of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> he found
that it could be all of it expounded <hi>according
to his conceptions,</hi> much better than by all the
ways whereby your interpreters expound it.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs from the appearances only of
his undertaking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from his man<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophizing,
ſeveral have judged that his Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy
was, if not pernicions, at leaſt very
dangerous for Chriſtian Religion, and that it
was equally contrary to the Divinity of Papiſts
and Proteſtants. And that is, the reaſon why
ſome controvertiſts of both perſuaſions, would
fain have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>
               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:52044:142"/>
Men are delivered from theſe apprehenſions
amongſt the Catholicks, except here and
there a few <hi>Peripaticians</hi> hoodwink'd by their
own Prejudices. But the Proteſtants that have
not experienced it ſo favourable to their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
have been a long time without pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
him for broaching it; becauſe he hath not
ſpoken as they do, of the Providence of God,
and of the Liberty of Man: the worſt that they
have been able to diſoblige him in, is, making
him paſs for a <hi>Pelagian;</hi> But their Accuſation
is vaniſhed, they not being able to ground it
upon any Paſſage of his Writings, or upon his
particular Behaviour and Conduct, where the

when they exploded <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> out of their

in that Point leſs conſidered the intereſt of

But he will be for ever honourable for his

underſtand that it hath been ſo powerful as
to Convert <hi>Huguenots</hi> to the Faith of the
Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> even as his manner of
ſpeaking about Religion hath brought ſome
Profeſs'd Atheiſts over to the ſaid Church.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God hath ſuffered Calumny

him of Calviniſm: and ſome Calviniſts again,
out of a piece of Malice, would fain have
done themſelves the honour to count him one
of them: But their Slanders have been invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
by the Teſtimonies of a great number
of Perſons of both Perſwaſions, by the Queen

Seal of the Communion of Saints.</p>
            <p>This Juſtice was a Debt owing to ſuch a
Religious Obſerver of the Cannons of the
Church as our Philoſopher was.<note place="margin">His Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Piety.</note> Never did
he want Zeal for her; yet was not his, a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided,
blind Zeal, never was he aſhamed,
publickly to profeſs his Catholiciſm amongſt
Societies ſeparated from the Church: never
did there eſcape from his Pen or Mouth any
term that ſavoured of liberty or irreverence
touching certain Rites and Cuſtoms of our
Church, upon which Philoſophers and Wits
do uſually play, and make ſport; the reſpect
that he entertained for the Goſpel-Miniſtry of
the Proteſtant Divines never made him utter
a word that ſmell'd of Complaiſance, or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
for Schiſm or Hereſie.</p>
            <p>The Caution whereto he had confin'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
upon his firſt entrance into Countries
profeſſing a different Religion, had made him
ſo diſcreet and reſerved, that he ſcarce ever
opened his Mouth without edifying, nor with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

            <p>His carriage and behaviour was no leſs edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying
than his diſcourſe he did not make, all
the Duties requiſite to a true Chriſtian to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,
in an inward worſhip only, as moſt part
of your Philoſophers do; no, he was extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
careful to accompany it with all the
exerciſes of a good conſciencious Catholick;
nay, and he acquitted himſelf of all his Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:52044:143"/>
as exactly as one of the humbleſt and
plaineſt of Believers would have done. He
frequented more eſpecially the Sacraments of
Pennance and Euchariſt, with all the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of a contrite heart, and humbled ſpirit;
as far as is permitted to refer our ſelves to the
honeſty and truth of Confeſſors, who had the
cure of his Soul in <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Sweden.</hi>

            <p>His adhering ſo cloſely to the whole Body
of the Church,<note place="margin">His Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the Church.</note> whereof himſelf was a Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
was kept up by a ſincere ſubmiſſion to
its authority without any reſerve. He decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
no ſmall <hi>deference</hi> for whatſoever bore
the Character, or but the Name of the Holy
See; He harboured very great eſteem for
the <hi>Sorbonne;</hi> that is to ſay, for the whole
Faculty of Divinity in <hi>Paris,</hi> that he reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
as the <hi>Depoſitory</hi> of the Key of Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;
Knowing that the Key of Power was
in the hands of the Pope and of Biſhops,
which made him firmly believe that his
Conſcience ſhould be ſecure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo long as
he ſhould have <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Sorbonne</hi> on
his ſide.</p>
            <p>His Submiſſion to the Holy See did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
even ſo far as to have ſome reſpect
for the Roman Inquiſition, although he
was no where in a <hi>Praemunire,</hi> whereby
to become liable to its laſh. He was not
ignorant of the difference one ought to put
between the Pope's Authority, and <hi>that</hi> of
the Congregation eſtabliſhed at <hi>Rome</hi> for
prohibited Books: yet did he not fail to
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:52044:144"/>
teſtifie reſpect for it, and to ſay, out of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
that it's Authority had little leſs power
over his Actions, than his own Reaſon had
over his Thoughts, and he took all meaſures
neceſſary, not to write any thing that might
incurr its diſpleaſure; it is more than probable
that this Congregation would have ſpared
him, if it could have got clear from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues
of a particular Author who had cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ningly
ſlipt one part of his Works into the
<hi>Index Expurgatorius,</hi> amongſt a Catalogue of

            <p>X.<note place="margin">Of the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Novelty in his Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> It is poſſible they could not deviſe a more
ſpecious pretence to cenſure and reject him,
than <hi>that</hi> of <hi>Novelty,</hi> which men believes
might have amounted to a Crime; this,
perhaps (amongſt all thoſe they could impute
to him) is the only one wherewith they could
moſt reaſonably have charged him. To ſpeak
the truth, he did not ſo much boggle at
Novelty as they do, who fondly adore the
Ancients; he judged that in Philoſophy,
where the buſineſs is only the reſearch of
natural Truths, that have not hitherto been
Diſcovered, it might be pardonable to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
new means; eſpecially ſince the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
have had the ill luck not to diſcover
them to us. Beſides, his Spirit was not of
the temper of thoſe upo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> whom two or
three Thouſand years are capable to impreſs
a Veneration for Error. He was ſure that
the ancienteſt things that have been received
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:52044:144"/>
by Poſterity; were new, at their firſt appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance:
and if Novelty had been an Obſtacle
to their Reception, one ſhould never have
received any thing into the World.</p>
            <p>But, ſince men are engaged upon honour,
not any longer to confound Novelty with
Falſhood, nor Antiquity with Truth, Envy
that could not endure that Monſieur <hi>Des Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
ſhould paſs Scot-free, hath gone about to
change the Scene, and invert this order to
bring him in guilty; his defenders that plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Cauſe, that they might retort the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of Novelty, did take upon them to
make appear that his Opinions were not ſo
Novel as they would make them, and that,
ſeveral of them had been defeated before
him; thoſe that envied him, who thought
all to be new, till that time, were not
wanting to make their beſt advantage of
this Overture, and have been ready to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
him for having robb'd the Ancients, nay,
and the Moderns too, who went before him;
for it is the opinion of ſome, that he ſtole
his Method of <hi>Algebra</hi> from one <hi>Harriot,</hi> an
Engliſhman.</p>
            <p>The multitude of thoſe who ſeem to have
had before him ſorry Sentiments reſembling
his,<note place="margin">His meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with thoſe that preceded him.</note> may very well ſerve to inhaunce the
value of his Philoſophy, and ſerve to let
men judge of the importance of the new
things he hath ſuperadded, both to Correct
or Perfect that which was but only rudely
drawn, or but ventured at before his time,
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:52044:145"/>
without any Method, without any Principles:
But this ſignifies nothing to prove him to be
the Plagiary of ſo many Authors, the moſt
part of which, it is well known, were ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
unknown to him. This Multitude, I
ſay, makes us the more inclinable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that he found out more than all theſe
Philoſophers put together; and that he hath
been more happy and ſucceſsful than them
all, in matter of Probability and Solidity,
for the eſtabliſhing his Principles, and the
curious Connexion of his Conſequences. His
Syſtem is, in all reſpects ſo compleat, and
ſo well furniſhed, that one muſt not think
it ſtrange, that whatſoever hath been the
moſt plauſibly fancied by both Ancients and
Moderns, is there couched and rectified, that
there is little need of feigning that he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
it from their Writings.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>Des Cartes</hi> agreeing to what is
commonly objected, that what he ſaid might
poſſibly have been ſaid by ſome other be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him, judged that his Caſe was the ſame
with a man, whom they ſhould tax for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
plunder'd the Alphabet and Dictiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
becauſe he might not have made uſe
of any Letters that were not in the former,
nor of any words that were not found in
the latter; But he adds further, That thoſe
who ſhould pleaſe to own and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the neat Concatenation of all his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions
that do ſo neceſſarily follow one
another, would be induc't preſently to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:52044:145"/>
that he might be as innocent of the
Felony laid to his charge, as an excellent
Oratour, that might be condemned for a
Plagiary of <hi>Calepin,</hi> or old <hi>Evander,</hi> for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
borrowed Words from the one, and
Letters from the other.</p>
            <p>The main, and only difficulty that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd
to be removed out of the way by
the Carteſians, conſiſted, in alledging that a
man comes a Day after the Fair in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
of a thing, when it hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
invented to his hand. But, pray con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
that Experience ſhapes us an Anſwer
in behalf of them, (<hi>viz.</hi>) That the very
ſame thing, may be invented more than
once at different times and in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
by Perſons that might not have learnt
any thing from one another, nor might have
had the leaſt Communication together. <q>M.
<hi>Des Cartes</hi> makes it evident, that it is not
much material<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to his purpoſe for being
the firſt, or the laſt, in writing the things
he writ, provided only they might be
true.</q> He hath not the vanity to boaſt
that he was <hi>the firſt Inventer</hi> of any thing he
hath advanced. He is content to tell us, that
if he received, and admitted of them, it was
not becauſe they were produced, or not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by others; but only and principally
becauſe reaſon had perſwaded him of their
being true.</p>
            <p>In a word, he was not one of thoſe reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
byaſſed Spirits that are afraid leſt ſome
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:52044:146"/>
body ſhould rob them of their Inventions:
nay, his Judgment was, that a noble gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Soul ought not to complain of Plagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
robbing of him, provided they do not
wholly conceal and ſuppreſs their Theft; in
caſe they do not ſpoil him, and that the
Publick be not fruſtrated thereby. He hath
left to Poſterity very fair Examples of that
Generoſity and Diſ-intereſt which he exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
from others upon ſuch Occaſions: In
reſpect of two Hollanders, who turn'd Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giaries
of his Writings; and that, before he
had Communicated them to the Publick,
he thought it ſufficient to take all neceſſary
Praecautions againſt the Vain-glory of the
one, and Treachery of the other. That
done, he committed the reſt to God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty,
as the ſole Author of whatſoever
good there might be found in his Writings,
without challenging any thing in them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
defects; which Ignorance and Humane
Infirmity might there have produced.</p>
