            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The rather, because they are the far major part (above six times as many as those that sate and shut them out) and would no wayes have consented to this illegall Tax, or undue manner of imposing it, without the Lords concurrence, had they been present. And, I my self, being both an unjustly imprisonsd and secluded Member, and neither of the Knights of the County of <hi>Somerset,</hi> where I live, present or consenting to this Tax or Act, one or both of them being forced thence by the Army, I conceive neither my self, nor the County where I live, nor the Borough for which I served, in the least measure bound by this Act or Tax, but cleerly exempted from them, and obliged with all our might and power effectually to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them.</p>

            <p>If any object, That true it is, the parliament by the common Law and Custome of the Realm determines by the Kings death; but by the Statute of 17 <hi>Caroli,</hi> which enacts, <hi>That
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29769:7"/>
this present Parliament now assembled shall not be dissolved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse it be by Act of Parliament to be passed for that purpose;</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues this Parliament still in being, notwithstanding the Kings beheading, since no Act of Parliament is passed for its Dissolution. The only pretext for to support the continuance of the Parliament since the Kings violent death.</p>
            <p>To this I answer, That it is a Maxime in Law, <hi>That every</hi>
               <note place="margin">Answ.</note> 
               <hi>Statute ought to be expounded according to the intent of those that made it, and the mischiefs it intended onely to prevent,</hi> as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved in 4. <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. 12. 12. <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. 18. 1. <hi>H.</hi> 7 12 13. <hi>Plowd. Com fol.</hi> 369. and <hi>Cooks</hi> 4. <hi>Instit. p.</hi> 329, 330. Now the intent of the Makers of this Act, and the end of enacting it, was not to prevent the dissolution of this Parliament by the Kings death (no ways intimated or insinuated in any clause thereof, being a cleer unavoydable dissolution of it to all intents not provided for by this Law,) but by any Writ or proclamation of the King, by his Regal power, without consent of both Houses; which I shall ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest by these ensuing reasons.</p>
            <p n="1">First, From the principal occasion of making this Act. The King (as the COMMONS in their <note n="*" place="margin">Exact Collect. p. 5. 6.</note>

Now the fear of preventing of the like dissolution, prorogation, or adjournment of this Parliament after the Scotish Armies disbanding, before the things mentioned in the Preamble were effected by the Kings absolute power, was the only ground &amp; occasion of this Law (not any fear or thoughts of its dissolution by the King untimely death) then not so much as imagined, being before the Warrs or Irish Rebellion brake forth) the King very healthy, not ancient, and likely then to survive this Parliament, and many others, in both Houses judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as appears by the Bill for trienniall Parliaments. This un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Truth is expresly declared by the Commons themselves in their foresaid <hi>Romonstrance; Exact Collection</hi> p. 5. 6. 14. 17. compared together; where in direct terms they affirm, <hi>The</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:29769:8"/>
ABBRUPT DISSOLUTION OF THIS PARLIAMENT <hi>is prevented</hi> by another Bil, by which it is provided it shall not be dissolved or adjourned without the consent of both Houses: <hi>In the Bill for continuance of this present Parliament,</hi> there seems <hi>TO BE SOME RESTRAINT OF THE ROYAL POW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ER IN D SSOLVING OF PARLIAMENTS; NOT TO TAKE IT OUT OF THE CROWN, BUT TO SUSPEND THE EXECUTION OF IT FOR THIS TIME</hi> and <hi>OCCASION ONLY;</hi> which was so necessary for <hi>THE KINGS OWN SECURITY,</hi> and the <hi>publick Peace, that without it we could not have undertaken any of these great charges, but must have left both the Armies to disorder and confusion, and the whole Kingdom to blood and rapine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which passages we have a clear resolution of the Commons themselves, immediately after the passing of this Act; that the scope and intention of it was only to provide against the Kings <hi>abrupt dissolution of the Parliament by the meer royall power in suspending the execution of it for this ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:29769:15"/>
disbanding it, or the greatest part of it, for these reasons: 1. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Kingdom is generally exhausted with the late 7 years Wars, Plunders and heavy Taxes; there being more moneyes levied on it by both sides, during these eight last yeares, then in all the Kings Reigns since the Conquest, as will appear upon a just computation: all Counties being thereby utterly unable to pay it. 2. In regard of the great decay of Trade, the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary dearth of cattell, corn, and provisions of all sorts; the charge of relieving a multitude of poor people, who starve with famine in many places, the richer sort eaten out by Taxes and Free-quarter, being utterly unable to relieve them. To which I might adde the multitude of maimed Souldiers, with the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows and children of those who have lost their lives in the Wars, which is very costly. 3. This heavie Contribution to support the Army, destroies all Trade, by fore-stalling and engrossing most of the Monies of the Kingdom, the sinews and life of Trade; wasting the provisions of the Kingdom, and enhancing their prices, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many thousands of able men and horses idle, only to consume other labouring mens provisions, estates, and the publick Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure of the Kingdom, when as their employment in their Trades and callings, might much advance trading, and enrich the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. 4. There is now no visible Enemy in the field or Garrisons, and the sitting Members boast there is no fear from any abroad, their Navie being so Victorious. And why such a vast Army should be still continued in the Kingdom to increase its debts and payments, when charged with so many great Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears and Debts already, eat up the Country with Taxes and Free-quarter, only to play, drink, whore, steale, rob, murther, quarrell, fight with, impeach and shoot one another to death as Traitors, Rebels, and Enemies to the Kingdom and Peoples Liberties, as now the <hi>Levellers</hi> and <hi>Cromwellists</hi> doe, for want of other imployments, and this for the publick Good, transcends my understanding. 5. When the King had two great Armies in the Field, and many Garisons in the Kingdom, this whole Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my by its primitive Establishment, consisted but of twenty two thousand Horse, Dragoons and Foot, and had an Establishment only of about Fortie five thousand pounds a month for their pay; which both Houses then thought sufficient, as is evident by their<note n="(o)" place="margin">Collect. &amp;c. pag. 599. 876.</note> Ordinances of <hi>Febr.</hi> 15. 1644. and <hi>April</hi> 4. 1646.

when the Army was much increased without their Order, sixty thousand pounds a month was thought abundantly sufficient by the Officers and Army themselves, to disband and reduce all su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-numeraries, maintain the Established Army and Garisons, and ease the Country of all Free-quarter; which Tax hath been constantly paid in all Counties. Why then this Tax to the Army should now be raised above the first Establishment, when redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to twenty thousand, whereof sundry Regiments are designed for <hi>Ireland,</hi> (for which there is thirty thousand pounds a month now exacted, besides the sixty for the Army) and this for the common good of the Realm, is a riddle unto me, or rather, a Mystery of iniquity, for some mens private lucre, rather then the publick weal. 6.

Therefore there is no necessity to keep up this Army, or impose any new Tax for their maintenance, or defraying their pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Arrears, which I dare averr, the Free-quarter they have taken in kinde, and levied in money, if brought to a just account, as it ought, will double, if not treble most of their Arrears, and make them much indebted to the Country. And no reason they should have full pay and Free-quarter too, and the Country bear the burthen of both, without full allowance of all the Quarters levied or taken on them against Law, out of their pretended Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rears.</p>

the chairs, stools, meat, drink about the house; assaulted my Sister, and her little children, and Maid-servants with their naked swords, threatning to kill them, and kick them to gelly, shot at them with their Musquets, forced them out of the house to save their lives: which I hearing of, repaired to my house, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them all so Bedlam mad, and that they would not hearken to any reason, nor be quieted, I thereupon rode to seek their Captain and Officers at <hi>Bath,</hi> who purposely absented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves: and not finding them till the next morning, I acquainted the Captain then (as I had done the first night by Letter) with all these unsufferable outrages of the Souldiers (contrary to the Generals Order to carry themselves civilly in their Quarters, and abuse none in word or deed) which would render him and them odious, not onely to the Country and Kingdom, but all Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and Souldiers who had any civility in them, and be a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paragement to the <hi>Generall,</hi> by whose Proclamation he ought to be present with his Company, to keep them in good order, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of cashiering: And therefore I expected and required Justice and Reparations at his hands; the rather, because I was informed by some of his own Souldiers and others, that they had not been so barbarously rude, but by his incouragement: which if he refused, I should complain of him to his Superiours, and right my self the best way I might. After some expostulations, he promised to make them examples, and cashier them, and remove them forthwith from my house: But the onely right I had, was, that more of his Company repaired thither, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king all the spoil they could, and taking away some brasse and Pewter, continuing there till neer four of the clock; and then marched away onely out of fear I would raise the Country upon them; many of whom profered me their assistance: but I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired them to forbear till I saw what their Officers would do; who in stead of punishing any of them, permitted them to play the like <hi>Rex</hi> almost in other places where they quartered since, marching but three or four miles a day, and extorting what mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney they could from the Country by their violence and disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.

In few words; As long as we keep an Army on foot, we must never expect to be exempted from Free-quarter or Wars, or to enjoy any peace or setlement: and as long as we wil submit to pay contributions to support an Army, we shall be certain our new Lords and Governors will continue an Army to over-aw and enslave us to their wils.

            <p>If then their Principal admirers, who confederated with the Army, and those now sitting, in all their late proceedings; and cryed them up most of any, as the Parliament and supreme Authority of <hi>England</hi> before, at, and since the late force upon the House, and its violent purgation, do thus in print professed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly disclaim them, for being any real <hi>Parliament</hi> or House of <hi>Commons,</hi> to make <hi>Acts</hi> or impose <hi>Taxes</hi> upon the people; the secluded <hi>Members, Presbyterians, Royallists,</hi> and all others, have much more cause and ground to disavow and oppose their usurped Parliamentary authority and illegal Taxes, Acts, as not made by any true <hi>English Parliament,</hi> but a <hi>Mock-Parliament</hi> only.</p>
