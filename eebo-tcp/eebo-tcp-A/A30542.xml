            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas <hi>Philip Taverner</hi> one of Truths Opposers (whether through igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or subtilty I now determine not) hath again appeared against me, and Truth in Print, as in vindication of himself and his former work, who a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout four months ago gave a false re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a Dispute, but instead of mending the matter, he hath made his own cause the more vile, as may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to such who takes a perfect view of the proceedings, from the beginning to the end thereof; row the intent of this my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply is to clear the Truth further, and to take off h<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s false aspersi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which he hath cast upon my innocent words in my former Book, in answer to his first. And as for the rest of his Book, which hath no relation to mine, nor to the Dispute, I shall pass it by. The Title of my first Book was, <hi>Something of Truth made
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:45419:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
manifest, &amp;c. To which saist thou, a plausible title to cover a rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and bitter Spirit under, that it may walk in the world less sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> My words are truth, for in that book truth was made manifest to many in relation to the former dispute, to the satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of many, and as for rayling and bitterness of spirit, I do deny, only I am zealous for the Lords truth, to speak plainly by reproving them that gain-say it, and to that of God in every mans conscience, do I desire to be manifest and seeks, not by flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering words to cover evil, that I may not be suspected, though thou seem falsly to say it, but let all my enemies suspect what they will, for of the Lord do I seek to stand approved, and not of man, for the <hi>Jew inward,</hi> hath no praise of man, but of God, and as for rayling language and bitter words against thee I have used none, but speaks the truth in plainness.</p>
            <p>The next thing thou seems to stumble at is, whereas I said, <hi>I supposed thou hadst Ambitiously stiled thy selfe, Mr. Phillip Taver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,</hi> and thou now seeks to hide thy self from the force of my words, to the sight of the world, which appears a little to strike upon thee, with some shame; And thou saist, <hi>thou did not prefix Mr. before thy name, but the Stationer did it, who (saist thou) was pleased to honour the man with that title, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Now instead of clearing himself, he hath shewed more guilt of ambition then before, and my words were, <hi>I supposed,</hi> and not an absolute charge as he saith, and had not I good reason to suppose it, that it was his ambition, being also contrary to the express command of Christ, <hi>Mat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 23. And indeed I hardly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver read any subscription like to it, by the greatest, and noblest of men, as men account, and it is a thing far above humility, and not beseeming any man, much less one that professes himself to be a Minister of Christ <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o subscribe himself, or be with his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, <hi>Mr. such an one,</hi> but he seems to cover himself from am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, because saith he, <hi>he did it not himself</hi> but another, I say, I shall not charge him here with falsehood, but I am sure it is very unusual for any man to add any thing to another mans book, without his knowledg; I never knew it done by any Stationer, who hath had some knowledg of their wayes: but yet he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges it was done in honour to him, to subscribe him <hi>Master,</hi> and here he hath Justified the thing, and shewed that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed guilty of ambition, who confesseth that it is an honour to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:45419:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
him, to be subscribed <hi>Mr.</hi> by another; for he saith, <hi>the man that did it honoured him with that title</hi>; and here men may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice what honour this my adversary looks after, even the honor that Christ forbids, who saith to his ministers, be not ye called of men masters; but the man hath honoured <hi>Phil. Taverner</hi> with titling him <hi>Mr.</hi> as he saith.</p>
            <p>The next thing treated; proves also that he is ambitious, for he pleads much the lawfulness of titles, of <hi>civil respects,</hi> as he calls it; And this is all to justifie the title of master to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, and thereupon hath wrested divers scr<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ptures; what though the unbeleeving Greeks, used the word Master, or Sir; John. 12. which he hath quoted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> is this an example sufficient for Christians to break the command of Christ? <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.10. neither are any other Scriptures a warrant for any man so to do, though for a whole page he treats only as for the lawfulness of such titles, yet in the end would shut guilt from his own door, that he affects not titles.</p>
            <p>For he saith, this he speaks not <hi>that he would have it so done to him</hi>; and this his seeming justifying himself proves himself guilty, knowing that he had given truly occasion for people to judg he would have it so, and in the end would blind the minds of the simple with words of seeming humility, that he would not have it so done to him, as if he cared not for it.</p>
            <p>And whereas I said in my first, that <hi>I am without any prejudice towards the man (viz.) P. T.</hi> he saith <hi>I must give him leave to question it; first, from my rayling words against him; secondly from my scornful pitty expressed, &amp;c. saith he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> I have no prejudice against him, God is my witness, and he may question what he will, who is in the unb<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lief; for its manifest by his former, that he quest<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ons where he hath no just occasion, shewing much prejudice in himself, for he said in his first relation, commenting upon some of my words, if by such words, I meant so<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then it was <hi>truth</hi>; but if I meant so, then it was <hi>false</hi>; and was not this a perfect sign of prejudice in him, who had not just occasion to except against the words as they lay; nor could not condemn them but upon giving his own Interpretation of them first; whereupon I said, in my first answer, page 14. <hi>Alas poor man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> must I be judged upon thy own meaning, &amp;c.</hi> and yet in these words I shewed no scornful pitty to him, though he fa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sly suppose it, and say it, and so while he cannot believe that I am without
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:45419:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
prejudice against him, he hath shewed himself guilty of prejudice towards me, and my words, to be seen, and justly believed by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>
            <p>And whereas he saith, <hi>it is doubtful how far I own the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Scriptures,</hi> because I say in my first, <hi>we through patience and comfort of the Scriptures have had hope: have had hope saith he,</hi> now it seems because I place my words, <hi>we have had hope,</hi> his unbelieving doubtful heart questions whether I own the Authority of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and would falsly conclude, that through the comfort of Scripture we have no hope now, and saith he, <hi>are you now flown so high that you need not? &amp;c.</hi> page 3. and therefore I may now answer further; yea through the promise of the Lord, declared in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, <hi>we have hope</hi> at this present, that God will bring down, and overthrow all such that deceives the people, who are made Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters by man, and of man, at Schools and Colledges, and all this set maintenance by Tithes, and casting people into Prison, and spoyling their goods to maintain Ministers, as this day in the nation, many hundreds have been cast into prison, and many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds worth of Cattel, of bedding, and all kind of goods have been distrained for to maintain the Ministry, I say we have hope according to the Scriptures, that God will bring down all this, and your preaching for mony, and bargaining with people for so much the year, and your preaching what you have studied for, from the Scriptures, by a glass in a steeple-house, where the Mass use to be said, God will confound all this, and poor peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shall be delivered from the mouths of those deceivers that makes a prey upon them, and preaches for hire, and seeks for their gain from their quarter; and these things with many other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we hope at this present, wherefore think not in thy self, we now do not hope; for we both do and have had hope, through patience, and comfort of the Scriptures.</p>
            <p>Whereas I charged <hi>P. T.</hi> in my last, <hi>that he had wronged both me, and the truth in his Relation,</hi> &amp;c. which he saith in his answer is false, and he saith <hi>he doth not apprehend me and the truth, so well agreed, that it is possible to wrong us both ot once</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. page the 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> That he wronged me it appears, in his not relating all that I said at the dispute (the ground of this quarrel) not by half and more I know, and in relating more then himself spoke by far; and let sober men judge, whether he did not here worng me, in
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:45419:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
relating a thing that passed between us, and relating much more then ever he spoke, and much less then I spoke, if the truth of that matter (were it wrong or right matter) and my self also be not by this kind of dealing wronged, I appeal to all honest peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whilst both he and I am silent; so the false dealing and wrong in his first book, is upon him still according to my charge unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and the lie in this his last book, in that he saith, <hi>I say falsly,</hi> when I have spoken the truth, which is a lie in the highest degree, in saying when I spoke the truth, that I spoke falsly; and his proof in that; <hi>the truth and I doth not agree,</hi> is; because I said in my first, <hi>the Saints have no need of Scriptures to teach them, but the Spirit of the Father leadeth, and teacheth into all truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> My words are Justifiable, for it is the Spirit that <hi>lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into all truth, Iohn.</hi> 16. and the Saints <hi>need no man to teach them, but they have the anointing within them,</hi> and they know all things by the unction, 1 <hi>John.</hi> and the Spirit of the Father is given them, by which the Scriptures were given forth, <hi>and the Lord is the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of his people,</hi> and they need not any to say to them, know the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. yet they that witness this, do not make the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of none effect, but owns it in its place, yet not as their <hi>teacher,</hi> for then they should deny the new covenant, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31. and then something besides the Spirit leads into truth, and they have something to teach them besides the anointing, but if this be all the proof that can be given against me, <hi>that I and the truth doth not agree,</hi> I doubt not but all spiritual men, will see the emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiness and weakness, of the witness against me; and will be more confirmed, rather then shaken, that I and the truth doth fully agree, though <hi>P, T.</hi> speaks otherwise falsly against me.

            <p>And also the Scripture doth testifie the Saints were already perfect and compleat in Christ, while they were in the life upon earth, <hi>Col.</hi> 1. though there be a time, wherein all the Saints do complain of the body of sin, in their warfare, and travell, yet there is a state also, wherein they have put off the body of sin, and are the servants of righteousness, and free from sin, <hi>Rom</hi> 6.22.

            <p>And whereas, <hi>I said the light, which every man is lightned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al by Christ, is sufficient, to bring up every man to believe in Christ, that loves the light and walks in it, and unto such is grace added, and increased daily, &amp;c.</hi> as in the 16 pag. of my first, more appears.</p>
            <p>In opposition to this, to over throw it, as he supposes, he hath nominated that Scripture, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. the Natural man per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to him, neither can he know them, because they are spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally discrened, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Now my words are true, and no contradiction to the Apostles words, except to such as are blind, that cannot discern between light and darkness, and such will judge falsly, and out of an evill mind make an appearance of seeming difference, where
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:45419:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
there is none, for the light, that lighteth every man that comes into the world, is Christ, <hi>John</hi> 1.9. and that Christ the light that lighteth every man that comes into the word, is sufficient to bring every man, that loves the light, and walks in it, to believe in Christ; these are my words, and the intent of my mind, and would any man, that were not stark blind, make any opposition against this doctrine, or bring a Scripture to prove the contrary? which Scripture I own, and doth no way contradict, for the natural man doth not perceive the things of God, nor know them; yet this is not contrary to what I say, that Christ Jesus lighteth every man that comes in the world, which light, (Christ) <hi>is sufficient,</hi> and he changeth men from Natural to spiritual, as they are brought to beleeve in Christ that hath lightned them; and he opposes me, as if I should say, or hold forth that the Natural man perceives, and knows the things of God, and that the natural man hath faith; which I never spoke, nor entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my mind to say; so he hath drawn his evill consequence from my words, and then confounded his own Conception; but my words remains untouched, for my saying and intent is, that Christ lighteth every man that comes into the world, and his light is sufficient, to give faith, and to change a man, from natural to spiritural, and to give him the perceiving and knowledge of the things of God, and of his spirit; and my words, nor intent is no contradiction to the Apostles words, though <hi>P. T.</hi> falsly judged so, for want of better understanding, I suppose rather than through subtilty at this turn; and thus my principle is proved sound, and the title of his book a lie.</p>
            <p>And whereas I said, <hi>that Christ wrought righteousness perfectly without us, and also fulfils righteousness in all that believes, and no man is justified by one of these, without the other, or that hath not the other, pag.</hi> 12. of my first.</p>
            <p>He saith, <hi>whether I do not confound justification, and sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he leaves all rational men to judge,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> That Christ wrought righteousness without us, is not denied by him, nor that he fulfils the righteousness of the Law in the Saints, he cannot well deny, let him read <hi>Rom</hi> 8.4. and that no man is justified by the righteousness that Christ wrought with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, who beleeves not, nor is converted to God, but in the power of Satan; this all the Children of God beleeves, and knowes, that none are justified, by Christs righteousness with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:45419:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but who are converted to God and hath received Christ, and he is in them, for else they are rebrobates, and not justified; and so I am not ashamed of my principle, though he would slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, to be too light, for he that hath not Christ, Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness within him, is a reprobate, and not justified, by any righteousness without; neither do <hi>I confound justification, and sanctification,</hi> which he falsly charges me with, for they are one in Christ, for he is made unto us sanctification and justification, and the man, that is in the pollutions of the world, unsanctified, is not justified, but condemned, so none are justisted by a righteousness without them, but them that are sanctified by him within; this I own, and do not deny, and men that are in the save corrupt reason, with him must not I be judged by, and also I do justifie, if any work be wrought by us, <hi>in the strength and power of grace, and not in our own strength,</hi> then it is the work of Christ in us, the work of Gods own righteousness, and that no work or word is justified, but what the spirit of Christ, leads un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; and though <hi>P. T.</hi> ignorantly commenteth upon these words, yet are they words of truth and righteousness, and all that he saies against them, proves not the contrary.</p>
            <p>And whereas, I did ask him, which he had ignorantly affirmed in his Relation; <hi>VVhether that righteousness which Christ works in us, in his strength and power, and not in our own, is called our righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness?</hi> which he seems to answer, but he hath mis-understood my words, for I meant not <hi>Ours</hi> by enjoyment, but <hi>Ours</hi> in the sence the Prophet speaks, when he said our Righteousness is as filthy Raggs; I know the Righteousness that Christ works in us, by his Spirit, and the power of his Grace, is <hi>Ours</hi> by enjoyment in the second <hi>Adam,</hi> as the gift of God to us, but not <hi>Ours</hi> in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> in the righteousness of the Law, in the state not converted, and that was the strength of my Query, where that Righteousness wrought in us, by the Spirit and strength of Christ, and not in our own, is called our Righteousness, ours as in the first <hi>Adam</hi>; but I see thou hast not understood the meaning of my Query, for weakness of understanding, and then how should thou rightly answer it.</p>
            <p>Also I Queried, <hi>How Christ working Righteousness in us, by the power of grace, not by our own strength, can be called the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of the Law,</hi> which he had affirmed; now I meant the righteousness of the Law in the flesh, and not in the Spirit, I know
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:45419:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the working of Christ, both in us, to will, and to do, by his Spirit, and strength, and power of Grace, is the fulfilling the righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Law by Christ in us; but it is not the righteousness of the Law in the flesh wrought by us, as unborn again; but to this thou hast not answered, but hast answered thy own conceiving, and not the innocency of my Queries.</p>
            <p>And whereas he stumbles, and is offended, because I said, <hi>No man is justified in any word, or work, but what they are lead unto by the Spirit, and those words and works the Spirit leads unto, are ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stified,</hi> and no other words or works, and from this he would falsely conjecture, I hold a justification by works; and by some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without, or besides that which Christ wrought without. I say no, by the deeds of the Law, shall no flesh living be justified, but yet he that moveth and leadeth into words and works of Truth, and Righteousness, the same doth justifie the Creature in the words and works which he is lead unto, and this is not in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position to the Apostles words, which he seems to bring against me, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8, 9. <hi>Whiles we were sinners, Christ dyed for us, much more being justified by his blood, we shall be saved from the wrath</hi>; this is not contrary to what I say, for we do own the blood of Jesus to justifie, but yet not such who are not cleansed by it, and lead by the Spirit into all truth, but it is they that are justified on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who are lead into all Truth by the Spirit, such are justified by his blood in the Spirit, and saved from wrath, who are born of the immortal Word, but they that remain in sin are not justified, nor saved from wrath.</p>
            <p>Then he Queries, <hi>VVhether I shut pardon of sin out of doors?</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer no, for they that are lead into all Truth by the Spirit, their sins are pardoned and forgiven, and remembred no more, but blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out, and cannot be read, for they are cleansed from it, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits not sin; then he asks, <hi>VVhether I grant two formal causes of Iustification, the one forgiveness of sin, the other inherent righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi>; I say, both the cause and the work of Righteousness is in God, his free love and mercy, which is over all his works, and they receive the work of it, and the gift of it that are lead by the Spirit, as the effect thereof, and none else, though he ask, <hi>VVhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgiveness of sin hath its rice from what Christ works in us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or from what Christ hath done and suffered for us</hi>?

               <hi>Reply.</hi> All that I charge to be guilty are so, for I charge not the guiltless, but ask the country people; ask them how many of their teachers are clear, and hath not money, Tyths, or other things for preaching; and I have taken heed of condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the righteous; and yet dare not let the guilty go unjudged and unreproved; and therefore them I do reprove; and now in the end he hath justified preaching for hire, though he in the same page seemed to deny it; but whether is that a maintenance according to Gospel ministery; as practised in the dayes of Christ and his Apostles; or whether that comes not under the account of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for hire, in taking <hi>gifts of the State, and gifts of persons,</hi> which thou justifies; no such maintenance did Christ alow to his ministers as to take sums of money yearly for preaching, nor such things never were justified by Christ: <hi>but into whatsoever house you enter, eat such things as are set before you,</hi> saith Christ: and that is <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams</hi> practices, <hi>to take gifts</hi> of the State; or of great men, for he would have taken the gift of <hi>Balaac</hi>; so by their own account the best sort of Englands teachers, (for some of them thou pleads not for) <hi>goes for gifts and rewards,</hi> as the false brethren did in the daies of the Apostle; for though you would seem to clear them of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>for hire</hi>; yet hast thou proved them guilty, of preaching for <hi>gifts and rewards</hi>; and is not their taking <hi>gifts from the State, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons,</hi> which thou justifies, a perfect preaching for gifts and rewards, as ever the false brethren, which the true Apostls declared against; and so out of thy own mouth, they are proved such, (even the best of them which thou vindicates) as goes in <hi>Balaams way,</hi> preaching for gifts and rewards; and is it not time now for people to cease from you, who are found by thy own confession, in <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laams way,</hi> and the way of the false Apostles; preaching for gifts and rewards <hi>from persons, and from the State</hi>; and so out of thy own mouth I am justified; and your selves condemned.</p>

               <hi>Reply.</hi> It appears true through all the nation, that people are not gathered to God, for doth not wickedness a bound, and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shew forth an unconverted state, and what though many may out of Hypocrisie, and for ends to themselves, cry against sin in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and live themselves in the same, people hereby is not profi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the people, for while themselves live in that which they cry against in others, the power of the Lord is not with them, to convert sinners; but for a better discovery of the teachers of this generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I refer the Reader to a book, called, <hi>A just and lawful tryal of the Teachers, &amp;c.</hi> wherein they are set forth what they are at large.</p>
            <p>The next thing he hath observed; is where I charged him in my last, to have given a relation of much more than he spake, said I; I believe four times as much; and much less then I spake at that dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; &amp; at this he seems to be offended, yet confesseth himself guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but not guilty so much as four times; well, but many that were there present who have not forgotten the matter, may truly seal to my charge in this particular; &amp; he seems not to clear himself at all, but is forced to confess himself guilty by silence, that he related not so much by far as I spoke; and yet called his relation a faithful account; but was thereby proved unfaithful, though now he would seem to cover himself and blame me, for charging him too deeply; but my words remains true upon him; that his former work, was <hi>neither perfect nor altogether honest</hi>; and in this he hath no whit amended it, but the rather made his weakness more ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, as the honest reader may judge.</p>
            <p>Then whereas I charged him, <hi>with a vain, light scornful Spirit,</hi> because his first book he called, <hi>the Quakers Rounds,</hi> and he would excuse himself from my charge, &amp; saies, <hi>that it was a name according to the nature, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> My charge on him was true, for his title did savour of a scornful spirit, for the name <hi>Quakers,</hi> was given in scorn and derision, and he to that end do use it; and as for going rounds, of which he speaks, himself is the most guilty; as before <hi>I</hi> have shewed; in denying a thing and then confessing it.</p>
            <p>And whereas I charged, that his former <hi>was not a faithful account,</hi> though he called it so; &amp; I proved my charge which he is not able to remove, that it was an unequal and false account, by relating much more then himself spoke, and much less then I spoke; and this he confesses still, and that I am sure made it a false account and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true, and he clears not himself of it; though he say, <hi>Christ spoke many things at several times which are not particularly related; yet Lukes relation, and Iohns relation was true, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Riply.</hi> Their relation was true, in that wherein they took in hand to relate, they did relate truly; but he hath t<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp;c. to which I refer the Reader, to understand more of <hi>P. T.</hi> his folly; and the manifestation of truth.</p>
            <p>And wheeras he again charged the <hi>Quakers,</hi> with <hi>a Spirit</hi> of <hi>jeering, and scorns and jeers are not a fruit of the Spirit, saith he, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> He here again charges falsly; for we know that Scorning and jeers after the flesh are not works of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> nor fruits of it; but that we have denyed and its cast out; neither do we scorn, or jeer any, saving as in <hi>Isa.</hi> 37.22. Then he no less then confesses his wrong dealing, who in his last, changed <hi>R. G.</hi> word, from <hi>called, to owned</hi>; which word is of much consequence in that place; but would cover <hi>R. G.</hi> by saying, that <hi>R. G.</hi> did <hi>not undertake to prove the Scriptures considered as meer writings; but the thing contained in the Scriptures, to be the word of God, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reply.</hi> Here <hi>P. T.</hi> hath endeavoured to mend the matter, by his conception and meaning, given to <hi>R. G.</hi> words; now the words of <hi>R. Goodgroom</hi> was, he said, <hi>he would prove the letter, the word</hi>; and upon that brought his Argument; and is not the letter meer writings, and nothing else; but when they see they cannot make good their own words, then they turn of, the strength of reproof, by, they meant so, or they meant so, and no man ever yet could, or can prove in all the Scriptures, that the letter (the writings) are called the word; but as I still confessed, that which is written of, is the word, and the writings are the words that declares of the word, which was in the beginning; but <hi>P. T.</hi> would fain reconcile this difference between us; say they, <hi>the writings, the letter are the word; say I, that which is written of, is the word,</hi> now betwixt these are great difference, as spiritual men may judge; as much as between a dead Trumpet, and a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing breath sounded through it; nay, its hard to reconcile that which is contrary in nature, they must leave preaching for money, and cease to take Tythes and gifts for preaching, before I can be at unity, and another birth must speak and live in them, and that which now lives in them must be slain, and their Crown laid down, before reconciled I can be to them or they to me, though I have no envy against persons, more then the Saints had with them that opposed the truth, nor no weapon shall I use against them; saving that that is Spiritual, and the sword that goes out

               </gap>. 23. doth neither say nor signifie, that the letter (the writings) are the word; or so called, though <hi>Moses, Deut.</hi> 5.5. said, he would shew them the word of the Lord; did he then shew them the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the writings, the Scripture; I say no, therefore he did not call the writings and the letter, the word of God as you affirmed, and seeks now to prove; but thou perverts Scripture, and proves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to purpose, and though many times the word of the Lord came to such a Prophet, and such a Prophet, as thou hast proved, in <hi>Hosea, Ioel,</hi> and others; yet did the writings, and the letter come to them; or that which the letter and writings declares of; let wise men judge, that nor all thou canst say, doth prove that the writings, the letter, is the word of God, or that ever any of the holy men of God called them so; so that till better proof be given which I never expect; I need not revoke any thing that I have said contrary, <hi>viz. that the letter and writings are the word, or by the holy men of God so called,</hi> but still I say the writings, and letter are not the word; but the thing written of, is the word of God, that lives for ever. Then in that I charged <hi>R. Goodgroom</hi> with saying, <hi>when I had my Bible in my hand at the dispute, I had the thing signified in my hand, said he</hi>; which thing <hi>P. T.</hi> in his first relation had much falcified, but now he seems to acknowledg the thing, and excuses it, by supposing it was a slip of his tongue, the highest matter of offence in it; as for the words, not only my self but divers others do well remember them spoken by <hi>R. G.</hi> thy fellow disputant, and had he or you then confessed a slip of the tongue, it had gone no further, but in that thou in thy first relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, gave a wrong account thereof, and had laid down the thing quite otherwise then he spoke it, this made the matter more a transgression, and thy account to be false; neither am I ready to catch words from the mouth of my apponent, as thou charges me, but that charge is justified against me and the truth, I must needs make use of it, to shew the folly of such men, that will so do, even out of their own mouths often, and by their own words, to confound them, and would thou have me to give away a just cause through n<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

the Scriptures, for it saith, a man shall be justified by his words, and by his words shall he be condemned.</p>
            <p>And as for my answers to his queries, raised from some words of mine written in a book, called, <hi>the Standard, &amp;c.</hi> my answer saist thou, is little else then asserting the same thing over again, &amp;c. now I say its needless here, to transcribe the Queries and answers over again, but let them be looked in my first booke Iled, <hi>something of truth made manifest, &amp;c</hi> where it may be seen that my answers are sufficient, and laid down to the satisfaction of all reasonable men that desires to be resolved; though thou say, there is as little evidence of truth <hi>in the last, as in the first</hi>; but doth not at all discover the falsness of them in any particular, which had been right for thee to have done, and not to have charged evil in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral upon my answers, and prove nothing; but who will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him except such as takes his words for an oracle, for them that have received the good undestanding cannot believe him.</p>
            <p>Then in the conclusion, he charges me with harsh kind of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soriousness; because I said, <hi>what can be in the heart of such a man that can draw so bad consequence from such upright words</hi>; when in his former he had concluded, that I held forth giddy doctrine, and weakned the authority of Scriptures to beget undervaluing thoughts of them, and such like, because I had affirmed the truth, in saying, the divel and <hi>Pharoah</hi> spoke something thats written in Scripture, and had I not reason to question what is in his heart, who had the boldness, without fear to conclude so evil against me as he did, not proving the contrary to what I said; and in that I did charge darkness and blindness upon him, so I do and may still till he repent, for doth he not accuse me falsly in many things, as in saying my principles are too light, &amp;c. but proves not particularly his charge; and in his first book accused us, as if we had <hi>a Pope in our bellies,</hi> which words are both lies, and scornful; and are not these things true signs that he is in <hi>darkness and blindness</hi>; and so my charge is not false upon him.</p>
            <p>Then he saith he <hi>will not judge E. B. hastily,</hi> &amp;c. Answer, hath not thou falsly judged me already in many things, as I have shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, yea and the Lord in time may let thee see, thy judgment is false, and awaken thy conscience to repentance; and then shalt thou confess I have done thee no wrong, but the wrong dealing lyes at thy door; so that by what is said, the title of thy book is a lie and utterly false; which is, <hi>some principles of Edw Burroughs, called a Quaker, examined and sound too light.</hi>
