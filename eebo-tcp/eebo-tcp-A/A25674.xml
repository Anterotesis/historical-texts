            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE,</head>
            <p>S<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CH is the Nature of a Sermon, as that the Principles and Tenents of a Religion, are no way better diſcovered than by it: It being the Expoſition of what is to be believed and practiſed, in order to Eternal Salvation. And what the Preachers do generally moſt inſiſt upon, that generally is chiefly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed to be believed, or practiſed in the Church. Now in moſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Sermons, it is obſerved, that their chief buſineſs is railing againſt the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Popery;</hi> then that may be preſum'd, the chief Tenent of the Proteſtant Church: With ſuch Proteſtant Doctrine, this Doctor hath filled his Sermon, from the beginning to the ending, falſly aſperſing the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Church, with the Notions of <hi>Slavery</hi> and <hi>Bondage;</hi> no better arguments than <hi>Cora</hi> uſed againſt <hi>Moyſes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Numb. <hi>16.</hi> V. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> flattering the people with a falſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, which produceth nothing but Confuſion and Diſtraction. Not conſidering that this his Doctrine, is contrary to the practiſe of his own Church: For he doth not only make every ignorant Man or Woman, a competent judge of <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> but prefers their judgment before their Paſtors, whilſt their Church obligeth every one to ſubmit to her decrees. I find in this <hi>Doctor's Sermon,</hi> many falſe and uncharitable Reflections upon <hi>Roman Catholicks;</hi> Concluſions drawn from falſe Suppoſitions, things unworthy of a Scholar: And which is unworthy of a Preacher; not one Word of Exhortation to Piety, until he comes to the <hi>21</hi> page, where he ſpeaks thus, <hi>It concerns us mightily, for the Honour and Support of our Religion, to be at a better Union amongſt our ſelves,</hi> Inſinuating to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the neceſſary effects of this Doctrine, which are Diviſion and Diſtraction. All the reſt of his Sermon is, <hi>Bearing falſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs againſt his Neighbour.</hi>

            <head>THE TITLE OF THE <hi>Doctors BOOK,</hi> The indiſpenſible neceſſity of the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the holy Scripture, in order to Mans Eternal Salvation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THis Propoſition in the ſenſe of the Doctor, is thus ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred plain. There is no Salvation to be had without the knowledge of the Scripture; which Propoſition is notoriouſly falſe. For at this preſent, many thouſand <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants,</hi> know not one line of it, unto whom I preſume the Doctor will not deny Salvation. <hi>2ly.</hi> There was no Scripture heard of, until the time of <hi>Moyſes,</hi> and were all Damned before his time? <hi>3dly.</hi> From the time of <hi>Moyſes</hi> till Printing was found, it is not probable, that every one of the Vulgar could have the <hi>Bible,</hi> and will the Doctor Condemn them all? If he doth not, then the knowledge of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was not neceſſary. If not neceſſary then, why is it now?</p>
            <p>The Doctor may ſay, the knowledge of the Scripture is neceſſary, not the reading of it, and ſo annuls my laſt inſtance.</p>
            <p>I anſwer, the Doctors whole drift is at Damning all thoſe that do not read it, from the beginning to the end of his Sermon; for if he were not for Damning thoſe who read not, his argument would be of no force againſt us; for the vulgar ſort of <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> may have as much knowledge of the Scripture as needful, without reading it. The Doctor is then for impoſing a neceſſity upon the vulgar, of knowing the Scripture by their own reading: But he doth not tell how much they muſt know of it, if all, I fear the Doctor hath Damned himſelf, if not all? How much muſt they know, under pain of Damnation, As much as the Doctor will aſſign the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſhall know without Book. I would willingly know of the Doctor,
<pb facs="tcp:62688:3"/>
why the people might not be ſaved, if they know it by the Mouth of their Paſtor, without reading? The Doctor ſeems to anſwer thus. <hi>The people might know it, but the Prieſts do interpret it falſly to them,</hi> but the Doctor, when he ſaid ſo, did not remember the Story of the Old Woman, <hi>who ſought her Daughter in the Oven.</hi>

            <epigraph>
               <q>
                  <p>Woe be to you, <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>THe <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> were Men, as the Doctor owns, who were teachers of the Law; and under pretence of interpreting the Scriptures, had perverted them, and kept the true knowledge of them from the people.</p>
            <p>I put this queſtion to the Doctor, Whether if thoſe <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> had faithfully interpreted the Scriptures to the people, and yet had not put the <hi>Bible</hi> into the hands of every Milk-Maid to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pret, whether Chriſt had denounced that <hi>Woe to them</hi>? The Doctor muſt prove the affirmative, before he can reflect upon the <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will put down the practice of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> the <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and <hi>Roman Catholicks,</hi> as to this point. The Doctor ſays in his ſecond Page, that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> were teachers of the Law, and under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of interpreting the Scriptures, did pervert them, and keep the knowledge of them from the people.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Miniſters are reformers of the Law, and do interpret the Scriptures to the people, and give the people the liberty to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret them by the private ſpirit, in oppoſition to their Paſtors, if they think fit, which hath brought ſuch a fertility of Faiths into this Nation, that there are as many as Reformers, and as many Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers almoſt as Men.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Catholick Prieſts</hi> do confine the Scripture to the reading only of the prudent Laity, and doth not think every Cobler a competent Judge of the ſenſe of it, nor able to guide himſelf in matters of Faith and Practice; but the Paſtors by the <hi>Bible,</hi> are to guide him, and to read and expound the Scriptures to him.</p>
            <p>Which of theſe three doth the Impartial Judge think is the beſt in all reſpects? in the 3<hi>d.</hi> Page the Doctor ſpeaks of knowledge and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. What he ſays of Knowledge, is right Canting. What of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, is a falſe Impoſition. I never underſtood Ignorance, a vertue in <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Divinity; If the Doctor had read the Manual of our Laity, he might have found it there, in the expoſition of the Ten Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments a ſin. Now, if the Doctor thinks as he ſpeaks, we muſt
<pb facs="tcp:62688:4"/>
be all lovers of Ignorance, not only the Laity, but the <hi>Prieſts</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. I humbly offer to the Doctor my ſelf, for an Experiment of his Proteſtant ſpeculation, to be examined (if he knows how) in all or any part of Divinity. For if he pleaſes I will bring him Tradſmen, who ſhall readily anſwer him with an Objection, whatſoever he ſhall be pleaſed to ask.</p>
            <p>In the 4th. Page, the Doctor ſaith, the Scripture alone can inſtruct us in the Will of God perfectly. I ask the Doctor, Whether it be the Will of God that we ſhould keep <hi>Sunday</hi> for <hi>Saturday,</hi> and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſten Infants? If it be, where doth the Scripture inſtruct us ſo perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as that every Milk-Maid can ſee it there? But let the Doctor leave Canting, and give a ſolid reaſon if he can, why the Church which declared Authoritatively the Scripture to be the Word of God, hath not Authority enough and Knowledge, to inſtruct us in the Will of God, if there were no Scripture.</p>
            <p>The Doctor proceeds in the ſame Page, and ſays, the Teachers of the Jewiſh Church, did not proceed ſo far as to deprive Men of the uſe of the Holy Scripture; in the 2d. Page he cannot avoid a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction. For he ſays that the Jewiſh Teachers did take away the Key of Knowledge from the people, which the Doctor inſinuates was the Scripture. Then they took away the Scripture, and did not. But ſuppoſe they did not take away the Scripture; yet, the Doctor ſays, they took away the Key of Knowledge; then a Man may have the Scripture, and yet not have the Key of Knowledge; then the <hi>Jews</hi> might have the Scripture, and yet not ſee Chriſt in it, as in fact did not. So may the Vulgar have the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and yet not ſee the they <hi>New Law</hi> in it. So may a <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Cobler have the <hi>Bible,</hi> and yet want the <hi>Key of Knowledge</hi>; and to whom ſhall he go to for it? What if he ſhould go to the <hi>Pope</hi>? For the Doctor owns in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, the <hi>Pope</hi> had the <hi>Key,</hi> and indeed I cannot tell how the Doctor ſhould come by it, unleſs he ſtole it: Or perhaps it was found in the Ruins of the <hi>Monaſteries</hi> here, in the beginning of the reformation which were broke down, (the Doctor may ſay) to ſeek for this <hi>Key,</hi> and it was found there all ruſty (as the Doctor ſays) and they have been rubbing it ever ſince. But to come to my purpoſe. How is it, that the Scriptures alone, can perfectly inſtruct us in the Will of God, as this Doctor ſays, when a whole multitude may have them, and yet not ſee the Will of God in them; as the <hi>Jews</hi> had the Scripture, and yet ſaw not the Will of God in it? Now, why may not the Doctors of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> put the Scripture into the Hands of all the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and yet teach them falſe Doctrine from their Pulpits and keep the true ſenſe and meaning of the Scripture from the people, as well as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi>? then the people may have the <hi>Bible,</hi> and yet not know the Will of God. Then is the Paſtor more neceſſary for the people than the <hi>Bible.</hi> We ſee the <hi>Quakers, Anabaptiſts, Presbyterians, Sweet-Singers, Lutherans, Church of England, &amp;c.</hi> all theſe differ in Faith; and that they are not all of the right Faith. I ſuppoſe the Doctor will
<pb facs="tcp:62688:4"/>
own all theſe have the <hi>Bible.</hi> How come it that they do not teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themſelves by it? The Doctor muſt anſwer, that the Teachers of theſe Men do give the people the <hi>Bible,</hi> but keep from them the <hi>Key of Knowledge,</hi> as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> did: And if any one ſhould accuſe the Doctor of acting like a <hi>Scribe</hi> and <hi>Pharisee</hi> in this Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon; how will he vindicate himſelf? I will undertake to prove him guilty of above 40 falſe Reflections, and above-right lies againſt his Neighbours in this one Sermon, which is more than he can prove upon either <hi>Scribe</hi> or <hi>Phariſee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Towards the end of this Page, the Doctor ſays it is a horrible im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety, to interpret the Scripture in a wrong ſenſe to the people (God forgive the Doctor for it) the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> do own it a Crime: But he ſays: it is more horrible not to permit the people to read it. He thinks this muſt be taken upon his bare Word, for he brings not one thing like a proof for it.</p>
            <p>In the 5th. Page, the Doctor doth intermix Prayers in an unknown Tongue, with the not reading the Scripture, and ſays that the people for theſe two Errors are ſure to periſh, and ſurely damned, and that the Scripture is neceſſary to ſave them, and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in theſe two points, doth contrive the Eternal Ruin and Deſtruction of the peoples Souls. For theſe uncharitable and extravagant expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Doctor brings not any thing like a Proof: This I will prove upon the Doctor, according to his own Tenent, that whatſoever <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant</hi> reads not the Scripture, is ſurely Damned. And whatſoever Paſtor of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church, doth not take ſuch care of all, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of his Flock: Firſt, That he be inſtructed to read. 2<hi>dly.</hi> That he have the <hi>Bible.</hi> 3<hi>dly.</hi> That he read it. This Paſtor for neglecting his Flock, in a thing ſo neceſſary to Salvation, muſt be ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Damned alſo. This muſt follow, if the Scripture be neceſſary to Salvation: And if the <hi>Proteſtant Religion</hi> had ſtarted up before Print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was found out, how many poor <hi>Proteſtants</hi> would this Doctor have Damned then?</p>
            <p>I ask'd the Doctor why a vigilant Paſtor cannot inſtruct his Flock in all things conducing to Salvation, without giving them the <hi>Bible</hi>?

            <p>The Reader may be perhaps, deſirous to know the truth of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholick</hi> practice in theſe two points: As to the firſt, to wit, The reading the Scripture, the Church doth not debar the Laity from it. She alloweth it to every one, whom the Paſtors judge will uſe it, with reſpect and ſubmiſſion to the Church, through the Motive of Piety, not Curioſity. Where the Scripture may be ill uſed there it is not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuffered to be read. And what ſlavery is in this? The Vulgar of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, do believe that they are to be fed by their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors, neither to feed themſelves, nor to be fed by <hi>Bibles.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt appointed Paſtors, leſt his people ſhould ſtray into Errors.</hi>

               </note>
               <pb facs="tcp:62688:5"/>
The Doctor appoints the <hi>Bible.</hi> The <hi>Roman</hi> Church appoints the <hi>Bible</hi> for the Paſtor chiefly, and the Paſtor for the people. The Doctor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>points the <hi>Bible</hi> for the people, and the Paſtors are uſeleſs. If an <hi>Indian</hi> ſhould come into <hi>England,</hi> which would ſooneſt make him of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Church, the Doctor or the <hi>Bible</hi>? If the Doctor, then is the <hi>Bible</hi> not neceſſary to Salvation. If the Bible, how comes it that ſo many Millions of well inventioned people in the World, could never ſee the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> there, who notwithſtanding were no ſtrangers to the Bible. This I admire in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who ſince the reformation, are much more ſolicitous to get Eſtates and keep them, than thoſe things which belong to the next World (and for this I appeal to their Conſciences) that every one ſhould not claim a right, to be Judge of the Laws of the Land to preſerve their Eſtates, as well as to be Judge of the Scripture, in order to preſerve the Soul.</p>
            <p>In the next place, the Doctor brings Scripture for his Tenent If any one ſhall think any Text he brings to be like a proof; if I may be worthy to know it, I will readily anſwer it.</p>
            <p>Then he brings Fathers. If the Doctor will be ſo kind as to let me know out of what part of their Writings he took his Quotations, I will readily anſwer him.</p>
            <p>Then follows his Bold Challenge to his Adverſaries to bring him any Father, who diſcourages the Vulgar from reading the Scripture. I anſwer his Challenge, producing theſe following.</p>

            <p>St. <hi>Gregory</hi> ſaith, the Word of God abhors carnal and rude Men, and that the Law is partly manifeſt and partly hidden.</p>
            <p>To the Weak Faithful, we ought to open thoſe things which are more perfect; and when they are become proficients, and have clear ſight, then to put the light before them.</p>
            <p>The reaſons why Hereſies are, is the obſcurity of the Divine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The unlearned ought not to preſume to read the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, before they have deſpiſed and caſt off the pomp of the World.</p>
            <p>I conclude with St. <hi>Hierome.</hi> When there is no one Art, that any of Vulgar can ſay they know, yet this (the knowledge of the Scriptures) every old prating Woman, every old doting Fellow, every talking So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſter pretends to know. They tear the Scripture, and teach it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they have learnd it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62688:5"/>I could have given farther teſtimony out of the Fathers, if it had been needful; but theſe will ſuffice, to vindicate the <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Practice, in contradiction to the Doctor, who ſo boldly affirmed, that we had not one rag of Antiquity to cover our Nakedneſs in this point. I aſſure the Doctor, that ſome would have been glad of ſuch Rags, to have made the Church of <hi>Englands</hi> Wedding Garments.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman Catholick</hi> Practice in the ſecond point, which the Doctor calls Prayers in an unknown Tongue, is thus. <hi>The chief part of the</hi> Roman Liturgie <hi>is the</hi> Maſs; the ſubſtance of which is an Action, to wit, <hi>An Offering to God, of the Body and Blood of his Son, under the form of Bread and Wine, by the Hands of the Prieſt: A Sacrifice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorative and applicative of the great Sacrifice of the Croſs.</hi> The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor dares not deny us Antiquity and Univerſality, as to the truth of this Doctrine. The reſt of the <hi>Roman Liturgie</hi> is ſubſervient to this. That part of the <hi>Liturgie,</hi> which the Vulgar do frequent, is the <hi>Maſs,</hi> as <hi>Morning Prayer; Even-ſong, Compline,</hi> and <hi>Litanies,</hi> as <hi>Evening Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> The reſt of the <hi>Liturgie</hi> is ſaid by <hi>Church-Men,</hi> at Mid-night, or at three, four, or five of the Clock in the Morning, or at ſuch hours as the Vulgar is ſeldom preſent, and perhaps the Doctor would not leave his warm Bed and Wife to hear it, although he pretends to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>Latin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now that part of the <hi>Liturgie</hi> which the Vulgar do frequent, they do underſtand as well, as the Vulgar in the Proteſtant Church do their <hi>Common-Prayer</hi>; for the <hi>Maſs,</hi> I told the Doctor, it was an Action, and Seeing is their moſt proper ſenſe for it, and the Vulgar may have as good Eyes as the Doctor. As to that part which is properly Prayer, it is Tranſlated into the Vulgar Tongue, and they have it in their <hi>Prayer-Books,</hi> and being obliged to Church-Service every <hi>Sunday</hi> and Holy day, they underſtand it as well as their daily Prayers. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles and Goſpels of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> are likewiſe in the Vulgar Tongue, with the meaning of every Circumſtance. And as to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of every word of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> which the Doctor was pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon. I anſwer, that the greateſt part of the Words of the <hi>Maſs,</hi> are the Prieſt's ſecret Prayers to God, for himſelf and the people: There is moreover, daily Preaching and Catechiſing in the Church, by which there is enough given to the weakeſt Capacitie, to let him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, what he ought to believe and do, in order to Salvation.</p>
            <p>To the Queſtion. Muſt the Vulgar be acquainted with every thing which is done in, and belongs to the Church, before they can or will be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed &amp; edified, or no? If they muſt, then the Church of <hi>England</hi> Edifieth not the greateſt part of her Children in her Cathedrals, where, when they ſing Muſically, few underſtand them, neither are the Vulgar ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb facs="tcp:62688:6"/>
and edified in the Proteſtant Ceremonies, neither am I edified, that the Doctor ſhould ſo much extoll Knowledge, when not one in ten thouſand ever read the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Profeſſion of Faith: Nor one in the like Number, knows how much he is obliged to believe. So that when we rightly examine things we ſhall find ignorance a Proteſtant Vertue. And is it not to ſtumble at a Straw and leap over a Block, to Damn the people if they read not the Scripture; but let the Tenents of thoſe who read it, be ever ſo perverſe, ſo they proteſt againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, they are Members of Criſt's Church (as the Biſhop of <hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells</hi> called the <hi>French Hugonots</hi> in his Paſtoral-Letter) and go to Heaven. And is not this Phariſaical in the Doctor, to Damn people for not reading the Scripture, a Proteſtant Tradition, and not Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them for their Schiſmatical and Heretical Opinions, things Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by God, his Son, his Apoſtles, and his Church in all Ages?</p>
            <p>I argue farther, thus. It is not neceſſary that the Vulgar under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand explicitly all, and every thing that is believed in the Church, as ſuch decrees of the four firſt General Councils as are <hi>de Fide,</hi> or the Thirty Nine Articles in the Proteſtant Church deſtinctly. If the Doctor denys this Propoſition, he muſt Condemn moſt of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Laity of his Church; ſo by parity of Reaſon, a Man may be a true Worſhiper, and yet not underſtand diſtinctly and <hi>verbatim</hi> every Word which is ſpoken in the Church.</p>
            <p>Farther, the Doctor cannot ſhew any Divine precept or decree of any General Council, which contradicts the practice of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, in this point; which he ſhould have done, if he had ſpoken Doctor like before he had pronounced Damnation upon the people. Now, where there is no precept contradicted, the Church is to be obeyed.</p>
            <p>Theſe reaſons I give the Doctor, for the <hi>Latin</hi> Church <hi>Liturgy</hi> being every where in <hi>Latin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> That the Governours of the Church may have a certain know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true practice of it, which they could not conveniently have, if it were in every petty Speech.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> To avoid danger of the nullity of the Sacraments, which would happen if the Prieſt ſhould not pronounce the Words rightly, of which there is danger, when the Prieſt is not perfect in the Language.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> It is convenient for many of the Clergy and Laity. To the Clergy, becauſe they are often ſent from one country to another, of different Speeches, for the common good, who if the <hi>Liturgie</hi> were in the Vulgar Tongue, they for many years could not be able to aſſiſt at
<pb facs="tcp:62688:6"/>
any Solemnity of the Church. The ſame Reaſon is proportiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lly for the Laity.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> For Uniformity.</p>
            <p n="5">5<hi>thly.</hi> Becauſe the <hi>Latin</hi> is not mutable as other Speeches are.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Becauſe it hath been ſo from the Beginning, as theſe following Fathers do Witneſs.</p>
            <p>St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> inſinuates that in his time,<note place="margin">In expoſ. Orat. Dom.</note> the publick <hi>Liturgie</hi> was in <hi>Latin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> inſinuates the ſame to have been in his time.<note place="margin">De Doct. Chriſt. c. <hi>13.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>St. <hi>Hierome</hi> affirms,<note place="margin">Praefa in para lip.</note> that all the Eaſtern Church uſed the <hi>Greek</hi> Language. There are many more Reaſons to be given; ſome the Doctor gave, ſuch as he thought he could eaſily refute. The laſt Argument which the Doctor brought, fell indeed to the Ground for want of a Friend to ſupport it. The other three Reaſons which the Doctor ſays, the <hi>Catholicks</hi> pretend for themſelves, I ſuppoſe the Doctor had from the <hi>Iriſh Popiſh Collier,</hi> a Man who had more Devotion than Learning.</p>
            <p>But what if the Church gave no Reaſon, and ſhould ſay, <hi>Stat pro ratione voluntas.</hi> It is my Will, and you are to Obey: I am impower'd by God, and aſſiſted by his Spirit; you are to ſubmit, <hi>captivantes intellectum</hi>? This Method would not pleaſe my Doctor at all. Arbitrary Power! <hi>Egyptian</hi> Slavery! He would raiſe up Old <hi>Cora,</hi> with all his Arguments that were uſed againſt <hi>Moyſes</hi>; and <hi>Cora</hi> would come in with a Why and a Wherefore, againſt every thing that pleaſed not his Humour. But muſt a King give a Reaſon to every Subject, why he makes ſuch or ſuch a Decree? If not a King, why the Church?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Liturgie</hi> which the Church uſed in <hi>England</hi> (the Doctor will not deny) was in <hi>Latin,</hi> from St. <hi>Auſtin's</hi> time, till the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, and were all Damned in thoſe Nine Hundred Years! Perhaps the Doctor will anſwer with his Book of <hi>Homilies,</hi> that all the World, Men, Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, were Drounded in Idolatry and Superſtition. Uncharitable Doctor! The World will neither believe your <hi>Homilies,</hi> nor you, without ſome proof, at leaſt a ſeeming one, like your caracteriſed ſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62688:7"/>But let us conſider what were the Works of theſe <hi>Egyptian</hi> Slaves (as the Doctor is pleaſed to call the <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi>) whilſt they were in Slavery, under their hard Task-Maſters. Some abandoning the World, retired into Monaſteries, dedicating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves intirely to God by ſolemn Vows, paſſing their whole Life in Prayer, Faſting, Contemplation; Day and Night, praiſing God. Others building and endowing Religious Houſes, Hoſpitals, Alms-Houſes, Cathedrals, Collegiate, and Pariſh Churches. And from whence have you all your Fat Benefices, but from theſe <hi>Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian</hi> Slaves? If theſe Men were Idolaters, then are you with your Wives and Children, like thoſe Heatheniſh Prieſts in <hi>Daniel, Who devoured thoſe Meats which were offered to Idols.</hi> If theſe Men were Workers of Piety, then may you juſtly fear to be called to an account by the great Task-Maſter, for not fulfilling the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of your <hi>Egyptian</hi> Benefactors.</p>
            <p>But we will now paſs from the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Slavery and Darkneſs, to the Liberty and light of the Reformation. I fear to aſſert any thing poſitively, leſt I ſhould Err; for I cannot find in this Proteſtant Land of Promiſe, any <hi>terra firma,</hi> upon which I can build any Poſition. I will therefore, ask the Doctor, who, perhaps, may be better acquainted with the Principles of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation than I am. Firſt,</p>
            <p>Whether God by any Miracle, or any thing like a Miracle, gave teſtimony of the Truth of the Reformation? If God did not, how will the Doctor convince me that this is not <hi>ignis fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuus,</hi> a falſe Light, and a real <hi>Egyptian</hi> Darkneſs.</p>
            <p>The Doctor may perhaps anſwer, that he needeth no Miracles, it ſufficeth that their Reformation is conformable to Scripture; but is not this, Doctor, the plea of every <hi>Heretick,</hi> and cannot they ſee as well as you? You are then to juſtifie all Hereſies, or to bring a plea for your ſelves, ſuch as they cannot uſe for their juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe the Doctor will allow every Reformer the ſame Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which he takes himſelf, and then I ask him if he can ſhew me a Heretick in the World, and by what Rule he declares him an Heretick?</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> Are all the Reformations of Chriſt's Church true? If not all, how many? Had there been any right and true Reformation of God's Church, if the Church of <hi>England</hi> had not reformed? And did the better Livers of the Engliſh people begin and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
<pb facs="tcp:62688:7"/>
the reformation of <hi>England?</hi> Do the reformed live better than the Old <hi>Egyptian</hi> Slaves? How many Holy Days and Faſting Days have they added to that <hi>Egyptian</hi> Calendar.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> What Benefit hath the World found by the reformation? If it be a deliverance from <hi>Egyptian</hi> Darkneſs, how uncharitable are you to <hi>hide this Light under a Buſhel</hi>? (and it is ſo little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that a Buſhel may eaſily hide it.) Why do you not let it ſhine to the World? Why do you not ſend your Miſſioners to unſlave and enlighten the World, with the knowledge of your true new Goſpel? Why do you not oppoſe the Romiſh Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in all Kingdoms of the World? Strange, that all the true Miniſters of the Goſpel, ſhould be ſo much wedded to Benefices and Wives, that none ſhould have the Spirit of <hi>Paul, The charity of God urgeth me</hi> to diffuſe the truth of the Goſpel, over the Face of the Univerſe. And now how many Countries have they Converted? How many Kings have obeyed the Church of <hi>England</hi>? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Mores have ye Chriſtened, and inſtructed in the <hi>Indies</hi>? When doth the Doctor think that there will be of all Tribes and People, Tongues and Nations of his belief? There muſt certainly be more A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical endeavours uſed, than have been hitherto. For in truth, I never found any <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Miſſioners beſides the Penal Laws, the Charity of the Reformation. to free Papiſts from Tyranny, Sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, and Darkneſs, and bring them into the Light and Liberty of the Reformation. Liberty to believe what ye pleaſe, ſo ye believe not the <hi>Pope</hi>: Liberty to do what ye pleaſe, ſo ye do not pleaſe the <hi>Pope,</hi> Liberty to excuſe all Errors, provided ye blame <hi>Popery.</hi> I find in the Writings of many of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Men, that they are ready to excuſe the Pagans to ſuppreſs <hi>Popery,</hi> to Embrace all <hi>Hereticks,</hi> to ſtrengthen their party, and prove their univerſality. He is the worſt of Men, who ſeems any way to favour the <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I met the other day, with a little <hi>Proteſtant Champion,</hi> (a Three-penny Book) who briskly contended for the Validity of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Church of <hi>England.</hi> He own'd indeed, that they had them by Succeſſion from the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; but in my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if they had not found fallen Prieſts from the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they would have gone to <hi>Monſieur Calvin,</hi> both for Articles and Orders, and have then thought their Church altogether as good as it is now: But to return to my <hi>Little Champion</hi>; he had no ſooner proved the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Ordination valid, and that by a Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Biſhops in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, till the beginning of the Reformation, but preſently reflects upon <hi>Popery</hi> with a proteſtant Eye, and crys out, I will retort my argument upon the Papiſts, and prove their Ordination invalid, and did prove that for many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before the Reformation, they had no valid Ordination; and ſo annulled his own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62688:8"/>Thus Acts my Doctor, he cares not what he Preaches to the people, provided it be againſt Popery; he cares not what they Learn, ſo they Learn not Popery, or Learn to Hate it. He cares not how many Lies he tells in his Pulpit, ſo he can but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie Popery.

They inſtruct the people ſparingly and ſlightly. Their Sermons are made up with Stories. They leave out the Second Commandment. The <hi>Roman</hi> Church yields Antiquity to the Proteſtants. They decline all manner of Tryal. The <hi>Roman</hi> Prieſts take the Childrens Bread from them.

            </p>
            <p>Theſe and many other uncharitable falſe aſperſions, the Doctor in one Sermon, did preſume to caſt upon the <hi>Catholicks,</hi> at the very time when his Prince and the Head of his Church, did openly profeſs that Religion. Surely he was inſtructed by <hi>Luther's</hi> familiar An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel: And I find indeed, much of <hi>Luther's</hi> Spirit in the Doctor, and a great deal of <hi>Luther's</hi> Angel's Truth.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:62688:8"/>I admire with what Face the Doctor can thus belie God's Church, eſpecially at ſuch a time, when all thoſe injuries muſt reflect ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily upon the Head of his own Church, our King, as that he is an Idolater, that his Worſhip is ſuperſtitious, that he is igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant: That he ſhall be Damned; That he is in <hi>Egyptian Darkneſs,</hi> and the like.</p>
            <p>I have here briefly run over the Doctor's Book. To reflect upon every particular Cant, was not my Buſineſs. I was only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to anſwer the principal Heads, which are, the not reading the Scriptures and Prayers in an unknown Tongue. If any one ſhall think there is any material point not anſwered, I will endeavour to ſatisfie him or them, if I may be worthy to know it; in the interim, I leave what is written to the impartial Reader, and return to conclude with my Doctor, giving him this Admonition and Exhortation. <hi>Dura cervice &amp; incircumſciſis cordibus &amp; auribus, vos ſemper ſpiritui ſancto reſiſtitis</hi>: That is, the Doctor ſhould not ſtuff up his Sermon with Canting Reflections upon his Neighbours, much leſs with down right Lies: that he ſhould be cautious how any thing he preaches, might reflect upon the ſacred perſon of his King. That he ſhould take care no Argument might be retorted upon himſelf, for then he fouls his own Neſt. I exhort him to teach his people ſound Doctrine, and good Morality; for that is the way to keep the people in Union (which is all he exhorts them to in his Sermon) and if they be not in Union, it will bring them to it, and at length to the knowledge of the Truth, which I wiſh the Doctor with his Flock.</p>
