         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE addreſs of this
ſhort diſcourſe to your
Lordſhip, hath a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
encouragement;
the greatneſs of the Cauſe in which
it engageth, and the confidence it
hath of your Honours Patronage;
I mean not, my Lord, ſo much
<pb facs="tcp:57184:3"/>
from any intereſt of the Writer,
as of the Cauſe; which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no leſs than the Rights and
Priviledges of one of the learnedſt
Societies in the world. I know
your Lordſhip too well, to think
the ſcale of Juſtice (when in your
hand) capable of being weighed
down by favour or affection, be the
occaſion of it never ſo moving;
nor indeed doth our Cauſe want
it: yet if ſtrictneſs of Integrity
could be any wayes bowed in your
Lordſhip, it would be in regard
to Learning and the ſupport of a
noble and ingenuous Art, againſt
the barbarous attempts of rude
and illiterate Impoſtors. The
Colledge of Phyſicians have long
<pb facs="tcp:57184:3"/>
ſince received particular marks
of your Lordſhips favour; which
they owe to the great intimacy
your Lordſhip hath had with
Nature her ſelf; and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent
value you muſt needs put
upon all ſuch, whoſe Induſtry
and parts have recommended them
to her familiarity: Whether the
Colledge deſerve that character
no man better underſtandeth than
your Lordſhip, to whom few or
none of their writings or other
tranſactions are probably unknown.
And it is their happineſs in this
juncture of affairs, where ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
machinations and contrivances
are made againſt them, that the
two Chief Juſtices of this Land
<pb facs="tcp:57184:4"/>
are Men ſo abundantly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed

neceſſary to the true Stating of

fit to be made the Oracles of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy,
as well as Law; and to
give a true eſtimate of the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence

            <head>READER,</head>
            <p>THE Treatiſe againſt which I write,
is ſo mean in it ſelf, that the very
anſwering of it, needeth an Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy;
for no wiſe man is in danger of being
taken with ſo ſcurrilous a Pamphlet, or
can think the intereſt of the Colledge fit to
be put in the ſcale with it; But the greateſt
part of the world is not wiſe, and Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
is ſo abſtruſe, as to be above the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and judgment of the Vulgar, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
liable to the miſrepreſentation of Knaves;
who with ſmall colour of reaſon and great
clamour, can breed in the common people
what eſteem of it they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>I have therefore thought it neceſſary to
undeceive the ordinary Readers of that
Pamphlet, by giving them as plain an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
as I could of the State of the
<pb facs="tcp:57184:6"/>
Queſtion; which ſince it is of a mixt
nature, partly relating to the Legality of
the Colledges Juriſdiction, and partly to
the uſefulneſs or hurtfulneſs of that power,
I have been forced to adventure upon the
exerciſe of more Faculties than One, and
to meddle in matters of Law as well as
Phyſick.</p>
            <p>If I have in the former tranſgreſſed the
limits of my Profeſſion. I have but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
my Adverſary, who did it before
me; Not, that I expect not, a far better
and ſounder defence to be made at the Bar,
when the Cauſe is pleaded by men learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the Law; But becauſe ſomething
was neceſſary to be ſaid to the People, whoſe
prejudice againſt the Colledge, as it is eaſily
raiſed by ſo weak an accuſation as that of my
Adverſaries; ſo it will, I doubt not, as
eaſily be taken away, by a plain Narrative
of thoſe Laws and Statutes by which the
Colledge is firmly eſtabliſhed and governed,
and of which their leiſure or education
would not permit them otherwiſe to take
notice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:57184:6"/>
The later part was more within my
Sphere, and therefore more freely handled; yet
that alſo required ſuch plainneſs and conciſeneſs,
as was requiſite to inform the Reader without
tiring of him; But as ſhort as it is, I hope
it is ſufficient to make all men underſtand
the real advantages of a regular inſtitution of
Methodical practice, and the danger of Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirical
adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p>Reader, I will detain thee no longer, but
remit thee to the Book it ſelf. Farewel, and

            <p>ALthough it hath not yet been my
happineſs to be a Member of the
Learned Society of Phyſicians in
<hi>London,</hi> yet I profeſs my ſelf an honourer
of them, and cannot without indignation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
men of ſo great worth and abilities in
their Faculty, ſo barbarouſly aſſaulted by a
wretched combination of ignorant and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent
Empiricks, who being united into a
confederacy and fortified by a common ſtock,
dare now attack the Law as well as the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
and purchaſe from hirelings fit for
ſuch turns the ſuggeſtion of whatever tricks
and mean arts are deviſable to elude either
the proceedings of Courts, or the Statutes
themſelves, which the prudence of our
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:57184:8"/>
Law-givers have provided in this caſe. By
this means that ſecurity, which was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
intended for the lives and healths of the
Inhabitants of this Nation is endangered,
and one of the nobleſt Profeſſions in the
world expoſed to the contempt of the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar;
who not being competent Judges of
the juſtice or merits of any cauſe, much
leſs of one of ſo high an importance, are
notwithſtanding moſt forward in their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures;
and whilſt they are entertained with
the ridicule of the ſubject, by degrees do
ſuffer themſelves to be cheated into a falſe
opinion.</p>
            <p>It is therefore high time to undeceive
them, and by detecting the legerdemain of
theſe Juglers to take away the venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and reverence which ignorance other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
produceth in ſuch mean capacities
towards men, whom but to underſtand
is ſufficient to render contemptible. I have
for this purpoſe pitched upon a Pamphlet,
entituled, <hi>A Corner ſtone, &amp;c.</hi> which whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
written by the Club of Mountebanks,
by whom the pretended Author is ſaid to
be maintain'd in his Law-ſuit, or whether
the fruit of one mans labour, I know not;
but I find it containeth the ſubſtance of
what all of them have hitherto ſaid againſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:57184:8"/>
the Colledge. An Anſwer therefore to this,
may ſave us the trouble of writing any
more upon this Subject; nor need that An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
be prolix, if we conſider all their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
are reducible to theſe three follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Queſtions.</p>
            <p>1. Whether the Colledge of Phyſicians
be eſtabliſhed by Act of Parliament?</p>
            <p>2. Whether the proceedings of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
againſt Empiricks and unlicenced
perſons be oppreſſive?</p>
            <p>3. Whether Phyſicians educated in Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,
and particularly the Colledge of
Phyſicians in <hi>London,</hi> have been the great
hinderers of the Art of Phyſick, and more
eſpecially that of Chymiſtry?</p>

               <p>FOr the clearing of the firſt you muſt

and Parliament taking into ſerious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
the great injury that was done to his
Liege people by a great multitude of ignorant
perſons, as, Smiths, Weavers, Women,</hi> &amp;c.
<hi>who boldly took upon them to practiſe the noble
Science of Phyſick to the high diſpleaſure of
God, great infamy of the Faculty, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
of many of his Subjects,</hi> as the Act
more at large expreſſeth: it was therefore
by the Authority of that Parliament en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted,
<hi>That no perſon ſhould practiſe Phyſick,
except he were firſt examined, approved and
admitted by the Biſhop of</hi> London <hi>or Dean of</hi>
Pauls, <hi>calling to him or them <hi>four Doctors of
Phyſick,</hi> &amp;c.</hi> This Act continued in force till
the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the ſame Kings Reign,
at which time a Charter that had been
granted in the 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of the ſame by the
interceſſion of Cardinal <hi>Woolſey</hi> and ſix
eminent Phyſicians, three of which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed
to the King's own perſon (wherein
a perpetual Colledge of Phyſicians was
erected and granted in <hi>London,</hi> and within
ſeven miles of the ſame, with ſeveral privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
therein ſpecified) was confirmed by
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:57184:9"/>
Act of Parliament; in which Act <hi>it was
ordained,</hi> eſtabliſhed and enacted, That the
ſaid Corporation of the ſaid Commonalty and
Fellowſhip of the Faculty of Phyſick aforeſaid,
<hi>and all and every Grant and Article and
other thing contained and ſpecified in

               <p>
                  <hi>Now if you pleaſe to compare this</hi> Act
<hi>with the</hi> Colledge Charter, <hi>which is part of the

that the ſole power of Licenſing Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
doth belong to the Colledge, that it
plainly tells you in the following words;</hi>
Conceſſimus Praeſidenti &amp; Collegio ſeu Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitati

that <hi>none</hi> ſhall practiſe Phyſick in <hi>London</hi> or

or their Succeſſors, and obtain their Licence
ſigned with their common Seal, in pain of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feiting
for every month five pounds. <hi>Now
let any judicious perſon compare theſe two
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:57184:10"/>
paſſages with the Statute made in</hi> 3 H. 8.
<hi>before-mentioned, and I doubt not but
he may be fully ſatisfied that the power
which was granted to the Biſhops by that
Statute was now inveſted in the Colledge
by the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the ſame Kings
Reign: for 'tis evident that the word</hi> Nemo
<hi>in the Patent is a general Negative, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
all from practiſing, but ſuch as have
procur'd the Colledge Licence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But notwithſtanding this plain evidence
Mr.</hi> Adrian Huyberts <hi>deſires leave to produce
certain</hi> circumſtances <hi>(as he terms them)</hi>
whereby it may appear queſtionable whether
ever any ſuch Law as that in the <hi>14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                  </hi> and
<hi>15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                  </hi> of <hi>H.</hi> 8. was paſſed in due form; <hi>the
reaſon he urgeth being this;</hi> that it
doth not appear by any Record that the Royal
Aſſent was given to it, there being neither
at top nor bottom of it to be ſeen <hi>Le Roy le
veult,</hi> the only Signature whereby any thing
is known to be a Law.</p>
               <p>To this I reply, that I very much que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
whether ever Mr. <hi>H.</hi> took the pains
to ſearch the Records of the Tower; if he
did not, as I have ſome reaſon inclining me
to believe; I muſt crave leave to tell him
and that by more weighty circumſtances
than he hath produc'd to the contrary, that
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:57184:11"/>
the <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> of his unanſwerable Author
will paſs for an Oracle with none but the
Empiricks, for doubtleſs no rational man
can imagine</p>
               <p>1. That a Prince ſo ſenſible of the great
miſchief redounding to the Nation by this
Mechanical Tribe, and of the great felicity
which might be obtained for the publick
by eſtabliſhing a Colledge of grave and
learned Phyſicians, who ſhould admit none
to the practice of that noble Science with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their approbation; ſhould grant a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to them by the ſpecial requeſt of perſons
ſo often employed about his Royal Perſon,
and ſo much intereſted in Him; and yet
ſhould take no care of confirming this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
by Act of Parliament, when as our
Adverſaries confeſs it was offer'd to Him.</p>
               <p>2. 'Tis as difficult to imagine that the
ſame Colledge of Phyſicians in the ſame
Kings Reign, and that but 17. years after,
ſhould have ſeveral other priviledges gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them by Act of Parliament (as their not
keeping watch or ward, bearing offices,
<hi>&amp;c.)</hi> and that by the name of <hi>the Preſident of
the Corporation of the Commonalty and Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
of the Science and Faculty of Phyſick in the
City of</hi> London, <hi>and the Commons of the Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
of the ſame, &amp;c.</hi> if they had not had their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:57184:11"/>
Charter confirm'd by the foremention'd Act.</p>
               <p>3. 'Tis yet a greater difficulty to imagine
that a Parliament holden in the firſt of
Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> which was not above 28. or
30. years after the Collegiate Statute was
made, ſhould paſs another Act in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this, only on a preſumptive evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that there had been ſuch a One made,
when reallyit never had been ſo <hi>in rerum na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turâ;</hi>
and that this they did, is very evident;
which making much to our purpoſe, and
likewiſe to the abrogating of the Act made
in 3 <hi>H.</hi> 8. I ſhall take the pains of tranſcribing.</p>
               <p>Whereas in the Parliament holden at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
on the <hi>15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                  </hi> day of <hi>April,</hi> in the <hi>14<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                  </hi> year
of the Reign of our late Soveraign King <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi>
the <hi>VIII<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                  </hi> and from thence adjourned to
<hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the laſt day of <hi>July</hi> in the <hi>15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
                  </hi>
year of the Reign of the ſame King, and there
holden, <hi>It was enacted,</hi> That a certain grant
by Letters Patents of incorporation made and
granted by our ſaid late King, to the Phyſicians
of <hi>London,</hi> and all Clauſes and Articles contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the ſame Grant ſhould be approved, granted,
ratified and confirmed by the ſame Parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>For the conſideration whereof</hi> be it Enacted
by the Authority of this preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
That the ſaid Statute or Act of
Parliament, with every Article and
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:57184:12"/>
Clauſe therein contained, ſhall from
henceforth ſtand and continue ſtill in
full ſtrength, force and effect, any Act,
Statute, Law, Cuſtom, or any other
thing made, had, or uſed to the contrary
in any wiſe notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p>4. 'Tis certain that this Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
hath been owned as ſuch by all the
grave Judges and Lawyers of this Land
upon every Trial betwixt the Colledge
and the Empiricks. And though in Dr. <hi>Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi>
Caſe the Colledge was overthrown,
yet it was not for that the Judges queſtion'd
the legality of the Act of the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>
of <hi>H.</hi> 8. for the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Cook,</hi>
Juſtice <hi>Warburton</hi> and Juſtice <hi>Daniel</hi> of the
Common Pleas Bench, were ſo far from
doubting the Authority of that Act, that
they plainly tell us in that very Caſe, that <hi>the
Cenſors had their Authority by Letters
Patents &amp; Act of Parliament, which are
high matters of Record:</hi> and in the 4<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of
King <hi>James</hi> there was a recovery upon this
Statute againſt one <hi>Gardener;</hi> and in the
7<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, there was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
recovery in the Common Pleas
againſt one <hi>Butler;</hi> and in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the
ſame Kings Reign a Writ of Error was
brought in the King-Bench, and there Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:57184:12"/>
affirmed, both Courts owning the
Statute of the 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>H.</hi> 8. where
the Colledg Charter was confirmed; and
in 1651. there was another recovery in the
Common Pleas upon the ſame Statute
againſt <hi>Trigge.</hi> And though Mr. <hi>H.</hi> tell
us of one ſingle Judge that would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
of the Colledge Patent as eſtabliſhed
by Act of Parliament in the time of the
late Uſurper (who could ſcarcely have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
for a Society of men eſtabliſhed by
Regal power, of whom ſeveral had expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
ſo great Loyalty to their Soveraign) yet
very prudently he omits his reaſons, leſt
we ſhould obſerve ſo much of partiality if
not bribery in him, that it might juſtly be
ſuſpected that Intereſt not Judgment obliged
him to ſuch an Opinion: but allow Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
what he deſires from this inſtance, doth
he ſeriouſly think that this is as authentick
as the Judgment of all the Judges of the
Kings Bench and Common Pleas, (which
I juſt now intimated) and the High Court
of Parliament in the Firſt of Queen <hi>Mary?</hi>
I am apt to believe he cannot; however if
he doth, I am ſure he will ſcarcely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
any other into ſuch an opinion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
it be thoſe of his own Aſſociation, who
would gladly have it ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:57184:13"/>
But to give the Gentleman all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
he can deſire to his <hi>circumſtantial
Argument, that there is not to be ſeen on the
top or bottom of this Roll the Kings Royal
Aſſent,</hi> I make a queſtion whether this will
carry his Cauſe; becauſe the Kings Signa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is ſometimes endors'd on the back ſide
of the Roll; and if he did really put him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to the trouble of ſearching, I wiſh he
would have informed us whether he found
this <hi>Roy le veult</hi> endors'd upon every ſingle
Roll of the other 13. Statutes made in the
ſame Seſſion; for 'tis a little odd to conceive
that one poor ſingle Statute in the ſame Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
where 14 were paſſed, and that not the
firſt or laſt, but the 5. in order, ſhould be ſolely
queſtion'd; eſpecially ſeeing Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> in
the preamble before thoſe Statutes aſſures
us that the King by the aſſent of the Lords
Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons
aſſembled, had ordained, made and enacted
certain Statutes and Ordinances in manner
and form following, of which number this
is One.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s ſecond circumſtance to prove
that the Collegiate Patent was never eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
by Act of Parliament, is this; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he ſaith, <hi>that it doth militate againſt
the Spirit of an</hi> Engliſh <hi>Parliament, the great
Sanctuary of publick freedom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:57184:13"/>
To this I need return no other Anſwer,
but only deſire Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to read over the
foremention'd Statutes of 14 and 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8.
and 1 <hi>Mar.</hi> and then tell me whether
the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> did not
judge without any breach of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi>
that learned and experienc'd men were the
fitteſt to paſs a judgment of thoſe brought up
in their own profeſſion: and doubtleſs had
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> underſtood the nature of humane
Societies, and the neceſſity of Laws for
their government, he would not have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed
his weakneſs and ignorance ſo much
as he hath done in this Argument.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In the ſame page he tells us,</hi> that it might
be an eaſie matter to impoſe upon a Printer a
Copy of a Bill inſtead of a Statute, eſpecially
about matters of Phyſick, whoſe concerns in
thoſe dayes were but in few hands; and the
Profeſſors very inconſiderable perſons; and
that after it had been once printed for a Law,
how eaſie was it for the Lawyers unawares to
accept it, and Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> to reprint it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
further enquiry?</p>
               <p>To theſe ſurmiſes, I anſwer, that Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
would have done well to have told us the
men that durſt impoſe upon a Printer a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
of a Bill inſtead of a Statute; or given
us an inſtance of a Printer that was ever
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:57184:14"/>
ſo audacious or adventurous to do it; if he
cannot, 'tis ſtrange that he ſhould trouble
the world with ſuch idle and wild ſuppoſals,
that never had any better foundation than
in an ill-contriv'd fiction; which doubtleſs
can never obtain greater credit with
any judicious man, ſeeing that all Bills
which paſs both Houſes of Parliament are
fairly engroſſed and offer'd to the King to
Sign, which being done, Copies of thoſe
Bills are taken out by the Clerk of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,
who diligently and faithfully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amines
them with the Printer by the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Records; and then are the Copies of
them committed to the Preſs. Now by this
conjecture of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> both the Clerk of the
Parliament and the Printer, or one at leaſt
of them, muſt needs be <hi>impos'd upon</hi> (as he
terms it) But how improbable this is, let
any one conſider ſeeing the apparent danger
that muſt needs enſue; it being the cuſtom
of Parliament to print all their Acts after
every Seſſion, that ſo all the ſubjects might
underſtand their duty and the rule they
have to ſteer their actions by; and no doubt
but there were ſome Judges in that Seſſion
in the Houſe of Lords, and Lawyers in the
Houſe of Commons, who had the Copies
of thoſe Acts when printed by them, and
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:57184:14"/>
would ſoon have taken notice of an affront
of ſo high a nature as this, put upon
the King and both Houſes of Parliament:
and though I muſt confeſs that a Printer
may commit an <hi>Erratum</hi> in the printing of
an Act, which occaſions the Judges many
times to ſearch the Records of the <hi>Tower,</hi>
as being their only authentick evidence to
decide a diſputable caſe; yet ſurely no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident
can ever be produc'd of a Bill that
was printed for an Act, and own'd for ſuch
by a Parliament in the ſame Kings Reign,
and confirmed by another about 28. years
after, and allowed as ſuch in ſeveral Trials
by the Judges of both Benches; when in
truth it was but a cheat impos'd upon them;
eſpecially ſeeing it was an Act of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which was both publick and penal,
and might probably have trials upon it the
Term after it was paſſed, there being at
that time ſo many Aggreſſors thereof.</p>
               <p>And as for what Mr. <hi>H.</hi> tells us as to the
ſtate of Phyſick in thoſe dayes, <hi>that it was
but in few hands, and thoſe inconſiderable
perſons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis manifeſtly falſe; for 'tis evident
that there was then a great number of the
predeceſſors of Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s ſociety ſwarming
in the Nation, which occaſioned that Act
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:57184:15"/>
to be made in 3 <hi>H.</hi> 8. as the preamble
tells you; but then we will grant him that
they were perſons as inconſiderable as
the Coblers, Weavers and Trumpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of our own dayes, that practiſe phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
to as good purpoſe as the old Women,
Smiths, and other Mechanicks then did;
who as that Act ſpecifieth, had no inſight into
phyſick nor into any other kind of learning,
ſome of them being ſo ignorant as they
could not read. (a fair deſcription of great
part of the Empiricks of our time) But if
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> intended by this expreſſion thoſe that
were the true Profeſſors of phyſick in that
age, they were far from inconſiderable
perſons, as witneſs Doctor <hi>Linacre, Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre,
de Victoria, Halſewell, Frances, Yaxeley,
&amp;c.</hi> the firſt of which is particularly
mention'd in the Chronicle of that Kings
Reign amongſt the great men of note of
that time.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And as for what he ſaith of Mr.</hi> Pultons
reprinting this Statute without further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,</p>
               <p>'Tis ſuch a rude and uncharitable reflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
upon ſo induſtrious and worthy a perſon,
that 'tis neceſſary to acquaint the world
with what account that excellent Author
hath given of his great faithfulneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:57184:15"/>
in this undertaking; his words are
theſe; <hi>with as great care and induſtry as I
could uſe, ſo many of the old Statutes hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
printed in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue and which
are the foundation of proceedings both legal and
judicial, have been by me truly and ſincerely
examin'd by the original Records thereof; and
the reſidue with the Regiſter of Writs being the
moſt ancient book of the Law; the old and
new <hi>Natura Brevium,</hi> the books of Entries,
the books of Years and Terms in the Law; the
beſt approved and printed books, and by all ſuch
other circumſtances as might beſt give probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of truth to the learned.</hi> Now certainly
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> if Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi> was willing to take
ſuch vaſt pains to examine the old Statutes
by the Records of the <hi>Tower,</hi> and the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of books he here mentions, that full
ſatisfaction might be given to all inquiſitive
men; he would not <hi>without further inquiry
print a Bill for a Statute,</hi> eſpecially ſeeing
that he might with much more eaſe ſatisfie
himſelf and others of the truth of this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute,
than of thoſe old Satutes he mentions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And though Mr.</hi> H. <hi>tells us that</hi> after
this Bill <hi>(as he calls it)</hi> had been once printed
for a Statute, it was an eaſie matter for the
Lawyers unawares to accept it;</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:57184:16"/>
To this I anſwer, that if it were <hi>ſo eaſie
for the Lawyers unawares to accept of a Bill
for a Statute;</hi> yet methinks the Parliaments
of <hi>England</hi> ſhould not ſo readily accept it;
nor yet the grave Judges and Serjeants of
the Law, whoſe proper ſtudy and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is to ſearch the Records of the <hi>Tower</hi>
and Statutes of Parliament; I confeſs I am
therefore ſo charitable to think that he could
not entertain ſuch diſhonourable thoughts
of thoſe ſo grave and judicious of that Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty;
but muſt rather intend by that ſaucy
expreſſion the younger and leſs experienc'd
Wits of the Law; but then one would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,
that they ſhould not have been ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py
in their diſcoveries for near 150 years, as
the Caſtle-Cole Philoſophers of our age
pretend to be; and truly of all the diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
they have made, ſince they obtain'd
<hi>Certificates of their abilities to practiſe phyſick,</hi>
and have converted that noble Art into a
contemptible trade, this may bear away the
Bell; it being indeed their true <hi>Corner-ſtone,</hi>
for erecting a new Colledge of Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banks
and petty-Chapmen: but when all
is done, I am apt to believe that this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
and the reſt of his ſociety will find the
Lawyers more wary men than they are
aware of; and truly it behoves them to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57184:16"/>
be ſo, when they are to deal with men of
ſuch reaching heads, beyond all of their own
faculty, and have made greater diſcoveries
in the Lawyers profeſſion, than any of
them can pretend to, though they could
have ſtudied the Law from the 15 of <hi>H.</hi> 8.
to the 27 of <hi>C.</hi> 2.</p>
               <p>The third circumſtance that gives Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
cauſe to believe the forementioned Act to
be no Statute, is this; <hi>that in</hi> 3 H. 8. <hi>there
was a Statute that lodged the power of licenſing
perſons in the hands of the Biſhop of</hi> London,
<hi>or Dean of</hi> Pauls; which as he ſaith, <hi>p.</hi> 13.
<hi>was never repealed by any ſucceeding Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this I need return little other anſwer,
but only deſire M. <hi>H.</hi> to peruſe the abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that Statute, in 14 &amp; 15 <hi>H.</hi> 8. com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
with the latter part of the Letters Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent,
granted by King <hi>Henry</hi> in the 10 of
his Reign; and the Firſt of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> 9.
with thoſe four circumſtances mention'd
<hi>p.</hi> 8—10 to which give me leave to add a
fifth, it being very pertinent to our preſent
purpoſe; and that is, the Statute made in
32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. where the Chirurgeons of <hi>London</hi>
were likewiſe made <hi>a Body Corporate, and had
the ſearch, overſight, puniſhment and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of offences committed againſt Barbery
and Surgery.</hi> Now let this Statute be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57184:17"/>
with that made in 3 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and you
will find that all Chirurgeons as well as
Phyſicians were exempted by one and the
ſame Statute from exerciſing their Art,
except they were firſt <hi>examined, approved
and admitted by the Biſhop of</hi> London <hi>or Dean
of</hi> Pauls, <hi>upon pain of forfeiting five pounds
for every moneth.</hi> Now is it probable that
the King and Parliament ſhould abrogate
the latter part of this Act for the Chirurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Barbers in <hi>London,</hi> and that as far
as I can obſerve unrequeſted; and yet the
former part of that very ſame Act ſhould
ſtill remain in force againſt the Phyſicians;
when the reaſon of both was but one and
the ſame? which you may read in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
of that Act, as follows, <hi>for aſmuch as
the Science and cunning of Phyſick and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
is dayly within this Realm exerciſed by a
great multitude of ignorant perſons, therefore it
was enacted that no Phyſician or Chirurgeon
ſhould practiſe Phyſick or Chirurgery without the
Biſhops Licence, &amp;c.</hi> Now I wiſh that Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
would give us ſome inſtances of Chirurgeons
(ſince this Charter of theirs) that have
taken Licences of the Biſhop, or Dean of
<hi>Pauls,</hi> refuſing obedience to their own Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration,
and pleading the Act of 3 <hi>H.</hi> 8.
which they may as juſtifiably and legally
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57184:17"/>
do, as any that practiſe Phyſick by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
Licences, and refuſe ſubmiſſion to Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate
eſtabliſhments; but I am apt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
he cannot, and then I will leave it to
the judgment of any ſober man whether
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath not more rudely treated the
Faculty of Phyſick than any other profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;
allowing Chirurgeons and Barbers
a greater priviledge, than he would Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians;
although a man would have thought
that his having been bred an Apothecary,
ſhould have taught him better manners to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
his Maſters; but alas! poor man,
he hath been ſo long vers'd in the Quacking
profeſſion, that as far as I can learn by the
character he hath given of himſelf, 'tis a
Chronical diſtemper; ſo that doubtleſs had he
conſulted the Lawyers about juſtifying his
practice againſt the Colledge, they would
rather have adviſed him to plead preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for his doing ſo, than the abrogated Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
of 3 <hi>H.</hi> 8. I wiſh therefore that the
good man would be ſo kind to himſelf as ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly
to read over the Statutes I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
and conſider of the circumſtances I
have propos'd againſt his, to prove that the
Collegiate Charter is eſtabliſhed by Act of
Parliament; and then I doubt not but he
will leave diſcourſing ſo impertinently and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57184:18"/>
like an Apothecary; if not, I know not
what can better help him out of this dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
malady of his, than a doſe of his
own <hi>Coeleſtial Liquor,</hi> which (as he ſaith)
<hi>is ſuited to all palates and conſtitutions.</hi> But
to proceed and give the Gentleman all the
ſcope I can, let me tell him, that in his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
Statute, though the power of licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Phyſicians in <hi>London</hi> was inveſted in
the Biſhops hands; yet that of examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was lodg'd in the Phyſicians, elſe 'tis
difficult to give a ſatisfactory reaſon why
<hi>the Biſhop or Dean</hi> are obliged <hi>to call to him
or them four Doctors of Phyſick,</hi> unleſs it
were upon the forementioned account;
which having been (I conceive) ſeldom
or never obſerved of late, 'tis a queſtion to
me, whether any of the Licences given
without this material clauſe be current in
Law, if this beloved Act of his were now
in full force and power; ſeeing 'tis plain
that in Doctor <hi>Bonham</hi>'s Caſe the Juſtices of
the Common Pleas gave it againſt the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
for their not purſuing their power
given them by the Statute. And then 'tis
probable that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and moſt of his Tribe
might find it a greater trouble to obtain
their Licences, than yet they have done;
and would then as little approve of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57184:18"/>
as they do of the Phyſicians Statute;
for 'tis not that they reſpect one more than
the other (they being as truly State-Fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
as any can be term'd Eccleſiaſtick
ones) but that they hope their Certificates
may paſs for examination, a teſt they more
hate than Phyſicians themſelves. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be, I am ſure it is ſcarce worth
Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s ſo zealous contending for this Act,
ſeeing that in all points it ſuits not with
his apprehenſion, that <hi>Certificates of the
integrity of mens lives, and good ſucceſs in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
are the ſureſt evidence of a mans learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and knowledge proper for his Faculty;</hi>
the Act well fore-ſeeing that the greateſt
number of Smiths, old Women, and Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
might readily procure thoſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nials
of their ability to practiſe; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
as the preamble of that Act tells us,
that <hi>foraſmuch as to the Science of Phyſick
there is required both great learning and ripe
experience;</hi> it hath made proviſion of a
much better teſt of mens abilities in that
profeſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> Such as have been edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
in the ſame Faculty, and by their
great learning and experience have arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

mention'd to prove the Collegiate Statute
not confirmed by Act of Parliament,
abounds with ſuch manifeſt contradictions
that it needeth not any other confutation, but
barely its reading over, which the Reader

                     <head>As to the reſt of their Statutes</head>

I will acquaint them with one of their own

conclude, for their moral converſation to

in reference to their ſick and languiſhing
Patients; with their method of compoſing
all differences that may ariſe amongſt them
(much excelling that of Pope <hi>Adrian</hi>'s infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible

But notwithſtanding all this clear evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
of the equity of their Statutes and
juſtice of their proceedings, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth
them as oppreſſive and perſecuting;
which foul charge (one would have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected)
ſhould have been attended with
plain and evident demonſtration; which
occaſion'd me to take the pains very ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
and attentively to view and review
his Pamphlet; but all was to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
<hi>parturiunt montes, naſcetur ridiculus
mus;</hi> for at the long run I could only find
a few lines beſtowed upon the Reader to
acquaint him with a ſuit at Law commenc'd
againſt him by the Colledge of Phyſicians;
Now whether this was Oppreſſion on the
Colledges part, or ſtubbornneſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fractorineſs
on Mr. <hi>H.</hi> I will leave it to the
judgment of all indifferent perſons, who
underſtand the nature of Oppreſſion; which
I take to be, as it hath relation to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
controverſie, an unlawful ſeizing upon
the poſſeſſions of others, owning and avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the doing ſo; and this by pretending a
claim to them; corrupting juſtice by bribes
and gifts, or elſe over-ruling it by Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
But how little the Colledge can be
charg'd with this ſo heinous a crime, and
how much Mr. <hi>H.</hi> with refractorineſs, will
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:57184:27"/>
be very evident to any perſon, that pleaſeth
to peruſe the former part of this book,
where he may find that the power which
they exerciſe towards Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and the reſt
of his companions, is eſtabliſhed in them by
Act of Parliament, and this not by one
ſingle Act but by three ſucceſſively; in
which are declared the penalties that would
neceſſarily enſue upon the violation of them,
which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſo little regards that he tells
you that <hi>he will be in the ſeent of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
and his houſe ſhall be open to receive
Patients, and furniſh them with Medicines;</hi>
and as if this was not ſufficient to diſcover
his reſolved oppoſition to the Laws of the
Kingdom, and Statutes of the Colledge,
he breaks out into opprobrious and vilify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
terms, calling them <hi>tipling Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees,
book Doctors, maſters of the ſtage, &amp;c.</hi>
and chargeth them for <hi>managing their
Art under a great myſtery of iniquity:</hi>
which myſtery I have faithfully acquainted
the world with in this Chapter, where
their moſt juſt, excellent and equitable
Government is faithfully repreſented to the
view and judgment of all impartial Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
and though theſe men do ſo often
Cant upon their monopolizing of Phyſick,
'tis ſo far from truth, that they frankly
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57184:27"/>
offer to receive all to the practice of that
Art, who upon examination appear to be
ſober and learned; and if their accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

or promote the welfare of
mankind, although but in <hi>ſome cures</hi> (as
is expreſſed in their Statutes relating to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiates)
they do readily admit them to

prove that this worthy Society is ſo tender
of the lives and health of the Kings ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
that they would diſcourage none
from doing them ſervice, who by a fair ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination

                     <head>To this I anſwer,</head>
                     <p>1. That ſucceſs in practice is a more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain
evidence of a mans learning and
knowledge in our Faculty than examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
unleſs this ſucceſs appear by ſufficient
circumſtance to be the effect of judgment
and knowledge; and if ſo, why ſhould any
perſon accompliſhed with thoſe abilities
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57184:28"/>
refuſe to give a ſatisfactory account of his
proficiency in the Medical Science, to thoſe
learned Phyſicians that are by Law deputed
for that purpoſe? And ſurely leſs reaſon we
have of queſtioning the ſucceſs of that mans
endeavours, who preſcribes nothing to his
Patients but what is conſonant to the rules
of reaſon and Art, than an Empirick's that
obſerves neither; though life and health be
not thereby obtain'd, which is not to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to the ignorance or miſtake of the
Phyſician, but to divine providence inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
therein; whilſt the fortuitous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
of Medicines (though attended
with ſucceſs) is no wayes to be allowed,
nor the perſon to be better eſteem'd, that
directed them; and that, becauſe they
preſcribed thoſe remedies without under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the nature of the diſeaſe, or the
proper time of their exhibition; which
though advantageous to ſome, may prove
ruinous to others, as I have fully ſatisfied
the world in the latter part of this Book re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating
to the <hi>methodus medendi;</hi> and though
ſometimes we will allow that Patients
hereby have recover'd, yet ſeeing it hath
been by accident and not by Art, we might
probably have ſeen the ſame, if the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
had ſolely committed themſelves to

Natures <hi>regimen,</hi> which is uſually attended
with far greater ſucceſs than their high ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded
Chymical preparations; eſpecially
if managed by the diligent attendance and
judicious obſervation (which were the
great <hi>Arcana</hi> of divine <hi>Hippocrates)</hi> of a
prudent Phyſician, who is as cautious of
diſcompoſing or tumultuating the bloud
with Cordials and Elixirs, as of weakning
and impoveriſhing it with too cooling and
refrigerating Julips, and therefore rather
waits her motions, remembring that golden
rule, <hi>cunctando res agitur.</hi>

of a mans learning and knowledge pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
for his Faculty, <hi>as Mr.</hi> H. <hi>aſſerts</hi> pag. 9.
<hi>how comes it to paſs that</hi> the event of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
is ever an unequal Judicature, <hi>as he
tells us out of my Lord</hi> Bacon <hi>the very page
after? who farther ſaith, as he quotes him,</hi>
that who can tell, if a Patient die or recover,
whether it be by accident or by Art? <hi>now
pray Mr.</hi> H. <hi>what becomes of your Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates

                     </p>
                     <p>But to proceed to that part of Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion,
<hi>viz.</hi> the conjecturalneſs of our Art,
from whence he would perſwade us that
Phyſicians are <hi>no competent Judges, becauſe
their Art is conjectural, having no certain
rules to judge by.</hi>

                     <head>To this I Anſwer,</head>
                     <p>1. If the Art of Phyſick be Conjectural,
why may not Phyſicians be as good, if not
better Conjecturers in their own Art, than
any other ſort of men? eſpecially ſeeing
they ſo well underſtand both the Theore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
and Practick part thereof; for ſurely
he that is the beſt Conjecturer, is the beſt
able to judge what conjectures are moſt
rational, and founded upon the faireſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>babilities.</p>
                     <p>2. If there can be no Judges in Phyſick,
how comes it to paſs that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſo fiercely
contends for the Reverend Biſhops being ſo
fit for that employment? ſeeing that accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to his own aſſertion, <hi>they have no certain
rules to judge by.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>3. I would gladly know of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> how
Phyſicians in former Ages were ſo fit for
that employment, but in ours muſt by no
means be allowed; the reaſon he gives is
this, becauſe <hi>the Art was then fixed and ſtaked
down to certain points, maxims or rules,</hi> &amp;c.
but how if I ſhould tell him that from his
own principles it may fairly be deduced
that the ſame maxims and rules are ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining?
for if his notion be true, that
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57184:30"/>
                        <hi>the Colledge hath made no improvement
in Phyſick, and are only to be eſteem'd the
Sectators of</hi> Ariſtotle <hi>and</hi> Galen; no doubt
but they retain the ſame maxims they there
eſpouſed; although let me tell him (for his
better information) that there are ſeveral
diſcoveries in the Phyſiological part of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
ſo clearly demonſtrated in our dayes,
by thoſe great and renowned Phyſicians
he ſo much contemns, that we muſt deny
even credit to our ſenſes, if we will not
give in our ſuffrage to the certainty of
them; which have been ſo far from ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring
our Art more conjectural, that they
have obtain'd the univerſal conſent of all
the ingenious of our Faculty; witneſs the
Circulation of the blood, its ſanguification
by the vital ſpirits and not by the Liver
(as the Ancients and all later Phyſicians
believed, till the incomparable Doctor
<hi>Gliſſon</hi> diſcharg'd it of that office) the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Chyle through the lacteal veſſels,
diſcover'd by <hi>Aſellius;</hi> its diſcharging itſelf
into the common receptacle, and from that
through the <hi>ductus Chyliferus</hi> &amp; valves of
the ſubclavian veins into the maſs of blood,
happily found out by the induſtrious <hi>Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quet;</hi>
the Lymphaticks by Dr. <hi>Jolive,</hi> the
<hi>Ductus ſalivales</hi> and <hi>lachrymales</hi> by our
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:57184:30"/>
learned countrey-man Doctor <hi>Wharton,</hi> and
that excellent Anatomiſt <hi>Steno,</hi> and many
others which I ſhall ere long have occaſion
to mention; which doctrines had they been
diſcover'd in the dayes of thoſe <hi>Greeks</hi> and
<hi>Arabians</hi> he talks of, would have been ſo
far from everting all maxims in Phyſick,
that I rather think they would have been
engraven in letters of Gold, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
have had Statues erected to their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.</p>
                     <p>And truly if we well look into the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of phyſick, we ſhall not find it ſo
Conjectural an Art as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> pretends; for
Medicine ſtrictly ſo called is very little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural
as to the rules of it, though as to
the particular application of thoſe rules to
the <hi>hîc &amp; nunc</hi> of a ſingle patient it may be;
but that is no more than is in Divinity and
Law, and indeed in all the profeſſions of
the world. The errors of a mans life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
in the ill uſage of avowed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
principles, and miſapplying them to
particular inſtances. But ſtill as to the
Theory of our Art as far as it is ſtrictly Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical,
it will not be found (as I juſt now
mention'd) ſo Conjectural as our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
pretend; for as to the ſubject Phyſick
treats of, 'tis certain and well known to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:57184:31"/>
every one of the Faculty; and the end and
deſign of the ſame is no leſs agreed upon on
all hands; and for the general deſcription and
Diagnoſticks of diſeaſes, who ever yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
about them? it being univerſally
agreed that there are ſuch diſtempers, as
Apoplexies, Epilepſies, Pleuriſies, Gout,
Stone, Feavers, Quartane Agues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which are ſo ſpecifically differenc'd by their
deſcriptions and diagnoſticks, that not only
Phyſicians but Nurſes are able to know
them. And for the Pharmaceutick part of
Phyſick, ſo far as it relates to the uſe of ſuch
remedies, which by experience have been
found of great benefit in ſeveral diſeaſes
of humane bodies, who hath not readily
embraced it?</p>
                     <p>I might likewiſe inform Mr. <hi>H.</hi> that we
are generally agreed as to the Cauſes of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
ſo far as they relate to air, diet, and
the reſt of the <hi>non-naturalia;</hi> ſo that 'tis
plain Phyſicians have had a ſtanding rule
to judge by theſe 2 or 3000 years, nor will
they want ſuch a rule to the worlds end.</p>
                     <p>But the matters of debate are of a more
remote conſideration, and not ſo truly Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical
as Philoſophical, I mean the Phyſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logical
principles which are borrowed out
of natural Philoſophy to the building up
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:57184:31"/>
of an Art which might in all parts be
complete.</p>
                     <p>And though our Adverſaries would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
that theſe principles are wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural,
yet poſſibly if they be attentively
conſidered, it may be found that our conteſts
as to theſe, are rather verbal than real;
differences about the <hi>focus</hi> or <hi>minera morbi,</hi>
or it may be about what hypotheſis ſuch a
humor may be beſt explicated by; whether
Galenical, Spagirical, or Sylvian.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall therefore endeavour to ſhew both
in Acute and Chronical diſeaſes how little
our Art may be eſteem'd conjectural from
ſuch debates as theſe. For inſtance, ſuppoſe
that the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> ſhall teach us that inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent
Fevers or Agues proceed from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementitious
choler, flegm, or melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
congeſted in ſome <hi>minera</hi> of the body,
and according as thoſe humors do ſooner
or later tend towards a ſtate of putrefaction
and commotion (whereby they are convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into the blood, and ferment therewith)
do cauſe thoſe febrile paroxyſms to return
ſooner or later.</p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Williſians</hi> ſhall tell us, that the
Eſſence of the one conſiſts in a more retor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
conſtitution of the maſs of blood, being
too much impregnated with Saline and
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:57184:32"/>
Sulphureous particles; the other in a more
acid and auſtere one, which being deprived
of its ſweet and balſamick nature, is apt
by reaſon of its penury of ſpirits and too
great exaltation of its terreſtrial and tarta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous
parts, (conſiſting of ſalt and earth)
to degenerate into a <hi>fluor,</hi> and induce a ſowr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
upon the whole maſs: the third in a
more debile conſtitution of blood than the
former, inſomuch that the greateſt part of
the nutritious juyce is perverted into a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative
matter, which occaſions the
Fits to return ſo much ſooner than in a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
or Quartane.</p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Sylvians</hi> as ſtrongly contend
that theſe Intermittents have their <hi>focus</hi> in
the <hi>Pancreas,</hi> and derive their original or
primary cauſe from the vitioſity of the pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creatick
juice, which at different periods
according to its various conſtitution doth
diſcharge its ſelf through its common <hi>ductus</hi>
into the inteſtines, and there fermenting
with an ill affected bile and phlegm doth
produce not only the various ſymptoms
that accompany theſe Agues, but the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<hi>ſpecies</hi> of them.</p>
                     <p>And thus in continued Fevers, the one
ſhall tell you that the putrefaction of the
humors in the Veins and Arteries is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
cauſe:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="51" facs="tcp:57184:32"/>
The other, too great an exaltation of the
Sulphureous parts of the blood, which imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
breaking forth into an efferveſcence,
procures that diſtemper we call a Fever.</p>
                     <p>The third ſhall tell you, that the <hi>ſaliva,
bile,</hi> and <hi>lympha</hi> being ill affected and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
circulating through the heart, do
there excite the foremention'd efferveſcency,
which occaſions this diſtemper.</p>
                     <p>And thus in moſt Chronical affections,
as Hypochondriack melancholy, Scurvey,
Gout, Rheumatiſms, Hyſterick affections,
Madneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The <hi>Sylvians</hi> ſhall tell you that theſe and
many others of the like nature do own their
original to a preternatural fermentation of
an acid juice or <hi>lympha</hi> with different ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects;
or from diverſity of acids fermenting
with one and the ſame ſubject, from whence
they would explicate all the <hi>phaenomena</hi> of
thoſe ſymptoms that are obſervable in the
foremention'd diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Williſians</hi> will no leſs probably aſſert,
that they proceed, from too great an exalta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Saline parts of the blood, which
are perverted in ſome of theſe diſtempers
into an acid and auſtere nature; in others,
into a ſowre and corroſive (ſo that the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
ſpirits, and nervous liquor are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:57184:33"/>
affected) and in others, into a ſtate of
fixed Alkalies, whereby the lixivial parts
of the blood being conveyed by the Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
into ſeveral parts of the body, and fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting
with the ſowre recrements of the
nervous juice, do produce ſome of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
diſtempers.</p>
                     <p>And the <hi>Galeniſts</hi> ſhall teach you, that
the cauſe of ſome of theſe is an <hi>atra bilis,</hi>
which is ſharp like Vinegar or <hi>Aqua fortis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now let any judicious perſon compare
theſe ſeveral Hypotheſes, and then tell me
whether there be ſuch a difference betwixt
them as our Adverſaries would pretend to;
for ſeeing they all agree as I before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
as to the deſcription, Diagnoſticks,
and procatarctick cauſes of theſe diſeaſes; to
which give me leave to add, Indications
for the cure of moſt diſtempers, which
though explicated by different Hypotheſes,
yet are ſo nearly related to one another, that
we may find them generally directing but
one and the ſame method of cure; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting
in the uſe of Medicines of the like
nature, which ſurely cannot render our
Art ſo Conjectural as Mr. <hi>H.</hi> would have it.</p>
                     <p>And as for thoſe internal cauſes of diſeaſes
I mention'd; which of the <hi>Galeniſts, Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi>
or <hi>Sylvians</hi> ever doubted the exiſtence
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:57184:33"/>
of thoſe acid humors, whereby they would
explicate the ſymptoms of ſeveral
Chronical affections, which are ſo far
from Conjectural, that there have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
undeniable demonſtrations to prove
the truth of them? One of which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
by the learned Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> in his
Treatiſe <hi>de morb. Convulſ.</hi> p. 116. who had
a patient, whoſe ſweat was ſo corroſive,
that like <hi>Aqua fortis</hi> it would <hi>cito exedere &amp;
corrumpere lintea;</hi> and in his excellent
Treatiſe <hi>de morbis Capitis</hi> he tells us, <hi>uſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
eſt nonnullos ſaepe laticem quaſi vitrioli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum
oeſophagi ac palati tunicas erodentem vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitu
excernere.</hi> And <hi>Skenkius</hi> in his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
as quoted by that great and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Philoſopher Mr. <hi>Boyl,</hi> gives us an account
of the corroſiveneſs of ſome juices, which
rejected by Urine or Vomit would boyl on
braſs, fret linnen, and ſtain ſilver.</p>
                     <p>And thus I might run through the whole
Catalogue of diſeaſes both Acute and Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical,
and ſatisfie all ingenious Naturaliſts,
how little prejudice our Art ſuffers by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
this freedom of Philoſophiſing; for
by Phyſicians comparing theſe ſeveral Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potheſes,
they may make choice of expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
the nature of diſeaſes by that Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis,
which they find moſt univerſally
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:57184:34"/>
ſatisfactory; although 'tis certain that our
Moderns have ill managed their talents in
Phyſick, if they have not (by enriching
our age with ſo many freſh diſcoveries)
made us Maſters of the reaſon of many of
thoſe rules which were gather'd from obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
only and practice by the Ancients,
eſpecially conſidering they have happily
found out ſeveral humors in the body which
our predeceſſors were unacquainted with;
as the Nervous and Lymphatick liquors, Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious
juices, and other great Anatomick
diſcoveries, whereby they might more ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely
and unerringly found their Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and more happily ſolve the <hi>phaenomena</hi>
of diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>And therefore I will not deny that this
Age having made ſo many improvements
of the rules that were given by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
may in ſome part vary the doctrine
concerning Indications and methods of
Cure, the greateſt part of which improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
I ſhall anon ſhew to be the effect
of Anatomical diſcoveries. But this doth
not at all invalidate my aſſertion nor change
the main body of practical Medicine, in
which the chiefeſt trials are made by Colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giate
examinations: that ſtill perſiſting as
much the ſame, as a houſe is the ſame that it
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:57184:34"/>
was a 100 years ago, though ſome ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Artiſt, by beating out ſome large win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows,
bringing pipes of water, and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging
cellars, have rendred it more commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</p>
                     <p>And as for thoſe Theories I mention'd,
they have not only advanced much the true
skill of the preſent Practiſers; but have
found that allowance among the learned
men of the Colledge, that they tye not
any man ſo ſtrictly in their examinations to
the Hypotheſis of the Ancients; but are
content with ſuch rational accounts of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
queſtions as his ſtudies have fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
him withal; provided be be vers'd
in the practical Theory or general maxims
thereof, which I call the rule of phyſick;
nay though in ſome of them he differs from
their opinion, not explicating the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
of humane bodies, or conjunct cauſes
of their preternatural affections by the
doctrine of the four Elements, but inſtead
thereof ſolidly anſwers thoſe Phyſiological
queſtions by the <hi>Williſian</hi> or <hi>Sylvian</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
they do not condemn him; the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

meet them at their Hoſpitals, where are
uſually a great variety of Patients lying ſick
of ſeveral diſeaſes; the Profeſſor as ſoon as

would make? and what methods of Cure
they would propoſe? And thus, when they
have variouſly given their judgment; he
commends one, reproves another, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courageth
all to diligent pains and ſtudy in
their profeſſion; then candidly delivers his
own judgment and prognoſtick, and directs
ſuch remedies as may be moſt ſerviceable

                     <p>Theſe Medicines are pen'd by his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,

that ſeeing our own Academies have no

his Majeſties Colledge of Phyſicians would
propoſe a method for obtaining ſome ſuch
laudable cuſtome, for the greater encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of all the ingenious in our Faculty,
that are educated in our own famous Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities,

which might not much more happily
be obtained in our own. For doubtleſs this
would not only conduce to the greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of our Art by uniting the Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick

whereby much publick ſervice
might be done to poſterity by acquainting

ſo much from all learned and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

what might be expected from the Members

much would the world be endebted to
them? if (having obtained the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57184:37"/>
and conſent of the Governors of our

take their turns to diſſect the bodies of thoſe

likewiſe of thoſe that dyed of diſtinct diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers?
How much this might tend to our

give me leave to ſay, that I am apt to think
that ſuch a deſign as this managed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding

of ſo noble a Science in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

contemptible by the ignorant Empiricks
of our dayes; but would give it ſuch a

the preference of others for the ſpeedy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancements
that might be made in the Art
of Phyſick, but likewiſe encourage <hi>Engliſh</hi>

But to proceed in acquainting you with
the method of taking Degrees in <hi>Leyden,</hi>
which is after the following manner.</p>
                     <p>Whenever any Student hath ſpent a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent
time in that Univerſity, or any Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner
comes over to take his Degree; he
firſt makes his application to the Dean of
the Faculty, who examines him one hour
in the Theoretick and Practick part of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick;
and if he finds him not well accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
in either, he interdicts him making
any farther progreſs in order to the taking
of a Degree, till he be better fitted for ſo
great an undertaking; but if he gives a
full and ſatisfactory account of his profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency
in both; he is ſent to viſit the reſt
of the Profeſſors of that Faculty, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing
a convenient time, do all meet
together and examine him two hours. And
if he be then approved, they give him two
Aphoriſms of <hi>Hippocrates</hi> to diſcourſe of
next day a quarter of an hour; and then
they oppoſe that explication for three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of an hour: after this he is to make
and print certain Theſes upon what ſubject
he pleaſeth, which he ſends to all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of the Univerſity, who meet him
at an appointed hour, and are Judges of
his abilities in the defence of thoſe Theſes
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:57184:38"/>
againſt the four Profeſſors of Phyſick, who
each man in his place acts the part of an
Opponent till an hour be ſpent; then is he
admitted by the Dean of the Faculty,
having obtain'd the approbation of the
<hi>Rector Magnificus</hi> and the reſt of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of the Univerſity to the Degree of
Doctor, and receiveth their <hi>diploma</hi> as a
teſtimonial of his due performance of all
the foremention'd exerciſes.</p>
                     <p>This in ſhort is the manner of taking De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees
privately, but if more publickly; the
perſon that takes his Degree is oppoſed by
Non-graduates in that Faculty in their
publick Schools, and the Profeſſors of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
with the reſt of the Profeſſors of the
Univerſity ſit by as Judges.</p>
                     <p>Now how ſlight ſoever Mr. <hi>H.</hi> hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd
to make the taking of Degrees
in foreign Univerſities, yet for this he is
to be commended, that he was as cautious
of paſſing an examination there as he hath

                     </p>
                     <p>And as for thoſe ingenious and learned

their Degrees in our own Univerſities, and
that all of them are ready to pay no ſmall

and were ſo far from thinking them unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
Judges of their own Art, that they
readily profer'd the examination by Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate
Statutes expected from them; and
never had they propoſed entring themſelves

Act of that Society and encouragement

                     <p>Our Adverſaries themſelves will allow
us in this, the preheminence, not out of

from the too great palpableneſs of their ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance

his impudence or ignorance were greateſt;

                  <p>ANatomy in general hath ſo far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
to the Cure of diſeaſes that it
hath laid the foundations of that noble
Art; by teaching us the nature and manner
of concoctions, excretions and motions of the
bloud and humors; the true and ſound
conſtitution of all the ſeveral parts, which
being compared with thoſe that have been
found in morbid bodies ſo much deviating
from the ſound ones, have not only given
greater light to the diſcovery of many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes

that great Indications are to be taken,
both for the exhibition of Medicines, and

As for inſtance; ſince the diſcharge of
the Liver from its ſanguifying office, and
affixing ſanguification to the vital ſpirits
reſiding in the bloud; it hath been clearly
demonſtrated that moſt diſeaſes do derive
their original from ſome ill affections of the
maſs of bloud, and not from the morbid
conſtitution of the <hi>viſcera,</hi> (which are
parts uſually but ſecondarily affected)
whereupon our remedies that have been
primarily indicated, have had their chief
reſpect to the reduction of the bloud to its
due and native Craſis; and not to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of Topicks, to thoſe parts which
never give the firſt occaſion to the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
dyſcraſie; for theſe are generally
in their healthful, genuine ſtate, until
the ſanguineous maſs doth affix ſome preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
recrements upon them: wherefore
the application of Epithemes, unguents,
emplaſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are ſound in ſeveral of the
foremention'd caſes not ſo ſerviceable as
was formerly thought; as particularly in
thoſe diſeaſes which were believ'd to derive
their original from a <hi>calida Epatis intemperies;</hi>
the primary cure of which depends upon the
diſcharge of thoſe bilious or ſulphureous

of them to their priſtine ſtate, by
internal and appropriate remedies; and
not upon Topical applications. I might
farther diſcourſe of Dropſies, Scurvy, and
other diſtempers of the like nature; which
were imagin'd to derive their original from
the <hi>viſcera,</hi> but that the judicious Reader
by conſidering that one caſe I mention'd,
may eaſily be induc'd to believe that in theſe
alſo the bloud and not the <hi>viſcera</hi> is the
primary ſeat of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>I could likewiſe inform Mr. <hi>H.</hi> of the
great advantages that might accrue to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
by that excellent diſcovery of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of the Chyle with the maſs of
bloud; it being well known that bloud
appearing with its Chyle ſwimming upon
it, hath till of late dayes been taken as
Sanious; and conſequently the perſon from
whoſe arm it hath been drawn, being poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
with the fancy of a Surfeit, may have
put himſelf upon methods of phyſick to
cure a fictitious diſeaſe, and thereby laid a
foundation for a real one.</p>
                  <p>And doubtleſs not only this, but many
other late Anatomick diſcoveries might
tend very much <hi>to the better cure of diſeaſes;</hi>
as for inſtance, the commixture of the air
with the maſs of bloud, which hath been
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:57184:46"/>
experimented ſo abſolutely neceſſary to the
maintaining of Animal life; that neither
the motion of the bloud nor ſpirits could be
preſerved without its continual ſupply; nay
though ſome time their motion hath been
impeded; yet upon a freſh and ſpeedy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
of air to the Heart and bloud,
they have both recover'd their priſtine ſtate.
Which puts me in mind of two excellent
obſervations to this purpoſe intimated by
the ingenious Doctor <hi>Thruſton</hi> in his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe
<hi>de reſpiratione;</hi> who there tells us of
an experiment of that accompliſh'd Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
and accurate Anatomiſt Doctor <hi>Croon,</hi>
who ſtifling a Chicken till ſhe ſeem'd quite
dead, yet a good while after by blowing
air into the Lungs revived it.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond was an experiment perform'd
by the no leſs accurate Anatomiſt, Doctor
<hi>Needham,</hi> who in a dog dead and opened,
after all ceſſations of pulſe, recover'd the
motion of the heart meerly by blowing up
air into the receptacle of the Chyle, which
from thence by its <hi>ductus</hi> was tranſmitted
into the maſs of bloud.</p>
                  <p>Now doubtleſs from theſe experiments,
and others of the like nature, much might
be collected for the improvement of the
practick part of our Art; eſpecially in thoſe
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:57184:47"/>
caſes, where we are apt to be too ſevere in
keeping our Patients from thoſe reviving
guſts of air, which probably might tend
much more to the depuration of the bloud
and refreſhment of the animal ſpirits, than
the greateſt Cordials that could have been
exhibited. Which puts me in mind of
what great relief I have ſeen inſtantly given
to Hyſterical Patients in acute diſeaſes by
allowing them freſh gales of air.</p>
                  <p>And no leſs to a young Gentleman in a
deep Conſumption, who was ſpeedily and
even to the wonder of all that knew him,
recover'd to a healthful ſtate by riding
five or ſixſcore miles into the countrey to
take the Air.</p>
                  <p>And within theſe few dayes diſcourſing
with the learned Doctor <hi>Bradey,</hi> Maſter of
<hi>Caius</hi> Colledge in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
practiſer in this Town, upon this
ſubject; he was pleaſed to acquaint me
with a very notable obſervation in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of this aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> in a Patient
of his, who being very highly Aſthmatick
and Hyſterick, and thereby neceſſitated to
keep her bed ſix winters together, found
conſtant and ſpeedy relief in the paroxyſms
of the foremention'd diſtempers, by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing
the curtains of her bed, putting
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:57184:47"/>
out the fire in her chamber, and letting in
air; and that which was very remarkable,
was, that in the greateſt of her extremities,
if the wind lay in the window, and the
caſements were opened, ſhe found ſo great
advantage thereby, that not content with
what paſſage Nature had made in her no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrils
for air, ſhe would dilate them with
her fingers, that it might be more plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
conveyed to her Lungs.</p>
                  <p>Which truly is not ſo much to be wonder'd
at, ſeeing the Atmoſphere is ſo highly impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
with nitrous particles, which as the
Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> hath well obſerved, are the only
refrigerating Cordials that can be exhibited.</p>
                  <p>And ſurely if the motion and florid co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
of the Arterial bloud do ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
upon a due commixture of the air;
and many diſeaſes and ſudden deaths are
occaſion'd by too great a craſſitude, roapi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and coagulation of the bloud; how
much might the free admiſſion of air into
the rooms of ſick and diſeaſed Patients, and
it may be (where we durſt not allow of
their riſing) the bare ſuction of it by ſome
artificial pipe contriv'd for that purpoſe, tend
to their more eaſie and ſpeedy recovery?</p>
                  <p>And if in high Fevers, deliriums, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that
excellent Phyſician <hi>Riverius</hi> would direct
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:57184:48"/>
the ſtrowing the Patients chambers with
green herbs, and pouring water out of one
tub or pail into another; ſurely theſe late
experiments may encourage us in ſeveral
caſes to admit of freſh gales of air into thoſe
Patients chambers, who are almoſt parch'd
up or ſuffocated for want thereof.</p>
                  <p>And truly if we conſider how many fair
and beautiful Ladies, in the prime and
flower of their years, are precipitated into
Phthiſicks and Conſumptions, from being
too cloſely mew'd up with their near rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
lying ſick of thoſe diſtempers; and
how many of thoſe afflicted with them, are
rendred incurable, and ſometimes ſpeedily
deſtroy'd by the inſpiration of air ſo highly
vitiated from their own morbid expirations;
I cannot imagine but the moſt ingenious
Phyſicians will allow me, that great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements
might be made hereby for the
better cure of diſeaſes, if we were as dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
in obſervation as we have been in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
which otherwiſe is really no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
than (as our adverſaries term it) <hi>the
ornamental part of phyſick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now 'tis high time to anſwer their
cry'd up objection taken out of <hi>Celſus,</hi> which
is as a late Author hath told us <hi>in plain
Engliſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="79" facs="tcp:57184:48"/>
That nothing is more fooliſh than to imagine
that things within a man ſhould be in the ſame
ſtate when he is dying, as they were when he
was living; much more when he is actually
dead; for, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> moſt diſeaſes lying in
the variations of bloud and humors, ſpirits
and ferments of the parts are cauſes remote
from ſuch ocular inſpection. And that nothing
certain can be concluded from the ſtagnation
of bloud or other humors found in any place or
paſſage of the body after death, is evident in
this, that nature upon deaths approach being
driven to moſt violent motions, does extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſate,
intravaſate, throw blood and humors
in and out, here and there, and every where,
Cap-a-pee, through the moſt abſtruſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perceivable
paſſages; ſo that if ſtagnant or
coagulated bloud, or other humors, be found
in any part by anatomizing, it cannot be
concluded it was ſo before death.</p>
                  <p>Thus far hath that ingenious Author en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to defend ſo ill a cauſe; which
endeavours had they been employed to
better purpoſes, I doubt not but he might
have been more ſerviceable to himſelf and
the Common-wealth of learning.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing his inclinations have engaged
him to different apprehenſions, I hope he
will pardon us that we refuſe to give him
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57184:49"/>
our aſſent to what he hath yet writ on this
ſubject; unleſs his reaſons were more co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
or prevailing.</p>
                  <p>For I would gladly have this Author ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
us, what alteration is made in the
body of a healthful man, when he dyeth
of a violent death as to thoſe things which
we enquire after; I mean as to the <hi>viſcera</hi>
and ſolid parts: do they loſe any thing
of their figure, connexion, proportion? <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
I confeſs that they are ſomething alter'd
as to their colour, but I hope we may ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
our ſelves as to the reaſon of that muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Which of the veſſels do we then
find wanting? The lacteals we acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
do then diſappear, and the Lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
too ſome time after death, but the
defect of theſe, vivi-ſection will ſupply.</p>
                  <p>And as for the reſt of the humors (the
bloud excepted) they receive no great al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration
in death, as witneſs the gall, urine,
Lympha, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as for the bloud it ſelf,
I hope we may obſerve both it and its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in the diſſection of living Animals, and
I am ſure we may diſcover its paſſages even
in dead bodies, by injections.</p>
                  <p>And what though we readily allow, <hi>that
moſt diſeaſes lye in the variation of the bloud
and humours, ſpirits and ferments;</hi> yet our
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57184:49"/>
Antagoniſt himſelf is willing to grant us,
that the morbid impreſſions they make
upon the ſeveral <hi>viſcera</hi> are viſible enough;
and ſo are the <hi>bloud and humors</hi> no leſs in
ſome diſeaſes, though he is pleaſed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
that they are <hi>cauſes remote from ocular
inſpection;</hi> as witneſs the inflammatory
blood that is uſually drawn from the arms
of Patients in Rheumatiſms, Quinſies,
Pleuriſies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the humors, there is enough to
be found for the proof thereof in <hi>Sylvius</hi> and
<hi>de Graef,</hi> who have acquainted the world
with what a variety of diſeaſes do owe their
original to the preternatural affections of
the bile, <hi>pituita,</hi> Lymphatick liquor and
pancreatick juice, all which may eaſily be
obtain'd, and that in ſome conſiderable
quantity, in living and dead, in ſound and
morbid bodies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And as for what is ſaid of</hi> the extravaſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and intravaſation; throwing bloud and
humors in and out, here and there and every
where, Cap-a-pee, through the moſt abſtruſe
and unperceivable paſſages in deaths ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs that I do not well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
this notion, till the Author hath bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
clear'd it: for according to my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:57184:50"/>
the impetuous and diſorderly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that he would fancy the humors to be
in at ſuch a time, ſhould be ſo far from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting
them into thoſe unperceivable paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,
that it ſhould altogether hinder their
motion through thoſe fictitious Meanders.</p>
                  <p>And farther let him give me leave to
tell him, that I am not of his belief that
the <hi>bloud and humors are then in ſuch an
impetuous motion;</hi> the languid pulſes of
moſt dying perſons affording us a ſufficient
argument to the contrary; and for my own
part (with ſubmiſſion to better judgments)
I am apt to think that the diſorder that is
obſerved in the body upon the approaches
of death, doth chiefly proceed from the
tumult of the Animal ſpirits, which are put
into thoſe diſorders and irregular motions
for want of a due ſupply of influential ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
from the maſs of bloud; which alas!
at that time is ſo far from being endued
with ſuch volatile and luxuriant parts to
occaſion this motion, that I take it not only
to be perverted in its whole craſis, but a
weak, confuſed, and depauperated liquor.</p>
                  <p>And farther as to what is ſaid of <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſation
and intravaſation in deaths ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches,</hi>
'tis as difficult to believe as all the
former, ſeeing that upon the point of death
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:57184:50"/>
we rarely obſerve <hi>maculae</hi> or <hi>exanthemata,
&amp;c.</hi> to appear, but uſually in the beginning
or augmentation of peſtilential or malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
diſeaſes; and if at that nick of time,
there ſhould be any appearance of extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated
bloud, 'tis as improbable to believe,
that it ſhould be again reſorb'd for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
above-mention'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And for what he ſaith,</hi> that if ſtagnant
or coagulated bloud or other humors be found
in any part by anatomizing, it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
it was ſo before death.</p>
                  <p>I judge it as difficult to imagine as all
the reſt; for what ſhould hinder my aſſent
from believing that there was a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
of aqueous humors in the bodies of Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropical
perſons whileſt alive, their bellies
being ſo tenſe and ſwell'd, though I do not
actually ſee it, till my knife diſcovers it?</p>
                  <p>And thus if we find the Cyſtick <hi>ductus</hi>
wholly obſtructed by any calculous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion
or viſcid bile, ſo that the gall being
replete and turgid can receive no more of
its felleous liquor from the blood; which
wanting its due ſeparation and diſcharge,
doth gradually ſo load and ſaturate it, that
it doth not only pervert its conſtituent prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
and the animal ſpirits originated from
them, but procure the patients death; ſhall
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:57184:51"/>
I queſtion whether this obſtruction of the
<hi>ductus</hi> and diſtention of the gall, were thus
whilſt the patient was living?</p>
                  <p>And thus ſuppoſe upon ſome ſudden rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
or eroſion of any of the veſſels of the
inward parts, there ſhould be a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
of blood into the brain, <hi>thorax</hi> or
<hi>abdomen,</hi> and the patient immediately dy,
ſhall I queſtion whether this breach was
there, or blood extravaſated before death
enſued?</p>
                  <p>Much more might be ſaid to this purpoſe,
but I ſhall now proceed no farther in an
Anatomical reply to this Author; but only
crave leave to tell him, that he hath done
his Chymical friends little ſervice in this
harangue againſt Anatomy; for ſince the
ſpagyrical <hi>Analyſis</hi> of bodies is made by fire
and <hi>menſtrua;</hi> 'tis notoriouſly known that
they are ſo much alter'd thereby, that ſuch
diviſions do not ſo much explicate parts as
deſtroy them; or at leaſt to uſe <hi>Helmont</hi>'s ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
convert them in <hi>alia entia.</hi> Whereas
the Anatomiſt doth only by wary inciſions
ſtill diſcover the more inward parts as
whole and unchanged as may be: and
when he cometh to diſſect any particular
part, as the Liver, Spleen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he firſt
vieweth what he intendeth to diſſect, and
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:57184:51"/>
ſtill proceeds leiſurely to obſerve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
veſſels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon their firſt appearance,
whileſt they are yet whole; he never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring
any thing with his knife, till having
ſufficiently conſider'd it, he thinks fit to
deſtroy it in order to ſome future diſcovery
of what is beyond it.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude, I appeal to any judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
man, whether with a curious knife he
may not diſcover more of an Animal than
he can by Chymical preparation.</p>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>The ſecond thing that I undertook to
prove was this:</head>
                     <p>That the Moderns had very much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd
the Anatomick part of phyſick by
their late diſcoveries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the clearing of this aſſertion I need
not take much pains, ſeeing 'tis well
known to moſt of our Faculty that there
hath been a more ſatisfactory and true ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
given to the world of the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
ſtructure and nutrition of humane bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> witneſs that excellent and full
account which Doctor <hi>Harvey</hi> hath ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
the world withal in his Treatiſe
<hi>de generatione Animalium:</hi> what ſervice
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:57184:52"/>
hath he done to the publick by that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing
and admirable diſcovery of the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation
of the blood, which hath ſince
been univerſally embraced, and given him ſo
great a name throughout the world? What
ſervice hath the incomparable Dr. <hi>Gliſſon</hi>
done our Faculty in giving us a more faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
account of the nature of ſanguification,
bilification, ſeparation of Urine and other
humors from the maſs of blood, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Doctor
<hi>Willis</hi> of nutrition, generation and ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the <hi>ſuccus nervoſus</hi> and Animal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
with their preternatural affections?
How lame and imperfect was our former
knowledge of the nature of the <hi>ſaliva</hi> and
other juices that are conveyed into the
mouth, together with their paſſages; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till
our famous countrey-man Doctor <hi>Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi>
and of late the learned <hi>Steno</hi> have gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
ſo full an account of them? Although
I am credibly inform'd, that the world is
chiefly indebted to the induſtry of that
great Anatomiſt Doctor <hi>Walter Needham,</hi>
for theſe later diſcoveries. Who ever
dreamt that the Lungs conſiſted only of
veſſels and bladders? that the Liver, Spleen
and Reins were conglomerate glandules,
untill that expert Anatomiſt and great Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt
<hi>Malpighius</hi> acquainted us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with?
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:57184:52"/>
Who ever imagined that the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the male ſhould only be a conglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration
of veſſels; and the female Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,
Ovaries, until the induſtrious and
learned <hi>de Graef</hi> diſcover'd it? Who ever
inſtructed us well as to the operation of
Cathartick medicines in humane bodies;
or as to the reaſon of the different colours of
the excrements that are obſerved to be eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuated
by them, untill that great Anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
light Sir G. <hi>Ent</hi> the Preſident and Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Colledge of Phyſicians? whoſe
learned Pen did likewiſe in thoſe early times
both defend and illuſtrate the Circulation of
the blood in that excellent Apology he made
for it againſt <hi>Pariſanus;</hi> and not only ſo,
but ſtart many other novel doctrines to
which we owe many of the more modern
Hypotheſes; which notwithſtanding had
never been improved to that height they
are now come to, had not he by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd
book, and by his frequent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications
to his Philoſophical friends
given many hints which occaſion'd excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
diſcoveries, of which that of the
<hi>ſuccus nervoſus</hi> is not the leaſt, which how
far it owneth him for the Author Doctor
<hi>Gliſſon</hi> doth ſufficiently witneſs in his
learned Treatiſe <hi>de Epate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="88" facs="tcp:57184:53"/>
And for the true conveyance of the Chyle
into the maſs of blood, which of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
were acquainted there with? 'Tis true,
they own'd its diſcharge through the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeraick
veins into the Liver; but were as
ignorant of its true paſſage into the blood,
as they were of giving us any clear demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
of the commixture of the air there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with,
which notwithſtanding they taught
in their Schools as an <hi>Ens rationis,</hi> having
no experimental proof for the truth of this
aſſertion.</p>
                     <p>How much then is the world beholden
to the great induſtry and indefatigable pains
of that great Anatomiſt Doctor <hi>Lower,</hi> who
in that incomparable book of his <hi>de Corde</hi>
(one of the moſt fertile for clear ſatisfactory
and experimental demonſtration, that ever
yet hath been printed) hath not only more
plainly evinced the true paſſage of the
Chyle through its lacteals, receptacle, and
chyliferous ducts, than formerly; but as
unanſwerably demonſtrated that there can
be no other, by which it ſhould have its
diſcharge into the maſs of blood? And if
the Reader pleaſeth to peruſe thoſe experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his, whereby he hath as ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily
proved the commixture of the
nitrous particles of the air with the maſs
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:57184:53"/>
of blood, he may find them as clear and
demonſtrative as the former.</p>
                     <p>And though the circulation of the blood
was happily diſcover'd by the great Doctor
<hi>Harvey,</hi> yet the velocity of its motion and
circulation, was never ſo clearly and
fully evinced as it hath been by Doctor
<hi>Lower:</hi> and how much this may tend to
the clearing up of ſeveral of the dark and
obſcure <hi>phaenomena</hi> of nature; as the ſpeedy
paſſage of liquors from the ſtomach to the
reins, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I leave to the ingenious of our
Faculty to determine? And doubtleſs great
ſervice he hath done us, in clearing out the
nature, origination, conveyance and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
of milk in the breaſts of women;
a doctrine ſo much controverted in former
ages. And no leſs ſervice have the learned
Doctor <hi>Walter Needham</hi> and Doctor <hi>Lower</hi>
done us, in their experimental demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the circulation of the Chyle with
the maſs of blood ſome hours before its
aſſimilation: which diſcovery with many
(if not all) of the former, are to be admired,
not only for the truth and excellency of
their invention, but for their great uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
in phyſick, as I have before mention'd.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore 'tis apparent that theſe diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
have not only tended to the better
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:57184:54"/>
cure of diſeaſes (as I lately proved) but
have likewiſe been very advantageous in
affording us more uſeful Hypotheſes in phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick;
for our principles having been more
certain and demonſtrative, it were very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
to conceive that our foundations
ſhould not be more firmly laid than the
Ancients, who were not acquainted with
the diſtribution and natural motions of the
nutritious humor, blood, nervous and
Lymphatick liquors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Since the inveſtigation of which the
world hath been made happy with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
writings both of foreigners and our
own countrey-men.</p>
                     <p>One of which (I mean the learned Doctor
<hi>Willis)</hi> hath ſatisfied the world ſo well with
his excellent and ſurpaſſing abilities in that
kind, that his Name as well as his writings
will be admired both in our own and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
ages.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And if (as Noble Mr.</hi> Boyl <hi>hath acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
us)</hi> Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato, and
diverſe others of thoſe (whoſe wiſdom made
after Ages reverence Antiquity) did not only
eſteem the truths of Nature worth ſtudying
for, but thought them too worth travelling for,
as far as thoſe Eaſtern countreys, whoſe wiſe
men were then cryed up for the beſt Expoſitors
of the obſcure book of Nature:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="91" facs="tcp:57184:54"/>
How much reaſon then have we and the
learned world, to bewail our unhappineſs
in the loſs of one of the greateſt and clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Commentators thereon?</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Witneſs that ingenious explication of the</hi>
phaenomena <hi>of thoſe ſtupendous caſes he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints
us with in his book</hi> de morbis convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſivis,
&amp;c. <hi>and though he frankly confeſſeth
that in his explication of the theory of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
he doth not tread in the footſteps of
the Ancients, but his Hypotheſes are alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
new; yet ſaith that learned Author,
they are ſuch,</hi> quae ſuper obſervatis Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micis
fundatae, ac firmiter ſtabilitae; aegro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantium
phaenomena quaeque melius ſolvunt,
ſymptomatum cauſas aptius declarant, &amp; me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendi
rationes unicuique affectui magis accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modas
ſuggerunt; Which being more firmly
founded and eſtabliſhed upon Anatomical obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations,
do better ſolve the <hi>phaenomena</hi> of the
ſick, more aptly diſcover the cauſes of their
ſymptoms, and ſuggeſt more appropriate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
for the cure of every affection.</p>
                     <p>And though <hi>Sylvius</hi> his Hypotheſis hath
not been ſo univerſally embraced by our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Phyſicians, yet in foreign parts it
hath met with no leſs acceptance from the
moſt learned and judicious of our Faculty,
than the foremention'd; his Ternary of
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:57184:55"/>
humors being queſtion'd by none of the
Anatomiſts of our dayes; from the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
and exorbitancy of which, he would
derive all the preternatural affections of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
bodies; but however, whether his
Hypotheſis be true or not, 'tis known very
well to his friends and enemies too, that his
ſucceſs in practice hath given him a reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
not only in the <hi>Low Countryes,</hi> but
amongſt moſt of the learned men in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Which hath occaſion'd your worthy
friend <hi>M. N.</hi> to acknowledg that <hi>he hath
done the world more ſervice towards the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
of the Art of Phyſick, than ever any
man did before him in the United Provinces:</hi>
and how kind and generous he hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly
been to Doctor <hi>Willis,</hi> in acquainting
all the learned of our Faculty, how much
they were indebted to him for that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Treatiſe of his <hi>de febribus,</hi> I ſhall have
occaſion ere long to acquaint them with.</p>
                     <p>But if all this will not ſatisfie Mr. <hi>H.</hi> of
the improvements that our Moderns have
made, whereby <hi>they have done ſomething
more worth than a ſtraw, beyond what the
Ancients have done,</hi> I would adviſe him to
read over what I have diſcours'd of in the
precedent particular; and what he may
find in the latter part of that Section which
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:57184:55"/>
treats of Chymiſtry; and if he can ſpare
ſo much time from his quacking avocations,
I would recommend to his ſerious peruſal
that excellent book of Doctor <hi>Lower</hi>'s,
called <hi>Pyretologia Williſiana;</hi> which was
written againſt his countrey-man <hi>Meara</hi>
upon this very matter of conteſt between
my ſelf and him; (which having been
printed in the ſame year that his beloved
friend's was printed in, and received no
anſwer to it from its moſt avowed Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries
<hi>for eleven years;</hi> methinks it ſhould
be own'd for a much more <hi>unanſwerable</hi>
book than <hi>M. N</hi>'s. which hath had four
ſatisfactory anſwers already to it) whereby
I ſhould be in ſome hopes that he might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
be reduc'd to his wits again, which
were unfortunately loſt when he wrote this
ſcandalous Pamphlet againſt the Colledge
of Phyſicians, though he ſpared not for
<hi>pen, ink nor paper.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And though Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and ſome others of
his acquaintance would ſeem to commend
the Ancients by this aſſertion; that our
late Anatomiſts <hi>have done nothing by Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
worth a ſtraw, beyond what was done by
the Ancients;</hi> I take it to be, not out of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or skill in them, of which they are
generally ignorant; much leſs out of love
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:57184:56"/>
to them, whom they contemn as oft as they
are thwarted by them; as witneſs the
principal if not ſole deſign of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
book Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſo highly commends,
which tells us, <hi>that we muſt proceed by other
definitions of the nature of diſeaſes, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dagations
of their cauſes, and invent other
remedies and reaſons and rules of curation,
than what have been delivered by the Ancients,
and not confine our ſelves to their conceptions,
aphoriſms and inventions,</hi> &amp;c and chargeth
<hi>the Ariſtotelians and Galeniſts</hi> for <hi>ſuperſtiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
devotion to their old heatheniſh authors;</hi>
and their Sectators as <hi>drones of the old me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical
Hive;</hi> that practiſe in the <hi>ordinary
dog-road of Phyſick,</hi> and therefore calls them,
<hi>the herd of vulgar Methodiſts;</hi> and the <hi>old
way of practice, lazy; its principles dull, and
the bane of our profeſſion,</hi> &amp;c. which is a
plain demonſtration that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> in this aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion
did only uſe the Ancients as an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
to pull down modern diſcoveries.</p>
                     <p>Whereas we profeſs our ſelves to have a
great reſpect and veneration for them, as
having done great things in Phyſick in
their times, for which we and our poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
will own our ſelves highly obliged,
and readily allow the great honour that was
due to their names: yet are we not ſo ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:57184:56"/>
as to believe all their doctrines as
infallible, or that they had ſearcht ſo fully
into Natures myſteries, that nothing was
left to future induſtry to diſcover; and
therefore I will be bold to ſay, that though
there hath been ſo great pains, and much
more than I can acquaint the world with,
taken to inveſtigate the nature of humane
bodies, with the ſeveral juices and ferments
that are lodg'd in them, yet many things
belonging to them are yet unobſerved, and
others ſo obſcurely and diſſatisfactorily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd;
as may ſtill lay an obligation upon
all the ingenious of our Faculty to diligent
ſearch and enquiry.</p>

ſome conceiving digeſtion to be caus'd by
heat, others by an acid humor from the
Spleen; which laſt opinion hath juſtly been
exploded by our later Anatomiſts, by reaſon
there are no paſſages to be found, by which
this humor may be conveyed from the
Spleen into the ſtomach, and therefore
others have aſſerted it to have its paſſage
through the gaſtrick Arteries, and its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply

to diſcover the ſtomachical acidity, to which

aſcribe the firſt digeſtion of the nutriment of
Animals, in the purpoſely diſſected ſtomachs of
ravenous Sea-fiſhes; in whoſe ſtomachs though
our taſte could not perceive any ſenſible acidity,
yet we found in one of them a couple of fiſhes
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:57184:61"/>
each of them about a foot long, whereof the one,
which ſeem'd but to have been newly devour'd,
had ſuffer'd little or no alteration in the great

ſave the head, uniformly waſted to a

                     <p>And truly I muſt be ſo free to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
to the world, that from theſe and

ſome progreſs in it; but there being ſo great

                     <p>In the mean time I am ſure that all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
men will allow me, that many
things in our Art may ſtill be diſcovered
by future induſtry; which occaſioned the
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:57184:62"/>
learned <hi>de Graef</hi> to uſe this expreſſion, <hi>quod
poſt mille ſecula indefeſſis naturae ſcrutatoribus
quaedam invenienda ſunt, that after a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
ages ſome things will be found out by the
diligent and indefatigable ſearchers of nature:</hi>
and therefore I think we have more reaſon
to be ſorry that no more hath been done
in Anatomical diſcoveries, than to quarrel
with men for knowing and doing ſo
much.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>But now 'tis high time to acquaint the
world how unworthily and injuriouſly
Mr.</hi> H. <hi>and ſome other of his friends have
treated that great improver of learning and
encourager of all Arts and Sciences, the
honourable Mr.</hi> Boyle. <hi>The occaſion of his
quoting him, you may find</hi> p. 15. <hi>where
having told us that Anatomy is,</hi> the laſt
part Phyſicians have to play, or trick to ſhew,
to entertain Spectators and amuſe the world,
to uphold ſome repute among ſuch as are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant,
and draw on cuſtomers; ſo that it is
wonderful to ſee how many, even of the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
and gentry as well as the citizens, are
taken by this ſort of trick, the mock-ſhews of
pretended diſcovery by Anatomy; <hi>he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
to confirm this theatrical harangue
againſt that noble Art by the following
quotation.</hi> But how little is to be expected
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:57184:62"/>
from ſuch Actors, that Honourable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Mr. <hi>Boyl</hi> tells you, in his book of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
Philoſophy, where he ſaith, he doth
not ſee wherein by <hi>any</hi> of thoſe new diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
<hi>any</hi> thing hath been done, to <hi>better</hi> the
cure of diſeaſes, <hi>and then adds,</hi> you may take
his word.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Now how unjuſtly he hath abuſed that
noble Author, not only in the unfaithful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting
his deſign, for which he there
diſcours'd of Anatomical diſcoveries, but
likewiſe in the falſe quoting of that paſſage,
that it might ſerve his purpoſe; you may
obſerve in the following account; if you
pleaſe to conſult Mr.</hi> Boyles <hi>ſecond part of
the uſefulneſs of experimental Philoſophy,</hi>
p. 222, 223. <hi>where diſſwading from the</hi>
neglect of uſeful remedies, becauſe preſented
by perſons that ignore them, and perhaps too,
hold opinions contrary to them, <hi>he leaves the
Reader,</hi> to conſider what is in the perſon of
the Empirical ſect repreſented by <hi>Celſus,
which you may there read; and then tells
you, that</hi> though this ſentence aſcribes too
little to reaſon, yet there is ſomething in it
that deſerves to be conſider'd, eſpecially ſince
we obſerve not that the <hi>late</hi> Anatomical diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
of the <hi>motions of the Chyle <hi>&amp;</hi> Lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatick
liquor,</hi> by formerly unknown wayes
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:57184:63"/>
in newly detected veſſels, hath yet made men
cure diſeaſes <hi>much better</hi> than before. Not
that I think that Anatomical &amp; Pathological
diſcoveries will not in proceſs of time, (when
the <hi>Hiſtoria facti,</hi> ſhall be fully and indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
made out, and the Theories there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
ſuggeſted clearly eſtabliſhed) highly
conduce to the improvement of the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rapeutical
part of phyſick; but yet this obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
may make it the more reaſonable to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware
of relying ſo much upon the yet diſputable
opinions of Phyſicians, as to deſpiſe all pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes,
though uſually ſucceſsful, that agree not
with them.</p>
                     <p>Thus have I faithfully and fully tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed
what that Noble perſon hath ſaid of this
ſubject, that all Phyſicians may take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
how unworthily he is treated by the
Empiricks of our dayes, who are as much
pleaſed with any paſſage they can meet
with in that excellent Author, which they
fancy may be made ſerviceable to their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns,
as they have been with their confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the learned Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> in the
title pages of their books; but I hope that
none of our Faculty will ever give credit
to any quotation of theirs, without a due
examination of the Authors deſign: for
'tis plain by this account that I have given
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:57184:63"/>
of Mr. <hi>Boyles</hi> quotation, that he hath been
ſo far from diſcourſing againſt Anatomy,
that he hath ſpoken as much in the favour
thereof as any of our Moderns would have
done; and therefore, as if he had foreſeen
this vile ſort of men, that would abuſe
theſe excellent paſſages, he wrote them with
ſo much caution, that one could have
ſcarcely imagin'd, that a man who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
<hi>to cure the poor members of Jeſus freely
for his ſake,</hi> durſt have been guilty of ſuch
apparent and malicious falſehoods, and
that to maintain ſo bad a cauſe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I ſhall therefore for the prevention of
theſe Empiricks for the future from quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
any paſſages out of Mr.</hi> Boyl <hi>againſt
Anatomy, acquaint the world out of this
very book, what a great honour and vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
he hath for this noble Art; where
you may find in the firſt part of it,</hi> p. 5.
<hi>that telling us, that</hi> one would think that
the converſing with dead and ſtinking car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſes
(that are not only hideous objects in
themſelves, but made more ghaſtly by putting
us in mind that our ſelves muſt be ſuch) ſhould
be not only a very melancholy, but a very
hated employment. And yet, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> there
are Anatomiſts that dote upon it. And I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
its inſtructiveneſs hath not only ſo recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:57184:64"/>
me to it, but ſo enamour'd me of it, that
I have often ſpent hours much leſs delightfully,
not only in Courts, but even in Libraries, than
in tracing in thoſe forſaken Manſions, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable
workmanſhip of the Omniſcient Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitect.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And in</hi> p. 9. <hi>he tells us, that,</hi> were we
not lull'd aſleep by cuſtom or ſenſuality, it could
not but trouble as well as it injures a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
ſoul to ignore the ſtructure and contrivance
of that admirably organiz'd body, in which ſhe
lives, and to whoſe intervention ſhe owes the
knowledge ſhe hath of other Creatures.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And in the ſecond part of the ſame book,</hi>
p. 9. <hi>he poſitively aſſerts,</hi> that ſince diverſe
things in Anatomy, as particularly the motion
of the bloud and Chyle cannot be diſcovered in
a dead diſſected body (where the cold hath ſhut
up and obliterated many paſſages) that may
be ſeen in one opened alive; it muſt be very
advantageous to a Phyſicians Anatomical know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
to ſee the diſſections of Dogs, Swine
and other live creatures; <hi>which puts me in
mind of what a very learned Phyſician in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geniouſly
obſerved,</hi> that Dogs, Pigs, and
Monkyes, have contributed more to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement
of Phyſick, than this ſort of men
ever did or are like to do.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="103" facs="tcp:57184:64"/>
                        <hi>But to proceed in a further account of
the great eſtimation that this noble Author
had for Anatomy, which you may find in</hi>
p. 46. <hi>of the ſame book, where he tells you,
that</hi> not only the diſſections of ſound beaſts
may aſſiſt the Phyſician to diſcover the like parts
of a humane body, but the diſſection of morbid
beaſts may ſometimes illuſtrate the doctrine of
the cauſes and ſeats of diſeaſes. For that
this part of Pathology has been very much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the diligence of modern Phyſicians,
by diſſecting the bodies of men killed by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes,
we might juſtly be accuſed of want of
curioſity or gratitude, if we did not thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
acknowledge; for indeed much of that
improvement of Phyſick (for which the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
were they now alive, might envy our new
Phyſicians) may, in my poor opinion, be
aſcribed to our induſtrious ſcrutiny of the ſeat
and effects of the peccant matter of diſeaſes
in the bodies of thoſe that have been deſtroyed
by them. <hi>And in the ſame page he blames</hi>
the acute <hi>Helmont</hi> for not having been a more
diligent diſſector of beaſts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And in the following page he tell us, that</hi>
here we may alſo conſider, that there are diverſe
explications of particular diſeaſes, or trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
accidents propoſed by Phyſicians, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſince the diſcovery of the bloods circulation,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:57184:65"/>
wherein the compreſſion, obſtruction, or irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſome Nerve, or diſtenſion of ſome Vein
by too much blood, or ſome hindrance of the
free paſſage of the bloud through this or that
particular Veſſel, is aſſigned for the cauſe of
this or that diſeaſe or ſymptome; Now in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
of theſe caſes the liberty lately mention'd,
that a skilful Diſſector may take in beaſts, to
open the body or limbs, to make Ligatures
strong or weak on their Veſſels or other inward
parts, as occaſion ſhall require, to leave them
there as long as he pleaſeth, to prick or apply
ſharp liquors to any Nervous or Membranous
part, and whenever he thinks convenient, to
diſſect the Animal again, to obſerve what
change his experiment hath produced there:
Such a liberty, I ſay, which is not to be taken
in humane bodies, may in ſome caſe either con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
or confute the Theories propoſed, and ſo
put an end to diverſe Pathological controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,
and perhaps too, occaſion the diſcovery
of the true and genuine cauſes of the <hi>phaeno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena</hi>
diſputed of, or of others really as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struſe.</p>
                     <p>Now, pray Mr. <hi>H.</hi> can any unprejudic'd
or impartial perſon read this account
Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> hath given of his eſtimation for
Anatomy, and yet believe that <hi>little is to be
expected from it, and that he doth not ſee where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57184:65"/>
by any of thoſe new diſcoveries, any thing
hath been done to better the cure of diſeaſes?</hi>
I am apt to think he cannot; and if ſo,
what reaſon hath Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to peruſe theſe
paſſages with bluſhing Cheeks (if he
hath either ingenuity or modeſty left him)
and come and ſupplicate pardon of that
Noble perſon, for that injury he hath done
him in publick print?</p>
                     <p>The third Aſſertion was this,</p>
                  </div>
                  <div type="part">
                     <head>That the greateſt Anatomiſts and Practiſers
of our Age have been the greateſt Chymists.</head>
                     <p>For the proof of this, I need not take any
great pains; ſeeing two of our lateſt Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſts
and greateſt Practiſers may afford
us ſo clear a teſtimony to the truth of this
Aſſertion, I mean the eminently learned
Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> and <hi>Sylvius;</hi> both which
excellent Phyſicians have obtained an uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
reputation throughout the world,
for their admirable accompliſhments in the
Anatomick and practick part of Phyſick;
and how highly they did eſteem of Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy,
their great induſtry and pains there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
with their learned writings drawn
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:57184:66"/>
from that fountain, will ſufficiently teſtifie
to all poſterity; witneſs that incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
book of Doctor <hi>Willis de Cerebro,</hi> with
what he hath wrote <hi>de ventriculo, intestinis
&amp; pulmonibus;</hi> and <hi>Sylvius</hi> his <hi>diſputationes
Medicae;</hi> and though a friend of Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
would perſwade us <hi>that</hi> Sylvius <hi>his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines
had not their riſe from Academies,
but from his own and others Laboratories;</hi>
yet I believe he will ſcarcely be credited
by any ingenious Phyſician, that hath been
converſant in his writings; for 'tis plain
that Anatomy not Chymiſtry laid the firſt
foundation of his Ternary of humors;
by which he and his Diſciples ever ſince
have endeavour'd, not only to explicate the
<hi>phaenomena</hi> of all diſtempers; but as ſtre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuouſly
to defend.</p>
                     <p>And for Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> he hath plainly told
us that his Pathological diſcourſes are eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
upon Anatomical obſervations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Now that both theſe great men were
not meanly verſed in the Spagyrical Art,
I am ſure your</hi> unanſwerable <hi>friend will
allow us; for as to the latter he hath told
us,</hi> that he raiſed moſt of his doctrines from
Chymical experiments, and verified them
with pleaſant and ſpeedy cures, by joyning
the uſe of plants and minerals together, both
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:57184:66"/>
Chymically prepared, which hath rendred him
worthy the reading and imitating; <hi>and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſaith,</hi> that the forementioned doctrines
had not their riſe from the Ancients, but moſt of
them from Laboratories of his own and others,
wrought out of the fire for near forty years toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and confirmed by conſtant practice among
the ſick; in which work of curing he excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
all his Fellows in the most difficult caſes.</p>
                     <p>And as to the former, he hath acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to the world <hi>eleven years agone</hi> in
publick print, that he was <hi>a Phyſician in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
and Philoſopher by fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third I ſhall here name, is that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
Chymiſt <hi>Borrichius,</hi> whoſe affection
to Anatomy hath been ſo great and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing;
that he hath been ſo far from
thinking <hi>a year or half a years study ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
for its attainment;</hi> that he hath not
only ſpent vaſt pains and labour in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection
of humane bodies, but hath expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
even the greateſt curioſity of any one
in our Age for the advancement of our
Art by Anatomick diſcoveries; and ſo far
was this generous ſoul, from eſteeming it
an honour for <hi>Paracelſus</hi> (whom I hope
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will own for a Chymiſt) to be
thought an adverſary to Anatomy; that
his learned Pen hath been particularly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:57184:67"/>
to vindicate him from that aſperſion
ſo unjuſtly caſt upon him by <hi>Conringius;</hi>
and therefore he acquaints the world with
<hi>Paracelſus</hi> his great induſtry in the diſſecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of ſeveral Animals; and gives this
following account of that great eſtimation,
that famous Chymiſt had for Anatomy,
out of his own works; which making
much to our preſent purpoſe I ſhall crave
leave to tranſcribe.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And firſt, in his</hi> fragment, de peſte, <hi>he
tells us, that</hi> Paracelſus <hi>taught,</hi> Vulnerum
curam ex partium laeſarum naturâ cognoſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam;
that the cure of wounds was to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
from underſtanding the nature of the
parts affected. <hi>In his 11. Book</hi> de morbis
verm. <hi>he aſſerts,</hi> ex Anatome conſtare, ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes
quandoque piam duramque matrem per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudiſſe
&amp; profectam inde phreneſin, vermes
item in ſplene, felle, &amp; pulmonibus genitos,
That it doth appear from Anatomy, that Worms
have ſometimes made their paſſage through the
membranes of the Brain, and from thence a
Phrenſie hath been occaſion'd; and alſo, that
Worms have been generated in the Spleen,
Gall, and Lungs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And in his Book,</hi> de vit. long. <hi>cap. 11.</hi>
principio, inquit, conſiderantur partes ejus,
&amp; hae ex locali Anatomiâ per locum totius
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:57184:67"/>
phyſici corporis, cum intellectu medullarum,
conditionum, uſus ligamentorum, formarum
oſſium, &amp; cartilaginis, nervorum, carnis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietatum,
ſeptemque principalium membro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

teipſum intelligas ad hanc regulam; principio
oportet probè cognitam habeamus univerſam
rationem atque naturam cùm phyſici corporis,
tum phyſicae vitae: In the beginning, <hi>ſaith
he,</hi> are to be conſidered the parts, and theſe
from local Anatomy, through the ſeveral parts
of a natural body, with an underſtanding of
the nature of medullary juices, of embalmings,
uſe of the ligaments, ſhape of the bones, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilages
and nerves, properties of the fleſh,
offices of the ſeven principal members; that
whatever thou doſt in phyſical bodies, thou
mayeſt understand thy ſelf according to this
rule; in the beginning it behoves us that we
well underſtand the univerſal conſtitution and
nature as well of a natural body as a natural
life.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>And further, ſaith</hi> Borrichius, <hi>I think it
will appear how great</hi> Paracelſus <hi>was in
the Anatomy of beaſts from his Book,</hi> de
peſtilit. tract. 1. <hi>where he ſaith,</hi> contemplare
leonem &amp; felem, quàm omninò Anatome docet
utrumque formâ &amp; habitu omni corporis invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cem
convenire: contemplate the Lion and Cat,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:57184:68"/>
which Anatomy doth teach to be alike in the
form and habit of their bodies. <hi>And in his
Hiſtory of the Lion;</hi> feles, inquit, tam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignem
habent conformationem cum leonibus,
ut fundamentum quaſi habere videatur fabula
in Alcorano inventa, ubi narratur, quod felis
in arcâ prognata ſit ex ſternutatione leonis.
Catts, ſaith he, have ſuch an exact conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with Lions, that the fable invented in the
Alcoran may ſeem to have its foundation from
this, which tells you, that the Cat was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
in the Ark from the ſneezing of the
Lion. <hi>Nay further, in his Book</hi> de ulceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
gallicis, prolixe probat uſum genuinae Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes;
he largely demonſtrates the uſe of genuine
Anatomy; <hi>and ſo far was</hi> Paracelſus <hi>from
being an Adverſary to this excellent Art,
that</hi> Borrichius <hi>tells us,</hi> quod ſcripta <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celſi</hi>
fatentur ex Anatomiâ cujuſvis medici
initium &amp; finem eſſe, that the writings of
<hi>Paracelſus</hi> do teſtifie that the beginning and
end of every Phyſician is from Anatomy:
<hi>and to conclude, he gives us this character
of that great Chymiſt,</hi> quod progreſſus est
in Anatome ultra vulgatas Anatomicorum
metas, that his proficiency and excellency was
ſuch in Anatomy, that he exceeded the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
attainments of Anatomiſts.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:57184:68"/>
Now having thus brought ſo great a
teſtimony for Anatomy out of the works of
the greateſt and moſt applauded Chymiſts of
former Ages and of our own too; I hope
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will not be ſo bold for the future, as
to ſpeak ſo contemptibly againſt that noble
Art; And leſt he ſhould ſuſpect by this
commendation of <hi>Paracelſus</hi> for Anatomy,
that <hi>Borrichius</hi> was a man who gave not
Chymiſtry its juſt value and due; let me
recommend to his peruſal thoſe two incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable
books that he hath wrote of that
ſubject, the one <hi>de ortu &amp; progreſſu Chymiae;</hi>
the other <hi>Hermetis, Aegyptiorum &amp; Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum
ſapientia ab Hermanni Conringii ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſionibus
vindicata;</hi> whereby he muſt
be neceſſitated to own him; not only as a
profound Chymiſt, underſtanding the riſe,
progreſs, and nature of that Art better than
himſelf and all his companions; but as
Maſter of greater <hi>Arcana</hi> in Chymiſtry than
any they can reaſonably pretend to; yea ſo
great an Antiquary and univerſal Scholar
hath he approved himſelf by the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
books, that his learning and worth
will be had in eſtimation by our own and
ſucceeding ages.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>I might further acquaint Mr.</hi> H. <hi>with
the ingenious Doctor</hi> Daniel Cox, <hi>a man
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:57184:69"/>
better verſed in the Art of Chymiſtry, than
any of Mr. H's Society; and yet ſo far from
being an Adverſary to Anatomy, that he
hath publickly told the world,</hi> that no Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician,
who hath any ſpark of curioſity or ſenſe
of his duty, but will endeavour to acquaint
himſelf with theſe great proceſſes of Nature,
the preparation of the food, its diſtribution;
reſpiration, muſcular motion, and generation;
to which we may add the excluſion of what is
uſeleſs or burdenſome: and then he can be no
longer a stranger to her regular actings, and
knows what are moſt likely to continue them
ſuch without interruption: but to attain this
knowledge, the Phyſician muſt be at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
of much money, time and labour, this
skill not coming by inſpiration, but is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
of innumerable experiments and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and therefore one diſſection of a dead
man is not ſufficient to inform him, but he
converſeth with many other Animals living or
dead, whereon he makes numerous experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
which by Analogy and induction he
applies to man.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Now that this ingenious Phyſician is no
leſs acquainted with Chymical proceſſes,
than Anatomical diſſections, I might eaſily
prove by what he hath already acquainted
the world withal, as to the great induſtry
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:57184:69"/>
and pains that he hath taken in the inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the nature of vegetables,</hi> &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<hi>(as he hath told us)</hi> he can by an eaſie and
genuine method prepare ſimples ſo that their
whole <hi>Craſis</hi> ſhall be preſerved entire, their
vertues rather heightned than in the leaſt
impaired; <hi>and as for flowers, he can by</hi>
a moſt natural and facile method without ſo
much as the help of culinary fire, convert them
into liquors exceedingly ſpirituous, which may
be kept without loſs of vertue for many years;
<hi>nay,</hi> without any additament to vegetables
than what they may receive from the air, <hi>he
can</hi> procure copiouſly a Liquor, which rectifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
is not to be diſtinguiſhed from ſpirit of
Bloud, Soot, Harts-horn or other Urinous ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
or ſalts; and mixed with highly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlegmed
ſpirit of Wine, will coagulate into
the <hi>offa alba. I might likewiſe mention
thoſe excellent Experiments of his, lately
communicated to the Royal Society;
where he hath at large proved that</hi> alcaliſate
or fixed ſalts extracted out of the Aſhes of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables,
Volatile ſalts, and Vinous ſpirits do not
differ from each other. <hi>And as for Medicines
of the higher form in Chymiſtry, I wiſh
Mr.</hi> H. <hi>could produce ſuch as that ingenious
Doctor is Maſter of,</hi> whoſe extraordinary
effects he hath ſeen and can witneſs; as the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:57184:70"/>
Volatile ſalt of Tartar, Baſilius Valentinus his
Tincture of Antimony, Tinctura Lilii, Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monts
Laudanum, his Aroph Paracelſi; the
Anodyne Sulphur of Vitriol, its Eſſential oyl,
the tincture of gold, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>And that I might not ſeem too tedious
upon this ſubject, I will acquaint Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
at preſent but with one more, who was no
contemptible Chymiſt, though his Talent
lay much more in practiſe; and for that he
hath had an univerſal eſteem from all learned
men; who have been converſant in his book
<hi>de peſte:</hi> now for what eſtimation this
learned Author <hi>Diemerbroeck</hi> hath for Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy,
you may judge by his Epiſtle to that
late Body of Anatomy, that he hath pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed
where he tells you, <hi>quod Medica Ars
ſine Anatomicâ vix ſolidis fundamentis inni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur,
&amp; haec ſine illâ inutilis eſt. That the
Medical Art without the Anatomical is ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fixed upon ſolid foundations, and without
it 'tis nothing worth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now pray, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> inform us, whether
we may not more rationally hope for greater
things from theſe mens labours, who are
not leſs acquainted with the ſtructure of
humane bodies and Philoſophical improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
than they are with the Spagyrical
Art; than from an Empirical crew of men,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:57184:70"/>
who can pretend to little better education
than a Smiths Anvil, or ſome ſuch Mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical
trade? For 'tis ſufficiently proved by
the Honourable Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> in that incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
book of his ſo often mention'd, that
the Naturaliſts knowledge doth highly tend
to the advancement of our Faculty in all
parts of the Medical Art, which indeed
was the principal, if not ſole deſign of the
Authors writing that Treatiſe; to which
I ſhall refer all ingenious perſons, not
doubting but upon a ſerious peruſal thereof,
they will not only clearly diſcover the utter
incapacity of our <hi>London</hi> Empiricks from
making any future pretenſions to improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
in Phyſick; but readily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
the great obligations they owe to our
famous Univerſities and learned Colledge
of Phyſicians in <hi>London,</hi> from whoſe foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
have been derived thoſe great diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries
both in Nature and Art, relating
to the Medical Science, whereby men may
more happily be cured of their diſeaſes and
enjoy the bleſſings of a happy and pleaſant
life.</p>

                  <p>I Shall in this Section endeavour to ſhew
that Phyſicians educated in Univerſities,
and particularly Members of the Colledge
of Phyſicians, have been ſo far from being
the hinderers of the Art of Chymiſtry, that
they have been the great Improvers and
promoters of it.</p>
                  <p>As to the clearing of this Aſſertion to the
ſatisfaction of all Impartial Readers; I
ſhall crave leave to acquaint them; that our
conteſt at preſent with this Empirical
tribe of men, is not about the antiquity,
excellency, or uſefulneſs of this Art; nor
yet about the <hi>Arcana majora</hi> in that Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
which the Ancients did endeavour
to perſwade the world they were Maſters
of; for, by the by, let me tell them, that
they have exploded their doctrines and
principles, which were the very ſame with
<hi>Ariſtotles</hi> and <hi>Galens</hi> (which are ſo much
contemned by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and others of his
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:57184:71"/>
Society) as may be ſeen at large in their
writings of the Elements in general, and
each of them in particular.</p>
                  <p>And as to the great <hi>Arcana</hi> of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents,
the <hi>univerſal by diſſolution of Gold,
liquor Alkaheſt, Ferment, grand Elixir, &amp;c.</hi>
there is none of them I preſume, will dare
to pretend to them; they being (as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive)
but bad Commentators upon ſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
and dark a text; it being very well
known to all men that have been conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
in their writings, that they affected an
Aenigmatical and Hieroglyphical ſtile, too
difficult for theſe men to unfold.</p>
                  <p>And therefore they have wiſely conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
themſelves with Authors of a later date
and lower form in Chymiſtry; which had
they well underſtood, they would not have
diſcourſed ſo contemptibly againſt the
fountains of all good and ingenious litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
and education, <hi>viz.</hi> the famous Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities
of our own and foreign Countries;
nor yet have fancied that a few preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſtolen out of <hi>Faber, Horſtius, &amp;c.</hi> ſhould
have merited ſuch a ſplendid title as that of
<hi>Aurora Chymica;</hi> nor that Antimonial or Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial
preparations (the moſt dangerous,
venenate and fatal Medicines, if not wiſely
and faithfully managed both by their Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:57184:72"/>
and thoſe that exhibite them) ſhould
have deſerved the eſtimation of remedies
<hi>extracted by the Solar rayes;</hi> nor that <hi>an
Infuſion of Senna, Elecampane, Liquorice,
Guajacum, Coriander and Anniſe-ſeeds in
Aqua vitae,</hi> ſhould have deſerved the title of
<hi>Elixir Salutis:</hi> nor <hi>a diſſolution of Elaterium,
Jalapp, Gummi gutta,</hi> or the like, <hi>in a
little Brandy, or Spirit of Wine, drawn from
Scurvy-graſs; that of a Golden Purging Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi>
nor yet that theſe Medicines ſhould have
<hi>ſuited all palates and conſtitutions,</hi> as they
knaviſhly pretend.</p>
                  <p>For 'tis no difficulty to prove that none
of theſe Medicines (which they would
gladly have the ignorant vulgar believe
Univerſal) can cure diſeaſes better, nor yet
ſo well, as the Emetick Infuſion which
every Apothecary hath in his ſhop; nor as
the Cathartick pills or potions which our
Diſpenſatory doth ſufficiently furniſh us
withal, and every Novice in our Art may
eaſily preſcribe: but the cures that are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by the forementioned remedies, are
to be attributed to little elſe but the method
of uſing them, which they as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
and ignore as learning it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And therefore that they might maintain
their repute with their ignorant Devotio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57184:72"/>
they have affixed ſeveral monſter-drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſied
titles to their pretended <hi>Arcana;</hi> as <hi>Aqua
Tetra-Chymagogon; Pilulae Anticachecticae, Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis
Catholicus Emetico catharticus, Elixir Lyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponon,
Archei Sedativum &amp; Anodynum, Bezoar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dick</hi>
and <hi>Anti-odontalgick powders fabricated
by Sol</hi> and <hi>Luna; Panpharmacons, &amp;c.</hi> which
occaſions thoſe poor ſilly ſouls to fancy their
Authors a form above Phyſicians, the very
names of their remedies being more likely
to fright or conjure away their diſeaſes than
their medicines.</p>
                  <p>And as for their cures, that are cry'd up
and down the ſtreets in printed Bills, and
patched on every poſt; I take them to be
of as good credit as their Predeceſſor's
<hi>O Dowdes;</hi> of which the ingenious
Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> formerly Operator to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Phyſicians hath given the world
an account. And leſt his teſtimony ſhould
not pleaſe them, or his credit be ſuſpected,
as having ſome dependence upon that learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Colledge; I ſhall acquaint them with
what characters they have lately given each
other in their printed bills; the one charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the other <hi>for an ignorant Dunce that
cannot write three lines of true Engliſh and
ſence; for villany and poyſon,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of the Cures that he pretends to have done
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57184:73"/>
in ſeveral parts of</hi> England, <hi>he will prove
them forged and lies;</hi> the other charging his
Adverſary <hi>for Felony, Burglary and other
miſdemeanors.</hi> And therefore one of the
moſt ingenious of this gang of men, having
formerly <hi>received an account out of ſeveral
of the Counties of</hi> England, <hi>of the apparent,
undeniable, and inexcuſable tragedies that
have been cauſed by taking theſe Empirical
Medicines;</hi> hath told the world in Print,
that <hi>their Univerſal remedies are but dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Venomes;</hi> and <hi>their Authors but ſtupid
and blockiſh Philoſophers; heteroclite pieces
of mortality; as Weavers, Taylors, Botchers,
Coblers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who of late having thrown aſide
their Bodkins and Thimbles, Laſts, Awles,
and Shuttles, are become (Aſini ad Lyram)
like ſo many Apes in a Carpenters work-room, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And leſt Mr. <hi>H.</hi> ſhould be offended with
this relation I have given from ſome of his
Brethrens writings, I will be ſo kind as to
acquaint him with the operation of ſome of
their <hi>famous, wonderful, and never failing
Medicines,</hi> (as they term them) which have
been attended with the following ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is diſcourſed of by Doctor <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
in the firſt part of his <hi>Pharmaceutice ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionalis,
p.</hi> 99. who there gives an account
of the exhibition of two doſes of a Cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:57184:73"/>
powder from an Empirick to two
Boyes; the effect whereof was this, that
in one of them the powder wrought no leſs
than an hundred times in the ſpace of forty
eight hours; the other it neither purged
nor vomited; but in few days his hair
fell off, and nails grew black, and in a
ſhort time aqueous puſtles broke forth in
all the habit of his body, which were ſoon
hardned into cruſty ſcabs, which were of
ſo poyſonous and venenate a nature, that
the poor boy was miſerably afflicted with
them for above two years before any cure
could be obtained; although the moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate
Medicines were not wanting
during that time.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond by Doctor <hi>Caſtle;</hi> who in his
<hi>Chymical Galeniſt</hi> acquaints us, <hi>p.</hi> 22. that
having viſited his learned friend Dr. <hi>Cox,</hi>
he told him that he had been lately called
to a Citizen of <hi>London,</hi> who upon taking a
Vomit from an Empirick, fell into an <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>percatharſis,</hi>
and out of that into diſmal
Convulſions, in which in deſpite of the
moſt proper remedies he dyed.</p>
                  <p>And 'tis not long ſince that my Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary
told me, that one of this Tribe being
ſent for to a poor <hi>Hoſtler</hi> in a Fever, whom
finding after ſome dayes treatment in great
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57184:74"/>
want of reſt; he ſent for a dram of <hi>Opium</hi>
(at leaſt 58 grains too much) with ſome
<hi>Diaſcordium</hi> to give this Fellow inwardly;
which the Apothecary underſtanding, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
to ſupply him with, which cauſed
him to huſſe like one of the Hectors of the
Town, that his learning and skill ſhould
be called in queſtion by an Apothecary,
though it were to ſave a mans life.</p>
                  <p>I could likewiſe acquaint Mr. <hi>H.</hi> with a
Friend and Companion of his, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
his Patient a ſpeedy cure, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
it in good earneſt; the Phyſick he
exhibited, being of ſuch a deleterious,
deadly quality, that its operation was not
only incredibly violent; but in a ſhort time
it found its paſſage into the bloud, and
from thence for ſeveral dayes diſcharged
ſuch large quantities of that noble and vital
liquor; that the poor languiſhing Patient
ſpeedily dyed; notwithſtanding the moſt
rational and proper remedies that were
made uſe of, by a very great and learned
Phyſician to have prevented his death.</p>
                  <p>And if Mr. <hi>H.</hi> were as good at an appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
as I find him at a falſe quotation;
I could tell him of a man <hi>that ſerved ſeven
years with an Apothecary, and travelled into</hi>
Holland, Germany, France <hi>and</hi> Spain;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57184:74"/>
and thus ſpent eight and thirty years in laborious
pains and travels to gain experience and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
in Phyſick above the common ſort, and
to look into the practiſe of the beſt Phyſicians
and Artiſts of diverſe Nations; and then
<hi>coming into</hi> England <hi>well furniſhed with
a Celeſtial liquor, and other remedies which
himſelf and Patients might depend upon;</hi>
very confidently undertook the Cure of a
Gentleman that had for a year or two la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured
under a pertinacious Jaundice and
inveterate Dropſie (though given over by
the moſt eminent and learned Phyſicians
of our Age) promiſing to carry off the
diſeaſe without any evacuating reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies;
yet after a weeks uſe of his <hi>Arcana,</hi>
the Patient fell into violent Vomitings
and dejections downwards, ſuffering forty
or more evacuations in a ſhort ſpace; which
giving ſome preſent relief, encouraged the
Patient to continue the uſe of this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans
Phyſick; which after a week or ten
dayes time, procuring ſuch another eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuating
paroxyſm, it very unfortunately
proved ſo high and fatal to the Patient,
that he dyed in the Operation; the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
<hi>by Certificate</hi> giving hopes of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
to the laſt moment of his life. Now
ſurely Mr. <hi>H.</hi> had this Traveller been as
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:57184:75"/>
ſtudious in his enquiries into the nature
and cauſes of the forementioned diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
as he hath been into Chymical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations;
he would not have exhibited
thoſe medicines ſo fortuitouſly; nor yet
have paſſed a prognoſtick ſo ignorantly.</p>
                  <p>And to conclude, I will at preſent trouble
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> but with one ſtory more of this
friend of his; and that was of his exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of another of his <hi>effectual remedies</hi> to
a young Virgin, which unexpectedly (as
I preſume) having the fortune of raiſing
ſome ſlight Salivation, he ordered her to
ſwallow her Spittle, which ſpeedily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
ſuch Symptoms, that both the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
of the Child and the learned Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
that were afterwards ſent for, did
both judge her poyſoned by the medicines
exhibited; which proved ſo indeed; for
in a very ſhort ſpace ſhe dyed thereby.</p>
                  <p>Now ſurely, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> had the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
perſon been half ſo good a Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
or Phyſician as the learned Dr. <hi>Wither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi>
or Dr. <hi>Hodges,</hi> whom he is pleaſed to
call <hi>Novices;</hi> (although the former is a
perſon of thoſe excellent accompliſhments
in his Faculty, that his reputation is great
with moſt perſons of Quality in this famous
City; and is Phyſician to his Majeſties
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57184:75"/>
own perſon; the later a perſon, to
whom poſterity will own themſelves
endebted, for leaving behind him ſo full
and complete a Hiſtory of the late direful
<hi>London</hi> Plague) he would have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood,
that when Mercurial or other mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
preparations had put the bloud into a
<hi>fluor,</hi> and impregnated it with ſowre and
Vitriolick parts, it muſt needs be very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
to ſwallow that <hi>ſaliva</hi> down, which
would not only injure the Tone of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,
Inteſtines and other <hi>viſcera,</hi> but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy
the native temper of the bloud, Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
ſpirits and all the other noble juices of
the body.</p>
                  <p>And that, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> this dearly beloved
friend of yours, may not for the future by
ſuch unjuſtifiable <hi>Arcana,</hi> ruine the lives
and health of any more of his Patients in
this kind, I will acquaint him with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
obſervation; which was of a poor
ſilly Dog, who unfortunately lapping up
a quantity of <hi>ſaliva</hi> in a Patients chamber
of mine that was Salivated; immediately
forſook his victuals, grew languid and
weak, pining away to skin and bones, and
in a ſhort time dyed.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed according to my former
promiſe; I ſhall now endeavour to prove
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:57184:76"/>
that what advancement hath accrewed to
this noble Art of Chymiſtry, did never
own its original to theſe Adverſaries of
ours, or any of their Predeceſſors; but to
Phyſicians of Academick education and
Collegiate members.</p>
                  <p>Which certainly is ſo far from a diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty
to undertake; that whoever hath
been acquainted with the learned writings
of <hi>Mynſicht, Crollius, Faber Beguinus, Hartman,
Grulingius, Horſtius, Schroderus, Querce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
Zwelfer, Becherus, Langelott, Borri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,
&amp;c.</hi> (moſt of which men I hope
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will own to have been better vers'd
in Chymiſtry than himſelf or any of his
Companions) will give me their aſſent
to ſo great a truth; which any ingenious
perſon may be ſatisfied in, who pleaſeth to
peruſe the forementioned Authors; but
more eſpecially the admirable <hi>Pharmaco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poeas</hi>
of the learned <hi>Quercetan</hi> and <hi>Zwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer;</hi>
the one having acquainted the world
with the great improvements, that may
be made in the medicinal part of Phyſick
by Chymical Pharmacy; the other no leſs
judiciouſly correcting the errors of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<hi>Pharmacopoeias;</hi> and ſubſtituting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
that might anſwer the ſame inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
the Authors expected from their
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:57184:76"/>
former compoſitions, but much more effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciouſly.</p>
                  <p>And ſurely he that reads, how learnedly
the great <hi>Borrichius</hi> hath defended this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
Art againſt <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nringius;</hi> will not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
admire what he hath written upon that
ſubject, but expect ſomething great in
Chymiſtry from that learned man. And
for the famous <hi>Langelott,</hi> there is none who
hath been acquainted with the admirable
remedies he hath already diſcovered, but
muſt acknowledge that he hath been very
converſant with Nature even in her greateſt
ſecrets. And he that hath read over the
famous <hi>Becherus</hi> his <hi>Phyſica ſubterranea,</hi>
will ſcarcely ſcruple to allow us, what vaſt
improvements have been already made
from theſe true Adepts of Nature;
who having divulged to the world the
great familiarity they already enjoy in her
palace, what may be expected from them,
when they come to be admitted as part of
her Cabinet Counſel?</p>
                  <p>Now good Mr. <hi>H.</hi> do you or any of your
friends give us parallel inſtances of the like
improvements that have been made by any
of your Society in this Art we contend
about, and we will ingenuouſly give them
their due; but for my own part I profeſs
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:57184:77"/>
that I know not of any, neither do I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that ſuch inſtances can be produced,
and then what little reaſon hath Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to
glory of <hi>that great ſpirit that is now up and
at work for further and further improvement
amongſt the working Phyſicians,</hi> as he terms
thoſe of his own fraternity?</p>
                  <p>And though he hath taken the pains to
tranſcribe that thred bare ſtory of <hi>Querce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
and Sir <hi>Theodore Mayerne</hi> out of that
<hi>unanſwerable</hi> book (as he ignorantly calls
it, having I perceive never peruſed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
to it) <hi>Medela Medicinae, in perpetuum
rei ſcandalum,</hi> as his friend would have the
world believe; yet how little to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
you may obſerve by the following
account.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In</hi> p. 23. <hi>he tells us that in the year</hi>
1603. the laborious famous <hi>Quercetan</hi> and
Sir <hi>Theodore de Mayerne,</hi> were both of them
in two ſeveral publick Sentences of the Academi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Profeſſors, and whole Colledge of Phyſicians
in <hi>Paris,</hi> printed by their order, condemned,
(and in poſitive terms the whole Art it ſelf
of Chymiſtry) as men not only unworthy to be
conſulted with by the Phyſicians of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
eſpecially <hi>Mayerne,</hi> declaring him an
unlearned, impudent, drunken mad fellow;
exhorting all Nations to abominate them both,
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:57184:77"/>
and baniſh them and the like practiſers out of
their Territories, as Monſters of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind:
and threatning all the Fellows of
that Colledge, that if they did conſult with
either of them about any Patient, they ſhould
be deprived of all priviledge belonging to
their Colledge.</p>
                  <p>Well quoted Mr. <hi>H!</hi> had you known
when you had done well, you would have
proceeded no farther in this relation, but I
perceive you were near the pitch of one
and thirty when you tranſcribed this ſtory,
and then unfortunately all came out, for
<hi>Children, &amp;c.</hi>—witneſs what follows in
the very ſame page where he tells us;</p>
                  <p>That for all this, the one of thoſe condemned
perſons became famous in <hi>France,</hi> the Kings
chief Phyſician, and lived to ſee that Colledge
repent of their folly, and their ſucceſſors
become admirers of thoſe Chymical books and
remedies which they had ſo raſhly damned.
The other (viz. <hi>Mayerne)</hi> became Phyſician
to two Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and two of <hi>France,</hi>
and left a name of great wealth and honour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
him.</p>
                  <p>To this ſtory of your friend's <hi>M. N.</hi> which
I have obſerved twice quoted by himſelf,
and once by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> I might return this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer;
that Chymiſtry was then in its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:57184:78"/>
in <hi>France,</hi> and therefore no wonder
that it met with ſuch oppoſition even
from a learned Society; ſeeing it was not
the fate of that Art alone to meet with ſo
ill and unjuſt entertainment: For Anatomy
it ſelf (which is ſo much <hi>damn'd</hi> and hector'd
againſt by you and your companions) hath
born its ſhare in that kind; witneſs that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
ſtory of <hi>Democritus,</hi> who was
eſteemed no better than a mad man by the
Senate and people where he lived, for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding
himſelf from company to inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
the nature and uſe of the <hi>bilis;</hi> which
occaſioned the great <hi>Hippocrates</hi> by requeſt of
the Senate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to come a perilous &amp; trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
voyage by Sea, to undertake his cure;
who finding him diligently employed in
the diſſection of Animals; he commended
his induſtry, admired his wiſdom, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed
his friends of madneſs in their cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures:
which madneſs how much it hath
poſſeſſed Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and the Pſeudo-Chymiſts
of our Age, I will leave to the judgment of
any judicious perſon, who hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant
in their writings.</p>
                  <p>And leſt this they ſhould think the only
caſe we can produce, I could tell them of
the unkind uſage and ill treatment that our
immortal Doctor <hi>Harvey</hi> met with; for
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:57184:78"/>
that great invention of his, the circulation
of the bloud; for which poſterity will
both admire and bleſs him.</p>
                  <p>And if there were need, I might tell
him of many more; but though I ſhould,
I fear it would be to little purpoſe; for his
and his Brethrens ignorance and confidence
do make them more irreconcileable to Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy,
than the Colledge of <hi>Paris</hi> ever was
to the learned <hi>Quercetan</hi> and famous
<hi>Mayern.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to proceed in giving Mr. <hi>H.</hi> a cloſer
anſwer; I now would gladly know of him,
how much this ſtory is quoted to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
and what it is that he hath ſo wiſely
collected from it? For let any judicious man
read it, and he may plainly obſerve that the
perſons that were thus ſeverely <hi>damned</hi> (as
he terms it) were not Empiricks, but
Doctors of Phyſick, men of Academick
education; great Philoſophers and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts,
(which in Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and our Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
opinions could make them no better,
than <hi>idle and formal Speculators, Academian
Thinkers, Medicaſters</hi> and <hi>talking Book-Doctors,)</hi>
only they lived in an age, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
other Phyſicians education and practiſe
had too much prejudiced them againſt the
noble Art of Chymiſtry; which prejudice
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:57184:79"/>
(it ſeems) by Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s own confeſſion was
not ſo great, but <hi>they lived to repent of their
folly; and their ſucceſſors became admirers
of thoſe Chymical books and remedies.</hi> 'Tis
well then, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> I perceive the Colledge
of <hi>Paris</hi> is now in your favour; for by your
own quotation and confeſſion, they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<hi>admirers of thoſe books and medicines
they formerly damned:</hi> This paſſage I
muſt own did ſo much pleaſe me when I
read it, that I was in ſome hopes to have
found the Colledge of <hi>London</hi> received into
favour in the next page; but no ſuch matter,
the man forgetful of what he had quoted
but in the page before about the Colledge
of <hi>Paris,</hi> tells us quite another tale, <hi>viz.
that Corporations of Phyſick have been the
great hinderers of the progreſs of this Art
throughout</hi> Europe, <hi>and ſtill are:</hi> well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
Mr. <hi>H!</hi> but what teſtimony have
we for this ſo bold and confident an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
the chief that I can find is this, that
the Colledge of <hi>Paris</hi> did damn two learned
men, and ſoundly repented for their pains;
which repentance was ſo ſerious that it left
ſuch an impreſſion upon their poſterity,
that they admired (as I before mentioned)
both the <hi>men and their remedies,</hi> which <hi>their
Predeceſſors ſo raſhly</hi> condemned; and yet
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:57184:79"/>
they muſt be quoted upon every occaſion
as enemies to this <hi>Art of Chymiſtry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But not withſtanding theſe contradictions,
which ought to be allowed to a man that
makes ſo little of Academick learning;
pray what is all this Harangue to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Phyſicians in <hi>London?</hi> eſpecially
ſeeing 'tis ſo well known, that the famous
Sir <hi>Theodore de Mayerne</hi> was ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an Adverſary to <hi>Corporations of Phyſick,</hi>
that he was a member of this learned So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, I ſhall further endeavour
to clear the truth of my aſſertion; and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> diſcovers ſo much anger againſt
the Colledge of <hi>Paris,</hi> I will acquaint him
out of one of their own Countrey mens
writings and an eminent Chymiſt too, <hi>Le
Febure, lately Royal Profeſſor to His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of</hi> England, <hi>and Apothecary in Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
to his Honourable Houſhold, and Fellow of
the Royal Society;</hi> what improvements have
been made in this Art by men of Academick
education in <hi>France,</hi> and thoſe whom I
preſume might be of their Colledge too.</p>
                  <p>And in the firſt place he tells us, that <hi>Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
are the fountains from whence all firſt
receive the noble knowledge of true Natural
things, and the manner of preparing them
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:57184:80"/>
well</hi> And that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> may be aſſured that
he intended not by the name Phyſicians,
any of his Tribe; that like not (as he
terms it) <hi>that Feather in the Cap;</hi> he doth
particularly and ingenuouſly acknowledge
his obligations to thoſe learned men, to
whom he was ſo much endebted for his
attainmens in <hi>Chymical pharmacy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The one was, Dr.</hi> Duhan Doctor of
Phyſick and Profeſſor of Philoſophy, who
promoted him much in his diligent ſearching
into phyſical verities; <hi>yea ſo eminent was
this Doctor in his knowledge in Chymiſtry,
that he tells you,</hi> that <hi>France</hi> ſuffered much
by his untimely death, he deſigning to publiſh
ſome writings, that would have much illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated
the knowledge of things natural, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
and Pharmacy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The ſecond was</hi> M. du Clos Doctor of
Phyſick, who did him the favour <hi>(as he
frankly and ingenuouſly acknowledgeth)</hi>
to correct his defaults, and lead him by the
hand of his judgment and experience, through
all that which he had undertaken in his endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours;
to advance the dignity of Pharmacy,
which now <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> lies bending towards
its ruines; if it be not upheld by its true Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
and pillars; the faithful, learned, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced
and curious Phyſicians; <hi>nay far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:57184:80"/>
he confeſſeth,</hi> that he was endebted
to this Doctor for the well-being he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
in his Profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The third was,</hi> Monſ. Vallot, chief Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
to the preſent King of <hi>France,</hi> from
whoſe unfathomed depths of learning and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience
he yet obtained farther light and
knowledge in this Art: <hi>So that he owns
him,</hi> for the true Father and Reſtorer of
Medicine and Chymiſtry, <hi>and tells us,</hi> that
he could not do leſs than to let poſterity know,
how much he ſtood endebted to the bounty, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and ſole generoſity of this great and illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Mecaenas.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And to conclude, he frankly tells the world,
in that excellent Book of his, called his</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
Body of Chymiſtry; <hi>that</hi> he hath given
nothing therein, but what hath been received
from Phyſicians, ſo that 'tis to them only to
whom you owe the obligation.</p>
                  <p>But to come nearer home, let me tell
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> that this is not all the evidence that
I can produce for the proof of my aſſertion;
for 'tis very well known that the lately
mentioned Sir <hi>Theodore Mayerne</hi> and
old Doctor <hi>Rugeley</hi> were members of the
Colledge of Phyſicians, and perſons ſo emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently
skilled in this Art we conteſt about,
that I doubt not but our Adverſaries them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57184:81"/>
will allow us their ſuffrage to the
truth thereof: And ſo far was that learned
Colledge from diſcouraging Chymiſtry in
thoſe early dayes, that 'tis very well known,
they had a conſtant Operator employed by
them.</p>
                  <p>And for our own time, who is ignorant
of the great abilities of ſeveral of the
members of that worthy Society? witneſs
the excellent Dr. <hi>Rugely,</hi> Dr. <hi>Jonathan God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard</hi>
(who lately dyed) Dr. <hi>Merret, &amp;c.</hi> the
firſt of which eminent Phyſicians, is not
only a Gentleman of univerſal learning
and accompliſhments both of body and
mind; but of that profound inſight into
the Art of Chymiſtry, that were Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s
beloved <hi>Helmont</hi> now alive, he could give
him no leſs character than I have done.</p>
                  <p>I might farther mention ſeveral other
members of that worthy Society, and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity
Phyſicians too, whoſe private Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratories,
and continued pains that have
been ſpent in them, for the publick good,
and particular benefit of their Patients;
might make theſe men aſhamed (if they
had any ingenuity left them) to pretend
that <hi>they are, and have been the great hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers
of the progreſs of this Art throughout</hi>
Europe: which is ſo notoriouſly falſe, that
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57184:81"/>
I ſhall crave leave to acquaint them with
what improvements have been made in
Chymiſtry, by one more of the late Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
of that learned Colledge, and that
was the excellent Doctor <hi>Willis,</hi> who
was likewiſe <hi>Profeſſor of Natural Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy
in the famous Univerſity of</hi> Oxford,
<hi>and Fellow of the Royal Society in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi>
who hath not only ingenuouſly
communicated many good medicines,
which are ſcattered up and down his works;
but was maſter of greater <hi>Arcana</hi> in Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry,
than any our Adverſaries can rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
pretend to; which any rational
man will grant me, that ſeriouſly and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deratively
readeth over that incomparable
book of his <hi>de Febribus,</hi> and eſpecially the
firſt part of it <hi>de fermentatione.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where he hath moſt judiciouſly and
learnedly acquainted all ingenious Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
and Naturaliſts, with the reaſons that
prevailed with him, to imbrace the Spagy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
principles, for the explication of all
the difficult <hi>phaenomena</hi> in Nature, as well
as in humane bodies; and very learnedly
demonſtrated their true exiſtence; which
having done, he gives us an admirable ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the great alterations that are made
in the works of Nature and Art, <hi>viz.</hi> in
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57184:82"/>
the Animal, Vegetable, and Mineral king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms,
from the inteſtine combination and
motion, ſeparation and diſſolution of theſe
active principles.</p>
                  <p>And in the ninth Chapter of that Tract,
he hath furniſhed us with ſuch a learned
and ſatisfactory account of the ſeveral <hi>men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrua</hi>
that are moſt proper, for the ſolution
of all natural bodies; whoſe <hi>vinculum</hi> doth
chiefly conſiſt in Sulphureous, Saline or
Terreſtrial parts; that none who readeth
him, but muſt admire him for an acute
Philoſopher, as well as a profound Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt:
for the knowledge of theſe doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
accompliſh a Phyſician for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
of Chymical Pharmacy; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
if we add hereto a full underſtanding
of the true nature of Fermentation, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion
and Circulation, which our Author
was no ſtranger to.</p>
                  <p>And truly I may be bold to ſay that we
may expect far greater attainments in this
Art from him, that throughly underſtands
the forementioned operations, than from
the whole Club of our <hi>London</hi> Empiricks;
who generally are ignorant, not only of the
conſtitutive principles of thoſe Bodies, they
would pretend to analyſe; but likewiſe of
their proper Solvents.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:57184:82"/>
                     <hi>And therefore the learned Doctor</hi> Willis
<hi>juſt before mentioned, hath well acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
us in his Epiſtle to that admirable book
of his, which he calls, his</hi> Pharmaceutice
rationalis, <hi>what we may expect from this
ſort of men, where he tells us;</hi> Dum mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralia
inſcitè tractant, eventum quendam in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certum
expectantes, potius quàm aliquid ſeriò
deſignantes; ſi forſan productum inſolitum ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paruerit,
cum novo hoc Pharmaco (cujus
virtutes prorſus ignotae, ſaepe aut nullae aut
maleficae exiſtunt) morbos ſtatim omnes ſana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turos
pollicentur, ipſúmque in quovis caſu ad
magnam aegrotantis noxam &amp; non rarò perniciem
audacter exhibent: adeò ſecurè &amp; temerariè
ſolent carnifices iſti de corio humano ludere,
dum ad medicamenta iſta (in quibus aculeus
ſemper latet venenoſus) aut paranda, aut ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibenda
nullo conſilio, nulliúsque methodi filo,
ſed mero caſu &amp; caeco quodam impetu ducun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur:
<hi>i. e.</hi> Whilſt they unskilfully handle mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals,
rather expecting an uncertain event,
than proſecuting any ſerious deſign; if by
chance any unuſual product doth appear, they
ſtraightway promiſe the cure of all diſeaſes
from that new Medicine; whoſe vertues are
altogether unknown; or it may be pernicious,
or none at all; and this they boldly exhibite
in any caſe to the great injury of the Patient,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:57184:83"/>
nay it may be to his utter ruine; ſo raſhly and
confidently do theſe Butchers of mankind ſport
away the precious lives of men, whilſt they
adventure upon the preparation and exhibition
of ſuch medicines as theſe (in which there is
conſtantly latent ſome venemous ſting) not
being directed thereto by any advice or me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
but meerly driven on by chance and blind
raſhneſs.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed in a farther account of our
excellent Authors attainments in Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſtry,
which we may find, if we will
take the pains to peruſe the ſecond part of
the forementioned book, which treateth <hi>de
febribus,</hi> and the third <hi>de urinis;</hi> where he
hath given us an incomparable account of
the conſtituent principles both of humane
blood, and urine; from whence he hath
rationally and ingeniouſly deduced ſuch uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Hypotheſes, for the explication of the
<hi>phaenomena</hi> of both, in a natural and preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
ſtate; that no Age can paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And though ſome boaſting Empiricks,
have pretended a confutation of his learned
writings in the title pages of their ſcurrilous
books; yet to how little purpoſe, any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
perſon may be ſatisfied, who is
willing for his curioſity to loſe ſo much
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57184:83"/>
precious time as to read them over: And
therefore our learned Author did very pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
return them no other anſwer but the
following (the moſt proper that could be
contrived for thoſe Adverſaries of his,
whoſe writings were ſtuffed with little elſe
but</hi> Billingſgate <hi>language)</hi> Quandoquidem
Empirici nonnulli, arreptâ tam quidlibet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pune
ſcribendi, quàm ludendi de corio humano
licentiâ; placita mea, quae non ſatis intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunt,

quò ſpecioſiùs merces ſuas venditent, libello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

utpote quorum ſcripta &amp; reſponſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digna

illos aeſtimo, qui argumentorum loco, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tùm
opprobria &amp; convitia ingerentes, debaccha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri
potius quàm Philoſophari videntur. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
ſome Empiricks having taken the liberty
of writing any thing, as well as dallying with
the lives of men, do rudely treat thoſe opinions
of mine, which they do not well underſtand;
and that their books might more ſpeciouſly ſell,
they carry me in Triumph in their title pages:
But to theſe men I ſhall return no other anſwer
but ſilence and contempt; whoſe writings are
not worthy of a better, and being contemned
will vaniſh of themſelves and be forgotten:
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:57184:84"/>
neither have I greater eſtimation for thoſe men,
who do rather rage and rail like mad and drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
ſotts; than reaſon like Philoſophers, prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
little elſe but ill language and revilings.</p>
                  <p>But it may be Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will not yet allow
me (notwithſtanding this ſo clear demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration
which I have given of the ſurpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
abilities of this learned man) that
he was ſo great a Proficient in the Spagyri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Art as himſelf, or ſome of his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
would pretend to be:</p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> that I ſhould produce
a greater and truer evidence, for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation
of this aſſertion, out of that <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable
book of your friend's, Doctor</hi> Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chamont
Nedhams, <hi>which you at large have
told us</hi> p. 23. <hi>was written eleven years ago;</hi>
than you have produced out of the honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> againſt Anatomy, and that
without everting the deſign of the Author
or a falſe quotation; would this be a means
to ſilence your confidence for the future,
and make you more wary in railing againſt
Academick education and Collegiate mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers?
I confeſs one would think it ſhould;
and therefore out of reſpect and kindneſs to
you, for ſome real favours that you have
formerly done to ſome deſerving perſons;
I ſhall deſire you to read over the beginning
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57184:84"/>
of <hi>p.</hi> 237. of that book called <hi>Medela Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinae,</hi>
where you will find, that your <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable</hi>
friend having told the world in
the latter part of the page preceeding, <hi>that
all along that Treatiſe, he had ſaid little but
what was in the language of the beſt writers
of this latter Age, or agreeable to their ſenſe;</hi>
he there <hi>craves leave to make uſe of one, who is
(I may well ſay) <hi>the Ornament of our
Nation</hi> next to immortal</hi> Harvey, <hi>by name
Doctor</hi> Willis, <hi>Profeſſor of Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
in the Univerſity of</hi> Oxon; <hi>one that
hath made himſelf a <hi>Phyſician indeed,
and Philoſopher by Fire.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And in</hi> p. 336. <hi>he tells you, that</hi> he thought
it neceſſary to give the Reader a taſte of Doctor
<hi>Willis</hi> his new Doctrine about Urines, which
certainly <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> is <hi>much more agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to reaſon</hi> than any thing that was ever
ſaid before upon that ſubject, and muſt needs
be <hi>abundantly more conducible to the
practiſe of Phyſick;</hi> ſeeing it directs our
judgment not by meer outward appearances
and bare obſervations of old; but by an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation
of our underſtandings in the
<hi>real principles</hi> which are in Urines, <hi>the
ſame as in mens bodies;</hi> from whence
doubtleſs a more certain way of judgment muſt
needs ariſe, than can be imagined by any
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57184:85"/>
other courſe that may be taken to judge by
Urines, <hi>concerning the ſtate of the blood
and its diſeaſes.</hi> I cannot therefore but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
that Tract of Urines to ingenious
Practiſers, as a more ſure guide than any that
they can meet with in former Authors.</p>
                  <p>And in <hi>p.</hi> 415. of the ſame book he
owneth, that this learned Doctor <hi>had the
honour of opening the eyes of the world, more
than any before him</hi> (his acute <hi>Helmont</hi> not
excepted) <hi>about <hi>the nature of Fevers.</hi>
                     </hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now pray, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> let me perſwade you
to take the pains ſeriouſly to peruſe and
conſider theſe paſſages faithfully quoted
out of your <hi>unanſwerable book,</hi> and then let
us underſtand the reaſon, why you made
ſo bold a challenge, and that <hi>in the view of
the world,</hi> to the whole Colledge of Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians,
as to <hi>nominate any one particular of
improvement that their Society have made in
the Art of Curing ſince their firſt incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
&amp;c.</hi> ſeeing that your ingenious friend
in that very book you quoted as <hi>unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi>
hath told the world that Dr. <hi>Willis</hi>
did underſtand the nature of <hi>Fevers more
than any before him,</hi> and conſequently
the Cure: nay further (as I juſt before
quoted) he frankly owneth, that the
Doctors <hi>principles about Urines were the
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57184:85"/>
ſame as in mens bodies, which muſt needs be
abundantly more conducible to the practiſe of
Phyſick, and to judge of the ſtate of the blood and
its diſeaſes,</hi> than any that were formerly
delivered.</p>
                  <p>Now certainly, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> thoſe doctrines
which can acquaint us, with the real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent
principles of the blood, and other
humors and recrements of humane bodies,
with their various preternatural affections,
muſt of neceſſity tend to <hi>one particular im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,
and be abundantly conducible to the
practiſe of Phyſick;</hi> which you by no means
will allow the Colledge ſince <hi>their firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporation,</hi>
but will undertake to <hi>prove the
contrary,</hi> as you have boldly aſſerted, <hi>p.</hi> 15.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> by the account you
have given of your travels, and your
quacking Avocations; I may juſtly ſuſpect
that you have not had time to ſearch into
all that hath been written by the learned
members of that Honourable Society; I
will be ſo ingenuous for the preſent, as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint
you with another <hi>particular of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement,</hi>
that was made in the <hi>Art of curing,</hi>
by the learned Doctor <hi>Gliſſon,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bates,</hi>
and Doctor <hi>Regemorter;</hi> and that was the
<hi>Rickets,</hi> a diſeaſe altogether unknown to
the Ancients; it being the Endemial
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:57184:86"/>
diſtemper of our own Nation. And if
there were need, I could mention ſeveral
other <hi>improvements in this Art,</hi> which
have been made by this learned Society,
but that Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s deſiring <hi>an inſtance but of
one,</hi> hath prevented my diſcourſing any
further at preſent on this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But to proceed, Mr.</hi> H. <hi>tells us,</hi> p. 28. <hi>of</hi>
ingenious men that were not educated in a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiate
way, who afterwards betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to learn the Art of Phyſick in the moſt
proper way, which is by labour; have ſoon
outſtript the Scholaſticks in right knowledge
of the <hi>materia medica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> had done
well, if he had acquainted us with thoſe
ingenious men, who <hi>by their labour have
outſtript the Scholaſticks in right knowledge of
the</hi> materia medica, for we know very
well that <hi>dolus verſatur in univerſalibus:</hi>
and farther give me leave to tell him, that
I am not of his belief, that manual opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
alone will fit any man, (much leſs
thoſe of his mechanical Tribe) for any
great improvement in the <hi>materia medica;</hi>
it being very well known, that no perſon
is truly capable of performing any thing
great in Chymical pharmacy, who is ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of the conſtituent principles of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:57184:86"/>
thoſe bodies he operates upon, or of thoſe
to whom his remedies are to be exhibited;
and therefore it was one of the chief deſigns
of that noble Author Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> in that
Treatiſe of his, ſo often mentioned, the
<hi>uſefulneſs of Experimental Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi>
to ſhew, how much the Naturaliſts
knowledge might be ſerviceable to him, in
the improvement of all the parts of Phyſick,
and more eſpecially the Pharmaceutical:
and ſurely if <hi>labour be the moſt proper way</hi>
to advance this Art, the Smiths, Brewers
and Colliers may be greater Proficients
therein, than Mr. <hi>H.</hi> or the moſt learned
of his companions; for 'tis certain, they are
much more able by labour and pains to
obtain it: but the contrary is manifeſt, by
the writings of the learned <hi>Quercetan,
Zwelfer</hi> and other eminent Chymiſts, who
had never been capable of doing half that
ſervice in Pharmacy, for which the world
is ſo much endebted to them; had they not
been as great Philoſophers, as they were
Operators. And therefore that excellent
Chymiſt <hi>Le Febure</hi> hath well obſerved the
two following maxims.</p>
                  <p>1. That Chymiſtry doth not meerly conſiſt
in the skill of preparing well a remedy, as
many do erroneouſly imagine; but in the uſing
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:57184:87"/>
of it with due circumſtances, and reſpect to
the Theorems of Art, which is properly the
true Phyſick.</p>
                  <p>2. That whoſoever meddles with Chymical
remedies, without the previous grounds of
Theory, can deſerve no other name than of an
Empirick; ſince he is altogether ignorant of
the internal efficient cauſes of their effects,
and cannot give the phyſical reaſons, why he
doth adminiſter ſuch a remedy for ſuch and ſuch
diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>And further I can acquaint Mr. <hi>H.</hi> with
ſeveral of the members of the Colledge of
Phyſicians now living, who for their ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
and rational preſcriptions, and true
knowledge of the <hi>materia medica,</hi> do not
only excel Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and all his Society; but
are highly honoured for their admirable and
ſurpaſſing improvements therein, by all of
their own Faculty; as witneſs the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
Dr. <hi>Thomas Cox,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wolf, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And though Mr.</hi> H. <hi>is pleaſed to tell us,</hi>
p. 20. that remedies well prepared by Chymi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Art, ſeem to be as the hands of God reached
down from heaven in this latter age, in exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
mercy to poor man, when his iniquities
have ſo altered the whole ſcene of diſeaſes, &amp;c.
which makes them exceedingly different from
what they were in the dayes of <hi>Hippocrates</hi>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:57184:87"/>
and <hi>Galen,</hi> and indeed from what they were
a hundred years ago, and leſs; ſo that the old
Art and remedies are inſufficient to deal
with them.</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, that in my opinion
Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s Divinity is as heterodox as his Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
hath been; for 'tis a little odd to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
that the iniquities of men ſhould have
been the procuring cauſes of <hi>exceeding mercy;</hi>
I do therefore very much fear, that Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
hath been as great a ſtranger to his Bible as
he hath been to Philoſophy; elſe he might
have obſerved, and that without the help
of Spectacles, that all the judgments that
God Almighty hath inflicted upon <hi>poor man,</hi>
have been procured by his ſins; amongſt
the number of which Judgments Mr. <hi>H.</hi>
might well have ranked his Chymical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
which have proved ſo indeed to
ſome that have made uſe of them; as I
have lately mention'd; and then I am ſure
they can procure but little commendation
to his Art.</p>
                  <p>And as for his diſcourſe of the great alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of diſeaſes ſince <hi>Hippocrates and Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lens
time,</hi> from whence he would prove
that the <hi>old Art and remedies are altogether in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient;</hi>
let me tell him, that there are
ſo full and ſatisfactory Anſwers given to his
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:57184:88"/>
friend upon that ſubject, that I ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure
thoſe learned men, ſhould I now dwell
or inſiſt long upon that controverſie; and
therefore I ſhall recommend to his peruſal
thoſe four books which were written
againſt his friend's <hi>Medela medicinae <hi>ten
or eleven years agone:</hi>
                     </hi> only by the by
let me tell him, that 'tis poſſible that the
<hi>old Art and remedies may be</hi> ſufficient <hi>to deal
with the diſeaſes of our dayes, though much
altered from thoſe in former times;</hi> but that
'tis Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s and the reſt of his Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
misfortune, that they underſtand not
how to exhibite them, being ſo great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners
of a rational methodical practiſe;
by which I muſt frankly own, that I have
ſeen far greater cures performed with Chic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken-broth,
Whey, Milk and Water, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
than by all their applauded Chymical <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And further for that <hi>alteration of diſeaſes</hi>
they diſcourſe of; I could tell them of a
Phyſician of the learned Colledge they ſo
much decry; who hath done more ſervice
to the publick in acquainting the world
with a faithful Hiſtory of the Acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes
of our dayes, with their ſpecifical dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences,
and happy cures, by the old re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies,
they ſo much <hi>damn;</hi> than they
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:57184:88"/>
or any of their Predeceſſors have done by
all their books that ever they printed, or
medicines they publiſhed. And though we
may allow, that the Theories of Fevers and
other diſtempers may poſſibly of late, by the
induſtry of Collegiate members, have been
built upon more ſolid foundations, than for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly;
yet this is ſo far from occaſioning
us to reject the good old remedies and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
of practiſe, that Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> hath
well obſerved, <hi>Quod indicationes quaedam,
antiquitus receptae, adhuc ratae perſtant, erúnt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
in perpetuum obſervandae; quia Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiae
primae hujus artis magiſtrae debentur:
that ſome indications that were of old received,
are yet approved, and will for ever be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
becauſe they owe their original to experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
the firſt miſtreſs of Art.</hi> And to the ſame
purpoſe, he diſcourſeth of the remedies
that were uſed by the Ancients, and no
leſs valued by the Moderns.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And no leſs ingeniouſly did the learned
Doctor</hi> Caſtle <hi>acquaint the world in the
Epiſtle to his Chymical Galeniſt, where
he ſolidly and rationally aſſerts, that</hi> the
practical part of Phyſick being grounded upon
experience, doth not ſo much depend upon the
notional; that, this being overthrown, the
other muſt neceſſarily fall to the ground, the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:57184:89"/>
Fancies and reaſonings of Philoſophers and
Phyſicians being built upon the practice;
and ſignifying not much more to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentals
of the Art of Phyſick, than pinnacles
to the body and foundation of a building, which
(though they be blown down) may ſtand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaken:
much of the Therapeutick part of
Phyſick <hi>being (as he hath well obſerved)</hi>
like Dials and Almanacks, which agree as
well with that of <hi>Copernicus,</hi> as <hi>Ptolomy</hi>'s
Hypotheſis: <hi>Therefore ſaith he,</hi> as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients
made a true uſe of the light and heat
of the Sun, in diſtinguiſhing and meaſuring
times and ſeaſons, and managing of their
husbandry, though probably they err'd in
their notion of his motion round the earth;
ſo did the Phyſi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ians no leſs happily imploy
<hi>Apollo</hi>'s Art in the Curing of diſeaſes, though
they were ignorant of the true motion of the
bloud, and of (the Sun of the Microcoſm)
the heart.</p>
                  <p>But to conclude this diſcourſe about
Chymiſtry; I would gladly know of
Mr. <hi>H.</hi> why the <hi>Chymical mineral medica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ſet down in the</hi> London <hi>Pharmacopoeia,</hi>
are <hi>things but of the loweſt form in Chymiſtry,
and neglected by knowing men in this Age
of improvement?</hi> And that becauſe I find
upon a ſerious peruſal of them, that the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:57184:89"/>
learned <hi>Quercetan</hi> and Sir <hi>Theodore Mayerne</hi>
(whom you will own I hope as moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
Chymiſts) have been the Authors,
Approvers and Defenders of ſome of them,
and have raiſed ſo great a reputation to
their names by their ſucceſsful adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that they both became eminently
famous in our own and foreign Courts
and Cities: but now it ſeems, <hi>they are
neglected by knowing men in this Age of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement;</hi>
I confeſs, I ſhould be very
thankful to Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to acquaint us with
thoſe <hi>knowing men</hi> he boaſts of; and of
their great <hi>improvements</hi> in Chymical phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy;
for let me tell him, how contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptibly
ſoever he and his companions do
think of the <hi>London Diſpenſatory;</hi> the
beſt Chymiſts of them all, would be at a
great loſs for a key to open moſt mineral
bodies, if they ſhould exclude their proper
ſolvents which are there to be found; And
it may be in ſtubborn and chronical diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
they might be glad to ſteal now and
then ſome Chalybeate or Mercurial prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
out of that contemptible book;
and yet rail at it, for affording them that
kindneſs at ſo dead a lift: and further I
might tell them that in acute diſeaſes, there
are as efficacious Chymical medicines to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:57184:90"/>
be found in that Diſpenſatory, as moſt of
their Laboratories will afford: and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
did any of their Shops or Furnaces ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
them with half ſo many of thoſe Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
oyles, Mineral ſolvents, Diaphore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
powders, Chalibeate, Vitriolick, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonial,
Mercurial and Anodyne prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations;
Eſſential and Lixivial ſalts, with
ſafe and experimental Chymical Emeticks
and Catharticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that are there to be
found; we ſhould have had them applauded
for <hi>Polyacea's,</hi> and <hi>Panacea's</hi> too: ſome of
which, might probably have as well an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
the <hi>Helmontians</hi> primary indication
in the cure of diſeaſes, as their <hi>ſingular</hi>
Arcana <hi>of ſo general uſe fabricated out of</hi>
Mercury; it being, as they tell us, <hi>the
pacifying, indulging and gratifying the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus,
the Architectonical contriver of our
firſt being; every Atome of thoſe generous
remedies, ſending forth lively illuſtrious
beams; with the intuition of which, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus
being wonderfully affected and infinitely
delighted, it layeth aſide all moroſity, melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
exorbitant paſſions, and the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of deformed Ideas; by means whereof
an Eutaxie, Eucraſie and Symmetrie in the
inferior orbs of the Microcoſm follows:</hi> and
others of them, as fully their ſecond prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:57184:90"/>
indication, which is, as they ſay, <hi>the
ablation of the inward efficient Cauſe</hi> and <hi>the
outward occaſional irritating matter,</hi> by ſuch
generous remedies, <hi>which taking part with
Nature, might help her to conquer evils and
exclude the Noſopoietick thorns and briars,
thoſe goads in the ſides of the Archeus, exti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulating
it to enormous paſſions and perturba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
through the Sluce and outlet moſt patu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
and convenient:</hi> as an <hi>Acid ſon</hi> of

method of curing Chymically.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to proceed, notwithſtanding the <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi>
Diſpenſatory hath furniſhed us with
the forementioned Chymical preparations,
it muſt not only be hector'd againſt, but
<hi>damned</hi> by Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and his Companions;
either becauſe it pretends not to teach them
the preparations of the <hi>Solar, Lunar, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial,
Saturnal, Jovial, Venereal and Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial,
Metalline Sulphures or Coeleſtial Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors;</hi>
or rather, becauſe it hath that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable
fault accompanying it, <hi>viz.</hi> its
Authority from the learned Colledge of
Phyſicians in <hi>London;</hi> which will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
give it a far greater reputation amongſt
all judicious men, than the Chymical
Champion of your cauſe will give the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
Laboratory, by telling the world
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:57184:91"/>
that <hi>ſince he had found the Company of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries
had erected a Laboratory at their
Hall, for ſupply of their Shops with Medicines
of all ſorts of the Chymical preparation, he was
reſolved wholly to refer Patients with bills to
receive medicines diſpenſed by their hands;</hi>
which new device, though expected to
prove advantageous, yet I wiſh he finds it
not (as you prognoſticate of the Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
of our Age) <hi>the laſt part he hath to
play or trick to ſhew, to entertain Spectators,
and amuſe the world, to uphold ſome repute
among ſuch as are ignorant, and draw on Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers;</hi>
and for my own part, I am to apt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
that this action of his, may be ſo ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
amongſt his Brethren the <hi>Arcana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers</hi>
of <hi>London,</hi> that it may occaſion

I come now to enter upon ſome ſhort diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of the <hi>methodus medendi;</hi> which
though our Adverſaries, nay it may be

perſons an account of the great

of it; and that becauſe I frequently
obſerve, that the Enthuſiaſtick Pſeudo-Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts
of our Age, do ſo much contemn and
decry it; being maſters (as they pretend)
of ſuch great <hi>Arcana</hi> in Phyſick, as will
happily Cure diſeaſes without it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore endeavour to clear the
truth of this aſſertion, by producing ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
inſtances both of Acute and Chronical
diſeaſes, whoſe happy Cure is principally
(if not ſolely) to be attributed to the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
method of the diſcreet and judicious
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:57184:92"/>
Phyſician; amongſt the number of which,
I ſhall firſt begin with Fevers; they being
to be ranked amongſt the moſt Epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical
diſtempers we know of.</p>
                  <p>And in the firſt place, we will diſcourſe
of thoſe, that are generally owned as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid;
in which are conſtantly obſerved <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione
motûs,</hi> four conſiderable mutations, <hi>viz.</hi>
their beginning, augmentation, ſtate and
declination.</p>
                  <p>In the beginning of which putrid Fevers,
'tis uſually obſerved; that the Sulphureous
parts of the blood growing too luxuriant,
do break forth into a flame; agitating the
whole maſs in a preternatural manner;
whereby its <hi>craſis</hi> is in danger of being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
its veſſels too much diſtended;
and if not timely calmed, affections of the
Head and Nerves, with pain and ſpaſms
do uſually enſue: wherefore in this ſtate
of the diſeaſe, here are preſent indications
for Phlebotomy to ventilate this maſs of
blood; for a ſpare and refrigerating diet;
for Emeticks, (if indicated) lenient Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharticks,
Clyſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which many times
are no leſs proſperouſly than judiciouſly
preſcribed; this formidable diſtemper be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
nip't in its bud, it Sulphureous
<hi>pabulum</hi> being extracted by bleeding,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:57184:92"/>
Clyſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or its diſorder quieted by a
cooling diet.</p>
                  <p>But if notwithſtanding the proper appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the forementioned remedies, this
Febrile flame cannot be extinguiſhed; but
it ſtill encreaſeth to a higher degree, ſo
that intolerable thirſt and inquietude, head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache
and watchfulneſs, with <hi>delirium</hi> and
phrenſies do continually attend our Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents:
here are freſh indications for repeated
phlebotomy, clyſters, cooling Julips and
decoctions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> whereby the ſpirits may
be refreſhed, the parched <hi>viſcera</hi> cooled;
and if poſſibly, the motion of the blood ſo
moderated, that it may not injure the head
or <hi>genus nervoſum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the ſtate of this diſeaſe, we are dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
to attend Natures motions; that ſo
we might obſerve whether a future <hi>Criſis</hi>
may be expected or not; which if it doth
appear a perfect and ſalutiferous one; the
febrile heat declines, ſigns of concoction
appear in their urines, and all things prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticate
a ſpeedy and happy recovery:
But on the other hand, if Natures attempts
be too weak for making a full diſcharge of
that aduſt, febrile matter, which hath
paſſed its due deflagration, and is fitted for
expulſion; we ought then to afford her
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:57184:93"/>
ſome gentle aſſiſtance by ſome mild Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoretick
or lenient cathartick; according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
as we obſerve at that nick of time the
tendency of her motions: But if we find,
that in this ſtate of the Fever, there is no
<hi>Criſis;</hi> or at beſt, but an imperfect one at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted
by Nature; the Patients pulſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
very weak, and his ſpirits low; we
muſt then be very cautious of any evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
by Sweat or Stool, it being not to be
attempted without manifeſt danger of the
Patients life: And therefore we ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
allow her time, and attend her dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently;
until the blood being reduced to
a more orderly motion, and the ſpirits re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited,
ſhe may gradually make ſecretion
and excluſion of the morbifick matter, in
order to the obtaining of her due and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
temper; than encreaſe the too great
and unhappy confuſion ſhe is already under,
by exhibiting any high Diaphoreticks or
Catharticks; this being a time, that nothing
of medicine is to be allowed, unleſs it be
ſome very temperate Cardiack.</p>
                  <p>In the declination of this diſtemper, an
exactneſs of diet is to be obſerved; and at
length ſome gentle purgations to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed,
to exterminate the reliques of that
febrile matter, which probably may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57184:93"/>
protruded out of the Meſeraick Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
in order to its diſcharge by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtines;
leſt it ſhould be again reſorbed,
and a relapſe enſue thereupon; upon which
account we do likewiſe as ſtrictly forbid
the Patients over-haſty eating of fleſh-meat,
until their Urines appear in colour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
and hypoſtaſis like to thoſe who are
in a healthful ſtate; and then we direct
them to begin with broths, and ſo gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to adventure upon a fleſh diet.</p>
                  <p>To this purpoſe hath the learned Doctor
<hi>Willis</hi> acquainted us in that excellent book
of his <hi>de febribus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now pray let ſober and judicious men
conſider, what apparent hazards and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
they muſt neceſſarily adventure upon,
by employing any, but Phyſicians well
skill'd in their Faculty; ſeeing 'tis apparent
by the foremention'd account of Fevers,
(which I have faithfully acquainted them
with) what diligence and judgment ought
to be made uſe of in every ſtate of this
diſeaſe; that ſo the Patient might happily
be reſtored to his priſtine health and
temper.</p>
                  <p>But now let us ſuppoſe, that in the firſt
attack of this diſtemper, an Empirick
ſhould be ſent for, who being ignorant of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57184:94"/>
its nature, ſhould preſently exhibite ſome
of his <hi>well rectified ſpirits of ſtrong liquors,
compleat Aqua vitae, Punch, Analeptical and
refocillating wines, &amp;c.</hi> can any rational
man imagine that theſe hot and fiery me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
ſhould be any ways proper to bridle
the tumult and ferociency of the blood;
which being already too much exalted by
hot and bilious parts abounding in it, doth
rather require a diſcharge by venae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> or attemperating, by cooling
medicines; than an advancement to a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
pitch of luxuriancy, by the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Chymical liquors? which doubtleſs
can do no leſs than inflame and fire the
whole maſs of blood in a moment: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
'tis evident that Phlebotomy, Clyſters,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> being made uſe of; or large propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Whey and other cooling liquors
freely drunk in the firſt aſſault of theſe Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
have often prevented their farther
encreaſe: but to expect the like advantage
from the forementioned rich and ſpirituous
drinks, would prove as fruitleſs if not foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh,
as to undertake the quenching of an
houſe on fire, by throwing on gunpowder
and fire-balls.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="163" facs="tcp:57184:94"/>
Now if this miſchief muſt neceſſarily
attend theſe Empirical preſcriptions, in the
firſt attack of theſe Fevers; what may we
expect from them in their augmentation?
I dare aſſure you, little elſe but thunder and
lightning; phrenſies, heart-burnings, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> eſpecially ſeeing that the
moſt prudent management of theſe Fevers
in this ſtate of the diſeaſe, can ſcarcely
calm the impetuous motion of the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable
parts of the blood.</p>
                  <p>And if we farther proceed to the
State of this diſtemper, how much ſooner
may theſe Empiricks diſpatch their poor
languiſhing Patients, whoſe only ſecurity
depends upon their precedent management,
that ſo a perfect and ſalutiferous <hi>Criſis</hi> might
enſue? which if it ſhould not happen, but
their univerſal medicines are made uſe of,
how certainly muſt the ſick bid adieu to
their Relations? this being a time, when
neither Cathartick or Sudorifick, much leſs
any hot or vinous medicines can be uſed,
without manifeſt endangering the Patients
life.</p>
                  <p>And for the declination; what care muſt
be uſed for ſome time, that the Patients eat
no fleſh-meat or broths made of the ſame;
leſt an unhappy relapſe ſhould enſue; how
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57184:95"/>
can we then imagine that their ſpirituous
medicines or <hi>Aqua vitae's,</hi> impregnated with
brisk and active vegetables, may then be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
of?</p>
                  <p>But 'tis poſſible they will tell me, that
they are not without other Chymical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations,
which they uſe upon ſuch occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and in ſuch diſtempers as we diſcourſe
of; <hi>viz.</hi> their <hi>Elixir viviſicans,</hi> their <hi>pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vis
Catholicus diaphoreticus, Aurum vitae dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoreticum,
Elixir grande Cordiale, &amp;c.</hi>
which one of the moſt candid and ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
of that Society hath told us, that they
are to him (with ſome others that he hath
mentioned) <hi>quaſi tot medicinae columnae, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, if this be ſo, I wiſh
that Mr. <hi>H.</hi> would tell us, how he durſt
pretend to the world, that one ſingle me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine
ſhould <hi>ſuit all palates and conſtitutions;</hi>
and that others of his Tribe ſhould no leſs
ignorantly than confidently engage, that
their private <hi>Arcana will perform in helping
all curable diſeaſes, what in reaſon may be
expected from all other.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But give me leave, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to tell you,
that I very much ſuſpect that neither you
nor any of your fraternity do well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the exhibition of your own remedies;
they being rarely to be adminiſtred (as I
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:57184:95"/>
before ſhewed) in putrid Fevers; by reaſon
that there are uſually contraindications to
their exhibition, both in the beginning,
augmentation and ſtate of them; leſt in the
two former they ſhould occaſion too violent
an ebullition of the blood; and in the later
wholly impede her <hi>Criſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For I would have them to underſtand,
that theſe Fevers are uſually but Natures
inſtruments, to diſcharge the luxuriant and
bilious parts of the blood; when they are
apt to exceed their due bounds and limits;
which if prudently managed by an Artiſt
in the Faculty, ſhe will gradually defla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grate
this morbifick matter, and being
over-burdened with it, will both ſeparate
and exclude it; and this much more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
and opportunely, than if ſhe were
diſordered by any of your <hi>Jovial powders,</hi>
or <hi>Solar diaphoreticks;</hi> Nature wiſely ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
her proper periods and times, when
this ſecretion and excluſion of the recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the blood ſhould be made, to the
greateſt relief and advantage of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent;
whereas your medicines (as I before
intimated) do uſually diſturb all her regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
actings, and make a confuſion in the very
<hi>craſis</hi> of the blood; and therefore are as
wiſely adminiſtred to cure this ſort of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:57184:96"/>
before Natures appointed time;
(which is uſually about the thirteenth or
fourteenth day) as they would be to a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
in expectation of bringing forth a
healthful and living child, in five or ſix
months time.</p>
                  <p>Now if theſe putrid Fevers ought to be
managed with ſo much diligence and obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;
how wofully would theſe men
bungle and miſcarry with all their applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<hi>Arcana,</hi> when they were called to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite
them in Fevers ſpecifically different
from the former?</p>
                  <p>As for inſtance, the putrid Fevers of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
in Child-bed, where cooling or heat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
remedies are equally dangerous; their
proper indications principally allowing the
uſe of Uterines; whereby the blood
might be attenuated and diſpoſed to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge
it ſelf by the Iliack and Hypoga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrick
veſſels, in order to its neceſſary depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>And thus, I might likewiſe inſtance in
thoſe lacteal Fevers; which uſually attend
the female ſex about the third or fourth day
after delivery; which are ſolely to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged
by a ſpare and appropriate diet; and
committed to Natures regimen; and
though many times the Symptomes that do
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:57184:96"/>
accompany this ſort of Fevers, are a little
troubleſome, and it may be frightful too,
to the Patients; as heat, thirſt, inquietude
of the whole body, pain in the back, ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
breaſts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet if theſe be not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
by ſome over-haſty and undue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations,
they uſually are freed from
them within three or four dayes, by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
<hi>Criſis</hi> of Natures own procuring.</p>
                  <p>I might further acquaint Mr. <hi>H.</hi> with
the miſchiefs that muſt neceſſarily
have attended their <hi>Coeleſtial liquors</hi> and
<hi>Stomachical eſſences</hi> in ſeveral Fevers that
our late dayes have produced (of which
the world will ſpeedily have a very full
and ſatisfactory account from that excellent
Methodiſt, the induſtrious Dr. <hi>Sydenham)</hi>
as particularly the Fevers which did accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
the Small pox, when it was the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical
diſtemper of the Town; wherein
the forementioned Chymical preparations
would have been ſo far from alleviating or
curing thoſe ſevere Symptoms that did at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
them, that they would rather have
highly encreaſed them; amongſt the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of which Symptomes, profuſe and
violent Sweats would uſually (if not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly)
accompany the ſick and feeble Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients,
even from their firſt invaſion; and
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:57184:97"/>
that though no Medicines were exhibited,
or other means made uſe of, to encreaſe that
diſeaſe of the blood, lympha, or nervous
liquor.</p>
                  <p>And truly, ſo much have moſt of our late
Fevers differed from thoſe putrid ones I
lately diſcourſed of; that I doubt not but
moſt obſerving and unprejudiced Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
will frankly own, that the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Sweats were ſo far from relieving
or curing the Symptoms that attended their
Patients; that uſually more dangerous and
mortal ones did ſpeedily affect both head
and <hi>genus nervoſum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now ſurely, if our Indications may beſt
be taken from the <hi>juvantia</hi> and <hi>laedentia</hi> in
Phyſick, we cannot allow thoſe diſcharges
as critical, which are rarely or never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with relief to the Patient; but do
rather ſeem to proceed from ſome ſtrange
perverſion and fluor of the maſs of blood,
and other noble juices of the body: and
though it muſt be allowed, that in all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods
ſome muſt dye; yet doubtleſs every
honeſt and conſcientious Phyſician is very
diligent to obſerve, to what method of
Cure a diſeaſe doth moſt happily and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
yield; and therefore in Epidemical
diſtempers, that ſeem to be ſpecifically
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:57184:97"/>
different from each other; the advice of
the learned Doctor <hi>Willis</hi> may be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
entertained, which he giveth us in
caſes of this nature; <hi>Praeter medici cujus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
privatum judicium, experientia potiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mùm
medendi rationem ſuppeditat; cùm enim
hae Febres primò graſſantur, ſinguli ferè ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gula

monitiſque munitur.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to proceed; I would gladly know
of Mr. <hi>H.</hi> and the reſt of the <hi>Arcana</hi>-mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
of this Town, who are apt to believe
that all diſtempers may be happily cured
by their ſtrong and <hi>Vinous liquors, Diapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick
powders, &amp;c.</hi> what they would have
done in thoſe peſtilential and malignant
diſeaſes, which could be cured by no other
method, but that, which they continually
decry and exclaim againſt; although very
powerful Alexipharmick and Diaphoretick
medicines had been frequently made uſe
of in the forementioned caſes, to little or
no advantage. And that they may not charge
me with diſcourſing any thing of my own
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:57184:98"/>
ſence in theſe caſes; I will acquaint them
with my Authors, and ſome obſervations
that I have read of this kind.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The firſt they may find in the 359 page
of</hi> Riverius <hi>his</hi> praxis, <hi>where he giveth
us an account of a</hi> peſtilential Fever, that
raged in ſo great violence at <hi>Montpelier</hi> in
the year 1623, that multitudes died of it;
<hi>And further lie telleth us,</hi> that he obſerved
that in all thoſe Patients, quibus parotides
ſuperveniebant; which was uſually about the
ninth or eleventh day of the diſeaſe, (there
commonly preceeding or accompanying a <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium,</hi>
ſtupor, convulſive motions, with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal
formicating pulſes, &amp;c.) they all died
within two dayes after; notwithſtanding the
frequent exhibition of Alexipharmick medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,
and the diligent application of Topicks;
<hi>which engaged this ingenious and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Phyſician to think,</hi> that theſe ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
proved ſo fatal, becauſe the parts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
were not capable of receiving all the
morbifick matter; wherefore that which ſtill
remained in the blood, killed the Patient;
<hi>and therefore he thought,</hi> that Natures work
being begun in thoſe ſwellings, might be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
ſupplied by venae-ſection or gentle purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
<hi>But theſe indications ſeemed to be
contra-indicated,</hi> by the great imbecillity of
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57184:98"/>
the Patients, who appeared to be even in the
agonies of death; yet on the other hand con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering,
that it was better to experiment a
doubtful remedy in one or two perſons, than to
leave ſo many to undoubted deſtruction: he
reſolved firſt to preſcribe Phlebotomy to the
quantity of three ounces, which blood was
very corrupt; and after three or four hours
the Patients pulſe waxing ſtronger, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
him the day following to preſcribe
him a lenient purge, which likewiſe was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with that good ſucceſs, that his deplo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Patient was delivered from the jaws of
death; and afterwards <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> all the
ſick that had theſe <hi>parotides</hi> behind their
ears, I firſt bled ſeveral times a little at a
time, and the day following purged them,
and ſo all of them who were thus ordered, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
recovered; not one of them afterwards
dying in the whole year, that had thoſe <hi>paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tides</hi>
behind their ears. <hi>Which obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
this learned and ingenuous Phyſician
thought ſo neceſſary to communicate, that
he tells us in the forementioned page,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne
hoc experimentum ſilentio praeterire ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fas
fuiſſet.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And in the fourth Century of his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations
he acquaints us, that</hi> in the plague
it ſelf, an ingenious Phyſician having under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57184:99"/>
the care of the third part of a City miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
afflicted <hi>with that depopulating diſeaſe,</hi>
he preſcribed to all his Patients an Emetick
potion, whereby he was ſo happy as to cure al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
all that were committed to his care, he
ſcarcely loſing ten or twelve for his part;
when as in the other two parts of the Town,
few eſcaped.</p>
                  <p>And if any of your friends, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> will
take the pains to conſult the reſt of his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
in malignant Fevers; they may
find him frequently uſing the Launcet, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> even in thoſe caſes where
violet coloured ſpots, exanthemata, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
have appeared.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>As particularly</hi> in a Counſellor who was
fifty five years old; who upon the ninth day
of his diſeaſe fell into ravings and convulſive
motions of his hands, with a certain profound
ſleepineſs, and looſeneſs; which Symptoms were
likewiſe attended with exanthemata, <hi>&amp;c. yet
notwithſtanding theſe</hi> direful Symptoms, <hi>and
the great evacuations the patient had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone
from a</hi> Diarrhoea and Cupping glaſſes;
he bled him on the twelfth day to the quantity
of four or five ounces; which blood being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
and the Patient bearing it well, he bled
him the like quantity five hours after; the
Patient finding no diminution of his ſtrength
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:57184:99"/>
thereby; <hi>and thus by the forementioned uſe
of the Launcet and temperate medicines, he
gradually recovered his health.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Another Patient he mentions in the
fourth Century of his obſervations, p.</hi> 79, 80.
who upon conſultation was ordered to be bled,
notwithſtanding he had blewiſh ſpots broken
out all over his body; which gave the Patient
great relief, he being in a ſhort time happily
cured; <hi>And though we find that one of
thoſe learned Phyſicians upon their conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
did at firſt oppoſe Phlebotomy;</hi> leſt
the malignant matter ſhould ſtrike in again;
<hi>yet upon the others reply,</hi> that there was
little fear of that, by reaſon it had been for
ſome dayes protruded into the habit of the
body; <hi>they both conſented to the fore-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd
remedy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And in his ſecond Century, he tells us
of</hi> a Citizen extremely weakned with a malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
Fever; whom he undertook to purge with
a gentle infuſion three or four dayes together,
whereby his ſtrength was a little encreaſed, and
by little and little he began to be better; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating
his purgations at certain times.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And in an</hi> Epidemical Fever which raged
ſo violently at <hi>Avignion, Bellicadre</hi> and
other places, that very few eſcaped, their
chief Symptoms being a Cough, pain of the
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:57184:100"/>
Head and loyns, frenzies, phthiſical affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
&amp;c. the remedies that were found effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,
were pectoral medicaments, gentle purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
(not forgetting blood-letting as princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally
efficacious) cooling Clyſters, Cupping<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſſes,
Cordial opiates, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Which obſervations do put me in mind
of what an ingenious Licentiate of the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Phyſicians acquainted me with,
in the late malignant Fevers, that accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed
the Small pox at</hi> Colcheſter, <hi>when it was
the Epidemical diſeaſe of that Town,</hi> viz.
that thoſe Fevers were very acute and mortal,
being attended with prodigious Sweats, ſpaſms,
tremulous motions in the hands, ſtiffneſs in
their jaws, livid ſpots in their bodies, &amp;c.
<hi>and though that obſerving Phyſician was a
great</hi> Helmontian, <hi>and did frequently exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bite
high</hi> Alexipharmicks <hi>and</hi> Bezoardick
Cordials; <hi>yet ſaith he,</hi> they ſignified no more
than chips in pottage, the Patients generally
dying under the uſe of them; but at length
bleeding was attempted, which cured ſeveral,
though it were uſed the eighth or twelfth day
of their diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed; though in the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
obſervations we may take notice,
that <hi>Alexipharmick</hi> and <hi>Diaphoretick</hi> reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
did not ſo well anſwer the ſeeming
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:57184:100"/>
indications for them; but Phyſicians were
neceſſitated to alter their methods of pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice:
yet how efficacious this <hi>Claſſis</hi> of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
was in the late <hi>London</hi> peſtilential
Fever, is as evident, by that account
Doctor <hi>Sydenham</hi> hath acquainted us with,
in the ſecond Edition of his book <hi>de Febri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus;</hi>
where he telleth us, that after he had
Sweat his Patients twenty four hours, he
obſerved that they were ſo far from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining
of the loſs &amp; decay of their ſtrength
by that plentiful evacuation they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went
by Sweating; that they rather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
more life and vigour thereby: <hi>tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
enim abeſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ut ſe exinde de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biliores
factos quererentur, quin potius quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
ſupervacanei humoris ſudando dejeciſſent,
tantundem novi roboris ſibi accreviſſe profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terentur—</hi>
And that which was very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable
in theſe peſtilential Fevers was this;
that towards the latter end of the foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
Sweats, there would break forth
freſh ones more natural, genuine, and eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious
than the former; and that without
the help of Medicines, which were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
with much more eaſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment
to the Patient, they being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
critical and eradicative.</p>
                  <p>Now by comparing this laſt obſervation
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57184:101"/>
and thoſe mentioned by the eminently
learned and famous <hi>Diemerbroeck,</hi> with
thoſe other I juſt now acquainted the
Reader with, we may eaſily obſerve what
a neceſſity there is of following that advice
of the learned Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> in caſes of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
which I lately quoted; and farther how
many peoples lives would have been ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed
to Empirical preſcriptions, had they
in the forementioned diſtempers relyed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
them, there ſeeming to be (as I intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted)
ſome ſpecifical difference even amongſt
theſe peſtilential and malignant diſeaſes,
by reaſon they would not yield to one and
the ſame method of cure, though it was
rationally attempted.</p>
                  <p>And though we will allow Mr. <hi>H.</hi> that
Empirical preſcriptions are not like to be
accompanied with thoſe unhappy and fatal
conſequences in the diſtempers we juſt now
diſcourſed of, by reaſon they are ſometimes of
a ſtrengthening &amp; ſudorifick nature; which
are generally indicated in theſe diſeaſes; yet
how much miſchief they are like to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
with in putrid and other Epidemical
Fevers, I have in part ſhewn already, and
ſhall now take notice of in variolous caſes.</p>
                  <p>In which I take the indications for cure
to be the very ſame, that the judicious
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:57184:101"/>
Doctor <hi>Sydenham</hi> hath laid down in his
book <hi>de febribus, viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. The preſervation of the maſs of blood,
during its time of ſeparation and expulſion,
in that exact and equal motion, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſion
of the morbifick matter might nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
be too haſty or precipitant, nor yet too
dull or ſluggiſh; the firſt (as he excellently
obſerveth) procuring too often, violent
Phrenſies, or ſuch profuſe Sweats as might
occaſion the ſecretion and excluſion of thoſe
parts of the blood, which never were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
or deſigned by Nature for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe;
the later impeding or hindering the
due expulſion of the variolous matter:
and therefore in the beginning of this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper,
he is no leſs fearful of admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
too high Cordials, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> than he is of
Bleeding, Clyſters, cooling medicines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His ſecond indication is taken, from the
time of the expulſion of the variolous puſtles,
into the habit of body; in which he is very
careful that thoſe Abſceſſes of natures pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding,
might be preſerved in a due man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
until they arrive to a ſtate of matura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and decidency. And therefore at this
time is he as diligently and ſtudiouſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
to prevent the too high ebullition
of the blood, leſt whilſt theſe puſtles are
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:57184:102"/>
in their ſtate of crudity, any of their morbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick
parts ſhould be reſorbed; as he is, that
the blood ſhould not grow too languid or
weak, leſt Nature ſhould be unable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
what is required at her hands.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing 'tis manifeſt, by this ſhort
account I have given of this diſtemper, what
care and judgment ought to be uſed by every
prudent Phyſician for the Cure hereof; how
unfit, yea dangerous muſt Empirical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
of neceſſity be in caſes of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
where too great an exaltation or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the maſs of blood is alike dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
and where there may be indications
for cooling remedies, or at leaſt for thoſe
that are very temperate, as well as for
Cordials?</p>
                  <p>But to proceed, we will now diſcourſe of
a Chronical diſtemper, <hi>viz.</hi> the Scurvy;
which ſome of Mr. <hi>H</hi>'s fraternity do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to cure by their <hi>golden purging ſpirits,
Spirits of Scurvey-graſs, Elixir Salutis, &amp;c.</hi>
not making any obſervation as to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
conſtitutions of the Patients to whom
they are exhibited; whereas tis undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
true that many Patients, who are afflicted
with the forementioned diſtemper, have the
conſtituent principles of their blood, ſo much
differing from others; either from an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:57184:102"/>
indiſpoſition, or ſome irregularities
in the non-naturals, or the like; that ſome
of them ſhall have their blood chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted
of dull and torpid parts, and others
of hot, aduſt and bilious; inſomuch that 'tis
clear and evident, that the remedies which
are indicated in one conſtitution, ought not
to be uſed in the other: for where the dyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſie
of the blood doth chiefly conſiſt in a
ſaline-ſulphureous or impoveriſhed maſs,
there remedies that are not impregnated with
hot, vinous and volatile parts, may be highly
ſerviceable, by reaſon they do as it were
afreſh actuate and enliven this flat and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved
blood, inſpiring it with additional
ferments. But then, if this ſort of remedies
ſhould be exhibited to thoſe ſcorbutick bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
whoſe <hi>diatheſis</hi> of blood, ſpirits and
other humors conſiſt in too hot and nitro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulphureous
parts; how ſoon would they
upon every light occaſion, be hurried into
Fevers, violent tumults, heat and diſorders of
the whole body? the proper indications for
medicines in this caſe, being only for ſuch,
as we call mild or temperate; which gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
do calm and quiet the forementioned
diſorders of the blood, ſedate its too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
and preternatural fermentations, and
in proceſs of time ſo purifie and alter it, that
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:57184:103"/>
it ſhall recover its priſtine and native tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>And that I might more fully and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factorily
clear the truth of this aſſertion, I
will acquaint Mr.</hi> H. <hi>what his</hi> unanſwerable
<hi>friend hath obſerved to this purpoſe,</hi> viz.
<hi>in</hi> p. 92. <hi>of his</hi> Medela Medicinae, <hi>where he
tells you, that</hi> Scurvy-graſs, Water-creſs, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Wormwood, Water-mint, Horſe-radiſh, &amp;c.
do a world of miſchief, and are eminently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
in the Scurvey, where the diſeaſe is
lodged in a blood and humors full of acidity or
acrimony, and abounding with a vitious vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
ſalt; <hi>by reaſon, they</hi> render the ſalient
particles of all ſorts, the more capering, turgid
and unruly within the veins, and ſend them a
gadding thence about the habit of the body;
by which means a foundation is laid for Agues
of all ſorts, Fevers, Vertigoes, running pains,
ſtitches, Head-aches, Cramps, Convulſions,
Griping of the guts, ſhort Breathings, ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the Cheſt, Fluxes of all ſorts, Gouts, Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pochondriack
and Hyſterical paſſions, Inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
Pleuriſies and all diſeaſes of the Lungs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nay, ſo full is he in the defence of what
I have diſcourſed of in a diſeaſe, which he
would perſwade the world is no leſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
than the Scurvy, (it having (as he
ſaith)</hi> ſo corrupted the frame of Nature, that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57184:103"/>
even in Countrey-Cottages 'tis a hard matter
to find a woman in <hi>puris naturalibus) that he
tells us,</hi> p. 80. <hi>of the forementioned book;</hi>
that the common ſort of Receipt-mongers ſhould
undertake the management of this Cure, and
that the wealthier ſort of men ſhould ſo readily
venture their bodies in their hands, ſhews the
<hi>blind boldneſs</hi> of the one, and the marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
indiſcretion of the other. I will grant <hi>(ſaith
he)</hi> that 'tis poſſible an ordinary man may be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with a method very good and ſufficient
in general againſt this diſeaſe, and he may do
ſome Cures with it, &amp;c. but that ſuch a man
ſhould think himſelf fit with ſuch a traditional
method and the credit of having cured ſome by
it, to undertake the cure in all caſes, is <hi>terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
to conſider,</hi> ſince every <hi>rational Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſer
knows,</hi> there is ſo great a <hi>variety</hi> in
the Pox it ſelf, reſpecting the nature of the
venome, and other qualifications of the body
in which 'tis ſeated, that in a <hi>thouſand bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
infected, you ſhall not find two that
are alike circumſtantiated,</hi> or that yield
concurrents ſo alike, as that there will ariſe
thence the like <hi>indication</hi> for cure in the one
as in the other; or <hi>that the ſame method
and medicines may be uſed to one as to
another, without prejudice and damage;</hi>
which frequently happens to be ſo great, that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57184:104"/>
inſtead of curing this diſeaſe they exaſperate it;
and do often precipitate mens bodies into other
deſtroying diſtempers. I might <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> be
copious in inſtances to confirm this from my own
obſervation; but that being not fit to be done,
you may ſee enough in the obſervations of <hi>Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtius,
Zacutus, Riverius, &amp;c.</hi> in whom you
will find (as we ſay in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Proverb)
what is one man's meat, may be another man's
poyſon; what cured one of the Pox was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
to another; <hi>thoſe wiſe men ever
varying the way and means of curing,
according to the nature of the perſon
and diſeaſe they were to deal with.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Now good Mr.</hi> H. <hi>do you and the reſt of
your friends ſeriouſly peruſe theſe paſſages
faithfully quoted out of your</hi> unanſwerable
book, <hi>and then tell me, what fair defence
you can make in telling the world, that
your</hi> Coeleſtial liquor will ſuit all palates and
conſtitutions; <hi>that your</hi> Spirit of Scurvy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graſs
incorporated with its fixed ſalt, with your
Golden purging Spirits, will prevent the Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy
and cure it alſo, if not of too long continuance;
and if ſo, the later will certainly effect the
cure, if the diſeaſe be curable; <hi>and therefore
'tis commended as</hi> beneficial to all perſons that
travel by land or ſea: <hi>and that</hi> your pills are
the moſt approved remedy for relief of mankind
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:57184:104"/>
againſt all medicable or curable diſtempers:
<hi>yea one of your gang hath been ſo bold and
impudent, as in publick print to tell the
world, that</hi> his Pills are the true tincture of
the Sun, and hath dominion from the ſame
light; for as the Sun at its appearance giveth
nouriſhment to all creatures, ſo do his pills give
preſent relief, comfort and nouriſhment to all
mankind; <hi>nay he tells us,</hi> that they are the
greateſt temporal bleſſing, that ever God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
upon the ſons and daughters of men:
<hi>and yet his Antagoniſt hath publiſhed to the
world; that</hi> a Chymiſt hath made Oath, that
he extracted out of a very few of theſe Pills
near half a ſmall vial glaſs of Quick-ſilver,
which he hath ſealed by him.</p>
                  <p>But, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> that I might farther inform
you of what may be done by ordinary me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
well managed by method, I will
acquaint you with the following obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The firſt is taken out of the Lord</hi> Bacon<hi>'s
Natural Hiſtory, who tells you,</hi> p. 16. <hi>that</hi>
there be many medicines, which by themſelves
would do no Cure, but perhaps hurt; but being
applyed in a certain order one after another, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>
great Cures. I have tryed my ſelf <hi>(ſaith he)</hi>
a remedy for the Gout, which hath ſeldom fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but driven it away in twenty four hours
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:57184:105"/>
ſpace; It is firſt to apply a pulteſs, then a bath,
and then a plaiſter; the firſt relaxeth the pores
and maketh the humors apt to exhale; the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation
calleth forth the Humor by vapours;
and the plaiſter repelleth new humor from fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling:
<hi>now ſaith he,</hi> The pulteſs alone would
make the part more ſoft and weak, and apter to
take the defluxion and impreſſion of the humor;
the fomentation alone, if it were too weak, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
way made by the pulteſs, would draw forth
little; if too ſtrong, it would draw to the part,
as well as draw from it: the plaiſter alone,
would pen the humor already contained in the
part, and ſo exaſperate it, as well as forbid
new humor: therefore they muſt all be taken in
order as is ſaid.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond obſervation ſhall be of the <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lera
morbus,</hi> a diſeaſe which is oft-times no leſs
violent than mortal; upon which account
it may truly be ranked amongſt thoſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers
the Ancients called <hi>extremè pera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuti;</hi>
its Symptoms being often times ſo
violent, that in ſix or eight hours ſpace,
ſtrong, and luſty men have been reduced to
ſpaſms and Convulſions, with other as well
amazing as ſurprizing Symptoms; and yet
have I ſeen theſe per acute and cruel diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers
relieved in a few hours ſpace by a reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
of no higher extraction than Chicken
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:57184:105"/>
broth; and that although the Patients have
been judged both by themſelves and all their
Relations to have been entring the very
confines of death; yet in a few dayes time
they have been well and healthful again,
and that without the uſe of any <hi>Chymical Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cana.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thus by a no leſs ſucceſsful than ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
method, hath the induſtrious Doctor
<hi>Sydenham</hi> acquainted us with the Cure of
that cruel and tormenting diſeaſe, the Iliack
paſſion.</p>
                  <p>And I doubt not, but that ere long he will
give us an account of ſeveral other proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
methods which he made uſe of in the
Dyſentery, Colick, Hyſterick affections, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
which have been attended with ſo ſpeedy
and happy ſucceſs, that all the effectual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies
which Mr. <hi>H.</hi> obtain'd by his <hi>labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
pains and travels,</hi> deſerve not to come
in competition with thoſe <hi>Galenical</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions
methodically adminiſtred, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
he performed the forementioned Cures;
and whatever Mr. <hi>H.</hi> may think, I am apt to
believe that in proceſs of time, that Phyſician
will be univerſally judged the greateſt Artiſt
in his Faculty, who can cure diſeaſes much
more <hi>ſpeedily, eaſily, and ſafely</hi> by the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
adminiſtration and methodical pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:57184:106"/>
of proper medicines, (though <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenical)</hi>
than he that patcheth upon every

of his <hi>pilulae in omnes morbos,</hi> in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
printed pamphlet.</p>
                  <p>I could likewiſe tell Mr. <hi>H.</hi> that I could
acquaint him with a <hi>
                        <gap reason="illegible" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap>alenical</hi> medicine
methodically uſed, which hath been much
more ſucceſsful in the Cure of quartano
Agues, than his <hi>Coeleſtial liquor or appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate
remedies,</hi> which ſometimes have been
ſo violent in ther oper<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tion, that they have
endangered the tranſlation of his Patients
into a <hi>Coeleſtial</hi> Countrey.</p>
                  <p>I might further aſſure him, that I have
ſeen a medicine ſo judiciouſly managed in
ſome diſeaſes accompanied with moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
racking, and tormenting pains; that
the Patients in a few hours have not only
been relieved from thoſe dreadful tortures;
but by a methodical uſe of it, ſecured from
all danger of a relapſe; which medicine
ſhould it have been uſed without this due
circumſpection and method, it would have
inevitably ruined and deſtroyed the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents
to whom it had been exhibited.</p>
                  <p>I could thus proceed to acquaint all
ingenious perſons, with what care and
obſervation is made uſe of by all honeſt
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:57184:106"/>
and conſcientious Phyſicians in the exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition
of their remedies for the relief or
cure of all other diſtempers, which are
incident to humane bodies; as Hypochon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>driack
Melancholy, Dropſies, Jaundies,
Apoplexies, Sanguineous fluxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who
being men of liberal education, and well
acquainted with the component parts of
humane bodies, and the cauſes that do or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily
put them into diſorders, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
that variety of Symptoms which do
uſually accompany diſtempers; they do
wiſely conſider, as the learned Doctor <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis</hi>
hath well obſerved; <hi>quippe dum mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtò
liquet, cujuſmodi particulae in patiente
aut alterandae, aut in motum concitandae;
&amp; quales in agente ad opus illud requiruntur,
non difficile erit hoc ſatis aptè deſignare, ac ad al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum
illud rite-accommodare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And though, Mr. <hi>H.</hi> I will not ſcruple to
allow you that ſome Chymical remedies
may be of great value and excellency for
their admirable efficacy in the Cure of
ſome diſtempers; yet doubtleſs they are
not to be uſed without methods, nor yet,
where there are not fair indications for
preſcribing them; unleſs we were willing
to ſacrifice our Patients lives to ignorance
and confidence: neither do I underſtand
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:57184:107"/>
wherefore they ſhould be applauded in
thoſe caſes, where other remedies have
been experimented much more powerful
and ſucceſsful in their operation; which
occaſioned that noble Chymical Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
Mr. <hi>Boyle</hi> to confeſs, that <hi>he never
knew any of the vulgar Chymiſts Eſſences or
Elixirs half ſo powerful a remedy to ſtanch
blood, as a ſlight mixture of Hen-bane and
white Poppy ſeeds, beaten up into a ſtiff Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
with Conſerve of Roſes; nor ever did
he ſee ſuch wonderful effects againſt ſpitting
and vomiting of blood, of the moſt elaborate
Chymical preparations, as he had done of a
ſlight Syrup made of the juice of Plantane,
Comfrey,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>But to draw near a concluſion of this
diſcourſe, I do very much hope that all
ingenious perſons who have taken the pains
to peruſe this Book, and therein obſerved
how much pains and induſtry, how much
learning and judgment is required to the
due qualification of an able Phyſician;
will not only gratefully own how much
this Nation is endebted to the labours of
the famous Univerſities and learned Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Phyſicians; whoſe members have
been ſo indefatigably induſtrious in every
province of Phyſick, as if they ſeemed
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:57184:107"/>
thereby to tell the world, that they could
never reſt ſatisfied, till they had obtained
as great a perfection in their Art as it was
capable of; but will likewiſe uſe their joynt
endeavours to detect the folly and knavery
of our <hi>London</hi> Empiricks, whoſe <hi>Elixirs</hi>
and <hi>Panaceas</hi> may be truly aſſigned as
more probable cauſes of the ſtubbornneſs
and contumaciouſneſs of our late diſeaſes,
with their <hi>great and main alterations;</hi> than
the Chimerical Ternary of your <hi>unanſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
friends, viz.</hi> the <hi>Pox, Scurvy,</hi> and
<hi>Worms;</hi> whereby many of his Majeſties
ſubjects have not only been deprived of
the Cure of their diſtempers, but ſacrificed
their lives to the forementioned deteſtable
preſcriptions.</p>
                  <p>'Tis therefore likewiſe to be hoped, that
our Soveraign Lord the King, who hath been
ſo great an Encourager of all liberal Arts
and Sciences, will imitate his Royal Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor
King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, in confirming
that Charter by Act of Parliament, which
out of his Royal bounty he hath lately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
upon his Colledge of Phyſicians,
whereby the mechanical ſucceſſors of thoſe
old Empiricks, exactly deſcribed and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterized
in 3 <hi>H.</hi> 8. may be prevented
for the future, from trying experiments
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:57184:108"/>
upon his Majeſty's Subjects; <hi>to the high
diſpleaſure of God, great infamy of
the Faculty, and the grievous hurt,
damage and deſtruction of the Kings
liege people, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nay further, 'tis to be hoped, that the
Chancellors of our Univerſities, with the
grave Judges of our Land, and all other
perſons of ingenuous or Academick edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
will be exemplary in the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of this no leſs famous than wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
Colledge; that ſo the Laws already
made and eſtabliſhed by the Parliaments
of</hi> England, <hi>being diligently proſecuted
by them, may give ſome check to their
Empirical pride and inſolency, as well as
their bold invaſion of this noble Art of
Medicine, whereby ſo many of the worthy
Profeſſors of it have met with no ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement.
I ſhall therefore crave leave
to conclude this ſubject with what hath
been no leſs ingeniouſly than judiciouſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by a very curious and inquiſitive
perſon,</hi> viz. That if Phyſicians, who are
men of ſo clear judgments, ſo unparallel'd for
induſtry, have no more reſpect or conſideration
than mean, empty, ſhallow pretenders; we may
have reaſon to fear, that hereafter perſons of
ſo great abilities and liberal education, will
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:57184:108"/>
ſcorn to look towards a Faculty, which though
honourable in its own nature, is ſo low and
mean in the eſteem of the world; that every
perſon who hath confidence to affirm he is a
Phyſician, although perfectly ignorant of the
Rudiments of Phyſick, ſhall yet have no leſs
countenance from the publick; than thoſe gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
perſons, who after a long courtſhip have
rendred Nature familiar, are acquainted with
the cauſes and Cure of diſeaſes; and who have
ſo deſerved of mankind, that I cannot but
marſhal them next to thoſe divine perſons,
who alſo as theſe, are often ſlighted and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
although of them the world is not
worthy.</p>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>SInce the writing of the firſt part of my
Book, which relates to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Colledge of Phyſicians by
Law, I underſtood that the Records of the
Parliament, in 14 and 15 <hi>H.</hi> 8. were
to be ſeen at the <hi>Rolls</hi> Chappel; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
me to make a very diligent ſearch
into that Act, and the reſt which concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Colledge of Phyſicians: where I
found upon that Parliament Roll 36 Acts
publick and private, whereof 26 were
ſigned at the bottom with <hi>Reſponſ. Regis
le Roy le veult;</hi> and ten others ſtitched to
theſe on the ſame Roll, without <hi>le Roy le
veult:</hi> But at the end of the Roll there is
affixed a Commiſſion granted by the
King to Cardinal <hi>Woolſey</hi> to Prorogue and
Adjourn the Parliament, from <hi>Blackfryers</hi>
to <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> and there to continue and hold
it; immediately after which Commiſſion
we may find, that upon the 13 day of <hi>Auguſt,</hi>
about ſix in the evening, the King being
preſent, the Houſe of Commons was ſent
for, and Sir <hi>Thomas Moore</hi> their Speaker
<pb facs="tcp:57184:110"/>
having made a very elegant and learned
Speech, he preſented the King with a very
large Subſidy given by the Commons, as a
Teſtimony of their great devotion to their
Prince; which being done, and the Lord
Chancellor having (according to the uſual
cuſtom) privately conferr'd with his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,
he commanded that all thoſe Acts
which were made in that preſent Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
for the publick good, ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
and publiſhed. <hi>Quibus ex ordine per
initia recitatis &amp; lectis ſingulis publicavit
Parliamento reſponſ. ſecundum Annotationes
Regiae voluntatis Declarativas à dors. ſcript.
fact. dictus reverendiſſimus dominus Legatus
Cancellar. exhortando &amp; admonendo nomine
Regis omnes Dominos &amp; Communes ſupra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictos
ut diligenter ordinata Statuta pro bono
publico in hoc Parliamento obſervarent &amp;
ab aliis obſervari procurarent,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now 'tis evident that the Titles of all
Bills that were agreed upon by both
Houſes, were read in the Kings preſence,
and received the Royal Aſſent, though it
was not ingroſſed by the Clerk of the
Parliament upon Ten of thoſe Acts which
are to be ſeen in the forementioned Roll,
which are but Tranſcripts of the Original
Records; and therefore as far as can be
<pb facs="tcp:57184:110"/>
proved, <hi>Roy le veult</hi> might be ingroſs'd
at the top or bottom of theſe Ten as well
as the other 26. in the Original Records;
But however 'tis plain, that the Form and
Eſſence of a Statute Law doth not conſiſt
in the Clerk of the Parliaments engroſſing
the Royal Aſſent at the top or bottom of
an Act, (that not being done until the
Seſſion is over) but in the Clerk of the
Crown's pronouncing of it after he hath
read the Title of each Act, according to
certain inſtructions given from the King.
Now the Clerk having in the audience of
Lords and Commons pronounced aloud to
every publick Bill <hi>le Roy le veult,</hi> to every
private Bill <hi>ſoit fait comme il eſt deſire,</hi> and
to every publick Bill the King refuſeth to
paſs <hi>le Roy ſe aviſera;</hi> 'twas no difficulty
for the Judges and Lawyers, Lords and
Commoners to know what Acts paſſed that
Seſſion; and that this Act relating to Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
did then paſs by this Royal Aſſent,
ſeems very clear; becauſe (as I before inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
in page 8. of my book) a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
within 17 years after in the ſame
Kings Reign owned the Colledge as a Body
Corporate, and gave them ſeveral privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges
which they maintain, and enjoy to
this day; and about 28 or 30 years after,
<pb facs="tcp:57184:111"/>
another Parliament confirmed the 14 and
15 <hi>H.</hi> 8. with every <hi>Article and Clauſe</hi>
therein contained, as you may ſee more at
large, page 9, 10. And that the giving the
Royal Aſſent to theſe two Acts laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. and 1 Q. <hi>M.</hi> might not
be queſtioned, you may ſee it thus ingroſs'd
upon the top of the firſt, <hi>Item alia quaedam
Billa formam cujuſdam Actus in ſe continens
exhibita eſt ſuae Regiae Majeſtati in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mento
praedicto, cujus tenor ſequitur in haec
verba.</hi> And then the whole Statute is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited.
And at the bottom you will find it
thus engroſſed, <hi>Cui quidem Billae perlectae &amp;
ad plenum intellectae per dictum Dominum
noſtrum Regem ex authoritate &amp; aſſenſu Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamenti
praedicti ſic reſponſ. eſt, Soit fait
comme il eſt deſire.</hi> And at the bottom of the
ſecond of the two laſt mentioned Statutes
you will find it thus engroſs'd, <hi>Cui quidem
Billae perlectae &amp; ad plenum intellectae per
dictam Dominam Reginam ex authoritate
Parliamenti praedicti ſic reſponſ. eſt, le Reigne
le veult.</hi> Now 'tis plain that theſe Seſſions
of Parliament were not ſo long diſtant from
the former, but that ſome that were in both
Houſes of Parliament in theſe two Seſſions,
might be in that; and therefore would not
have own'd the forementioned for an Act,
<pb facs="tcp:57184:111"/>
if they had not heard the Royal Aſſent
given to it? But beſides, this Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
with ſome others of the Ten were
ever owned as Acts of Parliament: As for
inſtance, an <hi>Act that the Sir Clerks of
<hi>Chancery</hi> might marry,</hi> an <hi>Act concerning
<hi>Cordwayners,</hi>
               </hi> an <hi>Act of <hi>Tracing Hares,</hi>
               </hi> an
<hi>Act for the <hi>Clothiers</hi>
               </hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> an <hi>Act for
the payment of <hi>Cuſtome,</hi>
               </hi> an <hi>Act for the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi>
               </hi>
or <hi>Port</hi> of <hi>Southhampton;</hi> all which,
with two or three private ones, were
paſſed by the ſame authority that the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians
was; and if that be invalid, all the
former are much more. Nay further, theſe
Acts were publickly printed, and bound
up after that Seſſion; which hath been in
uſe ever ſince Printing hath been common
in <hi>England;</hi> ſo that they may be found
not only in the Rolls Chappel, but in
Mr. <hi>Pulton</hi>'s Statute-book, and in old
Books that are bound up with Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
that were made in particular Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
Reigns, which may be ſeen at Mr. <hi>Millers</hi>
in St. <hi>Paul's</hi> Church-yard.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe that this Teſtimony were not
ſufficient, I would deſire Mr. <hi>H.</hi> to reſolve
me whether the forementioned Parliaments
owning and declaring it as an <hi>Act,</hi> and the
Judges upon ſeveral Tryals giving their
<pb facs="tcp:57184:112"/>
opinions for it, and the receiving it as a
Record into the Rolls Chappel, be not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
enough to prove this very Statute
an Act of Parliament; for I am credibly
informed, that a Record being brought
into the Rolls Chappel, and received as
ſuch by the Maſter of that Court, who is
termed <hi>ſacrorum ſcriniorum Magiſter,</hi> is ſo
far from being queſtion'd, that it is a full
and ſufficient evidence in any Court.</p>
