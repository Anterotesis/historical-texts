            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>DAMON, I'm told the Poets take it ill</l>
               <l>That I am call'd a Brother of the Quill;</l>
               <l>To end their Jealousie, I quit the Name,</l>
               <l>And tho' I honour a true Poet's Fame,</l>
               <l>Yet, since my Genius points out other Ways,</l>
               <l>And bids me strive for Laurels, not for Bays,</l>
               <l>I'll keep my Heart for Great <hi>Bellonas</hi> Charms,</l>
               <l>If e're she takes me to her Glorious Arms,</l>
               <l>She shall Command my Fortune and my Life,</l>
               <l>My Muse is but my Mistress, not my Wife.</l>

               <l>Sometimes, to pass my idle Hours away,</l>
               <l>Or ease at Night the Troubles of the Day,</l>
               <l>Her pleasing Company diverts my Mind,</l>
               <l>And helps my weary Temples to unbind.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The painful Tiller whistles to his Plow,</l>
               <l>And as the rural Virgin milks her Cow,</l>
               <l>Without offence to more accomplish'd Art,</l>
               <l>An untaught Melody revives her Heart:</l>
               <l>So I, who labour in Life's painful Field,</l>
               <l>With harmless Pleasure strive my Cares to gild;</l>
               <l>Whilst, in wild Notes, my heedless Thoughts I sing,</l>
               <l>And make the Neighb'ring Groves and Eccho's ring.</l>
            </lg>

               <l>Like those, who paint for Pastime, not for Gain,</l>

               <l>I grant you, 'tis a Method out of Use,</l>
               <l>But 'tis the best for my unpolish'd Muse;</l>
               <l>She has not learn'd to flatter for Applause,</l>
               <l>Or laugh at any Man without a Cause;</l>
               <l>To injure Virtuous Women for a Jest,</l>
               <l>That none may pass for better than the rest:</l>
               <l>Or do like some, who, when they are refus'd,</l>
               <l>And, for their fond Impertinence, abus'd,</l>
               <l>Vent their weak Malice in a lewd Lampoon,</l>

               <l>A Fault the Sparks are much addicted to,</l>
               <l>They do't themselves, or pay for those that do.</l>
               <l>My Muse has no <hi>Mecenas</hi> to admire</l>
               <l>In Raptures high as Thought, and sometimes higher;</l>
               <l>

               <l>For witty, if his Lordship were an Ass;</l>

               <l>If he liv'd loosely, or betray'd his Trust:</l>
               <l>Nor can she, to oblige a sottish Town,</l>
               <l>Bribe their lewd Fancies for a false Renown,</l>
               <l>By praising Vice, and crying Virtue down.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>This makes some little <hi>Criticks</hi> fume and rage,</l>
               <l>And, in a League, against my Lines engage;</l>
               <l>They are not so concern'd for Wit, or Art,</l>
               <l>But 'tis the Truth that slabs e'm to the Heart.</l>

               <l>Some Heir, whose Father (snatch'd away by Fate)</l>
               <l>Left the young Spark less Judgment than Estate,</l>
               <l>With nothing: but a modern Education,</l>

               <l>And have the Rogue hang'd up in Chains of Verse.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>As for the rambling injudicious Wits,</l>
               <l>Who talk all Weathers, and speak Sense by Fits;</l>
               <l>If they should, in my Absence, run me down,</l>
               <l>And to expose my Weakness, shew their own:</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:59613:6"/>
Let 'em be quiet, and enjoy their Way;</l>
               <l>They answer to the full, what e're they say;</l>
               <l>Satyr upon themselves; They save my Writing;</l>
               <l>And every Thing they say is Devilish biting.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>In short, Each partial Censurer is free</l>
               <l>To play the Fool himself, and laugh at me;</l>
               <l>Let him contrive to carp at what he will;</l>
               <l>Sense will be Sense, and he a Block-head still.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And, <hi>Damon,</hi> since I make this Declaration</l>
               <l>That Poetry's my Pleasure, not Vocation,</l>
               <l>You and your Breth'ren ought not to refuse</l>
               <l>Such Pastime to an unpretending Muse.</l>
               <l>The War, you say, 's my Calling. And what then?</l>
               <l>You use a Sword; Why may not I a Pen?</l>
               <l>You give a Souldier leave to eat and drink;</l>
               <l>And, prithee, why not give him leave to think?</l>
               <l>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:59613:7"/>
You may indulge with safety all that do,</l>
               <l>There are not many like to trouble you.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Then let each Party lay their Quarrels by,</l>
               <l>Mind their own Trade, and live in Charity.</l>
               <l>We for an Iron-Harvest will prepare,</l>
               <l>And plow for Honour in the Fields of War:</l>
               <l>While you are taught more safe and gentle ways,</l>
               <l>To purchase an Inheritance of Praise:</l>
               <l>But now and then, to vary for Delight,</l>
               <l>Fight you like Poets, we'll like Souldiers write.</l>

            <l>THou say'st thou'rt <hi>Mars</hi>'s Scholar, and 'tis true,</l>
            <l>So far, we own, th'ast giv'n thy self thy due;</l>
            <l>For thou art ev'n as much to learn in Fight</l>
            <l>(Tho' thou dost praise thy Writing) as to write.</l>
            <l>Yet thou art angry, that the World thinks fit</l>
            <l>To brand thy Poems with the want of Wit;</l>
            <l>And, in thy Vindication, writ so ill,</l>
            <l>Y'ave giv'n the World fresh Cause to laugh on still.</l>
            <l>Ev'n <hi>Bessus</hi> has to Courage more Pretence,</l>
            <l>Than you, a <hi>Brother of the Quill,</hi> to Sense:</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:59613:8"/>
For thou hast hitten ev'ry thing so pat,</l>
            <l>No Body knows what 'tis thou wou'd'st be at.</l>
            <l>Write on then, Friend, carp at the Stage and Court,</l>
            <l>Some Authors were created for our Sport,</l>
            <l>And thou art one—who, with such mighty Pains,</l>
            <l>Hast prov'd thou hast large <hi>Ears,</hi> but little <hi>Brains.</hi>

               <l>EASING my Body, t'other Day,</l>
               <l>Or sh—g, as a Man may say,</l>
               <l>My Foot-man brought me in your Rhymes</l>
               <l>(How luckily Things hit sometimes!)</l>
               <l>No Posture could have been so fit</l>
               <l>To deal with such a desp'rate Wit,</l>
               <l>Who is at War with Common Sense,</l>
               <l>And plays the Fool in's own Defence.</l>

               <l>But whilst thou think'st to laugh at me,</l>
               <l>All Men of Judgment smile, to see</l>
               <l>How Nature makes a Jest of Thee,</l>
               <l>In giving thee a Fatal Itch</l>
               <l>To talk of Things above thy Pitch.</l>

By such weak Spight as Thine, we find</l>
               <l>How Heav'n has to the World been kind,</l>
               <l>In tempering the Knave with Fool,</l>

               <l>But thou art blinded with thy Rage,</l>
               <l>I only carp at Sots, like Thee,</l>
               <l>Who are to both an Infamy.</l>
               <l>Thou say'st, I'm vex'd, the World thinks fit</l>
               <l>To brand my Verse with want of Wit:</l>
               <l>Because it happens so to Thee,</l>
               <l>Thou fain would'st turn it upon Me.</l>
               <l>Thy Muse sings hoarse, and out of Time,</l>
               <l>An arrant <hi>Billings-gate</hi> in Rhyme:</l>
               <l>Therefore, when I had read thy Verse,</l>
               <l>In Answer to't, I wip'd—</l>
               <l>And if thy Name thou'lt let me know,</l>
               <l>I'll do so with the Author too.</l>
