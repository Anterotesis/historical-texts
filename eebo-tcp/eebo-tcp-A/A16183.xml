         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>Euerend Sir, and Brother in Chriſt, It is almoſt fortie yeeres ſince we did ſee one the other: But yet I haue ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer beene vnmindfull of our ancient acquaintance, neither haue I ceaſed, ſeeing I could doe you no other good, to commend you, labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring moſt painefully in the Lords vineyard, in my prayers to God: and I doubt not, but that I haue liued all this while in your memorie, and haue had ſome place in your prayers at the Lords Altar. So therefore euen vnto this time we haue abidden, as S. <hi>Iohn</hi> ſpeaketh, in the mutuall loue one of the other, not in worde or letter, but in deede, and trueth. But a late meſſage which was brought vnto vs within a few dayes, of your bonds and impriſonment, hath inforced mee to breake off this ſilence; which meſſage, although it ſeemed heauie in regard of the loſſe of your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorall function which you haue exerciſed in that Church, yet withall it ſeemed ioyous, becauſe you drew neere vnto the glory of <hi>Martyrdome,</hi> then the which thing there is no gift of God more happy; that you, who haue fed your Flocke ſo many yeeres with the word and doctrine, ſhould now feede it more gloriouſly, by the example of your patience. But another heauy tidings did
<pb facs="tcp:22044:10"/>
not a litle diſquiet and almoſt take away this ioy, which immediatly followed, of the aduerſaries aſſault, and peraduenture of the ſlip and fall of your Conſtancie in refuſing an vnlawfull Oath. Neither truely (moſt deare brother) could that oath therefore be lawfull, becauſe it was offered in ſort tempered and modified: for you know that thoſe kind of modifications are nothing els, but ſleights and ſubtilties of Satan, that the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholique faith touching the Primacie of the See Apoſtolike, might either ſecretly or openly bee ſhot at, for the which faith ſo many worthy Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs euen in that very <hi>England</hi> it ſelfe, haue reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted vnto blood. For moſt certaine it is, that in whatſoeuer words the Oath is conceiued by the aduerſaries of the faith in that Kingdome, it tends to this end, that the Authoritie of the head of the Church in <hi>England,</hi> may bee transferred from the ſucceſſour of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> to the Succeſſour of K. <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, For that which is preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the danger of the Kings life, if the ſupreme Biſhop ſhould haue the ſame power in <hi>England,</hi> which he hath in all other Chriſtian Kingdomes: it is altogether idle, as all that haue any vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, may eaſily perceiue. For it was neuer heard of from the Churches infancie vntill this day, that euer any <hi>Pope</hi> did commaund, that any Prince, though an Heretike, though an Ethnike, though a Perſecuter, ſhould be murdered, or did approue of the fact, when it was done by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And why, I pray you, doth onely the King of <hi>England</hi> feare that, which none of all the other
<pb facs="tcp:22044:10"/>
Princes in Chriſtendome either doeth feare, or euer did feare?</p>
               <p>But, as I ſaid, theſe vaine pretexts are but the Trappes and Stratagemes of Sathan: of which kinde, I could produce not a few out of ancient Stories, if I went about to write a booke, and not an Epiſtle. One onely for example ſake, I will call to your memory. S. <hi>Gregorie Nazianzene</hi> in his firſt Oration againſt <hi>Iulian</hi> the Emperour, reporteth, that hee, the more eaſily to beguile the ſimple Chriſtians, did inſert the Images of the falſe gods into the pictures of the Emperour, which the Romanes did vſe to bow downe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to with a ciuill kind of reuerence; ſo that no man could doe reuerence to the Emperours picture, but withall he muſt adore the Images of the falſe gods. Whereupon it came to paſſe, that many were deceiued: and if there were any that found out the Emperours craft, and refuſed to worſhip his picture, thoſe were moſt grieuouſly puniſhed, as men that had contemned the Emperour in his Image. Some ſuch like thing, me thinkes, I ſee in the Oath that is offered to you, which is ſo craftily compoſed, that no man can deteſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon againſt the King, and make profeſsion of his Ciuil ſubiection, but he muſt be conſtrained, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidiouſly to denie the Primacy of the Apoſtolicke See. But the ſeruants of Chriſt, and eſpecially the chiefe Prieſts of the Lord ought to be ſo farre from taking an vnlawfull Oath, where they may indamage their Faith, that they ought to beware that they giue not the leaſt ſuſpicion of diſsimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
<pb facs="tcp:22044:11"/>
that they haue taken it. Which thing that worthy <hi>Eleazar</hi> did moſt notably performe, who would neither eate Swines fleſh, nor ſo much as faine to haue eaten it, although hee ſaw the great torments that did hang ouer his head, leſt, as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe ſpeaketh in the ſecond booke of the <hi>Macca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bees,</hi> many yong men might be brought through that Simulation, to preuaricate with the Law. Neither did <hi>Baſill</hi> the great by his example, which is more fit for our purpoſe, carrie himſelfe leſſe worthily towards <hi>Valens</hi> the Emperour. For, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> writeth in his Hiſtory, when the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putie of that hereticall Emperour did perſwade Saint <hi>Baſill,</hi> that he ſhould not reſiſt the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour for a little Subtiltie of a few points of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine; that moſt holy and prudent man made anſwere, <hi>That it was not to be endured, that the leaſt ſyllable of Gods word ſhould be corrupted, but rather all kinde of torment was to be embraced, for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the Trueth thereof.</hi> Now I ſuppoſe, that there want not amongſt you, who ſay that they are but Subtilties of Opinions, that are conteined in the Oath that is offered to the Catholicks, and that you are not to ſtriue againſt the Kings Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie for ſuch a litle matter. But there are not wanting alſo amongſt you holy men, like vnto <hi>Baſill</hi> the Great, which will openly auow, that the very leaſt ſyllable of Gods Diuine Trueth is not to bee corrupted, though many Torments were to be endured, and death it ſelfe ſet before you. Amongſt whom it is meet, that you ſhould be one, or rather the Standerd-bearer, and Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb facs="tcp:22044:11"/>
to the reſt. And whatſoeuer hath bene the cauſe, that your Conſtancie hath quailed, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be the ſuddennes of your apprehenſion, or the bitterneſſe of your perſecution, or the imbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillitie of your old age: yet we truſt in the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of God, and in your owne long continued vertue, that it will come to paſſe, that as you ſeeme in ſome part to haue imitated the fall of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Marcellinus,</hi> ſo you ſhall happily imitate their valour in recouering your ſtrength, and maintaining the trueth. For if you wil diligently weigh the whole matter with your ſelfe, truely you ſhall ſee it is no ſmall matter that is called in queſtion by this Oath, but one of the principall heads of our faith, and foundations of Catholicke Religion. For heare what your Apoſtle S. <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie</hi> the Great hath written, in his 42. Epiſtle of his 11. booke. <hi>Let not the Reuerence due to the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique See, bee troubled by any mans preſumption: for then the ſtate of the members doeth remaine entire, when the head of the faith is not bruiſedby any iniurie.</hi> Therefore, by S. <hi>Gregories</hi> teſtimonie, when they are buſie about diſturbing or diminiſhing, or ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away of the Primacie of the Apoſtolicke See, then are they buſie about cutting off the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry head of the faith, and diſſoluing of the ſtate of the whole body, and of all the members. Which ſelfe ſame thing S. <hi>Leo</hi> doeth confirme in his third Sermon of his Aſſumption to the <hi>Pope-dome,</hi> when he ſaith, <hi>Our Lord had a ſpeciall care of</hi> Peter, <hi>and praied properly for</hi> Peters <hi>faith, as though the ſtate of others were more ſtable, when their Princes
<pb facs="tcp:22044:12"/>
minde was not to bee ouercome.</hi> Whereupon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe in his Epiſtle to the Biſhops of <hi>Vienna,</hi> doeth not doubt to affirme, <hi>that he is not partaker of the diuine Myſterie, that dare depart from the ſoliditie of</hi> Peter. Who alſo ſaith, <hi>that hee who thinketh the Primacie is to be denied to that See, he can in no ſort leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the Authoritie of it, but by being puft vp with the ſpirit of pride, doeth caſt himſelfe headlong into hell.</hi> Theſe and many other of this kind, I am very ſure are moſt familiar to you: who beſides many other bookes, haue diligently read ouer the <hi>Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Monarchie</hi> of your owne <hi>Saunders,</hi> a moſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent writer, and one who hath worthily deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued of the Church of England. Neither can you be ignorant, that thoſe moſt holy &amp; learned men, <hi>Iohn</hi> B. of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and <hi>Thomas More</hi> within our memorie, for this one moſt weightie head of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, led the way to <hi>Martyrdome</hi> to many others, to the exceeding glory of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation. But I would put you in remembrance, that you ſhould take heart, and conſidering the weightineſſe of the cauſe, not to truſt too much to your owne iudgement, neither be wiſe aboue that is meete to bee wiſe. And if peraduenture your fall haue proceeded not vpon want of conſideration, but through humane infirmitie, and for feare of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, and impriſonment; yet do not preferre a temporal libertie before the libertie of the glory of the Sonnes of God, neither for eſcaping a light and momentarie tribulation, looſe an eternall weight of glory, which tribulation it ſelfe doeth worke in you. You haue fought a good fight a
<pb facs="tcp:22044:12"/>
long time, you haue wel-neere finiſhed your courſe. So many yeeres you haue kept the faith: doe not therefore looſe the reward of ſuch la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: do not depriue your ſelfe of that Crowne of righteouſneſſe which ſo long agone is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for you. Doe not make the faces of ſo many your both brethren and children aſhamed. Vpon you at this time are fixed the eyes of all the Church: yea alſo, you are made a ſpectacle to the world, to Angels, to men: Doe not ſo carie your ſelfe in this your laſt Act, that you leaue no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but laments to your friends, and ioy to your enemies, but rather the contrarie: which we aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuredly hope, and for which wee continually powre forth prayers to God. Diſplay gloriouſly the banner of Faith, and make to reioyce the Church, which you haue made heauie. So ſhall you not onely merit pardon at Gods hands, but a Crowne. Farewell, quite you like a man, and let your heart bee ſtrengthened. From <hi>Rome</hi> the 28. day of September, 1607.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:22044:19"/>
grace, I haue not wauered (that I remember) in the leaſt point, which certainly and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely may appertaine to the ſublime Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and ſupreme authoritie of the See Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicke. As touching the Oath, I confeſſe I haue taken it, but in that ſenſe, which is found approoued in the writings of Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes, and is no way tainted with any ſpot of temeritie. For the ſenſe I relyed on, being thriſe repeated, and by the Magiſtrate accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ſince alſo publiſhed in print, is this: that the ſupreme Biſhop hath not an <hi>Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall</hi> and <hi>Ciuill</hi> power to depoſe <hi>our</hi> King, at his owne pleaſure and <hi>appetite.</hi> Such a power the Catholicke diuines did neuer aſcribe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the moſt holy Succeſſour of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> as the moſt Illuſtrious of worthy memorie <hi>Cardinall Alane,</hi> and other commendable authors haue <note place="margin">Card.

Neither is there cauſe why any man ſhould haue ſo much as the leaſt ſuſpicion, that the ſenſe aforeſaid was admitted by the Magiſtrate, to the intent to deface, or impaire, or deſpoile the dignitie Apoſtolicke. Surely ſuch apprehenſions bred out of iealouſie, are for the moſt part deceitful Maſters, and beget feare, where there is no feare.</p>

But to purſue my intended courſe: that alſo which is deliuered by the moſt Illuſtrious <hi>Cardinall Caietane</hi> in his anſwere to the <hi>Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiens,</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Caietan. tom 1. tract. 1. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiae parte 2. cap. 13.</note> doeth concurre vnto my defence: that <hi>either of theſe points may truely be determined concerning the Pope; both that he hath a ſupreme power in matters temporall, and that he hath not a ſupreme power in matters temporall; becauſe they are both of them true in a right underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. The affirmatiue is true, in order to things ſpirituall; the negatiue is true directly, or as things temporall are conſidered in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. So as there can no errour growe by ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the two deciſions.</hi> Thus ſaith he. And this opinion likewiſe the beſt Catholicke wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters haue inſerted into their bookes: viz. <hi>that the Pope, foraſmuch as hee is but of a finite and</hi>

                  <hi>bounded capacitie, and is many times ignorant of the order and proportion of temporall things, how they may make vnto a ſpirituall end, is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in an abſolute manner to haue dominion ouer temporals, but only after a limited and preſcribed rule, as he is able, according to the meaſure of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane intelligence, to diſcerne how temporals may be auaileable to things ſpirituall.</hi> The ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion doe I finde deliuered by another ſound Catholicke author, in theſe words: <hi>That the
<pb facs="tcp:22044:20"/>
Popes power in Temporals is limited: and that he</hi> 
                  <note place="margin">Ioan. Pedrez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zanus in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſ. ad Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ros.</note> 
                  <hi>may not dispoſe of them, but to a certaine propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is, ſo farre as is neceſſarie for a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall end.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Seeing therefore the Popes power in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals is in this ſort tied and reſtrained; why ſhould we incurre ſo heauie a reproofe, for af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming that the Pope hath not power to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>our</hi> King: in as much as the perturbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Church, and the ouerthrow of the Catholickes with vs, in their goods and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsions, and the indamaging of many ſoules, were thereby like to enſue? Let your Ampli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude heare, not mee, but the defender of your owne aſſertion, againſt the <hi>Venetians,</hi> whoſe words are theſe: <hi>The power of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt</hi>

                  <hi>Biſhop is limited, that it may not diſpoſe of temporals beyond the neceſsity of a ſupernaturall end.</hi> To theſe alſo may be adioyned your moſt excellent Amplitudes own opinion: <hi>In regard of the perſons, the Pope cannot,</hi> as he is Pope, <note place="margin">Ioan. 5. de Rom. Pontif. cap. 6.</note> 
                  <hi>by his.</hi> ordinarie <hi>power, (though there be iust cauſe) depoſe temporall princes, in that manner as hee depoſeth Biſhops, that is, as their ordinarie Iudge: but he may,</hi> as the ſupreme ſpirituall prince, <hi>alter kingdomes, take them from one and giue them to another, if neede ſo require, for the
<pb facs="tcp:22044:20"/>
ſauing of ſoules.</hi> Which wordes doe plainely ſtrengthen our admittance of the Oath. For the words of the oath are, that <hi>the Pope hath not authoritie to depoſe the King, or to diſpoſe any of his Maiesties kingdomes, or dominions.</hi> And the common vnderſtanding doeth with the Magiſtrate encline to no other conceit, then to this: The Pope, <hi>as he is Pope:</hi> for it cannot reach vnto that conſtruction; as he is the <hi>chiefe ſpirituall prince.</hi> And when the oath is propounded to be taken, the ſenſe thereof, apprehended by the Magiſtrate, is reſtrained to an <hi>ordinary</hi> power. For they who exhibite the oath, are as farre as may be from any thought of an <hi>extraordinary</hi> or <hi>indirect</hi> pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, reſiding in the Pope.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if your Amplitudes moſt mild diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition could but in the leaſt part conceiue the ruines of Catholicke families, which the refuſall of this othe would bring vpon vs; aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly you would not diſſent from vs, who by moſt wofull examples doe finde, that from thence were like to proceede, not onely the loſſe and hazard of ſoules, but the lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble extirpation of the whole Catholicke ſtate amongſt vs. Sith therefore wee doe ſenſibly finde, that the authoritie of the ſupreme Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,
<pb facs="tcp:22044:21"/>
touching the depoſition of our King, cannot tende to the promoting of Spirituall matters, but to the ouerthrow of them: why ſhould wee be thus ſhaken vp, as hauing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uolted from the Faith, and denied the Prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie Apoſtolicke, who mainteine nothing, but what is generally concluded on amongſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines?</p>

               <p>I might longer flote in this currant of lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned men, which doth plenteouſly flow out to my defence, concerning the Oath. For who ſo ſhall with an indifferent eye beholde the dangers we are in, would eaſily find, that the power of the ſupreme Biſhop, in the depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>our</hi> King, cannot (as the caſe ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth) tall within the compaſſe of any order, to releiue things ſpirituall, but breaketh forth to the ſuppreſsing of all which hath beene hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto well ſetled in the ſame. Whence it may appeare into how miſerable a condition thoſe ouer-heauie &amp; ſharpe animaduerſions doe caſt me: that <hi>through the ſubtilties of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than I did conſent, that the Primacie of the See Apoſtolicke ſhould bee either openly or couertly ſhot at: that the oath doth in this Realme tend to that end, that the authoritie of the head of the Church, might be transferred in</hi> England <hi>from the Succeſſour of</hi> S. Peter, <hi>vnto the Succeſſour of</hi> Henry 8: <hi>that the faith may hereby be endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered: that I ſeeme to haue in ſome part reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the fal of</hi> S. Peter &amp; S. Marcelline: <hi>that it is not a ſmall matter which by this oath is brought
<pb facs="tcp:22044:22"/>
in danger, but one of the principall heades of our faith, &amp; foundations of Catholicke religion: that I am to heare what</hi> S. Gregorie <hi>the great doth af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme, and what</hi> S. Leo <hi>doth confirme: and to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend what</hi> Sanders <hi>hath deliuered: and that for this one moſt weighty point of doctrine,</hi> Iohn <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of</hi> Rocheſter, <hi>and Sir</hi> Tho. Moore <hi>were leaders vnto others to Martyrdome: that I bee not wiſer, then I ought to bee: and that my ſlip did peraduenture proceede, not from any want of conſideration, but from humane frailtie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things haue I read with attention; bewailing my caſe, that ſuch a heape of cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorious animaduerſions is by you compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted againſt mee, who cannot comprehende or conceiue, how any the leaſt detriment may redound vnto the Primacie of the ſupreme Biſhop, by that ſenſe which I, with the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the Magiſtrate, did propoſe before the taking of mine Oath. But if the words ſeeme not outwardly to yeeld ſo pleaſing a ſound; yet ought not the ſenſe or vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſerue the wordes, but the words the vnderſtanding, as is apparant out of the fiath booke of <hi>Gregories Decretals, de verborum ſignificatione.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Neither can I imagine, how by receiuing
<pb facs="tcp:22044:22"/>
that Oath, there can grow any daunger vnto the faith: the ſame implying nothing, which may ſhadow out ſo much as a reſemblance, or ſhew of any thing, which is formally a point of faith. For, as <hi>Couarruuias, Martinus</hi>

And <hi>Cardinall Allen</hi> of famous memorie ſaith in this cauſe: <hi>It is a meere mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of diuinitie, and of very neere coherence with Chriſtian religion, which although it bee not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aduenture definitely reſolued for our ſide: yet that it may and vſeth to be by Theologicall arguments diſputed on both parts, our aduerſaries, if they know anything, cannot be ignorant.</hi> Thus ſaith hee.

<pb facs="tcp:22044:23"/>
of <hi>our</hi> King, is quite extinguiſhed: and therefore there would bee care had, leſt you procure vnto vs a harder condition, then yet we are in. And to ſay truth, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding <hi>Boniface</hi> his definition, the King of <hi>France</hi> (as is euident by the inſuing declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Clement)</hi> did not loſe any part of his <note place="margin">Clemens de pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uileg. cap. <hi>Mcruit.</hi>

                  <hi>Pariſiens</hi> viz: That <hi>it was one thing to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> de fide, formaliter, <hi>and another to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> de eo quod eſt fidei, materialiter. <hi>For the former doth import, the determining of what is to be beleeued, or not to be beleeued: but the latter, the deciding of questions which happen in things beleeued: and it is cleare, that when any queſtion is determined, after the ſecond manner, it is not ſaid to be a determination touching faith, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ſuch or ſuch a matter. When therefore it is ſaid, that the Pope cannot erre in a iudgement of faith; I doe not take it to bee ſpoken, but of a iudgement of faith formally, that is, when he determineth, what is to be beleeued, or not to be
<pb facs="tcp:22044:23"/>
beleeued.</hi> Thus ſaith he.</p>
               <p>Out of which words I (ſubmitting my ſelfe vnto your moſt exquiſite iudgement) doe col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, that if it were defined, as a point of faith <hi>formally,</hi> that the Pope hath power to depoſe kings <hi>indirectly,</hi> that is, in order to things ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall; vndoubtedly all men were by ſuch a definition <hi>in theſi,</hi> in the generall poſition, bound firmely to beleeue it. But if the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on were propounded <hi>in hypotheſi,</hi> that is, in the particular ſuppoſition, whether the Pope hath power to depoſe <hi>our</hi> king, matters conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing with vs in the ſtate they now are in; ſurely me thinketh (ſauing the iudgement of ſharper wits) that the determination of this queſtion were of a matter which is of faith <hi>materially,</hi> it being the deciſion of a doubt, which happeneth in things beleeued, and were not therfore to be called a determination concerning faith, but touching ſuch or ſuch a matter: but it is a deciſion touching a point of faith formally, which blindeth vs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue it. Now therefore I, being humbly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate at the ſincerity of your moſt vpright iudgement, doe earneſtly beſeech your Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plitude, to iudge whether I haue ſtaggered in any matter, which is a point of faith <hi>formally,</hi>

               <p>I doe therefore very humbly intreate your Amplitude, that theſe ſo grieuous imputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt me, wrought with threedes of an vnſuting colour, may be cut aſunder, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh into ſmoke.

their duties of obedience from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, neither taught nor put in practiſe any courſe of diſobedience, nor bare armes againſt them, though (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith) they had ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <note place="margin">Tertull in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polog. cap. 37.</note> force ſo to haue done: he this Examinate doeth greatly approoue ſuch their dutifull obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; affirming, that in his iudgement they had ſinned mortally, if they had done otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5 That euen in the caſe of <hi>Iulian</hi> (who, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing firſt embraced the Goſpel, became after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards an <hi>Apoſtata)</hi> the godly Biſhops, Fathers, and Chriſtians in thoſe times, although ſome writ bitterly againſt him, yet they did not excite his Subiects to beare armes againſt him, nor did themſelues enter into any rebellion: either of which courſes, if they had attempted, this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate thinketh (as before) that they had greatly offended God, and broken the precepts of Chriſt and his Apoſtles: adding, that therein he ioyned with S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> where he ſpeaketh of the duty <note place="margin">Augustine in Pſal. 124.</note> which Chriſtians performed to <hi>Iulian,</hi> though he were an Apoſtata: <hi>Iulianus extitit infidelis Impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.

               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:22044:27"/>
That is, <hi>Iulian was an vnbeleeuing Emperour. Was hee not an Apoſtata, an oppreſſour, and an Idolater?

            <p n="8">8 It is well knowen (ſaith he) to all that be learned, and will be graunted without any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction, that the Pope may not proceede with Princes, otherwiſe then is behoouefull for the Church.

Out of which the premiſſes (being well conſidered) this Examinate ſaith, that the State of ENGLAND weighed, as now it is, if the <hi>Pope</hi> vpon any inſtigation ſhould excommunicate his Maieſtie, depoſe him from his Crowne, releaſe his Subiects from their obedience, and command them vnder paine of Excommunication to beare armes againſt him, &amp;c. although he the ſaid <hi>Pope</hi> were perſwaded, that ſuch his proceedings and commandements were iuſt: yet foraſmuch as the Catholickes here in England of any vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, might eaſily perceiue and diſcerne, that ſuch an Excommunication ſhould <hi>ſapere pecca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum,</hi> or might vehemently be ſuſpected, that it would procure a great perturbation of the ſtate of the Church, or produce ſome other euill, or future ſcandall; and that the execution of it would bring with it (by preſumption) a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment or ſcandall to the ſoules or bodies of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes:
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:22044:29"/>
they were not bound in thoſe caſes, to regard the ſaid Excommunication, or any thing therein contained, at the leaſt, to put the ſame in execution: it being a generall and a true rule, that <hi>Peters</hi> power was giuen him onely, <hi>ad aedificatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi> to edification: <hi>quod alijs verbes ſolet dici, claue non errante:</hi> which in other words is vſually ſaid, <hi>the key not erring,</hi> as <hi>Salmeron</hi> hath well obſerued: for as he further ſaith, <hi>if it be vſed in deſtructionem,</hi>

In the meane time it being demanded of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminate, why he himſelfe, at the time that he tooke the ſaid oath, did ſeeme to relie vpon his Maieſties ſpeeches, deliuered in <hi>Parliament</hi> 19. of <hi>May</hi> 1603: whereas he had before taught the Romiſh Catholicks, and ſent his reaſons to <hi>Rome</hi> to that end, to prooue it to be lawfull for them to take that oath, without any ſuch reference to his Maieſties ſpeaches: he anſwering ſaith, 1. that before hee euer reſolued any Catholicke of the lawfulneſſe of that oath, he had heard of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties ſayd ſpeaches, though he did not alledge and ſpecifie them to any, before he came him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to take that oath. 2. that at his owne ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the oath, he did in part relye vpon them, and ſo profeſſed, becauſe he ſuppoſed, that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he ſhould ſtay ſome mens ouer haſtie, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate conceits of his taking that oath, and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:22044:30"/>
their opinions of his meaning therein, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeing what great oppoſition was like to be made againſt him (as he touched in his ſixth Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation already in print) for yeelding thereunto, eſpecially after the diuulging of the Popes firſt <hi>Breue,</hi> and ſome other letters, aduiſing all Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks to the contrary. 3. that being in priſon, he thought it his beſt courſe (if he could) both to ſatiſfie the State, and to content the Catholicks; which made him to take hold of any fit occaſion, that might auaile him to that end, doing nothing therein againſt the trueth, though he concealed by that meanes ſome part of it, which now hee perceiueth will bee drawen from him, to ſome mens diſlike he feareth, but (as he hopeth) to Gods glory, the diſcharge of his conſcience, and the good of all graue and moderate Catholicks.</p>
            <p n="14">14. Here, vpon occaſion, becauſe this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate found, that it was aſcribed vnto him, as a fault, in that he being a priſoner ſhould write to a man of <hi>Cardinall Bellarmines</hi> ranke, without no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice firſt giuen thereof to the State: he was very earneſt, before any more queſtions were deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him, that he might haue licenſe to deliuer his mind in that behalfe. Which being yeelded vnto, he ſayth: that being charged by the <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> to haue in a ſort denied the Popes <hi>Supremacy,</hi> in that he tooke the oath of <hi>Allegeance:</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing certaine places vrged againſt him to that purpoſe out of <hi>Leo</hi> and Saint <hi>Gregorie:</hi> foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as he this Examinate perceiueth thereby,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:22044:31"/>
that the ſaid <hi>Cardinall</hi> did not diſtinguiſh betwixt the oath of the Kings <hi>Supremacy</hi> (ſo termed) made 1. <hi>Eliz.</hi> and the oath of <hi>Allegeanee</hi> ſet out 3. of his Maieſtie; the firſt being ordeined for the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing altogether of the authoritie in cauſes Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſticall, out of this Realme, and the ſecond, without any relation at all to the former, onely ſeeking to preuent certaine inferences therein mentioned, which were ſuppoſed might enſue, by vertue of an Excommunication, and did tend to the great hazard, and endangering of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſties perſon (as it is ſuppoſed) and to the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leading and ouerthrow of many of his Subiects: hee this Examinate thought himſelfe bound in conſcience to write an anſwere to the ſaid <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall,</hi> as well for the clearing of himſelfe in that point (he being readie, if he had twentie liues, to yeeld them all in defence of the Popes <hi>ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall) as alſo for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of ſo great a perſon, for whoſe hard opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of him he would be right ſorie. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore touching his fact herein, if it be thought amiſſe of, he humbly craueth pardon.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Now as concerning the inſufficiencie of this Examinates anſwere, touching his reaſons ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> for the lawfulneſſe of taking the oath of Allegeance, conſiſting of the Popes <hi>hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane intelligence</hi> ſubiect to errour, <hi>Sylueſters</hi> reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, how no ſuch courſe, as is pretended in the oath of Allegeance could bee vndertaken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Maieſtie by the Pope, (the preſent ſtate
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:22044:31"/>
of England conſidered) becauſe the ſame ſhould tend, not to <hi>edification</hi> but to <hi>deſtruction:</hi> it was told this Examinate, that all theſe points ſo well by him enlarged, did come farre ſhort of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſaid oath: becauſe it is very vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, what the Romiſh Catholickes in England would doe, if the Pope ſhould <hi>de facto</hi> proceede with his Maieſtie, as ſome of his predeceſſours did with the late Queene of worthy memorie; which vncertaintie the State may not endure. For although the wiſer, and more prouident ſort of Romiſh Catholickes might in that caſe for a time draw backe: yet what the ſeduced multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude were like enough to doe, if they were able; that is to be foreſeene and prouided for. Beſides, it may well be doubted, what the ſaid tempoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers would doe, if a fit opportunitie ferued them. Moreouer, of what force this conceite was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraine the late moſt horrible Traitours, <hi>Catesby, Garnet,</hi> and the reſt, from their moſt barbarous and ſauage deſignements, it is apparant. It is the trueth without colour, that muſt either direct mens conſciences, or elſe it is but daubing with vntempered morter: nothing but miſchiefe is to bee expected from them. Howbeit ſuppoſe the beſt of this deuiſe and euaſion. If the Pope well aſsiſted, did account and determine any extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitie to be vndertaken againſt his Maieſtie, to be <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> it is more then probable, that his word and iudgement would bee rather accepted of by the greater number, then that pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:22044:32"/>
mens exceptions and limitations would at ſuch a time be able to preuaile, or be of any mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For the preuenting of all which kind of miſchiefes, it is moſt apparant, that amongſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſpects for the preſeruation of his Maieſtie and the State, the ſaid oath (vpon the ſaid moſt barbarous occaſion, that euer was giuen to any King, either heathen or Chriſtian) was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deined.</p>
            <p n="16">16 And therefore this Examinat being here required, that for the better contentment of the State in whoſe hands hee is, and for the trueth ſake, wherewith God is honoured, he ſhould o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen his minde ſimply and plainely, why in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> he telleth him, that he tooke the oath in this ſenſe: <hi>Summum Pontificem non habere</hi> Imperialem <hi>&amp;</hi> Ciuilem <hi>poteſtatem</hi> ad libi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, <hi>&amp; ex ſuo</hi> appetitu <hi>deponendi Regem</hi> noſtrum: That the Pope hath not an <hi>Imperiall</hi> and <hi>Ciuill</hi> power, to depoſe <hi>our</hi> King, when he <hi>pleaſeth,</hi> and at his owne <hi>appetite:</hi> ſuggeſting, that the ſaid oath had no other meaning: and that this ſenſe was thrice inſiſted vpon (before hee this Examinat tooke the ſaid oath) and allowed of by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate: whereas the words of the oath (which he this Examinat tooke, for ought that appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the contrarie, without any equiuocation, or mentall euaſion whatſoeuer) are cleare and manifeſt, viz. <hi>That the Pope neither of himſelfe, nor by any authoritie of the Church or See of Rome, hath any power or authoritie to depoſe the King.</hi> The oath
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:22044:32"/>
ſaith, that the Pope hath no power by <hi>any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie</hi> of the Church or See of <hi>Rome,</hi> viz: neither <hi>Imperiall, Ciuill,</hi> nor <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> whereas this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminat telleth the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> that he onely ſware againſt his <hi>Imperiall,</hi> and <hi>Ciuill</hi> power, whereby he might not ſo proceede with his Maieſtie.</p>
            <p n="17">17. With theſe particular exceptions, this Examinate being ſomewhat troubled, deſired a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, that before he came to the anſwering of them, he might a little (as by the way) bewayle himſelfe, and his preſent eſtate: which he did in manner as followeth, ſaying:</p>
            <p>That it was no little griefe vnto him to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended, and caſt into priſon; that thereupon he hoped his former troubles and oppoſitions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him would haue ceaſed: that notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, as matters are proſecuted, and his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings interpreted, hee receiueth nothing but diſcomfort from each ſide: that his friendes might haue bene content, to haue expounded his oath in the beſt part, and the rather, becauſe they perceiued hee found thereby, that he had giuen ſome reaſonable contentme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to the State, for the eaſe of his impriſonment (being an old man, and troubled with many bodily infirmities) and for the auoyding of ſome further extremities: that <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> might well haue forborne his Letter vnto him. as alſo his ſharpe cenſures of him, as if by taking the ſaid oath hee had fallen with <hi>Peter,</hi> in denying his Maſter, and with <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellinus,</hi> who offered a falſe ſacrifice, and that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:22044:33"/>
thereby he this Examinate had <hi>brought in queſtion one of the chiefe heads of faith, and foundations of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke religion:</hi> that hee the ſaid <hi>Cardinall</hi> might eaſily haue foreſeene, that albeit there had beene no copies of his Letter taken, before it came to him this Examinate, yet that ſuch a vigilant eye is had ouer him in priſon, as that it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſsible for him to haue kept it vndiſcouered, eſpecially there being ſuch bruites of it caſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, as there were, euen by thoſe that ſhould haue concealed it: that likewiſe the ſaid <hi>Cardinall</hi> might not onely well haue thought, that if it happened his Letter to be diuulged, more hurt then good was likely thereof to enſue, except he thought it fit to bring him (this Examinate) into greater hatred, then he was before (which could not auaile the common cauſe) and to prouoke his Maieſtie to ſome greater extremities, then of his moſt milde and temperate diſpoſition he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined vnto; but likewiſe that it was his this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates part in all duety to anſwere his Letter, which would be alſo (as it hath now fallen out) as impoſsible (his caſe conſidered) for him this Examinate to performe with any ſecrecie, as it was, that his the ſaid <hi>Cardinals</hi> Letter ſhould come vndiſcryed vnto this Examinate: that as hee greatly ſuſpecteth, the <hi>Cardinals</hi> ſaid Letter was cunningly opened, before it came to his this Examinates hands; ſo he is perſwaded, that his anſwere vnto it will be vſed in the like ſort, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it come to the <hi>Cardinall:</hi> and the rather he ſo

thinketh, for that he findeth alreadie the copie of it by skill and practiſe, to be as ſoone publiſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad here in <hi>England,</hi> as this Examinate could diſpatch it for <hi>Rome;</hi> which doth greatly perplexe him, and what may be the iſſue of it, he knoweth not, but feareth (as he ſaith) the worſt at al hands: that notwithſtanding, come what ſhall come, his hopes being paſt (which were neuer great) his libertie reſtrained, (neuer to be recouered) the graue expecting him (which he moſt deſireth) no ioyes, nor comforts but in his bleſſed Sauiour, he is reſolued with patience to expect and vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe it: that theſe and many other ſuch courſes held with him, do oftentimes exceedingly grieue and trouble him, in that men abroad and at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertie, haue no more care of poore men, impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned for thoſe cauſes, which they would ſeeme moſt earneſtly to affect: and that thus hauing eaſed a litle his heart, and referring himſelfe, and his cauſe to God, he will now addreſſe himſelfe to anſwere all the partes of the obiection aboue mentioned, ſyncerely and truely from the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of his heart, as becommeth a true Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke prieſt, and as he is perſwaded in his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, without any equiuocation, or euaſion, and without regard or feare of any mens perſons, or of any inconuenience, or further danger, that might thereby enſue vnto him, or of any ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous imputations, which he doth eaſily foreſee will be heaped vpon him, of purpoſe to diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite both him, and that which he findeth he muſt

needes acknowledge, except he ſhould wilfully denie the trueth, or ſhew himſelfe obſtinate and peruerſe againſt lawfull authority, which his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent eſtate, and conſcience will not permit.</p>

            <p n="20">20 And as concerning his relying vpon his Maieſties words, <hi>in the ſenſe, approoued by the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,</hi> when he this Examinate tooke the oath of Allegeance, and inſinuating to <hi>Cardinall Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine,</hi> that the ſumme of it was accordingly: <hi>Summum Pontificem non habere</hi> Imperialem <hi>&amp;</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uilem <hi>poteſtatem ad</hi> libitum, <hi>&amp; ex ſuo</hi> appetitu <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponendi Regem</hi> noſtrum: that the Pope hath not an <hi>Imperiall</hi> and <hi>ciuill</hi> power to depoſe <hi>our</hi> King, when he <hi>pleaſeth,</hi> and at his owne <hi>appetite:</hi> he ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth likewiſe to giue therein ſome reaſonable contentment.

            <p n="33">33 With the offring of theſe ſpeeches to this Examinates conſideration, he was much offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſaying, that now he perceiueth, it is more ſought to bring him into hatred, then to make proofe of his true Allegeance: becauſe theſe things are onely produced in ſcorne of his Hol. (as he conceiueth) in defence of whoſe <hi>Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi> in ſpirituall cauſes, he is readie to yeeld his life: and therefore anſwered plainely, that he thought himſelfe very hardly dealt with in this point. But reply being made, that his ſaid offence taken, and diſcontentment thereupon vttered ſeemed very ſtrange, how it was come to paſſe with him, that thoſe things which are publiſhed to the world by ſo many, and with ſo great an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation in <hi>Rome,</hi> to no other end, but that all the world ſhould take notice of them, ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet and trouble him, by the very repetition of them.</p>
            <p n="34">34 Wherunto this Examinate ſaith, that the repeating of the ſaid ſpeaches doeth not ſo much moue him, as the drift whereat they aime. For if that which is ſufficient might giue contentment, (theſe ſpeaches, produced out of the authors by him cited, agreeing in effect, with that which he himſelfe had alledged out of them) he did before declare his opinion of them; when hee termed them, <hi>the long-ſince diſliked and impugned aſſertions of the Canoniſts:</hi> and more (he ſaith) by the offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:22044:42"/>
of them to his conſideration, cannot well be required of him, it being no way apperteining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny more vnto him, to cenſure the flatterers of the Pope, then of Kings and Princes, who to pleaſe them, doe oftentimes no doubt ſay more then is true. Whereupon he addeth, that whatſoeuer he did cite out of the ſaid authors, he did it with much griefe, and would not ſo farre haue enlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged himſelfe therein, had he not conceiued, that his Maieſtie had an eſpeciall reſpect vnto this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of the Popes direct authoritie <hi>in tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus,</hi> ſo highly aduanced aboue all kings and Emperours, when hee vſed in <hi>Parliament</hi> theſe wordes in effect: viz. <hi>that by the doctrine of the Popes ſupremacie he</hi> (the ſaid Pope) <hi>doth not onely claime to be ſpirituall head of all Chriſtians, but alſo to haue an</hi> Imperiall Ciuill <hi>power ouer all Kings and Emperours, dethroning and decrowning princes with his foote,</hi> as pleaſeth him, <hi>and diſpenſing and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of all kingdomes and Empires</hi> at his appetite: <hi>and that another point, which they</hi> (meaning the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks) <hi>obſerue in continuall practiſe, is the aſſaſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates and murthers of kings, thinking it no ſinne, but rather a matter of ſaluation, to doe all actions of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion and hoſtilitie againſt their naturall Soueraigne Lord, if he be once curſed, his ſubiects diſcharged of their fidelitie, and his kingdome giuen a praye to their three crowned Monarch.</hi> Through the which his Maieſties ſpeach, this Examinate did verily think, that the oath of Allegeance was ordeined, to meete with ſuch miſchiefes, as the <hi>Parliament</hi>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:22044:42"/>
ſuppoſed (according to his Maieſties ſaid words) to be dangerous conſequences of this forenamed opinion: which hee this Examinate ſignified, when hee tooke that oath, and mentioned (as is aforeſaid) in his letter to the <hi>Cardinall.</hi> Wherein he ſeeth not (as he ſaith) what iuſt offence can be taken, in that he told the <hi>Cardinall,</hi> how he had ſworne, that the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> had no <hi>Imperiall</hi> and <hi>Ciuil</hi> power, to depoſe <hi>at his pleaſure</hi> the kings Maieſtie. For as he then ſware, ſo he doth now conſtantly affirme, that he holdeth the opinion before ſpoken of, concerning the Popes direct Dominion, and ſupreme authoritie ouer all the world <hi>in temperalibus,</hi> to be vntrue, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the peremptory reſolution, and vehemency ſhewed by the authors of it, affirming (but falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) that it is the more common opinion of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines, to be held by the law of God <hi>cum recta fide,</hi> with a right faith.</p>
            <p n="35">35 But here it being obiected, that although the ſaid oath was framed to meete with the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion before by him mentioned; yet that this his reſtraining of it thereunto, doeth not attaine to that, which he knew was intended by it. For in his ſaid letter to the Cardinall he doth cite ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry authors, which ſpeake of another kinde of authoritie, aſcribed to the Pope, and tending by a nice diſtinction to this effect: that <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> in order to things ſpirituall, and <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly</hi> all kings and princes, with their kingdomes and countries, are ſubordinate, and ſubiect vnto
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:22044:43"/>
him; inſomuch as if he ſee cauſe, and that kings and princes will not be aduiſed by him, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Church apperteining to their ſaluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he may not onely Excommunicate them, but proceeding by degrees, depoſe them, abſolue their ſubiects from their oathes of Allegeance, and rightfully commaund them (if neede be) to beare armes againſt them: which is as lewd and traiterous an opinion, as the former, and doeth tend to the ſame end with it, though vnder diuers pretences. So as if hee tooke the oath, but with relation onely to the firſt opinion, leauing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe free as touching the ſecond, it was all one, as if he had not taken it at all: and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſſed to cleare this point, he anſwereth, as hereafter followeth.</p>
            <p n="36">36 Firſt, he doth acknowledge the obiection to be very pertinent, and rightly collected out of his letter, confeſsing this ſecond opinion, not to come behinde the firſt, either for the earneſtneſſe of thoſe, that defend it, or for their learning and ſufficiencie, being ſuch indeede, as doe in credite farre ouerſway the eſtimation of their oppoſites. <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> himſelfe hath laboured much in it, and theſe authors following doe ioyne with him in that point, <hi>Henricus, Iohannes Driedo, Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannes de Turre crematâ, Albertus Pighius, Thomas Waldenſis, Petrus de Palude, Cardinall Caietane, Franciſcus Victoria, Dominicus Soto, Nicolaus San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derus:</hi> to which number this Examinate ſaith, he could adde diuers others, as <hi>Martinus Aſpilcueta,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:22044:43"/>
Couarruuias, &amp;c.</hi> Of which opinion Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, that it is <hi>communis ſententia Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licorum Theologorum:</hi> the common opinion of Catholicke Diuines: albeit <hi>Alexander Carerius,</hi> and <hi>Rodericke Sancius</hi> doe affirme as much for the other. In this number, this Examinate confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that he did range himſelfe in his late letter to the ſaid <hi>Cardinall,</hi> as inclining rather to his ſide, then to the other: being notwithſtanding bound to neither of them, vpon any danger of declining from the Catholicke faith. So as if now hee vſe his libertie therein as touching his Maieſtie, hee hath (as he ſuppoſeth) Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe for his author therein.</p>
            <p n="37">37 For where there is this clauſe in the oath of Allegeance, <hi>I doe further ſweare, that I doe from my heart deteſt and abiure, as impious and hereticall, this damnable doctrine and poſition; that Princes which be excommunicated or depriued by the Pope, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, or murthered by their Subiects, or any other whatſoeuer:</hi> Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſaith, that it was neuer heard of <hi>ab intio naſcentis Eccleſiae vſque ad haec noſtra tempora, vt vllus Pontifex Maximus Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipem vllum quamuis haereticum, quamuis Ethnicum, quamuis perſecutorem caedi mandauerit:</hi> from the firſt birth of the Church, vnto theſe our times, that any Pope euer commaunded any prince, though an heretick, though an Ethnicke, though a perſecuter, to be ſlaine: And that therefore the feare which is pretended of the Kings life (if the Biſhop of Rome had the ſame authoritie in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:22044:44"/>
which hee hath in other Chriſtian king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes) is vaine, and that all pretences tending that way, are but <hi>ſtratagemata Satanae,</hi> the deceits of Sathan. The which affirmations of the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinals</hi> being true, the ſame for ought this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſeeth, doe iuſtifie the ſaid part of the oath by him taken, euen the very ſame, which of all other parts in it, is moſt miſliked by many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes in England. For it muſt needs be gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted generally, that were it not in reſpect of the Popes excommunication of Kings and princes, his depoſing of them from their Crownes, and his abſoluing of their ſubiects from their Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, it could neuer be lawfull for any of them to riſe vp againſt their lawfull kings and Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes vnder whom they were borne. And it is all one (in this Examinats iudgment) for the Pope to command a king to be murthered, as to doe, and commaund that, whereby the ſame is by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of duetie to be effected. And then it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth out of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> words, that it can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer be lawfull by the Popes authoritie, either <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect</hi> or <hi>indirect,</hi> for any ſubiect (vpon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence whatſoeuer, or vnder the countenance of any authoritie, to excommunicate, and depoſe Kings, or abſolue their Subiects from their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance) to lay violent hands vpon his Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigne, which is in effect that part of the oath a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue mentioned, whereunto this Examinate did ſweare.</p>
            <p n="38">38 Furthermore, becauſe it was againe tolde
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:22044:44"/>
this Examinate, that this his laſt anſwere to part of the ſaid oath, ſtood after a ſort but vpon an inference of the <hi>Cardinals</hi> meaning, and was no way ſufficient to ſatisfie the aforeſaid obiection; hee this Examinate renued his former deſire of proceeding by ſuch degrees, as hee himſelfe thought moſt fit, for the diſcharge of his duety both to God and his Maieſtie: and thereupon ſaith; that he beleeueth in his conſcience, that the Pope is S. <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſour, and the head of the Catholick Church: and that although materiall and worldly keyes may open and ſhut, vpon fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour and friendſhip; yet the keyes of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of heauen doe reſpect no mens perſons, be they poore or rich, noble or ignoble, high or low, kings or ſubiects: ſo as in his iudgement none may be exempted from the Popes Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication, when there is iuſt cauſe (vpon due conſideration of all circumſtances) to inflict it: adding thereunto, that hee holdeth it to be the duety of all Chriſtian kings and princes, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelues in cauſes of religion to the Biſhop of Rome, as vnto their chiefe Biſhop and Paſtor of their ſoules. Which profeſsion thus made, this Examinate deſired, that one point in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Examination publiſhed in print, might here be receiued, as part of his anſwere to the obiecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on aboue ſpecified.

            <p n="39">39 For there this Examinat (as he truly ſaith) <note place="margin">M Blakwels Exam. pag. 18, 19.</note> 
               <hi>Being vrged to explicate himſelfe, touching the ſence he relied vpon, out of his Maieſties words,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:22044:45"/>
when he took the oth of Allegeance,</hi> in that it was ſaid, <hi>hee might ſo vnderſtand them, as not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his oath, that dutie which was expected, was no way ſatisfied: becauſe his Maieſties mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was euident, that hee did account it to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from</hi> appetite <hi>and raſhneſſe in any of the Biſhops of</hi> Rome <hi>whoſoeuer, who preſuming to Excommunicate any King, ſhould by the ſame either abſolue his Subiects from their obedience, or excite them to beare Armes againſt him, or authorize them to lay violent hands vpon his perſon, or to ſtirre vp any ſedition or tumult with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in his Kingdom, or to aſsiſt any that ſhould make ſuch attempts either againſt the King, or the State of the Kingdome:</hi> he this Examinate an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwereth now, as he anſwered then <hi>for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther opening of his meaning, ſaying, his iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is, that no lawfull Excommunication (ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med either</hi> Excommunicatio maior, <hi>the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Excommunication, or Eccleſiaſticall curſe of</hi> Anathematization) <hi>can produce ſuch effects, or ought to enforce the ſame;</hi> and that hee agreeth therein with many ſound Catholike writers (as he thinketh) and particularly with theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: and ſo drawing out his pocket-notes (as oft, vpon ſundry occaſions he did) hee cauſed their words to bee ſet downe for the better declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

            <p n="44">44 Whereupon this Examinate at the laſt (though he was hardly drawen vnto it, in reſpect of the perſons, whoſe wordes were cited, much honoured and reuerenced by him) did giue this anſwere, ſaying in effect, as he did concerning the authors whoſe aſſertions were propounded vnto him in the next precedent obiection, viz. That theſe men had their particular opinions, as hee hath his; but confeſſeth that theſe their aſſertions laſt mentioned are farre from his iudgement, vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly denying them to bee the inferences of the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:22044:48"/>
ſchoole of all Diuines, and Eccleſiaſticall Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yeers, or that they are either <hi>de fide</hi> of faith, or cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, or defined, or the vndoubted opinions of the moſt learned men, agreeable to the doctrine of the Apoſtles. Beſides, whatſoeuer this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate hath formerly ſaid touching his reaſons ſent to <hi>Rome,</hi> or out of <hi>Sylueſter,</hi> or touching the preſent eſtate of this Kingdome, or his former iudgement, that an Excommunication cannot warrant any ſuch kinde of proceedings of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects againſt their Princes (be they Hereticks or Apoſtates, or whatſoeuer they be) doth iuſtle di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly with theſe aſſertions: and therefore hee ſaith, that hee doth vtterly reiect them, accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them great ſtaines and blemiſhes vnto Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication, if they bee made the effectes thereof.</p>
            <p n="45">45 Here it falling out aptly to come to the point indeed (mentioned <hi>Sect. 35.)</hi> the ſame was preſſed. For whereas it is cleare by this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates confeſsion, that they of the Romiſh church haue not onely amongſt them Excommunicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Princes, but likewiſe (as hee hath before ſhewed out of certaine their authenticall writers) an Eradication and vtter extirpation, which muſt (as it appeareth) be effected not by Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but by vertue of the Popes authority, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he is <hi>directly Dominus Temporalium,</hi> that is, the chiefe Temporall Lord vnder Chriſt ouer all the world, or <hi>indirectly, in ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> in order to things ſpirituall: foraſmuch as both of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:22044:49"/>
them doe tend to one end, and are equally perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and trayterous to all Regall Principalitie and authoritie; it being litle to the purpoſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from Excommunication, that it hath no power to depoſe kings, or to abſolue their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects from their Allegeance, if there be left in the Pope another kinde of power, after that by his Excommunication he hath caſt kings to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill (in his owne idle conceit) then to eradicate them likewiſe and throw them out of their king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, and to authorize and incite their ſubiects to all ſecret conſpiracies, treaſons, rebellions and trecheries againſt their Soueraignes: this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate was heere againe vrged vpon his allege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to his Maieſtie, and as there was any trueth to bee expected at his hands, to ſet downe his iudgement, touching this point of the Popes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Soueraigne power <hi>in Temporalibus, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> in order to things ſpirituall, as he hath done before, concerning the other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his <hi>direct</hi> authoritie.</p>
            <p n="46">46 With this point this Examinate (as it ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med) being much perplexed ſaid, that now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the matter was followed to the quicke: and therefore deſired that it might be ſufficient for him to acknowledge, that in his iudgement the Pope hath authoritie to Excommunicate (when there is cauſe) the greateſt King in the world, profeſing Chriſtianitie; but (ſayth hee) for his other power, <hi>in ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> in order to things ſpirituall, it cannot touch his Maieſtie.</p>

47 Hereupon, for that this Examinate had often before deſired, that hee might ſpeake of things by degrees &amp; not in groſſe, it was thought fit to proceed herein with him accordingly.

will now at the laſt vſe that his libertie at this time, becauſe hee doeth finde it to be as lawfull for him to refuſe the one as the other: and doeth thereupon accordingly profeſſe with all trueth and ſinceritie, that (as he thinketh) neither of the ſaid opinions is true: that what he this Examinate hath before ſet downe at large out of Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> he thinketh in his conſcience is ſound and Catholicke, and cannot be impeached either by the <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> and thoſe their aſsiſtants, that lately haue taken their parts ſo eagerly, for the Popes <hi>direct</hi> power, or by the other ſide, who to the ſame end for his dealing with Emperours, Kings, and Princes, as is aforeſaid, doe attribute the ſame vnto him, though <hi>indirectly:</hi> and that he is the bolder in this ſort to declare his minde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſaid two oppoſite opinions, becauſe it is not yet defined (as hee hath ſaid) by the Church, whether Chriſt hath left to the Pope any ſuch authoritie at all, to eradicate and depoſe Emperors and Kings, as they contend for prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterouſly, in labouring (before it be reſolued whether hee hath any ſuch authoritie, or not) to perſwade men in what maner the ſame was giuen vnto him, <hi>directly</hi> ſaith the one ſide, <hi>indirectly</hi> ſaith the other.</p>

that is, bee pretended to bee vndertaken for the good of the Church, and promoting of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie: the ſame in this Examinats iudgement (as hee ſaith) being neither Apoſtolicall, nor agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the practiſe of the moſt worthy Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> in the Primitiue Church, and for a long time after, nor auaileable in truth to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church, but rather hurtfull, and great hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derances thereunto.</p>
            <p n="76">76 And here this Examinate further ſaieth, that the premiſſes conſidered, viz: vpon what vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties the maintenance of the Popes autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie, not to excommunicate, but to depoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, doth conſiſt: hee confeſſeth that hee cannot chuſe but acknowledge, that he much wondreth, and in that cogitation is alſo exceedingly grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, that euer <hi>Gregorie</hi> the ſeuenth, or any Pope ſince did in their Excommunications of certaine Emperours, Kings and Princes, take vpon them in the ſame, to denounce them depoſed from their kingdomes, to releaſe their Subiects of the othes of their Allegeance, and to authorize them no longer to obey their Soueraignes, vnder paine of Excommunication: as alſo that many men, aſwell Emperours, Kings, Princes, and their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects haue thereby receiued great detriment, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſubiects, who haue ſpent their liues, as ſuppoſing the cauſe was iuſt, which they vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke, this in the meane while being indeed their caſe, that as what they did therein, was in truth wicked, and rebellious, ſo when either that,

which they took in hand had not good ſucceſſe, or when afterwards the Pope and ſuch Princes grew to an agreement, they were euer for the moſt part reputed (according to their deſerts) for Rebels and Traitours, vnder pretence of ſome thing or other, that was amiſſe in their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings: and that therefore he hopeth, that in time all Catholickes will hereafter by other mens harmes learne to beware, and not bee drawen to any diſobedience againſt their Soueraignes vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any pretence whatſoeuer.</p>
            <p n="77">77 The authours of the late moſt wicked, and barbarous treaſon, commonly termed the <hi>Gun-powder treaſon,</hi> had (as this Examinate verily thin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth) ſome intendment to haue aduanced there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Catholicke cauſe: for that his Maieſtie did ſtill perſiſt in the ſame courſe, which was held by the late Queene his predeceſſor, or by what other inducements, this Examinate knoweth not.

            <p n="82">82 That hee alſo doeth beleeue, and is in his conſcience reſolued, that neither the Pope, nor any perſon whatſoeuer, hath power to abſolue him of this oath, or of any part thereof, whereby he might truely thinke himſelfe diſcharged in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one point of his Allegeance before by him profeſſed: and that therefore hee doeth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce all Pardons and Diſpenſations in that behalfe.</p>

            <p n="85">85 That hee did not imagine any ſuch matter would haue bene propounded vnto him becauſe it is well knowen to all that bee learned, that no man can iudge before hand <hi>de futuris contingenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus,</hi> of future contingents, and therefore he deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that he might be forborne.</p>
            <p n="86">86 But hereunto this reply being made, that although there can bee no certaine iudgement <hi>de futur is contingentibus, ſoil: contingant vel non contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant:</hi> whether they ſhall happen or not happen; yet of a certaine and determinate thing propoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, what might be thought of it, if it ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:22044:69"/>
there may before hand a direct and ſure iudgement be giuen: For example: it is <hi>futurum contingens,</hi> whether euer any King, and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in ENGLAND will make a Statute to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore to the Pope his <hi>Supremacie</hi> here, as fully as euer he had it: and yet it is not to bee doubted, but that he this Examinat, if he were now asked, whether in his iudgement, ſuch a Statute were lawfull and iuſt, or not, and might accordingly be put in execution: he would out of queſtion an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere before hand affirmatiuely: and euen ſo it being told this Examinate, that hee might doe in the caſe propounded; after ſome deliberation, thus he anſwered, viz:</p>
            <p n="87">87 That (as hee writ vnto the Cardinall) al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it ſhould be determined to be a point <hi>fidei formaliter,</hi> of faith <hi>formally,</hi> that the Pope might deale with Princes, as is aforeſaid, and were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſo to be receiued <hi>in theſi</hi> in the generall poſition: yet this queſtion propounded <hi>in hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſi,</hi> by way of particular ſuppoſition <hi>an Papa ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beat poteſtatem deponendi Regem</hi> noſtrum, <hi>rebus in co ſtatu, quo nunc ſunt, permanentibus apud nos,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Pope haue power to depoſe <hi>our</hi> King, matters continuing with vs in the ſtate, wherein now they are: he this Examinat ſaith now, as he writ then, that the determination of this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, touching his Maieſtie ſhould only be of that, which is <hi>fidei materialiter,</hi> of faith materially: <hi>quia eſſet determinatio de quaeſtione, quae in rebus creditis accidit, &amp; proinde non diceretur determinatio de fide,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:22044:69"/>
ſed de tali materiâ:</hi> becauſe it ſhould bee the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a queſtion which hapneth about things beleeued, and therefore is not to be ſaid to bee a determination touching <hi>Faith,</hi> but concerning ſuch or ſuch a matter: wherein, becauſe (as hee hath before obſerued out of <hi>Sylueſter,</hi> and <hi>Couar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruuias)</hi> the Pope may be deceiued; hee this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minat ſaith, that in his iudgment, let them define at <hi>Rome,</hi> what they liſt in this matter; yet if the ſame ſhould be offered to be practiſed againſt his Maieſtie, it ought not to bee entertained, recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, or obeyed by any of his Maieſties ſubiects, the ſame tending not to <hi>edification,</hi> but to <hi>deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="88">88 Againſt this anſwere ſuch exceptions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, as are before ſet downe: after ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther enforcing of them with many circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and repetitions of ſundry points, by him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore acknowledged: hee was at the laſt content further to enlarge himſelfe in maner hereafter en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing: affirming: viz:</p>
            <p>That in his iudgement, the Pope will neuer determine it to bee a matter of faith, for Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickes to beleeue, that hee hath authoritie to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Emperours, or Kings, to abſolue their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects from their Allegeance, and to authorize them, either to diſobey them, or to beare armes againſt them: becauſe hitherto, when it might haue beene better done, and with leſſe ſcandall, and inconuenience, it hath not beene ſo defined; notwithſtanding that the Popes themſelues in
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:22044:70"/>
their owne perſons, and the citie of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelfe haue bene in greater danger and perill, then they now are: and this Examinatis fully reſolued, that the preſent Pope, and the Cardinals his aſsiſtants are as graue, wiſe, and prouident now, to foreſee what euill, and inconuenience might grow to the Church by ſuch a reſolution, as euer any of their predeceſſors were in times paſt.</p>
            <p n="89">89 That he is fully perſwaded, that as it doth tend to the expreſsing of the ſupereminent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie of the iuſtice of God, to ſay, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not doe any thing, that is vniuſt; and of the great honour and dignitie of Kings and Princes, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme of them, that <hi>Reges non poſſunt eſſe ſerui:</hi> So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraignes cannot bee vaſſals: ſo it doth no way derogate from the high dignitie and calling of the Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> but rather doth greatly aduaunce it, to ſay, that becauſe hee cannot erre, there are therefore many things which hee cannot doe, For example, euen in the point queſtioned, as the Pope cannot determine it to be lawfull, vnder a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pretence whatſoeuer, for a man to commit ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ultery with his neighbours wife: no more can he determine it to bee lawfull vnder any pretence whatſoeuer, for any of his Maieſties ſubiects to beare armes againſt him; both of them being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the morall law of God, which the Goſpel doeth in no one point preiudice. Nor as he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not by any determination or reſolution, vpon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pretence whatſoeuer, make a ſonne to bee no ſonne, during the life of his father: no more can

Whereunto this Examinate now addeth,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:22044:82"/>
that in his iudgement, it is a vaine conceit and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the Scripture, for any to affirme, that the Pope hath any power, authoritie, or iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, either potentially or actually, ordinary or caſuall, to deale with kings or princes, or with their ſubiects, as is aboue mentioned, or to holde and maintaine, that kings and ſoueraigne princes haue their regall authoritie from the Pope, or that they are to him, as the rulers and <hi>Iudges</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were to <hi>Moſes,</hi> or that hee hath any authoritie at all, as he is Chriſts vicar, and S. <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſour, to deale with kings and princes for any cauſe, or at any time, further then concerneth the health of their ſoules, and the maintenance of the Catholicke faith, by admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions, perſwaſions, and good counſell: and (if thoſe will not ſerue) then by the ſpirituall cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Church, and by S. <hi>Peters</hi> keyes only; and not ſo neither, but when it is apparant, that ſuch ſpirituall cenſures may in deede and truely turne to <hi>edification,</hi> and not to <hi>deſtruction,</hi> and that they may be vſed without hurt or danger of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholickes either in their bodies, goods, or liues.

            <p n="112">112 But heere this Examinate being put in mind of his own words aboue ſpecified, wher he
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:22044:82"/>
acknowledged the Pope to haue <hi>caſualiter</hi> ſome authoritie in <hi>temporalibus,</hi> without the limits of S. <hi>Peters</hi> patrimonie, though the ſame were not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in him; and thereupon required to declare his meaning therein, he ſaith that he neither had nor hath any other meaning then this: that when any queſtions or controuerſies ariſe amongſt Kings, Princes, and ſuch other great perſons, as they cannot amongſt themſelues compound, but yet are contented to referre the deciſion or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding of them vnto the Pope, (vnto whome they are all ſubiect in Spirituall matters) hee (the ſaid Pope) may lawfully, in this Examinates iudgement, vpon this occaſion, and ſo <hi>caſualiter</hi> intermedle and deale in the ſaid queſtions and controuerſies, and order them, for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of vnitie, friendſhip, and concord betwixt the ſaid parties, although the particulars ſo queſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, or controuerted, be meerely and altogether of temporall conuſance. And alſo this Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate further ſaith, that the Pope may ſo deale (as he thinketh) when any King, Prince, or other great perſon will bee content, for the ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of his owne purpoſes in ſome eſpeciall mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to deſire the Popes approbation of it.

            <p n="123">123 By reaſon of diuers particulars deliuered by this Examinate in this his anſwere to the laſt doubt propounded vnto him, it was firſt deman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of him, whether in his iudgement the Pope hath authority to command any king, being held
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:22044:87"/>
for a Catholicke, to take armes againſt any his neighbour kings, deemed by him for heretickes, for the ſuppreſsing of them by temporall coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, when the Pope ſhall iudge it fit: becauſe it might ſeeme very ſtrange for any man to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that Chriſt euer gaue to S. <hi>Peter</hi> any iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, authoritie, or power, in fauour of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſet kings together by the eares. It might haue ſome probabilitie, that if a king, who diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth of the Popes ſupremacie, and of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corrupt points of popiſh doctrine, ſhould ſend his forces into any other temporall princes dominions, to make warres, of purpoſe to abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the Popes authoritie, and plant there the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed religion by him profeſſed; then in this caſe, the Pope might ſollicite ſome other kings adioyning, to oppoſe them ſelues &amp; make warres againſt him. But to imagine, that when a King proceedeth no further, then to order matters in his owne kingdome, by the aduiſe of the States thereof both Eccleſiaſticall and Temporall, as it ſhalbe iudged by him and them moſt expedient: any Biſhop or Spirituall perſon whoſoeuer may take vpon him to proclaime or excite warre, and thruſt other kings to aſſaile him by force in his owne kingdome and countrey: euery ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit wanteth authoritie in the new Teſtament, and hath no example for many yeeres in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt and beſt times of the Church, and beſides it is repugnant to that which this Examinate hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore deliuered. For kingdomes being neither
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:22044:88"/>
founded vpon faith nor grace, how can they be ſhaken, vnder pretence that either of them is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugned? Chriſtianitie may well be thought to binde a king, who reckoneth himſelfe ſubiect to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> in ſpirituall cauſes, in them to ſubmit him ſelfe vnto him: but to command him to make warre, and thereby hazard peraduenture his owne kingdome, or ſpend the blood either of his owne Subiects, or of the ſubiects of any other Chriſtian King, when the Pope thinketh good; is a very bloodie and an vnchriſtian opinion.</p>
            <p n="124">124 Vnto this queſtion and the parts thereof, this Examinate ſaith, that he beleeueth, that all Chriſtian Kings and Princes are bound to doe, what they can for the maintenance of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicke faith, (whether the Pope doeth require them ſo to doe, or not) againſt any that doe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deauour to ſuppreſſe it. But he holdeth that ſuch their duetie bindeth them no further, then ſo to maintaine religion within their owne kingdoms, if need be, and not to make warre in that reſpect againſt any, who doe containe themſelues and their proceedings aforeſaid, within their owne bounds, and doe not ſeeke by force to ſuppreſſe, in any other Countries, that are adiacent vnto them, the Religion there eſtabliſhed, otherwiſe then in his owne. But withall he addeth, that he holdeth it to be the duetie of all ſuch Catholike kings, to do what they can with any King auerſe from the Pope, for the winning of him vnto his Holineſſe by perſwaſion, and by euery other
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:22044:88"/>
good meanes: but in no wiſe by the ſword, or by ſolliciting his Subiects to rebellion, or to make a part of his owne Kingdome againſt him, or otherwiſe to endanger his Perſon, Crowne, or State. Beſides, for as much as (this Examinate ſaith) he beleeueth, that the Pope hath no inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent authoritie in himſelfe <hi>in temporalibus,</hi> out of S. <hi>Peters</hi> patrimonie, and that the regall authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is not deriued from the Pope, or held imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly of him; hee doeth not find, how the Pope, as he is either a Spirituall, or a ciuill Prince, hath authoritie to command the ſword of any Kings otherwiſe then by entreatie, and in the caſes by him this Examinate aboue ſpecified; or that they are bound by force of their Baptiſme, to obey him, if ſo he doe command them.</p>
            <p n="125">125 Secondly, were it granted to this Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, that the Pope, as a Ciuill Prince, might lawfully haue ſent his forces into <hi>Ireland</hi> as is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, and denounce warre when he thinketh it expedient, againſt any King, as <hi>Cardinall Allen</hi> hath written: yet it is fit, that this Examinate ſhould open himſelfe in his dutie to his Maieſtie, whether in his iudgement, when the Pope will needes take vpon him to play the temporall Prince, and become a warriour, hee holdeth it to bee at ſuch times more lawfull, and agreeable to the Scriptures, either for the Pope, or for any of his inſtruments, to perſwade the Subiects of any King, with whom hee contendeth, that becauſe hee is a Proteſtant (as that generall name is
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:22044:89"/>
growen in vſe) and denieth the Popes ſuprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and embraceth the Religion reformed, and purged of ſundry groſſe errours, and points of ſuperſtition, and is thereupon either by name, or in generall termes by vertue of ſome other <hi>Buls,</hi> Excommunicated, or becauſe he ſeeketh to alter the ancient Religion, which formerly they, or their forefathers did profeſſe, therefore it is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for them, nay, that they are bound in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to renounce their obedience vnto him, and to aſsiſt the Popes forces: then it is lawfull for the Emperour, or ſome other Kings (whoſe predeceſſours had made the Pope a Ciuil prince, by beſtowing vpon him ſo large poſſeſsions) when they haue reſolued of a warlike courſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him, to perſwade his Subiects, and autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rize them, to ioyne with them, and to beare armes againſt him, vpon theſe or any other ſuch like ſuggeſtions, viz: that the Pope abuſed his place, and behaued himſelfe otherwiſe, then of ancient times his predeceſſours had done: that it was neuer the meaning either of their former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowmed Emperours, or of any other Kings, or of the moſt famous Romanes, and Italians their Noble progenitors (who once gouerned the chiefeſt part of the world) that thereby he ſhould take courage, and boldneſſe to encounter (as hee did) with them their ſucceſſours, or to tyrannize, as his cuſtome was, ouer them his pretended Subiects, and ouer their ſometimes ſo glorious a Citie: and that therefore, if they would ioyne
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:22044:89"/>

heard of before (for ought this Examinate hath read) that the ſubiects of any King might not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt their Soueraigne in his warres without the Popes allowance.

ſo proportionably for euery one; neither Chriſt, nor any of his Apoſtles would haue moued them to any armes, or diſobedience againſt the ciuill Magiſtrates, although they were at that time ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great perſecutors, and impugners of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.

            <p>You are not ignorant of the oppoſitions, and parts-taking, concerning the <hi>Oath</hi> of <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legeance</hi> to his Maieſtie, whether with a ſafe conſcience it may be taken or not; nor how I haue bene blamed by diuers, and eſpecially by <hi>Cardinal Bellarmine,</hi> a worthy and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent man in the Church, for my iudgement, and former proceedings in that behalfe: nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther alſo, what the Popes holineſſe hath ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified vnto you in his two <hi>Briefes,</hi> touching that matter. Which may peraduenture make you to wonder, and grow iealous of my ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceritie in the Catholicke faith, when you ſhall finde me, notwithſtanding all that hitherto I haue either heard or ſeene, ſtill to continue in my former opinion, and to acquaint you with it, accounting it my duetie both before God and the world ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>I know what is conuenient, and profitable
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:22044:99"/>
for the Church, and what authoritie the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of Rome haue put in practiſe, with good ſucceſſe and approbation, againſt ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Emperours, Kings, and Princes, for many yeeres: and wiſh that the ſame had euer bin ſo mildly, and temperately vſed, as that it might neuer haue bene impugned, nor called in queſtion by any. But now that this point is ſo throughly ſearched into, not only by our aduerſaries, but by our ſelues likewiſe, &amp; I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſſed, as I haue bin, to deliuer my iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſincerely and truely, as in the ſight of God, &amp; accordingly to take the ſaid oath: &amp; ſince newly againe more earneſtly vrged then before: how could I chuſe but acknowledge what I thought, ſo farre as my learning rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, except I ſhould haue ſinned againſt mine owne conſcience, and incurred there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the wrath of God, who needeth by no vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trueths to haue his Church and the honour of it vpheld, and mainteined by any.</p>
            <p>It is one thing, what may be yeelded vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and put in practiſe <hi>de facto,</hi> and by poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue lawes; and another, what may truely be challenged <hi>iure diuino:</hi> which ſecond branch is that, which is now amongſt our owne bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren

ſo controuerted, and diuerſly defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as I feare greater preiudice will grow thereby to Catholicke religion, then is iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly, as yet foreſeene, or prouided for, to be preuented. For it can neuer bee iuſtified (ſay what men liſt) that the doctrine of the Church doeth by any true expoſition, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction any way diminiſh or empeach the Soueraigntie, and honour of Emperors, kings and princes, but doeth indeed confirme and eſtabliſh them: the contrary conceit where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was falſly imputed to the Chriſtians in the glorious ages of the Church, which did ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed the Apoſtles, and ought ſtill to be as much impugned and deteſted now, as it was then.</p>
            <p>That which <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine</hi> hath writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to this purpoſe, is ſound and Catholicke, and will neuer by any quirke be auoided. <hi>Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>did not, nor doeth take king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes</hi>

And therefore when a King becommeth a Chriſtian, hee doeth not loſe his earthly kingdome, which by right hee held, but purchaſeth a new intereſt to an euerla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting

               <hi>kingdomes: for dominion is not founded either in grace, or in faith: ſo as the Pope hath no authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie to meddle with them.</hi> As long then as kings be Ethnickes, they are ſure of their intereſt in their kingdomes, and of the obedience of their ſubiects; the very law of Nature doeth ratifie both: and can you conceiue, that as ſoone as they are become Chriſtians, their caſe is altered, in the aſſurance of their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall eſtates? Muſt it be pretended, that the benefite receiued by Chriſt, doeth no way preiudice the intereſt that Kings haue in their kingdomes: but when they haue ſubmitted themſelues to the doctrine of the Goſpel, in hope of the kingdome of heauen, and to haue their ſtates bettered, and their ſubiects ſetled, as touching their obedience, according to the precepts of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly vnto the morall Law of God: muſt then vpon any occaſion, <hi>grace</hi> deſtroy <hi>nature,</hi> or dominion be ſhaken, which is not founded in faith? Thinke you, that it was euer the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:22044:100"/>
either of <hi>Constantine</hi> the great, or of any other Kings or Princes, to receiue the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, or to ioyne their Regall authoritie with the Eccleſiaſticall, thereby to ſtrengthen Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops in the execution of their offices, with any purpoſe, that the power Eccleſiaſticall ſhould ſwallow vp, depreſſe, or ouertop their temporall Soueraigntie?</p>
            <p>Aſſuredly (my deare brethren) ſuch cogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations as theſe are ſcandalous to Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, and ought to make no impreſsion in your ſoules, otherwiſe then to eſchew them.

The coniunction of the Church with tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall kingdomes to make one Chriſtian bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die, doeth make no other tranſmutations, nor confound their gouernments and functions; they doe ſtill remaine diſtinct as they did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; ſo as neither can any Emperour, King,

<pb n="158" facs="tcp:22044:104"/>
you any lawfull entrances into ſuch diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and vndutifull courſes.</p>
            <p>That the Pope is the head of the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke Church, therein I am reſolute; as alſo that Emperours, Kings, and all other Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that profeſſe Chriſtianitie, are ſubiect in ſome caſes vnto his ſpirituall cenſures proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſo termed, as interdiction, and Excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication: but to eradicate them, or to depoſe them, by any authoritie he can challenge <hi>iure diuino in temporalibus,</hi> either <hi>directly</hi> or <hi>indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, in ordine ad ſpiritualia,</hi> that is vtterly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt my iudgement: and yet (I hope) I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſtill, as good a Catholicke, as any that holdeth the contrarie, notwithſtanding that Cardinall <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ſeemeth to affirme in his Letter to me, that no man can concurre with me in opinion herein, and ſo yeeld to take the Oath of Allegeance (which only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth the Popes authoritie in <hi>temporalibus,</hi> as well that which is aſcribed vnto him <hi>direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> as <hi>indirectly)</hi> but that hee muſt needes <hi>perfidiouſly denie the primacie of the See Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolicke.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At which his words, were they not groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded (I thinke) vpon ſome miſinformation,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:22044:104"/>
I ſhould greatly meruaile, conſidering that thereby hee doeth inſinuate, the Popes ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacie (which ought to bee maintained without any heſitation) to depend a great part of it vpon a wonderfull vncertaintie: For no man knoweth better then himſelfe, that it hath not beene hitherto determined by the Church, or iudicially by his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe, <hi>tanquam ex Cathedrâ,</hi> whether the Pope hath any authoritie at all <hi>in tempora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus,</hi> further then in thoſe things, that doe appertaine to S. <hi>Peters</hi> patrimonie, and other temporalties giuen to the See of <hi>Rome.</hi> And beſides, if it ſhall fall out hereafter, that the Pope ſhall be found to haue any ſuch au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie, it muſt haue beene giuen him by Chriſt either <hi>indirectly,</hi> as hee the ſaid <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall</hi> with many others his partakers doe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely affirme, or <hi>directly,</hi> as the oppoſite part againſt him doe take vpon them, with as great confidence, to mainteine, (each of them peremptorily denying the others aſser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:) and becauſe likewiſe vntill the point be ouerruled againſt one of the ſaid parts (which will not be done in haſte for many reſpects) it cannot poſsibly be determined, whether the
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:22044:105"/>
Pope hath any ſuch authoritie, as either of them holde, or not: it had beene fit in my iudgement for <hi>Cardinall Bellarmine,</hi> not to haue entangled the Popes ſupremacie, which is cleare and manifeſt, with theſe vncertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and perplexities, for to haue blamed me either for auoiding them my ſelfe, or admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of others to take heed, leſt they might be entrapped or ſnared with them.</p>
            <p>But his <hi>Amplitude</hi> writ vnto me, and cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red mee as it pleaſed him: which I could the more eaſily haue borne, as my duetie requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, had he not therby publiſhed to as many as ſhall ſee his Letter (the Copie whereof is, as I am informed, ſpread farre and neere) that by taking of the ſaid oath of Allegeance <hi>one of the chiefe heads of our faith, and foundations of Catholicke religion</hi> in diſcrimen adducitur, <hi>is brought into queſtion and endangered:</hi> there beeing indeede no ſuch head or founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hitherto agreed vpon or concluded. So as there is no cauſe (for ought I know, or can iudge) why I ſhould not ſtill perſeuere in the approbation of the lawfulneſſe of the ſaid othe, and continue my former admonitions
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:22044:105"/>
vnto you, for the ſubmitting of your ſelues vnto it, when it ſhalbe exacted of you, leſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe you wilfully caſt your ſelues into thoſe miſeries, which are likely to fall vpon you, not as ſo many arguments of happines, and that bleſſedneſſe which is promiſed to thoſe that ſuffer for the truths ſake, but of thoſe iudgements, which are inflicted vpon men, by Kings and ſuperiour gouernours, for their euill behauiour and diſobedience.</p>
            <p>Deceiue not therefore your ſelues (bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren) ſuch ſufferings are not the way to Martyrdome, nor approued of God: neuer might treacherie or rebellion, or the bearing of armes by ſubiects againſt their Soue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignes, or their ſecret deſignements againſt them, or the execution of the ſame to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering or hurt of their royall perſons, be graced, or honored with that moſt glorious title, by whomſoeuer they were either autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized, vndertaken or practiſed. Take heede (I do moſt humbly beſeech you) of this kind of leauen: be your lumpe of dough otherwiſe neuer ſo pure, ſweet, and ſincere, this mixture will make it ſowre, and corrupt it. Stand faſt in the Catholicke faith, and in the true pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſsion
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:22044:106"/>
thereof, as hitherto you haue done.</p>
            <p>Bee not led away with various and ſtrange doctrines of depoſing of Kings, of abſoluing their ſubiects from their Allegeance, of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing them to rebell, to beare armes againſt them, to plot and lay ſnares ſecretly how to entrap them, or to offer hurt or violence to their perſons. Theſe things (I thanke God) my heart doeth abhorre, and my ſpirit with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in me doeth loath and deteſt them: The voice that bade <hi>Peter, Kill and eate,</hi> neuer meant that hee ſhould deale ſo with Princes, caſt them out of their ſeates, and beſtow their kingdomes vpon others, or procure them to be killed, that Chriſtians and Catholicke re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion might flouriſh and bee comforted. Meats and drinks may eſtabliſh our ſtrength; but ſuch proceedings with kings ought to be no foode for our ſoules. <hi>Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would haue had the <hi>Samaritanes</hi> to haue beene deſtroyed with fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, for that they would not receiue their maſter Chriſt, were ſharpely rebuked and told by him, that they knew not of what ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit they were. S. <hi>Peter</hi> drewe his ſword, and ſmote off <hi>Malchus</hi> eare, in as iuſt a cauſe to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:22044:106"/>
the eyes of humane wiſedome, as was poſsi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but Chriſt diſliked that his fact, and gaue it for a generall rule or caueat (in my iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) to all Catholicke prieſts and people, ſaying: that all that ſtrike with the ſword, ſhall periſh with the ſword. Theſe and ſuch like things (my deare brethren) are written out of queſtion to our correption and Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licke information.</p>
            <p>Beware therefore of them in whoſe mouthes and actions <hi>ſanguis nihil eſt,</hi> bloud is nothing: <note place="margin">Ecclus. 8. 19.</note> tread not in the ſteps of ruine, ſtumble not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt rockes, commit not your ſelues to ſuch laborious wayes. If your owne children (who are fathers) or your owne fathers (who are children) ſhould perſwade you to any of theſe courſes, doe not follow their counſell, for it is not of God: let <hi>Buchananus</hi> and his fellowes, and whoſoeuer elſe doe follow them, runne alone in theſe rebellious and wicked races. But inquire you, according to the Prophets direction, and your owne Catholicke profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, of the olde pathes, <hi>quae ſit via bone,</hi> which is the good way, and walke in it. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teinly, be you well aſſured, theſe wayes wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I will put you in minde, were the olde

him to be appointed of God: That they ſo wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped the Emperour, as they lawfully might and was expedient for him, as a man the ſecond from God, and leſſe then God onely: That they did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uocate the eternall God for the health of their</hi>
