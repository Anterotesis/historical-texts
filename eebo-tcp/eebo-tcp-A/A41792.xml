            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THAT Prophecy of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 4. That <hi>Men ſhall turn away their Ears from the Truth, and ſhall be turned unto Fables,</hi> had too much of its Verification in the early Times of Chriſtianity; and as in other reſpects, ſo in the caſe of ſacred Baptiſm, both in reſpect of the Time and Order in which it ſhould be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. 1. From a Fear that Sin committed after Baptiſm ſhould hardly (if at all) be remitted, many did delay their Duty, being deſirous to have the full remiſſion of their Sins near their Death. This ſcandalous delay of Baptiſm proved pernicious to the Church of Chriſt, as well as to the Perſons thus neglecting their Duty, and ſeems to have been the occaſion of altering the manner of the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm. For many of theſe Delayere being ſurpriſed with Sickneſs, and afraid to die without Baptiſm, requeſted that it might be adminiſtred to them in their ſick Beds, which was endulged to them without any Warrant from Heaven, which in ſuch caſes ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be enquired for. Yet this Cuſtom was ſo doubtful to them that did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it, that they required ſuch <hi>Chinicks,</hi> that in caſe they recovered their Sickneſs, they ſhould be had to the River, and there be baptized. <hi>Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Epiſt. ad Magnum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>2. Others did as much outrum the Rule of this Duty in prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous<note place="margin">S. Fiſher<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bap. <gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>. p. 311.</note> haſte, even to baptize Infants as ſoon as born, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times before; and this Error ſprang from this apprehenſion, that God had tied the Solvation of all Fleſh to Baptiſm, that even Infants dying without it, could not be ſaved: Yea ſo powerful was this Error, that its Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertors did Anathematize all that held the contrary. The <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Afric</hi> decreed, <hi>That all that affirm young Children receive eternal Life, albeit they be not by Baptiſm renewed, they are accurſed.</hi> Sure a more unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Decree was never made by Men.</p>
            <p>Now this Leaven of falſe Doctrine has ſo prevailed, that ſcarce any but Infants came to be concerned in obeying Chriſt in Baptiſm; nor could poor Infants obey him therein; for <hi>Auſtin</hi> confeſſes they did not willingly receive Baptiſm, but ſtrove againſt it with great Crying. So that neither Young nor Old (in a manner) were found in ſome Ages to put on Chriſt in Baptiſm, ſeeing that cannot be done without the free Conſent of an Heart enlightened by Faith; <hi>Gal. 3. 26, 27. Acts 2. 40.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is therefore the work and proper buſineſs of the Reſtorers of holy Baptiſm to do what they poſſibly may to remove this Stumbling-block out of the way, I
<pb facs="tcp:110699:3"/>
mean this Doctrine which would damn to Helliſh Torments all Infants dying unbaptized. Concerning which I have wrote ſeveral Treatiſes, and could be content ſtill to be an Advocate for all dying Infants, as being through the Grace of God in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, diſcharged of the condemning Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Original Sin, and having no Actual Sin, the Infirmity of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſhall not damn them, but the Mercy of God ſhall ſave them all. And were Mens Judgments clear in this Point, the Controverſy about Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm would naturally ceaſe, and all Men would ſee it the only ſafe way to refer Baptiſm to the time wherein through Repentance and Faith it might, according to the Will of God, intereſs them in the remiſſion of their Sins, and in the Priviledges of the Church of the Living God, in order to Life eternal.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore once more endeavour to take away this falſe Covering, which is not of God's Spirit, I mean the Doctrine of Infant-Damnation, by propoſing a few things to this Generation, as an Introduction to my Reply to <hi>the Caſe of Infant-Baptiſm.</hi> And,</p>
            <p>1. Seeing it cannot enter into the Heart of any Chriſtian (I hope) that God does create Infants on purpoſe to damn them, and to ſhew them no Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy (ſeeing he is very merciful to the chief of Sinners) if we can find out a juſt cauſe for the damning of them, it muſt be either, 1. From themſelves, from their Parents, from the Devil, or from Chriſt's not loving them, ſo as to redeem them from the Fall which they had in <hi>Adam.</hi> But none of theſe things can be the cauſe of Infants Damnation. 1. <hi>They cannot damn themſelves by ſinful Courſes, and it is certain our gracious God will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> damn none, who do not firſt deſtroy themſelves by their Wickedneſs.</hi> This is evident by his unwillingneſs to deſtroy thoſe who had deſtroyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <hi>Hoſea 13. 9. O Iſrael, thou haſt deſtroyed thy ſelf, but in me is thy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Help.</hi> How then can it enter into any Chriſtian to think that God ſhould have no pity for innocent Babes who never offended him? Is he thus compaſſionate towards great Sinners, and is there no Help in him for poor Infants?</p>
            <p>2. <hi>No Man can damn Infants,</hi> becauſe if any have power to damn his Infants, all Men have it, it's no Man's peculiar Power (whether good or bad) to do this; and if any ſay, all Men have this Power, he reflects upon the Goodneſs of God for giving ſuch power to Men, and contradicts the Word of God, <hi>Jer. 31. Every one ſhall die for his own Iniquity—the Son ſhall not bear the Iniquity of the Father.</hi> This is only true in the caſe of eternal Death: for Children, even Infants, often die for their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Sin a temporal Death, as in the <hi>old World,</hi> in <hi>Sodom,</hi> yea and in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> too, <hi>Lam. 2. 11.</hi> Yet who can think that our just and merciful God ſhould now after their ſwooning in the Streets, caſt them into Helliſh Torments. It was not the Iniquity of the Infants, but of the grown Perſons which cried for Vengeance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:110699:3"/>3. The Devil cannot damn Infants, becauſe they are out of the Reach of his Temptations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They know not to chuſe them, nor refuſe them; they know not their right hand from the left<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they know neither Good nor Evil; whom the Devil cannot tempt, them he cannot damn. A learned Proteſtant tells us, <hi>God will not damn any Perſon for that which they <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> help.</hi> This Sentence muſt needs be as true in the caſe of Infants as any <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> World. And indeed the Equity of that merciful Law, <hi>Deut. 22. 25, 26.</hi> may ſuffice to convince any Man, that in the Judgment of the Almighty there is no Sin in Infants worthy of Damnation; ſeeing what Sin ſoever is upon them, it was impoſſible for them to avoid it. They therefore ſhall not be damned for it.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt puts the Queſtion, <hi>How can ye eſcape the Damnation of Hell?</hi> He ſpeaks to incorrigible Sinners, that the Fear of Damnation ſhould not overwhelm weak Perſons; but never did he ſpeak a Word againſt poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants. He never told them they were of the Devil. Satan is not the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Infants. Ergo, they are not his Children.</p>
            <p>4. Chriſt loved and gave himſelf for all dying Infants; therefore not one of them ſhall be damned. Chriſt <hi>gave himſelf a Ranſom for all:</hi> He loved, <hi>and dyed for the chief of Sinners.</hi> Therefore he loved and died for the poor innocent Babes: <hi>He bought them that deny him,</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2. How ſhould he deſpiſe the helpleſs Infant?</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>If God be ſo good to all Infants, why then is he not ſo good to let them be baptized. I anſwer;</hi> God is good to Infants in that he accepts them without Baptiſm. And I appeal to any conſidering Man, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he was not as good to the Infants of the Righteous before <hi>Abraham,</hi> as he was to the Infants of <hi>Abraham?</hi> and whether God was not as good to an Infant in <hi>Iſrael</hi> of 7 days old, as to an Infant of 8 days old? And whether God be not as good to us, in that he accepts us in the uſe of a very few Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, as he was to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> accepting them in the uſe of many Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies? And whether if he had pleaſed to accept of us upon Repentance and Faith without Baptiſm, he had not been as good to us, as now, that together with Repentance and Faith he does require Baptiſm? The Truth is, Baptiſm is therefore good, becauſe it is commanded. It is not good in it ſelf, no more was Circumciſion, nor indeed any Ceremony. Now Repentance and Faith are good in themſelves, it's abſolutely neceſſary, that thoſe that ſin, be humbled for it and forſake it. It's abſolutely neceſſary for the Creature to believe, and to depend upon the Creator.</p>
            <p>Now Baptiſm though it be not good in it ſelf, yet Heavens Authority en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyning it, and Divine Myſteries being contained in it, and Priviledges con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred by it, it is therefore good to thoſe to whom it is appointed. But where God requires is not, but extends his Goodneſs without it, it is a like Vanity
<pb facs="tcp:110699:4"/>
in us to give it where he does not appoint it, as it would have been in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to give Circum<gap reason="illegible" extent="6 letters">

                  <desc>〈◊◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to whom it did belong by Appointment.</p>
            <p>And therefore I conſider further, that as thoſe had no Loſs of any Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg that was neceſſary for them in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who by the Law were not requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be circumciſed [as in the caſe of all Females] So neither ſhall any loſe God's Favour for not being baptized when he requires it not. The Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger lieth on the other ſide. For had <hi>Abraham</hi> out of a conceit of making Infants [Male] of 7 days old, and all his Females alſo Sharers in the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, equally with thoſe of 8 days old circumciſed them, he had hazarded both his own and their Loſs of the Covenant. In like manner, whoever will (preſumptuouſly at leaſt) baptize any Perſon whom God does not require to be baptized, is ſo far from bringing him into Covenant, that he runs the hazzard of loſing his own part in the Covenant: <hi>Rev. 22. For I teſtify unto every Man. - If any ſhall add unto theſe things, God ſhall add to him the Plagues which are written in this Book.</hi> But,</p>
            <p>4. <hi>All dying Infants are under the Bleſſing of the Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of Grace, therefore no dying Infant ſhall be damned.</hi> This, how ſtrange ſoever it may ſeem, muſt be a Truth, or elſe poor dying Infants are the worſt of Creatures. When therefore we ſay all dying Infants are in the Covenant of Grace, we mean it, as God hath vouchſafed to intereſs them in his Mercy by Chriſt; That as Condemnation came upon them by <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, ſo Juſtification of Life has abounded towards them by the Obedience of Chriſt; and he himſelf that beſt knew God's Deſign concerning them, has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, without excepting ſo much as one of them, that <hi>to them belongs the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> And what then is he that ſhould except them, as the manner of ſome is, and in their cruel Judgment ſend them by Millions to Hell Torments? Now either Infants (even all of them) are thus in or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bleſſing of the Covenant through the Mercy of God, or they are not concern'd in any Covenant at all: for the Covenant of pure Nature, as made with <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, concerns not Infants, but as the Breach of it is imputed to Mankind; but here they are loſt. The Covenant of Works con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns them not, it cannot be ſaid of them, <hi>the Man that doth theſe things ſhall live in them.</hi> And to ſay that Infants are under the Bleſſing of no Covenant, is to rank them with the vileſt of Men, yea which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils themſelves, who are therefore moſt accurſed, becauſe there is no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, no Mercy for them. <hi>They are ſhut up in Chains under Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Judgment of the great day.</hi> Now far be it from all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to have ſuch Thoughts of God, <hi>whoſe tender Mercies are over all his Works.</hi> The very Devils had a State wherein they might have been 
<pb facs="tcp:110699:4"/>
happy, but preſumptuouſly <hi>fell from it,</hi> Jude v. 6. But poor Babes before they had a being were expoſed to Condemnation through the Offence of another. Shall theſe Objects of Pitty periſh eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally too without Remedy? O God forbid; let them be preſſed with <hi>all the Inconveniences conſequent to Original Sin, yet either it will not be laid to the charge of Infants, ſo as to be ſufficient to condemn them; or if it could, yet the Mercy and abſolute Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God will ſecure them, if he takes them away before they can glorify him with a free Obedience.</hi> Dr. <hi>Taylor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>5. <hi>No Man is able to prove that any Infant ever was or ever ſhall be damned to hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Torments; therefore none of them, dying ſuch, ſhall be damned.</hi> We ſhould hold nothing as a Point of Faith, but upon clear Proof, and eſpecially things of ſo high a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as this is. Some Men talk of ſome Infants as if they were little better than Devils. But could never yet bring a juſt charge againſt any one of that innocent part of Mankind. The Inſtance of <hi>Eſau</hi> is all that looks like an Enemy to Infants, but mind it well, there is no ſuch matter in it. God knew that <hi>Eſau</hi> ſhould not dy an Infant, he knew he would be a bad Man, and is judged as ſuch. <hi>Eſau</hi> is not to be ranked with dying Infants; and this Inſtance failing, there is not the Shadow of any Proof that God will damn poor dying Infants.</p>
            <p>But becauſe the Doctor, whoſe Book we are to examine, has ſome Kindneſs for all dying Infants, as I conceive, though the Quality of his Subject does ſometimes enforce him to drop ſuch Sentences as may ſeem to deny all Mercy to unbaptized Infants, yet he corrects all ſuch Paſſages, by ſaying they may be ſaved by uncovenanted Mercy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> A ſtrange Speech it is, but there is ſome Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to poor Infants dying without Baptiſm; I ſhall therefore inſiſt no farther at preſent upon the p<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>int of Infants Salvation; but make my way to the Book itſelf, by premiſing a few things.</p>
            <p>Our late Aſſertors of Infant-Baptiſm ſeem to me to be ready to yield that Chriſt has not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to baptize Infants, yea ſome of them grant it in <hi>totidem verbis;</hi> yet they think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſafe, becauſe (in their Judgment) <hi>Infant Baptiſm is not forbidden.</hi> And with this Apprehenſion away they go to the Jews for Relief, who out of their <hi>Talmud, Gemara,</hi> and <hi>Maimonides</hi> give them an account of ſome ſuch <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage among the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> And now from Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> (who has ſearched much into the Rabinical Doctrine) they grow confident that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was a Jewiſh Ceremony originally, though they grant it was but of humane Inſtitution, and that the Chriſtian Baptiſm is but the Copy, which is taken from that Original. Yea the learned Author of the caſe of Infant Baptiſm does tell us boldly; <hi>That our Saviour being obliged to lay by Circumciſion, conſecrated this Cuſtom of the Jewiſh Church to be the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Initiation into his Church.</hi> But certainly <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm of Repentance for Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Sins, which was from Heaven and not of Men, was more fit to be eſtabliſhed by our Lord Chriſt, for a perpetual Miniſtery in his Church, than ſuch a Jewiſh Cuſtom.</p>
            <p>Pitty it is that we ſhould yet be contending about Infant-Baptiſm from this ſuppoſed humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Jews. When our needful Work is to do our Endeavour, to prepare our Youth (and many aged Perſons too) for an orderly Admiſſion to that Holy Laver for Remiſſion of Sins, and not to blind their Eyes by fabling to them that they were regenerate and born again<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſoon almoſt as they came into the World. We have certainly as much need of good Schools to catechiſe our Youth, and to prepare them thereby for the Profeſſion of the moſt ſacred Religion, as the ancient Chriſtians had.</p>
            <p>This is the way to have our Poſterity to receive the Truth in the Love of it, when their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are informed to underſtand it in the Beauty and Excellency as well as to ſee the Neceſſity of it. This is the way to have them ſtand faſt under all Revolutions, when they have been radicated <hi>in the firſt Principles of Cathechiſm,</hi> Heb. 6. 1, 2. Theſe Principles of Chriſtianity are plain and eaſy to be underſtood, and yet God knows there are but a few that have a competent <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding of them in this Nation. And it is but a bad way to promote Chriſtian Knowledg in Principles of Catechiſm [as that of Baptiſm is ſuch] by Stories out of the <hi>Talmud,</hi> or other Jewiſh Books, which if we had them we cannot underſtand them, why then are we ſent unto
<pb facs="tcp:110699:5"/>
them? Is the Holy Scripture leſs able to make us wiſe to Salvation than the <hi>Talmud?</hi> Let us take to the good old way, and diligently teach our<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Youth the Rudiments of Religion; ſo ſhall Goodneſs and Mercy follow us all the days of our Life, and we ſhall dwell (by our Poſterity) in the Houſe of the Lord for ever.</p>
            <p>One main thing in the Book now under Conſideration is <hi>the Covenant of Circumciſion,</hi> which the Doctor will have to be a Goſpel-Covenant, and Circumciſion a Goſpel-Ordinance. Now aſ all this were true, it would come ſhort of proving it our Duty to baptize our Infants. For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is a proper time for our Participation of all Goſpel-Priviledges, ſo we muſt learn what time this is, not from Circumciſion, (for then the <hi>8th</hi> day muſt preciſely be the time) but from Chriſt and his Apoſtles, who are our only infallible Inſtructors herein. But that the Doctor is miſtaken in this thing which he makes a Pillar to his Building, is (I hope) ſufficiently made manifeſt.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhall it be amiſs in this place to give you the Judgment of a very learned Jew, lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted and baptized in the City of <hi>London,</hi> bicauſe he may rationally be thought to underſtand the Nature of the Covenant of Circumciſion (being a great Student in all Jewiſh, as well as Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Theology) as any other Man. And this is the account we have from him of this matter, in his printed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Expoſition upon the Acts of the Apoſtles, <hi>chap. 2. 40. The Jews</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>who were circumciſed in Infancy, before Circumciſion was abrogated, were here bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, by the order of</hi> Peter: <hi>from whence it appears that by Baptiſm and Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> two Covenants altogether differing, <hi>were to be ſealed, of which the one was with thoſe who by the Law of Nature were born of the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>the other with thoſe who were ſpiritually reborn by the Gift of Faith.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And whereas one main hinge upon which the Doctors Diſcourſe for Infant-Baptiſm is ſupported, is the Cuſtom of the Jewiſh Church, and the Cuſtom of the ancient Chriſtian Church, the ſaid learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Jew ſpeaks very well to that Plea in theſe Words: <hi>The Cuſtoms of Churches ought to ſubmit to the Words of Chriſt, not the Words of Chriſt to be wreſted to the Cuſtoms of the Church; in regard the Words of Chriſt are the Foundation upon which all Church-Cuſtoms are to be built, that they may be ſafe and laudable. Whatſoever ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours againſt the Words of Chriſt, ſavours againſt the Truth; and, as</hi> Tertullian <hi>ſays, what ever ſavours contrary to Truth, is Hereſy, though it be an ancient Cuſtom. It is in the Power of God to pardon thoſe that err out of Simplicity; but becauſe we erred once<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we are not always to go on in our Errors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor divides his Book into a previous Diſcourſe, and into the Reſolution of five Queſtions. In ſtating and reſolving his Queſtions, he repeats much of the previous Diſcourſe: I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to take his ſence, and have ſet down many of his Words; and my Reply to his previous Diſcourſe may ſerve as a Supplement to my Reply to the Reſolution of his Queſtions, becauſe the ſame Arguments are handled in both.</p>
            <p>What I have added about the Sign of the Croſs in Baptiſm, I have collected chiefly from a learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Proteſtant Writer, in a Book intituled, <hi>A Scholaſtical Diſcourſe againſt Symbolizing with Antichriſt in Ceremonies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have intituted my Book (as you ſee) <hi>The laſt and moſt Friendly Debate concerning In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm.</hi> And glad ſhould I be to ſee an end of the Controverſy, by an Agreement in the Truth, or a brotherly Condeſcenſion in ſuch things on either part, as may be without Sin.</p>
            <p>That I have undertaken this Task was, not the Fruit of my own Choice, but indeed I was particularly deſired by Letter from ſome Perſons of Quality and Learning to give a brief and diſtinct Anſwer to the Contents of the <hi>Caſe of Infant-Baptiſm;</hi> which they commend for the temper <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> which it is framed, and for that it is very nervous in Argument; inſomuch that till it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, it was ſo ſatisfactory, that more need not be ſaid on their part. And now, I hope, they will do me the Juſtice, as to read me with Patience, and to judg without Prejudice, knowing that ſhortly we muſt all appear before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt, and receive from him the things done in the Body, whether they be good or bad.</p>

            <head>
               <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> That the Covenant, <hi>Gen. 17.</hi> (ſtrictly taken) was not a Goſpel-Covenant, nor Circumciſion a Goſpel-Ordinance, as is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Doctor.</head>
            <p>THE Learned Author of the Book now under Conſideration, may rationally expect ſome Reply from thoſe whom he calls <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> or elſe interpret their Silence to be either a ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſlighting of his Endeavours to convince them, or that they are not able (in their own Judgments) to ſhew the Inſufficiency<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of his Arguments; and the rather, becauſe he has more obliged us to conſider his Writing, by his modeſt and friendly management of the Controverſy, than many of his Brethren who have bent their Stile againſt us.</p>
            <p>We ſhall therefore (God willing) with no leſs Modeſty and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Demeanour, ſhew our Reaſons, why in our Judgment his Labours have not only come ſhort of proving the baptizing of Infants to be warrantable by God's Word, but has rather given us great cauſe to think, that the Caſe of Infant-Baptiſm cannot be made good by all that Learning and Art can do, it being wholly without Divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. And to make this good, we will now conſider the chief of his Strength, in the ſeveral Pages of his Learned Treatiſe.</p>
            <p>In <hi>pag.</hi> 1, &amp; 2. he would have it believed, that the State of the Church from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and from <hi>Moſes</hi> to Chriſt was paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd by the differing State of the Chriſtian Church from Chriſt to
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:110699:6"/>
               <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and from <hi>Conſtantine</hi> onwards. <hi>For</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there is ground for this diſtinction in the reaſon of the thing, as is evident to any Man who is capable of conſidering the difference betwixt the Church Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, before and after its <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with the Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here ſeems to be a very great miſtake in the very entrance of his Book, for it is certain that the Jewiſh Church from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> had very little of the Face of a Church-ſtate till his time, being as yet deſtitute of moſt of her Laws, both for Conſtitution and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf owning a Prieſt ſuperior to himſelf, even after he was called of God, and had received the Promiſe both of being that Perſon in whoſe Seed all Nations ſhould be bleſſed, and that to his Seed God would give the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> as will appear to ſuch as ſhall peruſe theſe Scriptures; <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 1, 2, 3. &amp; 13. 15, 16. &amp; 14. 18, 19, 20.</p>
            <p>Now this Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> that in his Seed all Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. which was indeed an Evangelical Promiſe or Covenant, (and in the Faith of which <hi>Abraham</hi> was juſtified, near thirty Years before Circumciſion had any being in the World) cannot be called the <hi>Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.</hi> Neither yet when Circumciſion was inſtituted, was the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> formed into a Church-ſtate, in contradiſtinction to all the World beſide, for ſtill <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> was <hi>Priest of the moſt High God,</hi> and many righteous Men were then living, who outlived <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> himſelf, and were truly Church-members, yea and Governors of Churches too, as well as <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet they were not at all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in the Covenant of Circumciſion: And hence it's evident, they <hi>being under the Covenant of Grace<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> the Covenant of Circumciſion, and the Covenant of Grace <hi>were then diſtinct,</hi> and <hi>not the ſame Covenant,</hi> ſo, but that the one might and did ſubſiſt without the other.</p>
            <p>This then may ſerve to ſhew the Doctor's great Miſtake, in making the Church of Chriſt, from Chriſt to <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> parrallel to the Church from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> when in Truth a greater Diſparity can hardly be ſhewed: For though the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> till <hi>Moſes</hi> was in a State of Peregrination, as alſo was the Church of Chriſt till <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> yet the Church Chriſtian was then not only in her Purity, but alſo both for Conſtitution and Government, as compleat as ever ſhe was ſince, having received from Chriſt and his Apoſtles all the Rules of his holy Word (<hi>even the whole Counſel of God</hi>) neceſſary to her Church-ſtate; and therewith all the Gifts of the holy Spirit, in moſt plentiful manner, by which to <hi>ſtand perfect in all the Will of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:110699:6"/>And on the other ſide, the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> till the Times of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> had neither Law, Prieſt-hood, nor Sacrifice, <hi>in a ſettled Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,</hi> only they were diſtinguiſhed by the Covenant of Circumciſion, as a People from whom in time the Saviour of the World ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and that they ſhould be ſeparated from the Nations, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in a plentiful Country, with Laws and ſpecial Protection from the Almighty <hi>till Shiloh ſhould come;</hi> and when the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the Covenant of Circumciſion ceaſed, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Goſpel-Covenant was now plenarily to be <hi>made known to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the Obedience of Faith,</hi> Rom. 16. And here we will take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of that excellent Paſſage in Mr. <hi>Baxter, The Jews</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>were not the whole of God's Kingdom, or Church of Redeemed Ones in the World, but that as the Covenant was made with all Mankind, ſo amongſt them God had other Servants beſides the Jews, though it was they that had the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Benediction of being his peculiar Sacred People.</hi> Now as this was true all along, ſo it was more particularly manifeſt in the times of <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> and other holy Men that outlived <hi>Abraham.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What the Doctor means to compare <hi>Conſtantine</hi> with <hi>Moſes,</hi> is very doubtful: Is it to make Chriſtian Magiſtrates Legiſlators to the Church of Chriſt? We know indeed <hi>Moſes</hi> was a great Prophet, and appointed of God to give Laws and Statutes to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> but <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was not his Antitype, but Chriſt only: and whoſoever will not hear him ſhall be cut off, but not by the Imperial Sword, as God knows ſince the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of the Church Chriſtian to the Empire, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Civil</hi> and Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Power for the management of Church-matters, there has been a very bloody Scene of Affairs in moſt Places where ſuch a kind of Unity of the Church with the Empire or Worldly Government has been found, and for the moſt part thoſe who held to the Truth in the greateſt Purity and Power of it, became a Prey to that Church who obtained that Grandeur and Advantage, of which <hi>England</hi> has of late, as well as formerly, been a terrible Inſtance.</p>
            <p>Another remarkable difference betwixt the Church Chriſtian from Chriſt to <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> and that of the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> from his Days to <hi>Moſes,</hi> was this, The latter ſo far as it may be called a Church in that time was National, and dependant on the Family of <hi>Abraham,</hi> none being permitted to dwell in the ſame Family unleſs circumciſed. But the Church Chriſtian from Chriſt to <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was not National, nor dependant on any Family, as ſuch, but conſiſted only of ſuch in any Family as feared Ged, and wrought Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 34, 35. And this being conſidered, will ſhew that the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:110699:7"/>
Church from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Moſes</hi> was not ſo Spiritual and Evangelical, as the Doctor would have it, but were rather natural Branches of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, and the greateſt part of them groſly ignorant of the Evangelical Covenant made with <hi>Abraham</hi> before he was circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, which plainly appeared, not only in that they underſtood lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Moſes,</hi> as he foreſhewed the Coming of Chriſt, but alſo when Chriſt the true Seed, to whom the Promiſe was made, came to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh it, <hi>they knew him not, nor the Voice of their own Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor brings <hi>Gal. 3. 17. &amp; Rom.</hi> 4. 13. to prove <hi>that the Jewiſh Church was founded upon an Evangelical Covenant, for ſubſtance the ſame with that which ſince is made betwixt God and us through Chriſt.</hi> And he gives a Paraphraſe upon <hi>Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 4. from <hi>ver.</hi> 9 to 15. &amp; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. from <hi>v.</hi> 5 to 10. <hi>to prove that Faith was the Condition of the Abrahamical Covenant,</hi> which being underſtood of the Covenant or Promiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. of the <hi>bleſſing all Nations in the Seed of Abraham,</hi> and the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or Condition of believing that Promiſe, to extend only to ſuch as had Means and Ability to believe it, is not denied by us; nor can it ſignify any thing to the Doctor's purpoſe, for ſure he cannot bring Infants under this Condition, which is the thing he drives at.</p>
            <p>But for a more full Anſwer, Let us conſider where the ſtreſs of the matter lies between the Doctor and us: He would have this Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Covenant to be the <hi>Covenant of Circumciſion,</hi> Gen. 17. We ſay, <hi>'Tis the Covenant or Promiſe,</hi> Gen. 12. Now in the Doctor's Text <hi>Abraham</hi> is promiſed, that <hi>Nations ſhall come out of him, and that he ſhall be a Father of many Nations;</hi> but not a word of the Bleſſing which concerns <hi>all the Nations of the Earth.</hi> Now in our Text we have it full, <hi>In thee ſhall all Families of the Earth be bleſſed.</hi> But the beſt way is to let St. <hi>Paul</hi> reſolve this Doubt, even as he is quoted by the Doctor, <hi>Rom. 4. The Promiſe that he ſhould be Heir of the World was not given to</hi> Abraham, <hi>or to his Seed through the Law.</hi> And what Law was <hi>Abraham</hi> under, but the Law or Covenant of Circumciſion? The Apoſtle adds, <hi>But through the Righteouſneſs of Faith;</hi> and yet more plainly, <hi>Rom. 4. 10. How was it then reckoned? when he was in Circumciſion or in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Not in Circumciſion, but in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> moſt clearly refers to the Promiſe made <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. near thirty years before <hi>Abraham</hi> was circumcis'd. Now whether Circumciſion be of the Law, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was a Goſpel-Ordinance, is the buſineſs to be conſidered.</p>
            <p>The Doctor does expreſly affirm, <hi>that Circumciſion was a Goſpel-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance,</hi> p. 24. And we ſay directly contrary, <hi>that it was a Legal or Jewiſh Ceremony.</hi> To prove that Circumciſion was no Goſpel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:110699:7"/>
we argue thus, <hi>That which could profit no Man, except he kept the whole Law, was no Goſpel Ordinance,</hi> &amp;c. The Apoſtle proves the <hi>mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, Rom 2. 25. Circumciſion verily proſiteth if thou keep the Law; but if thou be a Breaker of the Law, thy Circumciſion is made <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion.</hi> And we argue further from <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2. If Circumciſion bound Men to keep the whole Law, then it was no Goſpel-Ordinance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Aſſumption is proved by the Text; <hi>I teſtify again to every Man that is circumciſed, that he is a Debtor to do the whole Law.</hi> Circumciſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore could never be a Goſpel-Ordinance: for as the Goſpel frees us from the condemning Power, and from the Servitude of the Law, ſo every Goſpel-Ordinance holds forth that bleſſed Freedom to all faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Men in both Reſpects. And hence it is clear that howſoever Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion was a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith to <hi>Abraham,</hi> it could not be ſo as a Goſpel-Ordinance (for he was a Breaker of the Law after this) any more than his Offering his Son <hi>Iſaac</hi> upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, <hi>Jam. 2. 21, 22. In which he was juſtified by Faith.</hi> And ſo was <hi>Abel</hi> in his Sacrifice, <hi>Gen. 4. Heb.</hi> 11. Yea theſe were evident Seals and Pledges of their Faith, as much as Circumciſion was to <hi>Abraham,</hi> yet none of thoſe can hence be proved to be Goſpel-Ordinances. For indeed at the rate of the Doctor's arguing, all the Sacrifices propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, performed by faithful Men in the time of the Law, may be proved to be Goſpel-Ordinances as well as Circumciſion. And by his Conſequence all that took part in theſe Sacrifices, have a right to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate in all Goſpel-Ordinances which hold forth Chriſt and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, as well as in Baptiſm. And becauſe the Doctor builds much upon this <hi>Topic<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> we will further try the Strength of it; <hi>That which was always in Compariſon of the Goſpel, a weak and beggarly Element, was never a Goſpel-Ordinance. But ſuch was Circumciſion.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> is clear, becauſe 'tis the Property of all Goſpel-Ordinances to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thoſe that are under them, perfect in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 28. So that the Goſpel-Ordinances are <hi>neither weak nor beggarly;</hi> but as they are a part of the Goſpel it ſelf, are ſaid to be <hi>the Power of God unto Salvation.</hi> The <hi>Minor</hi> is true, becauſe the <hi>Ceremonies of the Law made nothing perfect; for if they had, then they had not ceaſed,</hi> Heb. 7. 18, 19. and 10. 1. And it is evident St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the whole Ceremonial Law (a part whereof was Circumciſion) <hi>beggarly Elements,</hi> Gal. 4. 9. And they are all equally ceaſed.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing upon this Ground the Doctor boldly affirms the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Circumciſion to be an <hi>Evangelical Covenant,</hi> becauſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion did <hi>initiate thereinto,</hi> p. 5. My next Undertaking ſhall be to prove
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:110699:8"/>
that the Covenant of Circumciſion (ſtrictly taken) was no Goſpel-Covenant, though called ſo very frequently by the Doctor, as <hi>p.</hi> 3, and 4. all which he would make good, becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion <hi>a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith,</hi> and becauſe it <hi>ſignified the Circumciſion of the Heart,</hi> Deut. 10. 16. and 30. 6.</p>
            <p>The contrary will appear from the very Recital of the Covenant it ſelf, as ſet down <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. from the Nature of Circumciſion being a Legal Ceremony (as we have proved) and chiefly becauſe the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace was not peculiar to <hi>Abraham</hi> and his, but common to others, though they were not circumciſed.</p>
            <p>To begin with the very Expreſſions of the Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. from <hi>ver.</hi> 4 to 15. Whoſo ſhall diligently read it, will not find one Word of the Promiſe of <hi>Bleſſedneſs to all Nations:</hi> But that Promiſe of the Meſſiah in whom all the Nations of the Earth ſhould be bleſſed was made (as we ſhewed) near thirty Years before this Covenant of Circumciſion was made, But it was rather a<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Cox <hi>on the</hi> Covenants.</note> Recital of God's Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> Gen. 13. when <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> parted aſunder. And indeed of all the eight times which God ſpake to <hi>Abraham,</hi> we find the Promiſe of Bleſſing to all Nations in the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> only expreſſed in the firſt time, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. and in the laſt time that God ſpake to him, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. And yet it is alſo true that St. <hi>Paul</hi> does include <hi>Abraham's</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood over the Faithful in that Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. 5. and 15. 5. And ſo Circumciſion was <hi>to him a Seal of the Faith which</hi> Abraham <hi>had, with reſpect to the Promiſes made at the former Appearings of God to him:</hi> But then it is as true that of <hi>this Faith it</hi> could be no Seal to any other Perſon, no <hi>not to</hi> Iſaac <hi>himſelf,</hi> becauſe it was <hi>Abraham alone</hi> that ſhould have this Honour to be the Father of the Faithful.</p>
            <p>After this manner the ancient Chriſtian Church ſeems to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Covenant of Circumciſion, as appears in <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> and <hi>Theophilact</hi> as tranſlated by two learned Writers in theſe words: <hi>Circumciſion was called a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, becauſe it was given to</hi> Abraham <hi>as a Seal and Teſtimony of the Righteouſneſs which he had acquired by Faith: Now this ſeems to be the Priviledg of</hi> Abraham <hi>alone, and not to be transferred to others, as if Circumciſion in whomſoever it was, were a Teſtimony of Divine Righteouſneſs. For as it was the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledg of</hi> Abraham, <hi>that he ſhould be the Father of all Faithful, as well circumciſed as uncircumciſed, being already the Father of all uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, having Faith in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion: He received firſt the Sign of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, that he might be the Father of the Circumciſed. Now becauſe he</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:110699:8"/>
               <hi>had this Priviledg, in reſpect of the Righteouſneſs which he had acquired by Faith, therefore the Sign of Circumciſion was to him a Seal of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith.</hi> But to the reſt of the Jews it was a Sign <hi>that they were</hi> Abraham'<hi>s Seed, but not a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith, as alſo all the Jews alſo were not the Fathers of many Nations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſays another learned Writer; <q>It is no ways difficult to conceive that Circumciſion might have a different reſpect, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the differing Circumſtances and Capacity of its Subjects; yea that it had ſo in another Inſtance, hath been ſhewed already. It was a Seal of the Inheritance of <hi>Canaan</hi> to the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and did enſure the Promiſe thereof to them, and their Seed; but it gave their Bond-Servants no ſuch right or claim: Even ſo it was to <hi>Abraham</hi> a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of the Faith which he had, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but this aroſe from the peculiar and extraordinary Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and Capacity that he was in. For it is not poſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that Circumciſion ſhould be a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith to one that never had Faith, nor the Relation of a Father to all Believers, as <hi>Abraham</hi> had.—And it is equally abſurd to ſay that Circumciſion was a Seal to all its Subjects of the Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Faith, which they had while uncircumciſed, as to affirm that it was a Seal of a paternal or fatherly Relation to all Believers, unto every one that received it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Again, From St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 6. 15. we may fairly argue thus: If the Covenant of Circumciſion had been the Covenant of Grace, and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion the Sign of the Covenant of Grace (as the Doctor would have it,) then had all true Subjects of it (as ſuch) been new Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Chriſt Jeſus. But the true or right Subjects of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and Sign (as ſuch) were not new Creatures in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This whole Argument is proved from the Text, which ſaith, <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus neither Circumciſion availeth any thing, nor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncircumciſion, but a new Creature.</hi> Plainly thus the Jews were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the better (as to a Goſpel-Church-ſtate) for being the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> or circumciſed: nor the Gentiles never the worſe (as to a Goſpel-ſtate) for being not the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and uncircumciſed. For there was no other way for either to be brought under the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of the Church Evangelical, and ſo to be in Chriſt Jeſus, but by <hi>Repentance, Faith and Baptiſm,</hi> or to <hi>be born again; for if any Man be in Chriſt,</hi> (in a Goſpel-Church-way) <hi>he is a new Creature,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 17. Gal. 3. 26, to the end, and 5. 24. I deſire the Reader to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſe theſe Scriptures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:110699:9"/>We have proved already that Circumciſion was no Goſpel-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, yet we ſhall add, It could not be a Goſpel-Ordinance, becauſe <hi>Moſes</hi> gave it as an Obligation to keep the Ceremonial Law, or that intolerable Yoak of Bondage which <hi>none was able to bear.</hi> For though Circumciſion was before <hi>Moſes,</hi> yet it was given by him, <hi>John</hi> 7. 22. for this purpoſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 2, 3, 4. and it ſelf was a part of the Yoke of Bondage. <hi>Sacrifices</hi> were before <hi>Moſes,</hi> as well as Circumciſion, yet they were given alſo by <hi>Moſes.</hi> And hence when <hi>Paul</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Circumciſion, it was objected that he taught Men to forſake <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Acts</hi> 21. 21. And Circumciſion is expreſly called the <hi>Law of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> by Chriſt himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 7. 23. And therefore the Doctor was not well adviſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to <hi>affirm it to be a Goſpel-Ordinance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, The Covenant of Circumciſion, and the Sign it ſelf were not Evangelical, becauſe the Obligation to be circumciſed was pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and his Seed or Family, in ſuch a ſenſe, <hi>as none but they were obliged to be circumciſed.</hi> Men might and did walk with God, and pleaſe God, without being concerned in the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, as we have fully ſhewed. But <hi>all Men are equally bound to obey the Goſpel,</hi> and all the Ordinances of it, who have means to know them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they do belong to all Families, <hi>all Nations,</hi> as much as to any, <hi>Matth. 28. 19, 20. Mark 16. 15, 16. Rom.</hi> 16. 26. So did not the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Circumciſion.</p>
            <p>How unlike the Covenant of Circumciſion was to the Covenant of Grace, (eſpecially in Reſpect of Infants) might have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Doctor from his own Words, <hi>p.</hi> 8. where he tells us, <hi>God made</hi> Abraham <hi>thus ſeparate the Children with their Parents from all the World, and look upon them, as a part of his choſen peculiar People, by which they became relatively Holy, and differed from the Children of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as much as their Parents did from <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers themſelves.</hi> Sure this is a cruel Sentence againſt poor innocent Babes. But I anſwer.</p>
            <p>What Separation ſoever the Covenant of Circumciſion made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Abraham</hi>'s <hi>Family</hi> and <hi>the reſt of the World;</hi> It is certain it could not ſeparate them, nor any Perſons in the World, from the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace;</hi> there was nothing but Sin could do that, otherwiſe it had been a diſmal Separation indeed. And can the Doctor once think that <hi>Let</hi> was now ſeparated from the Covenant of Grace, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not in the Covenant of Circumciſion?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Brouhgton <hi>Conſent of</hi> Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</note> Sure he was a righteous<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Man for all this. Yea, and other Holy Patriarchs were yet living, as <hi>Heber, Salah,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:110699:9"/>
               <hi>Sem,</hi> and ſo was <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> (if he were not one of them) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prieſt of the moſt high God. And as theſe, and doubtleſs many more, were good Men; ſo it's not to be queſtioned but they had their Holy Societies and Congregations; <hi>Melchiſedec</hi> being then the moſt eminent Type of the Son of God, that ever was, as he was King of Peace, and Prieſt: in which Offices he muſt needs be ſerviceable to many, as is well obſerved by Mr. <hi>Cox</hi> on the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, <hi>p.</hi> 154.</p>
            <p>The Doctor is greatly out in making the Infants of Unbelievers to be in as ill caſe as the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers themſelves,</hi> ſeeing Unbelievers muſt periſh, <hi>Mark.</hi> 16. 16. But it is not revealed yet to be the Will of God that ſo much as one dying Infant ſhall periſh. And as to the reſt of Mankind, Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſays very well; <hi>That as the Jews had by Promiſes and Prophecies and Types, more means to know God than any other Nations, ſo they were anſwerably obliged to more Knowledg and Faith than other Nations were, that had not, nor could have their means.</hi> More Proof, <hi>p.</hi> 95.</p>
            <p>And why may not this be true, That the Effects of the Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Promiſe to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to be a Father of the Faithful in all Nations, had very little Relation in a Goſpel-way, to the Age in which he lived, nor indeed till the times of the Goſpel, or till Chriſt the Seed to whom the Promiſes were made did come? And then indeed it was graciouſly verified, When <hi>by the Commandment of the everlaſting God [even Chriſt who is here ſo called] the Goſpel was made known to all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the Obedience of Faith,</hi> Rom. 16.</p>
            <p>Nor ſhall the Doctor's Allegations, <hi>p. 7. of the great Numbers of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Nations which turned Jews,</hi> prejudice that which we have ſaid, ſeeing St. <hi>Peter</hi> affirms, that the Myſtery of the Goſpel was hid from theſe Nations and Ages, notwithſtanding their Circumciſion. For it is not to be ſuppoſed that theſe who turned Jews were better skill'd in the Myſtery of the new Covenant, or Covenant of Grace, than the Jews themſelves, who (God knows) were generally Strangers to the Steps of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Faith, and therefore little better in our Saviour's Judgment for being <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Children, <hi>John</hi> 8. 37, 39. Nay ſo ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant were the believing Jews themſelves, of the true Seed of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> according to the Nature and Extent of the Covenant, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. That when <hi>Peter</hi> preached to the Gentiles, they contended with him, <hi>as doing that which was not lawful,</hi> for they yet underſtood not that the Grace of Repentance unto Life did belong to the Gentiles; nor did <hi>Peter,</hi> till a Miracle convinc'd him, underſtand this Grace himſelf,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:110699:10"/>
               <hi>Acts</hi> 10. The great Acceſſion therefore of other Nations to the Jews Religion, is no Proof that they were in the Covenant of Grace, or that Circumciſion was a Goſpel-Ordinance: though there might be many among them that ſo feared God, and wrought Righteouſneſs, as to be (through his Mercy) accepted of him; and the like in other Nations [even all Nations] too, <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 34, 35. Yet theſe Acceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons did contribute much to the Fulfilling God's Promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> in other Reſpects; as to make the Name of the God of <hi>Abraham</hi> to be great in the Earth; and alſo to advance the Name of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Friend of God.</p>
            <p>The Doctor tells us, <hi>p. 3. That Faith was the Condition of the Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hamical Covenant; that it was made with</hi> Abraham, <hi>as the Father of the Faithful, and in him with all Believers.</hi> But conſidering what we have proved before with reſpect to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s peculiar Intereſt in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, we may well enquire what Covenant and Faith the Doctor means? ſeeing it could not be the Goſpel-Grace and Faith, which was the Condition of the Covenant <hi>of Circumciſion, as that Covenant belong'd to all that were circumciſed:</hi> Becauſe St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, whilſt the Law was in force (a part of which Law Circumciſion was, as we have proved) <hi>the time of Faith was not yet come.</hi> And that the Jews were <hi>ſhut up to the Faith which was afterward to be revealed,</hi> Gal. 3. 23, 25. And that the Law (a part whereof was Circumciſion) <hi>was added becauſe of Tranſgreſſion, till the Seed</hi> (to wit Chriſt) <hi>ſhould come.</hi> And ſhews likewiſe that there was no Law (as yet) given which could give Life. [<hi>The Covenant of Grace made with</hi> Adam, Gen. 3. <hi>And the Promiſe to</hi> Abraham, Gen. 12. <hi>And the Renewal of the Covenant of Grace to</hi> Noah, <hi>between them both, muſt of Neceſſity be here excepted</hi>] And therefore Eternal Life could not be had by the Covenant and Law of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, as made to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Poſterity, otherwiſe than as it ſerved (as a Type or Figure) to direct them, to look for the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> to be born of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, according to the Fleſh. And therefore the <hi>Promiſe,</hi> ſo much celebrated, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. can by no lawful means be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to the Covenant of Circumciſion, ſtrictly taken; and then all that the Doctor has ſaid to make the <hi>Covenant of Circumciſion a Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Covenant, and Circumciſion a Goſpel-Ordinance,</hi> will come to nothing, and conſequently his whole Book, becauſe it is mainly built upon this Foundation.</p>
            <p>And that the <hi>Promiſe</hi> mentioned by St. <hi>Paul, Gal.</hi> 3. may and ought to be diſtinguiſhed from the Covenant of Circumciſion, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear from the <hi>Date of the Promiſe,</hi> which was 430 Years before the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:110699:10"/>
Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. but the Covenant of Circumciſion wants 25 Years of this account. This is plain to ſuch as will conſider, that that great and bleſſed <hi>Promiſe,</hi> that <hi>in the Seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>all the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the Earth ſhall be bleſſed,</hi> Gen. 12. 3. was at leaſt 25 Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Covenant of Circumciſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. And this is granted by the Learned <hi>Willit,</hi> who in his <hi>Hexapl.</hi> in <hi>Gen.</hi> p. 145. writes thus, <hi>From this Promiſe</hi> (Gen. 12.) <hi>made to</hi> Abraham, <hi>are we to count the 430 Years, which St</hi> Paul <hi>ſaith, were between the Promiſe and the Law,</hi> Gal. 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>and hereunto agreeth the Computation of</hi> Moſes, Exod. 12. 40. <hi>that the Iſraelites dwelt in</hi> Egypt 430 <hi>Years, not in</hi> Egypt <hi>only, but in</hi> Egypt <hi>and</hi> Canaan, <hi>as the Septuagint do interpret the place.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now how this Promiſe had its Effect in the Ages before Chriſt's In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, or how all the Families of the Earth were bleſſed in this promiſed Seed then, God only knoweth: for though the World had a Promiſe of a Saviour from the Beginning, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15. yet that he ſhould be born of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> was not revealed till now. And leſt any ſhould ſtumble at this, that the Promiſe here made, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. was not confirmed till <hi>Abraham,</hi> was circumciſed, he is to remember that St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly teaches the contrary, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 17. as I have ſhewed. And I will add the Judgment of a learned Writer upon the place who writes thus.</p>
            <q>
               <p>That the Goſpel was preached to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and the Covenant of Grace revealed to him, we have aſſerted in ſuch full terms in the Context, as none can rationally doubt thereof; and moreover in verſe 17. we have the time of God's eſtabliſhing this Covenant with him, ſo exactly noted, it was, ſaith the Text, 430 Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the giving of the Law, <hi>viz.</hi> on Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> now the Law was given in a very little time after the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and from the Beginning of the firſt Promiſe to <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> which was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. 3. unto that very Night in which the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were brought out of their Egyptian Bondage, is the Computation of theſe Years made, as will be evident to him that ſhall diligently compare the Chronologie of thoſe times with the expreſs Teſtimony of <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 12. 41. And it came to paſs at the end of 430 Years, even the ſelf-ſame Day, it came to paſs that all the Hoſt of the Lord went out of the Land of <hi>Egypt.</hi> From the time of the firſt Promiſe, to the end of <hi>Iſrael</hi>'s ſojourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> was 430 Years, though their Abode in <hi>Egypt</hi> was not near ſo long.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:110699:11"/>And hence (ſaith he) we collect, that in the Tranſaction of God with <hi>Abraham,</hi> recorded, <hi>Gen.</hi> 12. he did ſolemnly confirm his Covenant with him (although <hi>Moſes</hi> makes not expreſs mention of the term <hi>Covenant,</hi> until occaſion be offered, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 18.) for the Promiſe there mentioned, the Apoſtle-aſſerts to be the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant <hi>confirmed of God in Chriſt unto</hi> Abraham.</p>
            </q>
            <p>The Sum of all that has been ſaid is this, That the Covenant of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion properly taken, is not the Covenant of Grace, or a <hi>Goſpel-Covenant,</hi> nor the Sign thereof Circumciſion a <hi>Goſpel-Ordinance,</hi> as the Doctor maintains and affirms, that Circumciſion did <hi>ſeal to its Subjects the ſame Grace as Baptiſm does now:</hi> which cannot ſtand with Reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe who had been circumciſed, ſhould not then have been bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed for Remiſſion of Sins, for if Circumciſion did ſeal that Grace to its Subjects, why ſhould it be now conferred in Baptiſm? <hi>they came to Baptiſm not as Righteous, but as Sinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Doctor's long Paraphraſe on <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. is rather deſtructive of, than advantagious to Infant-Baptiſm. <hi>For whilſt therein he makes Faith, yea ſuch as enables Men to walk in the Steps of</hi> Abraham'<hi>s Faith,</hi> the abſolute Condition of the Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he can never make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants the Sons and Daughters of <hi>Abraham</hi> by Faith; yet he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to do this by telling us, <hi>that the Faith and Conſent of the Father, or the Godfather, or Congregation under which he was circumciſed, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved of old by the Jews to be imputed to the Child, as his own Faith and Conſent,</hi> 1 Maccab. 2. 46. <hi>They had very good Ground, ſaith he, in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for this their Opinion, becauſe the Infidelity and Diſobedience of the Parents in wilfully neglecting or deſpiſing Circumciſion, was imputed to the Children.</hi> And to ſtrengthen this Jewiſh Doctrine, he brings <hi>Auſtin</hi> with his, <hi>accommodat illis Mater Eccleſia aliorum pedes, ut veniant, alio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum cor ut credunt, aliorum Linguam ut fateantur:</hi> To all which very ſtrange Doctrines we reply;</p>
            <p>By the Doctor's quoting 1 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 2. 46. it appears that the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical Books would afford no Relief for theſe Jewiſh Fables. And he that looks upon the place in <hi>Maccabees,</hi> can find no ground to ſay that the Jews there did circumciſe any Children upon the Faith of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents or God-fathers, for they did not ſtay for Conſent of Parents, but <hi>circumciſed them valiantly, or by Force,</hi> as in the Margin, which I take to be a bad Precedent to be brought into the Chriſtian Church, tho God knows they have been too forward in ſuch violent Proceedings.

            </p>
            <p>As for <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> his Church <hi>accommodating Infants with others Feet to come to be baptized, and with the Hearts of others to believe, and the Tongues of others to confeſs;</hi> it ſhews that in his Judgment Baptiſm ought not to be given, but where 'tis ſought for, and where there is Faith and Confeſſion going before it. But that one may do theſe things for another, that is, one believe, and another to be baptized, we will anſwer it, as <hi>Jerom</hi> did another caſe, <hi>Non credimus, quia non legimus.</hi> We cannot find it ought to be ſo, neither in the Old Teſtament, nor in the New, and therefore we believe it not. And let the Doctor conſider whether upon ſuch Preſumptions as theſe, he may not allow the Feet, Heart, and Mouth of others for the Dead, that they alſo may be baptiſed, from 2 <hi>Maccab.</hi> 12. 43, 44. The Truth is, ſhould we admit the Dictates of the Doctor, in this and many Parts of his Book, it cannot be avoided but that many Innovations and Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions uſed by the Papiſts and others would obtrude upon us.</p>
            <p>In <hi>page</hi> 6, 7. the Doctor tells us, <hi>That the Gentiles, who were born of Gentiles in</hi> Abraham'<hi>s Houſe, or bought with Mony as Servants were, and Blacks are now among us, were the ſpiritual Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Covenant.</hi> And thus alſo he makes <hi>the Medes, Perſians and Idumeans to be conſtituted in the Jewiſh Church by Regeneration, as the Church Chriſtian is;</hi> and calls them the <hi>Spiritual Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were turned Jews, and lived according to the Ceremonies of the Law.</hi> Which how uncertain theſe Dictates are, may be ſeen, when we conſider that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, <hi>the Law is not of Faith;</hi> and that <hi>if</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:110699:12"/>
               <hi>thoſe that are of the Law be Heirs, Faith is made void, and the Promiſe of none Effect.</hi> And how Chriſt calls Circumciſion <hi>the Law of Moſes;</hi> and tells the circumciſed Jews themſelves, that <hi>they muſt be regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and born again, or they could not enter into the Kingdom,</hi> (or Goſpel-Church) which ſhews plainly they were not regenerated in Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and if they were not, then there is little hopes that their Slaves bought with Mony, as Blacks are now by us, had ſuch benefit by Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion.</p>
            <p>Nay, the Doctor is more bold, and tells us, <hi>That always it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood that Children were called and elected by God in their Parents:</hi> which is ſuch a Scriptureleſs Doctrine, and of ſuch dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that we cannot but wonder that ſo wiſe a Man ſhould aſſert it. Does not St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly teach the contrary, where he ſaith, <hi>The Children of the Fleſh are not the Children of God:</hi> And <hi>that all are not Iſrael, that are of Iſrael:</hi> And <hi>though they be the Seed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>yet are they not all Children.</hi> How was it poſſible that he ſhould think that the Slaves and their Children were elected, only becauſe they were circumciſed, when <hi>Abraham</hi>'s own Poſterity are not therefore elected, becauſe <hi>Abraham was their Father,</hi> and alſo circumciſed.</p>
            <p>And will it not follow from the Doctor's Opinion, that Infants are alſo reprobated in their Parents? Yes, he ſays no leſs (I think) when he makes the Unbelievers Infants to differ from thoſe his Elect In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, as much as the Unbelievers themſelves differ from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Parents whom he calls Believers. God be merciful to us, and bleſs us from ſuch Doctrine as this, that his antient way of Truth may be known upon the Earth, and his ſaying Health among the Nations: for <hi>Job</hi> and all holy Men, and poor Infants too which were not circumciſed, might for all that be elected. Seven or eight Pages the Doctor ſpends moſtly to ſhew how Chriſt did alter the <hi>Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy</hi> of the Church in many Particulars, which do not directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our preſent Controverſy, in which there are many Dictates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, about the Reaſons why Chriſt made this Change. But we ſhall content our ſelves in ſetting down theſe two, which he thinks moved our Lord to lay aſide Circumciſion; and his firſt is, Becauſe <hi>by it the Jewiſh Nation was become odious and ridiculous to all other People upon the account of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this Paſſage ſeems to caſt a Scandal upon God himſelf, as that he ſhould appoint any thing that ſhould make his People odious. Sure other Nations had Uſages far more offenſive than this could be, in their Idolatrous Services, and particularly the <hi>burning of their Children to</hi>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:110699:12"/>
               <hi>Moloch.</hi> But the true reaſon why it was laid aſide, was, becauſe the diſtinction which it made between the Seed of <hi>Abraham and other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,</hi> as the <hi>Poſterity from whence Christ ſhould proceed,</hi> was now unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, becauſe <hi>Chriſt was born</hi> and manifeſted to the World: and chiefly becauſe the Ceremonial Law to which it was a ſtrong Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and alſo a part of it was now to be diſannulled and taken out of the way, as an Handwriting of Ordinances, which was againſt us, and was contrary to us; <hi>Heb. 7. 18, 19. Coloſſ. 2. 14. Acts</hi> 15. 10. it was therefore meet it ſhould be taken away.</p>
            <p>His ſecond Reaſon is more tolerable, but yet not true, for though Circumciſion was a painful Ordinance, yet the Goſpel requires as painful things as that was, of all that will be Chriſtians indeed, as the <hi>denying a Man's ſelf;</hi> and particularly in parting with <hi>Houſe, Land, Wife, Children,</hi> a <hi>right Hand,</hi> a <hi>right Eye,</hi> a <hi>right Foot,</hi> and <hi>our very Life,</hi> when God calls for them, in ſervice to the Defence of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. Yea, let me tell the Doctor, had he come to Baptiſm it ſelf, after the Example of Chriſt, who came from <hi>Galilee</hi> to <hi>Jordan</hi> (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe 60 Miles) and that in the depth of Winter, to be dipped in a River, as Chriſt was in <hi>Jordan,</hi> he might poſſibly have found it as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful to Fleſh and Blood as ſome have found it to part with their Foreskin; and add to this ſuch Repentance as truly qualifies for the Reception of Baptiſm, and the whole of it might poſſibly ſeem as ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous in the Eyes of the wiſe Men of this World, as Circumciſion it ſelf.</p>
            <p>We conclude then that the Wiſdom of God was great to try the Pride and Haughtineſs of Man, in appointing Circumciſion in the Time of the Law, to bring Men to Legal Priviledges. And it is no leſs his Wiſdom in appointing Baptiſm, to bring down the Pride of the greateſt Nobles, and moſt delicate Ladies, (as well as others) by ſubmitting their Bodies under the Hands of a poor Miniſter to be dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped in Water, at all Seaſons, as they are found qualified for it by Faith and Repentance, to admit them to Goſpel-Priviledges.</p>

            <p>IN <hi>pag.</hi> 18. the Doctor ſays, <q>Hitherto I have given the Reaſons of altering the Jewiſh Oeconomy—But then my Undertaking ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liges me to prove that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did build with many of the old Materials, and conformed their new Houſe as much as they could after the Platform of the Old. This will appear from Baptiſm it ſelf, which was a Ceremony by which Proſelytes both Men and Women and Children were initiated; yet ſo much Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect had our Saviour for the antient Orders and Cuſtoms of the Jewiſh Church, that being obliged to lay by Circumciſion, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated this inſtead of it (though it were but a meer human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution) to be the Sacrament of Initiation into his Church, and a Seal of the Righteouſneſs of Faith. So likewiſe the Lord's Supper was certainly of Jewiſh Original.</q>

            <div type="answer">
               <head>Anſwer.</head>
               <p>This Doctrine, that Chriſt and his Apoſtles did build their new Houſe of the old Materials of the Jewiſh Church, and that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd their new Houſe as much as they could to the Platform of the Old, ſeems to hold no Agreement with the Doctrine and Practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, whether we conſider the Subjects, Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, or Miniſtery of the Church.</p>
               <p>The Doctrine and Miniſtery of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, is called <hi>the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Goſpel,</hi> Mark 1. 1. And he would not admit of one Stone (or Member of the old Church) as ſuch, to be laid into the Goſpel-Church. Begin not <hi>to ſay within your ſelves, we have</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham <hi>to our Father. God is able of theſe Stones to raiſe up Children unto</hi> Abraham. <hi>Bring forth Fruits meet for Repentance. Every Tree which bringeth not forth good Fruit is hewn down.</hi> Matth. 3. So great a Change do we find, that the old Materials, in reſpect of Memberſhip in the new Houſe, would not do, when yet there was but an Introduction, to make ready a People prepared for the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:110699:13"/>Chriſt came to fulfil the Ceremonies of the Law, and to nail them to his Croſs, as we have ſhewed, not to eſtabliſh them in his Church. But the Truth is, whoever revives them, pulls down his Church. And it were the falſe Apoſtles, that would have conformed the Church of Chriſt to the Platform of the old Jewiſh Church, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 5. But the true Apoſtles withſtood them, and decreed that the new Church ſhould obſerve <hi>no ſuch things,</hi> but they eſtabliſh what the Light of Grace, and the poſitive Law of God had made neceſſary before to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. 23 to 30. <hi>Gen.</hi> 9. 4. Thus far were the Apoſtles from building the Church of Chriſt with Jewiſh Materials: That as the great <hi>Curcellaeus</hi> ſays, <q>The Apoſtle writ that Epiſtle to let the Gentiles know they were freed from <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Law, leſt by their hearing him read every Sabbath, they might think they were bound to obey his Laws.</q> And it is ſtrange that the Doctor ſhould now make <hi>Chriſt and his Apoſtles Anabaptiſts,</hi> as he does, for he will have them to have been <hi>baptiſed as well as circumciſed, to initiate them into the Jewiſh Church;</hi> and he will have that very Baptiſm conſecrated by Chriſt inſtead of Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, to <hi>initiate into his Church;</hi> ſure he has little reaſon to write againſt Anabaptiſm, when he is one of the greateſt Aſſerters of it that ever was: but more of this pretended Baptiſm anon.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>Paul</hi> above all the reſt, rejects the old Materials, and builds all with new; <hi>Old things are paſſed away, behold all things are become new,</hi> 2 Cor. 5. <hi>There is verily a diſannulling of the Commandment going before for the Weakneſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nprofitableneſs thereof,</hi> Heb. 7. 18. He calls the whole Maſs of Jewiſh Ceremonies, <hi>Beggarly Elements.</hi> And is it like that he would build the Goſpel-Church with ſuch Materials? much leſs with that ſuppoſed Baptiſm of Jewiſh Proſelytes, or of Jews them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which the Doctor knows was at beſt but of Mans Inſtitution.</p>
               <p>Let us view the old Jewiſh Church, and the new Goſpel-Church in a few Particulars brieſly. The Members of the Jewiſh Church were <hi>Natural,</hi> called natural Branches, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. that is, they were the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Fleſh. The Members of the Chriſtian Church <hi>are ſpiritual,</hi> grafted contrary to Nature into the good Olive, and born of God.</p>
               <p>The Circumciſion of the Jewiſh Church was <hi>outward in the Fleſh, made with Hands.</hi> The Circumciſion of the Goſpel-Church is <hi>that of the Heart, in the Spirit, made without Hands, in putting off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh by the Circumciſion of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Their <hi>Sacrifices were carnal,</hi> carnal Ordinances, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. Our <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices are Spiritual,</hi> 1 Pet. 2. 2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:110699:14"/>Their Miniſters were choſen <hi>of one Family or Tribe, and did ſucceed by natural Deſcent:</hi> and were Miniſters of the Letter. Ours <hi>are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by Christ, as the Fruit of his Aſcenſion into Heaven,</hi> and are <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Spirit,</hi> Epheſ. 4.</p>
               <p>Their two Sacraments ſerved chiefly to <hi>ſeal their Right to the Land of Canaan,</hi> and that the Meſſiah ſhould come of the Seed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> according to the Fleſh; and to <hi>commemorate their Deliverance out of Egypt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ours ſeal <hi>Remiſſion of Sins by Faith in the Blood of Jeſus,</hi> and our <hi>Inheritance in the Kingdom of Heaven</hi> to all Eternity.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, <hi>Their Services made nothing perfect,</hi> Heb. 10.</p>
               <p>Ours preſent <hi>every Man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Col. 1. 28.</p>
               <p>But let us come to this pretended <hi>Inſant-Baptiſm among the Jews,</hi> which is ſo much made uſe of by the Doctor, as if it were the very thing that muſt give Life to Inſant-Baptiſm in the Chriſtian Church. And indeed Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> (from whom this Doctor ſeems to borrow much) makes the Jewiſh baptizing of Proſelytes the <hi>Original,</hi> and ours but the <hi>Copy.</hi> That our Saviour ſhould thus highly approve of a Jewiſh Ceremony, as to conſecrate it to be the initiatory Sacrament into his Church, is no way to be believed. For he condemned all ſuch Ceremonies of their own deviſing to be but vain Worſhip, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15. 9. and will he then eſtabliſh this their Tradition (if indeed they had any ſuch)? The Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> was that which he eſtabliſhed, both by his own Submiſſion to it, and Divine Teſtimony concerning it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3. 15. &amp; 21. 25. Nor did <hi>John</hi> take up his Baptiſm from the Jews, as many Learned Men of the Church of <hi>England</hi> do teach of late. For he was a Prophet immediately ſent of God to baptize with Water, <hi>John</hi> 1. 33. And he that ſays <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſm was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally of the Jews, as this Doctor and Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> do teach, denies <hi>John</hi> to be a Prophet, and does diſſent herein from many Learned Proteſtant Writers, whoſe Teſtimonies I will therefore here bring againſt them, who with one Mouth bear witneſs that <hi>John</hi>'s Miniſtry and Baptiſm was Evangelical, and not <hi>Ligal, Jewiſh,</hi> or of his <hi>own deviſing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Diodate</hi> on <hi>John 1. 6. Divine Light being now extinguiſhed, the Son of God himſelf came into the World to light it again by the Goſpel, whereof</hi> John <hi>the Baptiſt was the firſt Preacher:</hi> And on Matth. 11. 13. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Prerogative above the precedent Prophets is, they have only foretold and deſcribed things to come, but he declared the preſent Salvation, and in him began the Evangelical Miniſtery, and the Legal and figurative Miniſtery</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:110699:14"/>
                  <hi>ceaſed.</hi> This could not be true, had he taken his Baptiſm from the Jewiſh Church.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Willit</hi> in his <hi>Synopſis;</hi> John <hi>preached the Baptiſm of Repentance for the Remiſſion of Sins, which was all one with the Baptiſm of</hi> Peter, Act. 2. 38. <hi>And it is abſurd that Chriſt the Head, and the Church the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſhould not have the ſame Baptiſm.</hi> And <hi>that</hi> John'<hi>s Baptiſm was not of</hi> John'<hi>s deviſing, but of God's Appointment,</hi> Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> on <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.</p>
               <p>Dr. <hi>Fulk.</hi> John <hi>by his Doctrine and Baptiſm prepared a way to Chriſt, not to the Baptiſm of Chriſt, for he preached not his own Baptiſm, but the waſhing away of Sins by Chriſt. Therefore he alſo was a Miniſter of the Baptiſm of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This new Device of founding the Chriſtian Baptiſm upon Jewiſh Baptiſm is dangerous, opening a Gap to the Quakers, and other Notioniſts to contemn it as a Legal Ceremony. Yet the Doctor bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tells us, <hi>That Chriſt was obliged to lay by Circumciſion, and conſecrated this Ceremony</hi> (uſed by the Jews) <hi>inſtead of it.</hi> The Enemies of Chriſt durſt not ſay as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> and this Doctor does ſay, that the Baptiſm of <hi>John</hi> was of <hi>Jewiſh Original.</hi> They knew ſuch a Speech muſt deny <hi>John to be a Prophet.</hi> And yet theſe Learned Men have not Learning enough to conſider this.</p>
               <p>We know the Phariſees were very zealous for the Traditions of the Jewiſh Church, but it's certain they had no Zeal for the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm of Repentance, for they rejected it againſt themſelves, <hi>Luke</hi> 7. 20. And here this holy Ordinance is expreſly called the Counſel of God, which ſhews it was not originally a Rite or Ceremony of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Inſtitution, or Jewiſh Ceremony.</p>
               <p>But now let us ſee whether the Doctor may not poſſibly be miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in aſſerting that the Jews had ſuch a Ceremony as Baptiſm among them before <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt came. And in this Enquiry we will prefer a Learned Proteſtant of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who writes thus:</p>

                  <p>As to their Argument who would have our Baptiſm to<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sir</hi> Norton Knatchbul.</note> be derived from the Jewiſh Lotions, as there is nothing of certainty in it, ſo it is ſo far from being grounded on any Authority in Scripture, that there are hardly any Footſteps to be found thereof in the Old Teſtament. They deduce the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Baptiſm from the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which ſignifies to waſh or cleanſe. But the Rabbins, if I am not deceived, uſe the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, which ſignifies Immerſion, thereby making it appear that they owe the Notion of the Word to the Greeks, or rather to the Chriſtians. For what affinity is there between Lotion and
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:110699:15"/>
Immerſion? But the thing is ſo uncertain, that it cannot be ſaid of the Rabbins, that there were not ſeveral among them who differed very much about this matter.—</p>
                  <p>For in the very place cited by the forementioned Learned Men, <hi>Rabbi Eliezer</hi> expreſly contradicts <hi>Rabbi Joſhua,</hi> who was the firſt that I know of, who aſſerted this ſort of Baptiſm among the Jews. Now to whom ſhall I give credit? To <hi>Eliezer,</hi> who aſſerts what the Scripture confirms [meaning that <hi>Proſelytes were not bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed</hi>] or to <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who affirms what is no where to be found in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture [meaning this pretended Baptiſm is <hi>not to be found in Scripture.</hi>] But the Rabbins upheld <hi>Joſhua</hi>'s ſide, and what wonder was it? for it made for their buſineſs, that is, for the Honour of the Jewiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>That the Chriſtians ſhould borrow their Ceremonies,</hi> [how im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent then is the Author of the Book we are anſwering, to give this Advantage to the Jews againſt the Chriſtians.] But when I ſee Men of great Learning fetching the Foundation of Truth from the <hi>Rabbins,</hi> I cannot but heſitate a little. For whence was this <hi>Talmud</hi> ſent to us,—that we ſhould give ſo much credit thereto—? for the <hi>Talmud</hi> is called a <hi>Labyrinth of Errors, and the Foundation of Jewiſh Fables.</hi> [This is then a Fault in the Church of <hi>England</hi> Doctors to fly hither for Refuge for Infant-Baptiſm.] It was brought to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection 500 years after Chriſt. [This ſhews the danger of truſting to it, it being ſo lately confirmed.] Therefore it is unreaſonable to reſt upon the Teſtimony of it. And that which moves me moſt, <hi>Joſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phus</hi>—who was alſo a Jew, and contemporary with <hi>Rabbi Eliezer,</hi> who alſo wrote in particular of the Rites, Cuſtoms and Acts of the Jews, <hi>is altogether ſilent in this matter.</hi> [He knew no baptiſing of Infants among the Jews] So that it is an Argument to me next to a Demonſtration, that two ſuch eminent Perſons, both Jews, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving at the ſame time, the one ſhould <hi>poſitively deny,</hi> the other <hi>make no mention</hi> of Baptiſm among the Jews.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if Baptiſm in the modern ſenſe were in uſe among the Jews in antient times, why did the Phariſees ask <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt, <hi>Why doſt thou baptize, if thou be not Chriſt, nor Elias, nor that Prophet?</hi> Do they not plainly intimate, that Baptiſm was not in uſe before, and that it was a received Opinion among them, that there ſhould be no Baptiſm till either <hi>Chriſt, or Elias,</hi> or that <hi>Prophet</hi> came? How then there ſhould be ſo much affinity between Baptiſm and the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings of the Jews, that the one ſhould be ſucceſſive to the other by any Right or Pretence, is altogether I confeſs, beyond my Faith.</p>
               </q>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:110699:15"/>It appears from this learned Man's Diſcourſe, that there is no Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that the Jews had any ſuch Baptizing of Infants, or others, as the Doctor pretends. However, God having appointed no ſuch thing in the Jewiſh Church, leaves ſuch a Practice (if they had it) without any Authority to govern Chriſtians in their Adminiſtration of Baptiſm. Nor do we who aſſert the Ordinance according to the Scripture, need to run for Counſel to the Jews <hi>Talmud, Gemara,</hi> and <hi>Maimonides.</hi> And indeed it looks too much like going to the <hi>Witch of Endur,</hi> and to <hi>Baalzebub</hi> the God of <hi>Ekron</hi> for Knowledg, as if there were not ſufficient Inſtruction in the undoubted Word of God, how or to whom to diſpence the firſt Ordinance of the Goſpel to a poor Convert. And it is a ſure ſign that the Doctor and all that make ſuch a noiſe about this <hi>Rabbinical</hi> Learning to juſtify them in the caſe of infant Baptiſm, are conſcious to themſelves<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they have no ſure Footing in God's Word for it.</p>
               <p>And yet ſo partial are our <hi>Talmudiſts,</hi> that they will not follow its Directions for the manner of Baptiſm, which as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> ſhews is commonly expreſſed by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>Immerſion,</hi> never by <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that is, Aſperſion or Sprinkling; for ſuch as will not be true to the Rules given in the Holy Scripture, how ſhould they be true to any other Book?</p>
               <p>One thing I marvel at, <hi>p.</hi> 20. where the Doctor tells his Reader that <hi>the Anabaptiſts endeavour to ſhift off the force of many good Arguments, by ſaying Circumciſion under the Old Teſtament was a Type of Baptiſm un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New.</hi> For this I take to be a great Miſtake of the Doctor, I never heard of any, whom he calls Annabaptiſts, who hold Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion to be a Type of Baptiſm at all. But I have met with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> who have affirmed it to be a Type of Baptiſm; ſo that all that the Doctor ſays upon this Miſtake about which he ſpent ſome Pages, is nothing to the purpoſe. For we own no other Antitype of Circumciſion, but the Circumciſion of the Heart, called <hi>the Circumciſion of Chriſt made without Hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But had he minded well his own Book, he might have ſeen Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> aſſerting the thing which he would charge upon us, where he ſaith, <hi>The Apoſtles did attemperate all their doings to the Shadows and Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures of the Old Teſtament. Therefore it is certain they did attemperate Baptiſm to Circumciſion, and baptize Children becauſe they were under the Figure of Baptiſm, for the People of</hi> Iſrael <hi>paſſed through the Red-Sea,</hi> &amp;c. Where I think he makes both Circumciſion, and paſſing through the Sea, to be Shadows and Types of Baptiſm; which is yet more evident, becauſe (a little before) he tells us that <hi>Paul calls Baptiſm the Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:110699:16"/>
                  <hi>made without Hands.</hi> Which though it be not true, ſeeing all Men know, and Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> cannot deny but Baptiſm is made by Hands, yet it ſhews that he looked upon Baptiſm to be the Antitype of Circumciſion. But I ſhall not fight with dead Men, otherwiſe I might ſhew his Miſtake in ſaying that the Apoſtles did attemperate all their<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doings to the Shadows and Figures of the Old Teſtament: but this we have ſhewed before, to be an unſound Speech.</p>
               <p>The Doctor ſeems to deal unfairly with <hi>Col. 2. 11, 12. Circumciſion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>hath nothing in it ſymbolical of Baptiſm, and denies it to be an umbratical, but areal Conſignation of the Covenant of Grace;</hi> quoting the Text thus, <hi>In whom alſo they are circumciſed,</hi> with the Circumciſion made without Hands, in putting off the <hi>Body of the Sins of the Fleſh by the Circumciſion of Chriſt; Having been buried with him in Baptiſm.</hi> Does not the Doctor by this Addition to the Text, aſſert the thing which he would deny, or elſe denies what <hi>Paul</hi> aſſerts, for St. <hi>Paul</hi> does make Circumciſion a Shadow or Figure of the Circumciſion of Chriſt made without Hands, why elſe does he call the Work of Grace in the Heart by that Name of Circumciſion, as he alſo doth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 29? But the Doctor does refer this Circumciſion to Baptiſm, <hi>having been</hi> buried with him in Baptiſm: but then if this be his meaning, Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion muſt needs have ſomething in it umbratical of Baptiſm, which yet he denies, and therein contradicts Mr. <hi>Philpot,</hi> who affirms even Baptiſm to be the Circumciſion made without Hands.</p>
               <p>The Truth is, this Text can never be made ſerviceable to Infant-Baptiſm, as Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi> and the Doctor would have it; ſeeing no more are here ſaid to be baptized, than had put off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh. Nor, as we have it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. no more are here buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm, than were dead with him. And this alone might ſerve to ſhew that God expects not, that Infants ſhould be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, ſeeing they can neither die to Sin, nor riſe to Newneſs of Life, and to what purpoſe they ſhould be buried before they be dead, no good reaſon can be ſhewed.</p>
               <p>Here we are told again, that <hi>Circumciſion was a real Conſignation of the Covenant of Grace, every way as real and ſubſtantial an Ordinance as Baptiſm is now.</hi> It is only called a Seal in the ſpecial caſe of <hi>Abraham.</hi> And if it was every way as real and ſubſtantial as Baptiſm is now, to what end were the Circumciſed baptized alſo in the Jewiſh Church, as the Doctor ſays they were? And why does <hi>Paul</hi> call it a beggarly Element? And how could it be the Yoke of Bondage, or the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it, and a Seal of the Covenant of Grace too? A Seal or Sign
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:110699:16"/>
of the Covenant of Grace frees Men from the Yoke of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Bondage; and of this, Evangelical Baptiſm is a real and ſubſtantial Conſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, where the Subject is qualified for it. Had Circumciſion been ſuch a real and ſuſtantial Ordinance to conſign the Covenant of Grace, it would not have ceaſed, if St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Argument hold, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 1, 2. But it is aboliſhed as well as other Ceremonies of the Law, which is a ſign it did not make the Comers thereunto perfect, any more than the other Legal Ceremonies. Whereas had it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd the Covenant of Grace, more could not be expected from a ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual to make the Subjects of it perfect. And this Perfection have the Ordinances of the Goſpel, as we have ſhewed before, but here the Ceremonies of the Law failed.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Wherein the Doctor's firſt Queſtion is anſwered, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether Infants are capable of Baptiſm?</head>
            <p>THE Doctor counts it <hi>Raſhneſs to deny Infants to be capable of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Nothing can reflect more Diſhonour upon the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God, and the Practice of the Jewiſh Church.</hi> And the Sum of what he brings to prove them capable of Baptiſm, is to repeat what he has ſaid before, about <hi>the Identity of the Covenant of Circumciſion, and that which is made with us in the Goſpel;</hi> and concludes, that <hi>becauſe Infants were admitted to Circumciſion, therefore they are to be admitted to Baptiſm;</hi> and affirms <hi>that Circumciſion was as ſpiritual an Ordinance as Baptiſm,</hi> yea <hi>that it was a Goſpel-Ordinance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore I repeat the ſame things which I have ſaid before, the Reader will (I hope) hear with that; for Anſwer then, I ſay, though we deny not but that the Covenant of Circumciſion did comprehend all thoſe Dignities which pertain'd to <hi>Abraham,</hi> for the Greatneſs of his Faith, to be the Father of many Nations; yet every Man that reads and conſiders the Tenor of the Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as ſet down, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. may eaſily ſee theſe things belonged to none but him, and therefore Circumciſion could ſeal the Righteouſneſs of Faith in thoſe peculiar Promiſes (whether we conſider <hi>the numerouſneſs of his Seed,</hi> or that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:110699:17"/>
               <hi>Chriſt ſhould be born of his Seed,</hi> and ſo the <hi>Nations bleſſed in his Seed</hi>) but to <hi>Abraham</hi> only, becauſe none of theſe Promiſes were made to any but to him.</p>
            <p>We have alſo ſhewed how and in what reſpects the Covenant of Circumciſion could not be the Covenant of Grace, becauſe <hi>none but</hi> Abraham'<hi>s Family was bound to keep it;</hi> nor damned, no nor blamed, if they did not enter into it: but the caſe is otherwiſe with the Goſpel: for now God <hi>commandeth</hi> (by the Goſpel) <hi>all Men every where to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and he that believeth not the Goſpel</hi> (when made known to him) <hi>ſhall be damned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Can it enter into the Doctor's Heart to think that all the World was now left under Condemnation without Mercy, except <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Family? Surely it was not in the Days of <hi>Abraham,</hi> as it was in the Days of <hi>Noah,</hi> as if God had only found <hi>Abraham</hi> righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous before him in all the Earth. No we have proved there were other righteous Men, and ſome ſuperiour to <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf: wherefore God's peculiar Kindneſs to <hi>Abraham,</hi> did not argue that God had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, and taken the Covenant of Grace from all the World beſides, but it is certainly a preſumptuous way of arguing, that becauſe God made Infants of eight days old capable of Circumciſion, by his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to circumciſe them, that therefore we ought to take them to be capable of Baptiſm, tho we have no Command to baptize them; and then fly to the Identity of the Covenants to make it good, when there is no Identity at all to be found between them. But to conceſs a little.</p>
            <p>Let us now ſuppoſe (for Argument ſake) that the Covenant of Circumciſion was the Covenant of Grace, as the Doctor would have it; yet it will not follow that an Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace does infer an immediate Right always, either to Circumciſion or Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm: and this the Doctor muſt grant, becauſe Infants of five, ſix, or ſeven days old had an Intereſt in the Covenant made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> and yet had no right to Circumciſion till the eighth day. Alſo the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of the other Patriarchs had an Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace, yet had no right to Circumciſion at all. Nor could they, nor the Patriarchs themſelves, be cut off from the Covenant of Grace, tho they were not circumciſed. And all the Females of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily had Intereſt in the Covenant of Grace, but had no right to Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion; and the reaſon was, God did not appoint them to be cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed. And yet ſo fooliſh have ſome Nations been as to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe Females without any command from God, and therefore its leſs
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:110699:17"/>
ſtrange that Men now force on their Superſtition of Infant Baptiſm, without God's Command alſo.</p>
            <p>But what if all the Infants in the World be under the Mercy of the new Covenant, as it reſpects the Abolition of the condemning Power of Original Sin, and Gift of eternal Life: as I think whatever the Doctor ſays at ſome turns, yet he will grant me this (at leaſt for the ſubſtance of it) for all that die in Infancy; yet he will not ſay that all Infants in the World in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s time, who were Males, ought to be circumciſed, or that all Infants in the World ſince Chriſt's time are to be baptized. And therefore ſuppoſe the Covenant of Grace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, in, and ſince the Law, to be the ſame, yet it's clear that an immediate Right to the Mercy of the Covenant, (in the ſenſe before explained) does not infer an immediate right to partake of Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, but ſome other particular Qualifications; and God's Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on muſt give immediate right to participate of them, or elſe we act and do we know not what.</p>
            <p>Let us then calmly conſider what were the neceſſary Qualifications for Circumciſion, and what are the neceſſary Qualifications for Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and then we ſhall ſoon be able to anſwer this Queſtion, <hi>Whether Infants are capable of Baptiſm.</hi> Infants Qualifications for Circumciſion were theſe; They muſt be the Seed of <hi>Abraham</hi> according to the Fleſh, or born in his Houſe, or bought with Money, or the Children of Proſelytes, and they muſt be Males; and they muſt be eight days old, elſe they could not lawfully be circumciſed; I ſay, it was not all Infants (as ſuch) that might lawfully be circumciſed, but Infants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch Circumſtances or Qualifications. Wherefore in the next place let us conſider the indiſpenſible Qualifications for Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>And here I ſhall chiefly make uſe of that Text, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 11, 12. ſo much inſiſted on by the Doctor, with its parallel place, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3. From theſe Texts it plainly appears that Baptiſm is a myſtical Burial; and therefore every one of the faln Race of Mankind which are lawfully baptized, are <hi>buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm.</hi> So then there is an indiſpenſible Neceſſity that all who are to be thus buried, be firſt dead; for it is directly againſt theſe Scriptures, and againſt all Reaſon and Religion, to bury any Perſon before they be dead.</p>
            <p>The Queſtion therefore is what Death is here meant. It cannot be a <hi>corporal Death,</hi> for then none but dead Bodies ſhould be baptized, which is abſurd. Nor can it be a <hi>Death in Sin;</hi> for if that did qualify for Baptiſm, then all unregenerate Perſons were fit Subjects for Baptiſm, but that alſo is abſurd: It muſt therefore <hi>be a Death to Sin, and to</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:110699:18"/>
               <hi>the Rudiments of the World.</hi> And thus does St. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf expound it; <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to Sin, live any longer therein,</hi> Rom. 6. 11. <hi>Wherefore reckon your ſelves to be dead indeed unto Sin, but alive unto God.</hi> Col. 2. 20. <hi>Dead with Chriſt from the Rudiments of the World.</hi> This is that Death which is ſo abſolutely neceſſary to the Baptiſmal Covenant, that the Doctor knows it to be granted by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> that Repentance whereby we forſake Sin, (which is the ſame thing which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls a Death to Sin) is required of all that are to be baptized.</p>
            <p>Another indiſpenſible Qualification, is, every Subject of Baptiſm ought firſt to be a Child of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus; or to be a new Creature. Hence it is ſaid of the whole Church Militant, <hi>Ye are all the Sons of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> for <hi>as many as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3. And as every Member of this Church is ſaid to be buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm; ſo they are <hi>ſaid therein to be riſen with him through Faith.</hi> And to this alſo the Church of <hi>England</hi> gives Teſtimony, <hi>that Faith is required of all that are to be baptized,</hi> even ſuch Faith as whereby the <hi>Promiſes of God made in that Sacrament are ſtedfaſtly to be believed.</hi> And that it's neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the Party baptized be a new Creature, they boldly affirm, when they have ſprinkled the Infant, (when perhaps faſt aſleep) <hi>that he is born of the Spirit,</hi> &amp;c. And that to be born again, is a neceſſary Qualification for Baptiſm. The Word of God is clear, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. where Baptiſm is called <hi>the Waſhing of Regeneration.</hi> And St. <hi>Peter</hi> calls it the Anſwer of a good Conſcience. And unto this Doctrine all the ancient Writers of Chriſtianity agree with full conſent.</p>
            <p>And for Brevities ſake, as alſo becauſe <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is thought to be as eminent as any of the Fathers that were before him, and more emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent then any that did ſucceed him, I will content my ſelf with his Teſtimony, who ſaith, <hi>Per fidem renaſcimur in Baptiſmate;</hi> by Faith we are born again in <hi>Baptiſm, Serm.</hi> 53. And again, <hi>Primo fides Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca Chriſtiano neceſſaria eſt, per ipſum renaſcimur in baptiſmate &amp; Salutem aeternam impetramus;</hi> firſt of all the Catholick Faith is neceſſary for all Chriſtians, by the which in Baptiſm we are born again to obtain eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>And that Infants have not Faith, he teſtifies in theſe Words; <hi>Si illis minati eſſent ipſum Baptiſmum <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſuſciperent, cui videmus cos cum magnis ſtetibus reluctari.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From theſe Premiſes I think we may ſafely conclude that Infants are not capable of Baptiſm; for what Man with any Truth or Fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:110699:18"/>
of Diſcourſe is ever able to bring Infants under theſe Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or to ſhew that Baptiſm may lawfully be adminiſtred to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of whom we can have no Knowledg, nor Evidence from them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that there is any thing of theſe Prerequiſites to Holy Baptiſm, but as far as they are able (<hi>Auguſtine</hi> being witneſs) they do oppoſe and withſtand it. <hi>If Infants were illuminate, they would gladly receive Baptiſm, which we ſee them ſtrive againſt with great crying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all that <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or the Doctor can ſay in this caſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> amounts but to this; That Infants do perform this Repentance, and Faith by their Godfathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is ſo poor an Anſwer, ſo dellitute of Divine Warrant, that it is to be lamented, that ever wiſe Men ſhould ſatisfy themſelves with ſuch a Speech, as no Man can know to be true, but by all Experience is found to be falſe, inſomuch that no Man could ever yet (I ſuppoſe) give Thanks to God for that Faith and Repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which their Godfathers per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed for them, nor do the Godfathers themſelves know that they do the Infant any good, in or by any Supply the Infant does receive from them in reſpect of Repentance or Faith.</p>
            <p>But <hi>p.</hi> 24. the Doctor proceeds thus; <hi>If the relative Nature of Circumciſion, conſidered as a Sacrament, was the ſame under the Law that Baptiſm is under the Goſpel, it muſt needs follow that Children under the Goſpel are as capable of this (ſuppoſing no new Command to exclude them) as under the Law they were of that.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But by the Doctor's favour we do not exclude Children from Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, but bring them to it as ſoon as lawfully we can, but we muſt not make more haſte than good ſpeed, nor outrun the Rule which God has given to direct us. Now theſe Words [Exclude Infants from Baptiſm] are rather ſcandalous than pertinent. Does the Doctor exclude Children from the Lord's Table, becauſe he does not bring them to Communion there in their Infancy? ſure he does what he can to bring them to obey God in that Ordinance with what ſpeed he lawfully may, and ſo do we in the caſe of Baptiſm. As for the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Nature of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> though it was no Abſurdity to make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants Members of the Jewiſh Church by it, when God bad them do ſo; yet had any Man taken upon him to have made them Members of the Church in the old World by ſuch a Sign, it would have been ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd enough. It was no Abſurdity for <hi>Abraham</hi> to offer up his Son <hi>Iſaac,</hi> to ſlay him with his own Hand, when God did command it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but it would be Abſurdity to purpoſe for us to do ſo, having no ſuch Command; and yet we are to ſacrifice all that's dear to us, even our
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:110699:19"/>
own Lives, but it muſt be in ſuch a way as God requireth. This talk therefore of the relative Nature of Circumciſion is very vain; we ſay did the Lord require us to baptize our Infants, and to give them the Communion, there could be no Abſurdity in either, but then he would have diverſified the time for Participation of theſe Ordinances, as he did in the caſe of Circumciſion for the <hi>8th</hi> day; though it was the preciſe time for the Admiſſion of Infants, yet it was no rule at all to the <hi>Adulti.</hi> Shew now that God has required Baptiſm at a preciſe day to the younger ſort, and prefixed no preciſe day of Age to the elder ſort (for thus he did in the Circumciſion) and the Diſpute will ſoon end.</p>
            <p>Circumciſion did relate neceſſarily to all Servants bought with Mony in <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Houſe, as Members of his Houſe, but the caſe is not ſuch in Baptiſm. And it was yet never proved that thoſe Perſons who were thus circumciſed, were to be qualified for it by Faith and Repentance; but it rather ſeems to have been done at firſt in <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s Houſe, either in Obedience to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Authority over them, as his Bondmen, Servants, or Child; or elſe by plain force: for ſeeing <hi>Abraham</hi> circumciſed all his that very day, they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> had little time to have Faith and Repentance wrought in them; nor is there one word of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s preaching any thing to them. But 'tis ſaid, <hi>He took</hi> Iſmael <hi>his Son and circumciſed him, and all that were born in his Houſe, and all that were bought with Mony—every Male—the ſelf<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſame day.</hi> Here was bloody Work; and Dr. <hi>Willit</hi> thinks the Number of the <hi>Males was ſo many that</hi> Abraham <hi>could not circumciſe them in one day, and that he uſed the help of others to do it.</hi> And what Faith and Repentance could be expected from <hi>Iſhmael</hi> at 13 Years of Age, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering that he was not the Child of Promiſe, nor to have the Covenant eſtabliſhed with him.</p>
            <p>And who will ſay that <hi>Abraham,</hi> or the Jewiſh Church either, had any Commiſſion from God to teach all Nations, circumciſing them? this way he never went; but if he bought any of them, them he would and did circumciſe. And where is the new Birth made the Qualification for Circumciſion? No Man can give an Inſtance of it. But nothing is more common in the caſe of Baptiſm: ſurely the plain Truth in ſhort is this: <hi>Circumciſion did relate generally to a carnal Seed, and to a Terreſtrial Inheritance; but Baptiſm relates only to a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Seed, and a Celeſtial Inheritance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And let not the Doctor reflect upon us (as he does <hi>p.</hi> 27.) but we pray the Doctor to conſider whether God was not as wiſe, and had as
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:110699:19"/>
great Goodneſs for, and care of Infants, and others too, from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as from <hi>Abraham</hi> till Chriſt's time. And yet the Doctor knows there was no outward ſign appointed for initiating Infants, as the Doctor ſpeaks: and wherein does it appear that God was more gracious to Infants by or through Circumciſion, than he was to the Infants of the other Patriarchs? The Fathers tell us (as quoted by learned Proteſtants) <hi>that Circumciſion did not profit the Soul of the Infant; nihil animae Circumciſionem illum profuiſſe.</hi> Chryſoſt. Hom. 39. in <hi>Gen.</hi> And yet the Wiſdom of God was great in appointing Circumciſion ſo early (ſeeing it muſt be the Mark to diſtinguiſh the Family of which Chriſt ſhould be born, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) for the pain was more eaſy to be born in Infancy, than when they attained to Manhood.</p>
            <p>Neither is it by any means to be ſuppoſed, that God by giving this Ceremony to <hi>Abraham,</hi> &amp;c. did neglect all the Infants in the World, as to the Buſineſs of Salvation (which I muſt mention, becauſe the Doctor ever and anon is dropping ſuch Paſſages as may deceive his Reader with ſuch Apprehenſions, though I am ſure the Doctor does believe no ſuch thing.) He was ſtill the God of the Spirits of all Fleſh, and all Infants were ſtill his Offspring; and never rebelling againſt him, his gracious Nature would not ſuffer them to periſh without Remedy, and Remedy they could have none by Circumciſion; for it was not appointed for them. And indeed to conceit our ſelves, that our wiſe and good God ſhould make either Circumciſion or Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm (or any other Ritual) neceſſary to the Salvation of poor dying Infants, is a poor low conceit of God, and contrary to all Rules which he has given to Men to extend Mercy or Juſtice. For ſeeing it is not poſſible for them to have the one or the other, but at the Will of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> others, God's ways are ſo<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> equal that he will never puniſh them for want of either: but the Truth is he required the firſt but of a few in compariſon, and the latter not ſo much as of one Infant: whence then is there ſuch a quoil about Infant-Baptiſm?</p>
            <p>One great Pretence of the Doctor for Infant-Baptiſm, <hi>is taken from the ends of Baptiſm, ſome of which he will have Infants to be capable of, and therefore to be baptized.</hi> This is the ſum of what he ſays in a multitude of Words in ſeveral Pages. But upon a right Diſcovery of the ends of Baptiſm, as they are really ſuch, his <hi>Antecedent</hi> will vaniſh.</p>
            <p>The Ends of Baptiſm (be they what they will) are to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in ſuch a ſenſe, as that ordinarily without Baptiſm ſuch things cannot be obtained. And of theſe ends, Remiſſion of Sins, and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:110699:20"/>
Eternal Life are the principal, <hi>Acts 2. 38. Mark</hi> 16. 16. Now where ever, or upon whomſoever God calls for Obedience in Holy Baptiſm, as the way in which theſe Ends are by them to be obtained, there the Duty of Baptiſm being refuſed, theſe Ends are loſt; as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in the Caſe of the Phariſees and Lawyers, <hi>Luke 7. 29. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Counſel of God againſt themſelves, being not baptized.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I deny that Remiſſion of Sins, and Eternal Life, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to, or in the Caſe of Infants, <hi>as the Ends of Baptiſm.</hi> They have Remiſſion (ſo far as they need it) and Eternal Life, upon other Terms, even the free Mercy of God in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 18. And the good will of God towards them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. 14. And if Infants are uncapable of theſe, <hi>as they are the Ends of Baptiſm,</hi> ſo they will be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of all other Things which are annexed to Baptiſm, <hi>as the Ends of that Ordinance.</hi> As we will propoſe two, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>waſhing of Regeneration,</hi> and <hi>incorporating into Chriſt;</hi> Infants are capable of nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe, <hi>as they are the Ends of Baptiſm.</hi> For, Baptiſm is but demonſtrative, or a ſign of the New Birth; becauſe God will have thoſe that come to be baptized, therein to teſtify, that they have, and therein ſymbolically do <hi>put off the Body of the Sins of the Fleſh,</hi> which Work had its Effect from the Word and Spirit of God. And, 2. to be incorporated with Chriſt, <hi>as it is an End of Baptiſm,</hi> does neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſuppoſe, a being taken out of the Tree that is wild by Nature, or out of our degenerate Eſtate, and planted contrary to that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, by a willing reſignation of Soul and Body to Chriſt, in that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn miniſtration of Baptiſm. And how incapable Infants are of this, all Men muſt needs ſee. To be ſhort, if it could be proved by the Word of God, or found true by Experience, that Infants are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of any Good; or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that the Will of God was wrought by bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizing them, I could yield to the Doctor: but the Truth is, they are capable of none of the Ends of Baptiſm, <hi>as God hath annexed them to Baptiſm,</hi> and therefore his Argument muſt come to nothing. And how eaſy were it to turn this Argument againſt him in the Caſe of the Lord's Supper, but that may be more ſitting in another place.</p>
            <p>But the Doctor ſays, <hi>p. 28. That Infants are capable of all the Ends of Baptiſm, as Baptiſm is inſtituted for a Sign from God towards us, to aſſure us of his gracious Favour, and to conſign unto us the Benefits of the Covenant of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if this Doctrine be true, then either Baptiſm is a ſure Sign of all theſe Things to all Infants, or to ſome few of them only: The former the Doctor will not allow; and yet he cannot but know,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:110699:20"/>
when Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Teach all Nations, baptizing them,</hi> he makes no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between one Perſon and another, all are equally to be taught, and baptized equally upon the ſame Terms. And if the Doctor will have ſome Infants only to have an <hi>Intereſt in the Benefits of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace,</hi> and therefore but ſome only have right to Baptiſm, which conſigns the Covenant of Grace, we ſhall deſire him to prove this well, and therewithal to let as know how he knows one ſort of theſe Infants from another. He ſays, indeed, <hi>That Infants may be Members of a Church</hi> (their Childhood notwithſtanding) <hi>as well as of a Family,</hi> &amp;c. But to be of a Family, is equally natural to all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants; ſo that if this Argument prove any thing, it proves all Infants Church-Members as much as any. <hi>Nor,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>does Childhood hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or incapacitate them for being adopted the Children of God, more than the Children of any other Perſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But God is not like Man to adopt (or receive into favour) ſome poor Infants, and let all the reſt periſh without favour: We affirm, that God has in Mercy taken care of all Infants, (as we have proved): But this does not teach us to do that to ſome of them which he never commanded, and to reject the reſt, as if God had no Mercy for them. Theſe Notions are ſo partial, and ſo uncertain, that no ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Comfort can be taken from them. And <hi>let my Infant,</hi> (whom I confeſs I have not baptized, but only devoted him to God's Mercy and Protection by Prayer) and <hi>the Doctor's Infant</hi> (whom he has croſſed and ſprinkled) be laid together, I am perſwaded the Doctor would tremble to ſay, this Infant is an adopted Child of God, and in his Favour; that Infant is rejected, and out of God's Favour: And truly I cannot but think ſuch Diſcourſes as theſe, proceed not from the bottom of the Heart, but Men pleaſe themſelves to dream waking, of I know not what Favour Almighty God has for their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, above what he has for others.</p>
            <p>The Doctor's next way is to make uſe of Similitudes, as thus; <hi>Should a Prince adopt a Beggar's Child, and incorporate him into the Royal Family, and ſettle a part of his Dominions upon him; and to ſolemnize and confirm all this, ſhould cut off a bit of his Fleſh, or command him to be waſhed with Water; who would count this an inſignificant Ceremony, or Solemnity? or ſay, that the Child was not capable of the Sign, when he was capable of the chief thing ſignified thereby?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Surely ſuch <hi>flouriſhes</hi> as this, may ſoon deceive thoſe that reſt upon them. For, 1. here is no qualification in this Child, nor any requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of it in this caſe; but every Beggar's Child is as capable of this
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:110699:21"/>
Favour as this Child: and conſequently this makes no more for the Infant of an Engliſh Man, than of an Indian; God may be as kind to the one as to the other. 2. Here's the King's Act of Grace pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to this Child, and to no other. 3. Here's the King's expreſs Command, to cut off a bit of the Child's Fleſh, or to waſh it with Water. And thus the whole of the Matter is begg'd; but not any proof for Infant Baptiſm miniſtred from hence; for we grant, that the Things here ſuppoſed to be done, do ſufficiently capacitate the Beggar's Child for the Mercy and Favour of the Prince; but then it as much incapacitates other Children, to whom the King has extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no ſuch pity, and concerning whom he has given no ſuch order; for ſhould the Doctor now, without any Order from the King, fetch all the Beggars Children in the City and Country, and paſs all theſe Solemnities upon them, that they all may be received into the Royal Family, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſuppoſe he would have but little thanks for his labour: even ſo to <hi>croſs, ſprinkle,</hi> or <hi>dip</hi> all the Infants in the World, [and either all or none have right to it] and to adopt them thus to be of the Family of Heaven, without Heaven's Authority to make them capable of it, and God's Direction in the Buſineſs of the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, will not pleaſe God. We therefore content our ſelves to commit our Infants to his Mercy and Protection, in the way of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Prayer for his Bleſſing; and for this we have his own Son, our Lord, to go before us, who thus does ſuffer little Children to come unto him, without rejecting ſo much as one of them.</p>
            <p>The Doctor's next Similitude proceeds thus; <hi>Suppoſe a Prince ſhould ſend for an attainted Traitor's Child, and ſay—You know the Blood of this Child is attainted by his Father's Treaſon; by Law he has forfeited all right to his Father's Eſtate—My Bowels of Compaſſion yearn upon him, and here I reſtore him—and before you all waſh him with pure Water, to ſignify that he is cleanſed—and reſtored to his Birth-right—Could any Man ſay that the Action was inſignificant, becauſe the Child knew no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in this Similitude, the Doctor begs almoſt every thing in queſtion between us. As, 1. That all that are attainted with Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Sin, muſt be waſhed with Water, as a ſign that they are clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from it. 2. That God vouchſafes the Bowels of Compaſſion to ſuch Infants only as he intends ſhall be baptized. 3. That he does not require the Party baptized to underſtand or take notice of any thing, but bids the by-ſtanders take notice of theſe Things. And, 4. this Similitude ſuppoſes, that all Rules about Infant Baptiſm are plainly
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:110699:21"/>
delivered by our Heavenly King, when not one of theſe things are true. But the Doctor does very ill to ſuppoſe that to be a true Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Sacrament, which wants <hi>the inward and ſpiritual Grace;</hi> as in this Similitude there is no knowledg or conſent on the part of him that is baptized, but a meer force is put upon him. And yet when the Doctor can ſhew us what Infants in particular the Bowels of God does yearn towards, and his Will that they be cleanſed by waſhing with Water, that ſhall ſuffice to make them capable of Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>But before we leave this Similitude, let us conſider whether the Foundation of it be ſound. Are Infants indeed ſuch attainted Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons? Sure no; for whatſoever was their Caſe conſidered in ſinful <hi>Adam,</hi> yet when through Chriſt <hi>Adam</hi> was redeemed (that is, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the Promiſe of a Saviour, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15.) all Infants<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who then were all in him, had the Attainder taken off, as much as from <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf, <hi>John</hi> 1. 29. So that this Attainder of Treaſon againſt Infants, as they proceed from <hi>Adam,</hi> is but a Fancy; and to think that he has left Original Sin to be waſhed away by Baptiſm, from poor innocent Babes, is another Fancy; and yet theſe were the Grounds on which Infant Baptiſm was built at firſt, and many are yet under the dominion of this Miſtake.</p>
            <p>We conclude then, that through the free Mercy of God in the Gift of Chriſt, the Attainder of Sin which lay againſt Infants to Condemnation, was taken away from the Foundation of the World; and that Baptiſm was not ordained of God to take away Original Sin, but for the Remiſſion of Actual Sins upon Repentance and Faith. Nor does it appear, in all God's Book, that he appointed any <hi>Ritual,</hi> no not Circumciſion it ſelf, to take away Original Sin, and he that ſhall aſſert it, will be intangled in ſo many Difficulties, as he cannot eſcape. For what then took Original Sin from all Males that died before the eighth Day? And what became of all Females and Male Infants throughout the World? Did God leave them all under a Malady, without any Remedy?</p>
            <p>And though the Doctor inſiſts never ſo much upon that Apochry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phal Story of Infant Baptiſm among the Jews, before the coming of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> yet as himſelf yields, <hi>p. 18. it was not of Divine Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> ſo it is looked upon to be a Fable by the Learned of his own Church, who tell us, as we have ſhewed, That <hi>Rabbi Eliezer denies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there was any ſuch Baptiſm among the Jews,</hi> though <hi>Rabbi Joſhua does affirm it.</hi> To whom ſhall I give credit, (ſaith that Learned Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant) to <hi>Eliezer, who aſſerted what the Scripture confirms,</hi> [that there
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:110699:22"/>
was no ſuch Baptiſm among the Jews] <hi>or to</hi> Joſhua, <hi>who affirms what is no where to be found in Scripture?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not concerned in their anſwer, <hi>who do prove Infants more capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Circumciſion than of Baptiſm, becauſe it left a Character in their Fleſh.</hi> But I anſwer, whatſoever makes any Perſon capable of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, the revealed Will of God to order it ſo is the chief; us for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, ſome Infants might be as capable of Circumciſion on the <hi>7th</hi> day, as others on the <hi>8th,</hi> yet thoſe of 7 days were not at all capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of Circumciſion. So that for Men to inſiſt upon their Conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures, about Infants Capacity or Incapacity, is but to wander in the Dark. It muſt be the Inſtitution of Baptiſm, the Commiſſion for the uſe of it in all Nations, and the Example of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and Churches by them conſtituted, that muſt decide this Queſtion, <hi>Whether Infants are capable of Baptiſm?</hi>
            </p>
         </div>
         <div n="4" type="chapter">
            <head>
               <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Anſwereth the Doctor's ſecond Queſtion; <hi>Whether In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants are excluded from Baptiſm?</hi>
            </head>
            <p>AND here in the firſt place (ſaith the Doctor) I muſt obſerve that the Queſtion ought to be propoſed in theſe Terms, and not <hi>whether Chriſt hath commanded Infants to be baptized? For as a good, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor obſerves of the River</hi> Nile<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>we ought not to ask the Reaſon why</hi> Nile <hi>overflows ſo many days about the Summer Solſtice? But why it doth not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow all the Year long?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But by his Favour he is as wife a Man that asks the firſt Queſtion, as he that asks the ſecond. And I know but one Anſwer to be given to both, and that is chiefly and before all things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> It is the Will of God to order it ſo. Now let this be apply'd to the caſe in hand; And the Will of God ſhall determine, who are, and who are not to be baptized<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>And let the Doctor here reſolve me, whether God excluded Infants of 6 or 7 days old from Circumciſion, when yet there is no negative Law, <hi>you ſhall not circumciſe them;</hi> and he will ſoon anſwer his own Queſtion: For his Anſwer muſt be, ſeeing God did not appoint In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of 7 days old to be circumciſed, therefore he did not admit
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:110699:22"/>
them to it; and our Anſwer is the ſame, Chriſt did not command to baptize Infants, therefore he does not admit them to it. And it is obſerved by ſome learned Men, that tho Negative Commands do uſually exclude, yet it is alſo true that an Inſtitution of God, and an affirmative Command does exclude all that is above or beſides that Command and Inſtitution. And they bring <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 1, 2, to juſtify what they ſay: For <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu</hi> came to a diſmal end. And ſaith <hi>Diodate, Though the Command was not given before, yet it was a Sin, in undertaking the contrary before God's mind was known.</hi> And ſo may the Doctor find the ſame Acceptance, in going where he has no Law to direct him, though there were no negative to forbid him; however we dare not follow him becauſe we fear the Lord, who if <hi>we add to his Word, will reprove both him and us,</hi> Prov. 30. 6.</p>
            <p>But here again the Doctor would build his Infant-Baptiſm upon that Jewiſh Tradition of baptizing the Infants of Proſelytes, though he knows they had no Authority from Heaven for it. And we have ſhewed from a learned Author in chap. 2. that it's very probable there was no ſuch thing. And it's very ſtrange that the Doctor or others ſhould ſuffer themſelves to be thus deluded from the Simplicity of the Goſpel by the Jews <hi>Talmud,</hi> which the Learned <hi>Buxtorf</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plodes with ſuch Indignation; <hi>Whence</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was the Talmud ſent to us, that from thence we ſhould think that the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>either can or ought to be underſtood, much leſs the Goſpel, which they were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Enemies unto?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet now this is become one of the chief Refuges of this Doctor, and of Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> before him, for the Support of Infant-Baptiſm. And it's ſtrange that the Doctor ſhould hope by ſuch Arguments to bring any Credit to the cauſe of Infant Baptiſm. He might as well have referred us to the Turkiſh <hi>Alcoran,</hi> where divers Waſhings are alſo mentioned.</p>
            <p>Page 32, 33. Upon this tottering Foundation the Doctor builds di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Suppoſitions; as firſt, <hi>That if Chriſt had not changed the Seal of the Covenant, but had ſaid, Go make all Nations my Diſciples, circumciſing them; I appeal</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to any impartial Mans Judgment, whether the Apoſtles would not have preſumed, that it was Chriſts Intention that the Infants of adult Proſelites ſhould be circumciſed? And in a Word</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>there lay no Obligation upon our Bleſſed Lord to lay aſide the Practice of Infant Baptiſm, as being inconſiſtent either with the free or manly, or uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Nature of the Chriſtian Church.</hi> I anſwer,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:110699:23"/>1. The caſe which the Doctor puts is not at all rational, but upon this Preſuppoſition that the Diſciples had known the Law before given to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and their Practice in that caſe: but they knew no ſuch Law to have been given to any Nation in the caſe of Baptiſm, ſo that they muſt only keep to the Words of their Commiſſion, and the Practice of their Maſter, who made and baptized Diſciples, and none elſe, <hi>John</hi> 4. 1.</p>
            <p>2. I muſt needs tell the Doctor that Chriſt was obliged to diſapprove and make void the Cuſtom of the Jews in baptizing Infants, (if they did ſo) ſeeing it was but their own Tradition; and that from the Tenor of his own Doctrine, <hi>Matth. 15. 9. Mark 7. In vain do ye worſhip me; teaching for Doctrine the Commandments of Men.</hi> For it was their divers Traditional Waſhings which he was here oppoſing. And ſeeing the Doctor grants their Infant Baptiſm was but a humane In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Phariſees might have replied to our Saviour, Why doſt thou reprove our Waſhings? Doſt not thou alſo allow the Doctrine of Men in the caſe of Infant-Baptiſm? Teacheſt thou another, and teacheſt not thy ſelf? And now the Doctor's Suppoſitions will tumble down of themſelves; for ſeeing the Apoſtles knew no ſuch Practice, as baptizing Infants by God's Appointment in the Jewiſh Church, and they having heard their Maſter condemn all Waſhings in Religion founded only on humane Authority, as being but vain Worſhip; and now receiving no Commandment (as the Doctor muſt alſo confeſs) to baptize Infants, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 20. they were ſufficiently forbidden to baptize any Infants by Chriſt's ſevere Cenſure againſt the Jews for worſhipping God after their own Tradition.</p>
            <p>And therefore though the Doctor thinks he has given ſome reaſon why he ſtated the Queſtion, as you have heard, yet I humbly tell him he was therein very unreaſonable, in that he would beg the whole Controverſy, <hi>whilſt he will ſuppoſe, nay conclude, that Infant-Baptiſm had been the immemorial Practice of the Jewiſh Church, and approved, or not cenſured by our Saviour.</hi> And then indeed if this were true, his Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions might beguile a wiſer Man than I am: But all this being meer ſophiſtical, beggarly and preſumptuous Inſinuations, it is to me a great Evidence againſt Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>But now the Doctor (<hi>p.</hi> 34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 35.) will ſhew that <hi>Matth. 28. 19. Mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 16. 16. Heb. 6. 1, 2. does not ſo much as conſequentially prohibit Infant-Baptiſm.</hi> And becauſe we think theſe places do evidently ſhew that Chriſt in the two firſt could not impoſe any ſuch thing upon his Apoſtles, as to teach Infants, and ſo not to baptize them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all that he commands them to baptize, he commands them firſt
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:110699:23"/>
to teach, or preach the Goſpel to them. And <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 2. ſhews ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry plainly that Baptiſm does not go before, but follows Repentance and Faith, and therefore cannot with any ſhew of Truth or Reaſon from hence belong to Infants, but the contrary. I fay, becauſe we thus think and teach from theſe Scriptures, the Doctor ſays, we <hi>are grievouſly miſtaken, becauſe theſe and the like Texts do of themſelves no more prove that grown Perſons are the only Subjects of Baptiſm, than the Words of the Apoſtle,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 3. 10. <hi>proves that grown Perſons only are to eat. From whence in their ſophiſtical way it may be argued thus, It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs only to grown Perſons to eat, becauſe the Apoſtle requires that Perſons who eat ſhould firſt work.</hi> But I reply;</p>
            <p>The Doctor does here greatly wrong both the Apoſtle and us: 1. The Apoſtle does not ſay, <hi>Any that does not work ſhall not eat,</hi> for he knew that grown Perſons who are ſick and weak as well as Infants, cannot work. But he ſays, <hi>If any would not work,</hi> theſe only are they <hi>who ſhall not eat,</hi> i. e. ſuch as are able, and yet being idle, would not work. Is this fair for the Doctor to pervert the Words of the Text? 2. He abuſes us, for we do not baptize any grown Perſons meerly as ſuch. No, all that we baptize are (or at leaſt profeſs to be) new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Babes in Chriſt. Now our Saviour deſigning Baptiſm to be the Laver of Regeneration, muſt needs prohibit thoſe of whoſe Regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration no Judgment can be made, nor Demonſtration given by any Man whatſoever<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Surely the Doctor has little reaſon to talk of his diſcovering the fallaciouſneſs of our Arguing. But he ſays, he will further ſhew the Weakneſs and Fallacy of our Argument: Let us hear him do that.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Suppoſe</hi> (ſaith the Doctor) <hi>there were a great Plague in any Country, and God ſhould miraculouſly call an eleven or twelve Men, and communicate to them a certain Medicine againſt this Plague; and ſay unto them, Go in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſuch a Country, and call the People together, and teach them the Virtues of this Medicine, and aſſure them, that he that believeth and taketh it from you, ſhall live; but he that believeth not, ſhall die. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I demand of theſe Diſſenters, if the words of ſuch Commiſſion would be ſufficient—to conclude that it was God's intention that they ſhould adminiſter his revealed Medicine to none but grown Perſons, becauſe they only could be called together, and taught the Virtues of it, and believe or disbelieve them that brought it. No certainly this way of arguing would not be admitted by any rational Man,</hi> &amp;c. I anſwer;</p>
            <p>This Similitude is very fallacious and deceitful, ſuppoſing what is not to be ſuppoſed in our Caſe, no, I think not in the Doctor's own
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:110699:24"/>
Judgment. For 1ſt. no Infant is under the Diſeaſe or Plague here meant or intended by the Similitude. For ſeeing Chriſt has taken off their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Pollution, they are juſt Perſons that need no Repentance, they are to be diſtinguiſhed from Infidels, Whoremongers, Drunkards, Swea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Idolaters, ſuperſtitious and erroneous Worſhippers. The Plague of Unbelief cannot ſeize them, therefore the Medicine of Faith is not applied to them. The Diſeaſe of tranſgreſſing the Laws is not upon them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 15. therefore they have not the Medicine of Repentance appointed to them, and conſequently not the Baptiſm of Repentance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Similitude ſuppoſes Infants cannot be cured of the Diſeaſe they are under without Baptiſm, which is ſo contrary to Truth and to Proteſtant Doctrine, that it is to be exploded. And thus we ſee this Flouriſh, about which he ſpends two or three Pages, to the amuſing his credulous Admirers, comes to nothing at all. For no ſooner is it looked into, but it vaniſheth as a Dream when one awaketh. Even ſo, Lord, ſhalt thou deſpiſe this falſe Image of the Goſpel, and all that are like unto it.</p>
            <p>And like unto this is the next following, <hi>p.</hi> 36. For tho it be true that conſidering the previous Law of Circumciſion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17. it is not to be doubted but that <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Solomon</hi> would both obſerve it in any Commiſſion which they might give to propagate it. But what is all this to the purpoſe? Where is the previous Law that commanded In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants to be baptized? And ſuch a Law as muſt be ſuppoſed according to the Similitude, to oblige our <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon,</hi> even Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to obſerve it? Where (I ſay) is this Law to be found? Not in the Word of God, the Doctor confeſſes that: Where then? why in the <hi>Talmud,</hi> the <hi>Gemara, &amp;c.</hi> Very well. But then this wretched <hi>Talmud</hi> was not finiſhed in our Saviour's days, but 500 years after, and ſo could be no Rule to him: nor in the time of his Apoſtles, and ſo could be no Rule to them, and therefore I hope it ſhall never be a Rule to us.</p>
            <p>The Doctor, <hi>p.</hi> 38. ſays, we put the greateſt ſtreſs upon <hi>Mark 16. 16. But it is plain</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that the believing and not believing in that Text, is only to be underſtood of ſuch as are capable of hearing and believing the Goſpel.</hi> Now as this is very true, and therefore Infants may and ſhall be ſaved without believing; ſo it is as true alſo, that Infants are not concern'd in the Duty of Baptiſm here mentioned, but may and ſhall be ſaved without that alſo.</p>
            <p>And as the Doctor tells us, he has proceeded thus far to ſhew how inconcluſively and abſurdly we argue, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo I have proceeded thus
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:110699:24"/>
far too, to ſhew how little Truth or Reaſon he has uſed to convict our Arguments of Weakneſs. But he adds, <hi>So weak are all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Anabaptiſts, by which they endeavour from Scripture to prove that Chriſt hath limited the Subjects of Baptiſm to grown Perſons,</hi> &amp;c. Even ſo I reply, that our weak Arguments are too ſtrong to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by ſuch impertinent Similitudes as the Doctor has brought againſt them. And for Scripture, as he has none, ſo he has brought none, but 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3. 10. which he has alſo very much perverted, as he doth alſo the Arguments uſed by us.</p>
            <p>Here the Doctor (<hi>p.</hi> 39, 40.) is pleaſed to ſay, <hi>That Infant Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is ſo univerſal and ancient a Practice, that no body knows when and where it began; or how not being, it came to be the Practice of the Church, ſince there was never any Church Ancient or Modern, which did not practiſe it, it muſt argue a ſtrange Partiality to think that it could be any leſs than an Apoſtolical Practice and Tradition.</hi> And he brings <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaying, <hi>Had the Churches erred, they would have varied, but what is one and the ſame amongſt them all, proceeds not from Error, but Tradition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here the Doctor has left his Jewiſh Fort, and takes Sanctuary in Apoſtolical Tradition; and indeed, the wiſeſt Man that aſſerts this Scriptureleſs Practice, is at a loſs where to fix it. Nay, the Doctor now tells us plainly, <hi>That no Body knows when, and how, and where In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm came in.</hi> And we tell him as plainly, that this is a ſign that it is an Error, and <hi>came in privily,</hi> ſtealing by degrees upon the Churches, as falſe Teachers are ſaid to do, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 4. But now if the Doctor will ſtand to <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Rule, we ſhall ſoon prove that Infant-Baptiſm is an Error. For,</p>
            <p>1. All Churches have not held or practiſed it; no, not ſo much as one Church mentioned in the Holy Scripture, or during the Apoſtles Days. The Mother Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> knew no ſuch practice, for <hi>non apparen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus,</hi> &amp;c. that which appears not, is not. It's eaſy for the Doctor to ſay, all Churches held it, but it's impoſſible for him to prove it. He confeſſes, no Body knows when it came in, nor how, nor where; and why then might there not be true Churches before it came in, even in his own Judgment, and then all Churches have not held it.</p>
            <p>2. But now this is our Argument from <hi>Tertul. If the Churches va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about Infant Baptiſm, then they erred in it: But they varied about it,</hi> ergo <hi>they erred in it.</hi> The <hi>Major</hi> the Doctor muſt not deny, becauſe it's become his own; The <hi>Minor</hi> I ſhall prove preſently; firſt, in <hi>Tertullian</hi> himſelf, for he was not always the ſame, even as he is quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Doctor, <hi>p.</hi> 41. for firſt he brings him in ſaying, <hi>Pro cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſ<expan>
                     <am>
                        <g ref="char:abque"/>

               <hi>perſonae conditione, ac diſpoſitione, etiam aetate cunctatio Baptiſmo utilior eſt, praecipue tamen circa parvulos,</hi> &amp;c. It ſeems then, that tho he ſpeaks favourably of it afterwards; yet he thought <hi>the delay of Baptiſm,</hi> ESPECIALLY FOR LITTLE CHILDREN, <hi>to be more profitable.</hi> And this alſo was the Opinion of <hi>Nazianzen:</hi> Theſe two great Men, who are (at leaſt the firſt of them) as early Witneſſes of Infant-Baptiſm creeping into the Church, as can juſtly be named, ſhewing ſo much doubfulneſs about baptizing Infants, is a great ſign it had no Authority from Chriſt and his Apoſtles; for what were theſe Men to teach to delay it, if Chriſt had commanded it? And yet ſo they did expreſly teach, as the words quoted out of <hi>Tertullian</hi> by the Doctor do farther ſhew, becauſe it was his preſent Opinion, That, <hi>cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tatio Baptiſmi praecipue circa parvulos</hi> was <hi>utilior.</hi> He anſwers, <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient dum adoleſcunt, venient dum diſcunt, dum quo veniant docentur.</hi> Yea, he further ſaith, <hi>Fiant Chriſtiani quum Chriſtum noſſe potuerint;</hi> but this the Doctor left out. And if after this he altered his Judgment, as the Doctor ſuppoſes, (though ſome Learned Men think otherwiſe) it ſhews, that he was contrary to himſelf in this thing.</p>
            <p>Now that whole Churches varied about it, whether we reſpect the Infant Subject, or the alteration of Dipping to Sprinkling, has been abundantly made evident by many; ſo that I ſhall content my ſelf with an Inſtance or two out of the Learned <hi>Du-Veil,</hi> who from <hi>Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> on <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 13. gives this account: <hi>That according to the Rule of Scripture, and agreeing with Reaſon it ſelf, the moſt part of the Greeks in all Ages, even unto this Day, retain a Cuſtom of delaying Infant Baptiſm, till they themſelves can give a Confeſſion of their Faith.</hi> He alſo brings <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> in his <hi>40th</hi> Oration, treating of thoſe to whom Baptiſm was not adminiſtred BY REASON OF INFANCY. And it is certain, that <hi>Nazianzen</hi> himſelf, though the Son of a Chriſtian Biſhop, about the <hi>4th</hi> Century, and bred up in the Chriſtian Religion, was not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized till he was about thirty Years of Age. The ſame is alſo true of <hi>Chryſoſtom, Hierom, Ambroſe, Auſtin,</hi> and others. And hence (ſaith he) it does manifeſtly appear, That <hi>the wiſeſt of our Fathers in Chriſt did not come to Baptiſm, until they were come to a ſtrong and confirmed Age and Wit.</hi> Note here, the wiſeſt of our Fathers were not baptized in Infancy; you may be ſure then, that the Churches did vary about it. I could never read of ſo much as one of the Ancient Fathers, for ſix hundred Years after Chriſt, that was baptized in his Infancy.</p>
            <p>The Learned <hi>Curcelaeus,</hi> as quoted by <hi>Du-Veil,</hi> affirms, <q>That the Cuſtom of baptizing Infants, was brought in without the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:110699:25"/>
of Chriſt, and did not begin before the Third Age. And the Cuſtom of it being brought in, was much more frequent in <hi>Africa</hi> than in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and with far greater opinion of Neceſſity. This muſt needs ſatisfy, that the Churches did vary about Infant-Baptiſm at its firſt creeping into the Church.</q> And how Chriſtians have varied one from another becauſe of it, is apparent in all Ages and Nations almoſt ever ſince it had a being, has been very largely evidenced, by the care and induſtry of Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> and others: And, I think, this preſent Age may ſpeak for it ſelf, that there are very many Chriſtians, and Churches too, who vary about this Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Therefore after the Doctor's Rule from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> they have, and do err in this Matter on the one hand, or on the other.</p>
            <p>As the Alteration of the Subject, ſo the Alteration of the manner of the Adminiſtration, has cauſed great diſcord among Chriſtians. How Offenſive it was to uſe Sprinkling (which it ſhould ſeem ſome were labouring to introduce) in the Year 816, may be gathered from the Synod of <hi>Celicyth,</hi> who gave ſtrict Order to Dip, and not to Sprinkle; <hi>Let the Presbyters beware, that when they Adminiſter the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of Baptiſm, they do not pour Water upon the Heads of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, but let them be always plunged in the Font, according to the Example of the Son of God.</hi> But directly contrary hereunto, our Engliſh Synod, in their Rubrick, do order the Presbyters to Sprinkle, in caſe the Child be weak; and ever ſince they were all weak that were brought to be Baptized, for they do nothing but Sprinkle. And ſo pernicious is this Alteration, that the Muſcovites, and others, do now deny the Latins, and other Weſtern Countries, to be rightly Baptized, becauſe they have changed the manner from Dipping to Sprink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling.</p>
            <p>I might enlarge my Teſtimonies of this kind out of the Learned <hi>Du-Veil</hi> and others. And yet the Doctor would perſwade the World, the Churches have not varied about this Matter. Nor need the Doctor <hi>wonder that none of the Writers in the firſt Age of Chriſtianity, are found to detect the baptizing of Infants,</hi> ſeeing there are none that yet appear in that Age to have held any ſuch Thing. And Dr. <hi>Barlow</hi> has given Teſtimony, That <hi>there is no juſt Evidence of Infant-Baptiſm till a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout two hundred Years after Chriſt.</hi> The Diſſenters therefore are not unreaſonable (as the Doctor would have them) in charging thoſe that have altered, or that approve the Alterations thus made in the Caſe of Sacred Baptiſm, with Apoſtacy, or falling from the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, at leaſt in this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that they have now no true Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:110699:26"/>I freely grant, (ſaith the Doctor) <hi>That no Arguments are equal to the Scriptures, when the Interpretations of them are not doubtful.</hi> And certainly the Texts which concerns the Subject and manner of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, are none of the Scriptures whoſe Interpretations are doubtful, becauſe it did not comport with the Wiſdom of Chriſt that they ſhould be ſo. Certainly the Rule which God gave about Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was plain enough; And ſhall we think our Saviour did leave us to Ambiguities to guide us, in admitting his People to Church-Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges? What then can we ſuppoſe to be plain? This very thing then that the Paedobaptiſts are conſtrain'd to confeſs, (as Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> and others) that it's a very difficult thing to prove Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and that (as the Doctor here) the Scriptures which are brought for it are not plain, for if they were, he confeſſes no Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are like them; but being not clear for Infant-Baptiſm, tho as clear as the Sun for Believers Baptiſm, therefore he flies to the <hi>harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious practice of the Ancient Churches, and the undivided conſent of the Apoſtolical Fathers as authentical Interpreters,</hi> &amp;c. But theſe are mere flouriſhes, there has been no ſuch Harmony, nor ſuch undivided<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs among Churches and Fathers in this Matter, as we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>He brings many Paſſages out of Authors Ancient and Modern; but theſe, eſpecially the moſt Ancient of them, have been ſo effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſcan'd by many Learned Pens of thoſe of our Way, as <hi>Tombs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Fiſher, Blackwood, Danvers, Den, Du-Veil,</hi> and others, that it's needleſs to do more. I ſhall rather endeavour to quiet the Clamour about Fathers, Ancient Churches, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as if all muſt be determined by their Sentences, by preſenting the Reader with that grave Speech of <hi>Lactantius,</hi> one of theſe Fathers themſelves, by which it will appear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that this Clamour is unreaſonable. Thus he ſpeaks, <hi>Lib. 2. c.</hi> 8. Div. Inſtit. <hi>Dedit omnibus Deus pro virili portione ſapientiam,</hi> &amp;c. <q>God hath given Wiſdom unto all Men, according to a competent meaſure, that they may both find out Things unheard of before, and weigh Things already found out. Neither becauſe they had the ſtart of us in Time, doth it likewiſe follow that they have it alſo in Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; which if it be indifferently granted to all, it cannot be fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled by them which went before. It is unimparable, like the Light and Brightneſs of the Sun, it being the Light of Man's Heart, as the Sun is of the Eyes. Sythence then to be Wiſe, that is, to ſearch the Truth, is a Diſpoſition imbred in every Man, they debar them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of Wiſdom, who, without any examination, approve the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:110699:26"/>
Invention of their Anceſtors. But this is that which deceives them, they, like unreaſonable Creatures, are wholly led by others; the Name of Anceſtors being once ſet in the Front, they think it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, that either themſelves ſhould be wiſer, becauſe they are called <hi>Punies;</hi> or that the other ſhould be in any thing miſtaken, becauſe they are called <hi>Anceſtors.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>So that if the Doctor had quoted more of the Ancients than he has done, yet ſo long as we have the higheſt Authorities, the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the Reaſon of Men, as well as the Ancients, we can only follow them, as we ſee or know they follow Chriſt. And more than this St. <hi>Paul</hi> does not require of us. <hi>The Ancient Fathers</hi> (ſaith the Doctor) <hi>undoubtedly had well read and conſidered the Hiſtory of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in the Acts of the Apoſtles, but never drew ſuch abſurd Conſequences from them,</hi> &amp;c. And did they not as well read the Hiſtory of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion in the Acts of the Apoſtles; and yet drew theſe abſurd Conſequences for 600 Years together, that Infants ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated. But to this the Doctor tells us,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That God might ſuffer all the Church to fall into ſuch a harmleſs Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice as that of Infant-Communion; or that the Fathers of the Church might comply with the Religious Fondneſs of the People, as we do,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in bringing them to Prayers.</hi> Now as this may be well gueſſed, ſo we likewiſe may conjecture, and it's not improbable but Infant-Baptiſm came ſtealing ſo too upon the Churches at the firſt; but after theſe Errors had got root, they were both defended by the Fathers as if they had been Oracles drop'd from Heaven. And ſuch a Neceſſity laid upon them, as if Infants could not be ſaved without them. Thus did <hi>Auguſtine</hi> teach, both concerning Infant-Baptiſm, and Infant-Communion.</p>
            <p>The Doctor demands, <hi>What account can rationally be given why the Jewiſh Chriſtians who were offended at the neglect of Circumciſion, ſhould not have been much more offended, if the Apoſtles had refuſed to initiate Infants under the new Teſtament?</hi> But we may with more reaſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Doctor, ſeeing the Jews were ſo offended at the Neglect of Circumciſion, why did not the Apoſtles quiet this diſcontented People by telling them, you need not be offended, ſeeing inſtead of Infant-Circumciſion you have now Infant-Baptiſm? and if indeed there had been any ſuch thing, it had been the moſt pertinent means to quiet them, to refer them to that for Satisfaction. But ſeeing the Apoſtles make no uſe of this Argument, it's clear they had no ſuch thing to argue from, for where they could uſe it, they did, as in the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:110699:27"/>
caſe of baptized Believers themſelves, <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 2. 11. which is a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Argument that Infant-Baptiſm had no being in the Church in St. <hi>Paul's</hi> time, ſeeing he never mentions it at all, no not then when he had the greateſt occaſion for it that could be given.</p>
            <p>The Doctor obſerves, <hi>that the Jews always looked upon the Children of Pagans as common or unclean; but upon their own as ſeparate and Holy.</hi> And then he tells us, that St. <hi>Paul makes the ſame Diſtinction between them,</hi> 1 Cor. 7. 14. But this is ſo expreſly againſt the Word of God, that I admire the Doctor ſhould write it, was not this Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Jew and Gentile, the one being common and unclean, the other Holy, taken quite away. <hi>Acts 10. 15, 18. What God hath cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, call not thou common:</hi> which the Apoſtle expounds thus, <hi>ver. 28. God hath ſhewed me that I ſhould not call any Man common or unclean.</hi> And why ſhould the Doctor ſo much as think that St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould count the Infants of Jews or Gentiles which do not yet believe, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and unclean:</hi> The Text 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. ſays not a Word to that Purpoſe; but is an Anſwer to the Scruple which ſome Chriſtians had about continuing in Marriage-Union with their Yoke-Fellows, who were Unbelievers, ſuppoſing them to be unclean; but St. <hi>Paul</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwades them to continue in that Relation, for that they were <hi>both ſanctified</hi> to that Relation of Husband and Wife, elſe ſaith he, <hi>your Children were unclean.</hi> Now this Text is greatly abuſed by Poedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, and the learned <hi>Muſcullus,</hi> who had abuſed this Text as they do, at laſt <hi>did confeſs as much.</hi> Now this place <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 15, 18, 28. does ſo fully explain St. <hi>Paul,</hi> that no Man can with any ſhew of Truth or Reaſon make a Diſtinction between a Chriſtian's Infant, and the Infant of an Indian, to call the one common and unclean, the other ſeparate and Holy; for if we may call no Man (as ſuch) com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and unclean, much leſs may we call an Infant ſo. If they be born according to the Law of God, they are called by the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> a Seed of God, <hi>chap. 2. v.</hi> 15.</p>
            <p>And though this Mercy of God towards all Infants equally, might perhaps <hi>gaul the Jews,</hi> as it does the Doctor and his party, yet it's Evangelical Doctrine, and ſhews evidently that God is no Reſpecter of Perſons; and Infants being all equally the ſame, as Objects of his Pity, he deſpiſes none of theſe little ones: The innocent Babes in <hi>Nineveh</hi> were as dear to him, as the innocent Babes in the Land of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael:</hi> and yet for all this it is certain that the Children of faithful Men have many Bleſſings, which the Children of evil Men have not; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Children of many Prayers, and under early Advantages to know
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:110699:27"/>
the Lord, and to cut ſhort the Days of Iniquity: whilſt on the other ſide the Children of Unbelievers are in danger by an evil Education to be kept from the Truth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and brought up in Error, and as ſuch they (as their Fathers for the ſame cauſe) become defiled, not by Birth, but by Sin, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. 15. For as born according to God's Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, they are his Offspring, <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 28. and ſo Holy. And to this agrees the Sentence of <hi>Muſcullus, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſs Marriage were Holy and clean, even between <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers; what other thing would follow, than that all the Children are Baſtards and unclean? But far be it from us to ſay ſo; they are Holy, for they are born of lawful Marriage.</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. V.</hi> Anſwereth the Doctor's third, Queſtion, Whether it be lawful to ſeparate from a Church which appointeth Infants to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized?</head>
            <p>THat the Church or People of God ought to be a People ſeparated from them that live in Wickedneſs, and are profeſſed Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to the Truths of the Goſpel in things eſſential to Church-Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, will not be denied, I ſuppoſe by any Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Now there are two Cauſes, beſides that of the want of true Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, which does warrant the preſent Separation maintained by the preſent baptized Believers, from the Parochial Church-Communion. The firſt is that great Impiety and ungodly living which is every where to be ſeen in ſuch Churches: for the worſt of Men to be ſure will croud into thoſe Churches as their Sanctuaries; let the moſt vigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant Magiſtrates, and the well-minded Perſons in National Churches do what they can, (in their preſent Conſtitution) for there will they be, yea and in places of Preferment too.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The many Innovations and continual Alterations in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, not to be avoided in National Church-Conſtitutions, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Influence of Intereſt, and of the Revolutions which National Government has always upon them, does neceſſarily enforce; at leaſt ſome Diſtinction in Communion, between ſuch Churches, and thoſe whoſe profeſſed Principles are conſtantly to adhere to Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Inſtitutions only, in all things eſſential to the Conſtitution and
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:110699:28"/>
Government of the Church of God; which muſt ever be the ſame, (or ſhould be) however the Government of Nations do alter or ſuffer Revolutions.</p>
            <p>And to this agrees that excellent Sentence of a Divine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in his Sermon before the Court of Aldermen, <hi>Aug. 23. 1674. We have an Obligation to the Laws of God antecedent to thoſe of any Church whatſoever: nor are we bound to obey thoſe, any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than they are agreeable with theſe—Separation from a Church is lawful, 1. When ſhe requires of us, as a Condition of her Communion, an Acknowledgment and Profeſſion of that for a Truth, which we know to be an Error. 2. When ſhe requires of us, as a Condition of her Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the joyning with her in ſome Practices, which we know to be againſt the Law of God. In theſe two caſes, to withdraw our Obedience to the Church, is ſo far from being a Sin, that it is a neceſſary Duty.</hi> Now this being our very caſe in the point of Baptiſm, it would juſtify that Diſtinction which we hold needful, between the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and thoſe of the baptized Believers; but much more when there are ſome other things as preſſing perhaps as this. But now let us hear the Doctor.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Conſidering</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what I have ſaid upon the former Queſtions: this Queſtion muſt be anſwered in the negative, whether we conſider Infant-Baptiſm, as a thing lawful or allowable only, or as a thing highly requiſite and neceſſary to be done.</hi> And as a Foundation on which to build In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm as a thing at leaſt lawful and allowable, he directly denies this Principle, <hi>That nothing is to be appointed in Religious matters, but what is warranted by Precept and Example in the Word of God,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting this Rule <hi>an Abſurdity, and inconſiſtent with the free and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Nature of the Chriſtian. Religion—and that it is an impracticable Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 49, 50.</p>
            <p>But that this great Principle, well underſtood, ſhould be ſpoken againſt by a Proteſtant, is ſomething ſtrange, and eſpecially, that he does not ſuffer it to take place in that which is <hi>eſſential in a Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate,</hi> as <hi>who are</hi> and <hi>who are not to be baptized,</hi> is ſuch a caſe: but he will have Infant-Baptiſm to be admitted, <hi>as lawful and allowable, tho it be not warranted by Precept nor Example.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To free this Principle from Abuſe, as here ſuggeſted againſt it, we will explain it, as we hold and maintain it. 1. Then we do not ſay that every thing, which is naturally or meerly accidental and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial in the Worſhip of God, muſt have Precept and Example in the Word of God. 2. Nor do we hold that things which are meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:110699:28"/>
indifferent (if not impoſed as Boundaries of Communion) are therefore to be eſteemed ſinful, becauſe not expreſly warranted by Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or Example in the Word. 3. But we apply this Rule always, and ſo in our preſent Queſtion, to ſuch things as are eſſential to Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memberſhip, and Church-Government, as true Baptiſm is to the firſt; and cannot be admitted only as a thing indifferent, and as ſuch allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or lawful only; for it's either neceſſary in the Conſtitution of a Church, or it's nothing: and who are of Right, and who are not to be baptized, is of the Eſſence of Baptiſm, and can admit of no lower a Conſideration.</p>
            <p>The Principle thus explained, is clearly juſtified by the Word of God; and if Proteſtants part with this Principle, they will loſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Now thus ſaith the Lord, <hi>Ye ſhall not add to the Word which I command you, neither ſhall you diminiſh ought from it, that you may keep the Commandments of the Lord your God,</hi> Deut. 4. 2. <hi>What thing ſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver I command you, obſerve to do it, thou ſhalt not add thereto, nor dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ought from it,</hi> Deut. 12. 32. <hi>Every Word of God is pure—add thou not unto his Words, leſt he reporve thee, and thou be found a Liar,</hi> Prov. 30. 6. And it is obſervable that our Lord, as he was ſent to be a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of the Goſpel, claims no Authority to ſpeak of himſelf, <hi>John 12. 5. Whatſoever I ſpeak therefore, even as the Father ſaid unto me, ſo I ſpeak.</hi> How ought this to put an awe upon all that ſpeak in the Name of the Lord about Religion? Neither does the holy Spirit it ſelf [as ſent to ſupply the perſonal Abſence of Chriſt] take upon himſelf to give or abrogate Laws, but to bring things to the Apoſtles Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, <hi>John 14. 26. Howbeit when the Spirit of Truth is come, he will guide you into all Truth; FOR he ſhall not ſpeak of himſelf, but whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſhall hear, that ſhall he ſpeak:</hi> And this is the Rule alſo by which the Spirit of Truth is known, namely by his advancing the Things delivered by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, <hi>He ſhall take of mine, and ſhew it unto you, he ſhall glorify me.</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 3, 4. <hi>If any Man teach otherwiſe, and conſent not to wholeſome Words, even the Words of our Lord Jeſus Christ, he is proud, knowing nothing.</hi> 1 John 4. 6. <hi>He that knoweth God, heareth us; he that is not of God, heareth not us: hereby know we the Spirit of Truth, and the Spirit of Error.</hi> Rev. 22. 18. <hi>If any Man ſhall add to theſe things, God ſhall add the Plagues which are written in this Book; and if any ſhall take away from the Words of the Prophecy of this Book, God ſhall take away his Part out of the Book of Life.</hi> And that this Text does eſtabliſh as unalterable the whole New Teſtament our Adverſaries do acknowledg: See <hi>Diodate</hi> on the Place. And <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:110699:29"/>
upon <hi>Deut.</hi> 12. 32: <q>Sith they (ſaith he) cannot deny that this was ſpoken to the Church, what do they elſe but report the Stub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs of the Church, which they boaſt to have been ſo bold as after ſuch Prohibitions, nevertheleſs to add and mingle of her Own with the Doctrine of God. And <hi>Luther</hi> doth aver, that no Doctrine ought to be taught or heard in the Church beſides the pure Word of God. <hi>Beza</hi> upon <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 3. ſpeaking in the Perſon of God, I will puniſh them that ſerve me otherwiſe than I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, not ſparing the chief, that the People may fear and praiſe my Judgments.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Borroughs</hi> in his Goſpel-Worſhip, <hi>p.</hi> 8. <q>All things in God's Worſhip muſt have a Warrant out of God's Word, muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; It is not enough that it is not forbidden, and what hurt is there in it? <hi>but it muſt be commanded.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In a Book called, <hi>A brief Account of the Riſe of the Name</hi> Proteſtant, <hi>p.</hi> 12. printed 1688, we read thus, <q>Proteſtantiſm doth mainly or rather only conſiſt in aſſerting the Holy Scriptures to be the Rule, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Rule, by which all Chriſtians are to govern and manage them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in all Matters of Religion; ſo that no Doctrine is to be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an Article of Faith, on any account, but what hath very plain Warrant and ſound Evidence from the Scriptures: Nor no Inſtance of Religious Worſhip to be owned or ſubmitted to, as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, nor any thing to be determined as a part of Religion, but what the Scriptures do appoint and warrant.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus our Adverſaries themſelves do ſay as much for this Principle which the Doctor condemns <hi>as abſurd,</hi> as we do. And indeed where this Principle is neglected, many Innovations are introduced, and many Truths are neglected, under as fair ſhews of Antiquity as can be pretended for Infant-Baptiſm. The Doctor then had little reaſon to call this <hi>a ſlaviſh Principle,</hi> which is indeed the Principle which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers us from Slavery, to Jewiſh Fables, Mens Inventions and Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pag.</hi> 53, 54. the Doctor, to ſupport Infant-Baptiſm, tells us, how he <hi>builds many Points of Faith and Practice, nor upon certain Evidences of the Scripture, otherwiſe than as interpreted ſo or ſo, by the Catholick Church<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> as 1. <hi>That Chriſt is of one Subſtance with the Father. 2. That there are three Perſons in the Trinity. 3. That it is neceſſary for Chriſtians to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble on the Lord's Day. 4. That the Church be governed by Biſhops. 5. That Women have the Lord's Supper. 6. That Infants are to be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.</hi> And theſe things he makes neceſſary, <hi>no otherwiſe, but as the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick</hi>
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:110699:29"/>
               <hi>Church has interpreted divers Scriptures to juſtify them to be ſo.</hi> Sure this is ſtrange Doctrine for a Proteſtant.</p>
            <p>But were a Man diſpoſed to trace him in all theſe Particulars, it might appear that the Churches in moſt Ages have been divided in all, or the moſt of theſe Points; that ſo that he makes the Catholick Church (as it is commonly taken) ſo great a Foundation of his Faith, as he here pretends to make her, will meet with many Difficulties to diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and take off his Confidence. And particularly if I deſire him to reſolve me but this one, What ſort of Chriſtians are this Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Church? But he adds,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We can prove Infant-Baptiſm from the Scope and Tenor of the Goſpel, and from many Paſſages of it, as they are interpreted according to the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the ancient Primitive Church.</hi> But this is a vain Boaſt, and I demand what Church, or what Apoſtle did interpret any part of the Doctrine of Chriſt, or of the Goſpel to ſuch a ſenſe? The Doctor replies, <hi>It is unreaſonable to preſume that the Goſpel would not extend the Subject of Baptiſm, as far as the Jewiſh Church extended the Subject both of Circumciſion and Baptiſm.</hi> But I anſwer, if this be granted, yet the Doctor gains nothing; for, 1. The Jewiſh Church had no Baptiſm at all of Divine Inſtitution, and therefore could not extend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that ſhe had not. 2. Her Circumciſion was limited to <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Family, and perhaps not extended to much above a third part of that Family nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſeeing all Females, and all Males that died before the eighth Day were debarred of it: Whereas the Goſpel extends holy Baptiſm to all Nations, to the End of the World, to both Male and Female, as they are qualified for it: Thus for his Argument from the Scope. Let us now ſee his particular Paſſages to prove Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>P.</hi> 55. The Doctor gives us theſe Texts (as interpreted by the Catholick Church) for Infant-Baptiſm, <hi>John 3. 5. Mark<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 10. 14. 1 Cor. 1. 16. Acts 16. 15, 33. 1 Cor. 7. 14. 1 Cor.</hi> 10. 2. Good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der look upon theſe Scriptures, and thou wilt not find one word of Precept or Example for Infant-Baptiſm in them all. The firſt Place ſhews that none can be Church-members lawfully under the Goſpel, except they be regenerate, and have the waſhing of Regeneration by Water; but Infant-Regeneration is a Secret, no Man can know it, God will fit them for Heaven if they die in Infancy: this <hi>David</hi> knew, for his Child which was begot in Adultery, and died without Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, yet he nothing doubted its Salvation. The ſecond Text, our Saviour pronounceth unbaptized (yea I ſay, unbaptized)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Infants to belong to Heaven, how unwiſe then was the Doctor to bring it for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm?
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:110699:30"/>
If theſe very Infants which were brought to Chriſt's own Perſon, yet were not by him appointed to be baptized, it can never prove that other Infants are to be baptized. And ſeeing our Saviour declares that unbaptized Infants belong to Heaven, therefore that Place <hi>John</hi> 3. 5. cannot by any means be underſtood of Infants.</p>
            <p>Look well alſo upon 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 16. and compare it with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16. 15, 16. and thou wilt find, tho the Catholick Church ſay nothing, that the Houſhold of <hi>Stephanus</hi> were ſuch as had been converted, and were the firſt Fruits in <hi>Achaia,</hi> and had addicted themſelves to the Work of the Miniſtry, and then theſe could be no Infants.</p>
            <p>As for the two Houſholds, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. it's admirable that wiſe Men ſhould bring them to prove what they do ſufficiently confute. For <hi>Lydia</hi> had no Husband we read of. And there is no Infant found in her Houſe; but the Perſons of her Family received Inſtruction from <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, Acts 16. ult.</hi> therefore no Infants.</p>
            <p>And of the <hi>Jaylor's Houſhold,</hi> it is expreſly ſaid, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpake the Word to all that were in his Houſe; and that he rejoiced, belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in God with all his Houſe. And they went out about Midnight to be baptized. All which being well weighed, no Man, no Church can honeſtly interpret this Text for Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>And for that Place 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 14. the Doctor does injure it, as he did before, in thruſting in the word <hi>common.</hi> And it is ill done to make any diſtinction of <hi>common</hi> and <hi>unclean,</hi> from <hi>holy,</hi> which God has not made, but rather taken away, as we proved from <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 15. No Man (as ſuch) is now to be called common or unclean, and therefore no Infant is to be called common or unclean, but being born according to God's Ordinance, they are (as ſuch) a <hi>holy Seed,</hi> or <hi>a Seed of God.</hi> See the learned <hi>Diodate</hi> upon the Place, <hi>Mal. 2. 14. Marriage ought to be of one with one; and two in the ſame Fleſh. God's chief End in this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding was, that the Poſterity might be ſanctified<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> being born in chaſte Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, according to his Appointment; whereas it is defiled by all manner of unlawful Conjunction.</hi> And to concude, I wiſh that my ſelf, and the Doctor, my Oppoſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> in this caſe, be found at laſt as holy as a dying Infant of a Jew, or poor Indian, and we ſhall be ſure to go to Hea-Heaven; for I could never find that it is the Will of our Heavenly Father, that one of theſe little ones ſhould periſh.</p>
            <p>We come now to his laſt Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. where we find, and the Doctor does ingenuouſly acknowledg, that the Baptiſm here meant was but an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mbrage</hi> or <hi>Shadow</hi> of Baptiſm, not a <hi>real Baptiſm.</hi> Nor does the Text ſpeak of Infants being baptized in this umbratical Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:110699:30"/>
it ſeems as clearly reſtrained to the Fathers in the caſe of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, as the eating and drinking ſpiritually of Chriſt is reſtrained to them, <hi>ver.</hi> 3. So that nothing can be urged from this Text for Infant-Baptiſm, which will not with equal Truth and Reaſon conclude for their coming to the Lord's Table. Read Mr. <hi>Diodate</hi> upon this place, he was for Infant-Baptiſm, yet does not infer Infant-Baptiſm from this Text, as indeed there is no reaſon ſo to do. For it is certain, that all that paſſed through the Sea, were not baptized to <hi>Moſes,</hi> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was a Multitude of Strangers did go with the Iſraelites; and they are diſtinguiſhed from the Children of <hi>Iſrael, Exod. 12. 38. Numb.</hi> 11. 4. But S. <hi>Paul</hi> appropriates Baptiſm in the Cloud and in the Sea, to the Fathers [<hi>all our Fathers, &amp;c.</hi>] Now for any to add. [<hi>and all their Infants</hi>] is a Preſumption not to be juſtified. It is not ſaid, that <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or <hi>all Iſrael</hi> were baptized, which had it been ſo expreſs'd, would have more favoured the Notion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And yet we know that the words [<hi>Iſrael,</hi> and all <hi>Iſrael</hi>] do not include Infants in many places; for example, <hi>Exod. 14. 31. &amp; 15. 1. Deut. 13. 11. Joſh.</hi> 7. 25. much leſs can they be here called Fathers, and ſuch Fathers too, as did feed upon Chriſt in Manna, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as well as were baptized unto <hi>Moſes</hi> in the Cloud, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> It muſt needs be very dangerous to inſiſt upon this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle at the Red Sea, as a Rule to us to baptize Infants; the Cauſe is weak which needs ſuch Arguments to defend it.</p>
            <p>The Doctor ſets down many other Texts in his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin,<note place="margin">Rom. 5. Pſal. 51. 5. Rom. 3. 23, 24. 1 Cor. 1. 15, 21, 22. 2 Cor. 5. 14; 15. Job 14. 4.</note> which I have alſo put down in mine; that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may peruſe them, and ſee if he can find any footing for Infant-Baptiſm in any of them; the moſt likely in the Doctor's own Judgment, is <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. 5. and yet we know, that <hi>David</hi>'s Infant which was born in Adultery, was ſaved without Circumciſion or Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>And the Doctor<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> confeſſes that the Requiſite Neceſſity of Infant-Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm cannot be demonſtrated from theſe Texts, without the Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ancient Church. And there is no ſuch authentick Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be found, (whatever is pretended) for he brings none from the firſt Churches at all. And that there is no ſuch Tradition, Dr. <hi>Jer. Taylor</hi> is a great witneſs, who in his Diſſwaſive from Popery, and in his Rule of Conſcience, informs us, <hi>There is no prime or Apoſtolical Tradition for Infant-Baptiſm. That it was not practiſed till about the</hi> 3d <hi>Century, and judged neceſſary about the</hi> 4th. <hi>That Children of Chriſtian Parents were not baptized till they came to <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding in the firſt Ages. That Dipping, and not Sprinkling, was the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage of Chriſt and his Apoſtles;</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:110699:31"/>
               <hi>and the conſtant Doctrine and Practice of the Ancients for many hundred Years.</hi> See alſo Mr. <hi>Tombes, 3d part of Review.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But after all this the Doctor is pleaſed <hi>to allow Salvation to Infants</hi> which die unbaptized; <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we ought not to tie God to the ſame means to which he hath tied us.</hi> It ſeems then God hath not tied Infants to any Neceſſity of Baptiſm, nor can he prove that he hath tied us to baptize them. But now he will try another way to enforce his Arguments.</p>
            <q>Suppoſe (ſaith he) that Scripture and Tradition ſtood againſt Infant-Baptiſm, in the ſame Poſture as now it ſtands for it, it would not be unjuſtifiable for any ſort of Men to ſeparate from the Church for not baptizing Infants. Let us ſuppoſe that Chriſt had ſaid, I ſuffer not little Children to come to me, for the Kingdom of God is not of ſuch,—and that we had been aſſured by the Writers of the two next Ages to the Apoſtles, that then there was no baptizing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, I appeal unto them whether it would not be highly unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſeparate from all the Churches in the World for not allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Infant-Baptiſm againſt the concurrence of ſuch a Text to the contrary, and the Senſe and Practice of the Catholick Church?</q>
            <p>The meaning of the Doctor I take to be this, that as it is highly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to ſeparate from a Church, who upon a doubtful or proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ground <hi>only,</hi> does give Baptiſm to Children: ſo it would be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unreaſonable to ſeparate from a Church, who upon a like doubtful or probable ground only, ſhould refuſe to baptize Infants. I confeſs this is an odd way of diſputing; for here the Churches ſuppoſed to err on either ſide, are yet ſuppoſed themſelves to be true Churches, and only erring about ſuch a doubtful Practice as this, on the one ſide, or on the other. But alas the caſe is far different between the Church of <hi>England</hi> and us. For ſhe is wholly made up of Perſons thus doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully baptized, nay perhaps not baptized at all, whatever ſhe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends: and by this doubtful Baptiſm ſhe is diſclaiming all other Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in reſpect of all her Members for ſome hundreds of Years. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe I muſt confeſs, had I lived in the Church in the beginning of the third Century, when Infant-Baptiſm was creeping in, there was then a Church truly baptized, diſtinct from the Infants who here and there might perhaps be baptized, upon ſuch ſuppoſed Grounds as are mentioned by the Doctor; here (I ſay) a Separation would in my Judgment have been unwarrantable, it being but an ill Principle to ſeparate from a true Church, tho incumbred with ſome Error.</p>
            <p>But ſhould I have lived till this doubtful Baptiſm was forced on with <hi>Anathema's,</hi> till it had overtopped and quite <hi>deſtroyed</hi> in ſuch a
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:110699:31"/>
Church all Practice of baptizing Believers in reſpect of her Members, and that the whole Church were now become doubtful to me, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe had any Baptiſm at all: And therewith that ſhe had <hi>appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently left the due form of Baptiſm, which ſhe had formerly obſerved.</hi> Then I think no Man could blame me, if I left this Communion, to ſit down with thoſe who did yet retain the ancient, and <hi>only undoubted Baptiſm,</hi> both for Subject and manner of Adminiſtration; and this is our very caſe.</p>
            <p>Now ſeeing it is impoſſible for us, or any Body elſe, to hold ample Communion with all ſorts of Chriſtians (and there are ſome good folk amongſt them all) why ſhould any one of theſe Parties, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Papiſts, Prelatiſts, Presbyterians, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> expect that all ſhould come to them? or why ſhould the Doctor think we ought to joyn Communion with his Party, more than others, unleſs they could not err as well as the reſt? But ſeeing that is not to be pretended, we muſt all ſatisfy our own Souls as well as we can, where to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and where to forbear, for with all we cannot have Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; let us not then grudg one againſt another about this neceſſary Chriſtian Liberty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Page</hi> 60. The Doctor attempts to prove his Tradition, not doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, but certain in the caſe of Infant-Baptiſm; to which purpoſe he inſiſts on that Rule given by <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis,</hi> viz. <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality, Antiquity,</hi> and <hi>Conſent.</hi> But I have ſhewed already, that all theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truly taken, are all wanting in the caſe of Infant-Baptiſm; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (as for other reaſons, ſo for theſe in particular) 1. The Churches in the Apoſtles days baptized no Infants. And 2. The Greek Churches to this day do retain the Cuſtom of delaying Baptiſm (which yet is no delay) to Children, till they make Profeſſion of their Faith: and the Doctor confeſſes a few of the Fathers were againſt it. And there might be more for ought he knows, though not counted among ſuch Fathers that might deſerve as well as any. And it is known that many very learned and good Men have ſeen cauſe in this and former Ages to reject this Tradition, though it has coſt them the loſs of all that this World could afford them. And the Authorities here brought by the Doctor are not ſo ancient (ſome of them) as is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended even by his own Confeſſion, and they have been ſcan'd and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by the learned Pens of <hi>Den, Tombes, Blackwood, Fiſher, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, Delaun, Duveil,</hi> and others.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, The Doctor ſays, <hi>The Anabaptiſts themſelves cannot defend the baptizing of ſuch grown Perſons as were born and bred in the Church from Scripture, without Tradition and Practice of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:110699:32"/>As if our Saviour's Authority to <hi>teach and baptize all Nations,</hi> or to <hi>preach to every Creature,</hi> and to baptize all that believe to the end of the World, were not a ſufficient Rule to us to teach our Children, and to baptize them, <hi>Matth. 28. 19. Mark</hi> 16. 16. We ſee evidently that Jeſus Chriſt has given but one Rule to us and to our Poſterity, and therefore it was unadviſedly ſpoken, to ſay that we <hi>cannot produce one Precept for teaching and baptizing our Children,</hi> when they are grown up, <hi>being bred and born of Chriſtians,</hi> as I ſuppoſe that is his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by being <hi>bred and born in the Church.</hi> Had the Doctor conſidered that Exhortation of the Apoſtle to all Chriſtians, <hi>Epheſ. 6. Teaching Parents to bring up their Children in the Nurture and Admonition of the Lord,</hi> and to <hi>Children to obey their Parents in the Lord:</hi> And therewith the Example of the Children of the elect Lady, 2 <hi>Ep. John, Who are found walking in the Truth, as the Apoſtle and the Lady her ſelf had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Commandment from the Father,</hi> it might have paſſed for a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Precedent in this caſe, than Mans Tradition without Scripture can poſſibly be, for Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>I conclude then, that ſeeing Chriſt's Command is as clear for teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and baptizing our Children, as any other Mens Poſterity; and that it is the expreſs Duty of Chriſtian Parents to bring up their Children in the Admonition of the Lord (that is, as <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> expounds the place) <hi>to make them Chriſtians;</hi> and this Advice he gave in oppoſition <hi>to the training up Children in prophane Literature.</hi> And the Precedent of this vertuous Lady, whoſe Children, whilſt under her Care and Tuition, obeyed the Truth, and walked therein according to God's Commandment, and not as Men received Tradition from their Fathers, <hi>but as the Apoſtle had received Commandment from the Father;</hi> and ſo he exhorts them to continue, and to beware of other Doctrine, and to have <hi>no Fellowſhip</hi> with ſuch as ſhould <hi>bring any other Doctrine than that which had been delivered by the Holy Apoſtles.</hi> This may ſuffice to anſwer the Objection.</p>

               <hi>CHAP. VI. Anſwereth the Doctor's fourth Queſtion,</hi> Whether it be a Duty incumbent upon Chriſtian Parents to bring their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Baptiſm?</head>
            <p>I Marvel why the Doctor puts not the term [Infant] into his Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, he knows we are for bringing our Children to Baptiſm as ſoon as we can. But how does he prove that Chriſtian Parents are obliged to bring their Infants to Baptiſm? Why this he doth by repeating what he had ſaid under the <hi>3d</hi> Queſtion: 1. <hi>About the Lawfulneſs or Allowableneſs. 2. About the requiſite Neceſſity of Infant-Baptiſm.</hi> And therefore I only refer my Reader to what has been anſwered to theſe things in the former Chapter.</p>
            <p>And now when the Parents may very rationally expect ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from God to bring their Infants to Baptiſm; The Doctor tells us, <hi>There is no Neceſſity of having a Command, or Example to juſtify it, but it is ſufficient that it is not forbidden.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But he refers them to the Orders of the Church, and quotes <hi>Heb. 13. 17. Obey them that have the Rule over You:</hi> But never ſhews at all, <hi>who gave ſuch Orders to the Church,</hi> that <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Proparents</hi> ſhould bring their Infants to Baptiſm. And therefore all that is here ſaid is meer Talk without any good Warrant.</p>
            <p>He quotes <hi>Acts</hi> 16. 4. which ſhews that the Decrees which were ordained at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ought to be kept. And we allow it, but here's not a Word for to bring Infants to Baptiſm in theſe Decrees: but here is a Decree againſt the eating of Blood, which is little regarded by the Doctor, or however his Church does not regard it. Yet this Text of the Decrees, he would make ſerve for Infant-Baptiſm, and indeed, had the Apoſtles had Power to make ſuch a Decree, this was as fit a time and occaſion for it as could be, the Queſtion being about Infant-Circumciſion; and the Apoſtles diſannulling their Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, would certainly have given ſome Notice that they had or ought to have Baptiſm inſtead of it; but ſeeing they do not in the leaſt mention it, we may be ſure <hi>there was no Infant-Baptiſm in being at that time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:110699:33"/>The Doctor will now ſhew us the <hi>Benefits of Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> and from thence infer for the <hi>Duty of Parents and Proparents to bring them to Baptiſm;</hi> and the firſt <hi>is their Conſecration to God.</hi> As if no Infants were conſecrated to God but thoſe who are baptized. Methinks our Saviour ſhould know how to conſecrate Infants to God as well as the Doctor, but he did it only by Prayer or Bleſſing, not by baptizing them. There is no doubt but ſuch as follow his Example in devoting Infants to God by Prayer, do act warrantably, but he that will do it by baptizing them, acts without a Guide, and deprives Children of the Baptiſm of Repentance, when they come to Years, and have need of it.</p>
            <p>His <hi>ſecond Benefit is to make Infants Members of the myſtical Body of Chriſt.</hi> As if it were in Mans Power to make whom they pleaſe Members of that Body, and that when they are faſt aſleep too. Is not this the plain Conſequence of this Opinion, that all Infants un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized, being not of Chriſt's myſtical Body, muſt periſh? I know the Doctor does not hold this; but it's hard to avoid this Rock when Men are entangled in this Error, that they can make Infants Members of Chriſt's myſtical Body by ſprinkling or croſſing them with Water, and they think they can be made ſo by no other way.</p>
            <p>Now I demand of any Man, whether the whole Number of the <hi>Saved ones</hi> be not all of Chriſts myſtical Body? not doubting but it will be granted. I deſire it may be conſidered, whether theſe unbap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cized Infants whom Chriſt bleſſed, were of his myſtical Body? I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this will be granted too; and then conſider alſo whether all In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants of whom Chriſt ſaid, to them belongs the Kingdom of Heaven, are not of his myſtical Body, as it contains all ſaved ones? I believe none will deny this. The laſt Conſideration is, Whether Chriſt does ſpeak of Infants indefinitely, and as ſuch comprehends them all, and if not, how is it poſſible for any Man to know one ſort of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants from another? all dying Infants then are of the myſtical Body, as it contains all that ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>The Doctor's third Benefit, <hi>That the baptized Infant by that Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, may paſs from a State of Nature, wherein he was a Child of Wrath, to a State of Adoption of Grace, wherein he becomes a Child of God,</hi> p. 64.</p>
            <p>But is the Doctor ſure that Infants are now Children of Wrath, that is, liable to Condemnation? Sure whatever their ſtate was in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> yet they are acquitted from Damnation by the Mercy of God in the ſecond <hi>Adam:</hi> for the Lamb which was ſlain from the the Foundation of the World, has taken away the Sin of the World
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:110699:33"/>
from innocent Babes, ſo that they are not the Objects of God's Wrath, but they are Objects of his Grace and Mercy: ſee <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. 11.</p>
            <p>Who would think that ſo wiſe a Man ſhould believe that the Adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Grace is regulated by Water-Baptiſm? or that it muſt needs wait on him when he ſprinkles an Infant? for ſaith he, <hi>By that Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity they may paſs from a State of Nature,</hi> &amp;c. Now we teach and believe thus, <hi>that the Adoption of Grace goes before Water Baptiſm.</hi> And ſo taught the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Gal. 3. 26, 27. We are all the Sons of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> And then it follows, <hi>As many as have been baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt.</hi> But I think the Doctor comes very near the Papiſts <hi>opus operatum,</hi> in what he here aſſerts concerning Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>His fourth Benefit, <hi>That Infants have Baptiſm for a Sign and Seal that their Sins are pardoned, and to confer the Right of Inheritance unto ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting-Life: That Baptiſm waſhes Infants clean from Original Sin, and ſeals the Pardon of it, and the Aſſurance of God's Mercy unto them; and being cleanſed by the Waſhing of Regeneration, from the Guilt of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Vitioſity which they derived from</hi> Adam, <hi>and which made them obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the Diſpleaſure of God, they become reconcil'd to him, and acquire as certain a right to Eternal Life upon their Juſtification, as any Believer in the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now had the Doctor proved all this <hi>daintily</hi> out of the Book of God, I ſhould have thought him the <hi>fineſt</hi> Man that ever wrote about Infant Baptiſm, but when he puts me off with <hi>Origen, Irenaeus,</hi> &amp;c. I am diſpleaſed, and muſt only take him for a very Bold Man, but no certain Oracle. However he is pleaſed to add, (which was very needful for him in this place) <hi>That he cannot deny but Infants may be ſaved without Baptiſm, by the extraordinary and uncovenanted Mercies of God.</hi> Well, here is ſome comfort for unbaptized Infants: But who can think that the Covenant of Grace ſhould not reach poor Infants in the caſe of Salvation, without Baptiſm? but if any of them that are not baptized be ſaved, it muſt be by <hi>extraordinary and uncovenant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mercy.</hi> Theſe are new and ſtrange Doctrines, and ſo let them be. The Covenant of Grace was made with whole <hi>Adam, Gen.</hi> 3. 15. And therefore as Infants, <q>without their own conſent, or any act of their own, and without any exterior Solemnity, contracted the Guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Sin, and ſo are liable to all the Puniſhment which can with Juſtice deſcend upon his Poſterity, who are perſonally innocent; ſo Infants ſhall be reſtored without any Solemnity or Act of their own, or any other Men for them, by the SECOND ADAM, by the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:110699:34"/>
Redemption of Jeſus Chriſt, by his Righteouſneſs and Merits, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied either immediately, or how or when he pleaſeth to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.</q>  Dr. <hi>Taylor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His fifth Benefit, <hi>That Infants are by Baptiſm admitted into Covenant, and ingrafted into Chriſt's Body, to acquire a preſent Right to all Promiſes of the Goſpel, and particularly unto the Promiſes of the Spirit, which is ſo ready to aſſiſt initiated Perſons. This the Primitive Chriſtians</hi> (he durſt not ſay Infants) <hi>found true by Experience,</hi> &amp;c. He quotes no Scripture for all this, but <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4. which how well it agrees to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, let the Reader conſider. I am perſwaded the Doctor was ſo ſenſible of the Unapplicableneſs of theſe things to Infants, that he durſt not name them, but Perſons all along: but ſeeing he muſt mean Infants, the very recital of his Sayings, is the Confutation of them. For can he give ſo much as one Inſtance of an Infant that received the Holy Spirit upon its being baptized? And why then does he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to ſpeak what neither he nor any Man elſe can ever prove to be true? Nay he tells us in this very page, (for he is too wiſe a Man I hope to face out a Fable) <hi>he confeſſes that the Holy Ghoſt cannot be actually conferred ûpon Infants in Baptiſm, by reaſon of their natural Inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity.</hi> And yet being loth to let the Cudgles fall, it's notorious how faintly he goes on in this and the next Page, (66, 67.) at laſt concludes in a kind of an Angry <hi>Huff,</hi> ſaying, <hi>No Perſon of common Ingenuity, who hath any ſenſe of Honour, or any tollerable Degree of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience within him, can without Shame and Horror break theſe ſacred Bands aſunder, by which he was bound to God in Infancy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But good Sir conſider, we do not ſpurn againſt the good Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our Parents in deſigning us to the Service of God, tho we juſtly diſallow the irregular Methods which they fell into in ſo doing. Your Predeceſſors had their Conſecration in Infancy by <hi>Spittle, Salt, Candles, Exufflations,</hi> &amp;c. You do not think that they were bound to ratify theſe Follies when they came to Years: And truly ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we ratify your Sprinklings, Croſſings, Goſſips, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in your Conſecrations, though ſo far as you mean well, we may not deſpiſe but commond; and alſo do now that part of God's Will which our Parents miſtake would have prevented. A due Regard to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>zzah's caſe,</hi> and <hi>David's Reformation thereupon,</hi> obliges us to this. But now we are to hear from the Doctor what Profit Infant-Baptiſm brings to the Church of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The firſt,</hi> he ſays, <hi>it prevents thoſe Scandals and ſhameful Delays of Baptiſm, which otherwiſe grown Perſons would be apt to make,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:110699:34"/>To this I muſt needs ſay, If any thing without the Word of God, would induce me to baptize Children, this Conſideration of the Doctor would as ſoon prevail as any thing; for God knows this Duty is ſhamefully neglected by many whoſe Duty it is to haſten to it. <hi>But we muſt not do Evil that Good may come;</hi> We may not do what God does not command, becauſe Men will not do what he does command. And tho it be true that Men will need as many Exhortations to be bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized (and perhaps more) than to come to the Lord's Supper, yet all this muſt not diſcourage us, nor force us to innovate Methods of our own, and leave what God has preſcribed. If the faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter labour in vain ſome times, yet his Work is with the Lord, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 49. 4. But I cannot, as the Doctor does, applaud the Wiſdom of thoſe who to prevent Mens Delay of Baptiſm, ran into another Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream, by which the Church, however ſhe may be more numerous, yet by this means the Grace of Baptiſm is deſtroyed, or made unneceſſary to Baptiſm, becauſe as the learned <hi>Boſſuit</hi> confeſſes, <hi>it is ſeparated from Baptiſm in little Infants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Were good Schools for catechiſing the Youth provided, and a painful Miniſtery to keep ſuch Schools, this might be a better way to prevent the Delays of Baptiſm than to baptize Infants; for in truth, that proving <hi>no Baptiſm at all,</hi> proves <hi>the greateſt Delay of all.</hi> Now for the uſe of ſuch Schools, both the Scripture and Antiquity would ſtand by us.</p>
            <p>For when all is ſaid that can be ſaid, Baptiſm being the waſhing of Regeneration, a myſtical and ſpiritual Burial with Chriſt, the Church ought to have pious care, that none be admitted to Baptiſm, but ſuch as give ſome competent account of the Work of Faith with Power in their Souls. And hereunto agrees the Scriptures with full conſent; <hi>What hinders that I may not be baptized,</hi> ſaith the Eunuch? <hi>If thou believeſt with all thy Heart, thou mayeſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 8. 46. Acts 16. 14. Acts 2. 38. Acts 8. 12. Acts 2. 41. Acts 18. 8. Mark 16. 16.</note> 
               <hi>They that gladly received the Word, were baptized. Lidea</hi>'s Heart being opened <hi>to attend to the Word, ſhe was baptized.</hi> When the <hi>Samaritans believed, they were baptized,</hi> &amp; ſo were the <hi>Corinthians. The Galatians were Sons of God by Faith, and ſo baptized. The Romans were dead to Sin, and ſo bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized;</hi> and ſo were the <hi>Coloſſians:</hi> and ſo did our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our order it, that he <hi>that believeth, ſhould be baptized:</hi> we find none elſe by him appointed to it. In vain do Men ſtrive againſt ſuch clear Evidence of the Divine Will and Authority of Heaven, and reſt upon, and ſoar very high upon the Wing of humane Authorities: <hi>What is the Chaff to the Wheat, ſaith the Lord?</hi>

               <hi>CHAP. VII. Anſwereth the Doctor's fifth and laſt Queſtion;</hi> Whether it be lawful to Communicate with Believers, who were only bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in their Infancy? <hi>P. 72.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>IN ſtating this Queſtion, the Doctor does little more than repeat what he ſaid upon the ſecond and third Queſtions, and grants, that the ſtating of this depends upon what he ſaid to them. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what is ſaid in Anſwer to theſe Queſtions, is referr'd to in this place.</p>
            <p>He tells us, <hi>p. 73. It never entred into the Heart of any of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Chriſtians, to refuſe Communion with grown Perſons who had been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized in their Infancy.</hi> But the Queſtion is not ſo much what they did, as what ought to be done in this Caſe: Yet I muſt needs ſay, their Caſe and ours differ exceedingly, as I ſhewed in anſwer to the laſt Queſtion before this. They lived when an Error was but creep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in here and there; and it was not preſſed as neceſſary, till about the fourth Century; and ſo it may be there was no great Diviſion about it, tho it's more than the Doctor can be confident of. But we live in an Age, when Infants are not baptized, but rantized only; and the Churches allowing ſuch a practice, do not now, as then they did, conſiſt moſtly of Baptized Believers; but the Church the Doctor would have us communicate with, have not only no other Baptiſm but the ſprinkling of Babes; but have been very fierce againſt all that have oppoſed it, and aſſerted the Ancient Truth, even to the undo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, nay, to the deſtroying them from off the Earth; ſo that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:110699:35"/>
the Separation has been evidently occaſioned, by the unreaſonable and cruel proceedings of the Aſſertors of Infant-Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>It is famous in the Writings of Learned Men, that the <hi>Donatiſts</hi> and <hi>Novatians</hi> denied Infant-Baptiſm, (tho ſome of them might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it in danger of Death): And it's certain theſe Chriſtians were very conſiderable, both for Number and Piety, and were more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked by the other Party, for their ſtrictneſs about their Communion ordinarily, than for any thing of Hereſy they charg'd them with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But the <hi>Apoſtolici</hi> were more Ancient, and they are expreſly called <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> by the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> becauſe they looked upon Infant-Baptiſm as ridiculous.</p>
            <p>But now if the Doctor will have the Queſtion truly ſtated; as the Caſe is, in our Judgment and Conſcience, then it muſt be put into theſe Terms: <hi>Whether it be lawful for Baptized Believers to hold Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with ſuch Chriſtians as they think are not baptized at all?</hi> And then the Doctor is a Perſon of that diſcretion, that he himſelf muſt acknowledg that it muſt be reſolved in the <hi>Negative,</hi> till he or ſome Body elſe do convince us, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> has ſome Baptiſm, either true eſſentially, or falſe in part and form only, which would alter the Caſe. But we do believe ſhe has none at all: So that Communion with her is more difficult. We cannot conceive how <hi>Infant Baptiſm ſhould be neceſſary by the preſumptive Will of Chriſt,</hi> as the Doctor phraſeth it. Such Language is very uncouth to us, and ſeems to open a Gap for Men to preſume the Will of Chriſt to be whatſoever they pleaſe, or what by Learning and Parts they can make a plauſible Diſcourſe for.</p>
            <p>It is a weighty Conſideration, if it were true, That our Opinion <hi>does infer that there has been no true Church on Earth for 1100 Years, nor a Chruch for 1500, with whom a Chriſtian could Communicate with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin.</hi> But this cannot be true; for tho Infant-Baptiſm was an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror (in our Judgment) ever ſince it had a being, yet there was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſome Churches free of it, and thoſe we have taken notice of before to be many of the Greek Churches, as Learned Authors do confeſs, even ſuch as were themſelves for Infant-Baptiſm; and with them are to be reckoned (in this Queſtion) the <hi>Apoſtolici, Donatiſts, Novatians,</hi> and a great part of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> as is fully made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by Mr. <hi>Danvers</hi> and others, of which I ſhall here give a brief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count:</p>

            <p>Neither do we cenſure good and pious Men in the darker Times above us, who perhapps had not opportunity, as we have, to ſee and avoid the Error; God Almighty indulging the overſights of his ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Ones in all Ages, as we truſt he will do ours in this; for ſome may yet come after us to reſtore ſome Truth which we have not minded, being ſo much buſied, both by Writing, Preaching, and Suffering, in defence of ſome particular Truths which are the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy of our Age. And this was the Caſe of our worthy Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, who were called to conteſt with the Spirit of Error. And we doubt not but all ſincere Chriſtians, who have not wilfully oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed themſelves to any Truth, ſhall find Mercy in the Day of Chriſt, and receive a Reward according to the Infinite Goodneſs of God, who will not ſuffer any to go without a Reward, who have been but ſo kind to any, becauſe they belonged to Chriſt, as to give them a Cup of cold Water to drink.</p>
            <p>And in the mean time, I am for ſo much Communion with all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, as will do them and my ſelf good. But ſeeing it is impoſſible for any to maintain full or ample Communion with all ſorts, profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Chriſtian Name at this Day; There is a neceſſity either for ſome powerful Party to kill all the reſt, that ſhe may be the only Church, or elſe Brotherly to agree to permit all to chuſe their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, where they can moſt comfortably enjoy it; and I heartily deſire that none for any cauſe but true inward Peace, would make uſe of this Liberty. But about this we have more fully treated in the fifth Chapter, that here we ſhall add no more at preſent, but ſhall conclude with our humble Requeſt to the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how great a Preſſure it muſt be upon our Conſcience, to break up our Aſſemblies, which we believe to be truly conſtituted Churches, and to unite with Hers, which we believe to be ſo defective in her Conſtitution, as to have no Baptiſm at all.</p>
            <p>Now that the Baptiſm of Repentant Believers is of Heavenly Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, is granted on all hands, that it ſtands clear both in Scripture, and unqueſtionable Antiquity next to the Scripture, is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable; and that this Baptiſm is to be continued to the end of the World, cannot be ſpoken againſt.</p>
            <p>And on the other ſide, Does not even Mr. <hi>Baxter,</hi> and other Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:110699:37"/>
Aſſertors of Infant-Baptiſm, confeſs; <hi>'tis a very difficult Point to prove by Scripture?</hi> And do not the Learned <hi>Papiſts, and ſome Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Proteſtants, acknowledg there is no Scripture for Infant-Baptiſm? Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Precept nor Practice in Scripture for Infant-Baptiſm?</hi> That it was brought in <hi>without the Commandment of Chriſt? That it is only a Church Rite,</hi> and not of Divine Inſtitution? Theſe Things cannot be hid from you, and therefore there is a neceſſity that ſome ſpeedy and prudent way be taken by the Church of <hi>England</hi> to reſtore this Holy Ordinance to its purity, in reſpect of the Subject to be baptized.</p>
            <p>For though the Church of <hi>England</hi> does retain the Doctrine of Baptiſm, with reſpect to its precedency to other Ordinances, its Utility and Dignity in the Church of God; yet this is to little pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſtill, ſo long as another thing is ſubſtituted in the room of it, both in reſpect of the Subject and manner of Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>Concerning the latter, let the Church of <hi>England</hi> be intreated to conſider the Reflections which have been made upon this Alteration of Immerſion to Sprinkling, by the learned <hi>Boſſuet</hi> in his <hi>Book of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> &amp;c. And the Conviction which ſome learned Proteſtants in <hi>France</hi> have lately met with upon that occaſion. I will ſet down the words of the learned Author who calls himſelf <hi>Anonymus,</hi> as they are tranſlated by Dr. <hi>Duveil</hi> upon the Acts of the Apoſtles, <hi>p.</hi> 292, 293.</p>
            <q>
               <p>It is moſt certain that Baptiſm hath not been adminiſtred hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, otherwiſe than by Sprinkling, by the moſt part of Proteſtants, but truly this Sprinkling is an Abuſe. This Cuſtom which without an accurate Examination, they have retained from the Romiſh Church, in like manner as many other things, makes their Baptiſm very defective, it corrupteth its Inſtitution and ancient uſe, and that nearneſs of Similitude, which is needful ſhould be betwixt it and Faith, Repentance, and Regeneration.</p>
               <p>This Reflection of Mr. <hi>Boſſuit</hi> deſerveth to be ſeriouſly conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to wit, that this uſe of plunging hath continued for the ſpace of a whole thouſand and three hundred Years; that hence we may underſtand, that we did not carefully, as was meet, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine things which we retained from the Roman Church; and therefore ſince the moſt learned Biſhops of that Church do teach us now that the Cuſtom eſtabliſhed by moſt grave Arguments, and ſo many Ages, was aboliſhed by her, this ſelf-ſame thing was very unjuſtly done by her, and that the Conſideration of our Duty doth require at our hands, that we ſeek again the primitive Cuſtom of the Church, and the Inſtitution of Chriſt.—Though therefore
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:110699:37"/>
we ſhould yield to Mr. <hi>Boſſuet</hi> that we are convinced by the force of his Arguments, that the Nature and Subſtance of Baptiſm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth in Dipping, what may he hope for from us, but that the Profeſſors ſee themſelves obliged to him by no ſmall Favour, and thank him that he hath delivered us from Error, when we greatly erred in this thing?</p>
               <p>And as we are reſolved indeed to correct and rectify this Error; ſo we deſire earneſtly with humble Prayer of him, that he would correct and amend that Error of taking away the Cup from the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icks</hi> coming unto the holy Supper. Does Monſieur <hi>Boſſuet</hi> think that the Proteſtants will have a greater reſpect of that Cuſtom which they have ſound to be unlawful, and that by the moſt weighty and ſolid Arguments, than of the Inſtitution of Jeſus Chriſt, and that to let <hi>Rome</hi> get an opportunity of boldly and freely breaking the Laws of Chriſt, by the pernicious Imitation of our Example.</p>
               <p>Far be that wicked frame of Mind from them: they are ſtraiter bound by the Authority of their holy Maſter, than to deſpiſe his Voice when his Sound cometh to their Ears, <hi>My Sheep hear my Voice;</hi> and again, <hi>I know my Sheep.</hi> None, except Wolves lurking under a Sheep-skin, refuſeth and turneth from it.—There is no Place therefore for cogging in theſe things, for thoſe that pretend the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Title <hi>of received Cuſtom</hi> for the Days Practice, when Jeſus and his Goſpel is not the Cuſtom, but the Truth. <hi>From the beginning it was not ſo,</hi> ſays the ſame Jeſus unto them, who did object unto him the worſt and curſed Cuſtom of their Anceſtors.</p>
               <p>When we ſhall be preſented before the Judgment of Chriſt, he will not judg his Diſciples by Cuſtom, but by the lively and effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Word of his Goſpel. Neither ſhould any be taken with a vain hope of framing an Excuſe from the Authority of the Church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all the Authority of the Church is from Chriſt granted unto her for that intent and purpoſe, that ſhe might procure a Religious Obedience to his Laws, and Heavenly Precepts, but not that ſhe might break, repeal and cancel them.—There is in the Church no more Power of changing the Rites in the Sacraments, than there is Power of changing his Word and Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus far the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and pious Proteſtant.</p>
            </q>
            <p>And ſhall the religious French Proteſtants be thus awakened and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to correct and rectify this Error, by the Reflections made upon it by an Enemy; and ſhall the Engliſh Proteſtants add yet more Slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, notwithſtanding they have not only the very ſame <hi>Alarm</hi> come
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:110699:38"/>
amongſt them from the ſame Pen; but their own Learned Men who ſtand upon their Watch-towers, have given them notice of this <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm-deſtroying Error.</hi> And beſides this, God has raiſed up Witneſſes for his Truth in this as well as other Particulars, who with great Learning and Judgment have ſhown the Beauty of this Inſtitution both by Doctrine, and by the Practice of it in the Royal City, and in moſt Parts of this Land, for many Years together; and yet the Church of <hi>England</hi> does not ſtir up her ſelf at all, to take hold of plain Truth in this matter.</p>
            <p>And tho I am one of the leaſt of the Witneſſes which God has rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up in this Age and Nation in behalf of this Truth, yet I ſhall humbly crave leave to addreſs the Church of <hi>England</hi> after this friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and free manner, <hi>as I did Mr.</hi> Boſſuet <hi>himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>1. I beſeech her to conſider that ſhe has now to do with ſuch Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians as are in good earneſt for the ancient Chriſtian Religion, as it was delivered by Chriſt and his Apoſtles; ſuch as would not have any Truth, delivered by Heavens Authority, to be neglected, nor in any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe to be corrupted by Innovation, Change or Alteration, but reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly obſerved and kept, according to the due Form and Power of Godlineſs.</p>
            <p>2. As to <hi>the Caſe of Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> be pleaſed to conſider, that the Salvation of our Infants are as dear to us as yours can be to you, and therefore you have no reaſon to think that we would willingly omit any thing which God has appointed as a furtherance thereunto; and being, as all Men know, no leſs zealous for the Ordinance of Baptiſm than your ſelves, you may be confident we would by no means hinder its due extent, but promote it therein by all lawful means we are able.</p>
            <p>3. That our Lord Jeſus has made Baptiſm neceſſary to the Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Infants, is not revealed in the holy Scripture; nor that he has made it neceſſary for them at all; and therefore, as the <hi>African Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil</hi> did ill to <hi>Anathematize</hi> thoſe that denied the firſt, ſo you have not done well to <hi>Anathematize</hi> ſuch as cannot in Conſcience bring their Infants to Baptiſm.</p>
            <p>4. Let therefore our Brethren of the Church of <hi>England</hi> return to the Truth in the Caſe of holy Baptiſm, that we may return to her; for when it ſhall be ſo with her, ſhe will diſtinguiſh between the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and the Vile; yea that very Miniſtration rightly reſtored, will naturally lead to a far greater Purity in Church-Communion, than has hitherto been attained. But if ſhe will not be intreated to amend her Ways and her Doings, the Lord will plead the Cauſe of his neglected Truth and deſpiſed People.</p>

            <head>The CONCL<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>SION.</head>
            <p>THE Doctor was pleaſed to reſerve ſome of our Objections<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Paedobaptiſts for the Concluſion of his Book. Now the Reader does underſtand, that tho we ſhew like Arguments for Infant-Communion, as they bring for Infant-Baptiſm, both from Scripture and Antiquity, yet we do not therefore hold that they are to be brought to the holy Table of the Lord; but we do hereby ſhew that the Poedobaptiſt is not conſiſtent with himſelf, as for example:</p>
            <p>This Doctor argues for Infant-Baptiſm from 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 2. that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Infants paſſed through the Sea;</hi> and it's ſaid, <hi>All our Fathers were baptized unto</hi> Moſes <hi>in the Cloud and in the Sea,</hi> therefore Infants were baptized to <hi>Moſes,</hi> and conſequently ought to be baptized to Chriſt. Now to ſhew the Fallacy of this Argument, we ſay, <hi>All</hi> that are ſaid to be baptized, <hi>ver.</hi> 2. are alſo ſaid <hi>to eat and drink ſpiritually of Chriſt;</hi> ſo that this Scripture is as ſtrong for Infant-Communion, as for Infant-Baptiſm; tho in Truth it's no Rule for either. For how ſhould it follow, that becauſe God ſaved <hi>Iſrael</hi> miraculouſly from the Rage of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> in the Cloud, and in the Red Sea, and fed them miraculouſly with Mannah and Water in the Wilderneſs; Therefore we are to baptize and communicate Infants. But we have ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that the Apoſtle does limit this Baptiſm, and feeding upon Chriſt, to thoſe of Underſtanding, [to wit, our Fathers] and ſo doth <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> ſpeaking of the latter in theſe words, <hi>Quicunque in Manna Chriſtum intellexerunt, eundem quem nos cibum ſpiritualem man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducaverunt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhew alſo from this 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 17. that all that are baptized in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one Body, are to partake of one Bread at the Lord's Table: and therefore it will follow that if Infants ought to be baptized into the Church Militant, they ought not to be denied the Bread and Cup in the Communion of that Body.</p>
            <p>When they plead from Antiquity, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we ſhew them (and they know it) that <hi>near the ſecond or early Ages of the Goſpel, Infants were brought to the Lord's Table to communicate there,</hi> and that this <hi>Cuſtom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued 600 Years,</hi> yet it was laid aſide as unwarrantable, and we ſhew there is equal reaſon to lay aſide the Cuſtom of baptizing Infants. But we have more particularly ſhewed theſe things in our <hi>Animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:110699:39"/>
               <hi>upon Dr. S. his Digreſſions about Infant-Baptiſm:</hi> Wherein alſo the Subſtance of this Book of the <hi>Caſe of Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> is redargued; and indeed this Book ſeems to have been added as an Enlargement up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe ſhort Notes of Dr. <hi>Stillingfleet,</hi> though done perhaps by another Hand.</p>
            <p>I ſhall therefore ſay no more at preſent to the Doctor's Concluſion, nor ſhall I take notice of Mr. <hi>Philpot</hi>'s Dream; he was doubtleſs a good Man, yet that he did dream waking, as well as when aſleep, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enough to all that will conſider how extreme weakly he goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to prove Infants to be Believers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But let us not trouble the Dead, we ſhall ere long be with them, where all our Miſtakes will be made manifeſt, and all our unavoidable Infirmities will be pardoned. But if any Man ſin preſumptuouſly, the ſame reproacheth the Lord: And happy is the Man who ſincerely ſeeks for Truth, and faithfully walks up to his Light, tho through unavoidable Weakneſs he may err in many things. For our God knoweth our Frame, and whereof we are made, and remembers that we are but Duſt, and like as a Father pities his [willing tho weak] Son, even ſo the Lord pittieth them that fear him. To him therefore be Glory for ever.</p>

            <head>An <hi>APPENDIX</hi> concerning the Sign of the Croſs in Baptiſm.</head>
            <p>BEcauſe there is bound up with the <hi>Caſe of Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe called, <hi>The Caſe of the Sign of the Croſs in Baptiſm,</hi> We ſhall take ſo much notice of it as to ask, (in <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s words, <hi>

And he has a clearer Text for it too (if <hi>Jerome</hi> ſay true) than any which has been yet alledged for Infant-Baptiſm, <hi>viz.</hi> Ezek. 9. 4. <hi>Set a Mark upon the Foreheads of the Men that ſigh.</hi> He tells us that by ſeveral <hi>of the Hebrew Verſions, this mark is ſuppoſed to be by the Hebrew <gap reason="foreign">

            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="69" facs="tcp:110699:39"/>It ſeems theſe two Caſes, <hi>Infant-Baptiſm,</hi> and <hi>the Sign of the Croſs in Baptiſm,</hi> ſtands much upon the ſame bottom, and will ſtand and fall together. Howbeit we ſhall not do much more about this caſe, than to be the Remembrancer of this Generation with what Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny has formerly been given againſt this piece of Superſtition, by learned Proteſtants themſelves, even ſuch as were our Oppoſites in the other caſe, who to this <hi>Plea</hi> of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> that they receive not the ſign of the Croſs as from the Papiſts, but from the Fathers of the Primitive Church, gives them this Anſwer.</p>
            <p>1. The Fathers can be no Vizard for a Rite whereof the Pagans, Jews, or Hereticks were the Fathers and firſt begetters. It was the Fault of one <hi>Alexander,</hi> that he ſang the Pſalms of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinus;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> againſt <hi>Saund.</hi> c. 13.</note> It is ours, that we uſe his Croſs. I call it his, becauſe he was the firſt that uſed this Sign, the very firſt that made account of it, as appears by <hi>Irenaeus, lib. 1. c.</hi> 1. And he did wreſt the Scriptures to the Croſſes Commendation.—He termed him <hi>Crux</hi> to ſhew a purging Power in him, becauſe he held the Croſs a Purger of Man's Sin.—And that he was drawn into this Opinion by the ſame means that Papiſts are drawn into it, by a ſuppoſed Dedication of it in the Blood of Chriſt [not conſidering that by this conceit Men may adore every Thorn-Buſh, becauſe the Holy Head of Jeſus was embrued with Blood by that Crown of Thorns wherewith he was crowned.] And <hi>Valentinus</hi> does confeſs his <hi>A<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>on</hi> was without a Figure, until Chriſt by his Death upon the Croſs gave him one, and till now we never read of any that uſed the Figure of the Croſs before him, or made any account of it. And therefore he it is (for ought we know) even <hi>Valentinus,</hi> that firſt brought it into Requeſt and Reckoning. And who then will ſuffer us to ſay we borrow it from the Fathers, and not from him?—See we not then, that to ſay we follow the Fathers in the Croſs, (<hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinus</hi> the Heretick being the firſt Deviſer of it) we are forced to fly like <hi>Eutropius</hi> to the very ſame Sanctuary, which we have denied and ſhut up to others.</p>
            <p>The Fathers can be no Vizard for a Ceremony which has been abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſince, or what though from the Fathers we take this ſign? This helpeth not till the Fathers uſe be juſtified, which will never be.—He that readeth the Fathers Writings will meet indeed with ſuch a <hi>Chaos,</hi> as will make him afraid, (I ſay not to fall into it) but even to behold it. Who can brook the Efficacy which <hi>Tertullian</hi> gave it? <hi>The Fleſh is ſigned, that the Soul may be defended.</hi> The Neceſſity which <hi>Cyprian</hi>
               <pb n="70" facs="tcp:110699:40"/>
gave it in Baptiſm, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngi neceſſe baptizatum—baptizati ſigno Dominico conſumantur.</hi> The Fathers call this ſign <hi>Spirituale Signaculum,</hi> (to wit) becauſe it bringeth the Spirit, for which one place may ſerve our turn, <hi>Sequitur ſpirituale Signaculum, quia poſt fontem ſupereſt ut per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectio fiat, quando ad invocationem Sacerdos, Spiritus fanctus infunditur.</hi> And in the opinion of the Fathers the Water of Baptiſm is nothing worth without the Croſs. In the opinion of the Fathers, the Croſs is the Terror of the Devil, and an impregnable Wall againſt him, ſo that they uſed the Croſs themſelves when in any danger. In the opinion of the Fathers the Croſs is <hi>Inſigne Regni, et clavis Paradiſi.</hi> Laſt of all in the opinion of the Fathers, the Croſs is ſo neceſſary, as that it is to be made, coming and going, ſitting and ſtanding, even <hi>ad omnem inceſſum,</hi> at every ſtop; and <hi>ad omnem actum,</hi> in every Action that we do.</p>
            <p>And to ſhew the Superſtition of the Croſs from <hi>Tertullian,</hi> take a View of it, as ſet down by the <hi>Author of the caſe of the Croſs—<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon every motion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>at their going out, and coming in, when they put on their Garments or Shoes, at the</hi> Bath, <hi>or at Meals, when they lighted up their Candles, or went to Bed, whatever almoſt they did in any part of their Converſation, ſtill they would even wear out their Foreheads with the Sign of the Croſs.</hi> And is not this a ſad Story? yet our Author brings this in Favour of it.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> is brought in as drawing Mr. <hi>Goulart</hi> as it were by the Hair of the Head, to clear the Fathers from the Superſtition of the Croſs, which he doth not, ſave in compariſon of the Popiſh Merit and Enchantment which afterward crept in. As for the operative Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er which they placed in the Oily Croſs, he flatly condemneth them.</p>
            <p>And whereas it is ſaid that the Croſs (among Proteſtants) coming after the Water (in Baptiſm) is an Acknowledgment of its Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it. My Author anſwers, This ill beſeemeth our Mouths, who cannot endure the Papiſt when he makes the ſame excuſe. The Croſs which cometh after the Conſecration in the Lords Supper belongeth not to it. We oppoſe againſt him: The Conſecration doth reach to the whole Adminiſtration, whatſoever Sign is adminiſtred it cannot but (at leaſt) in ſhew pertain to it. Therefore it is a part of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſaith the <hi>Canon.</hi> So all the while the Croſs is within the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of Baptiſm, it is morally a part thereof: for Example, the Feaſt came after the worſhipping of the Calf; yet becauſe it pertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Solemnity, the Apoſtle not only counteth it a part of the Idols Service but ſuch a principal part as includeth all the reſt that went before, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:110699:40"/>If thou haſt made a Separation, (between the Croſs and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) thou haſt made a fair hand. This very Separation maketh the Croſs to be a ſign of a divers ſpecies, and ſo by conſequent to be an Addition, which is unlawful: And the matter of this Separation (boaſted of) maketh the after-place of the Croſs yet worſe—For what though the Croſs and the Water be divers in matter? So are the Bread and the Wine in the Supper, [yet] they make one Refecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Chriſt, and ſo grow to be formally one: and ſo may theſe grow to be one likewiſe, becauſe they make one inveſting into the Church. And doth not the Croſs touch the Water as near as the Wine doth touch the Bread? The Poſtation of the Wine doth not prejudice it, therefore the poſtponing of the Croſs doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice it.—As long as the Croſs and the Water [our Croſs and the Popiſh] are ſeen in the ſame Solemnity of Baptiſm, the Separation is inſufficient.—Is not Baptiſm the Seal of the Heavenly King? and can any new print be added to the Seal of a King without Treaſon? Do we not cry out upon the Dove, let down of old upon the baptized for a Sign of Regeneration by the Spirit? (one of which I ſaw (ſaith my Author) at <hi>Wickham</hi> not aboliſhed ſome 25 Years paſt) ſure, a Sign in ſuch manner determined, with State in Baptiſm, we can eaſily prove to have been abhorred throughout all Ages, however in the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of the Croſs, the Oyl and ſome other Signs, God permitted the ancient Fathers to fail in Heart to bring in (through their overſight againſt their own general<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doctrine) that Apoſtacy from the Faith which he foretold. [Thus much concerning the Croſs as grounded upon Antiquity, or as coming from the Fathers.]</p>
            <p>2. Concerning that Text in <hi>Ezekiel</hi> 9. 4. Our Author ſaith that ſome of the Authors whom <hi>Jerom</hi> followed underſtood this Sign to be ſpiritual and not an outward <hi>Mark,</hi> which is alſo the Tenent of our Writers: [Dr. <hi>Fulk</hi> againſt <hi>Martin.</hi>] If our Oppoſites have found out ſince the Sign of the outward Croſs in this pla<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

[and after he has ſet down various opinions about altering the form of the Hebrew Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, he tells us out of <hi>Baronius,</hi> that <hi>Ezra</hi> never changed the Hebrew Letters, that the old ancient Copies of the Hebrew Bibles were many of them remaining<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in <hi>Ezra</hi>'s time, and that they are all in one Character, to wit, the old and ancient Characters of the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews.—And that the whole matter is of late brought clearly to light by <hi>Jo. Scaliger,</hi> who writes thus, <hi>The old Hebrew and Samaritan</hi> Letters be all one, and the Letter <hi>Tau</hi> in neither of them is like a

Croſs, or the Greek or Roman <hi>T. Hierom</hi> what he writes of <hi>Ezras</hi>'s altering the old Samaritan <hi>Tau,</hi> he taketh word by word out of <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen,</hi> in <hi>Romanos. Origen</hi> was deceived by a Jew, on whoſe bare Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he grounded himſelf, which Relation was alſo falſe.—We muſt give the Fathers leave to play, according to their own Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, not only to fetch the ſign of the Croſs out of this <hi>Tau,</hi> but alſo out of the two Sticks which the Widow of <hi>Sarepta</hi> gathered, yea to fetch a Croſs and a <hi>T</hi> too out of the 300 Souldiers of <hi>Gideon.</hi> And (as the Author of the Caſe of the Croſs tells us) <q>They of the Romiſh Church can diſcern the Croſs in the Figure of a Mans Face, by the placing the Noſe betwixt the two Eyes, and much more in the whole Body of Man with his Arms extended: They can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern it in the Sword in Paradiſe, and in the Croſs Stick that <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove brought back into the Ark. And indeed ſome of the Fathers (ſaith he) bent their Imaginations ſomething that way, and would fancy the Figure of the Croſs in <hi>Moſes</hi> ſtretching out his Arms while the Iſraelites were ſighting with <hi>Amaleck,</hi> and in the paſchal Lamb when the Spit went through it.</q> Surely theſe things may ſufficiently inform us, that let Men be never ſo great, or never ſo much reverenced as Fathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet God is no Reſpecter of Perſons, but if they will follow their own fancies, and be adding to his Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, he will even ſmite them with Stupidity, that the Childiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Fathers may appear to very Children; and that all may fear God, and keep his Commandments, without adding to them, or taking from them, according to <hi>Deut. 12. 32. Deut.</hi> 4. 2.</p>
            <p>3. There is a great pretence that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the great had Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on probably from Heaven to make this ſign of the Croſs in his Banner; becauſe he dreamed he ſaw ſuch a ſign in the Firmament with <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in hoc vince,</hi> [overcome in this] written in it. To this it is anſwered.</p>
            <p>It was not the Sign of the Croſs that appeared, but a ſight ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like it, to wit, a mark of Chriſt's Name X<hi rend="sup">o</hi> P. after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner X<hi rend="sup">o</hi>, or as <hi>Lypſius</hi> upon the view of ancient Copies draws it after another manner more different from the ſign of the Croſs, than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. The former of theſe cometh neareſt to the Deſcription of <hi>Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> therefore the latter may be ſome Imitation of it. But be this Dream or Viſion what it will, we find not that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> had any Authority to turn it into a Religious Ritual, much leſs to make it conſecratory to many Rites in Worſhip, and particularly in Baptiſm. Theſe are after-Inventions: for whatſoever Honour hath accrued to the Croſs (ſaith our Author) by this Dream or Viſion, it came either from the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:110699:41"/>
               <hi>Alchymie</hi> of the Biſhops in thoſe days who drew a Croſs out of the ſight which <hi>Conſtantine</hi> ſaw, or from the Sophiſtry of Papiſts ſince.</p>
            <p>The Truth is the Viſion which St. <hi>Steven</hi> ſaw at his Martyrdom, <hi>Acts</hi> 7. and that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had at his Converſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. are not only delivered to us by Divine Teſtimony, but were nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour to that of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> which whether it were a Dream or a Viſion, is not certain, the Story giving it both ways; yet who ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd to turn the Viſions of St. <hi>Stephen</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> into Rituals, or to aſſix them to Chriſt's Ordinances? When Men do aſſume this Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty without Divine Warrant, many Evils do follow upon ſuch doings. How much innocent Blood has been ſhed about this ſign of the Croſs, is not eaſily to be eſtimated? and indeed for the ſake of this and other ſuch Inventions, Chriſtians have hated one another with cruel Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, as late Years have ſhewed. Men more account of thoſe Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, than of the Word of God by far. We have ſeen it with our Eyes. A Man might be a common Drunkard, and yet permitted to preach in the Pulpit. But if he would not uſe the ſign of the Croſs, and the Surplice, away with him. This kind of Zeal ſhews that it's from beneath, it is not of God.</p>
            <p>And ſo long as theſe things remain, and are forced on by Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there will be continual Strife, Contention, and Devouring amongſt Chriſtians: as it was ſo from the Beginning of them, ſo it will be to the end of them: becauſe an evil Plant will bring forth ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to its Nature. We have more ſacred Inſtitutions, then we can well obſerve. Why do we ſeek to burthen our ſelves or others, in matters of Religion, with the Commandments and Doctrines of Men? all which are to periſh; and God in Mercy haſten the time, that God's People may have but one Heart, and one Way.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. I.</hi> Of the Manner of Marriages among the Baptized Believers, and that they are warrantable by God's Law.</head>
               <p>SOme of the Baptized Believers having been proſecuted as Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, for not conforming to the Ceremonies of the Ring, and kneeling to the Altar in the Celebration of Marriage; we ſhall therefore humbly offer our Reaſons why we diſſent from theſe Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies; and why alſo our Marriages are good in the Eye of the Law, (for the Subſtance of them) the omiſſion of theſe Ceremonies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p>But firſt the Reader is deſired to take notice, that we are not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, but for the publick Solemnization of Marriage according to the Law of the Land, ſave that there are ſome Ceremonies uſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in which we cannot comply with. And becauſe ſome of the Prieſts will not marry us at all, and others will not do it, unleſs we conform to all the Ceremonies required in the Service-Book; this puts us upon a neceſſity to have it done without them, and the manner thus:</p>
               <p>The Parties to be married being qualified for that State of Life, according to the Law of God, and the Law of the Land, as to the Degrees, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> therein limited; They call together a competent num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of their Relations and Friends: And having uſually ſome of our Miniſtry preſent with them, the Parties concern'd do declare their Contract formerly made between Themſelves, and with the Advice of their Friends, if Occaſion require it: <hi>And then taking each other by the Hand, do declare, That they from that day forward, during their natural Lives together, do enter into the State of Marriage, uſing the Words, or the ſubſtance of them, which are appointed for the Words of Marriage in the Service-Book, (as acknowledging them Words to be very fit for that purpoſe.) And then a Writing is ſigned by the Parties married,</hi>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:110699:42"/>
                  <hi>to keep in memory the Contract and Covenant of their Marriage, to this effect:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Theſe are to teſtify to all Men, that we</hi> A. B. <hi>of,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and</hi> C. D. <hi>of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> &amp;c. <hi>have, the day of the Date hereof, entred into the Covenant and State of Marriage, according to a ſolemn Contract heretofore made between our ſelves, and with the Conſ<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nt of ſuch as are concern'd in order thereunto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And we do now, in the Preſence of Almighty God, and the Witneſſes here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after named, ratify the ſaid Contract and Covenant. Act of Marriage this day verbally made; in both which we do, in the Fear of God, mutually and ſolemnly, and for our Pares reſpectively promiſe, in the Strength of God, to live together in the State of Marriage, according to God's Ordinance, from this day forward, to love each other as Husband and Wife, and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to perform all the Duties to which we are bound by God's Law, and the good Laws of the Land, in that Caſe provided, till the Lord by Death ſhall ſeparate us. In Teſtimony whereof we have hereunto ſet our Hands,</hi> the day of, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then is annexed a Certificate of the Witneſſes, thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>WE whoſe Names are ſubſcribed, do teſtify, That the above-ſaid</hi> A. B. <hi>and</hi> C. D. <hi>the Day and Year above-ſaid, did mutually take each other into the State of Marriage, acknowledging the Contract and Covenant, and ratifying the ſame by Word, and by the Subſcription thereof as above-ſaid. In Witneſs whereof, we do hereunto ſet our Hands the Day and Year above-ſaid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After theſe things, ſome ſuitable Counſel or Inſtruction is given to the Parties (but no Man takes upon him the Office to marry any, that being the proper Act of the Parties themſelves) and then Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is made to God for his Bleſſing upon the Parties married, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now whether Marriages thus made, are juſtifiable by the Law of God, is firſt to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>To begin with the Inſtitution of Marriage, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2. 23, 24. there we find all that is eſſential to Marriage: For he that had the right to diſpoſe of the Woman, was pleaſed to bring her and give her to <hi>Adam.</hi> And <hi>Moſes</hi> tells us, That <hi>they who are thus joined together, are one Fleſh;</hi> and are to forſake all other Relations in compariſon of that Relation.</p>
               <p>The Marriage-Covenant is explained by God himſelf, <hi>Mal. 2. 14. She is thy Companion, and Wife of thy Covenant, of which he himſelf</hi>
                  <pb n="76" facs="tcp:110699:43"/>
(ſays the Prophet) <hi>had been a Witneſs:</hi> For whoever elſe are Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in this Caſe, God is the Principal, and will puniſh ſuch as break their Marriage-Covenant.</p>
               <p>And thus it appears, that a Marriage-Covenant between Perſons who may lawfully marry, with Witneſs upon it, are the Eſſentials of this Ordinance; which is yet more evident in the Caſe of <hi>Boaz</hi> and <hi>Ruth,</hi> Ruth. 4. 9, 10, 11. And then we may be ſure that God appointed no Ceremony in the Inſtitution of Marriage; nor do we find any Ceremony made neceſſary to the Celebration of Marriage in the Old and New Teſtament; for that paſſage of <hi>looſing the Shoe, Deut.</hi> 25. 7, 9. and <hi>Ruth</hi> 4. 7. pertains not to Marriage, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns him that refuſes to raiſe up Seed in <hi>Iſrael</hi> to his deceaſed Brother.</p>
               <p>And as there is no Ceremony ordained, ſo there is no one certain Form for the Celebration of Marriage appointed by the Word of God; but this ſeems rather to be left to Liberty, as appears in the Caſe of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> Gen. 24. 67. and the Marriage of <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 29. 21, 22, 23. and many others.</p>
               <p>The chief Things to be obſerved in Marriage, ſince the Earth was repleniſhed with Inhabitants, are theſe, <hi>That regard be had to Religion,</hi> that a Believer marry not with an Infidel; that the Perſons to be married, come not <hi>within the Degrees prohibited</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanguinity</hi> and <hi>Affinity.</hi> That the Conjunction, and Marriage-Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant be between one Man and one Woman; plurality of Wives is ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly irreconcileable with the Inſtitution of Marriage, and with the Doctrine of the Goſpel, as appears <hi>Mat. 19. 8. 1 Cor.</hi> 7. 2.</p>
               <p>And becauſe our Bleſſed Saviour has taught his Followers to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern what Corruptions have crept into God's Ordinances, by ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the firſt Inſtitution of them, and particularly this of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 8. for here he takes down even a Precept of <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe it could not ſtand with the Purity and Simplicity of Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age in the Inſtitution of it. We therefore confeſs, with the Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Caſuiſt, Mr. <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> that though <hi>the Conjunction of Male and Female, whereby Mankind is propagated, is a thing moſt worthy the care of Laws;</hi> yet where God's Law is known, it is eſpecially to be conſulted, both for Matter and Form, in the Things he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. And therefore we doubt not, but what Rules are given by the Law of God in the Caſe of Marriage are ſufficient, at leaſt ſo far, as that ſuch as are married according to them have all things that are neceſſary to juſtify their Marriages in the ſight of God and
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:110699:43"/>
Man. Otherwiſe it will greatly reflect upon the Wiſdom and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, to ſay he has made this Ordinance for the Good of Mankind, and yet left it defective in the very Eſſentials of it; and ſure it would magnify Man too much to ſuppoſe him capable to mend this Ordinance, but <hi>if God make any thing crooked, it cannot be made ſtreight, and that which he hath not made at all, cannot be numbred [with his Works, or counted a neceſſary part of them.</hi>] Eccleſ. 1. 14, 15.</p>
               <p>And ſeeing no Ceremony in Marriage has been impoſed by the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty (as in ſome other of his Ordinances he has appointed) let no Man judg one another to be unlawfully married, becauſe ſome Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies deviſed by Men are not obſerved, perhaps it might be as ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argued <hi>retro,</hi> That they who have taken upon them to add ſuch their deviſed Toys, (as Dr. <hi>Willit</hi> calls the Popiſh Ceremonies) have not true Marriage. But as the firſt is groundleſs, ſo this would be uncharitable.</p>
               <p>And therefore we deny not but that ſome decent Uſages or Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies may be appointed by Authority for the more convenient Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of Marriage, and that the Contempt of them may be juſtly corrected, for the Honour of the Power Magiſtratical: But then it is alſo to be conſidered, that as in other Ordinances of God, ſo alſo in this, Men, yea Authorities in moſt Nations of the World, have groſly abuſed this Liberty, by ordaining things ridiculous and ſinful in the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnizing of their Nuptial Contracts, as ſhall be ſhewed. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when and where ſuch Prophanations are found, it is commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble always, and ſometimes neceſſary, for ſuch as God has enlightened to ſee ſuch Corruptions, to endeavour after a modeſt and prudent manner, to have all the Ways of God, and particularly this of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, to have them, I ſay, reſtored to their Purity, by being purged from ſuch things as tend to the Profanation of them.</p>
               <p>And herein the Learned of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are our Prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents: for when they came to conſider the Popiſh Ceremonies uſed in their Marriages, they were ſo far from conforming to them, or judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe Marriages to be null which were made without them, that they boldly teſtify againſt them, and ſome laid down their Lives a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Martyrs in oppoſition to the Papiſts Opinion and Practice in the caſe of Marriage, as <hi>Woodman</hi> and <hi>Benbridg.</hi> This is teſtified by Dr. <hi>Willit, Synopſ.</hi> p. 679. And where alſo he labours much to ſhew the Errors of the Papiſts, both in their Doctrine and Practice concerning Marriage, and their Ceremonies uſed therein, and particularly upon this ground, Becauſe they made the Celebration of Marriage a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:110699:44"/>
or religious Act, and had no word of Inſtitution in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures for ſo doing.</p>
               <p>This therefore which has been ſaid concerning the Eſſentials of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, will (as we conceive) warrant our Marriage-Covenants and Contracts, to be according to God's Law; And tho we deſire and endeavour to come as near as we can to the Cuſtom of our Nation in the Celebration of Marriage, which we confeſs to be of the Nature of moral and civil Contracts of the higheſt degree, and therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the cognizance of the Power Magiſtratical; yet when the Church of <hi>England</hi> interpoſes with her Power Eccleſiaſtical, to oblige us to the obſervance of her Ceremonies, which are not of the Eſſence of Marriages, nor, ſo far as we can judg, ſuch as we can anſwer to God, nor act in with the Peace of our own Souls, we are then conſtrained, as in other caſes, ſo in this, to ſatisfy our ſelves in a diligent obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance of the Rules of God's Law, both for the Subſtance and Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of our Nuptial Contracts; and in ſo doing, we ſuppoſe both the Statute and Civil Law, as well as the Law of Reaſon, will at leaſt ſo far favour us, as to vindicate us therein to have all things neceſſary and eſſential to the ſolemn Ordinance of Marriage, which alſo we ſhall endeavour to demonſtrate in the next Section.</p>

               <p>THAT this alſo is no uncertain Poſition, but a clear Truth, will appear, if we conſider, firſt, That the chief Grounds or prime Foundations of the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are clearly for us; for thus ſaith a learned Lawyer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The firſt Ground of the Law of</hi> England <hi>is the Law of Reaſon, which is to be kept in this Realm as it is in all other Realms, and as of neceſſity it muſt be; and becauſe it is written in the Heart, therefore it may not be put away nor changed; it is never changeable by diverſity of Place nor Time; and therefore againſt this Law, Preſcription, Statute, nor Cuſtom may not prevail: and if any be brought againſt it, they be not Preſcriptions, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, nor Cuſtomes, but Things void and againſt Juſtice.</hi> Doct. &amp; Stud. l. 1. c. 5. &amp;c. 2.</p>

                  <hi>The ſecond Ground of the Law of</hi> England <hi>is the Law of God.</hi> And upon theſe Grounds (I ſuppoſe) was that excellent Statute made in the caſe of Marriage, wherein we have theſe Words, as they are quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a learned Man, <hi>viz. That no Reſervation or Prohibition (God's Law except) ſhall trouble or impeach any Marriage, 22 Hen. 8. c. 38. Will. Synop. p.</hi> 711. Of which Statute, Biſhop <hi>Hall</hi> gives this account, <hi>i. e. The Statute of 32. Hen. 8. c. 38. intending to marr the Romiſh Market of gainful and injurious Diſpenſations, profeſſeth to allow all Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages that are not prohibited by God's Law:</hi> and this Law is not yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed. And therefore it hence appears that no Law was then thought neceſſary to the Eſſence of Marriage, but the Law of God. And tho there be a Proviſo in a certain Statute made in the Reign of <hi>Edw.</hi> 6. that this Statute ſhall not give Liberty to marry without the Ceremonies appointed in the Service-Book, yet it does not null any Marriages that had been, or that might after be made with the Omiſſion of them, or at leaſt ſome of them: for Marriages we know there have been, and are frequently made by divers Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> without the Banes, and ſome other Rites, as well as by Licences obtained, which could not be done, if the Intent of the ſaid Proviſo were to make all Marriages null and void, which are made without Banes, and all the Rites appointed in the Service-Book.</p>
               <p>But leſt this ſhould be taken for my private Opinion only, I will here alledg the Judgment of ſuch as are eſteemed among the beſt learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Law, whether we reſpect the Statute or Civil Law. And firſt, Mr. <hi>Swingburn,</hi> Bachelor of the Civil Law, tells us, <hi>That an unſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Marriage, is not therefore no Marriage, becauſe it is unſolemn, the Banes perhaps not being publiſhed, or the Marriage being not celebrated in the Face of the Church, but privately in a Chamber, or ſome other Rite or Ceremony being omitted; but it is nevertheleſs reputed for true Marriage, both in the Eccleſiaſtical Courts in reſpect of the Eſſence or Knot of Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and in Temporal Courts in reſpect of the Wives Dowry, and other Legal Effects.</hi> Treat. of laſt <hi>Will,</hi> p. 20, 21.</p>

And ſo rational and neceſſary it is, that the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies appointed either by the Papiſts or others, ſhould not be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to belong at all to the eſſence of Marriage, that <hi>Durandus,</hi> an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Papiſt, tells us, as he is quoted by Dr. <hi>Willit, That there is neither any outward Holy Sign, nor</hi> [no Miniſter] <hi>neceſſary in Matrimony beſides the Parties;</hi> for, ſaith he, <hi>Matrimony may be ſolemnized by a Proctor between Parties that are abſent.</hi> So then the Preſence of a Prieſt is not of the Eſſence of Marriage, ſeeing it may be celebrated without them.</p>
               <p>And which is yet more; <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> that ſo much rennowed <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> is alledged by the ſaid Dr. <hi>Willit,</hi> ſaying, <hi>That Marriage being of the Nature of Contracts, the Parties themſelves ſuffice, and that it may be done in their Abſence.</hi> [meaning ſtill, that all Contracts be witneſſed.]</p>
               <p>And here the Words of Mr. <hi>Diodate</hi> are worthy of Remembrance upon <hi>Mal. 2. 15. Did not God in the beginning create</hi> Adam <hi>alone, out of whom he framed</hi> Eve <hi>to be his Wife, without creating any more Women for one Man, or more Men for one Woman? ſhewing thereby, that as he appointed Matrimony</hi> by one only Law [in which to be ſure there was no Ceremonies] <hi>of lawful Conjunction, it likewiſe ought to be one with one, and two in the ſame Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>From all which it is apparent that there may be lawful Marriage where there is no Ceremonies, much more without the Ceremonies of the Ring, and bowing at the Altar, and the Ceremonies are not therefore in any-wiſe to be made eſſential to Marriage, and that the Contract between two Perſons lawfully qualified for the State of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, and their actual taking each other into the Relation and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Husband and Wife, before ſufficient Witneſs, is eſſential, firm, and lawful Marriage, and conſequently that the Marriages made amongſt the baptized Believers are true Marriages in the Eye of the Law of this Land.</p>
               <p>And to make this yet more evident, I will conclude this Section with the united Authority of the late Lord Cheif Juſtice <hi>Hales,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> who fully expreſs themſelves for the Sufficiency of Marriages as made by the preſent Diſſenters. And thus the Doctor ſpeaks.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:110699:45"/>
                  <hi>He (that is, Judg</hi> Hale) <hi>was very cautious in declaring their Marriage void, and ſo baſtarding their Children. But be conſidered Marriage and Succeſſion as a right of Nature, from which none ought to be barred, what Miſtakes ſoever they might be under in the point of revealed Religion; and therefore in a Trial that was before him, when a Quaker was ſued for ſome Debts owing by his Wife before he married her; and the Quaker pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it was no Marriage that had paſt between them, ſince it was not ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemniz'd according to the Rules of the Church of</hi> England: <hi>He declared that he was not willing on his own Opinion to make their Children Baſtards, and gave Direction to the Jury to find it ſpecial, which they did.—He governed himſelf indeed</hi> (ſaith Dr. <hi>Burnet) by the Law of the Goſpel, of doing to others what he would have others do to him; and therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would have thought it a Hardſhip, not without Cruelty, if amongſt the Papiſts all Marriages were nulled, which had not been made with all the Ceremonies in the Roman Ritual, ſo he applying this to the caſe of the Secta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, he thought all Marriages made according to the ſeveral Perſwaſions of Men, ought to have their Effects in Law.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Of how great Value the Judgment of this worthy Man is in all Courts of Judicature, is alſo teſtified by this learned Doctor in theſe words; <hi>His Opinion in points of Law generally paſſes as an uncontroulable Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and is often pleaded in all the Courts of Juſtice.</hi> So that ſuch as out of a Fancy to ſome unneceſſary Ceremonies, would null all Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages amongſt Diſſenters, though made as publickly and ſolemnly as we can, and every way agreeable to the Law of God, and the Rules of Reaſon, will ſee themſelves concern'd we hope, to be better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed than to throw Dirt in the face of this great Patriot of the Law, as if he ſhould be a publick Defender of Whoredom; for ſo do ſome of our raſh Ceremonialiſts eſteem and ſpeak of all Marriages wherein their Ceremonies are omitted.</p>
               <p>Furthermore; If in this, or any other Nation, God's Ordinances ſhould become, or be reputed to be Nullities; when in the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, the Ceremonies appointed by the Church (or thoſe that call themſelves ſo) are omitted, there could be little cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of a right or effectual enjoyment of any of them: For Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, Confirmation, the Lord's Table, Ordination, Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion (and what not) as well as Marriage, has been, and is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred with ſo many of the Ceremonies of Mens deviſing, that it's not eaſy to number them, much leſs to obſerve them. But yet ſuch has been the Wiſdom of the greateſt Ceremonialiſts, as to be afraid to annual an Ordinance, tho the Ceremonies of the Church were omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:110699:46"/>
and particularly in the Caſe of Baptiſm, Ordination, and Marriages. Do not the Proteſtants allow of all theſe among the Papiſts, though many Ceremonies be uſed therein which they diſſallow? Yea, there is no doubt but both the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> would admit the Baptiſm of our Children for a valid Baptiſm, which was performed upon their perſonal profeſſion of Faith and Repentance, and by Immerſion, and by one whom they eſteem a Lay-man, becauſe nothing is wanting in our Baptiſm which pertains to the eſſence of the Ordinance, though we reject all their Rites, <hi>Sponſors, Croſſings,</hi> &amp;c. And therefore by a parity of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, our Marriages being warranted by God's Law in all things eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to Marriage, muſt be allowed good and honeſt Marriages, tho no Prieſt nor Ring, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was concern'd in them.</p>
               <p>I ſay again, Does not the Church of <hi>England</hi> hold the Ordination received in the Papacy to be valid? and yet they condemn ſome Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies which they uſe in their Ordinations for ſuperſtitious Vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; neither do they marry thoſe Papiſts a ſecond time who become Proteſtants, but do account their Marriages valid and good; and yet their Marriages were not celebrated according to the Rites of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> not by their Miniſters. And why? Surely becauſe neither the Law of God, nor the Law of the Land, do ſay they are null or void. And then ſure I am, if they will be but as kind to us as to Papiſts, they muſt grant our Marriages to be more juſtifiable of the two. For, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ours is no where condemned by the Law of God, nor the Law of the Land, any more than theirs. And, 2. we bring not in any Roman Rites in the Celebration of our Marriages, as perhaps they do in theirs; but we keep as near the Law of the Land in the Celebration of Marriage as we can, and do undoubtedly keep to the Law of God and right Reaſon therein, as much as any, as has been ſhewed.</p>

                  <hi>SECT. III. Of the moſt important Queſtion touching the caſe depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> viz. Whether it be neceſſary that Marriages ſhould be celebrated by a Miniſter? and whether they may be valid and lawful without them?</head>
               <p>THis is the Queſtion propounded by that learned and worthy Man Bp. <hi>Hall,</hi> in his Book of <hi>Reſolut.</hi> p. 361. <hi>c.</hi> 8. whoſe Anſwer will greatly ſtrengthen that which we have ſaid reſpecting the Law of God, for thus he ſpeaks:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>It is no marvel</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>(which hold Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony a Sacrament, conferring Grace by the very Work wrought) require an abſolute Neceſſity of the Prieſts hand in ſo holy an Act: but for us who (though reverently eſteeming that ſacred Inſtitution, yet) ſet it a Key lower, it admits of too much Queſtion, whether we need to ſtand upon the terms of a Miniſters Agency in the Performance of that ſolemn Action?</hi> So then it is a clear caſe it ſeems, unleſs we fall back to the Papiſts to make Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age a Sacrament, there is no abſolute Neceſſity to have a Prieſt to cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brate Marriage, and conſequently it may be done lawfully (by God's Law at leaſt) without them. And aſſuredly that Doctrine which makes a Miniſter of God abſolutely neceſſary to the Celebration of Marriages can in no wiſe be true, becauſe it is moſt unreaſonable to impeach all thoſe Marriages which all the World over, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to this day, have been celebrated without them: If then all Nations have all things that are eſſential to Marriage, and yet few Nations have had God's faithful Miniſters to celebrate it, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt there may be lawful Marriages without a Miniſter in all Nations, ſeeing the Eſſentials of Marriage is the ſame in all Nations.</p>
               <p>But though the Biſhop be for us thus far, yet he ſeems to be againſt us in that which follows, for thus he writes; <hi>That as it is requiſite (even according to the Roman Conſtitutions) that he who is entruſted with the cure of our Souls, ſhould beſides other Witneſſes be both preſent and active in, and at our domeſtick Contracts of Matrimony; ſo by the Laws both of our Church and Kingdom, it is neceſſary he ſhould have his hand in the publick Celebration of them; there may then be firm Contracts, there cannot be lawful Mariages without Gods Miniſters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:110699:47"/>But (reſerving the Honour due to ſo grave a Writer) I muſt anſwer thus; 1. If there may be firm Contracts without a Prieſt, that is, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts made with conſent of Parents, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and before ſufficient Witneſſes, and firm, that is, ſuch Contracts as cannot lawfully be broken (and leſs than ſuch he cannot mean); then I ſee not but that the Subſtance, or all that is eſſential to Marriage may be atained without the Prieſts hand, even in the Judgment of this learned Biſhop. But 2. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer further, that by the Teſtimonies of divers learned Men, both in the Roman Conſtitutions, and the Law of this Land, which we have alledged in the former <hi>Section;</hi> the Biſhop is miſtaken when he ſays the Law of this Kingdom does make the Prieſts hand ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that Marriage cannot be lawful without them. Sure <hi>Judg Hale</hi> underſtood the Law of the Kingdom, yet he thought <hi>all Marriages made according to the ſeveral Perſwaſions of Men, ought to have their Effects in Law:</hi> and indeed ſhould it be otherwiſe, that the Papiſts and other Diſſenters ſhould have their Marriages nulled, which were not celebrated by a Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> it would cauſe great Confuſion in the Land: and again they muſt all be prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited Marriage, who are unmarried among the Diſſenters, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated by the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for they pretend they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor lawfully marry Perſons excommunicated; and how any Church comes to aſſume Power to make ſuch Laws, we cannot underſtand; only of this we are ſure, neither the Law of God nor Reaſon (the prime Foundation of all good Laws) does warrant any Church in ſo doing.</p>
               <p>The Proof which the Biſhop ſeems moſt to reſt upon as the Strength of his Opinion, is, <hi>becauſe Chriſtians do know Matrimony to be an Holy Inſtitution of God himſelf, which he not only ordained, but actually cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated betwixt the firſt annocent Pair, and which being for the Propagation of an Holy Seed, requires a ſpecial Benediction; and how can we think any Man meet for this Office but the Man of God ſet over us in the Lord?</hi> But ſure theſe Premiſſes are not at all apt to bear this Concluſion, <hi>that none but a Prieſt may celebrate Marriage.</hi> The Argument ſeems more naturally to be deduced thus: <hi>God the Father of</hi> Adam, <hi>(Luke 3. ult.) who alſo had the right to diſpoſe of the Woman, and to give her in Marriage, did celebrate Marriage between</hi> Adam <hi>and</hi> Eve. <hi>Ergo, The Father, or thoſe who have right to diſpoſe of the Parties to be married, may lawfully celebrate the Marriage, and pray for a ſpecial Benediction;</hi> ſee 1 Cor. 7. 38. And for this we have ſome light from the Word of God in other places (as has been ſhewed): but that God's Miniſters were either in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:110699:47"/>
the time of the Law, or of the Goſpel, concern'd (as God's Miniſters) to celebrate Marriages, does not appear from any hint in the Word of God. And certainly had the Apoſtle been of this Biſhop's mind, he would have given us Direction either by his own Practice, or ſome other way, touching this matter; but that any of the Apoſtles ever married any body, will never be proved: And though Jeſus was at a Wedding and wrought a Miracle there, <hi>John</hi> 2. yet neither he nor any of his Diſciples did celebrate the Marriage, and then why may we not in reaſon think Marriage may be lawfully celebrated without a Prieſt? We may be ſure that thoſe who called Chriſt and his Diſciples to this Marriage, were ſuch as had a love to him, and being in <hi>Galilee,</hi> the place where he had been converſant, and where alſo his manner was to perform publick Miniſterial Acts (<hi>Luke</hi> 4. 14, 16.) the Perſons to be married, or their Relations, would as ſoon have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired his Aſſiſtance in the Celebration of their Marriage, as any other Miniſter: but the Truth is, neither he, nor any of the Prieſts were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploied in that matter that we read of: And hence we may well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude there can be no neceſſity to have Marriage celebrated with a Prieſt; and then it may lawfully be done without them. And though we grant a Miniſter may be as fit, and perhaps more fit than another Chriſtian, to give good Counſel to, and pray for the new-married Couple, yet it is apparent the Text, which the Biſhop ſeems<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to alledg to that purpoſe, intends no ſuch thing at all, as the place being read, will fully demonſtrate, 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 39. The Wife is bound by the Law as long as her Husband liveth: but if her Husband be dead, ſhe is at Liberty to be married to whom ſhe will, only in the Lord.</hi> Now the Biſhop infers thus; <hi>If all our Marriages muſt be (according to the Apoſtle's charge) made in the Lord, who ſo meet to pronounce God's Ratification of our Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages, as he who is the profeſt Herald of the Almighty?</hi> But the Apoſtle does not at all ſpeak of the Perſon that muſt celebrate Marriage, but of the Perſon with whom a Chriſtian may lawfully marry, as <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date</hi> and others do fitly expound the place. And though we yield willingly that a Man of God is a fit Perſon to declare God's Will and Authority in the Ratification of our Marriages, yet it follows not at all, that none but a Man of God may be fit to do this, or that none may lawfully do it but a Herald of the Almighty. But what needs many words? The Biſhop anſwers the Queſtion, where he tells us, that though the Papiſts make it abſolutely neceſſary to have a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter's hand in the act of Marriage, yet the Proteſtants <hi>ſet it a Key lower;</hi> and confeſſes that <hi>it admits of too much queſtion, whether we</hi>
                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:110699:48"/>
                  <hi>need to ſtand upon the terms of a Miniſter's Agency in the Performance of that ſolemn Action.</hi> So then this ſolemn Action of Marriage may be done without a Miniſter's Agency; therefore there may be lawful Marriages without God's Miniſters: this being granted, we acknowledg it very commendable to have them preſent, if they may be obtained.</p>
               <p>But now it would be conſidered, whether the Perſons to be married may not lawfully be ſatisfied that the Perſon whom they imploy in the Celebration of their Marriage, is in their Judgment a lawful Miniſter, or Man of God (ſuppoſing it neceſſary to have ſuch a Man to do the Buſineſs.) This ſeems rational, and if ſo, I doubt there will be a great difficulty in the caſe. And to be plain, though we could admit very willingly of the Prayer of a ſober and pious Miniſter of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Buſineſs of our Nuptials<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet, when we are required to kneel before one whom we know to be a wicked drunken Perſon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how ſhould we act Faith in his Prayer, when God himſelf tells us, <hi>The Prayers of the Wicked are an Abomination to him?</hi> We may not ſafely conform to ſuch things though the Laws of Men do require it. And indeed the Biſhop ſeems to favour us in ſuch a ſtrait as this: for he ſaith, <hi>The Laws of Men do not, ought not, cannot bind your Conſciences as of themſelves; but if they be juſt, they bind you in Conſcience to Obedience.</hi> Now to this we do moſt heartily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe, only deſiring we may have leave to conſider what is juſt or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt in this caſe, and then we doubt not of our Duty to obey actively what the Law juſtly requires, or elſe to ſuffer patiently what it impoſes.</p>
               <p>Now though we can find no ground to believe that to celebrate Marriage is a miniſterial act (though a Miniſter may do it) yet we do not refuſe the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> becauſe ſuch, but becauſe they will not ratify our Contracts unleſs we conform to ſuch things as ſeem to us to be ſinful (as we ſhall ſhew in the next Section.) And if it were a work peculiar to God's Miniſters, our Straits in coming to the Prieſts would be greater than they are, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we know God does not allow wicked Men to take his Word into their Mouths, ſpecially when they hate to be reformed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 16. And beſides, we believe and know, we have of thoſe that more fully agree with us in matters of Religion, that are Miniſters of Chriſt. And therefore were Marriage (in the Celebration of it) a Miniſterial Work, we ſhould not fail to have it rightly done by them; but this is not our Perſwaſion: though we think as reverently of this Ordinance as any, yet we believe it moſt fit to be teſtified before thoſe who are appointed by the Laws of the Land, and therefore do
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:110699:48"/>
what with a good Conſcience we can to have it ſo, but being reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as we have ſhewed) we know our Marriages are not therefore null; becauſe we have all that is eſſential to lawful Marriage, both in the Eye of the Law of God, and the Law of the Land alſo. For the firſt, this Learned Prelate does not deny, whilſt <hi>he makes not a Miniſter abſolutely neceſſary to the Celebration of Marriage.</hi> And the Learned Judg <hi>Hale</hi> grants the ſecond, <hi>that our Marriages ought to have their Effects in Law.</hi> And <hi>Durand</hi> (a Man well skill'd in the Roman Conſtitutions) tells us, <hi>There is no holy Sign, nor no Miniſter neceſſary in Matrimony, &amp;c.</hi> as we have ſhewed. And beſides this, it is fully ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this learned Biſhop, that many Chriſtians in all Ages have done, and may lawfully do ſome things, tho they be <hi>Lay-men,</hi> which are moſt fitly to be done by ſuch as have a Miniſterial Authority thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, namely, to <hi>catechiſe, defend and propagate the Goſpel.</hi> Such were <hi>Origen, Ariſtides, Hegeſippus, Juſtin,</hi> and many others; ſee his Book of <hi>Reſolut. p. 265. chap.</hi> 10. Thoſe who called themſelves Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks in <hi>Auguſtin</hi>'s time, did allow the Baptiſm and other ſacred Acts of the <hi>Donatiſts, &amp;c.</hi> to be valid. It is ſtrange then that the Marria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of the preſent Diſſenters ſhould be made Nullities by the common Proteſtants; who themſelves are eſteemed but Diſſenters in a Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Nation, and therefore their Marriages are as liable to cenſure there as ours are here; but theſe are Hardſhips and Cruelties in the Opinion of that learned Lawyer, the late Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Hale.</hi>

               <p>Now this uſe of the Ring amongſt the Papiſts is condemned by this Learned Doctor of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> for a <hi>ſuperſtitious Toy,</hi> partly for that it muſt be <hi>hallowed by the Prieſt;</hi> and partly for that the Man holding the <hi>Woman by the Ring, their Fingers a-croſs, ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanting words,</hi> ſays he, <hi>are then muttered;</hi> but the words he ſets not down.</p>
               <p>And now becauſe the uſe of the <hi>Ring</hi> in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>the kneeling at the Altar, and to the Prieſt for his Bleſſing,</hi> are very doubtful to us, we ſhall here take a view of the matter. And,</p>

                  <item>1. The Ring muſt be laid upon the Service-Book.</item>

               <p>Now theſe things, ſo far as we are able to underſtand them, do look as much like Superſtition, as any thing which the Proteſtant Doctor has to object againſt the Popiſh uſe of the Ring: For why muſt the Ring be laid upon the Service-Book, and ſo paſs through

Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the Ring is hereby ſuppoſed to be made more fit to wed the Woman; and this it cannot be, unleſs it be ſuppoſed to be ſanctified, or if there be nothing of all this, it ſeems to be wholly ſuperfluous.</p>
               <p>And for the Man to ſay he weds her (whom he has married ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently before) with that Ring, in the <hi>Name of the Father,</hi> &amp;c. is ſo like a Sacramental form of Words, as that we are ſure none more ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn are appointed to be uſed in Holy Baptiſm: nor can any higher form of Words be deviſed. Had Almighty God appointed this form of Words to be annexed to the uſe of a <hi>Ring,</hi> all Men would and ſurely might have concluded Marriage among Chriſtians to be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament as well as Baptiſm: but ſeeing he hath not done it, it ſeems to us too bold an attempt; for any Church to impoſe ſuch a Rite or Ceremony in ſo great a Name, and therefore in Conſcience we dare not conform to the Church of <hi>England</hi> in this thing; for it is dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous <hi>to ſpeak a Word,</hi> much more to make an Inſtitute, <hi>in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, which he hath not commanded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us conſider whence the Ring in Marriage was derived, that we may the better judg of the matter. 1. Then it is reckoned among the Heathen Roman Rites in their Marriages, and the manner thus; <hi>The Man gave in token of good Will</hi> (they ſay) <hi>a Ring unto the Woman, which ſhe was to wear upon the next Finger to the little Finger on the left Hand, becauſe unto that Finger alone proceeded a certain Artery from the Heart:</hi> Here ſeems to be the Radix or Spring of the Ring in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, unleſs perhaps it might be before this among the ſuperſtitious Jews; for thus we read,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Wedding-Ring among the Jews had this Inſcription,</hi> MAZAL TOB, [which the Learned ſay, is to wiſh good luck] <hi>and it was given to the Bride-wife: and the Hebrews called the Planet</hi> Jupiter Mazal, <hi>whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence they thought to be of great force for Generation.</hi> Godwin. Antiq. of the Rom. and Jews.</p>
               <p>Now which of theſe ſoever was the Spring-Head, though there ſeems to be ſomething of Superſtition or Folly in the Buſineſs, yet I think an impartial Man muſt needs ſay the Ring has attracted more of that kind among the Chriſtian Nations, than it had among the Jews or Heathens. The ſhort is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Were the Ring uſed only as a Civil Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, without this ſeemingly ſacred Solemnity, we ſhould ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. But for Chriſtians to adopt either the Heathen or Jewiſh ſuperſtitious Rites into the Service of the Church, and to make the Celebration of them miniſterial Acts, is the Buſineſs for the ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and thinking Chriſtian to conſider.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="90" facs="tcp:110699:50"/>And aſſuredly till it turn to the Lord to encline the Hearts of his People with one accord, to reſtore his Holy Ordinances (and amongſt the reſt this of Marriage) to their Native Purity and Simplicity, there will be continual cauſe of Sorrow, Diſcontents and Animoſities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Chriſtians, and occaſion thereby given in all Chriſtian Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the more Carnal and Ceremonious, to perſecute the more ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and ſerious ſort of Chriſtians. And the grave Author of the the firſt part of the naked Truth (not that of Mr. <hi>H.</hi>) makes thoſe without doubt to be always the weakeſt and moſt carnal, who ſtand ſo much for Ceremonies; and ſpeaking of the <hi>Ring,</hi> he makes it (in reſpect of himſelf) as a thing of meer Indifferency, to be married with or without it. And were it left to that Liberty, we ſhould not much complain; but alas 'tis made ſo neceſſary that we cannot be married by a Prieſt without it.</p>
               <p>2. We cannot underſtand how to worſhip our Wives, yet we can underſtand St. <hi>Paul,</hi> where he bids us <hi>give them Honour as the weaker Veſſel. To worſhip any Creature in the Name of the Father, Son, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt,</hi> is very ſuſpicious; but I ſay, to worſhip our Wives thus, is a thing we underſtand not. This ſeems to be borrowed from the forementioned Jews, who had <hi>Jupiter</hi> in ſuch eſteem: For the ſame Antiqueriſt tell us, that the Words of their Dowry-Bill ran thus, <hi>Be thou unto me a Wife according to the Law of</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Word of God will worſhip, honour, maintain and govern thee,</hi> &amp;c. But where the Word of God obliges a Man to worſhip his Wife, is yet unrevealed to us. There is indeed a Civil Worſhip due to our Superiours, or Perſons of great Worth, <hi>Luke</hi> 14. 12. But the Law of God and Nature has made the Man ſuperiour in Marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, and why are we to unman our ſelves to gratify a Ceremony?</p>
               <p>In all that I have written I deſign nothing againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> whom I unfainedly honour, as I do all that heartily love Jeſus Chriſt, as Charity commands me to believe ſhe doth; yet let me freely ſay, that the Sign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> in Baptiſm (though certainly an Errour, becauſe added to a ſacred Inſtitute of Chriſt, without any Allowance from his Word, yet) is much more excuſable than this Sign of the <hi>Ring.</hi> For if we conſider their Original, the <hi>Croſs</hi> was uſed in Defence of his Honour who died upon a Croſs, and in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the Blaſphemy both of Jews and Heathens. But the <hi>Ring</hi> was borrowed from the ſuperſtitious Rites both of Jews and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, and ſo more unfit for any Service among Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:110699:50"/>Again, The Croſs is not ſo highly honoured in Baptiſm, as the Ring is in Marriage; for the Croſs is not made or uſed in the Name of the Trinity, as we ſee the Ring is. Moreover, the Sign of the <hi>Croſs</hi> may be omitted ſometimes, even by the Laws of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> (as in private Baptiſm) but the Ring is not ſo. That Baptiſm is not doubted to be valid, which wants only the Sign of the Croſs, but (according to ſome of our preſent Clergy) the Ring muſt be one, or elſe they will not celebrate Marriage, and if it be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Ring, will almoſt condemn it for no Marriage at all. But ſure it is not in the Power of any Church to make Laws, Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Rites or Ceremonies, ſo neceſſary to this Ordinance of God (I mean Marriage) as that the Omiſſion of them ſhould null God's Ordinance, or put a Bar againſt Mens having the Benefit of that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diaance, which both the Law of God and Nature allows them.</p>
               <p>Hath not the Church often been not only the leaſt, but alſo a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted People in a Nation, and may be ſo again; how then can it pertain to her to make Laws in caſes which concern Men as Men, and all Men in a Nation as much as any? and in which ſhe is bound to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Laws of theſe Nations (ſo far as ſhe may do it without Sin) rather than preſcribe (<hi>unleſs to teach the Law of God to them</hi>) what ceremonies they muſt uſe in their Nuptial Celebrations.</p>
               <p>But foraſmuch as Marriages are the Foundation of Families, and that upon the Legality whereof the Good of Poſterity does much depend, we therefore conclude, this univerſal Ordinance of God is under the Cognizance of the Magiſtrate, whoſe care is to ſee that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing be done herein againſt the Law of God, right Reaſon and common Honeſty, but that all Violation of theſe rules of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be corrected, and the contrary encouraged. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we chearfully ſubmit our ſelves to their Majeſties, and to all that are in Authority as in Duty bound, moſt humbly intreating that ſome prudent care may be taken by our Superiours that whatſoever is grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious herein may be removed.</p>
