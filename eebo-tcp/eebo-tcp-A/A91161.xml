            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>If he conceit, the <hi>Noblenes</hi> of his blood may apologize for his impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity;
though he hath forfeited it in this ignoble action: all underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
men will conclude, that as it aggravates his guilt, and heightens
his offence; ſo it pleads moſt effectually for his execution: ſince an
exemplary Preſident of juſtice upon an eminent offender of Noble ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,
will ſtrike more terror into, and doe more good upon other
Governors, then twenty Lawes, or a thouſand executions of inferiour
perſons, for ſleighter offences; And ſeeing he hath given the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Kingdome incomparably the moſt fatall blow, and the enemy
the richeſt booty they ever yet received, in the loſſe of <hi>Briſtoll;</hi> there is
little reaſon or juſtice, that hee ſhould eſcape after ſuch a publique
triall, and judgement of his owne ſeeking; the beſt ſervice he can now
doe for the Common wealth, being this<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to become a ſpectacle and
Monument of publike Iuſtice to Poſterity in a military way, as <hi>Strafford</hi>

               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:159144:4"/>
who was condemned and loſt his head with two of his Captains in
the yeare 1587. by the Earle of <hi>Leiceſter</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> direction,
notwithſtanding the Nobility and greatnes of his family, the powerfull
mediation of his friends, and the confeſſion of his Errors, with promiſe
to expiate it by ſerving the Queen by Land or Sea at his own charges,
onely for ſurrendring the Town of <hi>Graue,</hi> (of far leſſe conſequence and
ſtrength then <hi>Briſtol</hi>) to the <hi>potent enemy,</hi> after full 3. months (not 3. daies)
ſiege, and that upon honourable termes punctually obſerved, (the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
marching out with their arms and baggage, and the Citizens with
their goods) and that when the walls of it with many batteries of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non
were levelled to the ground, and the town threatned with a preſent
generall aſſault, which made moſt of the Souldiers and Inhabitants to
importune him upon their knees with teares, to parly with the Enemy,
and to yeeld the Towne upon good conditions. This ſentence and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
was thought over-ſevere by ſome, but the Earle of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> and
the wiſeſt men deemed it neceſſary to reforme the ancient neglects of
military diſcipline then much decayed; and to preſerve other Forts
from over-ſudden ſurrenders before utmoſt extremity: and the wiſeſt
Stateſmen, ſouldiers have affirmed, that the loſſe of this great mans head
was more advantagious to the States in regard of the Preſident, then the
ſaving of his, or a thouſand mens lives of his ranke, in ſuch a caſe could
be. The ſtory needs no application: he who will not adventure his life,
to defend his charge, and a place of ſuch importance as <hi>Briſtoll</hi> for the
Kingdomes ſafety, and keeping out of the <hi>Iriſh Rebels,</hi> now actually poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
of it, deſerves at leaſt to loſe his head for ſuch a <hi>Cowardize,</hi> and
cannot doe the Kingdome greater ſervice, nor Juſtice more Right, then
to ſuffer for it, and become a Preſident for the benefit of Poſterity,
eſpecially when he growes ſo obſtinatly perverſe as neither to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
nor lament his Error.</p>
