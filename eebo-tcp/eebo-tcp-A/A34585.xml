            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>My Hopes are built upon his Mortal foe:</l>
                  <l>When the Rude people of this barbarous Town,</l>
                  <l>Made the Late King desert his Royal Throne,</l>
                  <l>His Native Soil he left, in hope to find</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Rome</hi>'s Senate to their old Confederate kind;</l>
                  <l>To move their Pity we both went along,</l>
                  <l>You but a tender Child, my self though Young</l>
                  <l>Yet of an Age to make that Beauty known</l>
                  <l>Which Heav'n had lent me, and some Hearts my own;</l>
                  <l>Above the rest <hi>Caesar</hi> his Passion shows,</l>
                  <l>Declares his Love, but yet with Caution wooes;</l>
                  <l>Fearing the Senate, he puts <hi>Pompey</hi> on,</l>
                  <l>Our bus'ness was by their new friendship done;</l>
                  <l>
                     <hi>Pompey</hi>'s Authority for his Sake we had,</l>
                  <l>And you this way with Royal Robes are clad.</l>
                  <l>But <hi>Caesar</hi> thus to gain us mighty <hi>Rome,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>Thought not enough, his Love persues us home,</l>
                  <l>His Purse as well as Heart he open'd wide,</l>
                  <l>And with his Treasure our Low state supply'd;</l>
                  <l>His thousand Talents which are yet unpaid,</l>
                  <l>Over the Rebells us Victorious made,</l>
                  <l>This knew our Dying Father, and bestow'd</l>
                  <l>Half that on me to whom the Whole he ow'd,</l>
                  <l>He knew the Kingdome was my Beauties prize,</l>
                  <l>And that he ow'd his Scepter to these Eyes;</l>
                  <l>Betwixt us two by his last Will, the Land</l>
                  <l>Restor'd by <hi>Caesar</hi> does Divided stand;</l>
                  <l>And thus you see it is no Partial end,</l>

                  <l>Head-long we might to Death and Danger run,</l>

                  <l>Since <hi>Cleopatra</hi> I could not Obey?</l>
                  <l>Not justly me, but Heav'n you must accuse,</l>
                  <l>Which to the Guilty pardon does refuge,</l>
