            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>An account of the Growth of POPERY, and Arbitrary Government in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here has now for diverse Years, a design been carried on, to change the Lawfull Government of <hi>England</hi> into an Absolute Tyranny, and to convert the established Protestant Religion into down-right Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery: than both which, nothing can be more destructive or contrary to the Interest and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to the Constitution and Being of the King and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.</p>
            <p>For if first we consider the State, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> Rule not upon the same terms with those of our neighbour Nations, who, having by force or by adresse usurped that due share which their People had in the Government, are now for some Ages in possession of an Arbitrary Power (which yet no Presciption can make Legall) and exercise it over their persons and estates in a most Tyrannical man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. But here the Subjects retain their proportion in the Legislature; the very meanest Commoner of <hi>England</hi> is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented in <hi>Parliament,</hi> and is a party to those Laws by which the Prince is sworn to Govern himself and his people.
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:60385:3"/>
No Mony is to be levied but by the common consent. No than is for Life, Limb, Goods, or Liberty at the Soveraigns discretion: but we have the same Right (modestly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood) in our Propriety that the Prince hath in his Regality; and in all Cases where the King is concerned, we have our just remedy as against any private person of the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, in the Courts of <hi>Westminster</hi> Hall or in the High Court of <hi>Parliament.</hi> His very Prerogative is no more then what the Law has determined. His Broad Seal, which is the Legitimate stamp of his pleasure, yet is no longer cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, than upon the Trial it is found to be Legal. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not commit any person by his particular warrant. He can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not himself be witnesse in any cause: the Ballance of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Justice being so dellicate, that not the hand only but even the breath of the Prince would turn the scale. Nothing is left to the Kings will, but all is subjected to his Authority: by which means it follows that he can do no wrong, nor can he receive wrong; and a King of <hi>England,</hi> keeping to these measures, may without arrogance be said to remain the onely Intelligent Ruler over a Rational People. In recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense therefore and acknowledgment of so good a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment under his influence, his Person is most sacred and inviolable; and whatsoever excesses are committed against so high a trust, nothing of them is imputed to him, as being free from the necessity or temptation, but his Ministers on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are accountable for all and must answer it at their perills. He hath a vast Revenue constantly arising from the Hearth of the Housholder, the Sweat of the Laboures, the Rent of the Farmer, the Industry of the Merchant, and consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly out of the Estate of the Gentleman: a larg competence to defray the ordinary expense of the Crown, and maintain its lustre. And if any extraordinary occasion happen, or be but with any probable decency pretended, the whole Land at whatsoever season of the year does yield him a plentifull Harvest. So forward are his Peoples affections to give even
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:60385:3"/>
to superfluity, that a Forainer (or English man that hath been long abroad) would think they could neither will nor chuse, but that the asking of a supply, were a meer formality, it is so readily granted. He is the Fountain of all Honours, and has moreover the distribution of so many profitable Offices of the Houshold, of the Revenue, of State, of Law, of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, of the Navy (and, since his persent <hi>Majesties</hi> time, of the Army) that it seems as if the Nation could scarse furnish honest men enow to supply all those imployments. So that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are in nothing inferiour to other Princes, save in being more abridged from injuring their own subjects: But have as large a field as any of external feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, wherein to exercise their own Virtue and so reward and incourage it in others. In short, there is nothing that comes nearer in Government to the Divine Perfection, then where the Monarch, as with us, injoys a capacity of doing all the good imaginable to mankind, under a disability to all that is evil.</p>
            <p>And as we are thus happy in the Constitution of our State, so are we yet more blessed in that of our Church; being free from that <hi>Romish</hi> Yoak, which so great a part of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome do yet draw and labour under, That Popery is such a thing as cannot, but for want of a word to express it, be called a Religion: nor is it to be mentioned with that civility which is otherwise decent to be used, in speaking of the differences of humane opinion about Divine Matters. Were it either open Judaisine, or plain Turkery, or honest Paganisme, there is yet a certain <hi>Bona fides</hi> in the most extravagant Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and the sincerity of an erroneous Profession may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it more pardonable: but this is a compound of all the three, an extract of whatsoever is most ridiculous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious in them, incorporated with more peculiar absurdityes of its own, in which those were deficient; and all this delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately contrived, knowingly carried on by the bold im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posture of Priests under the name of Christianity. The wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of this fifth Religion, this last and insolentest attempt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:60385:4"/>
uppon the credulity of mankind seems to me (though not ignorant otherwise of the times, degrees and methods of its progresse) principally to have consisted in their owning the Scriptures to be the word of God, and the Rule of Faith and Manners, but in prohibiting of the same time their common use, or the reading of them in publick Churches but in a <hi>Latine</hi> translation to the vulgar: there being no better or more rational way to frustrate the very design of the great Institutor of Christianity, who first planted it by the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary gift of Tongues, then to forbid the use even of the ordinary languages. For having thus a book which is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versally avowed to be of Divine Authority, but sequestring it only into such hands as were intrusted in the cheat, they had the opportunity to vitiate, suppresse, or interpret to their own profit those Records by which the poor People hold their salvation. And this necessary point being once gained, there was thence forward nothing so monstrous to reason, so abhorring from morality, or so contrary to scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which they might not in prudence adventure on. The Idolatry (for alas it is neither better nor worse) of adoring and praying to Saints and Angels, of worshipping Pictures, Images and Reliques, Incredible Miracles and plapable Fables to promote that veneration. The whole Liturgy and Worship of the Blessed Virgin. The saying of <hi>Pater Nosters</hi> and Creeds, to the honour of Saints, and of <hi>Ave Mary's</hi> too, not to her honour, but of others. The Publick Service, which they can spare to God among so many competitors, in an unknown tongue; and intangled with such Vestments, Consecrations, Exorcismes, Whisperings, Sprinklings, Censings, and Phantasticall Rites, Gesticulations, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>movals, so unbeseeming a Christian Office, that it represents rather the pranks and ceremonyes of Juglers and Conjurers. The Refusal of the Cup to the Laity. The necessity of the Priests Intention to make any of their Sacraments effectual. Debarring their Clergy from Marriage. Interdicting of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:60385:4"/>
Meats. Auricular Confession and Absolution, as with them practised. Penances, Pilgrimages, Purgatory, and Prayer for the dead. But above all their other devices, that Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>substantiall solacisme, whereby that glorified Body, which at the same time they allow to be in Heaven, is sold again and crucifyed daily upon all the Altars of their Communion. For God indeed may now and then do a Miracle, but a Romish Priest can, it seems, work in one moment a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand Impossibilityes. Thus by a new and antiscriptural Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, compiled of Terrours to the Phansy, Contradictions to Sense, and Impositions on the Understanding, their Laity have turned Tenants for their Souls, and in consequence Tributary for their Estates to a more then omnipotent Priesthood.</p>
            <p>I must indeed do them that right to avow that, out of an equitable consideration and recompense of so faithfull a slavery, they have discharged the People from all other services and dependance, infranchised them from all duty to God or Man; insomuch that their severer and more learned Divines, their Governors of Conscience, have so wel instruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in all the arts of Circumventing their neighbour, and of colluding with Heaven, that, wear the scholars as apt as their teachers, their would have been long since an end of all either true Piety, or common Honesty; and nothing left among them but authorized Hypocrisy, Licentiousnesse and Knavery; had not the naturall worth of the better sort, and the Good simplicity of the meaner, in great measure pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferved them. For nothing indeed but an extraordinary temper and ingenuity of spirit, and that too assisted by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viner influence, could possibly restrain those within any the termes or Laws of humanity, who at the same time own the Doctrine of their Casuists or the Authority of the Pope, as it is by him claimed and exercised. He by his Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences delivers soules out of the paines of the other world: So that who would refuse to be vicious here, upon so good
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:60385:5"/>
security. He by his dispensation annuls Contracts betwixt man and man, dissoves Oaths between Princes, or betwixt them and their People, and gives allowance in cases which God and nature prohibits. He, as Clerk of the spirituall Market, hath set a rate upon all crimes: the more flagitious they are and abominable, the better Commodities, and men pay onely an higher price as for greater rarityes. So that it seemes as if the commands of God had been invented meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to erect an Office for the Pope; the worse Christians men are, the better Customers; and this <hi>Rome</hi> does by the same policy people its Church, as the Pagan <hi>Rome</hi> did the City, by opening a sanctuary to all Malefactors. And why not, if his Power be indeed of such virtue and extent as is by him chalenged? That he is the Ruler over Angels, Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and Hell. That his Tribunal and Gods are all one. That all that God, he can do, <hi>Clave non errant,</hi> and what he does is as God and not as man. That he is the Universall Head of the Church, The sole Interpreter of Scripture, and Judge of Controversy. That <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> is above Generall Councils. That his Power is Absolute, and his Decrees In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible. That he can change the very nature of things, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is Just to be Unjust, and what is Vice to be Virtue. That all Laws are in the Cabinet of his Breast. That he can Dispence with the new Testment to the great injury of the Divels. That he is still Monarch of this World, and that he can dispose of Kingdoms and Empires as he pleases. Which things being granted, that stile of <hi>Optimum, Maximum &amp; supremum numen in terris,</hi> or that of <hi>Dominus, Deus noster, Papa,</hi> was no such extraordinary stroke of Courtship as we reckoned: but it was rather a great clownishness in him that treated so mighty a Prince under the simple Title of <hi>Vice-Deus.</hi> The exercise of his Dominion is in all points suitable to this his Pretence. He antiquates the precepts of <hi>Christ</hi> as things only of good advice, not commanded: but makes it a mortall seu even to doubt of any part of his own Religion,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:60385:5"/>
and demands under paine of damnation the subjection of all Christians to his Papal Authority: the denying of two things so reasonable as blind obedience to this Power, and an Implicite Faith to his Doctrine, being the most unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable crime, under his Dispensation. He has indeed of late been somewhat more retentive then formerly as to his faculty of disposing of Kingdomes, the thing not having succeeded well with him in some instances: but he layes the same claim still, continues the same inclination, and though velvet headed hath the more itch to be pushing. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever in order to any occasion he keeps himself in breath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways by cursing one Prince or other upon every Maunday Thusday: Nor is their any, whether Prince or Nation, that dissents from his Usurpations, but are marked out under the notion of <hi>Hereticks</hi> to ruine and destruction whensover he shall give the signal. That word of <hi>Heresy</hi> misapplyed, hath served him for so many Ages to Justify all the Executions, Assassinations, Warrs, Massacres, and Devastations, whereby his Faith hath been Propagated; of which our times also have not wanted examples, and more is to be expected for the future. For by how much any thing is more false and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonble, it requires more cruelty to establish it: and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce that which is absurd, there must be somwhat done that is barbarous. But nothing of any sect in Religion can be more recommended by all these qualityes then the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy. The <hi>Pagans</hi> are excusable by their natural darkness, without Revelation. The <hi>Jevvs</hi> are tolerable, who see not beyond the Old Testament. <hi>Mahomet</hi> was so honest as to own what he would be at, that he himself was the greatest Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, and that his was a Religion of the Sword. So that these were all, as I may say, of another Allegiance and if Enemys, yet not Traytors: But the Pope avowing Christianity by profession doth in Doctrine and practise renonce it: and presuming to be the only Catholick, does persecute those to
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:60385:6"/>
the death who dare worship the Author of their Religion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of his pretended Vicegerent.</p>
            <p>And yet there is nothing more evident, notwithstanding his most notorious forgeries and falsification of all Writers, then that the Pope was for severall Hundred of Years an honest Bishop as other men are, and never so much as dream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the Seven Hills of that universal power which he is now come to: nay was the first that opposed any such preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. But some of them at last, growing wiser, by foisting a counterfeit Donation of <hi>Constantine,</hi> and wresting another Donation from our Saviour, advanced themselves in a weak, ignorant, and credulous Age, to that Temporal and Spiritual Principality that they are now seised of. <hi>Tues Petrus, &amp; super hanc Petram, adificabo Ecclesiam meam.</hi> Never was a Bishop-prick and a Verse of Scripture so improved by good manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Thus, by exercising in the quality of Christs Uicar the publick function under an invisible Prince, the Pope, like the Maires of the Palace, hath set his master aside and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the Government over to a new Line of Papal Succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion. But who can, unlesse wilfully, be ignorant what wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed doings, what Bribery, what Ambition there are, how long the Church is without an Head upon every Vacancy, till among the crew of bandying Cardinalls the Holy Ghost have declared for a Pope of the <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Spanish</hi> Faction. It is a sucession like that of the <hi>Egyptian Ox</hi> (the living Idol of that Country) who dying or being made away by the Priests, there was a solemn and general mourning for want of a Deity; until in their Conclave they had found out another Beast with the very same marks as the former, whom then they themselvs adored and with great Jubilee brought forth to the People to worship. Nor was that Election a grosser reproach to human Reason then this is also to Christianity. Surely it is the greatest Miracle of the Romish Church that it should still continue, and that in all this time the Gates of Heaven should not prevaile against it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:60385:6"/>
It is almost unconceivable how Princes can yet suffer a Power so pernicious, and Doctrine so destructive to all Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. That so great a part of the Land should be ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enated and condemned to, as they call it, Pious Uses. That such millions of their People as the Clergy, should, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining unmarryed, either frustrate humane nature if they live chastly, or, if otherwise, adulterate it. That they should be priviledged from all labour, all publick service, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt from the power of all Secular Jurisdiction. That they, being all bound, by strict Oaths and Vows of Obedience to the <hi>Pope,</hi> should evacuate the Fealty due to the Soveraign. Nay, that not only the Clergy but their whole People, if of the <hi>Romish</hi> preswasion, should be obliged to rebel at any time upon the <hi>Popes</hi> pleasure. And yet how many of the Neighbouring Princes are content, or do chuse to reign, upon those conditions; which being so dishonorable and dangerous, surely some great and more weighty reason does cause them submit to. Whether it be out of personal fear, having heard perhaps of several attempts which the blind obedience of <hi>Popish Zelotes</hi> hath executed against their Princes. Or, whether aiming at a more absolute and tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Government, they think it still to be the case of <hi>Boni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> and <hi>Phocas</hi> (an usurping Emperour and an usurping Bishop) and that, as other Cheats, this also is best to be managed by Confederacy. But, as farre as I can appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, there is more of Sloth then Policy on the Princes side in this whole matter: and all that pretense of inslaving men by the assistance of Religion more easily, is neither more nor lesse then when the <hi>Bramine,</hi> by having the first night of the Bride assures himself of her devotion for the future, and makes her more fit for the husband.</p>
            <p>This reflection upon the state of our Neighbours, in aspect to Religion, doth sufficiently illustrate our happinesse, and spare me the labour of describing it further, then by the Rule of Contraryes: Our Church standing upon all points
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:60385:7"/>
in a direct opposition to all the forementioned errours. Our Doctrine being true to the Principles of the first Christian institution, and Episcopacy being formed upon the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Model, and no Ecclesiastical Power jostling the Civil, but all concurring in common obedience to the Soveraign. Nor therefore is their any, whether Prince or Nation, that can with less probability be reduced back to the <hi>Romish</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swasion, than ours of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For, if first we respect our Obedience to God, what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is there that, after so durable and general an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightning of our minds with the sacred Truth, we should a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain put out our own Eyes, to wander thorow the palpable darkness of that gross Superstition? But forasmuch as most men are less concern'd for their Interest in Heaven than on Earth, this seeming the nearer and more certain, on this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count also our alteration from the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> is the more impossible. When beside the common ill examples and consequences of <hi>Popery</hi> observable abroad, whereby. we might grow wise at the expense of our Neighbours, we cannot but reflect upon our own Experiments at home, which would make even fools docible. The whole Reign of <hi>Queen Mary,</hi> in which the <hi>Papists</hi> made Fewel of the <hi>Protestants.</hi> The Excommunicating and Deprivation of <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> by the <hi>Pope,</hi> pursued with so many Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons and attempts upon her Person, by her own Subjects, and the Invasion in <hi>Eighty-Eight</hi> by the <hi>Spanish.</hi> The two <hi>Breves</hi> of the <hi>Pope,</hi> in order to exclude King <hi>James</hi> from the Succession to the Crown, seconded by the <hi>Gunpovvder-Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son.</hi> In the time of his late Majesty, King <hi>Charles</hi> the first, (besides what they contributed to the Civil War in <hi>England)</hi> the Rebellion and horrid Massacre in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and, which was even worse than that, their pretending that it was done by the Kings Commission, and vouching the <hi>Broad Seal</hi> for their Authority. The <hi>Popes Nuncio</hi> assuming nevertheless and exercising there the Temporal as well as Spiritual Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:60385:7"/>
granting out Commissions under his own Hand, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Treatys of Peace between the King, and, as they then styled themselves, the <hi>Confederate Catholicks;</hi> heading two Armies against the <hi>Marquess</hi> of <hi>Ormond,</hi> then Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, and forcing him at last to quit the Kingdom: all which ended in the Ruine of his Majesties Reputation, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and Person; which but upon occasion of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, could never have happened. So that we may reckon the Reigns of our late Princes, by a succession of the <hi>Popish Treasons</hi> against them. And, if under his present Majesty we have as yet seen no more visible effects of the same spirit than the <hi>Firing</hi> of <hi>London</hi> (acted by <hi>Hubert,</hi> hired by <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delou</hi> two <hi>French-men)</hi> which remains a Controverfie, it is not to be attributed to the good nature or better Principles of that Sect, but to the wisdom of his <hi>Holyness;</hi> who observes that we are not of late so dangerous <hi>Protestants</hi> as to deserve any special mark of his Indignation, but that we may be made better use of to the weakning of those that are of our own Religion, and that if he do not disturbe us, there are those among our selves, that are leading us into a fair way of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation with him.</p>
            <p>But those continued fresh Instances, in relation to the Crown, together with the <hi>Popes</hi> claim of the Temporal and immediate Dominion of the Kingdoms of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> which he does so challenge, are a sufficient caution to the Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and of the People, there is as little hopes to seduce them, the <hi>Protestant Religion</hi> being so inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven as it is with their Secular Interest. For the Lands that were formerly given to superstitious uses, having first been applyed to the Publick Revenue, and afterwards by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Alienations and Contracts distributed into private possession, the alteration of Religion would necessarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce a change of Property. <hi>Nullum tempus occurrit Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elesiae,</hi> it would make a general Earth-quake over the nation, and even now the <hi>Romish</hi> Clergy on the other side of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:60385:8"/>
water, snuffe up the savoury odour of so many rich <hi>Abbies</hi> and <hi>Monasteries</hi> that belonged to their predecessors. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by no considerably Estate in <hi>England</hi> but must have a piece torn out of it upon the Titile of Piety, and the rest subject to be wholly forfeited upon the account of <hi>Heresy.</hi> Another <hi>Chimny mony</hi> of the old <hi>Peter pence</hi> must again be payed. as tribute to the Pope, beside that which is established on his Majesty: and the People, instead of those moderate Tithes that are with too much difficulty payed to their Protestant Pastors, will be exposed to all the exactions, of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and a thousand artifices by which in former times they were used to draine away the wealth of ours more then any other Nation. So that in conclusion, there is no <hi>English-man</hi> that hath a Soul, a Body, or an Estate to save, that Loves either God, his King, or his Country, but is by all those Tenures bound, to the best of his Power and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, to maintaine the established <hi>Protestant Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet, all this notwithstanding, there are those men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, who have undertaken, and do make it their busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, under so Legal and perfect a Government, to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a <hi>French</hi> slavery, and instead of so pure a Religion, to establish the <hi>Roman</hi> Idolatry: both and either of which are Crimes of the Highest nature. For, as to matter of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if to murther the King be, as certainly it is, a Fact so, horred, how much more hainous is it to assassinate the Kingdome? And as none will deny, that to alter our <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy</hi> into a <hi>Commonvvealth</hi> were <hi>Treason,</hi> so by the same Fundamenttal Rule, the Crime is no lesse to make that <hi>Monarchy Absolute.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What is thus true in regard of the State, holds as well in reference to our Religion. Former Parliaments have made it Treason in whosoever shall attempt to seduce any one, the meanest of the Kings subjects, to the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> And this Parliament hath, to all penalties by the Common or Statute Law, added incapacity for any man who shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:60385:8"/>
to say that the King is a Papist or an Introducer of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. But what lawless and incapable miscreants then, what wicked Traytors are those wretched men, who endevour to pervert our whole Church, and to bring that about in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, which even to mention is penal, at one <hi>Italian</hi> stroke attempting to subvert the Government and Religion, to kill the Body and damn the Soul of our Nation.</p>
            <p>Yet were these men honest old Cavaliers that had suffered in his late Majesties service, it were allowable in them, as oft as their wounds brake out at Spring or Fall, to think of a more Arbitrary Government, as a soveraign Balsom for their Aches, or to imagine that no Weapon-salve but of the Moss that grows on an Enemies Skul could cure them. Should they mistake this Long <hi>Parliament</hi> also for Rebells, and that, although all Circumstances be altered, there were still the same necessity to fight it all over again in pure Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, yet their Age and the Times they have lived in, might excuse them. But those worthy Gentlemen are too Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, too good Christians and Subjects, too affectionate to the good <hi>English</hi> Government, to be capable of such an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression. Whereas these Conspiratours are such as have not one drop of <hi>Cavalier Blood,</hi> or no <hi>Bovvels</hi> at least of a <hi>Cavalier</hi> in them; but have starved them, to Revel and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fet upon their Calamities, making their Persons, and the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Cause, by pretending to it themselves, almost Ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous.</p>
            <p>Or, were these <hi>Conspiratours</hi> on the other side but avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Papists,</hi> they were the more honest, the less dangerous, and the Religion were answerable for the Errours they might commit in order to promote it. Who is there but must acknowledge, if he do not commend the Ingenuity (or by what better Name I may call it) of Sir <hi>Thomas Strickland,</hi> Lord <hi>Bellassis,</hi> the late Lord <hi>Clifford</hi> and others, eminent in their several stations? These, having so long appeared the most zealous Sons of our Church, yet, as soon as the late
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:60385:9"/>
Test against Popery was inacted, tooke up the Crosse, quitted their present imployments and all hopes of the future, rather then falsify their opinion: though otherwise men for Quality, Estate and Abilityes whether in Warre or Peace, as capable and well deserving (without disparagement) as others that have the art to continue in Offices. And above all his Royal Highnesse is to be admired for his unparallelled mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity on the same account: there being in all history per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps no Record of any Prince that ever changed his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his circumstances. But these persons, that have since taken the worke in hand, are such as ly under no temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion: secure men, that are above either Honour or Consciencs; but obliged by all the most sacred tyes of Malice and Ambition to advance the ruine of the King and Kingdome, and qualified much better then others, under the name of good Protestants, to effect it.</p>
            <p>And because it was yet difficult to find Complices enough at home, that were ripe for so black a desing, but they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Back for their Edge; therefore they applyed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to <hi>France,</hi> that King being indowed with all those qualityes, which in a Prince, may passe for Virtues; but in any private man, would be capital; and moreover so abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in wealth that no man else could go to the price of their wickednesse: To which Considerations, adding that he is the Master of <hi>Absolute Dominion,</hi> the <hi>Presumptive Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arch</hi> of <hi>Christendom,</hi> the declared <hi>Champion</hi> of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the hereditary, natural, inveterate <hi>Enemy</hi> of our <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Nation,</hi> he was in all respects the most likely (of all Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Powers) to reward and support them in a Project every way suitable to his one Inclination and Interest.</p>
            <p>And now, should I enter into a particular retaile of all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and latter Transactions, relating to this affaire, there would be sufficient for a just Volume of History. But my intention is onely to write a naked Narrative of some the most considerable passages in the meeting of <hi>Parliament</hi>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:60385:9"/>
the 15 of <hi>Febr.</hi> 1676. Such as have come to my notice which may serve for matter to some stronger Pen and to such as have more leisure and further opportunity to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and communicate to the Publick. This in the mean time will by the Progresse made in so few weeks, demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate at what rate these men drive over the necks of King and People, of Religion and Government; and how near they are in all humane probability to arrive Triumphant at the end of their Journey. Yet, that I may not be too abrupt, and leave the Reader wholly destitute of a thread to guide himself by thorow so intriguing a Labyrinth, I shall summari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as short, as so copious and redundant a matter will admit, deduce the order of affaires both at home and abroad, as it led into this Session.</p>
            <p>It is well known, were it as well remembred, what the provocation was, and what the successe of the warre begun by the <hi>English</hi> i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> the Year 1665. against <hi>Holland:</hi> what vast supplyes were furnished by the Subject for defraying it, and yet after all. no Fleet set out, but the Flower of all the Royal Navy burnt or taken in Port to save charges. How the <hi>French,</hi> during that War, joyned themselves in assistance of <hi>Holland</hi> against us, and yet, by the credit he had with the Queen Mother, so farre deluded his Majesty, that upon assu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance the <hi>Dutch</hi> neither would have any Fleet out that year, he forbore to make ready, and so incurred that notable losse, and disgrace at <hi>Chatham.</hi> How (after this fatall conclusion of all our Sea-<hi>Champaynes)</hi> as we had been obliged to the <hi>French</hi> for that warre, so we were glad to receive the Peace from his favour which was agreed at <hi>Breda</hi> betwixt <hi>England, France,</hi> and <hi>Holland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His Majesty was hereby now at leisure to remarke how the <hi>French</hi> had in the year 1667. taken the time of us and while we were imbroled and weakned had in violation of all the most solemn and sacred Oaths and Treatyes invaded and taken a great part of the <hi>Spanish Nether-Land,</hi> which had
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:60385:10"/>
alwayes been considered as the natural Frontier of <hi>England.</hi> And hereupon he judged it necessary to interpose, before the flame that consumed his next neighbour should throw its sparkles over the water. And therefore, generously slight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all punctilious of ceremony or peeks of animosity, where the safty of his People and the repose of Christendom were concerned, he sent first into <hi>Holland,</hi> inviting them to a nearer Alliance, and to enter into such further Counsells as were most proper to quiet this publick disturbance which the <hi>French</hi> had raised. This was a work wholy of his Majestys designing and (according to that felicity which hath allways attended him, when excluding the corrupt Politicks of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he hath followed the dictates of his own Royal wisdom) so well it succeeded. It is a thing searse credible, though true, that two Treatyes of such weight, intricacy, and so various aspect as that of the Defensive League with <hi>Holland,</hi> and the other for repressing the further progresse of the <hi>French</hi> in the <hi>Spanish Netherland,</hi> should in five days time, in the year 1668. be concluded. Such was the Expedition and secrecy then used in prosecuting his Majesty particuler instructions, and so easy a thing is it for Princes, when they have a mind to it, to be well served. The <hi>Svvede</hi> too shortly after made the third in this Concert; whether wisely judging that in the minority of their King reigning over several late acquired dominions, it was their true intrest to have an hand in all the Counsells that tended to pease and undisturbed possession, or, whether indeed those ministers, like ours, did even then project in so glorious an Alliance to betray it afterward to their own greater advantage. From their joyning in it was called the Triple Alliance, His Majesty with great sincerity continued to solicite other Princes according to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Article to come into the Guaranty of this Treaty, and delighted himself in cultivating by all good means what he had planted. But in a very short time these Counsells, which had taken effect with so great satisfaction to the Nation and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:60385:10"/>
to his Majestyes eternal honour, were all changed and it seemed that Treatyes, as soon as the Wax is cold, do lose their virtue. The King in <hi>June</hi> 1670 went down to <hi>Dover</hi> to meet after a long absence. <hi>Madam,</hi> his onely remaining sister: where the days were the more pleasant, by how much it seldomer happens to Princes then private persons to injoy their Relations, and when they do, yet their kind interviews are usually solemnized with some fatlity and disaster, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of which here appeared. But upon her first return into <hi>France</hi> she was dead, the Marquess of <hi>Belfonds</hi> was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately sent hither, a Person, of great Honour dispatched thither? and, before ever the inquiry and grumbling at her death could be abated, in a trice there was an invisible Leagle, in prejudice of the Triple one, struck up with <hi>France,</hi> to all the height of dearnesse and affection. As if upon discecting the Princess there had some state Philtre been found in her bowells, or the reconciliation wiah <hi>France</hi> were not to be celebrated with a lesse sacrifice then of the Blood Royall of <hi>England.</hi> The sequel will be suitable to so ominous a beginning. But, as this Treaty was a work of Darknesse and which could never yet be understood or discovered but by the effects, so before those appeared it was necessary that the Parliament should after the old wont be gulld to the giving of mony. They met the 24th <hi>Oct.</hi> 1670. and it is not without much labour that I have been able to recover a written Copy of the Lord <hi>Bridgmans</hi> speech, none being printed, but forbidden, doubtlesse lest so notorious a Practise as certainly was never before, though there have indeed been many, put upon the Nation, might remain publick. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that Honourable person cannot be persumed to have been accessory to what was then intended, but was in due time, when the Project ripened and grew hopeful, discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from his Office, and he, the Duke of <hi>Ormond,</hi> the late Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary <hi>Trevor,</hi> with the Prince <hi>Rupert,</hi> discarded together out of the Committee for the <hi>Forraign</hi> Affaires, He spoke thus.</p>

There needed not so larg a Catalogue of pass, present and future Leagues and Treaties, for even <hi>Villa Franca</hi> soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded so well (being besides so considerable a Port, and that too upon the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> (another remote word of much efficacie) and opeing moreover a passage to a rich part of <hi>Italy,</hi> and a part of <hi>Germany, &amp;c.)</hi> that it alone would have sufficed to charm the more ready Votes of the Commons into a supply, and to justifie the Necessity of it in the noise of the Country. But indeed the making of that <hi>Tripple League,</hi> was a thing of so good a report and so generally acceptable to the Nation, as being a hook in the <hi>French</hi> nostrils, that this Parliament (who are used, whether it be War or Peace, to make us pay for it) could not have desired a fairer pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence to colour their liberality.</p>
            <p>And therefore after all the immense summs lavished in the former War with <hi>Holland,</hi> they had but in <hi>April</hi> last, 167<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>, given the <hi>Additional</hi> Duty upon Wines for 8 years; amounting to 560000 and confirmed the sale of the <hi>Fee Farm Rents,</hi> which was no lesse their gift, being a part of the publick Revenue, to the value of 180000l. Yet upon the telling of this Storie by the <hi>Lord Keeper,</hi> they could no longer hold but gave with both hands now again a Subsidy of 1s. in the pound to the real value of all Lands, and other Estates proportionably, with several more beneficial Clauses into the bargaine, to begin the 24 of <hi>June</hi> 1671, and expire the 24 of <hi>June</hi> 1672. Together with this, they granted the <hi>Additional Excise</hi> upon <hi>Beer, Ale, &amp;c.</hi> for six years, to reckon from the same 24th of <hi>June</hi> 1671. And lastly, the <hi>Lavv Bill</hi> commencing from the first of <hi>May</hi> 1671, and at nine yeares end to determine. These three Bills summed up therefore cannot be estimated at lesse than two millions and an half.</p>
            <p>So that for the <hi>Tripple League,</hi> here was, also <hi>Tripple-Supply,</hi> and the Subject had now all reason to beleive that this Alliance, which had been fixed at first by the <hi>Publick Interest, Safety</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> (yet, should any of those give way) was
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:60385:15"/>
by these <hi>Three Grants,</hi> as with three <hi>Golden Nailes,</hi> suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently clenched and reivetted. But now therefore was the most proper time and occasion for the Conspirators, I have before described, to give demonstration of their fidelitie to the <hi>French King</hi> and by the forfeiture of all these obligations to their King and Countrey, and other Princes, and at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense of all this Treasure given to contrarie uses, to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend themselves more meritoriously to his patronage.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Parliament</hi> having once given this Mony, were in consequence Prorogued, and met not again till the 4th of <hi>February</hi> 1672, that there might be a competent scope for so great a work as was desined, and the Architects of our Ruine might be so long free from their busie and odious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spection till it were finished. Henceforward, all the former applications made by his Majesty to induce Forraine Princes into the <hi>Guaranty</hi> of the Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chapelle</hi> ceased, and on the contrary, those who desired to be admitted into it, were here refused. The Duke of <hi>Loraine,</hi> who had alwaies been a true Freind to his Majesty, and by his affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the <hi>Tripple League</hi> had incurred the <hi>French Kings</hi> displeasure, with the losse of his whole Territorie, seised in the year 1669, against all Laws not only of <hi>Peace</hi> but <hi>Hosti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,</hi> yet was by means of these men rejected, that he might have no Intrest in the Alliance, for which he was sacrificed. Nay even the Emperour, though he did his Majesty the Honour to address voluntarily to him, that himself might be received into that <hi>Tripple League,</hi> yet could not so great a Prince prevail but was turned off with blind Reason, and most srivolous Excuses. So farre was it now from fortifying the Alliance by the Accession of other Princes, that Mr. <hi>Henry Goventry</hi> went now to <hi>Svveden</hi> expresly, as he affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at his departure hence, to dissolve the <hi>Tripple League.</hi> And he did so much towards it, cooperating in that Court with the <hi>French</hi> Ministers, that <hi>Svveden</hi> never (after it came to a Rupture) did assist or prosecute effectually the ends of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:60385:15"/>
               <hi>Alliance,</hi> but only arming it self at the expence of the <hi>Leagues</hi> did first, under a disguised Mediation, Act the <hi>French Interest,</hi> and at last threw off the <hi>Vizard,</hi> and drew the Sword in their Quarrel. Which is a matter of sad reflexion, that he, who in his <hi>Embassy</hi> at <hi>Breda,</hi> had been so happy an Instrument to end the first unfortunate War with <hi>Holland,</hi> should now be made the <hi>Toole</hi> of a second, and of breaking that threefold Cord, by which the Interest of <hi>England</hi> and all <hi>Christendom</hi> was fastned. And, what renders it more wretched, is, that no man better than He understood both the <hi>Theory</hi> and <hi>Practick</hi> of <hi>Honour;</hi> and yet, cold in so eminent an Instance, forget it. All which can be said in his excuse, is, that upon his return he was for this service made Secretary of State (as if to have remained the same <hi>Honest Gentleman,</hi> had not been more necessary and lesse dishonourable) Sir <hi>William Lockyard</hi> and several others were dispatched to other Courts upon the like errand.</p>
            <p>All things were thus farre well disposed here toward a War with <hi>Holland:</hi> only all this while there wanted a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel, and to pick one required much invention. For the <hi>Ducth</hi> although there was a <hi>si quis</hi> to find out complaints, and our <hi>East India</hi> Company was summoned to know whether they had any thing to object against them, had so punctually complyed with all the Conditions of the Peace at <hi>Breda,</hi> and observed his Majesty with such respect (and in paying the due Honour of the <hi>Flagg</hi> particulary as it was agreed in the 19th. Article) that nothing could be alleadged: and as to the <hi>Tripple League,</hi> their Fleet was then out, riding near their own Coasts, in prosecuting of the ends of that <hi>Treaty.</hi> Therefore, to try a new experiment and to make a Case which had never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore happened or been imagined, a sorry <hi>Yatch,</hi> but bearing the <hi>English Jack,</hi> in <hi>August</hi> 1671. Sailes into the midst of their Fleet, singled out the <hi>Admyral,</hi> shooting twice, as they call it, sharpe upon him. Which must sure have appeared as ridiculous, and unnatural as for a <hi>Larke</hi> to dare the <hi>Hobby.</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:60385:16"/>
Neverthelesse their Commander in Chief, in diference to his Majestys Colours, and in consideration of the Amity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Nations, payed our Admiral of the <hi>Yatch</hi> a visit, to know the reason; and learning that it was because he and his whole Fleet had failed to strike Saile to his small-craft, the <hi>Dutch Commander</hi> civilly excused it as a matter of the first instance, and in which he could have no Instructions, therefore proper to be referred to their Masters, and so they parted. The <hi>Yatch</hi> having thus acquitted it self, returned, fraught with the Quarrel she was sent for, which yet was for several months passed over here in silence without any Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint or demand of satisfaction, but to be improved after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards when occasion grew riper. Forthere was yet one thing more to be done at home to make us more capable of what was shortly after to be executed on our Neighbours.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Exohequer</hi> had now for some years by excessive gain decoy'd in the wealthy <hi>Goldsmiths,</hi> and they the rest of the Nation by due payment of Interest, till the King was run (upon what account I know not) into debt of above two Millions: which served for one of the pretences in my Lord <hi>Keepers Speech</hi> above recited, to demand and grant the late Supplies, and might have sufficed for that work, with peace and any tolerable good husbandry. But as if it had been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious to apply them to any one of the Purposes declared) it was instead of payment privately resolved to shut up the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> least any part of the money should be legally ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, but that all might be appropriate to the Holy War in project, and those further pious uses to which the Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rators had dedicated it.</p>
            <p>This affair was carried on with all the secresy of so great Statesmen, that they might not by venting it unseasonably spoile the wit and malice of the business. So that all on the suddain, upon the first of <hi>January</hi> 1671, to the great aston<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ishment, ruine and despaire of so many interested persons, and to the terrour of the whole Nation, by so Arbitrary a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:60385:16"/>
Fact, the Proclamation issued whereby the Crown, amid'st the confluence of so vast Aides and Revenue, published it self Bankrupt, made prize of the Subject, and broke all Faith and contract at home in order to the breaking of them abroad with more advantage.</p>
            <p>There remained nothing now but that the Conspirators, after this exploit upon our own Countrymen, should mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest their impartiallity to Forainers, and avoid on both sides the reproach of Injustice by their equality in the distribution. They had now started the dispute about the Flag upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion of the Yatch, and begun the discourse of <hi>Surinam,</hi> and somwhat of <hi>Pictures</hi> and <hi>Medalls,</hi> but they handled these mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters so nicely as men not lesse afraid of receiving all satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction therein from the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> then of giving them any umbrage of arming against them upon those pretenses. The <hi>Dutch</hi> therefore, not being conscious to themselves of any provocation given to <hi>England,</hi> but of their readinesse, if there had been any, to repair it, and relying upon that faith of Treatyes and Alliances with us, which hath been thought sufficient security, not only amongst <hi>Christians</hi> but even with <hi>Infidels,</hi> pursued their Traffick and Navigation thorow our Seas without the least suspicion. And accordingly a great and rich Fleet of Merchantmen from <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> were on their Voyage homeward near the Isle of <hi>Wight,</hi> under a small Convoy of five or six of their Men of War. This was the Fleet in contemplation of which the (conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors had so long deferred the War to plunder them in peace; the wealth of this was that which by its weight turned the Ballance of all Publick Justice and Honour; with this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure they imagined themselves in stock for all the wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of which they were capable, and that they should never, after this addition, stand in need again or fear of a Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Therefore they had with great stilnesse and expidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion equipped early in the year, so many of the Kings Ships as might without jealousy of the number, yet be of compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:60385:17"/>
strength for the intended action, but if any thing should chance to be wanting, they thought it abundantly supplyed by virtue of the Commander. For Sir <hi>Robert Holmes</hi> had with the like number of Ships in the year 1661, even so time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, commenced the first Hostility against <hi>Holand,</hi> in time of Peace; seizing upon <hi>Cape Verde,</hi> and other of the <hi>Dutch-Forts</hi> on the Coast of <hi>Guiny,</hi> and the whole <hi>Nevv Nether-lands,</hi> with great success: in defence of which Conquests, the <hi>English</hi> undertook, 1665, the first War against <hi>Holand.</hi> And in that same War, he with a proportionable Squadron signalized himself by burning the <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships and Village of <hi>Brandaris</hi> at <hi>Schelling,</hi> which was unfortunately revenged upon us at <hi>Chatham.</hi> So that he was pitched upon as the person for understanding, experience and courage, fittest for a design of this or any higher nature; and upon the 14th. of <hi>March,</hi> 1672. as they sailed on, to the number of 72 Vessells in all, whereof six the <hi>Convoy;</hi> near our Coast, he fell in upon them with his accustomed bravery, and could not have failed of giving a good account of them, would he but have joyned fortunes, Sr. <hi>Edvvard Spraggs</hi> Asistance to his own Conduct: For Sr. <hi>Edvvard</hi> was in sight at the same time with his Squadron, and Captaine <hi>Legg</hi> making saile towards him, to acquaint him with the design, till called back by a Gun from his Admirall, of which severall persons have had their conjectures. Possibly Sr. <hi>Robert Holmes,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering that <hi>Sr. Edvvard</hi> had sailed all along in consort with the <hi>Ducth</hi> in their voyage, and did but now return from bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pirates of <hi>Algier</hi> to reason, thought him not so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to ingage in this enterprise before he understood it bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. But it is rather beleived to have proceeded partly from that Jealousy (which is usuall to marshal spirits, like <hi>Sr. Roberts)</hi> of admitting a Companion to share with him in the Spoile of Honour or Profit; and partly out of too strict a regard to preserve the secret of his Commission. However, by this meanes the whole affair miscarried. For the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:60385:17"/>
Men themselves, and their little Convoy did so bestir them, that Sir <hi>Robert,</hi> although he shifted his Ship, fell foul on his best Friends, and did all that was possible, unless he could have multiplied himself, and been every where, was forced to give it over, and all the Prize that was gotten, sufficed not to pay the Chirurgeons and Carpenters.</p>
            <p>To descend to the very bottom of their hellish Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, there was yet one step more; that of Religion. For so pious and just an Action as Sir <hi>Robert Holmes</hi> was imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon, could not be better accompanied than by the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of <hi>Liberty of Conscience</hi> (unless they should have expected till he had found that pretious Commodity in plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the Hoale of some <hi>Amsterdam</hi> Fly-boat) Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, while he was trying his Fortune in Battle with the <hi>Smyrna</hi> Merchant-Men, on the <hi>thirteenth</hi> and <hi>fourteenth</hi> of <hi>Marcb, One thousand six hundred seventy tvvo,</hi> the <hi>Indulgence</hi> was Printing off here in all haste, and was Published on the <hi>fifteenth,</hi> as a more proper means than <hi>Fasting</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> for propitiating Heaven to give Success to his Enterprise, and to the War that must second it.</p>
            <p>Hereby, all the Penal <hi>Lavvs</hi> against <hi>Papists,</hi> for which former <hi>Parliaments</hi> had given so many Supplies, and against <hi>Nonconformists,</hi> for which this <hi>Parliament</hi> had payd more largly, were at one Instant Suspended, in order to defraud the Nation of all that <hi>Religion</hi> which they had so dearly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased, and for which they ought at least, the Bargain being broke, to have been re-imbursed.</p>
            <p>There is, I confess, a measure to be taken in those things, and it is indeed to the great reproach of Humane Wisdom, that no man has for so many Ages been able or willing to find out the due temper of Government in Divine Matters. For it appears at the first sight, that men ought to enjoy the same Propriety and Protection in their Consciences, which they have in their Lives, Liberties, and Estates: But that to take away these in Penalty for the other, is meerly a more Legal
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:60385:18"/>
and Gentile way of Padding upon the Road of Heaven, and that it is only for want of Money and for want of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion that men take those desperate Courses.</p>
            <p>Nor can it be denied that the <hi>Original Lavv</hi> upon which Christianity at the first was founded, does indeed expresly provide against all such severity. And it was by the Humility, Meekness, Love, Forbearance and Patience which were part of that excellent Doctrine, that it became at last the Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal Religion, and can no more by any other meanes be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, than it is possible for another Soul to animate the same Body.</p>
            <p>But, with shame be it spoken, the <hi>Spartans</hi> obliging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to <hi>Lycargus</hi> his Laws, till he should come back again, continued under his most rigid Discipline, above twice as long as the Christians did endure under the gentelest of all Institutions, though with far more certainty expecting the return of their <hi>Divine Legislater</hi> Insomuch that it is no great Adventure to say, That the World was better ordered under the Antient <hi>Monarchies</hi> and <hi>Commonvvealths,</hi> that the number of Virtuous men was then greater, and that the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians found fairer quarter under those, than among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, nor hath there any advantage acrued unto mankind from that most perfect and practical <hi>Moddel</hi> of <hi>Humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> except the Speculation of a better way to future Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness, concerning which the very Guides disagree, and of those few that follow, it will suffer no man to pass without paying at their <hi>Turn-pikes.</hi> All which had proceeded from no other reason, but that men in stead of squaring their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments by the Rule of Christianity, have shaped Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity by the Measures of their Government, have reduced that streight Line by the crooked, and bungling Divine and Humane things together, have been alwayes hacking and hewing one another, to frame an irregular Figure of Political Incongruity.</p>
            <p>For wheresoever either the Magistrate, or the Clergy, or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:60385:18"/>
the People could gratify their Ambition, their Profit, or their Phanfie by a Text improved or misapplied, that they made use of though against the consent sense and immutable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of <hi>Scipture,</hi> and because Obedience for Conscience sake was there prescribed, the lesse Conscience did men make in Commanding; so that several Nations have little else to shew for their Christiainity (which requires Instruction only and Example) but a pracell of sever Laws concerning Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion or about the Modes of Worship, not so much in order to the Power of Religion as over it. Neverthelesse because Mankind must be governed some way and be held up to one Law or other, either of Christs or their own making, the vigour of such humane Constitutions is to be preserved un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the same Authority shall upon better reason revoke them; and as in the mean time no private man may without the guilt of Sedition or Rebellion resist, so neither by the Nature of the <hi>English</hi> Foundation can any Publick Person suspend them without committing an Errour which is not the lesse for wanting a legall name to expresse it. But it was the Master-peice therefore of boldnesse and contrivance in these Conspiratours to issue this Declaration, and it is hard to say wherein they took the greater felicity, whither in suspending hereby all the Statutes against Popery, that it might thence forward passe like current money over the Nation, and no man dare to refuse it, or whether gaining by this a President to suspend as well all other Laws that respect the Subjects Propriety, and by the same power to abrogate and at last inact what they pleased, till there should be no further use for the Consent of the <hi>People in Parliament.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having been thus true to their great designe and made so considerable a progresse, they advanced with all expedition. It was now high time to Declare the War, after they had begun it; and therefore by a <hi>Manifesto</hi> of the seventeenth of <hi>March</hi> 1672, the pretended Causes were made publich
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:60385:19"/>
which were, The not having Vailed Bonnet to the <hi>English</hi> Yatch: though the <hi>Duch</hi> had all along, both at home and here as carefully endevoured to give, as the <hi>English Minestrs</hi> to avoid the receiving of all satisfaction, or letting them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand what would do it, and the Council Clock was on purpose set forward lest, their utmost Compliance in the Flag at the hour appointed, should prevent the Declaration of War by some minuts. The detaining of some few <hi>English</hi> families (by their own Consent) in <hi>Surynam</hi> after the Dominion of it was by Treaty surrendred up to the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lander,</hi> in which they had likewise constantly yielded to the unreasonable demands that were from one time to another extended from hence to make the thing impracticable, till even <hi>Banister</hi> himself, that had been imployed as the Agent and Contriver of this misunderstanding, could not at the last forbear to cry shame of it. And moreover to fill up the measure of the <hi>Dutch</hi> iniquity, they are accused of Pillars, Medalls, and Pictures: a Poet indeed, by a dash of his Pen, having once been the cause of a Warre against <hi>Poland;</hi> but this certainely was the first time that ever a <hi>Painter</hi> could by a stroke of his Pencill occasion the Breach of a Treaty. But considering the weaknesse and invalidity of those other al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legations, these indeed were not unnecessary, the Pillars to adde strength, the Meddalls Weight, and the Pictures Colour to their Reasons.</p>
            <p>But herein they had however observed Faith with <hi>France</hi> though on all other sides broken, having capitulated to be the first that should do it. Which as it was no small peice of <hi>French</hi> Courtesey in so important an action to yield the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish</hi> the Precedence, so was it on the <hi>English</hi> part as great a Bravery in accepting to be the formost to discompose the State of all <hi>Christendom,</hi> and make themselves principal to all the horrid Destruction, Devastation, Ravage and Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:60385:19"/>
which from that fatal <hi>seventeenth</hi> of <hi>March, One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand six hundred seventy tvvo,</hi> has to this very day conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued.</p>
            <p>But that which was most admirable in the winding up of this <hi>Declaration,</hi> was to behold these Words,</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>And vvhereas vve are engaged by a Treaty to support the Peace made at</hi> Aix la Chapelle; <hi>We do finally Declare, that, notvvithstanding thé Prosecution of this War, We vvill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the true intent and scope of the said Treaty, and that, in all Alliances, vvhich We have, or shall make in the progress of this War, vve have, and vvill take care, to preserve the ends thereof inviolable, unless provoked to the contrary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet it is as clear as the Sun, that the <hi>French</hi> had by that Treaty of <hi>Aix la Chapelle,</hi> agreed to acquiess in their former Conquests in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and that the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, Svvede</hi> and <hi>Hollander,</hi> were reciprocally bound to be aiding against whomsoever should disturbe that Regulation, (besides the League Offensive and Defensive, which his Majesty had entered into with the States General of the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Provinces) all which was by this Conjunction with <hi>France</hi> to be broken in pieces. So that what is here decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, if it were reconcileable to Truth, yet could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sist with Possibility (which two do seldom break company) unless by one only Expedient, that the <hi>English,</hi> who by this new League with <hi>France,</hi> were to be the Infractors and Aggressors of the Peace of <hi>Aix la Chapelle</hi> (and with <hi>Holland)</hi> should to fulfill their Obligations to both Parties, have sheathed the Sword in our own Bowels.</p>
            </q>
            <p>But such was the Zeal of the Conspirators, that it might easily transport them either to say what was untrue, or undertake what was impossible, for the <hi>French</hi> Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:60385:20"/>
That King having seen the <hi>English</hi> thus engaged beyond a Retreat, comes now into the War according to agreement. But he was more Generous and Monarchal than to assign Cause, true or false, for his Actions. He therefore, on the <hi>27th.</hi> of <hi>March</hi> 1672, publishes a Declaration of War with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Reasons. Only, <hi>The ill satisfaction vvhich his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty hath of the Behaviour of the States General tovvards him, being risen to that degree, that he can no longer, vvithout dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution to his Glory dissemble his Indignation against them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therefore he hath resolved to make War against them both by Sea and Land,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And commands all his Subjects, Courir sus,</hi> upon the <hi>Hollauders,</hi> (a Metaphor which, out of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect to his own Nation, might have been spared) <hi>For such is our pleasure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Was ever in any Age or Nation of the World, the Sword drawn upon no better Allegation? A stile so far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Most Christian,</hi> that nothing but some vain <hi>French</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance can parallel or justify the Expression. How happy were it could we once arrive at the same pitch, and how much credit and labour had been saved, had the Compilers of our Declaration, in stead of the mean <hi>English</hi> way of gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Reasons, contented themselves with that of the Dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the <hi>English Honour,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> of his <hi>Glory!</hi> But nevertheless, by his Embassador to the <hi>Pope,</hi> he gave after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a more clear account of his Conjunction with the <hi>English,</hi> and that he had not undertaken this War, against the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> but for extirpating of Heresie. To the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, That the <hi>Hollanders</hi> were a People who had forsaken God, were Hereticks, and that all good Christians were in duty bound to associate for their extiapation, and ought to pray to God for a blessing upon so pious an enterprise. And to other Popish Princes, that it was a War of Religion and in order to the Propagation of the Catholick Faith.</p>
            <p>And in the second Article of his Demands afterward from the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> it is in express words contained, <hi>That from</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:60385:20"/>
               <hi>thenceforvvard there shall be not only an intire Liberty, but a Publick Exercise of the Catholick Apostolick Romane Religion throughout all the United Provinces. So that vvheresoever there shall be more than one-Church, another shall be given to the Catholicks. That vvhere there is none, they shall be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to build one: and till that be finished, to exercise their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service publickly in such Houses as they shall buy, or hire for that purpose. That the States General, or each Province in particular, shall appoint a reasonable Salary for a Curate or Priest in each of the said Churches, out of such Revenues as have formerly appertained to the Church, or othervvise.</hi> Which was conformable to what he published now abroad, that he had entered into the War only for Gods Glory; and that he would lay down Armes streightwayes, would the <hi>Holland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> but restore the True Worship in their Dominions.</p>
            <p>But he made indeed twelve Demands more, and notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing all this devotion, the Article of Commerce, and for revoking their <hi>Placaets</hi> against Wine, Brandy, and French manufactures was the first, and tooke place of the <hi>Catholick Apostolick Romane Religion,</hi> Whether all these were therefore onely words of course, and to be held or let lose according to his occasions, will better appeare when we shall have heard that he still insists upon the same at <hi>Nimegen,</hi> and that, although deprived of our assistance, he will not yet agree with the <hi>Dutch</hi> but upon the termes of restoring the <hi>True Worship.</hi> But, whatever he were, it is evident that the <hi>English</hi> were sincere and in good earnest in the Design of Popery; both by that Declaration above mentioned of Indulgence to the Recusants, and by the Negotiation of those of the <hi>English</hi> Plenipotentiaryes (whom for their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour I name not) that being in that year sent into <hi>Holland</hi> pressed that Article among the rest upon them, as without which they could have no hope of Peace with <hi>England.</hi> And the whole processe of affaires will manifest further that booth here and there it was all of a piece, as to the project of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:60385:21"/>
and the same threed ran throw the Web of the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Counsells, no lesse in relation to that, then unto Government.</p>
            <p>Although the issuing of the <hi>French</hi> Kings declaration and the sending of our <hi>English Plenipotentiaries</hi> into <hi>Holland</hi> be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved together in this last period, yet the difference of time was so small that the anticipation is inconsiderable. For having declared the VVarre but on the 27th of <hi>March,</hi> 1672. He struck so home and followed his blow so close, that by <hi>July</hi> following, it seemed that <hi>Holland</hi> could no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er stand him, but that the swiftnesse and force of his motion was something supernatural. And it was thought necessary to send over those <hi>Plenipotentiaries,</hi> if not for Interest yet at least for Curiosity. But it is easier to find the Markes than Reasons of some mens Actions, and he that does only know what happened before, and what after, might perhaps wrong them by searching for further Intelligence.</p>
            <p>So it was, that the <hi>English</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Navies being joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were upon the <hi>Tvventieighth</hi> of <hi>May, One thousand six hundred seventy tvvo,</hi> Attaqued in <hi>Soule Bay</hi> by <hi>De Ruyter,</hi> with too great advantage. For while his Royal Highness, then <hi>Admiral,</hi> did all that could be expected, but <hi>Monsieur d' Estree,</hi> that commanded the <hi>French,</hi> did all that he was sent for, Our <hi>English Vice-Admiral, Mountague,</hi> was sacrificed; and the rest of our Fleet so mangled, that there was no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to boast of Victory. So that being here still on the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing hand, 'twas fit some body should look to the Betts on the other side of the Water; least that Great and Lucky Gamster, when he had won all there, and stood no longer in need of the Conspirators, should pay them with a Quarrel for his Mony, and their ill Fortune. Yet were they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scious to themselves of having given him by any <hi>Behaviour</hi> of theirs, any cause of <hi>Dissatisfaction,</hi> but that they had dealt with him in all things most frankly, That, notwithstanding all the Expressions in my Lord Keeper <hi>Bridgmans</hi> Speech,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:60385:21"/>
of the <hi>Treaty betvveen</hi> France <hi>and his Majesty concerning Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, vvherein his Majesty vvill have a singular regard to the Honour and also to the Trade of this Nation,</hi> and notwithstand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the intollerable oppressions upon the <hi>English Traffick</hi> in <hi>France</hi> ever since the Kings Restauration, they had not in all that time made one step towards a Treaty of Commerce or Navigation with him; no not even now when the <hi>English</hi> were so necessary to him, that he could not have begun this War without them, and might probably therefore in this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture have condescended to some equality. But they knew how tender that King was on that point, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve and encrease the Trade of his Subjects, and that it was by the <hi>Diminution</hi> of that Beam of his <hi>Glory,</hi> that the <hi>Hollan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> had raised his <hi>Indignation.</hi> The Conspirators had therefore, the more to gratify him, made it their constant Maxime, to burden the <hi>English</hi> Merchant here with one hand, while the <hi>French</hi> should load them no less with the other, in his Teritories; which was a parity of Trade in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, though something an extravagant one, but the best that could be hoped from the prudence and integrity of our States-men; insomuch, that when the Merchants have at any time come down from <hi>London</hi> to represent their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances from the <hi>French,</hi> to seek redress, or offer their humble advi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>e, they were Hector'd, Brow-beaten, Ridiculed, and might have found fairer audience even from <hi>Monsieur Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They knew moreover, that as in the matter of Commerce, so they had more obliged him in this War. That except the irresistable bounties of so great a Prince in their own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and a frugal Subsistance-money for the Fleet, they had put him to no charges, but the <hi>English</hi> Navy Royal serv'd him, like so many <hi>Privateers,</hi> No <hi>Purchase,</hi> No <hi>Pay.</hi> That in all things they had acted with him upon the most abstract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Principles of Generosity. They had tyed him to no
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:60385:22"/>
terms, had demanded no Partition of Conquests, had made no humane Condition; but had sold all to him for those two Pearls of price, the <hi>True Worship,</hi> and the <hi>True Government:</hi> Which disinteressed proceeding of theirs, though suited to Forraine Magnanimity, yet, should we still lose at Sea, as we had hitherto, and the <hi>French</hi> Conquer all at Land, as it was in prospect, might at one time or other breed some difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in answering for it to the King and Kingdom: However this were, it had so hapned before the arrival of the <hi>Plenipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiaries,</hi> that, whereas here in <hi>England,</hi> all that brought ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plycations from <hi>Holland</hi> were treated as Spies and Enemies, till the <hi>French King</hi> should signify his pleasure; he on the contrary, without any communication here, had received Addresses from the <hi>Dutch Plenipotentiaries,</hi> and given in to them the sum of his Demands (not once mentioning his Majesty or his Interest, which indeed he could not have done unless for mockery, having demanded all for himself, so that there was no place left to have made the <hi>English</hi> any satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction) and the <hi>French</hi> Ministers therefore did very candidly acquaint those of <hi>Holland,</hi> that, upon their accepting those Articles, there should be a firm Peace, and Amity restored: But as for <hi>England,</hi> the States, their Masters, might use their discretion, for that <hi>France</hi> was not obliged by any Treaty to procure their advantage.</p>
            <p>This manner of dealing might probably have animated, as it did warrant the <hi>English Plenipotentiaries,</hi> had they been as full of Resolution as of Power, to have closed with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> who, out of aversion to the <hi>French,</hi> and their intolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable demands, were ready to have thrown themselves into his Majesties Armes, or at his Feet, upon any reasonable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; But it wrought clean otherwise: For, those of the <hi>English Plenipotentiaries,</hi> who were, it seems, intrusted with a fuller Authority, and the deeper Secret, gave in also the <hi>English</hi> Demands to the <hi>Hollanders,</hi> consisting in eight Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, but at last the Ninth saith,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:60385:22"/>
               <q>
                  <hi>Although his Majesty contents himself vvith the foregoing Conditions, so that they be accepted vvithin ten dayes, after vvhich his Majesty understands himself to be no further obliged by them. He declares nevertheless precisely, that albeit they should all of them be granted by the said States, yet they shall be of no force, nor vvill his Majesty ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>e any Treaty of Peace or Truce, unless the</hi> Most Christian King <hi>shall have received sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfastion from the said States in his particular.</hi> 
               </q>And by this means they made it impossible for the <hi>Dutch,</hi> however de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous, to comply with <hi>England,</hi> excluded us from more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantagious terms, than we could at any other time hope for, and deprived us of an honest, and honourable evasion out of so pernicious a War, and from a more dangerous Alliance. So that now it appeared by what was done that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirtors securing their own fears at the price of the Publick Interest, and Safety, had bound us up more strait then ever, by a new Treaty, to the <hi>French</hi> Project.</p>
            <p>The rest of this year passed with great successe to the <hi>French,</hi> but none to the <hi>English.</hi> And therefore the hopes upon which the War was begun, of the <hi>Smyrna</hi> and <hi>Span<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi> Fleet, and <hi>Dutch</hi> Prizes, being vanished, the slender Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance from the <hi>French</hi> not sufficing to defray it, and the ordinary Revenue of the King, with all the former Aides be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as was fit to be believed) in lesse then one years time exhausted, The Parliament by the Conspirators good leave, was admitted again to sit at the day appointed, the 4th. of <hi>February</hi> 1672.</p>
            <p>The Warr was then first communicated to them, and the Causes, the Necessity, the Danger, so well Painted out, that the <hi>Dutch</hi> abusive Historical Pictures, and False Medalls (which were not forgot to be mentioned) could not be better imitated or revenged, Onely, there was one great omission of their False Pillars, which upheld the whole Fabrick of the <hi>England</hi> Declarations; Upon this signification, the House of Commons (who had never failed the Crown hitherto up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:60385:23"/>
any occosion of mutual gratuity) did now also, though in a Warre contrary to former usuage, begun without their Advice, readily Vote, no less a summe than 1250000 <hi>l.</hi> But for better Colour, and least they should own in words, what they did in effect, they would not say it was for the Warre, but for the Kings Extraordinary Occasions.</p>
            <p>And because the Nation began now to be aware of the more true Causes, for which the Warre had been undertaken, they prepared an Act before the Money-Bill slipt thorrow their Fingers, by which the Papists were obliged, to pass thorow a new State Purgatory, to be capable of any Publick Imployment; whereby the House of Commons, who seem to have all the Great Offices of the Kingdom in Reversion, could not but expect some Wind-falls.</p>
            <p>Upon this Occasion it was, that the Earl of <hi>Shafts<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,</hi> though then Lord Chancellour of <hi>England,</hi> yet, Engaged so far in Defence of that ACT, and of the PROTESTANT RELIGION, that in due time it cost him his Place, and was the first moving Cause of all those Misadventures, and Obloquy, which since he lyes <hi>(ABOVE,</hi> not) <hi>Under.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Declaration also of Indulgence was questioned, which, though his MAJESTY had out of his Princely, and Gracious Inclination, and the memory of some former Obligations, granted, yet upon their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation of the Inconveniencies, and at their humble Request, he was pleased to Cancel, and Declare, that it should be no President for the Future: For other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise some succeeding Governour, by his single Power Suspending Penal Laws, in a favourable matter, as that is of Religion, might become more dangerous to the Government, than either Papists or Fanaticks, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:60385:23"/>
make us <hi>Either,</hi> when he pleased: So Legal was it in this Session to Distinguish between the King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands</hi> Personal, and his Parliamentary Authority.</p>
            <p>But therefore the further sitting being grown very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>easie to those, who had undertaken for the Change of Religion, and Government, they procured the Recess so much sooner, and a Bill sent up by the Commons in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of Dissenting Protestants, not having passed thorow the Lords preparation, the Bill concerning Papists, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted in Exchange for the Money, by which the Conspira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iors, when it came into their management, hoped to fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate, yet, the effect of the former. So the Parliament was dismissed till the <hi>Tvventy seventh</hi> of <hi>October, One thousand six hundred seventy three.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the mean time therefore they strove with all their might to regain by the VVar, that part of their Design, which they had lost by Parliament; and though several ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably forsook their Places rather than their Consciences, yet there was never wanting some double-dyed Son of our Church, some Protestant in grain, to succeed upon the same Conditions. And the difference was no more, but that their Offices, or however their Counsels, were now to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ministred by their Deputies, such as they could confide in.</p>
            <p>The business of the Land Army was vigourously carried on, in appearance to have made some descent in <hi>Holland,</hi> but though the Regiments were Compleated and kept Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodyed, it wanted effect, and therefore gave cause of suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition: The rather, because no <hi>Englishman,</hi> among so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny well-disposed, and qualified for the work, had been thought capable, or fit to be trusted with Chief Command of those Forces, but that <hi>Monsieur Schomberg</hi> a <hi>French</hi> Protestant, had been made General, and Collonel <hi>Fitsge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald,</hi> an <hi>Irish</hi> Papist, Major General, as more proper for the Secret; the first of advancing the <hi>French</hi> Government, the second of promoting the <hi>Irish</hi> Religion.</p>
            <p>

And therefore the dark hovering of that Army so long at <hi>Black-Hearth,</hi> might not improbably seem the gatherings of a Storm to fall upon <hi>London;</hi> But the ill successes which our Fleet met withall this Year, also, at Sea, were sufficient, had there been any such design at home to have quasht it: for such Gallantries are not to be attempted, but in the highest raptures of Fortune.</p>
            <p>There were three several Engagements of ours against the <hi>Dutch Navy</hi> in this one Summer, but while nothing was Tenable at Land, against the <hi>French,</hi> it seem'd that to us at Sea every thing was impregnable; which is not to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the want of Courage or Conduct, either the former Year under the Command of his Royal Highness, so Great a Souldier, or this Year under the Prince, <hi>Robert;</hi> But is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be imputed to our unlucky Conjunction with the <hi>French,</hi> like the disasters that happen to men by being in ill Company.</p>
            <p>But besides it was manifest that in all these Wars, the <hi>French</hi> ment nothing less than really to assist us: He had first pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctised the same Art at Sea, when he was in League with the <hi>Hollander</hi> against us, his Navy never having done them any service, for his business was only to see us Batter one another. And now he was on the <hi>English</hi> side, he only studied to sound our <hi>Seas,</hi> to spy our <hi>Ports,</hi> to learn our <hi>Building,</hi> to contemplate our way of <hi>Fight,</hi> to consume ours, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve his own <hi>Navy,</hi> to encrease his <hi>Commerce,</hi> and to order all so, that the two great Naval Powers of <hi>Europe,</hi> being crushed together, he might remain sole Arbitrator of the Ocean, and by consequence Master of all the Isles and Continent. To which purposes the Conspirators furnished him all possible opportunities. Therefore it was that <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sieur d' Estree,</hi> though a Person otherwise of tryed Courage and Prudence, yet never did worse than in the third and last Engagement; and because brave <hi>Monsieur d' Martel</hi> did better, and could not endure a thing that looked like Cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise

or Treachery, though for the Service of his Monarch, commanded him in, rated him, and at his return home he was, as then was reported, discountenanced and dismissed from his Command, for no other crime, but his breaking of the <hi>French</hi> measures, by adventuring one of those sacred Shipps in the <hi>English,</hi> or, rather his own Masters Quarrel.</p>
            <p>His Royal Highnesse (by whose having quitted the Admiralty, the Sea service thrived not the better) was now intent upon his Marrige, at the same time the Parliament was to reassemble the 27th of <hi>October</hi> 1673. the Princesse of <hi>Modena,</hi> his consort, being upon the way for <hi>England,</hi> and that businesse seemed to have passed all impediment. Nor were the Conspirators who (to use the <hi>French</hi> phrase) made a considerable Figure in the Government, wholly averse to the Parliaments meeting: For if the House of Commons had after one years unfortunate War, made so vast a Present to his Majesty of 1250000 <hi>l.</hi> But the last <hi>February,</hi> it seemed the argument would now be more pressing upon them, that by how much the ill sucesses, of this year had been greater, they ought therefore to give a yet more liberal Donative. And the Conspirators as to their own particular reckoned, that while the Nation was under the more distresse and hurry they were themselves safer from Parliament, by the Publick Calamity.</p>
            <p>A supply therefore was demanded with much more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and assurance then ever before, and that it should be a large one and a speedy: They were told that it was now <hi>Pro Aris &amp; Focis,</hi> all was at stake, And yet besides all this, the Payment of the Debt to the Banckers upon shutting the Exchequer was very civilly recommended to them. And they were assured that his Majesty would be constantly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to give them all proofes of his Zeal for the true Religion and the Laws of the Realm, upon all occasions: But the House of Commons not having been sufficiently prepared for such demands, nor well satisfied in several matters of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:60385:25"/>
Fact, which appeared contrary to what was represented, took check; and first interposed in that tender point of his Royall Highuesse's Match, although she was of his own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is a redoubled sort of Marriage, or the more spiritual part of its Happynesse. Besides, that she had been already solemnly married by the Dukes Proxcy, so that unlesse the Parliament had been Pope and calmed a power of Dispensation, it was now too late to avoide it. His Majesty by a short Prorogation of six days, when he understood their intention, gave them opportunity to have disisted: But it seems they judged the National Jnterest of Religion so farre concerned in this matter, that they no sooner meet again, but they drew up a second request by way of Addresse to his Majesty with their Reasons against it. That for his Royal Highnesse to marry the Princesse of <hi>Modena,</hi> or any other of that Religion, had very dangerous consequences: That the mindes of his Majesties Protestant subjects will be much disquieted, thereby filled with infinite discontents, and Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousies. That his Majesty would thereby be linked into such a foraine Alliance, which will be of great disadvantage and possibly to the Ruine of the Protestant Religion. That they have found by sad experience how such mariages have always increased Popery, and incorraged Priests and Jesuits to prevert his Majesties subjects: That the Popish party already lift up their heads in hopes of his marriage: That they fear it may diminish the affection of the people toward his Royal Highnesse, who is by blood so near related to the Crown: That it is now more then one Age, that the subjects have lived in continual apprehensions of the increase of Popery, and the decay of the Protestant Religion: Finally that she having many Kindred and Relations in the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> by this means their enterprises here might be facilitated, they might pierce into the most secret Counsells of his Majesty, and discover the state of the Realm. That the most learned men are of opinion, that Marriages no further Proceeded in,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:60385:25"/>
may lawfully be Dissolved: And therefore they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seech his Majesty to Annul the Consummation of it, and the Rather, because they have not yet the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness to see any of his Majestyes own Lineage to Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in his Kingdomes.</p>
            <p>These Reasons, which were extended more amply against his Royal Highnesses Marriage, obtained more weight, because most men are apt to Judge of things by Circumstances, and to attribute what happens by the Conjuncture of Times, to the Effect of Contrivance. So that it was not difficult to Interpret what was in his Royal Highness, an ingagement only of Honour, and Affection, as proceeding from the Conspirators Counsels, seeing it made so much to their purpose.</p>
            <p>But the business was too far advanced to retreat, as his Majesty with great reason had replyed, to their former Address, the Marriage having been celebrated already, and confirmed by his Royal Authority, and the House of Commons though sitting when the Duke was in a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for the Arch Dutchess of <hi>Inspruck,</hi> one of the same Religion, yet having taken no notice of it.</p>
            <p>Therefore while they pursued the matter thus, by a second Address, it seemed an easier thing, and more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, to Prorogue the Parliament, than to Dissolve the Marriage. And, which might more incline his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to this Resolution, the House of Commons had now bound themselves up by a Vote that having considered the present State of the Nation, they would not take into
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:60385:26"/>
Deliberation, nor have any further Debate upon any other Proposals of Aide, or any Surcharge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subject, before the payment of the <hi>Tvvelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty thousand pounds,</hi> in <hi>eighteen Months,</hi> which was last granted, were expired, or at least till they should evidently see that the Obstinacy of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> should oblige them to the contrary, nor till after the kingdom should be effectually secured against the dangers of Popery, and Popish Counsellours, and that Order be taken against other present Misdemeanours.</p>
            <p>There was yet another thing, the Land-Army, which appearing to them expensive, needless, and terrible to the People, they addressed to his Majesty also, that they might be disbanded. All which things put together, his Majesty was induced to Prorogue the Parliament again for a short time, till the <hi>seventh</hi> of <hi>January, One thousand six hundred seventy three:</hi> That in the mean while the Princess of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dena</hi> arriving, the Marriage might be consummated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further interruption.</p>
            <p>That Session was opened with a large deduction also, by the new Lord <hi>Keeper,</hi> this being his first Experiment, in the Lords House of his Eloquence and Veracity, of the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> averseness to Peace or Reason, and their uncivil and indirect dealing in all Overtures of Treaty with his Majesty, and a Demand was made therefore and re-inforced as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly, of a proportionable and speedy Supply. But the <hi>Hollanders</hi> that had found themselves obstructed alwayes hitherto, and in a manner excluded from all Applications, and that whatever means they had used was still mis-interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and ill represented, were so industrious, as by this time (which was perhaps the greatest part of their Crime) to have undeceived the generallity of the Nation in those parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:60385:26"/>
The House of Commons therefore not doubting, but that if they held their hands in matter of money, a Peace would in due time follow, grew troublesome rather to several of the great Ministers of State, whom they suspected to have been Principal in the late pernicious Counsels. But instead of the way of Impeachment, whereby the Crimes might have been brought to Examination, Proof and Judgment, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Summarily within themselves, noting them only with an ill Character, and requesting his Majesty to remove them from his Counsels, his Presence, and their Publick Imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Neither in that way of handling were they Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial.</p>
            <p>Of the three which were questioned, the Duke of <hi>Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> seemed to have muoh the more favourable Cause, but had the severest Fortune. And this whole matter not having been mannaged in the solemn Methods of National Justice, but transmitted to his Majesty, it was easily changed into a Court Intrigue, where though it be a Modern <hi>Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime,</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>

               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Yet other Offenders thought it of security to themselves, in a time of Publick Discontent, to have one Man sacrisi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, and so the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> having worse Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and as it chanced worse Friends, than the rest, was after all his Services abandoned, they having only heard the sound, while he felt all the smart of that Lash from the House of Commons.</p>
            <p>But he was so far a Gainer, that with the loss of his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and dependance, he was restored to the Freedom of his own Spirit, to give thence-forward those admirable

            <p>The <hi>Hollanders</hi> Proposalls, by this means, therefore, began to be thought more reasonable, and the <hi>Marquis del Fresno,</hi> the <hi>Spanish</hi> Minister in this Court, labourd so well, that his Majesty thought fit to Communicate the overture to both Houses, and though their advice had not been asked to the War, yet not to make the Peace without it. There was not much difficulty in their resolutions. For the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall bent of the Nation was against the War, the <hi>French</hi> now had by their ill behaviour at Sea, in all the Engagements, raised also the <hi>English</hi> Indignation, their pernicious Counsels were visible in their book of the <hi>Politique Francoise,</hi> tending by frequent levyes of men, and mony, to exhaust, and weaken our Kingdome, and by their conjuction with us, on set purpose, to raise, betwixt the King and his People, a rationall Jealousy of Popery, and <hi>French</hi> Government, till we should insensibly devolve into them by Inclination or Necessity: As men of ill conversation, pin themselves maliciously on persons more sober, that if they can no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise debauch them, they may blast their Reputation by their society, and so oblige them to theirs; being suspected by bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Company.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:60385:27"/>
Besides all which the very reason of Traffick which hath been so long neglected by our greater Statesmen was now of some consideration, for as much as by a Peace with the <hi>Hollander</hi> the greatest part of the Trade and Navigation of <hi>Europe</hi> as long as the <hi>French</hi> King disturbed it, would of course fall into the <hi>English</hi> management. The Houses there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gave their humble advice to his Majesty for a just and honorable Peace with the States Generall, which when it could be no longer resisted, was concluded.</p>
            <p>In the seventh Article of this Treaty it is said.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>That the Treaty vvhich vvas made at</hi> Breda <hi>in the yeare</hi> 1667, <hi>as also all the others vvhich are by this present Treaty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, shall by the present be renevved, and shall continue in their full force and vigour, as far as they shall not be contrary unto this said present Treaty.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Which words are the more to be taken notice of, that they may be compared afterwards with the effects that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, to see how well on the <hi>English</hi> part that Agreement hath been observed.</p>
            <p>The businesse of the Peace thus being once over, and this Parliament still lowring upon the Ministers of State, or bog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling at the Land Forces (whereof the eight new raised Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments were upon the request of the Commons at last dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banded) or imployed in further Bills against Popery, and for the Education, and Protestant Marriage henceforward of those of the Royal Family; the necessity of their further sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting seemed not so urgent, but that they might have a repose till the tenth of <hi>November</hi> 1674. following.</p>
            <p>The Conspirators had hitherto failed of the accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their design, by prepetual disappointments, and which
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:60385:28"/>
was most grievous to them, foresaw, that the want of mony would still necessitate the frequent sitting of Parliament, which danger they had hop'd long ere this to have conquer'd In this state of their affaires the <hi>French</hi> King therefore was by no meanes to be further disobliged, he being the Master of their secret, and the only person which if they helped him at this plunge, might yet carry them thorow. They were therefore very diligent to profit themselves of all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to this purpose that their present posture could afford them. They knew that his Majesty being now disengaged from War, would of his Royall Prudence interpose for Peace by his Mediation, it being the most glorious Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter that any Prince can assume; and for which he was the more proper, as being the most Potent, thereby to give the sway, and the most disintressed whereby to give the Equity requisite to such a Negotiation; and the most obliged in Honour, as having been the occasion by an unforeseen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence of drawing the sword of all this part of <hi>Europe.</hi> But if they feared any propension in his Majesty to one party it was toward <hi>Spaine,</hi> as knowing how that Crowne (as it is at large recited, and acknowledged, in the preamble of the last Treaty between <hi>England and Holland</hi> had been the only instrument of the happy Peace which after that pernicious War we now injoyed.</p>
            <p>Therefore they were resolved by all their influence, and industry (though the profit of the War did now wholly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>down to the <hi>English</hi> Nation, and however in case of peace it was our Interest, that if any, <hi>France</hi> should be depressed to any equality, to labour that by this mediation <hi>France</hi> might be the onely gainer, and having all quiet about him, might be at perfect leisure to attend their project upon <hi>England.</hi> And one of these our Statesmen being pressed, solved all Arguments to the contrary with an oraculous <hi>French</hi> question</p>
            <q>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:60385:28"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Faut il que tout se fasse par Politique, rien par Amitie?</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>
               <hi>Must all things be done by Maxims or Reasons of State; nothing for Affection?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore that such an absurdity as the ordering of Affairs abroad, according to the Interest of our Nation might be avoided, the <hi>English, Sbotch</hi> and <hi>Irish</hi> Regiments, that were already in the <hi>French</hi> Service, were not only to be kept in their full Complement, but new numbers of Souldiers dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly transported thither, making up in all, as is related, at least a constant Body of <hi>Ten thousand Men,</hi> of his Majesties Subjects, and which oftentimes turned the Fortune of Battle on the <hi>French</hi> side by their Valour.</p>
            <p>How far this either consisted with the Office of a Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour, or how consonant it was to the seventh Article above mentioned, of the last Treaty with <hi>Holland;</hi> It is for them to demonstrate who were the Authors. But it was indeed a good way to train up an Army, under the <hi>French Discipline</hi> and <hi>Principles,</hi> who might be ready seasoned upon occasion in <hi>England,</hi> to be called back and execute the same Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, they would be trying yet what they could do at home. For the late proceedings of <hi>Parliament,</hi> in quashing the Indulgence, in questioning Ministers of State, in Bills against <hi>Popery,</hi> in not granting Money when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever asked, were Crimes not to be forgiven, nor (how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Conspirators had provided for themselves) named in the Act of General Pardon.</p>
            <p>They began therefore after fifteen Years to remember that there were such a sort of men in <hi>England</hi> as the Old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier Party; and reckoned, that by how much the more generous, they were more credulous than others, and so more fit to be a gain abused. These were told, that all
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60385:29"/>
was at Stake, Church and State (How truly said! But meant, how falsly!) That the Nation was running again in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Fourty One,</hi> That this was the time to refresh their antient merit, and receive the Recompence double of all their Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, and that hence-forward the Cavaliers should have the Lottery of all the Great or Small Offices in the Kingdom, and not so much as Sir <hi>Joseph Williamson</hi> to have a share in it.</p>
            <p>By this meanes they indeed designed to have raised a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil War, for which they had all along provided, by new Forts, and standing Forces, and to which they had on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> given all provocation if it would have been taken, that so they might have a <hi>Rase Campagne</hi> of Religion, Government, and Propriety: or they hoped at least by this means to fright the one party, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage the other, to give hence forward Money at pleasure, and that money on what title soever granted, with what stamp coyned, might be melted down for any other service or uses. But there could not have been a greater affront and indignity offerred to those Gentlemen (and the best did so resent it) then whether these hopes were reall, to think them men that might be hired to any base action, or whether as hitherto but imaginary, that by erecting the late Kings Statue that whole Party might be rewarded in Effigie.</p>
            <p>While these things were upon the Anvill the tenth of <hi>November</hi> was come for the Parliaments sitting, but that was put of till the 13th. of <hi>April</hi> 1675. And in the mean time, which fell out most opportune for the Conspirators, these Counsells were matured, and something further to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, that was yet wanting: The Parliament accordingly meeting, and the House of Lords, as well as that of the Commons, being in deliberation of severall wholesome Bills, such as the, present state of the Nation required the great Design came out in a Bill unexpectedly offered one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the House of Lords, whereby all such as injoyed any

And moreover to put the Crown in full securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, this Parliament had by an Act of theirs determined a Question which the wisdome of their Ancestors had never decided, that the King hath the sole power of the <hi>Militia.</hi> And therefore my Lord Keeper did by his patronizing this Oath, too grossely prevaricate, against two very good <hi>State Maximes,</hi> in his <hi>Harangue</hi> to the Parliament, for which he had consulted not the <hi>Astrologer,</hi> but the <hi>Historian,</hi> advising them first, That they should not <hi>Quieta movere,</hi> that is, said he, <hi>vvhen men stirre those things or Questions vvhich are, and ought to be in peace.</hi> And secondly, That they should not <hi>Res parvas magnis motibus agere:</hi> That is, saith he againe, <hi>vvhen as much vveight is laid upon a nevv and not alvvays nece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ssary Proposition as if the vvhole summe of affaires depended upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this Oath, it seems, was the little thing he meant of, being forsooth but a <hi>Moderate Security to the Church and Crovvn,</hi> as he called it, but which he and his party <hi>layd so much vveight on, as if the vvhole sum of Affaires did depend upon it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:60385:30"/>
But as to the <hi>Quieta movere,</hi> or stirring of those things or Questions which are and ought to be in Peace, was not this so, of taking Armes against the King upon any pretence whatsoever? And was not that also in Peace, of the <hi>Trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Position</hi> of taking Armes by his Authority against his Person? Had not the three Acts of <hi>Corporations,</hi> of <hi>Militia,</hi> and the <hi>Five Miles,</hi> sufficiently quieted it? Why was it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>stirred?</hi> But being stirred, it raises in mens thoughts many things more; some les, others more to the purpose.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Walter Tirrells</hi> Arrow grazed upon the Deer it was shot at, but by that chance kill'd King <hi>William Rufus;</hi> Yet so far was it that Sir <hi>Walter</hi> should for that chance shot be adjudged of Treason, that we do not perceive he underwent any other Tryal like that of <hi>Manslaughter:</hi> But which is more to the point, it were difficult to instance a Law either in this or other Country, but that a private Man, if any king in Christendom assault him, may, having retreated to the Wall, stand upon his Guard; and therefore, if this matter as to a particular man be dubious, it was not so prudent to <hi>stirre</hi> it in the General, being so well setled. And as to all other things, though since Lord <hi>Chancellour,</hi> he havein his Speech of the 15 of <hi>Feb. One thousand six hundred seveny six,</hi> said (to testify his own abhorrency) <hi>Avvay vvith that ill meant distinsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on betvveen the Natural and the Politique Capacity.</hi> He is too well read to be ignorant that without that Distinction there would be no Law nor Reason of Law left in <hi>England;</hi> To which end it was, and to put all out of doubt, that it is also required in this <hi>Test,</hi> to declare mens abhorrency as of a <hi>Traitorous Position,</hi> to take Armes against those that are Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioned by him, in pursuance of such Commission; and yet neither is the Tenour, or Rule, of any such Commission specified, nor the Qualification of those that shall be armed with such Commissions, expressed or limited. Never was so much sence contained in so few words. No Conveyan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer could ever in more Compendious or binding terms have
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:60385:31"/>
drawn a Dissettlement of the whole Birth-right of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For as to the Commission, if it be to take away any mans Estate, or his Life by force, Yet it is the Kings Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Or if the Person Commissionate, be under never so many Dissabilities by Acts of Parliament, yet his taking this Oath, removes all those Incapacities, or his Commission makes it not Disputable. But if a man stand upon his Defence, a good Judge for the purpose, finding that the Position is <hi>Traitorous,</hi> will declare that by this Law, he is to be Executed for Treason.</p>
            <p>These things are no Nicetyes, or remote Considerations (though in making of Laws, and which must come after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards under Construction of Judges, <hi>Durante Bene-placito,</hi> all Cases are to be put and imagined) but there being an Act in <hi>Scotland</hi> for <hi>Tvventy thousand Men</hi> to March into <hi>England</hi> upon Call, and so great a Body of <hi>English</hi> Soulde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in <hi>France,</hi> within Summons, besides what <hi>Forainers</hi> may be obliged by Treaty to furnish, and it being so fresh in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, what sort of persons had lately been in Commission among us, to which add the many Bookes, then Printed by Licence, Writ, some by Men of the <hi>Black,</hi> one of the <hi>Green Cloath,</hi> wherein the Absoluteness of the <hi>English</hi> Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy is against all Law asserted.</p>
            <p>All these Considerations put together, were sufficient to make any honest and well-advised man, to conceive indeed, that upon the passing of this Oath and Declaration, <hi>the vvhole sum of Affaires depended.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It grew therefore to the greatest contest, that has perhaps ever been in Parliament, wherein those Lords, that were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst this Oath, being assured of their own Loyalty and Merit, stood up now for the <hi>English</hi> Liberties with the same Genius, Virtue and Courage, that their Noble Ancestors had formerly defended the <hi>Great Charter of England,</hi> but with so much greater Commendation, in that they had here a fairer
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:60385:31"/>
Field, and the more Civil way of Decision: They fought it out under all the disadvantages imaginable: They were overlaid by Numbers, the noise of the House, like the VVind was against them, and if not the Sun, the Fire-side was all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in their Faces; nor being so few, could they, as their Adversaries, withdraw to refresh themselves in a whole days Ingagement: Yet never was there a clearer Demonstration how dull a thing is humane Eloquence, and Greatness, how Little, when the bright Truth discovers all things in their proper Colours and Dimensions, and shining shoots its Beams thorow all their Fallacies, It might be injurious where all of them did so excellently well, to attribute more to any one of those Lords than another, unless because the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> have been the more reproached for this brave Action, it be requisite by a double proportion of Praise to set them two on equal terms with the rest of their Companions in Honour. The particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Relation of this Debate, which lasted many dayes with great eagerness on both sides, and the Reasons but on one, was in the next Session burnt by Order of the Lords, but the Sparkes of it will eterually fly in their Adversaries faces.</p>
            <p>Now before this <hi>Test</hi> could in so vigorous an opposition passe the House of Peers, there arose unexpectedly a great Controversy betwixt the two Houses, concerning their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges on this occasion, The Lords according to their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Right, being the Supream Court of Judicature in the Nation, had upon Petition of Doctor <hi>Shirley,</hi> taken cognizance of a Cause between him and <hi>Sir John Fagg,</hi> a Member of the House of Commons, and of other Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peales from the Court of Chancery, which the Commons, whether in good earnest, which I can hardly believe, or rather some crafty Parliament men among them, having an eye upon the <hi>Test,</hi> and to prevent the hazard of its coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, presently took hold of, and blew the Coales to such a degree, that there was no quenching them.</p>

               <pb n="62" facs="tcp:60385:33"/>
In the House of Peers both Partyes, as in a point of their own Privilege, easily united, and were no lesse inflamed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Commons, and to uphold their own ancient Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction; wherein neverthelesse both the Lords for the <hi>Test,</hi> and those against it, had their own particular reasons, and might have accused each-other perhaps of some arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; The matter in conclusion was so husbanded on all sides, that any longer converse betwixt the two Houses grew im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, and his Majesty Prorogued them therefore till the 13th of <hi>October</hi> 1675, following: And in this manner that fatall <hi>Test</hi> which had given so great disturbance to the mindes of our Nation, dyed the <hi>second Death</hi> which in the language of the Divines, is as much as to say, it was <hi>Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The House of Commons had not in that Session been wanting to Vote 300000 l. towards the building of Ships, and to draw a Bill for appropriating the Ancient <hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage,</hi> amounting to 400000 l. yearly to the use of the Navy, as it ought in Law already, and had been granted formerly upon that special Trust and Confidence, but nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did that 300000 l. although Competent at present, and but an earnest for future meeting, seem consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and had it been more, yet that Bill of appropriating any thing to its true use, was a sufficient cause to make them both miscarry, but upon pretense of the quarrel between the Lords and Commons in which the Session thus ended.</p>
            <p>The Conspirators had this interval to reflect upon their own affaires. They saw that the King of <hi>France</hi> (as they called him) was so busy abroad, that he could not be of far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther use, yet, to them here, then by his directions, while his Armyes were by assistance of the <hi>English</hi> Forces, severall times saved from ruines. They considered that the <hi>Test</hi> was defeated, by which the Papists hoped to have had <hi>Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salls</hi> for that of <hi>Transubstantiation,</hi> and the Conspirators
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:60385:33"/>
to have gained Commission, as extensive and arbitrary, as the malice of their own hearts could dictate: That herewith they had missed of a Legality to have raised mony without Consent of Parliament, or to imprison or execute whosoever should oppose them in <hi>pursuance of such their Commission.</hi> They knew it was in vaine to expect that his Majesty in that want, or rather opinion of want, which they had reduced him to, should be diverted from holding this Session of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: nor were they themselves for this once wholy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verse to it, For they presumed either way to find their own account, that if mony were granted it should be attributed to their influence, and remaine much within their disposal, but if not granted, that by joyning this with other accidents of Parliament, they might so represent things to his Majesty as to incense him against them, and distrusting all Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Advice to take Counsel from themselves, from <hi>France,</hi> and from Necessity.</p>
            <p>And in the meane time they fomented all the Jealousies which they caused. They continued to inculcate <hi>Forty and One</hi> in Court, and Country.</p>
            <p>Those that refused all the mony they demanded, were to be the onely Recusants, and all that asserted the Libertyes of the Nation, were to be reckoned in the <hi>Classis</hi> of <hi>Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>13th.</hi> of <hi>October</hi> came, and his Majesty now asked not only a Supply for his building of Ships, as formerly, but further, to take off the <hi>Anticipation</hi> upon his <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The House of Commons took up again such Publick Bills as they had on foot in their former sitting, and others that might either Remedy Present, or Prevent Future Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs.</p>
            <p>The Bill for <hi>Habeas Corpus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That against sending men Prisoners beyond Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:60385:34"/>
That against raising Mony without Consent of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</p>
            <p>That against Papists sitting in either House.</p>
            <p>Another Act for speedier convicting of Papists.</p>
            <p>That for recalling his Mejestys Subjects out of the <hi>French</hi> service, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> And as to his Majestys supply, they proceeded in their former Method of the two Bills, One for raising 300000 l. and the other for Appropriating the <hi>Tunnage</hi> and <hi>Poundage</hi> to the use of the Navy.</p>
            <p>And in the Lords House there was a good disposition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward things of Publick Interest: But 300000 l. was so insipid a thing, to those who had been continually regaled with Millions, and that Act of Appropriation, with some others, went so much against stomack that there wanted only an opportunity to reject them, and that which was readiest at hand was the late quarrel betwixt the House of Lords and the Commons. The house of Commons did now more peremptorily then ever, oppose the Lords Jurisdiction in Appeals: The Lords on the otherside were resolved not to depart from so essentiall a Priviledge and Authority, but to proceed in the Exercise of it: So that this Dispute was raised to a greater Ardure and Contention then ever, and there appeared no way of accomodation. Hereupon the Lords were in consultation for an Addresse to his Majesty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teining many weighty Reasons for his Majestyes dissolving this Parliament, deduced from the nature and behaviour of the present House of Commons: But his Majesty, although the transaction between the two Houses was at present be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come impracticable, Judging that this House might at some other time be of use to him, chose only to Prorogue the Parliament; The blame of it was not onely laid, but aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, upon those in both Houses, but especially on the Lords-House, who had most vigorously opposed the <hi>French</hi> and Popish-Jnterest. But those who were present at the Lords, and observed the conduct of the Great Ministers
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:60385:34"/>
there, conceived of it otherwise; And as to the House of Commons, who in the heat of the Contest, had Voted,</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>That vvhosoever shall Sollicity or prosecute any Appeal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any Commoner of</hi> England, <hi>from any Court of Equity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the House of Lords, shall be deemed and taken abetrayer of the Rights and Liberties of the Commons of</hi> England, <hi>and shall be proceeded against accordingly.</hi>
               </p>
            </q>
            <p>Their Speaker, going thorow <hi>VVestminster Hall</hi> to the House, and looking down upon some of those Lawyers, commanded his Mace to seize them and led them up Priso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with him, which it is presumed, that he being of his Majesties Privie Councill, would not have done, but for what some men call his Majesties <hi>Service;</hi> And yet it was the highest, this, of all the Provocations which the Lords had received in this Controversie. But however, this fault ought to be divided, there was a greater committed in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roguing the Parliament, from the 22th. of <hi>November</hi> 1675, unto the 15th, of <hi>February</hi> 1676. And holding it after that dismission, there being no Record of any such thing done since the being of Parliaments in <hi>England,</hi> and the whole Reason of Law no lesse then the Practise and Custome hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Contrary.</p>
            <p>This vast space betwixt the meetings of Parliament can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not more properly be filled up, then with the coherence of those things abroad and at home, that those that are intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent may observe whether the Conspirators found any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, or did not rather sute this event also to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of their Counsells. The Earl of <hi>Northampton</hi> is not to be esteemed as one engaged in those Counsells, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a person of too great Honour, though the advanceing of him to be <hi>Constable of the Tovver,</hi> was the first of our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mestick occurrents. But if they could have any hand in it,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:60385:35"/>
'tis more probable that lest he might perceive their Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, they apparelled him in so much Wall to have made him insensible. However men conjectured even then by the Quality of the Keeper, that he was not to be disparaged with any mean and vulgar Prisoners. But another thing was all along very remarkable, That during this Inter-Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, there were five Judges places either fell, or were made vacant, (for it was some while before that Sir. <hi>Francis North</hi> had been created Lord Cheif Justice of the Common Pleas) the five that succeeded, were Sir <hi>Richard Rainsford,</hi> Lord Chief Justice of the <hi>Kings Bench. Mountagne,</hi> Lord Chief Baron of the Exchequer. <hi>Vere Bartie,</hi> Barrister at Law, one of the Barrons of the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> Sir <hi>William Scroggs,</hi> one of the Justices of the <hi>Common Pleas.</hi> And <hi>Sir Thomas Jones,</hi> one of the Justices of the <hi>Kings Bench.</hi> Concerning all whom there it somthing too much to be said; and it is not out of a figure of speech, but for meer reverence of their Profession that I thus passe it over, considering also humane infirmity, and that they are all by their Pattens, <hi>Durante Bene Placito,</hi> bound as it were to the Good Behaviour. And it is a shame to think what triviall, and to say the best of them, obscure persons have and do stand next in prospect, to come and sit by them. Justice <hi>Atknis</hi> also by Warping too far towards the Laws, was in danger upon another pretense to have made way for some of them, but upon true Repentance and Contrition, with some <hi>Almes Deeds,</hi> was admitted to Mercy; And all the rest of the Benches will doubtlesse have profited much by his, and some other example. Alas the Wisdom and Probity of the Law went of for the most part with good Sir <hi>Mathevv Hales,</hi> and Justice is made a meere property. This poysonous Arrow strikes to the very heart of Government, and could come from no Quiver but that of the Conspirators. What <hi>French</hi> Counsell, what standing Forces, what Parliamentary Bribes, what National Oaths, and all the other Machinations of wicked men have not yet
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:60385:35"/>
been able to effect, may be more compendiously Acted by twelve Judges in Scarlet.</p>
            <p>The next thing considerable that appeared preparatory for the next session, was a Book that came out by publick Authority, Intitled, <hi>Considerations touching the true vvay to suppresse Popery, &amp;c.</hi> A very good design, and writ, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leive, by a very good man, but under some mistakes, which are not to be passed over. One in the Preface, wherein he saith, <hi>The Favour here proposed in behalf of the Romanists, is not more than they injoy among Protestants abroad at this day.</hi> This I take not to be true either in <hi>Denmark,</hi> or <hi>Svveden</hi> and some other Countrys were Popery is wholly suppressed; and therefore if that have been effected there, in ways of prudence and consisting with Christianity, it ought not to have been in so general words misrepresented.</p>
            <p>Another is, <hi>P.</hi> 59, and 60. a thing ill and dangerous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly said, concluding; <hi>I knovv but one Instance, that of</hi> David <hi>in</hi> Gath, <hi>of a man that vvas put to all these straits, and yet not Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted in his principles.</hi> When there was a more Illustrious Example near him, and more obious.</p>
            <p>What else I have to say in passing, is, as to the Ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of his whole design; which is to bring men nearer, as by a distinction betwixt the Church and Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> a thing long attempted, but ineffectually, it being the same thing as to distinguish betwixt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the <hi>English</hi> Bishops, which cannot be seperated. But the intention of the Author, was doubtlesse very honest, and the <hi>English</hi> of that Profession, are certainly of all <hi>Papiest</hi> the most sincere and most worthy of favour; but this seemed no proper time to negotiate further then the Publick Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.</p>
            <p>There was another Book likewise that came out by Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, towards the Approach of the Session, Intitled, A <hi>Packet of Advise to the men of Shaftsbury, &amp;c.</hi> But the name of the Author was concealed, not out of any sparke of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Modesty,
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:60385:36"/>
but that he might with more security excercise his Impudence, not so much against those Noble Lords, as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Publick Truth and Honesty. The whole composi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is nothing else but an Infusion of Malice, in the Froath of the Town, and the Scum of the <hi>University,</hi> by the Prescription of the Conspirators. Nor, therefore did the Book deserve naming, no more then the Author, but that they should rot together in their own Infamy, had not the first events of the following Session made it remarkable, that the Wizard dealt with some Superior Intelligence.</p>
            <p>And on the other side, some Scattering papers straggled out in Print, as is usuall for the information of Parliament men, in the matter of Law concerning Prorogation, which all of them, it is to be presumed, understood not, but was like to prove therefore a great Question.</p>
            <p>As to matters abroad from the Year 1674, That the Peace was concluded betwixt <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Holland;</hi> the <hi>French</hi> King, as a mark of his displeasure, and to humble the <hi>English Nation,</hi> let Loose his Privateers among our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant men: There was thenceforth no security of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce or Navigation notwithstanding the publick Amity betwixt the two Crowns, but at Sea they Murthered Plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, made Prize and Confiscated those they met with. Their Picaroons laid before the Mouth of our Rivers, hoverd all along the Coast, took our Ships in the very Ports, that we were in a manner blocked up by Water. And if any made application at his Soveraign <hi>Port</hi> for Justice, they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solently bassled, except some sew, that by <hi>Sir, Ellis Leightous</hi> Interest, who made a second prize of them, were redeemed upon easier Composition. In this manner it continued from 1674, till the latter end of 1676 without remedy, even till the time of the Parliaments Sitting: so that men doubted whether even the Conspirators were not Complices also in the matter, and sound partly their own account in it. For evidence of what is said, formerly, the Paper at the end
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:60385:36"/>
of this Treatise annexed may serve, returned by some Members of the Privy Council to his Majesties Order, to which was also adjoyned a Register of so many of the <hi>English</hi> Ships as then came to notice which the <hi>French</hi> had taken, (and to this day cease not to treat our Merchants at the same rate.) And yet all this while that they made these intolerable and barbarous Piracyes, and depredations upon his Majestyes Subjects, from hence they were more deligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then ever supplied with Recruits, and those that would go voluntarily into the <hi>French</hi> service were incouraged, others that would not, pressed, imprisoned, and carried over by maine force, and constraint, even as the Parliament here was ready to sit down; notwithstanding all their former frequent applications to the Contrary. And his Majesties Magazins were daily emptied, to furnish the <hi>French</hi> with all sorts of Ammunition, of which the following note containes but a small parcell, in comparison of what was daily convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away, under colour of Cockets for <hi>Jarsy,</hi> and other places.</p>

            <p>Thus was the <hi>French</hi> King, to be gratified for undoing us by Sea with contributing all that we could rap and rend of Men, or Amunition at Land, to make him more potent against us, and more formidable.</p>

            <p>Thus are we at length arrived at this much controverted, and as much expected Session. And though the way to it hath proved much longer then was intended in the entry of this discourse, yet is it very short of what the matter would have afforded, but is past over to keep within bounds of this Volumn. The <hi>15th</hi> of <hi>February</hi> 1676 came, and that very same day, the <hi>French</hi> King appointed his March for <hi>Flanders.</hi> It seemed that his motions were in Just <hi>Cadence,</hi> and that as in a <hi>Grand Balet,</hi> he kept time with those that were tuned here to his measure. And he thought it a becoming <hi>Galant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie,</hi> to take the rest of <hi>Flanders</hi> our natural out work in the very face of the King of <hi>England</hi> and his <hi>Petites Maisons</hi> of Parliament.</p>
            <p>His Majesty demanded of the Parliament in his Speech at the opening of the Sessions, a <hi>Supply for building of Ships, and the further continuance of the Additional Excise upon Beer and Ale,</hi> which was to expire the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>June</hi> 1677, and <hi>recommended earnestly a good correspondence betvveen the tvvo Houses, representing their last Differences as the reason of so long a Prorogation,</hi> to allay them. The Lord Chancellor, as is usuall with him, spoiled all, which the King had said so well, with straining to do it better; For indeed the mischan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of all the Sessions since he had the Seales, may in great part be ascribed to his indiscreet and unlucky Eloquence. And had not the Lord Treasure a farre more effectual way of Perswasion with the Commons, there had been the same danger of the ill successe of this Meeting, as of those former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Each House being now seated, the case of this long Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation had taken place so farre without doores, and was of that consequence to the Constitution of all Parliaments, and the Ualidity of all proceedings in this Session, that even the Commons, though sore against their inclination, could not passe it over. But they handled it so tenderly, as if they were afraid to touch it.</p>
            <p>The first day, insteed of the Question, Whether the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:60385:37"/>
were by this unpresidented Prorogation indeed <hi>Dissolved;</hi> it was proposed, something ridiculously, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this <hi>Prorogation</hi> were <hi>not an Adjournment?</hi> And this Debate too, they Adjourned till the next day, and from thence they put it off till the <hi>Munday</hi> morning. Then those that had proposed it, yet before they would enter upon the Debate, asked, Whether they might have liberty? as if that had not been more then implied before, by Adjourning the Debate, and as if Freedome of speech, were not a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession of Right, which the King grants at the first opening of all Parliaments. But by this faintnesse, and halfe-counsell, they taught the House to deny them it. And so all that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was wrapped up in a cleanly Question, Whether their grand Committees should sit, which involving the Legitima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the Houses Sitting, was carried in the Affirmative, as well as their own hearts could wish: But in the Lords House it went otherwise. For the first day, as soon as the Houses were seperate, the <hi>Duke of Buckingham,</hi> who usually saith what he thinks, argued by all the Laws of Parliament, and with great strength of Reason, that this <hi>Prorogation</hi> was Null and this Parliament consequently Dissolved, offering more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over to maintaine it to all the Judges, and desiring as had been usuall in such Cases, but would not here be admitted, that even they might give their opinions. But my Lord <hi>Frechvvell</hi> as a better Judge of so weighty a point in Law, did of his great Courtship move, That the <hi>Duke of Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham</hi> might be called to the Barre, which being opposed by the Lord <hi>Salisbury,</hi> as an extravagant motion, but the <hi>Duke of Buckinghams</hi> proposal asserted, with all the <hi>Cecilian</hi> height of Courage and Reason, the Lord <hi>Arundell</hi> of <hi>Trerise</hi> a Peere of no lesse consideration, and Authority, then my Lord <hi>Frechvvell,</hi> and as much out of order, as if the Salt had been thrown down, or an Hare had crossed his way, Opening, renewed the motion for calling the <hi>Duke</hi> to the Barre; But there were yet too many Lords between,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:60385:38"/>
and the <hi>Couriers</hi> of the Honse of Commons brought up ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice every moment, that the matter was yet in agitation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, So that the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> had opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to appear with such extraordinary vigour, in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned both the Duke of <hi>Buckingham's</hi> person and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal, that as the Duke of <hi>Buckingham</hi> might have stood single in any rational contest, so the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> was more properly another Principal, than his Second. The Lord <hi>Chancellour</hi> therefore in answer undertook, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to make the <hi>Prorogation</hi> look very formal, laying the best colours upon it, after his manner when Advocate, that the Cause would bear (and the worst upon his Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents) but such as could never yet endure the Day-light. Thus for five or six hours it grew a fixed Debate, many ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing it in the regular method, till the expected news came, that the Commons were rose without doing any thing; whereupon the greater number called for the Question, and had it in the Affirmative, that the Debate should be laid aside.</p>
            <p>And being thus flushed, but not satisfied with their Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, they fell upon their Adversaries in cool blood, question<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing such as they thought fit, that same night, and the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row after, sentencing them, the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the <hi>Earl of Salisbury,</hi> the <hi>Earl of Shaftsbury,</hi> and the <hi>Lord Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> to be committed to the Tower, under the notion of Contempt, during his Majestyes, and the Houses pleasure. That Contempt, was their refusing to recant their Opinion, and aske pardon, of the King, and the House of Lords. Thus a <hi>Prorogation</hi> without President, was to be warranted by an Imprisonment without Example. A sad Instance and whereby the Dignity of Parliamens, and especially of the House of Peers, did at present much suffer, and may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably more for the future; For nothing but Parliament can destroy Parliament, If a House shall once be Felon of it selfe and stop its own breath, taking away that Liberty of speech,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:60385:38"/>
which the King verbally, and of course, allows them, (as now they had done in both Houses) to what purpose is it comming thither? But it was now over, and by the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, in the House of Commons, and the Force in the House of Lords, this Presumptuous Session, was thus farre settled, and confirmed; so that henceforward men begun to wipe their Mouths, as if nothing had been, and to enter upon the Publick Businesse.</p>
            <p>And yet it is remarkable that shortly after, upon occasion of a discourse among the Commons concerning <hi>Libells</hi> and <hi>Pamphlets,</hi> first one Member of them stood up, and in the face of their House, said, <hi>That it vvas affirmed to him, by a person that might be spoke vvith, that there vvere among them, thirty, forty, fifty, God knovvs hovv many, Outlavved. Another</hi> thereupon rose, and told them, <hi>It vvas reported too, that there vvere diverse of the Members Papists;</hi> A third, <hi>That a multitude of them vvere Bribed, and Pensioners.</hi> And yet all this was patiently hushed up by their House, and digessed, being it seems, a thing of that Nature, which there is no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to; which may very well administer, and deserve a serious Reflexion, how great an opportunity this House of Commons lost, of ingratiating themselves, with the Nation, by acknowledging in this Convention their invalidity to proceed in Parliament, and by addressing to his Majesty as being <hi>Dissolved,</hi> for a <hi>Dismission.</hi> For were it so, that all the Laws of <hi>England</hi> require, and the very Constitution of our Government, as well as Experience, teaches the necessity of the frequent Meeting, and change of <hi>Parliaments,</hi> and suppose that the Question Concerning this <hi>Prorogation,</hi> were by the Custom of <hi>Parliaments</hi> to be justified, (which hath not been done hitherto) yet who that desires to maintaine the reputation of an honest man, would not have layed hold upon so plausible an occasion, to breake company when it was grown so Scandalous. For it is too notorious to be concealed, that near a third part of the House have bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:60385:39"/>
Offices under his Majesty, in the Privy Councill, the Army, the Navy, the Law, the Houshold, the Revenue both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> or in attendance on his Majesties person. These are all of them indeed to be esteemed Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of Honor, but more or lesse according to the quality of their severall imployments under his Majesty, and it is to be presumed that they brought along with them some Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of their own into his service at first to set up with. Nor is it sit that such an Assembly should be destitute of them to informe the Commons of his Majesties affaires, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate his Counsells, so that they do not by irregular procureing of Elections in place where they have no proper interest, thrust out the Gentelmen that have, and thereby dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbe the severall Countreys; Nor that they croude into the House in numbers beyond modesty, and which instead of giving a Temper to their deliberations, may seem to affect the Predominance. For although the House of Peers, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their supream and sole Judicature, have an equal power in the Legislature with the House of Commons, and at the second Thoughts in the Government have often cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected their errours: yet it is to be confessed, that the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses there assembled, are the Representers of the People of <hi>England,</hi> and are more peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arly impowred by them to transact concerning the Religion, Lives, Liberties, and the Propriety of the Nation. And therefore no Honorable person, related to his Majesties more particular service, but will in that place and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty suspect himself, least his Gratitude to his Master, with his self-interest should tempt him beyond his obligation there to the Publick. The same excludes him that may next in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit from being Guardian to an Infant, not but there may the same affection and integritie be found in those of the Fathers side as those on the Mothers, but out of decent and humane caution, and in like manner however his Majesties Officers may be of as, sound and untainted reputation, as the
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:60385:39"/>
best, yet common Discretion would teach them not to seek after and ingrosse such different Trusts in those bordering Intrests of the King and Contrey, where from the People they have no Legall advantage, but so much may be gained by betraying them. How improper would it seem for a Privy Counsellour if in the House of Commons he should not justify the most arbytrary Proceedings of the Councill Table, represent affaires of State with another face, defend any misgovernment, patronize the greatest Offenders a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Kingdome, even though they were too his own particular enemies, and extend the supposed Prerogative on all occasions, to the detriment of the Subjects certaine and due Libertyes! What self denyall were it in the Learned Counsell at Law, did they not vindicate the Misdemeanours of the Judges, perplex all Remedies against the Corruptions and Incroachment of Courts of Judicature, Word all Acts towards the Advantage of their own Profession, palliate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull Elections, extenuate and advocate Publick Crimes, where the Criminall may prove considerable; step into the chaire of a Money Bill' and pen the Clauses so dubiously, that they may be interpret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> in <hi>Westminister-Hall</hi> beyond the Houses intention, mislead the House, not only in point of Law, but even in matter of Fact, without any respect to <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity,</hi> but all to his own further Promotion! What Soldier in Pay, but might think himself sit to be cashiered, should he oppose the increase of Standing Forces, the Depression of Civill Authority, or the Levying of Mony by whatsoever means or in what Quantity? Or who of them ought not to abhorre that Traiterous Position, of taking Armes by the Kings Authority against those that are Commissionated by him in pursuance of such Commission? What Officer of the Navy, but takes himself under Obligation to magnify the expence, extoll the mannagment, conceal the neglect, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease the Debts and presse the Necessity, ringging and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringging it to the House in the same moment, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senting
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:60385:40"/>
it all at once in a good and a bad condition? should any Member of Parliament and of the Exchequer omit to transform the Accounts, conceal the Issues, highten the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipations, and in despight of himself oblidge whosoever chance to be the Lord Treasurer; might not his Reversioner justly expect to be put into present Posession of the Office? Who that is either concerned in the Customes, or of their Brethren of the Excise, can with any decency refuse, if they do not invent, all further Impositions upon Merchandise, Navigation, or our own domestick Growth and Consump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if the Charge be but Temporary, to perpetuate it? Hence it shall come that insteed of relieving the Crown by the good old and certain way of Subsidyes, wherein no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was to be got by the House of Commons, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised this Foraine course of Revenue, to the great Grei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and double charg of the People, that so many of the Members might be gratified in the Farmes or Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>But to conclude this digression whatsoever other Offices have been set up for the use of the Members, or have been extinguished upon occasion, should they have failed at a Question, did not they deserve to be turned out? Were not all the Votes as it were in <hi>Fee Farme,</hi> of those that were intrusted with the sale? Must not <hi>Surinam</hi> be a sufficient cause of quarrel with <hi>Holland,</hi> to any Commissioner of the Plantations? Or who would have denyed Mony to continue the War with <hi>Holland,</hi> when he were a Commissioner of Prizes, of Sick and Wounded, of Transporting the <hi>English,</hi> or of Starving the <hi>Dutch</hi> Prisoners? How much greater then would the hardship be for those of his Majesties Houshold, or who attend upon his Royall Person, to forget by any chance Vote, or in being absent from the House, that they are his Domestick servants? Or that all those of the capacity abovementioned are to be look upon as a distinct Body
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:60385:40"/>
under another Discipline; and whatsoever they may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit in the House of Commons against the National Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est, they take themselves to be justified by their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, their hearts indeed are, they say, with the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and one of them had the boldness to tell his Majesty, That he was come from Voting in the House <hi>Against his Conscience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And yet these Gentlemen being full, and already in Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, are more good natured and less dangerous to the Publick, than those that are hungry and out of Office, who may by probable computation, make another Third part of this House of Commons. Those are such as having obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by what steps, or rather leaps and strides, others of their House have ascended into the highest Places of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, do upon measuring their own Birth, Estates, Parts, and Merit, think themselves as well and better qualified in all respects as their former Companions. They are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally men, who by speaking against the <hi>French;</hi> inveighing against the Debauches of Court, talking of the ill manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Revenue, and such Popular flourishes, have cheated the Countrys into Electing them, and when they come up, if they can speak in the House, they make a faint attaque or two upon some great Minister of State, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps relieve some other that is in danger of Parliament, to make themselves either way considerable.</p>
            <p>In matters of money they seem at first difficult, but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been discourst with in private, they are set right, and begin to understand it better themselves, and to convert their Brethren: For they are all of them to be bought and sold, only their Number makes them cheaper, and each of them doth so overvalue himself; that sometimes they outstand or let slip their own Market.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:60385:41"/>
It is not to be imagined, how small things in this case, even Members of great Estates will stoop at, and most of them will do as much for Hopes, as others for Fruition, but if their patience be tired out, they grow at last mutinous, and revolt to the Country, till some better occasion offer.</p>
            <p>Among these are somemen of the best understanding, were they of equal integrity, who affect to ingrosse all busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, to be able to quash any good motion by Parliamentary skill, unlesse themselves be the Authors, and to be the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men of the House, and for their naturall Lives to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue so. But these are men that have been once fooled, most of them, and discovered, and slighted at Court, so that till some turn of State shall set them in their Adversaryes Place, in the mean time they look Sullen, make big Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and contrive specious Bills for the Subject, yet onely wait the opportunity to be the Instruments of the same Counsells, which they oppose in others.</p>
            <p>There is a Third Part still remaining, but as contrary in themselves as Light and Darknesse; Those are either the worst, or the best of Men; The first are most profligate per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that have neither Estates, Consciences, nor good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, yet are therefore picked out as the necessary men, and whose Votes will go furthest; The charges of their Elections are defraied, whatever they amount to, Tables are kept for them at <hi>White Hall,</hi> and through <hi>Westminster,</hi> that they may be ready at hand, within Call of a Question: All of them are received into Pension, and know their Pay-day, which they never faile of: Insomuch that a great Officer was pleased to say, <hi>That they came about him like so many Jack davvs for Cheese, at the end of every Session.</hi> If they be not in Parliament, they must be in Prison, and as they are Protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves, by Priviledge, so they sell their Protections to others, to the obstrnction so many years together of the Law of the Land, and the publick Justice; For these it is, that the long and frequent Adjournments are calculated,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:60385:41"/>
but all whether the Court, or the Monopolizers of the Country Party, or these that profane the title of Old Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers, do equally, though upon differing reasons, like Death apprehend a Dissolution. But notwithstanding these, there is an hanfull of <hi>Salt,</hi> a sparkle of <hi>Soul,</hi> that hath hitherto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served this grosse Body from Putrefaction, some <hi>Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> that are constant, invariable, indeed <hi>English</hi> men, such as are above <hi>hopes,</hi> or <hi>fears,</hi> or <hi>dissimulation,</hi> that can neither flatter, nor betray their King, or Country: But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conscious of their own Loyalty, and Integrity, proceed throw good and bad report, to acquit themselves in their Duty to God, their Prince, and their Nation; Although so small a Scantling in number, that men can scarse reckon of them more then a <hi>Quorum;</hi> Insomuch that it is lesse difficult to conceive, how Fire was first brought to light in the World then how any good thing could ever be produced out of an House of Commons so constituted, unlesse as that is imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to have come from the rushing of Trees, or batterring of Rocks together, by accident, so these by their clashing with one another, have struck out, an usefull effect from so unlikely causes. But whatsoever casuall good hath been wrought at any time by the assimilation of ambitious, fact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious, and disappointed Members, to the little, but solid, and unbyassed Party, the more frequent ill effects, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of so unequall a mixture, so long continued, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrable and apparent. For while scarse any man comes thither with respect to the publick service, but in design to make, and raiso his fortune, it is not to be exprest, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery, and Lewdnesse, which upon occasion of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Parliaments, are now grown habitual thorow the Nation. So that the Vice, and the Expence, are risen to such a prodigious height, that few sober men can indure to stand to be chosen on such conditious. From whence also arise Feuids, and perpetuall Animosityes, over most of the Countyes, and Corporations, while Gentlemen of Worth,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:60385:42"/>
Spirit, and ancient Estates, and Dependances, see themselves overpowered in their own neighbourhood by the Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, and Bribery, of their Competitors. But if neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lesse any worthy person chance to carry the Election, some mercenary or corrupt Sheriffe makes a double Return, and so the Cause is handed to the Committee of Elections, who aske no better, but are ready to adopt his Adversary into the House if he be not Legitimate. And if the Gentleman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grieved seek his Remedy against the Sheriffe in <hi>Westminster-</hi>Hall, and the proofes be so palpable, that the Kings Bench cannot invent how to do him injustice, yet the major part of the twelve Judges, shall upon better consideration vacate the Sheriffs Fine, and reverse the Judgement; but those of them that dare dissent from their Brethren are in danger to be turned off the Bench without any cause assigned. While men therefore care not thus, how they get into the House of Commons, neither can it be expected that they should make any conscience of what they do there, but they are onely intent how to reimburse themselves (if their Elections were at their own charge) or how to bargine their Votes for a Place, or a Pension. They list themselves streightways into some Court faction, and it is as well known among them, to what Lord each of them retaine, as when formerly they wore Coates, and Badges. By this long haunting so together they are grown too so familiar among themselves, that all reverence of their own Assembly is lost, that they live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether not like Parliament men, but like so many Good fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, met together in a Publick House to make merry. And which is yet worse, by being so throughly acquainted, they understand their Number and Party, so that the use of so publick a Counsel is frustrated, there is no place for delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, no perswading by reason, but they can see one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Votes through both Throats and Cravats before they hear them.</p>
            <p>Where the Cards are so well known, they are only fit for
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:60385:42"/>
a Cheat and no fair Gamster, but would throw them under the Table.</p>
            <p>Hereby it is that their House hath lost all the antient weight and authority, and being conscious of their own guilt and weakness, dare not adventure, as heretofore, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaching of any man before the Lords, for the most hainous Crimes of State, and the most Publick Misdemeanours; up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which confidence it is, that the Conspirators have so long presumed, and gone unpunished. For although the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spirators have sometimes (that this House might appear still necessary to the People, and to make the money more glib) yeelded that even their own Names should be tossed among them, and Grievances be talked of, yet at the same time they have been so prevalent as to hinder any Effect, and if the House has Emancipated itself beyond Instructions, then by Chastizing them with <hi>Proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations,</hi> frighting them with <hi>Dissolution,</hi> comforting them with long, frequent, and seasonable <hi>Adjournments,</hi> now by suspending, or diminishing their pensions, then again by increasing them, sometimes by a scorn, and otherwhiles by a favour, there hath a way been found to reduce them again under discipline. All these things and more being considered and how doubtful a foot this Long Parliament now stood up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by this long <hi>Prorogation,</hi> there could not have been a more Legal, or however no more wise and honest a thing done, then for both the Lords and Commons to have separated themselves, or have besought his Majesty to that purpose, left the Conspirators should any longer shelter and carry on their design against the Government and Religion, under this sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of <hi>Parliamentary Authority.</hi> But it was otherwise order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of which it is now time to relate the Consequences.</p>
            <p>The four Lords having thus been committed, it cannot properly be said that the House of Peers was thence forward under the Government of the Lord <hi>Frechvvel,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Trerise</hi> but those two noble Peers had of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:60385:43"/>
no small Influence upon the Counsels of that House, (having hoped ere this to have made their way also into his Majesties Privy Council) and all things fell out as they could have wished, if under their own direction. For most of them, who had been the most active formerly in the Publick Interest, sate mute in the House, whether, as is probable out of reverence to their two Persons, and confidence in their wisdom, they left all to their Conduct, and gave them a general Proxy, or whether, as some would have it, they were sullen at the Commitment of of the four Lords, and by reason of that, or the <hi>Prorogation,</hi> began now to think the Parliament, or their House to be <hi>Non Compos.</hi> But now therefore Doctor <hi>Cary,</hi> a Commner, was brought to the Barre before them, and questioned concerning a written Book which it seems he had carried to be printed, treating of the Illegality of this <hi>Prorogation,</hi> and because he satisfyed them not in some Interrogatories, which no man would in Common honour to others, or in self preservation, as neither was he in Law bound to have answered, they therefore <hi>Fined</hi> him a thousand pounds, under that new Notion of Contempt, when no other Crime would do it, and senten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to continue close Prisoner in the <hi>Tovver</hi> until pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Yet the Commons were in so admirable good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (having been conjured by the charming Eloquence of the Lord Chancellor, to avoid all misunderstanding between the two Houses) that their could no Member, or time, be found in all the session, to offer their House his Petition; much lesse would that breach upon the whole Parliament; by imprisoning the Lords, for using their liberty of speech, be entertained by them upon motion, for fear of entrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the priviledge of the House of Peers, which it had been well for them if they had been as tender of formerly.</p>
            <p>One further Instance of the Completion of their House, at that season, may be sufficient. One Master <hi>Harrington,</hi> had before the Session been Committed Close Prisoner (for
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:60385:43"/>
that was now the mode, as though the Earl of <hi>Norhampton,</hi> would not otherwise have kept him Close enough) by Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the King and Councill, the Warrant bearing <hi>for sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ornation of Perjury, tending to the Defamation of his Majesty, and his Government, and for Contemptuously Declaring, he vvould not ansvver his Majesty any Question, vvhich his Majesty, or his Privy Councill should aske him.</hi> As this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was hurried along to the <hi>Tovver,</hi> he was so dexterous as to convey into a friends hand passing by, a Blanke Paper onely with his name, that a Petition might be written above it, to be presented to the House of Commons, without reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for want of his own hand in the subscription. His Case notwithstanding the Warrant was thus.</p>
            <p>He had met with two <hi>Scotch</hi> souldiers in Town returned from <hi>Flanders,</hi> who complained that many of their Countrey men had in <hi>Scotland</hi> been seised by force, to be carried over into the <hi>French</hi> service, had been detained in the Publick prisons till an oportunity to transport them: were heaved on board fast tyed and bound like malefactors, some of them struggling and contesting it, were cast into the Sea, or maimed, in conclusion an intolerable violence and barbarity used to compell them and this near the present session of Parliament. Hereupon this Gentleman considering how oft the House of Commons had addressed to his Majesty and framed an Act for recalling his Majesties Subjects out of the <hi>French</hi> service, as also that his Majesty had i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>ued his Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation to the same purpose, thought he might do a good and acceptable thing in giving information of it to the House as time served, But withall knowing how witnesses might possibly be taken off, he for his own greater security took them before a Master of Chancery, where they comfirmed by Oath the same things they had told him. But hereupon he was brought before his Majesty, and the Privy Councill, where he declared this matter but being here asked by the Lord Chancellour some insnaring and improper questions,
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:60385:44"/>
he modestly, as those that were by affirmed, desired to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>us. This was the subornation of Perjury, and this the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to his Majesty, for which he was made Close Prisoner. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap>pon his Petition to the House of Commons he was sent for, and called in, where he is reported to have given a very clear account of the whole matter, and of his behaviour at the Council board. But of the two <hi>Scotch</hi> soldiers the one made himself perjured without being suborned by <hi>Harring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> denying or misrepresenting to the House what he had sworn formerly. And the other, the honester fellow it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

               </gap> House was inclined, and ready to have concerned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves for his Liberty. But Master Secretary <hi>Williamson</hi> stood <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> having been a Principal Instrument in commiting him, and because the other crimes rather deserved Thanks and Commendation, and the Warrant would not Justify it self, he insisted upon his strange demeanour toward his Majesty, decipherd his very looks, how truly it matters not, and but that his Majesty and the House remained still living Flesh and Blood, it might have been imagined by his discourse that Master <hi>Harrington</hi> had the Head of a <hi>Gorgon.</hi> But this story so wrought with, and amazed the Commons, that Mr. <hi>Harrington</hi> found no redresse; but might thank God that he escaped again into Close Prison. It was thought notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing by most men that his looks might have past any where but with a man of Sir <hi>Josephs</hi> delicacy. For neither indeed had Master <hi>Harrington</hi> ever the same oportunities
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:60385:44"/>
that others of practiting the <hi>Hocus Pocus</hi> of the Face, of Play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>French Scaramuccie</hi> or of living abroad to learn how to make the Plenipotentiary <hi>Grimass</hi> for his Majestys service.</p>
            <p>And now to proceed, rather according to the Coherence of the matters, then to the particular Date of every days action. By this good humour, and the House being so free of the Liberty of their fellow Commoners, it might be guessed that they would not be lesse liberal of their Monythis Session.</p>
            <p>The Bill therefore for 600000 l. Tax for eighteen month towards the building and furnishing of Ships easily passed without once dreaming any more of appropriating the Cust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omes. For the Nation being generally possessed by the Members with the defects of the Navy, and not consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at all from what neglect it proceeded, the House of Commons were very willing, and glad to take this occasion, of confirming the Authority of their sitting, and to pay double the summe that in the former Sessions they had thought necessary towards the Fleet; hereby to hedg in, and purchase their own continuance. And for the same purpose they ingrossed the Act with so numerous a list of Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, that it seemed rather a Register or Muster-roll of the Nation, and that they raised the whole kingdom to raise the mony. For who could doubt that they were still a lawful Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, when they saw so many gentlemens names (though by the Clerks hand onely) subscribed to an Act of their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king? Onely Mr. <hi>Seymour</hi> the speaker, would have dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed the number in his own Country. For he had entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Combination, that none should serve the King or their Country thorow <hi>Devonshire,</hi> in any capacity but under his approbation, and therefore he highly inveighed against ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Gentlemen of the best rank there, that ought him no ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, as persons disaffected, oppossing their names at a Committe of the whole House, before he heard them. But being checked in his careere, he let fall the contest, with as much judgment and modesty, as he had begun it with bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse and indescretion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:60385:45"/>
This Bill was not enough, but though the Nation had hoped to be relieved from the Additionall Excise upon Beer and Ale, which the Tripple League had foold them into, but was now of course to expire the <hi>24th</hi> of <hi>June,</hi> 1677. Yet a Bill for the continuing of it for three years more passed them likewise with little Difficulty. For the late fear of Disso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution was still so fresh upon them, that they would continue any thing to buy their own Continuance; and this Bill might considering their present want of Legality, have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly intituled, <hi>An Act for the Extraor dinary Occasion of the House of Commons.</hi> But that they might seem with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this tendernesse to themselvs not to have cast of all toward the People, they sunk all former Grievances into a Bill of Chancery, knowing well that a sute in that Court would be sooner ended, then a Reformation of it be effected; and that thereby they might gain work enough to direct the whole Session. And of their usuall Bills for the Liberty of the Subjects, they sent up only that of <hi>Habeas Corpus;</hi> pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and perhaps truly, that they durst not adventure them either in their own or the Lords House as they were now governed, lest they should be further ensnared by strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for freedome. But least they should trouble themselves too much with Religion, the Lords presented them with two Bills of a very good name, but of a strange and unheard of nature. The one intituled <hi>An Ast for securing the Protestant Religion by educating the Children of the Royall Family, and providing for the continuance of a Protestant Clergy.</hi> The other, <hi>An Act for the more effectuall Conviction and Prosecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Popish Recusants.</hi> And with these they sent down a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother for the further regulation of the Presses and sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressing all unlicensed Books, with clauses most severe and generall upon the subject, whereof one for breaking all Houses whatsoever on suspicion of any such Pamphlet where by Master <hi>L' Estranges</hi> Authority was much amplifyed to
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:60385:45"/>
search any other House with the same liberty as he had Sir <hi>Thomas Dolemans.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as to those two Bills of Religion, although they were of the highest consequence that ever were offered in Parliament since <hi>Protestancy</hi> came in (and went out of fashion) yet it is not to be imagined, how indisputable and easy a passage they found thorow the House of Peers, to the House of Commons; which must be ascribed to the great unanimity among them, after the committing of the four Lords, and to the Power of those two noble Peers, their Adversaries, which was now so established, that their sense being once declared, the rest seemed to yeild them an Implicite Faith and Obedience; and they were now in such Vogue, that whatsoever was spoken or done any where abroad in perfection, with great weight and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, men said it was <hi>A la Fraischeville.</hi> But if gentily and acutely, <hi>A la Trerise.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That Intituled, <hi>An Act for the more effectual Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Prosecution of Popish Recusants,</hi> is too long to be here inserted, and the Fate it met with, makes it unnecessary, for as soon as it was first read a Gentle-man of great worth and apprehension spake short but roundly and thorow against it.</p>
            <p>A second immediately moved that it might not onely be thrown out, but with a particular mark of infamy. And it being without any more ado ready to be put to the Questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a third demanded that they should stay a while to see whether there were any one so hardy as to speak a word for it. Which no man offerring at, it was forthwith rejected with this censure added to the Journal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:60385:46"/>
               <hi>And</hi> because the Body of the Bill was contrary to the Title, This unusual sentence of the House of Commons, though excusable by the Crimes of the Bill, yet was not to be justified by the Rules of entercourse between the two Houses. But because all men have hence taken occasion to accuse the Lords Spiritual, as the Authours both of this Bill and the other, it is necessary to insert here the true Fact in their just vindication. It was above two years ago that a select Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ball of great Ministers, had been consulting about Church matters, tho it seldom happens (nor did it in this instance) that the Statesmen are more fortunate in meddling with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, then the Churchmen with Government, but each marrs them with tampering out of their Provinces. This on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly difference, that what Ecclesiastical persons may do by chance or consequence, that harm the others commit on set purpose. For it was by these politicians, that these two <hi>Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>katrice Eggs</hi> were layd &amp; by their assiduous incubation hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is true indeed afterwards they took some few of the Bishops into Communication, and as it were for advice, upon what was before resolved. And to make this Bill go the better down, they flatterd them with the other, as wholy calculated forsooth to the Churches Interest. And by this means possibly they prevailed so far, that the Bishops both there and in the House, lesse vigorously opposed. But that the Bishopes were either the Contrivers or Promoters of the Bill, is a scandalous falshood, and devised by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors to throw the <hi>Odium</hi> off from themselvs upon the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and (the Bills that aimed at the ruine of the Church of <hi>England</hi> having miscarried) to compasse the same end by this defamation. A sufficient warning to the Clargy, how to be intrigued with the Statesmen for the future.</p>
            <p>The second Bill follows.</p>

                  <p>That when we were ingaged in a War, the <hi>Dutch</hi> would likely slip Collar, leave us in the War, and so Gain to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves the singular advantage of sole trading in Peace, which
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:60385:54"/>
is the Priviledge we now injoy, and should not be weary of.</p>
                  <p>That it was next to Impossible, to make Alliances with the several parties as might be expected, such and so various were the severall Interests, and crosse-biasses, of and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the <hi>Emperour,</hi> the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> the <hi>Dane,</hi> the <hi>Dutch,</hi> the <hi>Brandenburgh,</hi> and the severall lesser Princes of <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and others.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That we might easily enter into a War, but it would be hard to find the way out of it, and a long War would be destructive to us; for though the <hi>Emperour, French, Spaniard,</hi> &amp;c. use to maintain War for many years, yet a Trading Nation as <hi>England</hi> is, could not endure a long-winded War.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>On the other side, it vvas said;</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That they did not Addresse for making War but making Leagues, which might be a means ro prevent War.</p>
                  <p>That the best way to preserve Peace, was to be in a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pration for War</p>
                  <p>That admitting a War should ensue thereupon, as was not unlikely, yet that would tend to our peace, and safety in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion; for it must be agreeded, that if the Power of <hi>France</hi> were not reduced, and brought to a more equal Ballance with its neighbours, we must fight or submit, first or last.</p>
                  <p>That it was Commonly the Fate of those that kept them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves Neutral, when their Neighbours were at VVar, to become a prey to the Conquerour.</p>
                  <p>That now or never was the Crititall season to make VVar upon the <hi>French,</hi> whilst we may haveso great auxiliary conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; and if it were a dangerous and formidable thing to Encounter him now, how much more would it be so when this Opportunity was lost, the Consederacy disbanded, a Peace made on the otherside the water, and we left alone to withstand him single.</p>

That as to his seizing our Merchants Effects, the Case was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>That as to our Plantations and our Traders, we must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider, though the <hi>French</hi> was Powerful, he was not Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and we might as well defend them as the <hi>Dutch</hi> do theirs by Guards, Convoys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and chiefly when the <hi>French</hi> have so many Enemies, and we shall have so many Friends, as no other time is like to afford.</p>
                  <p>That they were sorry to hear we had not Ships, Stores, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> equal to the <hi>French,</hi> and to our Occasions, and hoped it would appear to be otherwise.</p>
                  <p>That the Season was not so far spent, but that a Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Fleet might be set out this Summer, and that however Deficient we might be in this kind, the <hi>Dutch</hi> were forward and ready to make an effectuall Supplement in that behalf.</p>
                  <p>That howsoever ill and false some men might esteem the <hi>Dutch,</hi> yet <hi>Interest vvill not lie,</hi> and it is so much their Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to confine and bring down the <hi>French,</hi> that it is not to be apprehended, but they will steadily adhere to every Friend and every Alliance they shall joyn with for that purpose.</p>
                  <p>That however cross and divers the several Confederates and their Interests were, yet a common Alliance may be made with them against the <hi>French,</hi> and aswell as they have Allyed themselves together, aswell may the Allyance be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to another, to be added to them, <hi>viz.</hi> the King of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That a Numerous and Vigorous conjunction against him is the way to shorten the work, whereas if he should hereafter attaque us singly, he would continue the War on us as long as he pleased, till he pleased to make an end of it and us together, by our final destruction.</p>

                     <pb n="106" facs="tcp:60385:55"/>
That if now we should neglect to make Alliances, we had no cause to expect to have one Friend, when the <hi>French</hi> should make Peace beyond Sea, and single us out for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest; for all that are conjoyned against the <hi>French,</hi> are provoked and disobliged, by reason of the Great Number of <hi>English, Scotch</hi> and <hi>Irish,</hi> which have served, and do still serve the <hi>French,</hi> and it was proved at the Bar of this House within this fortnight, That 1000 men were levyed in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and sent to the <hi>French</hi> service in <hi>January</hi> last, and some of them by force and pressing.</p>
                  <p>Also that it was understood and resented, that we had mainely contributed to this over grown Greatnesse of the <hi>French,</hi> by selling <hi>Dunkirk,</hi> that speciall Key and Inlet of <hi>Flanders,</hi> by making War on the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in 1665. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>French</hi> Joyned with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> under which shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and opportunity, the <hi>French</hi> lying layd the foundation of this Great Fleet he now hath, buying then many Great Ships of the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and obuilding many others: as to which, but for that occasion, the <hi>Dutch</hi> would have denyed and hindred him, by not observing the Tripple League, and by our making a Joynt War with the <hi>French</hi> against the <hi>Dutch,</hi> in which, the <hi>French</hi> yet proceeds and Tryumphs. So that in this respect we have much to redeem and retreive.</p>
                  <p>That enmnity against the <hi>French,</hi> was the thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in this divided Nation did unite, and this occasion was to be laid hold on, as an opportunity of moment amongst our selves.</p>
                  <p>That the bent and weight of the Nation, did lean this way, and that was a strong Inducement and Argument to Incline their Representatives.</p>
                  <p>That it had been made appear, and that in <hi>Parliament,</hi> that upon the Ballance of the <hi>French</hi> Trade, this Nation was detrimented yearly, 900000 <hi>l.</hi> Or a Million, the value of the Goods Imported from <hi>France,</hi> annually so much exceeding that of the Goods Exported hence thither, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:60385:55"/>
it is evident, that such a sum of the Treasure and money of the Nation was yearly Exhausted and carryed into <hi>France,</hi> and all this by unnecessary Wines, Silks, Ribbons, Feathers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The saving and retrenching of which Expence, and Exhaustion, will in a Great Degree serve to maintaine the Charg of a War.</p>
                  <p>That the present, was the best time for the purpose, and that this would give Reputation to the Confederates, and Comfort and Courradge to our bestfriends Imediately, and safety to our selves in futurity, against the <hi>Old perpetuall Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of England.</hi>

                  <p>The second Addresse was presented to his Majesty, <hi>March</hi> the 30. and till the 11 of <hi>Aprill</hi> they received no Answer.

                  <p>Somewhat was said on both these matters, but the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er debate of them, was Adjorned till next day, and then reassumed.</p>
                  <p>Then it was moved that the House should Adjorn till after <hi>Easter,</hi> and then meet again, with a Resolution to enable the King to make such preprations as should be thought neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary, and also passe some necessary Bills for the Kingdome, which if they did not, the blame of the neglect, must rest upon themselves, and it would be observed, they had not sat to any effect this four yeares; and that now they had a session, and had given a Million, they did take little care to redresse Greviances, or passe Good Laws, for the People, and that they should not be able to give any account of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:60385:56"/>
to their Neighbours in the Country, unlesse they should face them down, that there was no Greviance or Mischeife in the Nation to be Redressed, and that the King had stopped their mouths, and laid it to them by offering to them to sit longer.</p>
                  <p>Others said, they should perfect the two money Bills, and give the King Ease, and take another time to consider further of Religion, Liberty, and Property, especially see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Bills now depending, would be kept on foot, the Intended Recesse, being to be but an Adjournment, that they had very good Laws already, and would give their shares in any new ones, they were making, to be in the Country at the present time, that it was necessary for them to be there the <hi>10th.</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> to Execute the Act for 600000 <hi>l. &amp;c.</hi> And some time was to be allowed for their Journyes, and rest after it, that <hi>the passing some necessary Bills,</hi> came in the end of the Kings Message, and by the by; For his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty saith, <hi>That if for this Reason,</hi> that is, for making of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, <hi>&amp;c, they should desire to sit longer,</hi> and if so, then also take the opportunity of passing such Bills. So the sence and inclination of the House was to rise before <hi>Easter,</hi> as had been before intimated and expected.</p>
                  <p>Then they fell upon the main consideration of the Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sage, and to make a present Answer.</p>
                  <p>The Secretary and other Ministers of State, said, that the Alteration of Affaires which his Majesty took notice of, was the successe of the <hi>French</hi> against the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi> in the Battel, and their proceeding to take <hi>Cambray,</hi> and St. <hi>Omars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus by Inches or rather great measures they were taking in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:60385:57"/>
                     <hi>Flanders,</hi> which was reckoned the Out-work of <hi>England,</hi> as well as <hi>Holland)</hi> and they said plainely, nothing could put his Majesty in a condition to make fitting preparations to preserve the Kingdom, but ready money.</p>
                  <p>To this it was answered, that it was not proper nor usuall to aske money at the end of a Session, and it was fit that Alliances should be first made, and that they should Adjourn rather till that were done, for they ought not to give money till they knew for what, and it was clearely spoken and made out to them, that if there were no Summers War, there was money enough given already.</p>
                  <p>It was replyed, That they had not direction from his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty as to what he had resolved, and it might be not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to discover and publish such things, but they would offer their Guesse and Ayme at some things, if there were any Approaches towards War, though they ought to consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and compute like him in the Gospel, whether with such a force they could encounter a King that came against them with such a force, they should think of providing a Guard for the Isle of <hi>Wight, sersey, Carnsey and Ireland,</hi> and secure our Coasts, and be in a defensive posture on the Land, we might be Attaqued in a night.</p>
                  <p>Also there would be a necessity of an extraordinary Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Guard at Sea, his Majesty did use to apply 400000 <hi>l.</hi> vearly out of the Customes upon his Fleets, (the very har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour Expence) which in Anchorage, Mooring, Docks, and Repaires, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> was 110000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> and he was now set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth 40 Ships for the Summer Gard, but if there were a disposition towards War, there must be more Shipps or at least those must be more fully manned, and more strong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appoynted, and furnished the more, especially if the Breach were sudden, for otherwise, our Trading Ships at Sea, as well as those Ships and Goods in the <hi>French</hi> Ports, would be exposed. Now it is reasonable that the remander which was above and beyond the Kings ordinary Allowance,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:60385:57"/>
should be supplyed by the Parliament, and the Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary preparations of this kind for the present, could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to lesse than 200000 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was answered, that it was a Mealancholy thing to think <hi>Jersey,</hi> &amp;c. Were not well enough secured, at least as well as in the year 1665, when we alone had War with the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> too, and yet the Kings Revenue was lesse then than now: That the Revenue of <hi>Ireland</hi> was 50000 <hi>l. per annum,</hi> beyond the Establishment (that is, the Civill, Military; and all payments of the Government) which if not sent over hither, but disposed there, would suffice to defend that Kingdom, and they remember that about a moneth ago, they were told by some of these Gentlemen, that the <hi>French</hi> King would not take more Townes in <hi>Flanders</hi> if he might have them, but was drawing off to meet the <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> who would be in the field in <hi>May,</hi> and therefore it was strang, he should be represented now as ready to Invade us, and that we must have an Army raised and kept on our Islands and Land. No they would not have that, it would be a Great matter in the Ballance, if the Kings Subjects were withdrawn from the <hi>French</hi> service, and applyed on the other side, and tell that were done, that we did continue to be Contributary to the Greatnesse of <hi>France.</hi> But a Fleet would protect our whole. Ships are the defence of an Island and thereby we may hope to keep at a distance, and not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, or prepare to meet him at our Dores, he Learns by <hi>Sicily</hi> what it is to Invade an Island, he is not like to attempt an Invasion of us, till he hath some Masterie at Sea, which is Impossible for him to have so long as he is diverted and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed at Land in the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and in the <hi>West Indies,</hi> as he is.</p>
                  <p>And as to our Merchants Ships and Goods, they are in no more danger now then they were in any War when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever. Nay, there was more expectation of this, then there was of the last VVar, for the first notice we or the <hi>Dutch</hi>
                     <pb n="112" facs="tcp:60385:58"/>
had of that Breach, was the Attempt upon their <hi>Smyrna</hi> Fleet.</p>
                  <p>Also it is observed, that what was said a fortnight ago (that the season was too far advanced to lay in Be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>f, and it would stink) was admitted to be a mistake, for that now it was ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, that a greater and better appointed Fleet must be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished out, but still it was insisted on, that they were in the dark, his Majesty did not speak out, that he would make the desired Alliances against the growth of <hi>France,</hi> and resolve with his Parliament to maintain them, and so long as there was any coldness or reservedness of this kind, they had no clear grounds to grant money for preparations. His Majesty was a Prince of that Goodness and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">
                        <desc>•…</desc>
                     </gap>are, towards his People, that none did distrust him, but there was a distrust of some of his Ministers, and a Jealousie that they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>French Influences;</hi> and Complaints and Addresses had been made against them; and upon the discourse of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding for the safety of the Nation, it being said we might be secured by the <hi>Guarranty</hi> of the General Peace, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected on as a thing most pernitious to us, and that our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and endeavours could not be worse applied, than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure that Peace. Articles are not to be relied on. All that they desired was, that his Majesty and his People Una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimously, Truly, Sincerely and Throughly declare and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in this business, with a mutual confidence speaking out on both sides, and this, and nothing but this, would discharge and extinguish all jealousies.</p>
                  <p>But it was Objected, It was not convenient to discover his Majesties secret purposes in a Publick Assembly, it might be too soon known abroad, and there was no reason to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust his Majesty, but that being enabled, he would prepare and do all things expedient for the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>It was answered, That it was usual for Forraine Ministers to get notice of the Councils of Princes, as the Earl of <hi>Bristol</hi> Ambassador in <hi>Spain,</hi> in the last part of <hi>King James</hi>'s Reign,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:60385:58"/>
procured Coppies, and often the sight of the Originals of of Dispatches, and Cabinet papers of the King of <hi>Spain.</hi> But acknowledging that his Majesties Councels cannot be penetrated by the <hi>French,</hi> yet the things would in a short time discover themselves: besides they said, they did not much desire secresy, for let the King take a great Resolution, and put himself at the Head of his Parliament and People in this weighty and worthy Cause of <hi>England,</hi> and let a flying Post carry the news to <hi>Paris,</hi> and let the <hi>French</hi> King do his worst.</p>
                  <p>His Majesty never had nor never will have cause to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trust his People. In 1667, in confidence of our Aid, he made a League without advice of Parliament (commonly called the <hi>Tripple League)</hi> which was for the Interest of <hi>England,</hi> and whereby his Majesty became the Arbiter of <hi>Cristendom,</hi> and in the Name and upon the Account of that, the Parliament gave him several Supplies.</p>
                  <p>In 1672, He made War without the Advice, of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whith War the Parliament thought not for the Interest of <hi>England</hi> to continue, yet even therein they would not leave him, but gave him 1200000 <hi>l.</hi> to carry himself on &amp; out of it.</p>
                  <p>How much more are they concerned and obliged to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and assist him in these Alliances (and War if it ensue) which are so much for the Interest of <hi>England,</hi> and entered into by the pressing Advice of Parliament.</p>
                  <p>We hope his Majesty will declare himself in earnest, and we are in earnest, having his Majesties heart with us, <hi>Let his hand Rot off that is not stretcht out for this Affair,</hi> we will not stick at this or that sum or thing, but we will go with his Majesty to all Extremities.</p>
                  <p>We are now affraid of the <hi>French</hi> King, because he has great force, and extraordinary thinking men about him, which mannage his affaires to a wonder, but we trust his Majesty will have his Business mannaged by thinking men, that will be provident and careful of his Interest, and not
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:60385:59"/>
suffer him to pay, <hi>Cent. per Cent.</hi> more than the things are worth, that are taken up and used, and if the work be entred upon in this manner, we hope <hi>England</hi> will have <hi>English</hi> suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess with <hi>France,</hi> as it is in Bowling, if your Bowl be well set out, you may think, and it will go to the Mark.</p>
                  <p>Were the thing clear and throughly undertaken, there would be less reason to dispute of time; there never was a Council but would sit on <hi>Sunday,</hi> or any day for such Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Work.</p>
                  <p>In fine, they said, the business must lye at one door or another, and they would not for any thing, that it should flat in their hands.</p>
                  <p>And although they should hope in an Exigence his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty would lend to his People, who had given so much to him, yet they said they could not leave him without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding him a sum of money, as much as he could use between this and some convenient time after <hi>Easter,</hi> when he might, if he please command their full attendance, by some publick Notification, and this was the mentioned sum of 200000 <hi>l.</hi> The Expedient they provided for doing this, was adding a Borrowing Clause to the Bill for almost 600000 <hi>l.</hi> (such an one as was in the <hi>Poll Bill)</hi> the Effect of which is to enable his Majesty presently to take up, on the Credit of this Bill 200000 <hi>l.</hi> ready money at 7 <hi>l. per Cent. per annum</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest.</p>
                  <p>And this they said might now be done, though the Bill were passed by them, and also (save that they had made the above mentioned amendment) by the Lords, for that <hi>Poll Bill</hi> was explained by another Act passed a few days after, in the same session. But in <hi>Hackvvells Modus tenendi Parli. pag.</hi> 173, was a more remarkable President, and exact in the Point.</p>
                  <p>But after some Discourse of setting loose part of this 600000 <hi>l. &amp;c.</hi> they reflected that this 600000 <hi>l. &amp;c.</hi> was appropriate for the building of Ships, and they would not
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:60385:59"/>
have this appropriation unhinged by any means, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon resolved to annex the borrowing Clause to the Bill for continuing the additional duty of Excise, for three years, which was not yet passed; against which it was Objected, That it was given for other purposes, <hi>viz.</hi> to give the King ease to pay Interest for his Debts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But on the contrary it was answered, that the Preamble speakes not of his Debts, but <hi>His extraordinary Occasions;</hi> But besides, they did not intend to withdraw so much of their Gift, but did resolve to re-emburse his Majesty the 200000 <hi>l.</hi> so much of it as he should lay out in extraordinary Preparations.</p>
                  <p>But then it was Objected, that this would be a kind of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of War, and that 200000 <hi>l.</hi> was a miserable, mean and incompetent sum to defend us against those whom we should provoke.</p>
                  <p>But it was Answered, That it was but an Earnest of what they intended, and that they were willing to meet again and give further Supplies; Besides the <hi>French</hi> King was not For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable for any great hurt that he could do us during the Confederacy, there were several Princes of <hi>Germany,</hi> as the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Metz</hi> and <hi>Triers,</hi> the <hi>Palsgrave,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Nevvburgh, &amp;c.</hi> which are at War with him and are safe; and yet they are much more weak and inconsiderable than we; but they are defended not by their own strength, but by the whole Confederacy.</p>
                  <p>The Debate concluded in Voting the following Answer, which was presented to his Majesty by the Speaker of the whole House, <hi>Friday April</hi> the <hi>13th.</hi>

                  <p>There upon the House fell into present Consideration of an Answer, and in the first place, it was Agreed to return Great thanks to his Majesty for his Zeal for the safety of the Kingdome, and the hopes he had given them that
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:60385:61"/>
he was convinced and satisfied, so as he would speak and act according to what they had desired, and they resolved to give him the utmost assurance, that they would stand by him and said no man could be unwilling to give a fourth or third part to save the residue. But they said they ought to consider that now they were a very thine House, many of their Members being gone home, and that upon such a Ground as they could not well blame them; for it was upon a presumption that the Parliament should rise before <hi>Easter,</hi> as had been intimated from his Majesty within this fortnight, and universally expected since, and it would be un-Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, and very ill taken by their Fellow-members, if in this their absence they should steal the Priviledge of granting money, and the Thanks which are given for it; That this was a National business if ever any were, and therefore fit to be handled in a full National Representative, and if it had hitherto seemed to go up-hill, there was a greater cause to put the whole shoulder to it, and this would be assuring, animating, and satisfactory to the whole Nation. But they said it was not their mind to give or suffer any delay, they would desire a Recess but for three weeks or a moneth at most.</p>
                  <p>And the 200000 <hi>l.</hi> which they had provided for present use, was as much as could be laid out in the mean time, tho his Majesty had 600000 <hi>l.</hi> more ready told upon the Table.</p>
                  <p>And therefore they thought it most reasonable and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visable that his Majesty should suffer them to Adjorn for such a time; in the Interim of which his Majesty might if he pleased, make use of the 200000 <hi>l.</hi> and might also com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat the desired Alliances, and give notice by Proclamation to all Members to attend at the time appointed.</p>

And now the money Bill being Passed both Houses, and the <hi>French</hi> having by the surrender of <hi>Cambray</hi> also to them, perfected the Conquest of this Campagne, as was project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the mony for further preparations having been asked, onely to gain a pretence for refusing their Addresses, the Houses were adjourned <hi>April</hi> the 16th, till the 21 of <hi>May</hi> next. And the rather, becuase at the same moment of their rising, a Grand <hi>French</hi> Ambassador was coming over. For all things betwixt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>England</hi> moved with that punctual Regularity, that it was like the Harmony of the Spheres, so Consonant with themselves, although we cannot hear the musick.</p>
                  <p>There landed immediately after the Recesse, the Duke of <hi>Crequy,</hi> the Arch-Bishop of <hi>Rheims,</hi> Monsieur <hi>Barrillon,</hi> and a Traine of three or four hundred persons of all Qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, so that the Lords Spirituall and Temporall of <hi>France,</hi> with so many of their Commons, meeting the King at <hi>Nevv-market,</hi> it looked like another Parliament, And that the <hi>English</hi> had been Adjourned, in order to their better Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But what Addresse they made to his Majesty, or what Acts they passed, hath not yet been Published. But those that have been in discourse were,</p>

                  <p>But because it appears not that all these, and many others of more secret nature, passed the Royall Assent, it sufficeth thus far to have mentioned them. Onely it is most certain, that although the <hi>English</hi> Parliament was kept aloofe from

the businesse of War, Peace, and Alliance, as Improper for their Intermedling, &amp; Presumptuous. Yet with these 3 Estates of <hi>France</hi> all these things were Negotiated and transacted in the Greatest confidence.

                  <p>And for better <hi>Preparations</hi> at home, before the Parliament met, there was Printed a second Packet of Advice to the men of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> the first had been sold up and down the Nation, and Transmitted to <hi>Scotland,</hi> where 300 of them were Printed at <hi>Edenburgh:</hi> and 40 Copyes sent from thence to <hi>England</hi> fariely bound up and Guilded, to shew in what great Estmiation it was in that kingdome; But this, the sale growing heavy, was dispersed as a Donative all over <hi>England,</hi> and it was an Incivilty to have enquired from whence they had it, but it was a Book though it came from Hell, that seemed as if it dropped from Heaven, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, some Imagined by the weight and the wit of it, that it proceeded from the Two Lords, the Black and the White, who when their care of the late Sitting was over, had given themselves <hi>Caviere,</hi> and after the Triumphs of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> had Establish those Trophes of the <hi>Pen,</hi> over their Imprisoned Adversaries.

                  <p>The Parliament met according to their late Adjorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on, and from <hi>April 16th.</hi> to <hi>May,</hi> 21, 1677.</p>
                  <p>There was no speech from the King to the Parliament, but in the House of Commons.</p>
                  <p>This Meeting was opened with a verball message from his Majesty, delivered by Secretary <hi>Coventry,</hi> wherein his Majesty acquainted the House, that having according to their desire in their Answer to his late Message <hi>April</hi> 16th. driected their Adjournment to this time, because they did alledge it to be unparliamentary to grant Supplyes when the House was so thin, in expectation of a speedy Adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and having also Issued out his Proclamation of sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to the end there might be a full House, he did now expect they would forthwith enter upon the consideration of his last message, and the rather, because he did intend there should be a Recesse very quickly.</p>
                  <p>Upon this it was moved, That the Kings last Message (of <hi>April</hi> 16.) And the Answer thereto should be Read and they were read accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Thereupon, after a long silence, a discourse began a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout their expectation, and necessity of Alliances.</p>
                  <p>And particularly, it was intimated that an Alliance with <hi>Holland</hi> was most expedient, for that we should deceive our selves if we thought we could be defended otherwise, we alone could not withstand the <hi>French,</hi> his purse and power was too great. Nor could the <hi>Dutch</hi> withstand him. But both together might.</p>
                  <p>The general discourse was, that they came with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation to have Allyances declared, and if they were not made so as to be imparted, they were not called or come to that purpose they desired, and hoped to meet upon, and if
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:60385:63"/>
some few dayes might ripen them, they would be content to Adjorn for the mean time.</p>
                  <p>The Secretary and others said, these Allyances were things of great weight, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and the time had been short, but if they were finisht, yet it was not convenient to publish them, till the King was in a readinesse and posture to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secute and maintain them, till when his Majesty could not so much as speak out, insisting on his words, <hi>That vvithout</hi> 600000 <hi>l. it vvould not be possible for him to speak or Act those things vvhich should ansvver the ends of their several Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dresses, vvithout exposing the Kingdom to much greater dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By others it was observed and said, That they met now upon a publick notice by Proclamation, which Proclamation was in pursuance of their last Addresse, in which Addresse they desire the King they may Adjourn for such time, as with in which (they hoped) Allyances might be fixed, so as to be imparted, they mentioned not any particular day, If his Majesty had not thought this time long enough for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, he might have appointed the Adjournment for a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er time; or he might have given notice by Proclamation that upon this account they should re-adjourn to a yet long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er time.</p>
                  <p>But surely, the time has been sufficient, especially con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering the readiness of the Parties to be Allyed with; it is five weeks since our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>Neither is five weeks the limit of the time, that has been for this purpose, for it is about ten weeks since we first Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dressed for these Allyances.</p>
                  <p>And as to the Objection, That it was not fit to make them known before preparation were made, they said, the force of that lay in this, that the <hi>French</hi> would be allarmed. But they answered that the asking and giving money for this purpose would be no lesse an Allarm. For the <hi>French</hi> could not be ignorant of what Addresses and Answers have passed; and if mony be granted to make warlike preperations, for the end therein specified, it is rather a greater discovery and denouncing of what we intended against the <hi>French.</hi>

                  <p>Now the <hi>French</hi> King, is a vigilant Prince, and has wise Ministers about him, upon which general account (tho we had not as we have seen an extraordinary <hi>French</hi> Embassy here dureing our Recesse) we should suppose that the <hi>French</hi> King has demanded an account of our Kings purpose, and whether the extraordinary preparations that are begun and to be made are designed against him or not. In which case his Majesty could give but one of three answers.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To say, They are not designed against him, and then his Majesty may acquaint us with the same, and then there is no occasion of our giving money,</p>

                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:60385:64"/>
2. To say, They are designed against him, in which case his Majesty may very well impart the same to us. For it were in vain to conceal it from us, to the end that the <hi>French</hi> might not be allarmd, when it is before expresly told the <hi>French,</hi> that the design was against him.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To give a doubtfull answer. But that resolves into the second. For when a Prince out of an apprehension that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary preparations may be used against him, desires a clear categoricall and satifactory answer concerning the matter (as the manner of Princes is) a dubious answer does not at all satisfie his inquiry, nor allay his jealousy; But, in that case it is, and is used, to be taken and understood, that the forces are desined against him.</p>
                  <p>And if his Majesty have given no answer at all (which is not probable) it is the same with the last.</p>
                  <p>So that this being so, by one meanes or other the <hi>French</hi> have the knowledge of the Kings purpose, and if it be known to, or but guessed at by hem, why is it concealed from his Parliament? Why this darknesse towards us?</p>
                  <p>Besides we expect not so much good as we would, so long as we are afraid the <hi>French</hi> should know what we are a doing.</p>

                  <p>The Commons returning to their House, and the Speech being there read, they presently resolved to consider it, and after a little while resolved into a Committee of the whole House, for the more full, free, and regular debate</p>
                  <p>The Secretary and others propounded the supplying the King, wherein they said they did not press the House, but they might do as they pleased. But if it be expected that Allyances be made, and made known, there must be 600000 <hi>l<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

raised to make preperation before, for the king had declared that without it, it could not be possible for him <hi>to speak or Act;</hi> he could not safely move a step further. The king had the right of making Peace, War, and Leagues, as this House has of giving money, he could not have money with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them, nor they Allyance without him. The king had considered this matter, and this was his Judgment, That he ought by such a summe to be put into a posture to maintain and prosecute his Allyance, before they could or should be declared, and truely otherwise our nakednesse and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse would be exposed.</p>
                  <p>Tis true as has been Objected, the asking and giving mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney for this purpose, would allarm as much as the declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Alliance, but then it would defend too. A Whip will all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm a wild Beast, but it will not defend the man, a Sword will allarm the Beast too, but then it will also defend the man.</p>
                  <p>We know the King would strip himself to his shirt rather then hazard the Nation. He has done much already, he has set out, and made ready to set out, 44 Ships, but they must be distributed to several places for Convoys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their would need, it may be 40 more in a body. And it is difficult to get Seamen, many are gon into the service of the <hi>French, Dutch, &amp;c,</hi> The King is fain to presse now.</p>
                  <p>The King has not had any fruit of the 200000 l. credit provided him upon the three years Excise, he has tryed the City to borrow money of them, thereupon, and my Lord Mayor returned answer, that he had endeavoured but could not encourage his Majesty to depend upon the City for it.</p>
                  <p>Several others, somewhat different, spake to this effect. We should consider in this case, as in the case of the Kings Letters, Pattents, Proclamations, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If any thing in them be against Law and Reason, Lawyers and Courts, Judge is void, and reckon it not to be said or doneby the King. <hi>For the King can do no vvrong,</hi> tho his Counsel may. So we
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:60385:66"/>
must look upon the Kings Speeches and Messages as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Counsel, and therefore if any mistake be therein, it must be imputed to the error of his Counsel, and it must be taken that the king never said it. Now to apply certainly the treating and concluding of Alliances, requirs, not a previous summe of mony, however the kings Counsel may misin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. They may be propounded and accepted, by the meanes of the Forraign Ministers, even without an Embassy to be sent hence, and yet if that were requisite, it were not an extraordinary charg.</p>
                  <p>Allyances may be made forthwith, and then mony would be granted forthwith; If they were declared to day, the 600000 <hi>l.</hi> should be given to morrow, and as occasion should require.</p>
                  <p>And there is no fear but money would be found for this purpose, our own Extravagancies would maintaine a War.</p>
                  <p>The mony which has been provided the King already this Session, is sufficient for all Preparations that can possibly be made before these Allyances may be made.</p>

                  <p>We have made severall Addresses about some of the Kings Ministers, their management, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of which we have seen little fruit, Their have continually almost to this hour gone out of <hi>England</hi> succours to <hi>France,</hi> of Men, Powder, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, Ordnance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Not to take into the matter, how far the Ministers have been active or passive in this, nor to mention any other particulars, we must say that unless the Ministers, or their minds are altred, we have no reason to trust money in their hands, Though we declare we have no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to arrign or attempt upon them, but would rather pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose to them an easy way how they might have Oblivion, nay, and the thanks of the People <hi>viz.</hi> That they should en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour

It is a plain case, unless the power of <hi>France</hi> be lowred we cannot be safe, without Conjunction with other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, it cannot be done. The question is, whether the present be the proper time for th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     <hi>Philip</hi> the second of <hi>Spaine</hi> made an observation in his Will, or some last Memorial, and 'tis since published in Print by Monsieur, he observes the vanity of any Princes aspiring at the universal Monarchy, for that it naturally made the rest of the world joyntly his enemies, but ambition blinds men, suffers them not to look back on such Experiences. But this observation shews what is natural for others to do in such a case, and that the way to repell and break such a design, is by their universall confederation.</p>

                  <p>In the process of this debate, Gentlemen did more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly explain themselves, and propound to Address their design to the King, for a League offensive and defensive, with the <hi>Dutch</hi> against the <hi>French</hi> power.</p>
                  <p>Against which a specious <hi>Objection</hi> was made, That the <hi>Dutch,</hi> were already treating with the <hi>French,</hi> and 'twas like they would slip Collar, make a separate Peace for themselves and leave us engaged in a War with <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which was Answered, That there was no just fear of that, the <hi>Dutch</hi> were Interessed in repressing the Power of <hi>France</hi> as well as we, and they knew their Interest; It was reasonable for them to say, If <hi>England,</hi> which is as much concerned in this danger, will not assist us, we will make the best terms we can for our selves, there is yet a Seam of Land between the <hi>French</hi> and us, we may Trade by or under them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>They have observed a propensity in the People of <hi>England</hi> to help them, but not in the Couurt of <hi>England.</hi> If they can find that the Court does heartily joyn, it will above all things oblige and confirm them.</p>

                  <p>Which shews the proper course and practice, That Kings first communicate their Alliances made, before they demand Supplies upon the account of them.</p>
                  <p>So the Exception was let fall.</p>
                  <p>But the grand <hi>Objection</hi> mannaged against it, was upon the main point of the Address, wherein they desired his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty to make a League Offensive and Defensive with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and such other <hi>Alliances</hi> with the rest as he should think sit.</p>
                  <p>Those who were against this particular (or particularize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) in the Address, spoke to this effect.</p>
                  <p>This is an Invasion upon his Majesties Prerogative of making Peace, War and Leagues, and it is the worse for the Distinction that is used; in respect of the <hi>Dutch</hi> and the rest; by which you giving him express directions as to the <hi>Dutch,</hi> and referring to his discretion as to the others, it looks and gives an <hi>Umbrage</hi> as if what he was to do was by your leave.</p>
                  <p>The Antient Land-mark, the Boundaries between King and People must not be removed; This power is one of the few things reserved entirely to the Crown. Parliaments are summoned to treat <hi>de Arduis,</hi> but He, <hi>de quibusdam Arduis,</hi> this is unpresidented.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="140" facs="tcp:60385:72"/>
The Marriages of the Royal Family is such a peculiar thing reserved to the King, and the matter of the Lady <hi>Arrabella</hi> is an Instance. Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> resented it high, that the Parliament should propound her marrying, and she said that however it is well they did not name the person, if they had named the person, it had been intolerable, now here you name the person whom you would have the King Ally.</p>
                  <p>If you may go so far, you may come to draw a Treaty, and propose to the King to sign it, By this you would put a great <hi>Indecorum</hi> upon the King, he is now concerned as a Mediator at <hi>Nimmegen,</hi> and it would be an indecent thing for him at the same time to declare himself a party. It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the House of <hi>Austria</hi> (though they sent full powers to <hi>Nimmegen,</hi> for the purpose, yet) never intended to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Peace. But it was an absurd thing for them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare so in Publick; There must be publick decorum.</p>
                  <p>This is the way for the King to have the worse bargain with the Confederates, for they observing how he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portuned, and as it were driven to make these <hi>Alliances,</hi> will slacken and lessen those advantagious offers, which other wise they would be forced to make.</p>
                  <p>And again and again, they said his Majesty did agree with this House in the End, and they did not doubt but he would prosecute it by the same means as was desired. But his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative was not to be incroacht upon. This manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding would never obtain with the King, nay, it would make the Address miscarry with the King.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>On the other Side, several spoke to this effect.</hi>

Tis true (as <hi>Objected)</hi> that the Commons have sometimes declined advising in the matter of War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> proposed to them.

The very truth is, it has been the desire and endeavour of kings in all Ages, to engage their Parliaments in advising War, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That so they might be obliged to supply the King to the utmost for and through it, but they out of a prudent caution have some times waved the matter, lest they should engage further or deeper than they were aware or willing.</p>
                              <p>Since his Majesty is treating as Mediator at <hi>Nimmegen,</hi> about the general Peace, it is a great reason why he should specifi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                              <p>Doubtless the Confederates will offer honourable and worthy Terms; Their necessity is too great to boggle or take advantages, nor will they think this League the less worth because we advise it, but rather value it the more, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it is done unanimously by the King with the Advise and applause of his People in Parliament.</p>
                              <p>We cannot suppose that our proceeding thus to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty will pejudice our Address or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger its miscarriage since it is for his <note place="margin">Rush Coll. 171. 172, 177, 178.</note> Majesties advantage, in that it obliges us to supply him to all degrees through this Affaire, and the more particular it is, the more still for the Kings advantage, for if it had been more general, and the King thereupon had made Alliances, whatever they were, men might have thought and said they were not the <hi>Alliances</hi> intended, and it might be used as an excuse or reason for their not giving money to supply his Majesty here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after,

but this as it is now, doth most expresly, strictly and particularly bind us up.</p>
                              <p>We reflect that a great deal of time (and precious time) has been spent since and in our Addresse on this Subject, and finding no effectual fruit, especially of our last Addresse, we have cause to apprehend we are not clearly understood in what we mean.

                              <p>And said his Majesty in his late Message and last Speech, has been pleased to demand 600000 <hi>l.</hi> for answering the purpose of our Addresses, and assures us that the money shall not be imployed to other uses than we would have it imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is most seasonable for us to declare plainly the use and purpose we intend, that so it may be concerted and clearly understood of all hands, and therefore it is well done to mention to his Majesty these express Alliances, we thinking no other Alliances, worth the said Sum, and we withal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising and undertaking that his Majesty shall have this and and more for these ends.</p>
                              <p>Nor have we any cause to apprehend that his Majesty will take amisse our advising Leagues in this manner. We have presented more than one Addresse for Alliances against the growth and power of the <hi>French</hi> King, and his Majesty has received, admitted and answered them without any exception, and if we may Addresse for Alliances against a particular Prince or state, Why not for Alliances with a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Prince or state?

solemn debate set the same aside, it would beget a great doubt, discomfort, and discouragment to them; It is one thing never to have ordered it; another, to retract it.</p>
                              <p>Also it was said, that this was necessary, but was not all that was necessary, for suppose (which was not credible) that <hi>France</hi> should be prevailed with to deliver up all <hi>Lorraine, Flanders, Alsatia,</hi> and other Conquered places; Are we safe?

                  <p>Upon hearing of this Speech read, their House is said to have been greatly appalled, both in that they were so severe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Checked in his Majesties name, from whom they had been used to receive so constant Testimones of his Royal Bounty and Affection, which they thought they had deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as also, because there are so many Old and fresh Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidents, of the same Nature; and if there had not, yet they were led into this by all the stepps of Necessity, in duty to his Majesty and the Nation. And several of them offering therefore modestly to have spoken, they were interrupted continually by the Speaker, contesting that after the Kings pleasure signified for Adjornment, there was no further Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of speaking. And yet it is certain, that at the same time in the Lords House, the Adjournment was in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>pt down in the middle of the floor, all the House being astonished at so unheard of a violation of their inherent Priviledge and Constitution. And that which more amazed them afterwards was, that while none of their own transacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons or Addresses for the Publick Good are suffered to be Printed, but even all Written Coppies of them with the same care as Libells suppressed; Yet they found this severe speech published in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 word">

                  <p>In this manner was the second meeting of this, whether <hi>Convention</hi> or <hi>Parliament,</hi> concluded; But by what Name soever it is lawfull to call them, or how irregular they were in other things, yet it must be confessed, That this House or Barn of Commons, deserved commendations for have<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing so far prevented the establishment of Popery, by reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Conspiratours two Bills; Intituled.</p>

                  <p>But on the other side, that poor desire of Perpetuating themselves those advantages which they have swallowed, or do yet gape for, renders them so <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

                     </gap>bject, that they are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a meer property to the Conspiratours, and must, in order to their continuance, do and suffer such things, so much below and contrary to the spirit of the Nation, that any honest man would swear that they were no more an <hi>English</hi> House of Parliament. And by this weaknesse of theirs it was, that the House of Peers also (as it is in contigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Buildings) yeelded and gave way so far even to the shaking of the Government. For had the Commons stood firme, it had been impossible that ever two men, such as the Black and White Lords, <hi>Trerise</hi> and <hi>Frechvvel,</hi> though of so vast fortunes, extraordinary understanding, and so proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Courage, should but for speaking against their sense have committed the Four Lords (not much their inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours) and thereby brought the whole Peerage of <hi>England</hi> under their vassalage.</p>
                  <p>They met again at the Day appointed, the 16 of <hi>July,</hi> The supposed House of Commons were so well appayed, and found themselves at such ease, under the Protection of these frequent Adjournments, which seemed also further to confirme their Title to Parliament, that they quite forgot how they had been out-lawed in the <hi>Gazette,</hi> or if any sense or it remaind, there was no opportunity to discover it. For his Majesty having signified by Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventry</hi> his pleasure; that there should be a further <hi>Adjournment,</hi> their Mr. <hi>Seymour</hi> (the speaker deceased) would not suffer any man to proceed, But an honourable Member requiring modestly to have the Order Read, by which they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:60385:78"/>
Adjourned, he Interrupted him and the Seconder of that motion. For he had at the last Meeting gained one President of his own making for Adjourning the House with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out question, by his own Authority, and was loath to have it discontinued, so that without more ado, like an infallible Judge, and who had the power over Counsels, he declared, <hi>Ex Cathedra,</hi> that they were Adjourned till the third of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> next. And in the same moment stampt down on the floor, and went forth (trampling upon, and treading under foot, I had almost said, the Priviledges and usage of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but however) without shewing that decent respect which is due to a multitude in Order, and to whom he was a <hi>Menial servant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean time the four Lords lay all this while in the Tower, looking perhaps to have been set free, at least of Course by Prorogation. And there was the more reason to have expected one, because the Corn Clause which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted <hi>Communibus Annis,</hi> 55000 <hi>I.</hi> out of the Kings Cus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomes, was by the Act of Parliament to have expired.</p>
                  <p>But those frequent Adjournments left no place for Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, but that they must rather have been calculated to give the <hi>French</hi> more scope for perfecting their Conquests, or to keep the Lords closer, till the Conspirators Designes were accomplished; and it is less probable that one of these was false, than that both were the true Causes So that the Lords, if they had been taken in War, might have been ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somed cheaper than they were Imprisoned. When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore after so long patience, they saw no end of their Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, they began to think that the procuring of their Liberty deserved almost the same care which others took to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue them in Durance; and each of them chose the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod he thought most advisable.</p>
                  <p>The Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> having addressed in vain for his Majesties favour resorted by <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> the constant Residence of his Justice. But the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:60385:79"/>
Judges were more true to their Pattents then their Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and remanded him, Sir <hi>Thomas Jones</hi> having done him double Justice, answering both for himself and his Brother <hi>Tvvisden,</hi> that was absent and had never hard any Argument in the case.</p>
                  <p>The Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> the Earle of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and the Lord <hi>Wharton,</hi> had better Fortune then he in recurring to his Majesty by a Petition, upon which they were enlarged, making use of an honorable Evasion, where no Legal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration could be hoped for. Ingratefull Persons may cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure them for enduring no more, not considering how much they had suffered. But it is Honour enough for them to have been Confessors, nor as yet is the Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury</hi> a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr, for the <hi>English</hi> Liberties and the Protestant Religion, but may still live to the Envy of those that maligne him for his Constancy.</p>
                  <p>There remaines now only to relate that before the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed for the third of <hi>December,</hi> his Majesties Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation was Issued, signifying that he expected not the Members attendance, but that those of them about Town may <hi>Adjourn themselves</hi> till the fourth of <hi>April</hi> 1678. Wherein it seemed not so strange, because often done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as unfortunate that the <hi>French</hi> should still have so much further leisure allowed him to compleat his design upon <hi>Flanders,</hi> before the Nation should have the last opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of interposing their Counsells with his Majesty (it cannot now be said) to prevent it. But these words that the House <hi>may Adjourn themselves</hi> were very well received by those of the Commons who imagined themselves thereby restored to their Right, after Master <hi>Seymours</hi> Invasion; When in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal of this, he probably desiring to retain a Jurisdiction, that he had twice usurped, and to adde this Flower to the Crown, of his own planting, Mr. Secretary <hi>Coventry</hi> deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a written Message from his Majesty on the 3d. of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember,</hi> of a contrary effect, though not of the same vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:60385:79"/>
with the Proclamation, to wit, That the Houses <hi>should be Adjourned</hi> only to the 15. of <hi>January</hi> 1677. Which as soon as read, Mr. <hi>Seymour</hi> would not give leave to a worthy Member offerring to speak, but abruptly, now the third time of his own authority, Adjourned them, without putting the Question, although Sr. <hi>J. Finch,</hi> for once doing so in <hi>Tertio Charoli,</hi> was accused of high Treason; This only can be said, perhaps in his excuse, That whereas that in <hi>tertio Car.</hi> was a Parliament Legally constituted, <hi>Mr. Seymour</hi> did here do as a Sheriff that disperses a Riotous assembly. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they were kickt from Adjourment to Adjournment, as from one stair down to another, and when they were at the bottom kickt up again, having no mind yet to <hi>Go out of Doors.</hi>

            <p>And here it is time to fix a period, if not to them, yet to this Narrative. But if neither one Prorogation, against all the Laws in being, nor three Vitious Adjournments, against all Presidents, can Dissolve them, this Parliament then is Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, they can subsist without his Majesties Authority, and it is less dangerous to say with Captain <hi>Elsdon,</hi> so lately, <hi>Si Rebellio evenerit in Regno, &amp; non accideret fore, contra omnes tres Status, Non est Rebellio.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus far hath the Conspiracy against our Religion and Government been laid open, which if true, it was more than time that it should be discovered, but if any thing therein have been falsly suggested the disproving of it in any particular will be a courtesy both to the Publick and to the Relator; who would be glad to have the world convinced of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, tho to the prejudice of his own reputation. But so far is it from this, that it is rather impossible for any observing man to read without making his own farther remarkes of the same nature, and adding a supplement of most passages which are here but imperfectly toucht. Yet some perhaps may <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> as if the Assistance given to <hi>France</hi> were all along <hi>invidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously aggravated,</hi> whereas there have been and are, conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable numbers likewise of his Majesties Subjects in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of <hi>Holland,</hi> which hath not been mentioned. But in
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:60385:80"/>
Answer to that, it is well known through what difficulty and hardship they passed thither, escaping hence over, like so many Malefactors; and since they are there, such care hath been taken to make them as serviceable as others to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign, that of those three <hi>Regiments,</hi> two, if not the third also, have been new modelled under Popish Officers, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants displaced. Yet had the <hi>Relator</hi> made that volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Omission in partiality to his Argument, he hath abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly recompenced in sparing so many Instances on the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>side which made to his purpose; The abandoning his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesties own <hi>Nephevv</hi> for so many years in compliance with His and our Nations Enemies, the further particulars of the <hi>French</hi> Depradations and Cruelties exercised at Sea upon his Majesties <hi>Subjects,</hi> and to this day continued and tollerated without reparation; Their notorious Treacheries and Inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies, more especially relating to his Majesties Affairs. These things abroad, which were capable of being illustrated by many former and fresh Examples. At home, the constant irregularities and injustice from Term to Term, of those that administer the Judicature betwixt his <hi>Majesty</hi> and his <hi>People.</hi> The <hi>Scrutiny</hi> all over the Kingdom, to find out men of <hi>Arbitrary Principles,</hi> that will <hi>Bovv the knee to Baal,</hi> in order to their Promotion to all Publick Commissions and Imployments; and the Disgracing on the contrary and Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placing of such as yet dare in so universal a depravation be honest and faithful in their Trust and Offices. The defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of considerable persons both <hi>Male</hi> and <hi>Female</hi> to the <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Religion,</hi> as if they entred by Couples clean and unclean into the <hi>Ark</hi> of that Church, not more in order to their salvation, than for their temporal safety. The state of the Kingdom of <hi>Ireland,</hi> which would require a whole Volume to represent it. The tendency of all Affairs and Counsels in this Nation towards a <hi>Revolution.</hi> And (by the great Civility and Foresight of his Holyness) an <hi>English</hi> Cardinal now for several years prepared like Cardinal <hi>Poole</hi> to give us <hi>Absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Benediction,</hi> and receive us into <hi>Apostolical Obedience.</hi>

It is now come to the fourth Act, and the next Scene that opens may be <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Paris,</hi> yet men sit by, like idle Spectators, and still give money towards their own <hi>Tragedy.</hi> It is true, that by his Majesty and the Churches care, under Gods Speciall providence, the Conspiracy hath received frequent disappointments. But it is here as in Gaming, where, tho the Cheat may lose for a while, to the Skill or good fortune of a fairer Player, and sometimes on purpose to draw him in deeper, yet the false Dice must at the long run Carry it, unless discovered, and when it comes once to a great Stake, will Infallibly Sweep the Table.</p>
            <p>If the Relator had extended all these Articles in their par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Instances, with severall other Heads, which out of Respect he forbore to enumerate, it is evident there was matter sufficient to have further accused his Subjects. And nevertheless, he foresees that he shall on both hands be blam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for pursuing this method. Some on the one side will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, that the very Persons should have been named, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he onely gives evidence to the Fact, and leaves the male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors to those who have the power of inquiry. It was his design indeed to give Information, but not to turn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

That these to whom he hath onely a puplick enmity, no private animosity, might have the priviledige of States<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to repent at the last hour, and by one signall Action to expiate all their former misdemeanours. But if any one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the Chase, he is an ill Woodman that knows not the size of the Beast by the proportion of his Excrement.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, some will represent this discourse (as they do all Books that tend to detect their Conspiracy) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst his Majesty and the Kingdome, as if it too were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten against the Government. For now of late, as soon as any man is gotten into publick imployment by ill Acts and by worse continues it, he, if it please the Fates, is thence forward the Government, and by being Criminal, pretends to be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred. These are, themselves, the men who are the Living Libells against the Government, and who (whereas the

Law discharges the Prince upon his Ministers) do if in dang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of being Questioned, plead or rather Impeach his Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in their own Justification. Yea, so impudent is their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, that as they intitle him to their Crimes, so they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogate to themselves his Virtues, chalenging whatsoever is well done, and is the pure emanation of his <hi>Royal Goodness,</hi> to have proceeded from their Influence. Objecting thereby his <hi>Majesty,</hi> if it were possible, to the hatred and interposing as far as in them lies, betwixt the love of his People.
