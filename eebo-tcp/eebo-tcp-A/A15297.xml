         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Sowre dough is set also in good: whan Christe seyth, the rewme of heauens is lyke sowre dough &amp;c.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:20601:97"/>
For why, Paul seith. The fulnes of law is chariti. And in an other place The ende of law (that is perfection eyther, fyllynge of the lawe) is cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie of clene herte and of good co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and of feyth not feynyde. And Iesu Chryst seyth. Thou shalte loue thy lorde God of al thyne herte, and of al thy soule and of al thy mynde: and thy neighbour as thy selfe. For in thes two co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>deme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tis, hangith all the lawe and the prophetis. And as the rote of all euillis is couetyse: so the rote of al goodnes is charitie.</p>
               <p>Charitie by which we louen God and the neghbour: holdyth sykerlye al the greatnes &amp; largenes of Gods speachis. Therfore, if it is not leisure to seke al holi scripturs, to expowne al the wlappings of words, to perse all the priuities of scrypturis: holde thou charite wher al thyngis hang, so thou shalte holde that, that thou lernidest there. Also thou shalt holde

               <p>And in that that thou vndersto<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dist in scriptur: charitie is open, and in that that thou vnderstondysie not, chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie is hyd.

For why, hypocritis shoullen be seid to be not wyth Chryste, not onelye withoute<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> end: but also now, though they semen to bee in the Churche of Chryst.

               <p>To thys rule it perteyneth that the chirch seyth in songis of Songys: I am blacke and fayre, as the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles of Cedar, as the skynnys of Solomon. The Churche seyde that she is euereither for temporal vnitie

For the principall autour of holy write, is God him selfe. In whose powre it is not only to vse wordes to signifie a thynge as men done: but also he vsith thyngis signified by wordis to signifie other thyngis.</p>
               <p>Therfore by the signifiyng by wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis, is taken the litterall vnderston<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dynge either historiall of holy scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and by the signifiynge which is made by thyngis, is take<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the priuie either goftly vndurstondyng which is. iii. maneris.

By morall sence, it sig nifieth a faithfull soule. By whiche sense it is seyd in the. lii. Chapter of Esaie. Rise thou, rise thou, sitte thou Ierusalem. By sense Allegorike, it signifiethe the chirche fyghtynge a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yens synnis and fendis, by whiche sense it is seyde in the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one &amp; twentye of the Apocalips.</p>

                  <pb facs="tcp:20601:113"/>The fyrst rule is of our Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>su Chryste, and of his gostly bodye, whiche is holy chirche. For why, for knyttynge togidir of the heade to the bodie: holy scripture speakith some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyme of euereither vnder oo reasone, as vnder oo persone, and passith fro one to an other. In ensample, in. lxi. Chapter of Esaie it is seyde. He clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thide me wyth clothis of health, and he cumpassid me wyth clothingis of ryghtfulnes, as a spoule made fayre wyth a corowne, as a spousesse our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with hir brochis. For why, this that is seyde as of spouse, is vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stonden of Christe. And this y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> suith, as spousesse: is vnderstonden of holy chirche. Also in the fyrst Chapter of Songis, it is seyde. Kysse he me w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> the coss<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

<pb facs="tcp:20601:113"/>
for thy tetis. &amp;c. is y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> word of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> spouse preysyng the spouses. Wherfore in such things knite so togidir bi resone byfore seyde: a prudente readar o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weth to perceyue, what accordith to the heade, &amp; what to the dodye. The<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ii rule is of the verie body &amp; of the feynid body of oure Lorde Iesu Christ. For why holy chirch which is the gostly body of Christ, is a net which is not yet drawen to y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> brynk. Therfore it hath euel me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> medlyd w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> good men tyll to the dome, in which these shule<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> be departed fro hem. And therfore in holy scripture: euill men ben preised some tyme wyth good men, wyth the which they ben mede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. As in the. xi. Chapter of Osee, God seyth thus. Israell is a chylde, and I loued hym. And ayene warde sometyme good men ben blamed w<hi rend="sup">t</hi> euell men, as in the fyrst Chapter of Esay. An Oxe knewe his Lorde, and an Asse knew the cratch of his Lord

               <p>The fourth time, this rule falith, for y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> holy scripture speakith of thyng to coming, by y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> maner of thing passid. As in the. ix.

               <p>The. vi. rule is of recapitulation. That is of rehersing of thyngis done byfore. And of Anticipation either byfore takynge, that is settynge in of thyng byfore it is done.

Wherof it is open that this that is byfore seyde of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> departyng of lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagis, is seyde by Anticipacion. In like maner in. ii.

The. vii. rule is of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell &amp; of his body. For as Gregorye seyth in the tenth. Homelie.

And in the. xxviii. chapter of Ezechiel, wher the scriptur speaketh of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> prince of Tire it passith to speak of the deuil, when it is addid. Thou a signet eyther a printe of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> lykenes of God, were full of wysedome and perfecte in fayrnes, in the delicite of Paradise of God. Lire seyth al this in the seconde prologe of Genesis. Here Lire rehersyth the sentence of S. Austin &amp; of Isidre in these rulis:
<pb facs="tcp:20601:119"/>
and declarith hem openly by holye Scripture and reasone, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trith not Austin, but declarith hym full myche to simple mens wyt, and addith more by Scripture and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>e, y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> Austine touchith not. Though these rulis and keyes of Scripture bryngin men to greate vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding therof: yet men mote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> take hede what is seyde of Chryste of his godheade, and what by hys manheade. For Chryst by his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>heade, is seyd lesse than the father, and by the godhead he is sey de eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wyth the father. And for asmuch as Chryst is boeth God and man, we graunte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that God was deadly and dyed on the Crosse. Not by his godheade, but by the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>head of Chryste, that was ioyned in one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heade of persone wyth the godhead. And we graunt, as the Gospel doth that man whyle he was deadly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth: was in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, for his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heade was ther, &amp; he also by reasone
<pb facs="tcp:20601:119"/>
therof. Also we moun graunte well that a man made both heauen and earth. For Christe by his godheade, (which Christe is and was ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) dyd thus. Also holy Scriptur tellith oft the thoughtis of men and of the wor dis &amp; dedis. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the thoughtis &amp; wordis and dedis of men ben con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trari, oo Gospellar tellith y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, a nother tellith the wordis, and by this equiuocation either diuers speakinge, they bene accordid. Yea whan they semen contrarie in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis. Also ofte in storiall mattir, scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rehersyth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mone opinion of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and affirmeth not that it was so in dede. In this maner the Gospel seith that Ioseph was the father of Chryste: though he neuer gendrid Christ. For Mary Christis mother was euer clene virgine. Thus the Gospell seyth, that at the beheadyng of Iohn Baptiste, Herod was sorie, &amp; yet as doctours seyne, he was full

At the laste, take ye good hede whan the scripture speakith by commaundement to all men, &amp; wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it geueth commaundement to certen personnes of dyuers statis.
