         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For why, Paul seith. The fulnes of law is chariti.

For the principall autour of holy write, is God him selfe. In whose powre it is not only to vse wordes to signifie a thynge as men done: but also he vsith thyngis signified by wordis to signifie other thyngis.</p>

               <p>The. vi. rule is of recapitulation. That is of rehersing of thyngis done byfore. And of Anticipation either byfore takynge, that is settynge in of thyng byfore it is done.

Wherof it is open, that this is seyde: by reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulacion, either rehersyng of thing done bifore. The. vii. rule is of y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell &amp; of his body. For as Gregorye seyth in the tenth. Homelie.

And in the. xxviii. chapter of Ezechiel, wher the scriptur speaketh of y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> prince of Tire it passith to speak of the deuil, when it is addid. Thou a signet eyther a printe of y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> lykenes of God, were full of wysedome and perfecte in fayrnes, in the delicite of Paradise of God. Lire seyth al this in the seconde prologe of Genesis. Here Lire rehersyth the sentence of S. Austin &amp; of Isidre in these rulis:
<pb facs="tcp:20601:119"/>
and declarith hem openly by holye Scripture and reasone, and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trith not Austin, but declarith hym full myche to simple mens wyt, and addith more by Scripture and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>e, y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> Austine touchith not. Though these rulis and keyes of Scripture bryngin men to greate vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ding therof: yet men mote<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> take hede what is seyde of Chryste of his godheade, and what by hys manheade. For Chryst by his ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>heade, is seyd lesse than the father, and by the godhead he is sey de eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> wyth the father. And for asmuch as Chryst is boeth God and man, we graunte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> that God was deadly and dyed on the Crosse. Not by his godheade, but by the ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>head of Chryste, that was ioyned in one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heade of persone wyth the godhead. And we graunt, as the Gospel doth that man whyle he was deadly vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth: was in heaue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, for his god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heade was ther, &amp; he also by reasone
<pb facs="tcp:20601:119"/>
therof. Also we moun graunte well that a man made both heauen and earth. For Christe by his godheade, (which Christe is and was ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>) dyd thus. Also holy Scriptur tellith oft the thoughtis of men and of the wor dis &amp; dedis. And wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> the thoughtis &amp; wordis and dedis of men ben con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trari, oo Gospellar tellith y<hi rend="sup">â¢</hi> though<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, a nother tellith the wordis, and by this equiuocation either diuers speakinge, they bene accordid. Yea whan they semen contrarie in wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis. Also ofte in storiall mattir, scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture rehersyth the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mone opinion of me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, and affirmeth not that it was so in dede. In this maner the Gospel seith that Ioseph was the father of Chryste: though he neuer gendrid Christ. For Mary Christis mother was euer clene virgine. Thus the Gospell seyth, that at the beheadyng of Iohn Baptiste, Herod was sorie, &amp; yet as doctours seyne, he was full
<pb facs="tcp:20601:120"/>
glad therof. But he feined him sory<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> for the puple, &amp; the puple gessid hym sory. Also though scriptur do reherse how holime<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> liuiden &amp;, doth co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>mend hem grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1+ letters">

And thoughe scripture do tel the stories of euil me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> and dampnid, it repreueth not here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all thyngis which thei dide<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>.

At the laste, take ye good hede whan the scripture speakith by commaundement to all men, &amp; wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> it geueth commaundement to certen personnes of dyuers statis.
