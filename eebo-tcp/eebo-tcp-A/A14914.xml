            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Having found Generall <hi>Lonck</hi> with his ſhips in the Bay of St. Vincent, after wee had layen there ſome weekes till the reſt of our fleete came unto us, being in all fifty three ſayle, manned with many ſicke men amongſt the ſound ones; on the 26 of December 1629 laſt, we ſet forward for the Coaſt of Braſill; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the 12 of February following, wee ſayled on to the height of eight degrees, where ſome other of our ſhips and pinnaces came unto us that had beene loſt; ſo that then we were fifty ſixe ſayles in all: And having met all together in counſell, after mature deliberation wee ſent out ſome ſhips before to diſcover, and reſolved to aſſault the enemy in two places, to wit, I my ſelfe with 2400 ſouldiers, and 300 ſaylers. And beſides thoſe, other 300

               </gap>ded ſome ſix Engliſh miles to the Northward of Fernabuck; and the Generall to have along with him two other ſtrong ſquadrons, which ſhould put into the roade by the ſea banke or ſhelfe.</p>
            <p>Which reſolution was accordingly put in execution upon the 15 day of February laſt. But in regard thoſe of the Caſtle were warned, or ſuſpecting of our comming, and had therefore ſunke ſome ſhips in the very mouth of the ſhelfe, the Generall his deſigne could take no effect, though he did his beſt endeavour to open the paſſage in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſhelfe with his Canon.</p>
            <p>In the meane while a great number of the enemies both foote and horſe ſhewed themſelves in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noone upon the ſands, which made mee make for the ſhore with ſloopes and boates, where wee landed in the ſight and ſpight of them all; the reſt of our men follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me with two peeces of Ordnance, which carried a bullet of ſome three pound weight. And becauſe it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be late, I was conſtrained there to abide and lye on the ſands all that night. The next day very earely in the morning having ſent the boates and ſloopes backe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>againe to the ſhipping, I ordered my troopes into three diviſions. Firſt, the Avantgard, wherein I was preſent my ſelfe in perſon both in landing the day before, and then upon our march; and this Avantgard was comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by Collonell <hi>Eltz:</hi> The Battell was commanded by Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Steincallenfels;</hi> and the rereward by the Serjeant Major <hi>Huncks.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I led my ſelfe the Avantgard along the ſea ſhore to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the towne, and comming to the River called Rio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolce, the depth whereof is up to a mans middle, and which of neceſſitie wee muſt paſſe: There the enemie gave us the firſt encounter, being in my judgement ſtrong about 1800 foote and horſe; But after a hot onſet, and divers being flame and hurt on both ſides, (but thankes be to God the leaſt number on our ſide) wee put
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:20427:3"/>
them to flight; notwithſtanding they had this advantage of us of a ſwift running water. Thus being paſt and a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further advanced on the ſands, we met with a ſecond troope, who likewiſe made a tryall of our reſolution, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulting us with a brave skirmiſh, and wee encountring them with a great deſire; but after a little reſiſtance they made their retreate into the woods. A third time the enemies ſhewed themſelves againe, but would or durſt no more ſtand againſt us. I then perceiving this feare and irreſolution amongſt them, marched in all dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence directly towards the towne, and being come neer to it, we climed up to the height of the hill whereupon ſtands the Cloyſter of the Ieſuites, and there finding the gates thereof barrocadoed, we fell on and broke them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, while part of our enemies defended themſelves with their weapons, and part runne away: ſo the others alſo ſeeing the courage of our men, after ſome ſmall op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, they alſo fled, leaving behinde them many dead and hurt men, as alſo on our ſide there were ſlaine ſome.</p>
            <p>In the meane while our enemies beneath on the ſands, and in the trenches and forts perceiving this our procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and being now alſo ſet upon and preſt by our <hi>Reere,</hi> which entertained a fight with them, after many Canon ſhots made by ours againſt them, betooke themſelves at laſt to their heeles, abandoning their Forts, which we preſently tooke and poſſeſſed our ſelves thereof.</p>
            <p>Thus by the aſſiſtance of God we became maſters of the towne, after we had loſt by reaſon of the great heate in the fight about 50 or 60 ſouldiers in all. The Ieſuites cloiſter wherein I my ſelfe lye, and ſome other avenues and paſſages, wee preſently fortified againſt any aſſaults that the enemie could make upon us. The 20 of February laſt I commanded Colonell <hi>Steincallenfels,</hi> with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the councell, to ſee if he could ſurpriſe the great fort that lieth upon the ſhelfe on the land ſide And truly he carried himſelfe bravely, and gave an aſſault upon it
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:20427:4"/>
that laſted two houres together; but becauſe our ladders were too ſhort, it was thought good to prevent the ſpoyling of more men, to retreate after the loſſe of ſome 20 ſlaine and 40 hurt; the enemy having on his ſide alſo loſt ſome 12 that were ſlaine by ours. And ſeeing wee could not carry ſo eaſily that fort by an aſſault, vve reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on the 23 of February, to take it by approaches, and forthwith to cauſe Canon baskets and other neceſſaries to be prepared and ſet up. All which was done accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, and with ſuch an expedition, that on the 27 of the ſame moneth with 500 men wee began to breake ground and to runne a trench and a line towards the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, which ſtood betweene the village ſcituated upon the ſhelfe and the towne: And the next day Lieutenant Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Eltz,</hi> who commanded the battery, being almoſt in a readineſſe, hee was relieved that night by Serjeant Major <hi>Huncks:</hi> I alſo going thither in perſon, on the next morning very early the battery was finiſhed of 3 halfe Canon; we played all that morning, diſcharging 708 ſhot till about nine of the clock in the forenoon. Then the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged called for a parley, holding out a white ſheete, and ſending forth a Captaine, with whom wee preſently came to a compoſition, to wit:</p>
            <p>That they leaving the Fort to us ſhould march out without colours, or lighted matches; leaving behinde them all their ordnance, amunition and victualls that were in the Caſtle, which we ſuppoſe they caſt the moſt part of them into the Sea, becauſe we could finde but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in it; Beſides, that they ſhould binde themſelves by promiſe to ſhew no hoſtility againſt our ſtate in ſixe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neths after.</p>
            <p>This being done, wee ſummoned up alſo the other Caſtle, which ſtands upon the entrance into the ſhelfe.</p>
            <p>The Generall Admirall and Vice-Admirall being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſed thereof, and comming unto us, approved of the Councell, and ſo ſending a drumme unto the ſaid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, they within it preſently ſent out a Lieutenant (upon
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:20427:4"/>
condition of leaving one of ours as hoſtage in his place) who from the Commander thereof had order to treate with us, and to frame certaine articles or condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were ſigned on both ſides: And ſo this great fort being given over alſo unto us this day, we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came not onely maſters of both theſe forts, but alſo withall of the haven and the whole ſhelfe.</p>
            <p>The next day being the third of March, I commanded Lieutenant Colonell <hi>Steincallenfels</hi> to make an enterpriſe upo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Ile of <hi>Antonia Vaaz,</hi> lying right over againſt the village that ſtood upon the ſhelfe, which he did in laun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching over ſome boates: But thankes be to God, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies having already knowledge that wee were maſters of the two forts, they fled away without any making of reſiſtance. In the Cloyſter that ſtands upon that Ile hee lodged a company of his men.</p>
            <p>And thus at laſt the Towne, Caſtles and Forts (none remaining) fell under our command. I doubt not but my Lords the Adminiſtratours of this Company will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond us in this our victory, to the end they may enjoy the fruites thereof; this being indeede a place invincible, if it be well ſeconded and provided for: It is of good temperature, having freſh and good waters, and good ſtore of meate: A place I ſay of driving the greateſt trade in all Braſill; and which trade (by Gods grace) will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe mightily if it be reduced to peace; and ſuch a place as will curbe all Braſill, ſeeing there is ſuch a feare and terrour amongſt the enemies throughout the whole land already: And I hope to make ſuch a progreſſe into it, that your Lordſhips name ſhall live perpetually in it; And that by the taking of this towne, with the forts therunto belonging, all Braſill will be bridled and brought into ſubjection, and the enemies navigations along the coaſt utterly deſtroyed; which will be the way to take this trading from them, and to reduce the Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to a mutuall love, amity, and ſtrict alliance. Thus God preſerve your Lordſhips as preſervers of his people, in
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:20427:5"/>
all proſperity, to the glory of his Name, and to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of all our enemies, <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>THE armes of the King having appeaſed and ſetled the great troubles of his Kingdome, and his lillies flouriſhing with a ſweet tranquillity beyond deſire and expectation; his Majeſtie would now cauſe the enemies of his Crowne to be ſenſible of the power and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the ſame; and to that end and purpoſe condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted his forces into Italy under the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mand of my Lord the Cardinall of Richelieu: Where his Highneſſe of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy (whoſe ſpirit can never be at reſt) had for a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpace of time given threatning ſpeaches that hee would employ his forces thither for the ſervice of his Majeſty; and to this effect did offer and preſent unto the King all manner of ſubmiſſion in true and certaine fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, aſſuring my Lord the Cardinall of Richelieu (who was Commander and leader of the Kings army) of free paſſage into Italy.</p>
            <p>The Lord Cardinall, whoſe judgement and underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vertue hath adorned and endued with all manner of qualities required in a General of an army, well know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by experience that the foreſaid his Highneſſe of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy had oftentimes made the like and great proteſtations to the King, and that notwithſtanding there was never any truſt or credence to be given to his promiſes, not at this time degenerating from his excellent diſpoſition, would not accept of this his offer, unleſſe firſt of all hee would deliver into his hands divers Townes which are upon the paſſage into Italy, to the end that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine them within the limits of reaſon, if perchance hee
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:20427:7"/>
would doe that which ſhould proove contrary to the thing he had promiſed unto the King.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Savoy not knowing how he might cloſely hide, and afterwards bring to paſſe his treacherous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, well knowing that the Cardinall did uſe a great deale of prudence and policy, and that his Romiſh Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinalls hat did not any way diminiſh or hinder his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, reſolved to grant him his demaund, that thereby he might the better colour over his pernicious deſigne.</p>
            <p>But the ſaid Lord Cardinall uſing a great deale of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite providence and precaution, according to his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed manner, placed ſtrong garriſons into thoſe townes, which the Duke of Savoy had given into his poſſeſſion, and in the meane ſpace advanced his Army into Italy; ever being vigilant, and having an eſpeciall care of all the actions and paſſages of his Highneſſe of Savoy, expecting no other iſſue nor performance of his promiſe, but onely a marke and token of his infidelity.</p>
            <p>In the meane time, whileſt the Army of the King (conducted under the command of the Cardinall Riche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieu) marched and advanced into Italy, and that they muſt needs come unto hands with ſome troopes of Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh, his Highneſſe of Savoy being inſpired with an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill winde, as that is ordinary to him, betakes himſelfe to his accuſtomed inconſtancy and infidelity, truſting, that by ſuch an action he ſhould hinder and overthrow the deſigne and intention of his Majeſty: But God who commands the very ſecrets of the King, would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer his will and intention to prevaile and take effect.</p>
            <p>Whereupon having performed this ſtratagem, the Lord Cardinall poſſeſſed himſelfe of all the townes which he retained for hoſtage, and gave the towne of Rivolle to to his ſouldiers for pillage.</p>
            <p>Which being done, hee cauſed certaine Regiments co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ducted under the hand of the Lord Marſhal <hi>de Crequi,</hi> to march toward the Towne and Caſtle of Pignerolle;
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:20427:7"/>
which the ſaid Lord Marſhall inveſted with a diligence and vigilancie agreeable to ſuch a valorous courage.</p>
            <p>And at the very firſt vollie of Canon ſhot he reduced the ſame towne under the command and obedience of the King without loſſe of any of his men.</p>
            <p>The Lord Marſhall beſides this, well knowing that it was neceſſary and requiſite furiouſly to aſſault the Citta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dell or Caſtle, before the ſame could be conſtrained to yeeld, hee cauſed all his batteries to ſhoote, thereby to make tryall whether or no thoſe within the Caſtle were reſolved to keepe the ſame.</p>
            <p>Thoſe within having made certaine ſhot at the Kings forces, the Lord <hi>de Crequi</hi> cauſed a generall aſſault to be made, in which aſſault the Count <hi>de Saulx</hi> did behave himſelfe moſt valiantly, obtaining to himſelfe the Crowne of the walls, by ſcanding the firſt and chiefe Bul warke, which he gained with an invincible courage.</p>
            <p>The enemie having retired themſelves into the ſtrong hold or Fort within the Caſtle, the Lord <hi>de Crequy</hi> cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a retreate to be founded, and the next day following thoſe within the Caſtle finding themſelves ſorely preſt and hardly put to it and having alſo loſt their principall Bulwarke, ſeeing alſo that the Lord <hi>de Crequi</hi> had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered the towne, then they made ſigne for a parley.</p>
            <p>The Lord Marſhall <hi>de Crequy</hi> ſent unto them to know what they demanded; their anſwer was to yeeld, but on this condition, that faithfull promiſe might be made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, that ever after they might remaine under the government and obedience of the King, which the ſaid Lord Marſhall <hi>de Crequi</hi> aſſured them of. And the one and thirtieth day of March being Eaſterday, at ſeven a clocke in the morning, theſe Lords, the Lord Marſhall <hi>de Crequi,</hi> Count <hi>de Saulx,</hi> and <hi>de Villeroy,</hi> entred into the Caſtle with two Companies of foote.</p>
            <p>The Duke of Savoy at the preſent is much perplexed, and knowes not which way to turne himſelfe; for whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therſoever hee lookes hee ſees his owne calamity, the
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:20427:8"/>
ruine and deſtruction of his Country, having now loſt Rivolle, Pignerolle, and other places for his ſafety, and which indeede were bulwarks unto <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is all that paſſed in Piedmont at the taking of the Towne and Caſtle of Pignerolle; unto which Caſtle the Lord Marſhall <hi>de Crequy</hi> addes all neceſſaries, and carries all poſſible care for the keeping and maintaining of the ſame under the Crowne and obedience of France.</p>
            <p>O you French Nation, for this muſt you make pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſupplications unto the Almighty, that he will be pleaſed to bleſſe and preſerve his Annointed <hi>Lewis the Iuſt,</hi> beſeeching his Majeſty to afford us this grace and favour, that we may ſee this King flouriſh, and to heape upon our King bleſſings and happineſſe, giving him a ſucceſſful offſpring, to favor our Prince <hi>Dauphin,</hi> giving him victory over all his enemies. Heaven grant that our prayers may be received at his hands to whom we di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, and that his great goodneſſe be pleaſed to grant us whatſoever we demand, bleſſing our King, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting his enterpriſes, giving him the accompliſhment of all his good intentions, with the augmentation and increaſe of his Crowne and Kingdome.</p>
