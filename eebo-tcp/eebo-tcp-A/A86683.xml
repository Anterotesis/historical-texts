            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have taken upon me one of the
hardeſt Taskes this day in the
World, and who am I that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
it? but the weakeſt that ever
travelled in this high way. I find
Gyants in learning, ſtumbling, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
ſtragling, and quite tyred in
this way: many mighty men durſt never adventure
to put foot therein, and few that ever entred it can ſay
they came to their journies end; there was ſtill a
<hi>pus ultra</hi> which they all acknowledged.</p>
            <p>This only was my encouragement to enter into this
ſacred Thicket of Divine Myſteries, that that Divine
Eſſence which gave it to the world, delights to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veale
it to Babes and Sucklings in the world. I am
ſure my Lord and Maſter the King of Heaven and
Earth delights to have it ſo; The great God uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
magnifies his grace this way, by doing great things
by the weakeſt meanes, He made a poore, weake,
deſpiſed Maid, alone, to bring forth the mighty Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch
of Heaven and Earth.</p>
            <p>Indeed, in this great work I have been, (as the
bleſſed Virgin) both <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
alone. Whiles I was bigge of what I have here
brought forth in both theſe Tracts, I was inforced
<pb facs="tcp:114927:2"/>
(like <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) to hide my ſelf; for ſo grievous
were the thrumps and kicks of my friends againſt it;
whiles I went in pain of it, that I could not endure
them, and now it is born, the <hi>Herods</hi> of the times doe
ſeek its life. I muſt confeſſe it goeth adroad in a home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
dreſs, yet it is never the leſſe, nor never the worſe
truth. The Harp is <hi>Davids</hi> Harp, though the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
and the Stile (which are as the ſtrings and the
fingers) are mine; which I could heartily wiſh
were better. The rudeneſſe of them I doe acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
may give occaſion to my enemies to make me
the morrall of <hi>Lucians</hi> Fable who (deriding illiterate
ſauce-boxes) tells us of a Supercilious Aſſes whoſe
aſpiring minde (looking at leaſt five Sphere above
his reach) made his rude fingers itch to be playing
on <hi>Orpheus</hi> his Harp, snatching it therefore from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pollo</hi>
to whom 'twas dedicated, to work he went, and
made therewith ſuch an hideous noiſe, that inſtead
of making wilde Beaſts tame (as <hi>Orpheus</hi> was wont)
he made the tame Dogs of the Town madde, who
ran upon him and tore him in pieces.</p>
            <p>I doe not deſire to make the morrall of this Fable,
let if I muſt, becauſe my enemies will have it ſo, if I
make ſuch harſh muſick of that Sacred Harp the
Bible, that I inrage the Dogs of this age againſt me,
but my enemies remember that my unskilfull fingers
make harſh muſick onely in Dogs eares; and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the harp I play upon is ſtill the ſame, and none
but Dogs thereat will be inraged.</p>
            <p>I confeſſe of all Inſtruments this of <hi>Sigionoth</hi> is the
<pb facs="tcp:114927:3"/>
hardeſt, and I may truly ſay that many excellent
Muſicians (otherwayes) have made ſuch harſh mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick
on this Inſtrument, that the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Dogs have
had to Juſt a cauſe to bark at them; but as for the
<hi>Romiſh</hi> party I feare them not, becauſe I am ſure they
cannot come at me for their own Authors, they muſt
thruſt them through to touch me, and ſo muſt the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependents</hi>
likewiſe: ſo that I have the leaſt cauſe of
any man to feare either of them; and as for others,
I expect by the Law of gratitude faire dealing at their
hands: if it be asked why this Preface is made a book
diſtinct and not joyned to <hi>[Manus Teſtium]</hi> as it
ought. I anſwer, 1. 'Tis not my fault but theirs that
print it, theſe are times of ſeparation. 2. I commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
them to ſeverall hands, that if one miſcarried, the
other might poſſibly have ſafe arivall; and if either,
there might be light enough in that alone to tell the
the world who the witneſſes are, where they ſhall
be ſlain, when they ſhall be ſlain, and who ſhall ſlay
them, and when and where he ſhall be overcome
that ſlayes them; For this cauſe have I handled ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
things in this Preface which I have touched on in
the Book, and touched many things here which I
have handled in the Booke; that (in this Tract I
have handled more clearly) which <hi>I</hi> leſt obſcurely
[through over much brevity] in the Book, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
that of <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and that of the Beaſt which
ſlayes the witneſſes in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. where <hi>I</hi> have indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured

            <p>I have not ſtudied loftineſs but plainneſs of ſpeech
in theſe Tracts, I have not (as moſt Schollars doe)

            <p>THe method of Gods afflicting providence in the Church
ſince the Creation, is worthy the obſervation of all; but
more eſpecially of him who undertakes to interpret
the Holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>The method of God in his acts of providence towards his
Church are:</p>
            <p>1. To bring them exceeding low before he deliver them.</p>
            <p>2. After he hath delivered them from their great troubles, and
put them in a hopeful way of peace, for ends beſt known to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he oftentimes daſhes their hopes, and darkens the way by ſad
and heavy afflictions: As the former is undeniable, ſo the latter
is cleer in the Scriptures. See this verified in <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Father of
the twelve Patriarchs; <hi>Jacob</hi> being newly gotten from a Heard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter,
and paſſed the River with his wifes and ſubſtance, he reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to go into the <hi>Promiſed Land:</hi> when he was got ſeven dayes
journey (in all probability, out of <hi>Labans</hi> reach) on a ſudden the
ſtorm riſeth, <hi>Laban</hi> purſues him with his forces, and <hi>Eſau</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares
to ſtop him in his flight with 400 men; ſo that we may ſee
here <hi>Jacob,</hi> like Chriſt on the Croſs, a miſerable object betwixt
two Thieves. To this, <hi>Jeremiah</hi> alludes, when he propheſies of the
great troubles of the Church, immediatly before the converſion
of the twelve Tribes, He calls it the time of <hi>Iacob's</hi> trouble, none
hath bin like it. So likewiſe when the Church was delivered from
<hi>Egypt's</hi> Bondage, and all their Enemies drowned; and when they
had ſeen and taſted of the goodneſs of the Lord from Heaven, in
raining Manna, and of the ſweet and ſpiritual love-tokens of
God from Mount Sina, when God had given them Lawes and
Ordinances, and began a glorious Reformation; and when they
were going into <hi>Canaan,</hi> then riſeth <hi>Corah, Datha<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and <hi>Abiran,</hi>
againſt the Witneſſes, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> and then the people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:114927:6"/>
and that glorious Sun of a Reformation went retrogade ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
thouſand of degrees by <hi>Aſa's</hi> Diall.</p>
            <p>So likewiſe <hi>David,</hi> when he went to fetch the Ark home, he
went forth like his ſon <hi>Solomon's</hi> ſhips for gold, with great
pomp; but came home broken and tottered with loſs.</p>
            <p>He went with the Prieſts and the people to fetch the Ark to
<hi>Ieruſalem</hi> its reſting place; he made a new Cart and Wheels, and
prepared the Beaſts to draw it; he got the Ark upon the Cart, and
the Beaſts did draw it towards <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> but in the way, what
an unexpected ſtorm of croſs winds riſeth, the Beaſts ſtumbled, the
Ark tottered, Gods wrath ariſeth; and this ſtops the Ark that it
came not then to <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> To this doth <hi>Ezekiel (Chap.</hi> 1.)
allude, Where he ſeeing in a Viſion, that glorious day of the
twelve Tribes converſion to Chriſt in the laſt dayes; immediately
before that day, he ſeeth the Goſpel-Magiſtracy and Miniſtery,
drawing the Ark of a Reformation to his ſettled place: There
the Magiſtracy (as in <hi>Revel.</hi> 4.) is compared to the Beaſts which
draw the Ark, and the Miniſtery to the Wheels full of eyes, which
ſupport the Ark. Theſe <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaw carrying on a Reformation
with much boldneſs, and through many difficulties: When the
Beaſts went, the Wheels went, and they turned not: When one
was lifted, up, the other was lifted up: When the Magiſtracy went
on, the Miniſtery went on in a Reformation; but when they
ſtood, they let down their whings, there was the great ſtop: the
Magiſtracy was taken away, their whings, after the war, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.
24. were let down: and immediately follows, <hi>ver.</hi> 25. a voice from
Heaven, which is the ſame with the ſeventh Trumpet, <hi>Matth. 24.
Rev. 11. Rev.</hi> 16. 17, 18. when the great day of the Jews converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
ſhall begin, and the great obſtruction of their converſion ſhall
be removed: Likewiſe after the captivity, that joyful Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
begun and carryed on ſo ſucceſsfully, how did its even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
come upon it (as I may ſay) at noon tide? How was all
daſht, and that happy work retanded on a ſudden? And how
great a Muntain the Devils Pioneers raiſed in <hi>Zerubbabels</hi> way,
<hi>Ezra</hi> 4. Look we further, and we ſhall ſee the greateſt and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſeſt
Reformation in the world, retarded in the middle of it,
and in the height of it, even that bleſſed Reformation, which is
the ſtanding rule of Reformation to the end of the world, that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:114927:6"/>
of our Lord Jeſus in the fleſh here on Earth, when he had called
the Apoſtles, ſent out the ſeventy, two by two; and when he had
preached, healed, converted many, when his Enemies thought all
the world would follow him, when they ſang <hi>Hoſana</hi> to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,
and when his Enemies were confounded before him, being
unable to gain-ſay his truth, when all the Countries round rang
of his fame, and came to ſee him, and hear his Doctrine, and to
be healed, then on a ſudden comes <hi>Judas,</hi> and betrays him with a
kiſs: the King is taken and bound, and falſly accuſed, unjuſtly ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced
to death, ſcourged, buffited, ſpet on, mocked, carryed away
to be crucified: his Diſciples fled, he nailed to the Croſs, and a
ſpear thruſt into his heart; he taken down from the Croſs, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the grave, and there ſeated in his grave: and thus to the eye
of the world was that glorious Reformation deſtroyed, the King
being cut off, and his Officers diſſipated. This Reformation,
though to the eye of the world at that time it was quite put out,
yet it ſuddenly and unexpectedly roſe again, and broke out into
greater and more glorious flames throughout the world then
ever: For two Angels in glorious brightneſs appear at the grave
of the ſlain Jeſus, that Martyr of Martyrs, and immediatly follows
a mighty Earth-quake, whereat the ſouldiers that ſlew him trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled:
the Lord Jeſus aroſe, called together his diſperſed and
hopeleſs diſconſolate Diſciples, led them to <hi>Galilee,</hi> and there
proclaims his Imperial Power and Soveraignty, that all the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
in the world were under his power, and all the mighty Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions
in Heaven were ſubject to him: And that thoſe his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
that ſlew him, might know this, he aſcended from <hi>Mount
Olivet,</hi> which Mountain was on the Eaſt of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> exceeding
high, looking directly into <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> ſo that they that ſlew him
in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> might plainly ſee him in that glorious bright Cloud
aſcending to Heaven: and immediatly after this aſcenſion of his
to his Imperial Court in the Heaven of Heavens, where he is in
full poſſeſſion of his Royall Purchaſe, He like a Conquerour in
full poſſeſſion of his Dignity, gives to his Officers, eſpecially to
his Apoſtles, magnificent gifts, beſeeming ſo great a Prince to
give, and Officers ſo neer him to receive: theſe twelve ſpirituall
Princes, like ſo many Monarchs of Unity amongſt themſelves, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
the world amongſt them, and went forth conquering, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:114927:7"/>
to conquer, from ſea to ſea: The glorious ſpiritual Victories
that theſe Champions got, and the mighty Conqueſts over the
Devils Kingdom which they made, is not unknown to the whole
world: Their Government and Laws ſtill ſtand, and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
for ever. Apoſtacie from which hath been the miſerable
ruine of all thoſe famous Eaſtern Churches to this day. Great
hath been the apoſtacie of both Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches
from the Laws of the Apoſtles: and ſore have their ſpiritual affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
(proportionated to their ſins) been; the Eaſtern Church is
drove into the Wilderneſs by Mahumatiſme, and the Weſtern
Church by Popery: Of this grand apoſtacie, and moſt abominable
hypocriſie of the Weſtern Churches, not onely the Apoſtles, but
the Prophets in the Old Teſtament have propheſied. In the
Church-Hiſtories the diſſipation of the Jews, and the driving of
the Gentile-Church into the Wilderneſs, ſeems, to me, to begin
near about one time; and their riſing again to a flouriſhing ſtate,
ſeems to me to be both at one time, by the Propheſies of the Old
New Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Now the riſing again both of the Jews and Gentiles to a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing
ſtate under the Goſpel, is that great and laſt day (<hi>i. e.</hi>)
of Reformation, ſo much ſpoken of both by the Old Teſtament-Prophets,
by Chriſt himſelf, by the Apoſtles, and eſpecially by <hi>John</hi>
in <hi>Revelation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Of this laſt Day, there are not onely groſs miſtakes amongſt
the Ancients, but many abſur'd conjectures among the Ancients.
Many of the Ancients looking into the Propheſies, which are to
be fulfilled in the end of the Roman Monarchy; and reading
thoſe high prophetick expreſſions of that glorious Day, wherein
Chriſt promiſeth in a moſt glorious powerful manner to appear
for his Churches alvation, and his Enemies ruine; conceived that
it ſhould be by the perſonal raign of Chriſt on Earth a Thouſand
years; conceiving (rightly) that the Thouſand years binding of
Sathan, begins when Antichriſts raign is accompl<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſhed (for 'tis ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd
to think otherwiſe) but miſunderſtanding, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. as if that
Chapter were meant of the ſtate of the Church in this life, which
is againſt the clear and manifeſt light of the Holy Ghoſt in the
propheſie: This groſs miſtake (I humbly conceive) made not
onely <hi>Papias</hi> (the firſt Anthor of the abominable Opinion of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:114927:7"/>
Chriſts raign on Earth a Thouſands years) of this opinion; but
many others more moderate as <hi>Irenaeus, Turtullian, Lactantius,
Victorinus, Apolonius, Severus, Juſtinus,</hi> and ſeveral others: Theſe
did not hold as <hi>Corynthus</hi> did, that they ſhould raign with Chriſt
in corporal, but in ſpiritual delights, after 6000<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> years were
accompliſhed from the Creation, may not I ſay <hi>Auguſtine (lib.</hi>
20. <hi>de Civit. Dei, Cap.</hi> 7.) is of this opinion, and <hi>Ierome</hi> on <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.
where he ſaith, <hi>In uno Romano imperio propter Antichriſtum blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemantem,
omnia ſimul regna delenda ſunt, &amp; nequaquam terrenum
imperium erit, ſed Sanctorum converſatio;</hi> a ſaying much harped
on (though not quoted) in theſe times, to further the deſign of
ſlaying the Witneſſes. And upon the ſame miſtake (as it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived)
the Councils, though they were for the moſt part againſt
this opinion; yet they could never unanimouſly agree to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
the Opinion as heretical.</p>
            <p>Others of our recents, very learned men and pious, thinking to
confute this errour of the <hi>Chiliasts,</hi> run into more abſurdities
then the moſt of thoſe whom they endeavour to confute; for not
knowing how to remove that Mountain betwixt the <hi>Chiliasts,</hi>
and them, about the firſt Reſurrection, and the raign of the Saints,
and the 1000. years binding of Sathan: they ſay that the raign of
the Saints is pa<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t, it being before Antichriſt comes into the world:
Of this opinion is <hi>Hortulanus,</hi> and (as I am informed by Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars)
<hi>Pereus; Galianus</hi> that learned Romaniſt is of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion;
as appears by his Manuſcripts in the Vatican, by Antichriſt,
they mean that Beaſt of the Earth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 12. which ſhall ariſe,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. and ſlay the Witneſſes: few of the Romaniſts concur
with them in their opinion; but very many Proteſtants, in the
main; jump with them: but as contrary to the light of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
as darkneſs is to light.</p>
            <p>But there are other learned men of great renown, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
both theſe opinions, as <hi>Bullinger, Beucer,</hi> and <hi>Seraphin</hi>
who affirm that the great and magnificent promiſes made to the
Church in the old Teſtament and in the new, are not yet fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,
but are to be fulfilled after the downfall of Antichriſt, after
which (ſay they, and others with them) the Devills kingdom of
darkneſſe, hereſie and blaſphemie ſhall be ruined, and the Church
ſhall no more be afflicted with hereſie, but the heavenly form of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:114927:8"/>
government ſhall be ſet up in the Church, which ſhall ſuppreſſe
all its enemies: with theſe learned men, ſo far as I have quoted
them, I ſhall concur.</p>
            <p>For, this I do affirm (yet not I, but the Scriptures) that there
is another great day of reformation to be in the world before
the day of judgment, beſides that great day of reformation al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
paſt, which Chriſt when he was on earth began: this ſhall be
a more glorious day then any that ever yet was on earth: I do not
ſay that Chriſt ſhall reign on earth perſonally, I abhor that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
with that learned Father B. <hi>Hall,</hi> in his tract called the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations
unrevealed:</hi> but I (or rather the Prophets) do affirm,
that in this great day of reformation to come, after the down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall
of Antichriſt, the twelve Tribes ſhall be converted to the
Goſpel. Here therefore I muſt with my reverend fathers good
leave be his diſſenting ſon, notwithſtanding all he hath ſaid to
the contrary: For firſt, whereas he ſaith, the promiſes in the
Prophets are ſpiritually to be taken, and not literally, concerning
the twelve Tribes; but concerning the Goſpel-Church, I briefly
reply, this argument is invalid, becauſe he neither backs it with
reaſon nor Scripture: with reaſon he cannot, for it is a <hi>non ſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi>
to ſay, becauſe the Prophets ſomtimes are to be underſtood,
therefore alwayes; I am ſure this is neither true in Logick nor
Divinity.</p>
            <p>2. There is no probability in his aſſertion: for though indeed
Jeruſalem be ſomtimes in the Prophets put for the Goſpel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Church,
yet where the Prophets ſpeak of the houſe of <hi>Iudah,</hi> and
the houſe of <hi>Ioſeph,</hi> there I believe 'twill be hard for the Doctor
to prove that they are ſpiritually to be underſtood of the Goſpel
Church, as <hi>Zach.</hi> 10. 6, 7, 8. ſo in ſeverall other places: had the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop
inſtanced in any place of the Prophets, we ſhould have
grapled then for probability. But I paſſe on.</p>
            <p>3. If theſe Prophecies do nothing concern the reſtauration of
the Jewes in theſe latter dayes, then to what purpoſe did God
ſend his Prophets to ſing ſongs in their ears, if it nothing
concerned them? Certainly theſe Prophecies were propheſied a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
them to no purpoſe; if all thoſe Prophecies belonged
to the Gentiles, then certainly God would have ſent his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
amongſt them, but they principally concerned the Jewes,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:114927:8"/>
and therefore they were propheſied amongſt them, and to them,
to whom they belonged; for God never ſends his Prophets
out of order, all Gods Prophets propheſied to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
to whom they were ſent, but the Prophets of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
were appointed Prophets for the twelve Tribes (except
thoſe that had ſpeciall Commiſſion, as <hi>Ionas,</hi> to go to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles)
and therefore to them principally theſe Propheſies belong,
and therefore that hard queſtion is thus reſolved, ſince in <hi>Luke 21.
Ieruſalem ſhall be trodden underfoot untill the time of the Gentiles
be fulfilled;</hi> and the time of the Gentiles reigne continues (<hi>Rev.</hi>
11. 2.) 1260. years, how coms it to paſſe in <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. that the time
of the Church's diſſipation ſhall be 1290. dayes? To that 'tis thus
anſwered; <hi>Daniel</hi> was a Prophet principally deſigned for the
Jewes, and therefore God declares to him how long the diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Jewes ſhall be, which (as M. <hi>Brightman</hi> and other
learned men ſay on <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 11.) began <hi>Anno</hi> 360. therefore their
time is up about this yeare 1650. their time of diſſipation being
to continue 1290. years: but now our Saviour in <hi>Luke</hi> 21. 24. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
the Goſpel Gentile Church, as well as the Jewes, which
ſhall be (as <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 1.) drove into a ſack cloth condition untill
the time of 1260. years be accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>Now many learned men count, that the time of Antichriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing
to be formally Antichriſt, and the time of the Witneſſes
going into the Wilderneſs, and putting on ſackcloth, was in, or
neer about the year 390. So that Antichriſts raign, and the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
ſackcloth condition, is expired in <hi>Anno,</hi> 1650. Now if <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
in his Propheſie, ſhould onely reſpect the Gentile Church,
how could <hi>Iohn, Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Daniel,</hi> be reconciled in their prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies?
To return therefore to the thing in hand, we affirm, that
the Prophets in the Old Teſtament, propheſied of the future<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
ſtate of their own Kindred and Nation, and not of the
Gentile Church; but accidentally and occaſionally for the moſt
part; as ſhewing what ſhall come to paſs in the Gentile-Church,
immediatly before the great Day of the Jews converſion, which
is the ſign that the Jews ſhall have of their approaching glorious
Day: And therefore the Old Teſtament propheſies of the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niting
of the houſe of <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and <hi>Iudah</hi> together under one
King, and bringing them back again to their own Land, can be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:114927:9"/>
meant of nothing, but of the reſtoring of the Twelve Tribes to
their own Land, under their ancient government, as in <hi>Davids</hi>
time.</p>
            <p>As for his alleaging a ſeeming inpoſſibility, that they that have
been out-caſts ſo long from the Covenant of Grace, ſhould now
be called home to the Goſpel (which is it ſeems beyond the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
faith) to that we anſwer, and he acknowledgeth. 1. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is impoſſible with God. 2. God hath promiſed to call
the diſperſed out-caſts of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> from the four corners of the
Earth, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 11. 12. and they ſhall be ſo hopeleſs in the eye of the
world, that before their converſion they ſhall be as dry bones in
<hi>Golgotha, Ezek.</hi> 37. 1, 2. Yet God will call theſe dry bones toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
Therefore their converſion is alſo expreſſed, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 11,
12. under the notion of raiſing dead men out of their graves God
will firſt open their graves, and then lead them out of their
graves: ſo that to the world they ſhall ſeem dead and buried,
when God intends to convert them: ſo that that which upon a
bare principle of reaſon the Biſhop makes his argument againſt
the Truth, I upon a principle of faith, built upon Gods promiſes,
make the argument to confirm this Truth; and who ſtands on the
Beaſts bottom (whether he on bare Reaſon, or I on a divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe)
I'le leave Chriſtians to judge: But that which the Biſhop
moſt derides, is the opinion of thoſe, who ſay this year, 1650. the
Jews ſhall be converted; he bids us ſhew him a thrave of Jewes
as yet converted, which are now to gather, profeſſing the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell.</p>
            <p>To this 'tis anſwered: 1 We can ſhew in this year, 1650.
more probability for the converſion not onely of a few, but thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
of the Hebrews to the faith of Chriſt, then the Biſhop can
againſt it: In the year, 1650. there is a book that makes mention of
5900. Eaſt-Indians converted to Jeſus Chriſt, by Mr. <hi>Robert
Iunius.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now there are more arguments to prove theſe of the Seed of
<hi>Iacob,</hi> then the Biſhop can bring to prove the contrary. Again,
look into the Weſt-Indies, and this year 1650. tells us of a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Harveſt begun, in the converſion of thoſe Natives there; and
there is more probability that they are of the ſtock of <hi>Iacob,</hi> then
the contrary. For there have been Jews that travelled thoſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:114927:9"/>
ways, who have found ſome of the Ten Tribes in <hi>America:</hi>
ſome learned Travellers have rationally conjectured, that thoſe
Natives in <hi>New-England</hi> are ſome of the Ten Tribes: For upon
diligent obſervation of the people, their Cuſtomes, Language, and
Ceremonies, have brought theſe arguments, to prove them He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews;
for (ſay they) 1. They have a traditionall knowledge of
God, which they ſay their fore-fathers which were wiſe, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
with knowledge, taught them: they ſay that God made the
world, and this God is but one God.</p>
            <p>2. They ſay this God is the Author of all the good that is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed
in the world, and the author of all the evill that is inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in the world.</p>
            <p>And hence is that cuſtom amongſt them to this day, When any
evill is inflicted on them, either by immoderate weather, whereby
their corn is ſpoiled, or by any other judgment, they ſolemnly
meet together under a green tree, and weep before him who
hath inflicted all that evill upon them, whom they acknowledg to
be the Maker of the World.</p>
            <p>3. They preſerve their pedigree, with all the care they can, as
far as their memories will go, and are carefull to promote their
kindred after the manner of the <hi>Hebrews.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>4. The chief of them are exceeding reſerved, and keep them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from ſtrangers, ſo that the wiſeſt of them are hard to be
met withall, whereby further diſcovery might be made of their
Original; but much of the golden oar, of the Hebrew Language,
is found among the droſſie Language of the vulgar Natives.</p>
            <p>5. 'Tis ſaid that they are excellent in expreſſing themſelves
parabolically, after the manner of the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> By all which
there is probability, that they are of the diſperſed of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> whom
God is now calling home to the knowledge of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Menaſſeh Ben-Iſrael</hi> ſaith, and alſo <hi>Montezinus,</hi> (both Jews,
and learned men) that the firſt Inhabitants of <hi>America</hi> were the
Ten Tribes: if ſo, I think I have the greateſt probability on my
ſide, that theſe many Thouſands that we have heard of already
converted, and the many more Thouſands which we expect and
pray for, are <hi>Hebrews</hi> of the ſons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> to be converted to
<hi>Christ</hi> in this age of the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:114927:10"/>
But ſuppoſe there were never a Jew converted, muſt this
make the purpoſe of God of none effect? God forbid, it is true
that from <hi>poſſe</hi> to <hi>eſſe</hi> there can be no certain conſequence; but
from Gods promiſe to his purpoſe, we may conclude affirmative<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>If God have promiſed to convert the Jews, 'tis his purpoſe to
call them: all his promiſes are <hi>yea,</hi> and <hi>amen:</hi> if God promiſe that
<hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall be no longer then 40. years in <hi>Egypt,</hi> they ſhall be
there not a day longer, though nothing more unlikely in the
world then their deliverance: ſo ſhall it be in their converſion in
theſe latter dayes, though there be nothing more unlikely, yet
there ſhall be nothing more certain; for God hath promiſed it,
<hi>Rom. 11. 25, 26. All Iſrael ſhall be ſaved i. e.</hi>) all the Tribes ſhall
be converted: the precedent verſe tells us the time when (<hi>viz.)
When the fulneſſe of the Gentiles is come in,</hi> that is, (as in <hi>Luke</hi> 21.
24.) when the time of the Gentiles is fulfilled, which <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.
2.) is 42. moteths, <hi>i. e.</hi> 1260. dayes, <hi>i. e.</hi> years.</p>
            <p>Obſerve, <hi>Paul</hi> writes to the Church of Rome, forbidding them
to boaſt of their Goſpel-priviledges, in a proud inſulting way
over the rejected Jews.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Paul</hi> foreſaw to what impudent inſulting pride the Church of
Rome would riſe; therefore he bids the Church not to be
high-minded, but fear; for if God ſpared not the Jews, the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
branches, much leſs would he ſpare the Gentile-church of
Rome: for this end <hi>Paul</hi> would not have the Gentile-church ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
of this myſtery, which myſtery of God (<hi>Rev.</hi> 10. 7.) ſhall be
finiſhed at the ſeventh Trumpet, and that is when Antichriſt that
ſits in Rome, when the fulneſs of his time ſhall come in, then
ſhall <hi>Iſrael</hi> be converted: Here <hi>Iſrael</hi> is put in oppoſition to the
Gentile-church. Now this <hi>Paul</hi> acquaints the Roman church
with, leſt they ſhould be wiſe in their own conceit, or over-much
puffed up with pride: ſo that from theſe texts it ſeems cleer to
me, That the Jews converſion ſhall be at that time when the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Pontifick ſtate ſhall go to ruine; and if in this ſenſe we may
underſtand <hi>Romanum imperium,</hi> the Biſhop knows better then
my ſelf. I have many thraves of ancient and latter Writers to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
me againſt him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:114927:10"/>
Laſtly, I anſwer, That the converſion of the Jews ſhall come in
on the ſudden: they ſhall come like the Doves to the windows,
that is, ſwiftly and in great numbers; and this ſhall be (<hi>Ezek.</hi> 37.
11.) when <hi>Iſrael</hi> gave themſelves for loſt, and their hopes were
cut off, then the whole houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> like bones exceeding dry,
came together, and they that were in the Valley of dry bones (<hi>v.</hi>
1.) became an exceeding great Army, <hi>ver.</hi> 10. How cleer there
doth the Holy Ghoſt propheſie of the converſion of the whole
houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that is, the twelve Tribes.</p>
            <p>Now if it ſhould be objected, 'twas propheſied of their reſtau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
under the ſecond Temple, to that I anſwer, it cannot be,
becauſe onely the two Tribes returned, and not the ten Tribes, to
the ſecond Temple, as <hi>Manaſs-Ben-Iſrael</hi> affirms; and generally
all Hiſtorians hold, that very few of the ten Tribes returned with
the two.</p>
            <p>But now this Propheſie extends to the whole houſe of Iſrael,
<hi>ver. 11. (i e.</hi>) the twelve Tribes: So that from the time of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie,
untill this day, it hath not as yet been fulfilled, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
'tis to be fulfilled; and when 'tis fulfilled, it will be ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
as Romes ruine will be ſudden, ſo the Jews converſion will
be ſudden, and therefore our Lord Jeſus, and their true Meſſia's
prophecying of their converſion, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24. in <hi>ver.</hi> 24, 25, 26. he
tells them Antichriſt ſhall be buſie with his falſe Prophets imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
before the day of Chriſts coming to deſtroy Antichriſt, and
to convert the Jewes; and then ſhall he come, as the lightning
which comes from the Eaſt, and is quickly in the Weſt, ſo ſhall
the coming of Chriſt be.</p>
            <p>This coming of Chriſt cannot be meant of his coming to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but of his coming to call the Jews to repentance, and to
deſtroy the Roman Monarchy, or the Roman Antichriſtian Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifick
ſtate in ver. 29. the deſtruction of Rome is propheſied, and
<hi>ver.</hi> 30. propheſies of the repentance of the twelve Tribes in the
day of his ſpiritual appearance to them in the Goſpel, <hi>ver.</hi> 31.
propheſies of the time when this ſhall be; it ſhall be at the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the great voyce, and the Trumpet, that is, at the ſounding
of the ſeventh Trumpet, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 16. when the Witneſſes ſhall riſe,
Antichriſt ſhall fall, and <hi>Euphrates</hi> ſhall be dryed up, <hi>ver.</hi> 32, 33.
tells us, that the Tribulation of the Goſpel-church under the rage
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:114927:11"/>
of Hereticks, as Separatiſts, Blaſphemers, Seducers, Antichriſts, and
falſe Prophets, is as ſure a ſign of the downfall of Rome, and the
converſion of the Jews, as the budding and ſprouting of the trees
are of the approaching of the ſummer.</p>
            <p>Now theſe Hereſies, and theſe falſe Prophets ſhall be eminent in
the Goſpel-Gentile Church, which ſhall be the true ſign of the
Jews converſion, <hi>ver.</hi> 34. plainly tells us, this cannot be meant of
the day of Judgement; for this generation (ſaith Chriſt) ſhall not
paſſe, that is, the ſtock of Iſrael ſhall not be extirpate, untill they
have ſeen all theſe things fulfilled; this day is called <hi>Luke</hi> 21. the
day of the redemption of the twelve Tribes: Now if this day
(as ſome would have it) be the day of Judgement, this day
would be the damnation of the Tribes, if they muſt be in the
world untill this day, and unconverted; therefore this day is the
day of the Jews converſion, not the day of Judgement. <hi>ver.</hi> 25.
The next verſe is to confirm the certainty of the Prophecy, <hi>For
heaven and earth ſhall paſſe away, but not one title of the Word ſhall
paſſe away. ver. 36. But of that day, and of that hour (i. e.</hi>) (of the
heavens and earth paſſing away) <hi>knoweth no man:</hi> by this 'tis
manifeſt, that Chriſt in the whole Chapter ſpeaks not one word
of the day of Judgement, untill <hi>ver.</hi> 35. which he forbids any to
pry into; for God only knew that; but of the day of his coming
to ruine Rome, and convert the Jews; he bids us by the foregoing
ſignes know for certain that it was near, even at the doors. <hi>ver.</hi>
33. Now this glorious coming of Chriſt in his ſpirituall and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall
puniſhments on his enemies; and his ſpirituall and corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
favors to the Jews, ſhall be as the lightning which is ſwift in
it's motion, it gives light from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>Weſt</hi> preſently, ſo ſhall all
the Kingdomes in this world become the Lords, and his Chriſts
on a ſuddain: Therefore far be it from any Proteſtant to have
ſuch a malignant thought, as that God hath forgot to be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
or that his hand is ſhortned that he cannot help the poor
Jews, which are this day, many of them, looking, liſtening, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring
at us in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> whoſe eyes, I truſt, ſhall
ſee ſome glorious ſign of good to them ere long.</p>
            <p>Forty times more may be ſaid in vindication of this manifeſt
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:114927:11"/>
truth, concerning the twelve Tribes converſion; but conſidering
how little is ſaid againſt it, I ſhall ſay no more, but proceed.</p>
            <p>The ſubject of my enſuing Diſcourſe in this, and <hi>Manus Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi>
which ſhould be joyned with this is, concerning this great day.</p>
            <p>My opinion is, that the three grand Enemies of the Church
ſhall neer about the end, or within a year of 1650. begin to riſe,
and never fall more: at this time alſo the morning of the Jews
converſion ſhall begin, and ſhall ſhine more and more untill it
come to a perfect day.</p>
            <p>Theſe Opinions the Reader ſhall find bottomed on Scripture,
which Scriptures are not of any private interpretation, but ſuch
as are matched with Scripture, which illuſtrate the things proved
by them, and alſo have ſeveral learned Authors concurring, in the
confirmation of the ſame thing; ſo that if I am laughed at for my
opinion, I doubt not but in that particular (what ever it be of
moment) I ſhall make the Remonſtrant confeſs, he ſcoffs not
onely at me, but at his betters.</p>
            <p>I write not this to deter any from endeavouring to confute
this enſuing Tract: for one end of my writing ſo briefly on ſo
large a ſubject, is, that I may have a ſpeedy anſwer, and a ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
confutation; which if it be cleer from Scripture-grounds, I
ſhall readily and willingly ſubmit, and return a thankfull Reply
to my Corrector, and promiſe him to retract my Errours.</p>
            <p>As for the time of Antichriſts fall, which I conceive to begin
preſently after 1650. it is well known that 'tis no new opinion; for
<hi>Brightman,</hi> and ſeveral other learned men have ſo conjectured,
upon this ground, which is humane, becauſe 'tis drawn from hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ſtory: for he begins the Jews great afflictions in <hi>An.</hi> 360.
ſo that their 1290. years afflictions muſt neceſſarily be expired in
this year, 1650. and Dr. <hi>Homes,</hi> and ſeveral others well-verſed in
the ſtudy of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> and of Hiſtory, do gather, that Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
appeared viſibly in the Church in <hi>Anno</hi> 390. ſo that the
Gentile and Jewiſh church afflictions ſeem both to expire at one
time; for Antichriſt is to rage over the Gentile church but 1260.
years, which by the compute is accompliſhed <hi>Anno</hi> 1650. Now (as
Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> ſaith very well) in ſo many years, poſſibly, there may
be loſt-time in the account; ſo that he takes a grain of allowance
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:114927:12"/>
(that is) a year over to his 1260. years: Upon the ſame ground,
in this thing, I ſhall follow him, and comply with him, though
there is no neceſſity for it.</p>
            <p>Others (as <hi>Clavis Apocalyptica,</hi> written by a German) draw
water from the ſame Springs, quote the ſame texts, as <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. and
<hi>Rev.</hi> 11. and looking into Hiſtory, ſay, that theſe texts of 1290.
days, and 1260. days, are not fulfilled until 1655. ſo that theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
with the former in explication of the texts, but not in appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of the Hiſtories to the text: in which difference, he that
hath the cleareſt Hiſtories to ſhew the time of Antichriſts riſing,
and the time of the Witneſſes going into ſackcloth, as relating to
the Gentile Church; and likewiſe he that interprets that text
(<hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 11.) moſt clearly, and by hiſtory can clear it exactly, and
tell when the daily ſacrifice was taken away, and the abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of deſolation ſet up be doubtleſs, will gaine the greateſt
credit from the judicious Reader.</p>
            <p>In my jndgment learned <hi>Brightman</hi> on <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 11. is moſt
clear and rational, and none do, I find, gueſs nearer the time (in
print) of Antichriſts viſible appearance in the Church, then Dr.
<hi>Homes,</hi> let me give the Devil his due. But of the main point,
which is concerning the ſlaying the Witneſſes at, or neer the end,
(or whether at or neer the end) of Antichriſts 1260. years Raign,
he ſpeaks not a word, which makes me think, that his Sermon,
<hi>Octob.</hi> 8. 1650. was preached againſt the light of his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;
For in the <hi>Revelations</hi> the Holy Ghoſt hath ſo linked
Antichriſts raign, and the Witneſſes ſlaying in the end of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſts
raign, that he that ſtudies the one, muſt neceſſarily take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of the other; and indeed he that can ſhew us the Witneſſes
ſlain, may eaſily point at the end both of the Goſpel-church affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
and the Jewiſh States diſſipation: but here is the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and here are the groſs miſtakes of men, who ſtudying applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of hiſtory to the text, more then the explication of the text
it ſelf, have given moſt ridiculous gheſſes, to the great ſcandall of
the Proteſtant.</p>
            <p>My Antagoniſt ſpeaks not one word to this text; but the
German Divine in his <hi>Clavis Apocaliptica, p.</hi> 87. tells us, that three
years and a half before Antichriſts raign is out the Witneſſes ſhall
be ſlain; for (ſaith he) they both expire together, both Antichriſts
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:114927:12"/>
raign, and the Witneſſes ſlaying: and therefore he renders, <hi>Rev.</hi>
11. 7. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>in futuro ſimplici,</hi> when they are about to finiſh: ſo
<hi>Cloverius</hi> and <hi>Mead</hi> reads the text: In this I ſhall not much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
from them; yet I think they render it beſt, who read it from
the words, as it moſt naturally drops into Engliſh, and that is
when they ſhall have finiſhed their teſtimony: for it will nothing
at all claſh with <hi>ver.</hi> 2. where they propheſie 1260. days in ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth:
for the finiſhing of their teſtimony doth not cauſe their
prophecying to ceaſe: their ſuffering, and their ſlaying is the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſeſt
part of their ſackcloth propheſie; for then ſaith the Holy
Ghoſt, <hi>Here is their faith, and here is their patience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The finiſhing of their teſtimony is the joynt concurrence of
the two Witneſſes (<hi>viz.</hi> the Magiſtracy and the Miniſtery) in eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing
the Doctrine and the Diſcipline of the Church of Chriſt
againſt Antichriſt the Beaſt of the Sea (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the Pope that keeps
the Witneſſes in ſackcloth on the one hand, and againſt the Beaſt
of the Earth that ſlayes the Witneſſes on the other hand; now
when was this teſtimony finiſhed? the ſum of this teſtimony you
ſhall find in the Covenant; but when they finiſhed this teſtimony
I leave Chriſtians to judge, Whether when the Aſſembly of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines
had finiſhed their work, that of the Doctrine, and Diſcipline
of the Church, and when the Parliament ratified their work, reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to disband their Armies, and bring home the King on honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
covenant-tearms; and then the Beaſt of the Earth aroſe,
made war againſt them, and drove them out of the houſe: ſince
which that Reformation hath lain dead. Or whether it began
then when the Magiſtracy were fully agreed to eſtabliſh the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
and the Diſcipline of the Church againſt Popery, on one
hand, and Hereſie on the other, when the King gave his royal aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
and the Parliament voted the Kings conceſſions to be a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
ground for the eſtabliſhing the peace of the Church and

them, and kills them: how kills them? <hi>Rev.</hi> 20. 5. makes
anſwer, beheads them, (ſaith <hi>Beza</hi>) cuts them off with the
Axe.</p>
            <p>Now which of theſe times 'tis, is no eaſie thing to determin; but
the former act ſeems, to me, to be the time when they finiſhed their
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:114927:13"/>
teſtimony: For then the Beaſt ſet up his Sword-power, and then
the Magiſtracy and Miniſtery finiſhed their Church-work: and
immediatly after they had finiſhed it, this Beaſt of the bottomleſs
put threw it down, and then followed that abominable Vote of
<hi>non-addreſſes to the King.</hi>

               <hi>December,</hi> 1648. when the King
was ſlain, and the Offices of the Two Houſes ſlain, and the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
ſcatterd, for not ſubſcribing to the Beaſts mark, then the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
will not riſe untill <hi>June,</hi> 1652.</p>
            <p>Now that theſe Witneſſes are the Magiſtracy and the Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
there is nothing ſo cleer as learned <hi>Woodcock</hi> on <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. makes
it appear, and ſeveral others; beſides the ferenity of the holy texts
themſelves, which makes it moſt cleer: This is moſt certain, that
the two Witneſſes are two lawful Offices (<hi>i. e.</hi>) a lawful Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy,
and a lawful Miniſtery.</p>
            <p>Now their Oppoſites who ſlay them, are Uſurpers in the
State, and Uſurpers in the Church (that is the Beaſt of the Earth
and the Beaſt of the Sea, with their followers) now the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
riſing ſhall be theſe Uſurpers confuſion (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the ruine
of the Pope, and the Beaſt of the Earth, with their ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
men of name: ſo that the Battel ſhall be fought betwixt
lawful Magiſtracy, and lawful Miniſtery, againſt Uſurping Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy
and Miniſtery; but more of this in its place. The greateſt
difference (betwixt thoſe that come near the time of their ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is concerning the place where they muſt be ſlain: Now there
are many groundleſs conceits that we find in print, about this
place, where they ſhall be ſlain, I ſhall not repeat what others
have ſaid, but indeavour to prove that the Witneſſes muſt be ſlain
in theſe three Iſlands of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This I ſhall prove: 1. From the Offices that are ſlain. 2. From
the perſon that ſlays them.</p>
            <p>The Offices that are ſlain are Two; a lawful Magiſtracy, and a
lawful Miniſtery. The lawful Magiſtracy is that which hath the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:114927:13"/>
Chriſt and his Apoſtles ordained in the Church, and eſtabliſhed,
untill his ſecond coming for to teach, inſtruct, rebuke and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
the Church.</p>
            <p>Now theſe two muſt be ſlain in that place where they have all
their time been in ſackcloth; but a lawfull viſible Magiſtracy,
and a lawfull viſible Miniſtery have ſince 390. been viſible in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
though in ſackcloth under the Popes tyranny, treachery,
and oppreſſion: Now let theſe Countreys that brag of the
ſlaying of the Witneſſes, amongſt them firſt ſhew me for
theſe thouſand two hundred and ſixty years.</p>
            <p>A lawfull Magiſtracy and Miniſtery, and then thoſe ſo long in
ſackcloth if they ſhew me not this, I'le not believe the Witneſſes
ſhalbe ſlain where they are not; but confident I am, England can
only ſhew theſe Witneſſes, &amp; no Nation els, ſo long together in
the world; as God continued Monarchy in the Church from the
Creation, untill the mighty Monarch of the world came: So that
mighty Monarch the Lord Jeſus after his Aſcention, choſe him his
firſt Vice-Gerent here in England: <hi>Lucius</hi> hy name, who ſwaid
the Scepter for Chriſt; from that Chriſtian Race the Romans re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
their Chriſtian Magiſtracy (as <hi>Constantine</hi>) and Chriſtian
Monarchy (except in a National diſcertion) hath continued viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
in this Kingdome of England, well nigh 1500 years; ſo that
England above and before all other Nations ſince the profeſſion
of the Goſpell hath retained Gods Witneſſes, a lawfull
Miniſtery being eſtabliſhed by that good King <hi>Lucius,</hi> that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Monarch; let us then look for the Witneſſes where God
hath placed them, and never till this day totally plucked them
up: I ſay, I here challenge all the Hiſtorians and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaries
in the world, to ſhew me where, or when ſince theſe
fourteen hundred years paſt; that the two great Offices in the
Church and State (the lawfull Magiſtracy, and the lawfull Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery)
were in ſo ſad a ſlain abject condition, as at this day in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
let Hiſtorians bring me the blackeſt night that ever came
upon theſe two Offices, and I dare undertake to make it appear,
that this day is ſeven times blacker and ſadder to theſe great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,
then any heretofore; may I not add one thing more, to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:114927:14"/>
prove that the Witneſſes have onely been in this Kingdome viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
in ſackcloth, before <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conquerors</hi> time, our Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles

Church of Chriſt, <hi>ad nos ſpectat,</hi> it belongeth to the King, not to
the Pope; and this he did (ſaith <hi>Hoveden</hi>) by the advice and
means of <hi>Ethelwood,</hi> Biſhop of Winton, and <hi>Oſwald</hi> Biſhop of

and Miniſters, againſt the Popes ſupremacy, and before that
as is evident in <hi>Malmſbury de Geſt. Reg. lib. 2. P.</hi> 57. afatrwards,
from <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Conqueror</hi> to the laſt King of England, we
have it clear, they have teſtified againſt the Popes uſurpation,
and have in every Age ſuffered much, and been put into ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth,
by the prevailing treacherous, rebellious factions of the
Popes raiſing againſt the Kings of England, no Kingdome
in Europe can ſay the like, and which is one of the remarkableſt
paſſages in the world; the King that waſt cut off when he had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
his teſtimony, was the only Proteſtant King in the world;
therefore the only Witneſſe (ſay I) yea he was, as learned Sir
<hi>Robert Naunton</hi> proves in his <hi>fragmenta regalia, cap. 1. p.</hi> 2. the
lawfull Succeſſor by lineall diſſent of the ancient Britiſh Kings,
ſo that if any Magiſtracy in the world be the ſlain Witneſſe, 'tis
that of England, which is lawfull in it's ſelf, hath been viſible for
Chriſt before Antichriſt, in ſackcloth viſible under Antichriſt, and
in the ſight and hearing of all the world cut off with the Axe, for
finiſhing the teſtimony againſt Antichriſt. Now as for the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery
of England, the other Witneſſe of Chriſts againſt Antichriſt,
that it hath been as ancient as the Chriſtian Magiſtracy, and as vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
ſuffered under Antichriſt, and now lieth under the greateſt
reproach ignominy, and ſlain condition, is as clear as the former.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſay nothing to this Office, that Office will ſpeak for it
ſelf, I am ſure 'tis of age and ability enough to gainſay all his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers,
you ſee how much probability we have from the perſons
that are ſlain, that the Engliſh Magiſtracy and Miniſtery are the
Witneſſes.</p>
            <p>Now we proceed to ſhew what probability, there is, that
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:114927:14"/>
theſe Witneſſes are to be ſlain in theſe Northern Iſlands, I will ſay
the leſſe of the Beaſt that ſlaies them, becauſe I portrayed him in
the enſuing tract, I ſhal only diſcover him where he is to be found
in Scripture Prophecies, and then what thoſe Scripture Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
ſay of his downfal in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. he is called the Beaſt that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendeth
out or the bottomleſſe pit after the Witneſſes have fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
their teſtimony, where note that this Beaſt that ſlaies the
Witneſſes, is not the Pope, but one that riſeth when the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
have finiſhed their teſtimony, and his raign is but three years
and an half, and this all the Greek and Latin Fathers aſſent unto,
and 'tis as clear as the Sun from this text.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 11. he is called the Beaſt of the Earth, to have us to
obſerve, that he is one diſtinct from the Sea, <hi>ver.</hi> 5. 'tis wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full
to behold how many learned Proteſtants joyn theſe toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in one, when God by his Word hath ſevered; they are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
by their originall; the one ariſeth out of the earth, and
the other out of the Sea.</p>
            <p>The Holy Ghoſt calls the Beaſt of the Earth another, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Proteſtants (though not all of them, for Biſhop <hi>Cooper</hi> ſaith,
'tis one diſtinct from the Beaſt of the Sea) make them notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the ſame, the Beaſt of the Earth hath but two horns, and
and the Beaſt of the ſea ten: more arguments may be picked out
of the texts to prove the Beaſt of the Earth which ſlays the
Witneſſes ſhall riſe and raigne but three years and an half during
the time the Witneſſes ſhall lie ſlain, as 'tis clear, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. 12. this
Beaſts riſing is the Witneſſes falling, and the Witneſſes riſing in
this Beaſts ruine, That the Beaſt of the Earth, and the Beaſt of the
bottomleſſe pit are one, and the ſame is clear, for <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 10. 11.
he riſeth then, when the faith and patience of the Witneſſes
are exerciſed, here is the faith and patience of the Saints, their
ſuffering graces, when the Beaſt of the Earth ariſeth, are exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
and the Beaſt of the bottomleſſe pit, is he that exerciſeth
their defenſive graces, ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. he makes war with them
and overcomes and kills them.</p>
            <p>This Beaſt of the Earth, or bottomleſſe pit Beaſt, is called in
<hi>Rev.</hi> 17. the Beaſt bearing up Babilon with all her blaſphemies
murthers. In this ſevententh Chapter the Holy Ghoſt gives us a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:114927:15"/>
view of the laſt Scene of the laſt Act of the Romiſh Antichriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Factors: I'le beg the ſober Chriſtians earneſt attention here,
for it is the hardeſt Chapter in the whole <hi>Revelation,</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 1.
the Angell tells you what time o'th' day 'tis with Rome, 'tis neer
her judgment day at this time: <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaw a woman ſitting on a
ſcarlet beaſt: Here are three diſtinct names mentioned in the
Chapter, the Woman, the Beaſt, and the great Whore: Now the
great Whore ſitting on many waters, <hi>v.</hi> 1. is expounded <hi>v.</hi> 15. to
be that ſpirituall Whore that hath inticed the kings of the earth
to commit idolatry (which is ſpirituall fornication) with her:
this Whore is the Pope of Rome which inhabits the City with
ſeven hills, which is Rome. The woman mentioned <hi>v.</hi> 3. is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
<hi>v.</hi> 9. and <hi>v.</hi> 18. 'tis the city ſtanding on ſeven hills as
Rome doth, <hi>v.</hi> 18. 'tis the Metropolitan city as Rome is. But
now the ſcarlet-coloured beaſt, <hi>v.</hi> 3. which beares up the city
Rome, is not ſo plainly to the eye of the Reader unfolded,
though there be moſt ſpoken in this Chapter of this Beaſt and
his party, this Beaſt is one part of the myſtery which <hi>Iohn</hi> won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
at. Obſerve therefore in <hi>v.</hi> 3. this Beaſt is called a ſcarlet
coloured Beaſt, becauſe of his bloudineſſe: This Beaſt cannot be
the Pope, for the Pope is the great Whore that ſits upon many
waters, and is born up by this Beaſt, 2. It cannot be the Pope,
for the Pope came not out of the bottomleſſe pit, but fell from
heaven, and got the key of Independency into his own hands,
which is the bottomleſſe pit there ſpoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. 1. But now
this Beaſt coms out of the bottomleſſe pit, to ſhew that this
Beaſt is the ſelfeſame that ſlayes the Witneſſes, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7. who
alſo coms out of the bottomleſſe pit. 3. This Beaſt cannot be
the Pope upon any rationall account from any Expoſitor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
this Beaſt is the eighth, and is of the ſeven: Now the Pope
by every Proteſtant account makes the ſeventh diſtinct head of
government in Rome, but this Beaſt is of the eighth: now leſt he
ſhould be taken for the eighth head of Rome, the Holy Ghoſt
(as it were with a <hi>Prolepſin, v.</hi> 11.) tells us he is of the ſeven, and
how he is of the ſeven; it may be becauſe he beares up the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
with ſeven heads, and ten horns: he is none of the ten ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
to Rome, neither is he one of the ſeven heads of Rome,
but he is the eighthdiſtinct from the ſeven of Rome, and of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:114927:15"/>
ten hornes ſubject to Rome, and yet he is of the ſeven, that is, he
hath ſomthing of all their wicked craft and ſubtilty, he is of the
ſeven (ſaith <hi>Haymo</hi>) becauſe this Beaſt ſhall ſeven times more
perſecute the Church of Chriſt then the other ſeven: this holds
good; for to prove him to be the Beaſt that ſlayes the Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.
Saith another of this text, he is the eighth, becauſe <hi>regnum
ejus diſtinctum à ſingulis,</hi> and he is of the ſeven, <hi>Quia in omnibus
ſeptem existit.</hi> I humbly conceive the Holy Ghoſt uſes this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
<hi>[he is of the ſeven]</hi> to take us off from imagining that
this Beaſt (though he be the eighth) is the eighth head of Rome:
No, ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, he is of the ſeven, and that you
might not imagine this Beaſt, on the other hand, to be one of the
ten horns ſubject to Rome; ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>He is of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven;</hi>
and what followes? <hi>And goeth to perdition.</hi> Twice you
have the perdition of the Beaſt mentioned in this Chapter, I
humbly conceive, for two ends: 1. To note that this Beaſt is
the laſt enemy of the Church, which bears up Rome with all her
blaſphemous hypocrites, which vent their poyſon, and profer it
to the world in the golden cup of glorious Goſpell truths, when
they are full of all abominations, and filthineſſe of fornication;
when Romes judgment day is neer, then <hi>v.</hi> 3. doth that ſcarlet co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
blaſphemuus Beaſt ariſe, then is it a year of Jubilee with
Rome, <hi>v.</hi> 5. ſhe is richly adorned and decked with all outward
pomp, and hath a golden cup in her hand, out of which ſhe vents
her abominable blaſphemies. Then hath Rome, <hi>v.</hi> 5. a name
written on her forehead, <hi>Myſtery Babylon,</hi> now <hi>Mystery Babylon</hi>
is legible in her forehead; we ſhall ſee <hi>Babylon</hi> in a myſtery,
when Rome is neer her downfall, as to cry <hi>down with Antichrist,
and murther a King that ingaged to pull down Antichriſt:</hi> To
pretend to promote the Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt, and pull down
the godly Miniſtery. To exalt the Kingdom of Chriſt, and to
grant a toleration of all Religions againſt Chriſt: to plead li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
of conſcience, and deviſe ſpirituall wracks and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
for mens conſciences: For the Brats of Rome to cry
<hi>Down with the Pope, and down with Rome, and down with
Antichrist,</hi> whileſt they promote Rome and the Pope, and
undermine the Goſpell? What is this but <hi>Mystery Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi>
written upon <hi>Rome's</hi> Politicians fore-heads: this is the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:114927:16"/>
comfort, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 24, 30. theſe are the forerunners of <hi>Romes</hi> ruine
By theſe myſterious plots, the Wolves of <hi>Rome</hi> get into the ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
of Chriſt, and ſuck the bloud of Chriſts Flock; and therefore
<hi>ver. 6. John</hi> ſaw <hi>Rome</hi> drunk with the bloud of the Saints at this
time when ſhe was going to ruine: to note, that immediately
before Rome goeth to ruine the Witneſſes muſt be ſlain, for ſhe is
now found drunk with the Saints bloud: And when is this
that Rome is drunk with the Saints bloud (<hi>ver.</hi> 7.) it is when this
Beaſt bears up Rome, that otherwiſe had fallen by the hands of
the Witneſſes, whoſe bloud they now drink: In as much as this
Beaſt throws down thoſe that would have ruined Rome, and had
covenanted ſo to do, he may well be called the Beaſt that bears
up Rome. For certain the tenth part of the City <hi>Babylon</hi> had
fallen, had not this beaſt bore it up, by ſlaying thoſe that had fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
their Teſtimony, and were fully reſolved to pour out their
Vials on Rome: Now when this beaſt goeth to perdition that
bears up Rome, certainly then Rome will fall, when the pillar
that props it up falls, then down it falls: and therefore it is ſaid,
in <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 19, 20. When the Witneſſes ariſe, and put themſelves
under the wings of Chriſt: this Rome-ſupporting beaſt <hi>John</hi> ſaw,
when the Pope and his party, <hi>v.</hi> 20. with him, And when the beaſt
by the Witneſſes (for I have proved already, that the battel is
onely betwixt the Beaſt bearing up Rome, and the Witneſſes) is
overcome: in <hi>ver.</hi> 20. the Pope is taken, and with him the falſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
that wrought miracles: This falſe Prophet is the Beaſt of
the Earth that ſlays the Witneſſes, who is called a falſe Prophet,
becauſe <hi>Rev. 13. 13. He doth great wonders (ver.</hi> 14.) <hi>on purpoſe to
deceive:</hi> ſo that this eighth Beaſt bearing up Rome when Rome
is going to Judgment, when he goeth to perdition, Rome muſt
neceſſarily fall with him.</p>
            <p>2. The Holy Ghoſt in that he calls him (<hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 11.) the eighth
Beaſt, and tells us twice in that Chapter, that 'tis he that goeth to
deſtruction. I humbly conceive the Holy Ghoſt points at <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi>
7. 8. which <hi>Daniel</hi> calls another little horn. <hi>Daniel</hi> longing
to know the meaning of him, the Holy Ghoſt tells him, <hi>'Tis that
horn that ſhall riſe after the ten horns, under the Roman Monarchy,
and ſhall pull three of the ten horns up by the roots, ver.</hi> 8, 21. makes
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:114927:16"/>
war with the Saints, and prevails againſt them: juſt as in <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.
7. <hi>This horn (ver.</hi> 24.) <hi>ſhall ariſe after the ten Kings ſubject to</hi> Rome
<hi>and ſhall be diverſe from them:</hi> In this reſpect he is ſaid to be the
eighth, <hi>Rev. 17. and he ſhall ſubdue three Kings</hi> (i. e.) <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and
<hi>ver.</hi> 11. By the ſetting up of Chriſts Kingdom, the Beaſt ſhall be
ſlain, and given to the burning flame; as <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 20. and 25. <hi>He ſhall
reign untill a time, times, and the dividing of times; and then by the
coming in of Chriſts Kingdom, he ſhall be destroyed to the end, utter
ruine ſhall befall him.</hi> Now who ſhould this little horn be that
riſeth in the end of the Roman Monarchy, and throws down three
Kings, that is, uſurps the Dominion of three Kingdoms, purely
profeſſing the Goſpel, where the Saints whom he perſecutes are,
and reignes tyrannically over the Saints but three years and an
half, and muſt be deſtroyed by the erecting of Chriſts Kingdom,
and putting the Saints in poſſeſſion: but onely the Beaſt which
<hi>John Rev.</hi> 11. 13, 17. and 19. ſetteth forth in his riſing, reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and ruine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But how comes this Beaſt to have ſeven heads, and ten
Horns, ſince he is none of the Roman Heads? in <hi>Revel.</hi> 17.
3, 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> I thought, till I looked into the Original, that the ſeven
Heads, and ten Horns, had related to the Woman, and not to the
Beaſt; and I thought <hi>ver.</hi> 9. would have born me out as well as
the vulgar Tranſlation; but I perceived it not onely claſhing with

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:114927:17"/>
drawing neer to an end) that he is ſaid Rev. 13. to have but two
horns, and here to have ſeven Heads, and ten Horns?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> The ſubject I am now upon is exceeding myſterious: ſo
myſterious, that <hi>John</hi> wondered, with great admiration, to ſee
<hi>Babylon</hi> in a myſtery, devouring the bloud of the Saints, <hi>v.</hi> 5, 6. to
ſee men, under the name of Saints, and tender conſciencious men,
drinking exceedingly of the bloud of the Saints: This is a great
myſtery, and a myſtery to be wondered at; now this myſtery <hi>v.</hi>
7.) the Holy Ghoſt tells us is double: there is a myſtery of the
Woman, that is, Rome; and the myſtery of the Beaſt that at this
time (now Rome is going to ruine) bears her up. Now this Beaſt
is not the Pope, for the Pope ſits as a Whore upon many waters:
This double myſtery then is in thishow the Woman Rome
ſhould come to be drunk now with the bloud of Saints, when
ſhe's going to ruine; and the other part of the myſtery lyeth
in <hi>verſe</hi> 7. how the Beaſt that had horns like a Lamb, and a fair
ſmooth tongue like a Dragon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 11. ſhould now have the
feet of a Bear, and the jawes of a Lyon; how he that had cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanted
to throw down Rome, and profeſſed himſelf a great friend
to the Saints, and yielded all his aſſiſtance to throw down Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
Superſtition, and Idolatry, and holds the ſame Religion in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
that the true Saints do: how this Beaſt ſhould become
the Beaſt bearing up Rome, here is the myſtery, and ſuch a myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
as is to be in the Church when the Witneſſes ſhall be ſlain, and
when Rome is neer to utter ruine, which myſtery being this day
in our eyes revealed, is a ſure prognoſtick to me, that Rome is not
far off from her utter ruine.</p>
            <p>Now I humbly conceive that the Beaſt is ſaid to have the ſeven
heads, and ten horns, becauſe he ſupports Rome with ſeven heads,
and ten horns: Now as the Heathen Emperours were called the
red Dragon with ſeven heads, and ten horns, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 2. and the
Pope is the Beaſt of the Sea with ſeven heads, and ten horns, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they kept up the Emperial pomp and ſtate of Rome: ſo this
Beaſt of the Earth is ſaid here to have ſeven heads, and ten horns,
becauſe he ſupports the pomp and ſtate of Rome, when the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
had finiſhed their teſtimony, and were ready to pour out the
vialls upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:114927:17"/>
This Beaſt is therefore the Eighth, <hi>ver.</hi> 11. becauſe he is diſtinct
from thoſe ſeven Kings, <hi>v.</hi> 10. and yet he is of the ſeven becauſe he
is an Uſurper and a Tyrant, who rules by his Sword-power, as the
ſeven before him did, who bore up the woman with ſeven heads:
the refore this Eighth Beaſt <gap reason="illegible" extent="3+ letters">
                  <desc>•••…</desc>
               </gap>d to be of the ſeven, becauſe of
the likeneſs of the Government he ſets up to theirs before him.
Hence 'tis that in <hi>v</hi> 8. the Beaſt that bears Rome is called the Beaſt
that is not, and ſhall aſcend out of the bottomleſs pit: He was in
the Idaea of his Government, in the Uſurpation of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> but <hi>[is
not]</hi> becauſe he is to come out of the bottomleſs pit, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 7.
where the 1260. years reign of Antichriſt draws towards an end,
and then ſlays the Witneſſes: the next words cleers it, that this
Beaſt is alſo the Beaſt of the Earth mentioned <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 12, 13, 14.
Hence he is called the Beaſt that was, becauſe <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 12. he
makes the people to worſhip the firſt Beaſt whoſe deadly
wound is healed, that is, he makes people ſubject to a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
as <hi>Caeſar</hi> ſet up in Rome, which was a packt company of
Senators, whom he at his command could ſway, to what he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
after he had drove away, and ſecluded the faithfull members
of the Senate-houſe: But by what power doth he do this? the
ſame ver. of <hi>Chap.</hi> 13. tells us, He doth it by the power of the firſt
Beaſt before him, that is, the Pope, (as we have ſhewed) theſe two
firſt Beaſts mentioned in the ſame verſe ſignifie.</p>
            <p>1. The Pope, in whoſe preſence the laſt Beaſt acts, and by whoſe
power he acts.</p>
            <p>And the other is <hi>Caeſar,</hi> whoſe Government he endeavours to
ſet up: Now he doth it by the power of the Pope, that is, by
treachery, lying perjury, treaſon, and lying wonders: Therefore
in <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 8. the time when this Beaſt ſhall be in the world ſhall
be a time of wonder, the people ſhall wonder at him, wonder at
the changes he makes in Times and Laws, and wonder at his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings;
and the reaſon is in <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 13. becauſe he doth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in the ſight of the men of the Earth (that have not rooting in
Chriſt) by his glorious ſucceſſes, and his ſpecious pretences;
and alſo his boaſts of the prevalencies of his prayers with
Heaven, how providence guides him, proſpers, and protects him:
thus he cheats the Pope, and makes them to admire him, for his
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:114927:18"/>
acting by the firſt Beaſts power, that is, by the Popes power, ſo
that this Beaſt is after the Pope, and to be expected (as the Fathers
ſay) when Rome is to go to ruine, and to be deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>Thus this Beaſt is the Beaſt that was, and is not, and yet is.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ob.</hi> How is he the Beaſt that is?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> He is [the beaſt that is] becauſe at that time when <hi>John</hi>
had this Revelation, Rome had the government of <hi>Caeſar,</hi> though
<hi>Caeſar</hi> and that Family were extinct, there was a Senate in Rome,
and that Senate curbed under the power of the ſword, ſword<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
bore the ſway, the General of the Army was the Emperour:
though they had the name of the Senate, they ſate &amp; voted in the
Senate, but it was the General and his ſouldiers acted what they
pleaſed; and in this ſence, this beaſt was in <hi>Johns</hi> time, that is, in
the Government; and in this ſence alſo the eighth is of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
            <p>The hardeſt knot ſtill remains to be untied, and that is <hi>Rev.</hi> 17.
12, 16. where 'tis ſaid, That the ten Horns are ten Kings, which
have received no Kingdom as yet, but receive power as Kings one
hour with the beaſt: What ſhould theſe ten Kings be who have
no Kingdom, nor power, untill this beaſt ariſe, and then they have
but power as Kings one hour with the beaſt?</p>
            <p>1. We muſt anſwer negatively theſe ten Horns here mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
cannot be meant the ten Kingdoms ſubject to Rome (as ſome
would have it) for that is expreſſed in <hi>ver.</hi> 25. Otherwiſe, then by
ten Horns there the head of Rome, the pontifick ſtate, is called the
Whore, and the powers ſubject to Rome compared to Waters,
which Waters are by the Holy Ghoſt in the ſame verſe interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Peoples and Multitudes, Nations and Tongues.</p>
            <p>2. We anſwer poſſibly, yea moſt probably, ten Horns may have
a double ſence and meaning; the one, to ſet forth theſe Kings
ſubject to the Roman Empire, and ſo <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 7. is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood;
and ſo the moſt learned Proteſtant Writers underſtand
theſe ten Horns: 'Tis alſo the opinion of learned men, that by
ten Horns is meant the Senate of Rome, ſubordinate to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall
power of Rome: ſo <hi>Alcazar</hi> underſtands theſe ten Horns,
he calls them <hi>Poliarchiam Senatorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And (not rejecting the common interpretation of the
ten Horns) I conceive this may be the meaning of <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 1. where
when the ſtate of Rome was changed from Emperours to Popes,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:114927:18"/>
the ſeven Heads had blaſphemous Names on them, and the ten
Horns were crowned. The Senate of Rome under the Emperor
had no Crowns; but when the Pope came up with his ten
Horns, that is, his Conclave of Cardinals (reſembling a Senate)
they had their Miters on; here the ten Horns are crown'd: As
I do not dote upon this interpretation, ſo I dare not deſpiſe it,
for it hangs upon as much reaſon as the other, if not more, and I
know no reaſon, but why theſe ten Horns may have a double ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification,
as well as the ſeven Heads; but the ſeven heads (<hi>Rev.</hi>
17. 9, 10.) ſignifie ſeven Mountains, and ſeven Kings.</p>
            <p>Therefore by theſe ten Kings here, <hi>Rev.</hi> 17. 12. I conceive is
meant thoſe Senators, or that packt party, that this Beaſt ſets up
by his ſword power; and as <hi>Caeſar</hi> conquer'd under pretence of
ſubjecting people to his packt-ſenate in Rome: ſo doth this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
Nations and Kingdoms to his packt-party of Senators. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
how clearly this appears in the Text, <hi>v.</hi> 12. 1. The Holy
Ghoſt doth not ſay theſe Kings ſhall receive Kingdoms, but a
Kingdom <hi>[Ten]</hi> is but indifinitly for many; as ten Virgins, ten
Talents; and now theſe many ſhall not reign in diſtinct King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms:
for <hi>John</hi> ſaith they have not received a Kingdom, noting
theſe many Kings ſhalbe in one Kingdom.</p>
            <p>2. They are not abſolute Kings, but receive power as Kings;
they rule and tyrannize, and make Lawes, and exact obedience
from the people as Kings.</p>
            <p>3. 'Tis but one hour that they have this power, three years
and an half is the utmoſt extent of their duration in this power,
for they come in with this beaſt: now this beaſt continues but
three years and an half.</p>
            <p>4. Theſe all make but one vote, <hi>v.</hi> 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that is, in
Engliſh, make one vote. I do not know how better to expreſs it in
Engliſh: therefore I conclude, that theſe are not diſtinct Kings,
but ſuch as vote together in one Councel to propagate the beaſts
deſigns; and in ſo doing, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. they are by the Holy Ghoſt
marked for thoſe who fight with the Lamb, and the Lamb over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes,
ſo that hence I gather, that the great battel ſpoken of to
be fought (<hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 19, 20.) by Chriſt againſt the beaſt, and the falſe
Prophet, is the battel that is to be fought againſt the beaſt, and
theſe ten Horns: For on the Churches ſide the Generall and his
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:114927:19"/>
Army are one and the ſame in both; here he is called the Lamb,
and <hi>Rev.</hi> 19. 7, 8. he is called the Lamb; here he is called the King
of kings, and Lord of lords, and there, <hi>verſ.</hi> 16. he is called King of
kings, and Lord of lords: here his Army is called faithfull and
choſen, and in <hi>ver.</hi> 11. there their Generall (who makes them like
him, by calling them to him) is called faithfull and true. This bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell
is ſet forth, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 13. by a great Earthquake, and <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 19,
20. by gathering the Vine of the Earth into the Vinepreſs of
Gods wrath: a uſuall metaphor to ſet forth the ruine of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
of the Church by, like that in Judges, <hi>The gleanings of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim
are better then the Vintage of</hi> Ebieſar, that is, the little Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts
of <hi>Ephraim</hi> in taking theſe two Princes, were greater then
(the Vintage) the great Conqueſt of <hi>Gideon</hi> over that vaſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</p>
            <p>But here is another hard queſtion comes in, and that is
from <hi>v.</hi> 14. and 16.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Q.</hi> How can it be ſaid in <hi>v.</hi> 13. that the Horns make war with
the Lamb, and the Lamb overcomes them; and in <hi>v. 16. The ten
Horns ſhall hate the whore, and make her naked, and eat her fleſh, and
burn her with fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reſp.</hi> To this we anſwer, Thoſe ten Horns cannot be the ſame
in perſon, in <hi>v.</hi> 14. with theſe in <hi>v.</hi> 16. 1. Becauſe theſe in <hi>v.</hi> 14.
make war againſt the Lamb; but thoſe in <hi>v.</hi> 16. make war for the
Lamb. 2. Thoſe in <hi>v.</hi> 14. are deſtroyed and overcome by the
Lamb, and therefore cannot be the ſame in perſon with thoſe in
<hi>v.</hi> 16. becauſe they ſhall hate the Whore: Now comes in the
Judgement of the Whore ſpoken of, <hi>v.</hi> 1. and in this, <hi>v.</hi> 16. the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
that ſhall bring her to Judgement are ſet forth. Obſerve but
the oppoſition that the Holy Ghoſt puts betwixt the perſon and
perſons in one Office: by the ten Horns (as I have ſhew'd) ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
a Senate, a Parliament, or a ſupream power conſiſting of many
Members: This <hi>v.</hi> 14. and 16. (if ſeriouſly peruſed) ſhew us, that
there ſhall be a great Rent amongſt perſons conjoyn'd in one
office; the ten Horns, <hi>v.</hi> 12. ariſe with the beaſt; but the other (<hi>v.</hi>
17.) give their Kingdom (through their overſight to the beaſt; ſo
that theſe clearly are diſtinct: for theſe laſt ten Horns had a
Kingdom, or elſe they could not give it away; but the other <hi>v.</hi>
12. come to be Kings, or as Kings with the beaſt: ſo that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:114927:19"/>
up of theſe is the caſting down of thoſe (<hi>verſ.</hi> 17.) untill the
words of God be fulfilled: Thoſe ten Kings <hi>verſ.</hi> 13. give their
power and ſtrength (which they received from the beaſt) to the
beaſt againſt the Lamb. But thoſe ten Horns <hi>v.</hi> 17. give but their
Kingdom for a time, and when that time is fulfilled (<hi>i. e.</hi>) when
the ſeventh Trumpet ſounds, when the myſtery of God ſhall be
finiſhed or fulfilled, then thoſe ſhall hate the Whore, and <hi>ſhall
make her deſolate, and eat her fleſh, and burn her with ſi<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e:</hi> This gives
us a moſt clear deſcription of the ſlain Witneſſes, by a party ati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
out of their own bowels: Here are the ſame ten Horns for
the beaſt againſt the Lamb, and the ſame ten Horns for the Lamb
againſt the Beaſt, and the Whore: This is a myſtery which hath
been locked up from former ages, and is now in the eyes of all the
world revealing it ſelf: theſe ten Horns therefore are diſtinct in
their perſons, and the ſame in office, onely the one party ſides
with the Beaſt who gives them his power to ſlay the Witneſſes:
ſo that theſe reigning, keep the name and power of a Parliament,
and ſo they are called the ten Horns, and this Rome they keep
till the true Parliament (which pretendedly was on the beaſts
head) ariſe, and by their powerful proſecution of their Covenant-Reformation,
ſhew their hatred to the Whore, <hi>make her deſolate,
eat her fleſh, and burn her with fire:</hi> For certain the riſing of the
ſlain Witneſſes ſhall be the downfall of the Beaſt, the Pope, and
the Devils Kingdom: I am not ignorant how remote I am from
the common received opinions of the Proteſtants; neither am I
ignorant, how far they are from the clear light of ſacred Text,
which gives too much occaſion to the Romiſh party in their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings,
to ſcorn at their interpretations: It were eaſie to ſhew the
contradictions that they make, who interpret theſe ten Horns to
be the ten Kings of Europe: but I forbear, and only make this the
excuſe of my prolixity, becauſe I eaſily perceive the great ſtone
which the Proteſtant Writers ſtumble at, is this laſt beaſt that is to
riſe and raign three years and an half, in which time he ſlays the
Witneſſes: This Beaſt few of them (for ought I can perceive) ever
dream't of; therefore they miſtake the Beaſt riſing out of the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs
pit, <hi>Rev. 11. 7. the Beaſt of the Earth,</hi> Rev. 13. 11. <hi>and the
eighth Beaſt, Rev.</hi> 17. 11. to be the Pope, and theſe ten Horns to be
the ten Europian Kingdoms, which are all groſs miſtakes, and the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:114927:20"/>
cauſes of greater in moſt of their Writings. Having thus (by the
good grace of the Holy Trinity) by theſe myſterious Texts diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
this laſt Beaſt, and theſe laſt Enemies of the Church, I truſt
he that is not ſpiritually blind will ſay, <hi>Surely theſe Scriptures are
fulfilled in our eyes this day.</hi> Was there not a glorious Reformation
began, and though with much danger and difficulty, yet) clearly
carryed on: Read but the Aſſemblies Works; read the good Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances
made by the Parliament for the carrying of it on; read
the Covenant, and then ſay, whether there was not a glorious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
began: nay did not the King give his Royall aſſent to
this Reformation, and did not the Parliament cloſe with theſe
Conceſſions; and then, even then, on a ſudden when theſe Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
had finiſhed their Teſtimony, then ariſeth this Beaſt, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
throws this Reformation, by ſlaying the Witneſſes which had
finiſhed their Teſtimony: By this the Reader may ſee my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence,
upon Scripture-bottome, that theſe are the times,
and this is the place, and the Magiſtracy, and Miniſtery
of <hi>England,</hi> are the witneſſes that now are ſlaying; and this Power
now tyrannizing over the Church, is that Power that ſlayes the
Witneſſes; and the Beaſt that ſet up this Power, together with
the Power that he hath erected, ſhall gather all their ſtrength a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Lamb, that is, againſt the true Saints, which in ſincerity
worſhip Chriſt; and there the mighty hand of God ſhall appear
to the utter ruining and confounding of them; then ſhall the
Witneſſes ariſe and take up that Reformation which hath lien
dead three years and an half, and ſhall carry it on without any
more oppoſition; and all this ſhall begin to be done (I do not
ſay finiſhed) neere about this preſent year, 1651. Theſe I
have more largly diſcourſed of in the enſuing Tract, yet not at
large, becauſe I expect to have it anſwer'd by ſome of the Time-ſerving
Champions, eſpecially Docter <hi>Homes,</hi> whom I take to be
the learned'ſt Saint of them all in this ſtudy; and he hath got him
almoſt as great a name amongſt the ignorant Crew for a Prophet,
as <hi>Lillie</hi> the Hedg-Prophet, who Jiſpſie-like gets his living by tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
fortunes: as <hi>Lillie,</hi> ſo doth this Doctor make his Oracle ſpeak
to the humour of the Times: as that infamous Prieſt of <hi>Apollo,</hi>
out of baſe flattery made the Oracle <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. So doth the blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous

               </gap>, that is, to humour the uſurping Trayterous
bloudy Hereticks of the Times, and with more ſubtilty then any
of his fellows.</p>
            <p>It behoveth Chriſtians to obſerve ſome mens Deſigns more
then others, and to obſerve how they carry on their Deſigns; as
for this Doctor he undertakes to prove the fouleſt actions that
ever were committed by Chriſtians, to be the gloriouſeſt
and greateſt actions that ever were performed by Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
and pretends to fetch all his proofs from ſacred Scripture,
from Propheticall Texts; and 'tis commonly taught, That
King <hi>Charles</hi> who was cut off was the Antichriſt, and <hi>London</hi> the
city that muſt be deſtroyed with ſeven hills; and the Presbytery
the Locuſt that muſt be deſtroyed; ſo that ere long we ſhall have
Proteſtants maſſacred as Antichriſtian; 'tis therfore time to look
after ſuch fellows. Indeed there are many in print, who aſſume
<hi>ſcribendi libertatem</hi> (as <hi>Scaliger</hi> ſaith of the French) but have
not <hi>ſcribendi facultatem.</hi> I think the Writers of theſe times up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
this ſubject, edged with the Doctors deſignes, may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,
as maladies are amongſt the learned; ſome are privative,
ſome are poſitive; in ſome there is <hi>ſeminarium ſtultitiae,</hi> in other
ſome <hi>ſeminarium invidiae:</hi> Now the later of theſe is moſt dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous:
From hence proceeds hereſie and apoſtaſie from truth;
if we mark it, error is a poſitive act; and where it meets a mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
heart, and a ſubtill head, it doth infinite hurt. Now I ſhall
ſooner prove the Doctor one of theſe, then ſtile him one.</p>
            <p>As for that other ſort of Prophetick time-ſervers, though 'tis
true there be <hi>unus utrique error,</hi> yet, poor ſoules, they make ſuch
ridiculous nonſenſe of what they ſteal from learned men, that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
man of ordinaryparts cannot but cry out of them as <hi>erudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti
fures,</hi> and deſerve as much to be ſlighted, as <hi>Iohn Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wins</hi>
Songs to be laught at. The truth is, ſuch ſelf-conceited ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots
deſerve better to be met with a Lacedemonian whip, then to
be corrected by a ſober pen: They are ſuch as <hi>Hierom</hi> complains
of, <hi>Qui loqui neſciunt, &amp; tacere non poſſunt;</hi> I do not mean onely
ſuch tinkling cymballs and crackt trumpets as <hi>Sterrey</hi> and <hi>Powell,

Simſon,</hi> and <hi>Carpenter</hi> the converted Jeſuite, with his Brother
<hi>Tillam</hi> the blaſphemer; but many others, poor ſoules, who are
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:114927:21"/>
great Zealots againſt Antichriſt, but know not what he is: a man
that hears the contradictions, abſurdities and egregious falſities
that they impudently utter ſometimes in one houre, would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
as (<hi>Lactantius</hi> doth againſt the Philoſophers) <hi>Aut ſtulti

empty-headed fellowes, whoſe privative malice proceeding of
ignorance, makes them belch forth ſuch indigeſted crudities, I
would intreat good Chriſtians to pray for them, for they know
not what they ſay.</p>
            <p>But while I am viewing the followers of the Beaſt: There is a
third ſort of time-ſervers, the worſt of all, by how much the
more eminent they are for the profeſſion of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
for that of <hi>Iuvenali</hi> is true:
<q>
                  <l>Omne animi vitium tantò conspectius in ſe</l>
                  <l>Crimen habet quantò major qui peccat habetur.</l>
               </q>
Theſe are not ſuch laſcivious Goats as the Doctor that I deal
with, nor ſuch ſilly hogs as thoſe I paſs over, who like thoſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
run in a Herd together down the precipice of Ruine into
the Sea of perdition, without remorſe or ſtop: But theſe are men
of gravity, men of ſobriety, men profeſſing outwardly godlineſs,
men that, like <hi>Judas,</hi> kiſs Chriſt with their lips, and imbrace
Chriſts murtherers in their arms, that have their lips in Heaven,

Indeed my ſtyle and my method may juſtly be blamed, I am

not that it was ſtudied in haſt, but ſcribed in haſt: it is well known
this piece proffer'd to the Preſs within a month after the Doctors

<hi>Jure Divino,</hi> and to be viſible in the Church from the Creation to
Chriſts Incarnation, who was both Monarch (by a right of ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
from <hi>Adam</hi>) of the whole world, and by right (of ſucceſſion
from <hi>David</hi>) King of the Jews, according to the fleſh: I have not
handled this point, or any other, ſo fully as I might and could, I
intend it not, untill I hear what my Antagoniſts ſay againſt me;
and then I ſhall (by Gods good grace) ſay more upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
if need require, not otherwiſe; for I hate coming in print, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
in a caſe of neceſſity; and in that caſe onely privatly. I hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily
praiſe God that I have ſo fair an opportunity to declare my
ſelf in this of Monarchy, for at leaſt ſeven years ago, I was unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſlander'd by thoſe ingrateful wretches whoſe family and goods
I protected) that I ſhould ſay that I would kill the King. This
news, and my name, was carryed to the Court, where it met with
His Majeſties ear as He was at dinner: there it was told him that
I (naming me by name) was the man that had vow'd the Kings
death where ever I ſaw him.</p>
            <p>This doubtleſs had died away, and never come to my ears, had
not this accident hapned; he gouty good Gentleman of the houſe
(where the King at that time kept his Court) though he could
neither ſtir hand nor foot, by reaſon of his age and diſeaſe, yet
was ſo inraged at the news, that he vow'd, as decrepit as he was,
to be the man to fight with, and kill ſuch a rebellious villain
(meaning me) as would attempt ſuch a thing. I never had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
to vindicate my ſelf from this foul aſperſion, nor ſo
much as to preſent hearty thanks to the Gowty Gentleman for
his hearty and loyall affections to his Soveraign the King, in that
he would adventure his life to kill a villain that ſhould attempt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:114927:23"/>
to kill the King. I profeſs before God and Men, that I, when I
was ſo aſperſed, was of this opinion, That he was both a Villain
and a Traytor and deſerved ſudden and cruell death, that would
preſume in his heart to think ſo evil a thought as to kill the King:
for my own part I had rather be a ſlave to my Liege Soveraign,
then a Ruler amongſt the Rebellious.</p>
            <p>I am througly convinc'd, that Monarchy is that Government
which God hath ordain'd and ſet his ſtamp upon; and all other
Government is the Ordinance of man immediatly, though ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by God, as the Seventy were under <hi>Moſes,</hi> and that no
perſon upon earth can by Gods law queſtion or bring to puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
the perſon of a Monarch. This we all know, both Jews and
Gentiles, that hold the Divinity of the Scriptures, that the Church
of God (before Chriſt) was beholding to a Monarch, both for
their Church-Laws and State-Laws. For the Revelation of the
Will of God, and the manner of his Worſhip, <hi>Moſes</hi> the Monarch
was the firſt mediator, into whoſe hands the firſt glorious Goſpel
diſpenſations were put. God revealed himſelf immediatly to
<hi>Moſes,</hi> and the people received Gods mind immediatly from
their Monarch <hi>Moſes.</hi> The firſt Revelation of the Covenant of
Grace was given to <hi>Adam</hi> the Monarch of the World: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
manifeſtation of the Covenant, with a Seal, was given to
<hi>Abraham</hi> the Monarch of the Church, and the Goſpel-Church re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
all their ſpirituall Lawes and Ordinances from Chriſt the
natural Son of both: But now the queſtion will be, Whether
Chriſt ordained Monarchy in the Goſpel Church, as well as the
Miniſtry: if ſo, ſhew us the Monarchy, I acknowledg this a difficult
queſtion, I do not find any of the Learned ſo much as touch upon
it: indeed I find many men in the Negative, but ſcarce one Affir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mative
in this Queſtion; I find (though not directly) <hi>Hierom</hi> and
<hi>Calvin</hi> negative in the Queſtion, That Chriſt ordained a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and that <hi>poteſtas &amp; ordo,</hi> power and order, are eſſentiall in
that Government, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o Divines do deny; but the <hi>Modus &amp; titu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi>
in this government, is that which as yet lies diſputable. Some
ſay this government ought to be Ariſtocraticall: Of this opinion
is that holy and learned <hi>Calvin</hi> (which I wonder at) his grounds
for it are becauſe he thinks the ancient government of the Jewes
was Ariſtocratical: but the ſandy foundation of this opinion.
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:114927:23"/>
ſhews us the weakneſs of this Argument: For there is nothing
more clear, then that <hi>Iſraels</hi> government, from their deliverance
out of <hi>Egipt,</hi> to their captivity in <hi>Babylon,</hi> was Monarchical, if Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paemacy
in one be Monarchy; ſo that out of the rains of <hi>Calvins</hi>
Argument will ariſe a firm Argument: Thus if the examples
of Civill-government, under the Goſpel, muſt be according to
that under the Law (for there the force of <hi>Calvins</hi> argument lies)
then Monarchy is the government that muſt be erected in the
time of the Goſpel: but we paſs this. <hi>Hierom</hi> is of opinion,
which he grounds on <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.18. That when the great Day of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-Reformation
ſhall come (<hi>i. e.</hi>) when the Roman Monarchy
is deſtroyed, then (ſaith he) all Kingdoms ſhall be thrown down,
and there ſhall be no government at all, onely the Communion
of the Saints. But this Opinion (as 'tis much built upon theſe
Times, ſo) 'tis built on a ſandy foundation, upon a miſtake in the
interpretation of <hi>Dan.</hi> 7. 18. and it is abſolutely contradictory to
theſe prophetick promiſes of uniting the two Tribes, and the ten
Tribes, under one King or government, (<hi>i. e.</hi>) making them, as at
firſt, one Kingdom under one King; and againſt thoſe Texts
which promiſe to the Jews, That in the Goſpel-dayes amongſt
the Gentile-Goſpellers, <hi>He will raiſe up Kings to be their nurſing
Fathers, and Queens to be their nurſing Mothers,</hi> and many other
texts: therfore we paſs this alſo. The noble and moſt learned He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,
for the moſt part, conclude, <hi>That God will call them again,
and make them a famous Monarchy:</hi> So that the worſt of them
hold, that Monarchy ſhall continue untill the end of the world:
indeed <hi>Levie Ben Gerſon,</hi> an Hebrew, upon the firſt of <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.
pleads for Ariſtocracie; and to advance it, he (like the Serpent)
bites Kingly-Government by the heel: like as the <hi>Prelates</hi> on the
one hand, and the <hi>Independents</hi> on the other hand, plead againſt
<hi>Presbytery,</hi> ſo doth he againſt <hi>Monarchy:</hi> For he picks up the
excrements of the Kings of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and from their ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſavouring
infirmities conclude, therefore their government is ſuch
as their infirmities were, which is ſuch a childiſh weak way of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing,
that it deſerves no anſwer: As if becauſe the Prieſts were
naught, therefore their Office muſt be naught: or becauſe a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
was lame, therefore the Temple was naught: or as if becauſe
the image on the gold is defaced, therefore the gold is naught:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:114927:24"/>
this is peeviſh-childiſhneſs, therefore we paſs that alſo, and come
to the queſtion, Whether Chriſt ordained Monarchy to be in the
Goſpel Church? To that we anſwer negatively, as to the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle.</p>
            <p>1. No King on Earth ſince Chriſts incarnation, to this day, can
ſhew an extraordinary or immediate Call from God to be King,
as <hi>David</hi> could, and <hi>Solomon</hi> could, for he was choſen King, by
God, before he was born.</p>
            <p>2. There is no King, ſince Chriſt, that can ſay he hath a naturall
right to his Kingdom. Succeſſion, that ended in Chriſt, who had
a true Title, by natural ſucceſſion, to be Monarch of the World, as
deſcending from <hi>Adam, Luk.</hi> 3. and a natural right to the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy
of the Jews, as deſcending of <hi>Abraham, Matth.</hi> 1. So that
Chriſt onely is naturally according to the fleſh, by ſucceſſion, the
King of the Jews and Gentiles; and in this ſence is <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 14. to
be underſtood, where <hi>Adam</hi> is ſaid to be a Type of him to come,
that is, as he was Monarch of the World by divine inſtitution, and
naturall right: ſo that he that claims ſince Chriſts incarnation, by
a natural right, the Monarchy of the World, or Kingdom of the
Jews, uſurps the Office of Chriſt; for Chriſt onely is Monarch of
the world by a natural deſcent, and in this reſpect he is both King
and Prieſt after the order of <hi>Melchiſedeck;</hi> for <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi>
was without beginning of dayes, or end of time, in reſpect both of
his Prieſtly and Kingly Office, without beginning of dayes, that
is, in reſpect of his pedegree; for he was both King and Prieſt by
naturall ſucceſſion from <hi>Seth</hi> the ſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> which was time
out of mind; For none at that time were able to tell the
antiquity of his deſcent, who by birth was both Monarch
and Prieſt; and then this <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was without end
of time: For neither the Kingly Office, nor the Prieſtly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
were extinct in the Church untill Chriſt came, in whom met
both the Kingly, the Prieſtly, and the Prophetick Office: this
Chriſt was according to the fleſh the naturall ſon of <hi>Melchiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deck,</hi>
who having carried up to heaven with him his humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ſits a King, a Prieſt, and a Prophet in that nature in heaven
for ever, on his Churches behalf; and in this ſenſe <hi>Melchiſedecks</hi>
offices are without end of time; for our King and our Prieſt is
aſcended up into heaven, where he makes continuall interceſſion
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:114927:24"/>
for us; ſo that ſince him there is no ſucceſſion of Monarchs by
lineall deſcents: but Magiſtracy is not made null under the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell,
becauſe it ceaſeth in reſpect of a naturall title by ſucceſſion
For God hath ordained by his approving providence, other ways
of erecting Monarchs then by ſucceſſion or immediate call, as
<hi>David</hi> was Monarch over the countries round about him, not by
ſucceſſion, nor by an immediate call from God, but by conqueſt;
ſo that the great Office of Monarchy may lawfully come in at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
doors, though the door of ſucceſſion and immediate calling
from God be ſhut. But this is not the queſtion.</p>
            <p>That Chriſt hath not aboliſhed Monarchy under the Goſpel,
nothing is more clear: For government is a morall thing, and
ſtands as ſure as the fifth Commandement: Now Monarchy is
Gods government, therefore it ſtands firm with the fifth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement,
which Laws he came not to make void, but eſtabliſh.</p>
            <p>We may truly argue therfore for Monarchy under the Goſpel
by an argument taken <hi>à fortiori:</hi> For if under the Law God gave
to his Church Monarchicall government, much more doth that
great bleſſing belong to the Goſpel Church, <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts that
<hi>prayers eſpecially be made for Kings,</hi> that they might be converted,
that ſo under them the Church might lead a peaceable life, ſo that
Kings were to be brought in under the Goſpel as well as others.
It is true indeed, there was not immediately after Chriſts aſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
a viſible eſtabliſhed Magiſtracy in the Church, becauſe the
Church was not then eſtabliſhed: Beſides, there was no need of
Magiſtracy at that time, for Chriſt the abſolute Monarch of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
and earth by a true and unqueſtionable title, both by ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
and conqueſt, after his aſcenſion, according to his promiſe,
ſent his holy ſpirit in an extraordinary way upon his twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
who dividing the world amongſt them, went forth in the
power of the Holy Ghoſt conquering the people: During their
time there was no need of any Magiſtracy, for their protection;
for the Holy Ghoſt protected them beyond all the Magiſtracy in
the world; it releaſed them out of the ſtrongeſt priſon, brake
open the ſtrongeſt gates, and knockt down their ſtouteſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as <hi>Paul,</hi> who was doubtleſſe ſome great Magiſtrate amongſt
them; for he was the companion of <hi>Herod,</hi> and when he was
converted, the Church had peace round about; which argues,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:114927:25"/>
there was none before his converſion greater then he: he pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
the ſcandalous, as <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira:</hi> it gave (like a
Monarch) large boons to thoſe that deſired it; it healed the ſick,
gave limbs to the lame, raiſed the dead, and by its imperiall power
made ſpirits of men in every Nation bow down to the Apoſtles
commands: this extraordinary preſence of the ſpirit with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles,
was beyond all the Monarchs in the world; for this Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
ſaved all the paſſengers in the Ship, when the Ship was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
all in pieces, which all the Monarchs in the world could not
do; this Spirit raiſed <hi>Paul</hi> from death to life after he was ſtoned,
which all the powers in the world could not do; therefore there
was no need of a Magiſtracy to protect them in that Age, the
power of working Miracles was their Magiſtracy at this time (ſay
ſome.)</p>
            <p>We may truly affirm, that ſince Chriſts univerſall conqueſt on
the Croſſe, after his Reſurrection, from that day (<hi>Matth.</hi> 28. 18.)
that he divulged this univerſall power in heaven and earth; the
Church hath not been left without a true Monarch, for Chriſt is
that Monarch who gave Commiſſion to his Diſciples to divulge
his Laws, and command the world to obſerve them, and he would
be with his Embaſſadors to the end of the world; ſo that the
true Church cannot be without a Monarch, who by a naturall
right according to the fleſh, raigns over them, and will raign in
the midſt of his enemies, and make all their deſigns promote his
honor, and his Churches good; this grand priviledge only the
Goſpell Church injoys, for the Jews had only temporall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs,
according to the fleſh, who died away, but they had not
a ſpirituall Monarch, who by right of Succeſſion came, whom
(through unbelief) they reject to this day, though for certain he
is their lawfull naturall King, by a naturall right of Succeſſion,
being of the Linage of <hi>David,</hi> and he is our naturall King (we
being Gentiles) by a right of Succeſſion from <hi>Adam;</hi> and he is
ſpiritually the King, both of the Jews and Gentiles, by that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
infinitely glorious Conqueſt, which he got over the Wrath
of God, and his Divine Juſtice, over the Powers of hell, and all
their malice, and over the ſouls of the Elect, and all their ſinnes;
ſo that he is by Conqueſt the Monarch of the Goſpell Church,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:114927:25"/>
ſo that the Church under the Goſpell can never be without a
Throne, and one to ſit upon that Throne.</p>
            <p>In the laſt place, this we do affirm, that ſoon after extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
gifts ceaſed, and that extraordinary Succeſſion of Miniſters
which Chriſt promiſed to be with til the end of the world (<hi>Mat.</hi>
28. 20.) ſucceeded, God raiſed up a civil Magiſtracy for the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting
of the Church, propagation of the Goſpel, and preſervation
of the Miniſtery: This Magiſtracy was viſible in <hi>England</hi> before
any other part of the world; and as <hi>Rome</hi> furniſhed our Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy
with a godly orthodox Chriſtian Miniſtery, ſo not long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
our Magiſtracy furniſhed <hi>Rome</hi> with a godly Magiſtracy, to
reſcue the Miniſtery out of the Jawes of thoſe Heathen Dragons:
<hi>Lucius</hi> about 170 years after Chriſt (being a <hi>Brittiſh</hi> King of

<hi>Rome</hi> terms him) this Chriſtian King ſets up Chriſts Lawes and
Faith in his Kingdom, pulling down Paganiſm, and ſetting up
Chriſtian Biſhopricks in the room of the Pagan Flamins.</p>
            <p>About 130 years after, out of the ſame Royall Brittiſh bloud,
God raiſed up that famous Witneſs for his Truth <hi>Constantine,</hi>
who became the firſt great protecter of the Chriſtians throughout
the habitable world; he was the firſt that made <hi>Rome,</hi> which for a
long time had been the Devils Throne, to become Gods Throne,
<hi>Rev.</hi> 12. He threw down the bloudy Dragons, the Emperours,
and Rome afterward became famous in her Magiſtracy and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
for Chriſt, beyond all the world, untill Antichriſt aroſe,
and drove theſe Witneſſes into the Wilderneſs, and made them
war ſackcloth; ſince which riſing and tyrannizing of Antichriſt,
there hath been a viſible Magiſtracy and Miniſtery in <hi>England,</hi> as
Witneſſes to the Truth of Chriſt, though many times in great
obſcurity through outward perſecutions: it would be here too
tedious to relate what might be ſaid of the Magiſtracy and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery
of <hi>England,</hi> we will onely ſay thus much, that the Kings
and Biſhops of <hi>England</hi> teſtified to the Truth againſt the Popes
Antichriſtian Uſurpation more then others, and before any other
Witneſſes; for about the time, <hi>Anno</hi> 800. when the Popes were
ſwelled to their height, even then ſhall we find (when other
Kings kiſſed the Popes feet) the Kings and Biſhops of <hi>England</hi>
oppoſed their Uſurpation.</p>

What if I did aſſert this? That the firſt lawfull Chriſtian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracy
under the Goſpell aroſe in England, from England it
went to Rome; wherefore a little while (half an hour) it flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
and cauſed great peace in the Church; but when Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt
aroſe, he drove the lawfull Magiſtracy and lawfull Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
of Rome into Sackcloth, and into the Wilderneſſe, that is into
ſome remote place from Rome; obſerve it, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12. 14. The Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
that is, the Church that brought forth ſuch a happy Son as
<hi>Constantine:</hi> this Woman by Antichriſt is drove into the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
(ſaith the Text) into her place; whence I conclude that
England is this Wilderneſſe. For firſt, this was the place from
whence a godly Magiſtracy went unto Rome: and ſecondly, this
was the place unto which the Witneſſes were drove again, where
I ſay have been viſible in ſackcloth ſince the Popes uſurpation of
Rome: nay, let me add this to my aſſertion, that the lawfull
Monarch of Rome by a true Line of Succeſſion was <hi>Charles</hi> the
King of England, who was beheaded on a lofty Scaffold at noon
at his own door, <hi>January</hi> 30. 1648. For if noble Sir <hi>Robert Naun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
that learned Antiquary, and noble Lawyer ſay true in his
<hi>Fragmenta Regalia, cap. 1. p.</hi> 2. whoſe words are theſe; Remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
it is, (ſaith he) concerning the violent deſertion of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
houſe of Britains, by the invaſion of the Saxons, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
by the conqueſt of the Normans, that by the viciſſitude of
times, and thought a diſcontinuance (almoſt a thouſand years)
the Royall Scepter ſhould fall back into the Corrent of the old
Britiſh bloud, in the perſon of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. together with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
the German, Norman, Burgundian, Caſtalian and
French atchievements, with the intermarriage which eight
hundred years had acquired, incorporated, and brought back
into the old Royall Line.</p>
            <p>Hence then I prove, if <hi>Henry</hi> VII. were the lawfull
Succeſſor of the Britiſh Kings, then he was the lawfull
Succeſſor of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> King of England, who conquered
Rome; and if <hi>Henry</hi> VII. be the lawfull Succeſſor of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi>
then thoſe lawfully deſcended of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. but
this lawfull Family of the <hi>Stuarts</hi> are lawfully deſcended of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:114927:26"/>
               <hi>Henry</hi> VII. <hi>ergo.</hi> The <hi>Stuarts</hi> are the lawfull Succeſſors of
<hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, the firſt Chriſtian Emperor of Rome:
there are very many other waies which to ſome ſeem clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
whereby to prove this truth? If ſo, know! Oh Rome,
that the Lion of the North, thy lawfull Emperor and true
Chriſtian Magiſtrate, will ſuddainly ariſe to the utter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
of that bloudy uſurping Prelate, which by his ſubtill trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries
hath cauſed the lawfull Magiſtrate, the lawfull Emperor
of Rome (drove into this Wilderneſſe, where in ſackcloth the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
hath continued, having finiſhed that prophetick teſtimony in
the year 1648.) to become a ſlain Witneſſe for Chriſt: the other
office of the Miniſtery lying dead ever ſince, but the three years
and an half of their lying dead is almoſt expired, and then the
ſame Offices ſhall ariſe to the eternall ruine of the Pope, and
Popiſh Idolatry: but no more of this in this place, I hope ſome
Antiquaries will be ſo truly Noble, that they will plead a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed
Kings cauſe, and clear this Title of his, which is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
to them an eaſie thing, and may procure them great renown
in after Ages; for my part I ſhall ſay no more of it in print,
unleſſe I am challenged, and then if no body will take up
the Cudgells in the Quarrell, I am reſolved, <hi>neque clipeum
objicere, neque cauſam deſerere,</hi> though indeed I have as
much upon my weak arme as I am well able to beare, well
able to doe I ſay? I profeſſe my ſelfe (as in the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking,
ſo in the defending of ſo great a cauſe as I have
taken in hand) utterly unable without the Divine hand to
ſupport me: The reaſon why I have diſcourſed ſo much of
Monarchy is, becauſe I am fully perſwaded that the great
Reformation to be wrought amongſt Jewes and Gentiles,
ſhall be wrought by Monarches, when God ſhall open the
eyes of the Jewes, to know aſſured that the Lord Jeſus is
their true and naturall Monarch according to the fleſh,
and their naturall Prieſt, that is, by Birth-right, as <hi>Melchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedech</hi>
was; then ſhall they look on him whom they have
pierced, and mourn over him, they ſhall then be converted:
Now this converſion is deſigned in that Goſpell Epiſtle writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
to the twelve Tribes, called the Epiſtle to the Hebrewes,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:114927:27"/>
As the knowledge of their true Monarch and Prieſt ſhall work
wonderfull converſion amongſt the Hebrews, ſo the knowledge
of a lawfull Magiſtracy and a lawfull Miniſtery ſhall work
a wonderfull change at the ſame time amongſt the Gentile
Churches, who are now overwhelmed with the cruell tyranny of
the uſurping Prelaticall power of <hi>Rome:</hi> A lawfull Monarch ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
ſhall be the inſtrument of a glorious Goſpel-reformation, of
reſtoring the Witneſſes, and of the overturning of the Roman
Empire in its pontifick Head. Much of this opinion is that Dutch
Divine in his <hi>Clavis Apocalyptica,</hi> to whom <hi>Iohn Durie</hi> the Scotch
man binds himſelf as in a Dutch duell, where he falls to ſtick and
ſnee with him; for ſaith the Dutch Divine in <hi>pag. 89. A high Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentate
amongſt Evangelicall Profeſſors ſhall ariſe, and be exalted,
to the terror of the Papiſts, and ſhall open again a free courſe to the
Goſpell, and reestabliſh the exiled and oppreſſed Gospellers.</hi> And <hi>Iohn
Durie</hi> out of the ſootie region of a dark intellect, gives us this
dark notion in <hi>p.</hi> 70. (which he cals the Preface to this Dutchmans
Book, intending that the Reader ſhould put on his black ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
to read the Dutchmans white Booke withall.) <hi>I believe</hi> (ſaith
<hi>John Durie) that we ſhall not have any great earthly Potentate at
all ever to appear for the Lamb in this battell, but that they ſhall
joyn alwayes againſt the lamb-like nature of the Saints, to oppoſe
and deſtroy it.</hi> How can two be more contrary? I muſt leave them,
though I leave <hi>Iohn</hi> in the dark, who participates more of the man
of his countrey, then of the nature of his Countrymen.</p>
            <p>There are ſome queſtions that betray ignorance, rather then
diſcover wit, as this; ſay ſome, How can it be ſaid that in <hi>Henry</hi>
8. dayes when the Abbies were pulled down; in <hi>Q. Elizabeths</hi>
dayes, when the Kingdom it flouriſhed, and Religion proſpered
and was countenanced; and ſo in King <hi>Iames</hi>'s time; How can
the Witneſſes be ſaid then to be in ſackcloth?</p>
            <p>In part we have anſwered to this elſwhere; but let ſuch take
this as one great part of the anſwer, let them read diligently the
hiſtory of our Nation ſince <hi>Henry</hi> the ſevenths time, and obſerve
the counterworkings of the Pope againſt the Proteſtant Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers,
and they will ſay they were in ſackcloth.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude this Preface with a ſhort diſcourſe of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
reformations, not ſo much by way of information, as premo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
to him whom it concerns.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:114927:27"/>
The objects of every reformation have either been civill <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtick
matters. A civill reformation hath reſpect either to
the offices in the State, or to the Laws in the State: the office of
State in the Head hath been unqueſtionable in all ages, except in
times of rebellion or uſurpation; and then, not the office, but
the perſons in the office have been aſperſed and queſtioned; In
all which ungodly actions, the Pope, and the Popiſh Clergie al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
had a hand. Indeed the Popes have grapled with the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy
of Kings, and uſurped a ſupremacy in this Kingdom o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
the Kings in Eccleſiaſtick affairs, and in that reſpect their offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
have been queſtioned, but the Kings of <hi>England</hi> never yeeld<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
up their right to the Pope, but kept the ſupremacy of Church
and State affairs in their own hands, not only ſince the Norman
line came in, but in the time of the Saxon Kings, as appears by
many of their Lawes and Charters which reſpect the Clergie,
wherein the King, as Head of the Church, doth <hi>Eccleſiastica au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritate</hi>
diſpoſe of the Rites of the Church, and the great Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
thereto belonging, promoting ſome, and debarring others,
whom they pleaſe, from the office of Archbiſhop or Biſhop. This
ſupremacy the Norman Kings kept, which was moſtly the ground
of this quarrell betwixt the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and the Popes;
who were the cauſe of the Engliſh Kings wearing Sackcloth; for
the Popes never ſuffered them to live quietly, but alwayes either
raiſed their own ſubjects to rebell againſt them, or foraigne Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
to invade them; but moſt commonly the Pope ſets the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Houſes againſt the King; for there the Pope kept the Band<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dogs
to werry Royalty, when it oppoſed this ſupremacy.</p>
            <p>The inſolency, ſtrength and wealth of the Clergie cauſed acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally
a reformation in the Church, (which is the proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of a reformation) now this muſt be premiſed before we can
proceed. We muſt know that <hi>Lucius</hi> the firſt Chriſtian King,
when he erected Biſhopricks, he gave eſtates to thoſe Archbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops
and Biſhops which he placed in the Kingdom: he did but
according to the light of nature in it: For the Pagan Prieſts had
means allowed them: The three Archflamins and the twenty
eight Flamins of the Pagans the King turned into ſo many Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhopricks
and Biſhopricks: Afterwards the Saxon Kings erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
many more religious Houſes, Chanteries, Monaſteries, Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talls,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:114927:28"/>
and to which livings were given for the maintenance of
the Miniſtery, and relief of the poor, the giving of theſe livings
was not the perſon that was ſowed in the Church as ſome have
erroniouſly conjectured. Theſe Church-lands anciently were
called by their right name, Appropriations, becauſe they were
appropriate to a particular Succeſſion of Clergy-men, which
were of ſeverall Orders and Houſes, each of which made a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Politique, and obtained either of the Pope or of the King,
that their Succeſſors (ſuppoſe the Incumbents, Priors, Abbots,
or Prebends) might without inſtitution or induction of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
be perpetuall Incumbents<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that as one of them died
his Succeſſor might forthwith enter into his place: Hence they were
called Appropriations. When the Clergy had appropriated theſe
livings to themſelves, they grew idle, laſcivious, proud, rich, and
rebellious, inſomuch that the Pope for the moſt part, making
them of his Faction, curbed the King of England in his own
Dominion: whereupon <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. partly to ſecure himſelfe
from the inraged Pope, but chiefly for the profit of the Abbies
and religious Houſes pull'd them down, which that he might do
effectually, and with much applauſe he ingaged the Lords and
Commons againſt them, who envying their pride and wealth,
were eaſily drawn to concur with the King in the ſame: And
that they might gain a party in the Clergy, this work of pulling
down Abbies was reported as the onely high way to a Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Religion, (and indeed there was a great alteration in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
for the better) Hereupon the <hi>Magistri novae Diſciplinae,</hi>
the Maſters of new Diſcipline (theſe were the Proteſtant Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines)
they were embraced by the King, (juſt as the Presbyterians
were by the Parliament, when they took away the Biſhops lands)
the King made large promiſes, untill the Parliament had confer'd
the Church-land upon him, and then the Maſters of the new Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline
were as much ſlighted as the Presbyterians are now; and
thus appropriations become impropriations, juſtly ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were put into improper hands; Lay-mens hands. From
this Diſcourſe, I draw theſe two inferences.</p>
            <p>1 All the Reformations, as yet, have been but ſackcloth Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations.</p>
            <p>2 'Tis a land-devouring, King deſtroying, God-provoking,
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:114927:28"/>
Soul-damning ſin, to be guilty of Sacriledge: Let that King then
that looks for a bleſſing from God, make conſcience of reſtoring
that to the Church which is her due, notwithſtanding long de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
from her: Let no man think that I plead for my ſelf in
this, for I am no Clergy man: I muſt break off here abruptly, for
the Printer grutcheth at my prolixity. The bleſſing of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Trinity be upon thee (<hi>Reader</hi>) in reading this and the enſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
