         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>The VOICE of the Lord, ſaith, CRY.</head>
            <p>ANd what ſhall I Cry, Oh! the day of the Lord God haſteneth, and is coming upon all proud Fleſh, upon the Lofty and the High-minded, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all the tall Cedars; and the Sword of the Lord God is drawn to cut down all fruitleſs Trees: And this is the Cry of the Lord God of Heaven, which is gone forth againſt you unjuſt <hi>Juſtices,</hi> with all the falſe <hi>Judges,</hi> with whom we are to contend for the Truth and Faith of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is come again with Power and great Glory; againſt whom, the Rulers and the Judges of the Earth take Counſel, who are combinding together againſt the Lord of Glory, and his holy Anointed, who are bleſſed for ever: And this is the day of the Lord God, wherein we warn you, again and again, to repent of your evil Deeds, your Works of Darkneſs, which you are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king in the Night which is over you.</p>
            <p>Behold thick Darkneſs hath covered you, and the Clouds of the Night hath infolded you, and your Eyes are yet blinded, that you cannot ſee the Signes of the Times, nor yet diſcern the Coming of the Son of Man; ſurely, if you did but ſee the glimerings of the day of God, you would not thus make War againſt his glorious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: A <hi>Lamentation</hi> could I take up for you, as the Lord Jeſus did over <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> of old, who <hi>killed the Prophets,</hi> who <hi>ſtoned them that were ſent to Preach Repentance,</hi> over whom he wept and ſaid, <hi>Oh Jeruſalem, Jeruſalem! that killeſt the Prophets, and ſtoneſt them that were ſent unto thee;</hi> do you not do the ſame, who are Halling and Perſecuting, and Impriſoning the innocent People, who fear the Lord God, and for no other thing do Suffer for, but for Truth, and for Righteouſneſs ſake; a woful Day is coming upon you all from the righteous God of Heaven, who hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to bring it, and it is even at your doors, although you will not believe it, although it be declared unto you; you Deſpiſers and Wonderers, you ſhall ſurely periſh if you Repent not; and as ſure as the Lord liveth, he will plead with you, by the Sword of his Eternal Vengeance; and woe unto you who are decreeing unrighteous Decrees, who are ſeeking by all ſubtilty to enſnare the Juſt; but away with your Abominations, we ſee the ſubtilty of the Devil, whoſe Servants ye are, and ſo we may call you, as Chriſt did your Fore-fathers, who ſaid, they <hi>were of the Seed of</hi> Abraham <hi>their Father,</hi> but they were of their <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Devil,</hi> whoſe <hi>Works</hi> they did.</p>
            <p>The ſame you do now, and the Vengeance of God muſt come upon you, then ſhall you ſee the King of Glory appear in Flames of conſuming Fire, rewarding you, the Workers of Iniquity; then ſhall the witneſs of God be awakned in every one of your Conſciences, although it be now as it were aſleep, although the Son of God is ſlain in the Streets of <hi>Sodom,</hi> when the Blood of the Covenant is trampled under by you the uncircumciſed in Heart and Ears, who cannot indure the Truth when it is ſpoken; but there is a witneſs of God in every Conſcience of you; this you ſhall know awakned in the Day that is coming, and this ſhall ariſe to your Condemnation, and then your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences condemning you, God is greater, and will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you alſo; and then whither will you fly? I tell you the Mountains ſhall not cover you, neither ſhall the Rocks hide you from the Flames of his Wrath, when he appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to Judgement: Therefore you <hi>Judges</hi> on Earth come forth, ariſe you Dead to the Judgement of the great day of the Lord God, who is ariſing to Judge you according to your Works; therefore I ſay in the Power of the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, and by his holy Spirit, you ſhall be unthroned, and thrown down, the mouth of the Lord of Hoſt hath ſpoken it; and your Kingdom ſhall be laid waſte, and your dwelling Places made deſolate without Inhabitants; your Habitation is a habitation of unclean Spirits, the Devil keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth your Houſe, by whoſe Power you Rule; but woe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Earth, and to the Sea, for the Devil is come down, having great Rage, becauſe his Kingdom is to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and woe unto the Rulers of this preſent Age, who are Veſſels of Wrath, who are fitted for Deſtruction, in whom the Prince of this World lodgeth, and by his Power you think to make the Sons of God bow; nay, the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the heavenly Power in which we ſtand, ſhall bind you all, you Kings and Princes of the Earth; the Dominion of our God raigneth over Hell and Death, and above you, in the King of Heavens Authority, and you ſhall bow and bend unto the Power in which we dwell; and the Lord God hath put it into my Heart to expoſtulate this matter, and to contend for the Faith and Truth of the Lord Jeſus, againſt whom you Rulers of the Earth are taking Counſel, and making War againſt; but your Counſellor God will confound, and your Counſels ſhall be daſht in pieces, and your unrighteous Decrees ſhall be confounded, and you ſhall never be able to make an end of the Work which you have begun, it will be too pondrous for you; and this Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony we have to bear for the living God, againſt you the Oppreſſors of his Truth; and Truth and Righteouſneſs ſhall be again eſtabliſhed in the Earth, although it is become a Sting and a Torment, yet the Truth, the living Stone ſhall daſh you to pieces, and grinde you to powder; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tremble, dread and fear the God of Hoſt, who will terribly ſhake the Foundations and Pillars of the Earth, before whom you ſhall <hi>Quake</hi> and <hi>Tremble;</hi> then ſhall you know that the God of the <hi>Quakers</hi> is a conſuming Fire, which will render Vengeance upon you all, whoſe day you ſhall not eſcape.</p>
            <p>Therefore I ſay tremble, Oh Earth, ye <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Rulers</hi> ſtand in awe of the dreadful God, who is coming with thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of his Angels to Judge the World, and you ſhall all know his power to your Everlaſting Deſtruction, if you ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit not to his Government, which is Righteous, Holy and True, and is upon his ſhoulders; and <hi>becauſe of Injuſtice the Land mourns,</hi> and <hi>becauſe of falſe Judgement great is the Oppreſſion;</hi> and <hi>inſtead of Juſtice behold Oppreſſion is found amongſt you,</hi> who are looking for <hi>Bribes,</hi> and <hi>Rewards,</hi> and <hi>Gifts,</hi> which hath blinded your Eyes: And ſo by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitfulneſs of Sin, you are led into Captivity by the Prince of this World, who Ruleth in the Earthly minded, who covets after Earthly things, whoſe Hearts are filled with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean Luſts; theſe are not the Temples of God, but theſe are Veſſels filled with uncleanneſs and abomination, againſt whom the Cry of the Lord is gone forth, who will meet them with ſudden Deſtruction; and the day haſtens, that was never the like, nor ever the like ſhall be after it, the great and notable Day, the mighty and terrible Day, which is near to be revealed; I ſay the like was never, nor ſhall be the like after it, ſo dreadful, ſo terrible, ſhall be the day of God upon his Enemies, that no Fleſh ſhall be ſaved that liveth in Corruption; and <hi>woe</hi> unto the <hi>World</hi> for they ſhall <hi>mourn</hi> and <hi>weep</hi> bitterly, and mens <hi>Hearts ſhall fail them for fear,</hi> and they ſhall run up and down as men amazed, and looking for thoſe things which ſhall come upon the Earth; for the Tribes of the earth ſhall mourn, and great Sorrow and Deſolation ſhall come on all that are found out of the Covenant of the Lord God; and no other hiding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place ſhall be found, but the holy Ark of God, into which the Righteous ſhall enter, but the Wicked and Rebellious ſhall be deſtroyed by Fire and by Sword.</p>
