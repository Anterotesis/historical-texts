            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

the publicke profite, they haue among them Princes, &amp; conductours of their councell, and maner howe to behaue them selues in their frequentations. In the Winter they are hidden, for that they can not resist the Snowes, Windes, and Frostes, they make ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and ware, when they goe to their worke they neuer lÃ©ese no tyme.

On nights in their voyage, when they are fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> their wonted place to rest, they lye their belly vpwarde, to kepe their winges from the dewe.
<pb facs="tcp:10953:48"/>
The maner of their workes is to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maine some of them at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> gate or doore of their Hyue there to kepe watch, as the custome is of a Castle: in the night they rest till the morning, except those that are appointed to watche, of the which one of them in the morning go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth aboute making a sounde or noyse, as it were a Trumpet, and then euery one departeth and flyeth away, if the day be faire, otherwise they continue in their house, &amp; they know the disposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of tymes, the yong ones goe or flye abrode into the fieldes, and the old ones remayne to make the worke, or to deuide the rowmes within. Some bring the flowers to the entrie of their place, others do discharge it, &amp; caryeth it in, others bring water in their throte for to te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>per or giue moysture to their workes, and they deuide their offices. Some do garnish, some pollishe, some sucke, and others make ready foode of that which is brought in, for they liue
<pb facs="tcp:10953:49"/>
together and doe not seperate, to the ende, that equally their foode be deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded: they make double alleyes or pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, some to come in at, &amp; some to goe forth by: the most hony is in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est rowme. If there chaunce to ryse a great winde whylest they are in the fieldes, then they flie close to the grou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>d along the hedges, and they take a litle stone or earth to be more waightier, to the ende the winde beare them not away, and lode their floures in their fore fÃ©ete, against their breastes. Those that are appointed maysters or ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seers of their house, will chastice those that are negligent and slowe. They neuer file nor make filth in their Hiue they are so cleane. In the night their watch being set, they retyre into their lodging, and make a murmuring or noyse, still deminishing till that one maketh the last sounde or Trumpet, flying in the midst of them, and then they ceasse oft al til the morning. First
<pb facs="tcp:10953:49"/>
they make their common houses, and then the house of their king or Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine whome they doe elect and choose. Among these good flyes, there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more greater without sting, whiche serue at the workes, &amp; to chafe or warme y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yong ones betwene their fÃ©ete, and they are straightly corrected, and if they fayle, without any remissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. These make their king a fayre house, pinacled lyke a Castle, sepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from other houses. The lodgings of the common sort, haue sixe rowmes or corners for the worke of their sixe fÃ©ete, and they make them in close, darke, or raynye dayes, and at suche tymes they fill the vpper Celles with hony, and in a fayre &amp; clÃ©ere day they goe to the fieldes. The maner how the yong ones are borne, there is greate defficultie, for thei neuer couer one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother. There was a <hi>Romaine</hi> that made a hiue of clÃ©ere lanterne hornes for to sÃ©e their workes, and it sÃ©emeth
<pb facs="tcp:10953:50"/>
that they make little wormes, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come flyes, and before that they haue feathers, there is nothing that y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> dame desireth more to eat, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> their heades are pulled of. Their king is chosen in euery swarme or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>pany, &amp; they choose hym that is greatest: he is knowen for he hath a spot in the foreheade. If he go or flye to the fieldes, the others fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him as his gard, and he goeth not out of the Hyue vnlesse that al the rest do followe. If he haue a wing broken or perished, he goeth not oute of the Hyue, he onely taketh no paynes, but admonisheth them of their worke. If by aduyse of councel he co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>meth forth, euery one putteth their payne to serue him, and wil carry him if he be weary. If he haue a sting, yet he vseth it not. Whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> they intend to depart &amp; leaue the hiue, certaine dayes before, they mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure and make a noyse, and flye their way by tempests. Often tymes they be at strife for their bondes &amp; floures,
<pb facs="tcp:10953:50"/>
or if one Hyue haue no foode, they wil spoile another, and their king doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fende them. If there want vittayles, they kill or driue away those flyes that haue no sting. If their sting be once broken, they are tamed or faint hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as a gelded body, and can profite no more, such haue places a part for to retyre them. They hate shÃ©epe, for they can scarce get out of their wooll. Also they hate Crabbes or Creuices, and if there be any sodde<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> nere to their place, the smell of them will make them dye. They haue many diseases, and if any of them dye, they bring him oute of their rowmes, &amp; cast him out of their Hyue as making of funerals. If their King dye, they doe more, for then they make such dolor and sorrow, that they do nothing. By this and by to muche taking off of their hony, they die often tymes. They haue sense and vndersta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to heare, and doe reioyce, and at the sound of a Basan they wil asse<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>ble.
<pb facs="tcp:10953:51"/>
When their worke is finished they flie abrode, then retourne to their hyue or house. Their age is seuen yeares, they neuer touch any Carion, as Crowes, Kytes, and other flyes doe. Their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny commeth as it were a sweate from heauen, spittle from the starres, or ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor from the ayre, when in the spring tyme the sayd moysture falleth on the leaues and the Dew, and the BÃ©es re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyueth it, and caryeth it into their byue. The hony at the first is as cleare as water, it boyleth lyke newe wine, and purgeth, the twentie day it fatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, then it hardneth, and casteth a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle skin like a scumme, there is wayes how to get the hony, for want of foode causeth the BÃ©es to disperse and flye their wayes, or die, and to great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance maketh them vnprofitable, for they labour no more than is necessary or nedeful, and therefore the twelueth parte is their porcion that they ought to leaue them. Of hony is made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb facs="tcp:10953:51"/>
medicinable thinges, seruing to eche one. Some leaue the tenth parte, and if it be not ful but almost empty, ye ought not to touche it. That hony that cleaueth together or thrÃ©edeth, is not good, but when incontinently it breaketh in taking of it, it is a good signe. Also the good smelling hony that hath a colour lyke golde, and swÃ©ete in the tast, is a signe of goodnesse. The wilde hony is not so good as the other. Spiders or Spinners haue within them suche fertilitie, that they spinne beginning in the mydst, &amp; they make thrÃ©edes very subtill. They make their yong ones lyke wormes. Scorpions towards the East are very venemous, &amp; they make little wormes like egges, of whiche commeth their yong ones, but in <hi>Italy</hi> they do litle harme. They byte or sting with their tayle. Locusts or Grashoppers make egges, they goe on the ground with their clawes. The <hi>Parthians</hi> doe eate them. Also Ants
<pb facs="tcp:10953:52"/>
make egges, of the which growe their yong ones: and as the good flyes doe congregate their workes, so they hide their foode in the earth, for to liue with in the winter. They haue knowledge howe to deuide the greate graine A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corne, and they dry them that are wet in the Sommer, they worke by night in the full Moone, one commeth to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother for their burthens, &amp; it sÃ©emeth that in them is mutual loue in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence of their worke. Among other beastes they bury one another when they are deade. The Butterflye com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth of a little worme in thrÃ©e dayes, shÃ©e groweth also of woode wherein is humiditie.

<pb facs="tcp:10953:52"/>
And some there are called <hi>Hemorobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os,</hi> that dye that day that they take life. Deade flyes if they be hidden or buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Ashes, will reuiue. All beastes haue their hornes hollowe sauing at the very ende, except the DÃ©ere. Asses in <hi>India</hi> haue one horne. Man alone hath his eares vnmoueable.

The eyes of man principallys doth shewe loue, furor, folly, and wisedome. Great eyes signifie small wit or discretion. The heart lyueth first, and dyeth last. A man hath eight ribbes on a side, the Hog ten, the Serpent thirtie. Among foules the Batte hath tÃ©eth &amp; no other. Man groweth til he be. xxi. yeres olde. Bloud preserueth the life of euery per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son: that being gone no remedy but death. They that haue the thickest and fattest bloude, are the strongest. They

The haire of a mannes bearde commeth not as the grasse in the fielde that is mowed, but it procÃ©edeth from the roote.

And to let the yong Asse take the Dames milke before two dayes, is daungerous. Certaine Dames of <hi>Rome</hi> did bathe them selues in Asses milke, for it maketh their skin smoth and whyte. Milke of Goates is worsse to make chese than the milke of Kyne.

            <p>TRees haue lyfe whiche they take of the earth. There are manye straunge trÃ©es in dyuers countreys, which vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to some are vnknowen. In some pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces they water fine trÃ©es at the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

The <hi>Parthians</hi> which haue trÃ©es bearing wooll, of the whiche is made fine cotton cloth, as it is sayde, haue a trÃ©e bearing Apples, but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> fruit is not to be eate<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>, but they haue a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uellous smell, so haue the barkes, the whiche being in your Chest among your apparell, casteth a sweete sauour or smell: and this trÃ©e hath alwayes fruit, some growing some dying, and some ready to gather, and the graftes of this trÃ©e will take in no other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey. In <hi>India</hi> there is both wood and
<pb facs="tcp:10953:56"/>
trÃ©es that will not burne in the fire. There hath also bene sÃ©ene a Figge trÃ©e of a great height, the braunches of the same trÃ©e to spread sixty paces, and it hath leaues so brode, that the sunne beames can not by any meanes enter betwene, and therfore the fruit of this trÃ©e can not dye, but the shadow of the same is very delectable. There is also in the <hi>Indias,</hi> Apple trÃ©es which haue the leaues thrÃ©e cubites long, and two brode, bearing suche great fruit, that foure men can scarce eate one Apple. The trÃ©es name is <hi>Pala,</hi> the Apples name <hi>Aripa.</hi> Pepper groweth on lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle trÃ©es as doth Ienuper. In y<hi rend="sup">e</hi>

Others that haue their floures, that beginneth in the morning at y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> sunne rysing to open, and at hye noone they are opened, and after noone they begin to close, and so remayne all night till the morning, and the Paysauntes of that countrey say that the trÃ©e slepeth. There is the trÃ©e of <hi>Nardus,</hi> the which casteth a maruellous swÃ©ete smell or odour. And in <hi>Arabia</hi> of trÃ©es growe Frankencense, and Myrre. Franken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense groweth in a Forrest of <hi>Arabia,</hi> in a fruitfull grounde, full of Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynes pertayning to diuers persons. It is a hanging matter amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g>g them to steale any thing. The men doe purifie them selues, and abstaine from wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">Ì</g> for a certaine space, to take or gather the Frankencense, otherwyse they can not profite. On this side the sea it is

mingled with a kinde of Rosen whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che is like, but the difference is know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by the colour, by the breaking, and by the fire, for Frankencense will soner burne, and is soner broken with your teeth. Also there is in those woods of <hi>Arabia,</hi> trÃ©es bearing Myrre, and the Masticke. The <hi>Sabians</hi> burne no other wood, wherefore they are weary of their smell. In the Sea of <hi>Arabia</hi> groweth the <hi>Margets</hi> and other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious stones. Cynamon is the barke of a little trÃ©e, which groweth in great quantitie in base <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> in ful pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces among the bushes, the best is that of the highest braunches, the worst is that that is nearest to the roote. When there is any deawe in the Sommer it is gathered by great defficultie. The trÃ©e hath no smell when it is grÃ©ene, &amp; it is gathered from the Sunne rising, to the Sunne setting.

The lyquor of the Oliue is the Oyle, but is lasteth not as doth Wyne, for it is best the firste yeare. Some there are that tarry till the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liues fall from trees, for it hurteth the trÃ©es agayne the yeare following, to be cutte, broken, or smitten. Olyues before they are rype will be kept wyth salte, after that they haue bene in hote water. If the Oliue be not cleane, it is washed and dryed, thrÃ©e or foure dayes and seasoned wyth salte.
