            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. <hi>Abraham</hi> was not to go to his Fathers, first, <hi>In Body</hi>; the place of his locall Interment, was to be <note n="(a)" place="margin">Gen. 25.7<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <hi>Macpelah</hi> in <hi>Canaan,</hi> and not any other place; secondly, Nor <hi>in Soul,</hi> that removed to the immediate fruition of God in glory; whereas many of his Ancestors were Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators, serving other Gods,<note place="margin">Josh. 24.2.</note> and doubtlesse many of them died in their Paganish condition.</p>
            <p n="2">2 But the sense of this expression is, <hi>Abraham</hi> shall die, that's the meaning of the Hebraism; thou shalt go to thy Fathers, that is, corporall death shall arrest thee as well as it did do them.</p>
            <p>Now if you compare these words with verse the sixt, where wee read that Abraham <hi>beleeved in the Lord, and it was counted to him for Righteousness</hi>; though hee were a beleever in Christ, yet hee must go to his Fathers, that is, hee must die as well as they, this may inform us,
<q>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Abraham</hi> though a Beleever, yea the highest in the forme of Beleevers, being the Father of the faithfull, yet hee must die;<note place="margin">Dan.</note> and it is no wonder, since <hi>the Decree is gone forth from God,</hi> which is farre more irrevocable than the laws of the Medes and Persians. <hi>It is appointed unto all men</hi> (Beleevers as well as unbeleevers) <hi>once to die.</hi> When the <hi>Scripture saith all,</hi>

               <hi>none is exempted</hi>; some indeed have had a writ of Privilege from some kinds of death, yet none from death in the main. <hi>Moses</hi> was freed from the bitings of fiery Serpents, as Magistrates sometimes (through mercy) are privileg'd from death in times of common mortality,<note place="margin">Deut. 34.5.</note> yet death surprized them in the end; for <hi>Moses</hi> the servant of the Lord died in the land of

            <p n="2">2 This <hi>Decree hath made seisure in all Ages,</hi> even where faith hath been in an eminent way, as in <hi>Moses,</hi> witness his undertaking that difficult Embassage to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver <hi>Israel</hi> out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> Faith in the end did eat up all his fears, and engaged him in that difficult work, yet Death at last did arrest him, as was hinted before; so in <hi>Job,</hi> a great Practitioner in the life of faith; that made him draw up this Resolution, <hi>Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>David,</hi> a Beleever, a man after Gods own heart, and yet Death overtook him; and <hi>Paul,</hi> who professed, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me, and the life that I now live, I live by the faith of the Son of God, &amp;c.</hi> yet, did not death surprise him?</p>
            <p>I might be endless here, to shew you how Death at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached Beleevers, both before, as well as under the Law, yea even in the time of the Gospel; had the debt of Sin been taken off, and the Decree rescinded, that Purse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Death would not go on daily to Arrest Beleevrrs at Gods Sute.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>The holiest Beleever hath in his body</hi> the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple <hi>of death,</hi> viz. <hi>sin,</hi> and that entwisted even with his very Nature;<note place="margin">Rom, 5.12.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Bodies of Sin will become bodies of Death, because sin is in the Soul as a Canker at the root, that will kill the Tree, as the Worm that smote <hi>Jonahs</hi> Gourd, that made it wither away; this drew out that Empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Quere,<note place="margin">Psal<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 89<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>49</note>

            <p>Q. 1. <hi>What is meant by Burial?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> Burial speaks nothing,<note place="margin">

               <hi>but the covering of the dead body of man with earth,</hi> or the interring of it.</p>
            <p>Now touching Burial I have nothing to say,<note place="margin">operuit, terra humavit</note> for any thing that savours of the least of Superstition in it, <hi>I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther look upon it if denied by cruel men,</hi> as any badge of Gods Curse to Beleevers, though sometimes he gives way to some such stupendious dispensations, which was the ground of that sad complaint of old, <hi>The dead bodies of thy Servants have they given to be meat unto the Fowls of the Heaven, and the flesh of thy Saints unto the beasts of the earth,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Psal. 79.2</note> 
               <hi>their bloud have they shed like water round about</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and there was none to bury them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Men indeed have discovered much inhumanity this way, especially Papists against Protestants, by prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their Burial, or digging up their bones again, as they did of <hi>Bucer,</hi>

               <hi>Fagius, &amp;c.</hi> such acts savour of wrath in men, but none in God towards them that were in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So neither do I construe it if afforded, or permitted,</hi> as any help to heaven, because upon the dissolution of the body, the Spirit returns to God that gave it, the Soul is admitted immediatly into the embraces of God, though the body be kept above ground divers daies toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet this I may say, upon a Scripture account, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Burial, that the decent interment of the bodies of Saints, when death hath divorced those old compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Soul and Body, speaks</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>Mercy in the Interrers,</hi>

is come to old Age, and one at seventy to gray hairs, after which a man becomes decrepit. This is but his meer Phansie, for how many even with us come to gray hairs before fifty years, some before forty years of age? But to wave this, it is sufficient for us to know, that in the Old Testament they are used as <hi>Synonimaes,</hi> i. e. <hi>words signifying the same thing,</hi> and that by old age we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand, <hi>the winter of mans life,</hi> the <hi>evening,</hi> or <hi>Sun-set of his days, the utmost period of his time on earth.</hi> Other Ages have still another Age to succeed them, as Childe hood is succeeded by Youth, Youth by Man-hood, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood by Old Age, but <hi>old Age hath no other Successor but Death,</hi> it <hi>being the last declension,</hi> or <hi>degree of the longest life.</hi>

            <p n="3">3 Q. How it may be made out for a man to be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in a good old age is a special favour and mercy of God.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>S.</hi> To <hi>be buried at any time savours of some mercy,</hi> as <hi>Jer.</hi> 22.19. it savours of Judgement, to be buried with the burial of an Asse, or to lye uninterred because of sin.</p>
            <p>But <hi>to be buried in a good old age,</hi> we cannot but look upon it as a choyse mercy, <hi>because very few</hi> live to bee old; <hi>look upon an Apple-tree in the Spring,</hi> you may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most see it covered with Blossoms, yet how many fall before they come to knit? and if knit, how many fall yet before they come to be ripe?<note place="margin">Erasmus de contemp. mundi.</note> many are worm-eaten, and they drop; many are beaten down by violent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pests, scarce one of ten, yea twenty, yea sometimes not one of forty comes to its full maturity; <hi>so it is in regard of man,</hi> abundance of Children like blossoms seem to cover the ground, but how few of them live to Youth, fewer to Manhood, fewest of all to old age? but how infinitely farre fewer do live to a good old age? it must needs therefore be a chief Mercy. Is it not a Mercy when we have done our work, then to be called home to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive our Wages? Then to be gathered when here we are fully ripe? then to come to the Grave in a full age, <hi>like a shock of Corn comes in his season?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 5.26.</note> To conclude, is it not a mercy then to be called to make your account, when we have been long a preparing, and making ready for it? <hi>the accounting day to a just Steward is a glad day indeed,</hi> when he can do it with joy, and not with grief; this fills the Soul with panting,<note place="margin">Rev. 22.20.</note> 
               <hi>Come Lord Jesus, come quickly</hi>; because he hath now made his peace with God, and hee


<pb n="26" facs="tcp:57598:17"/>
can now lift up his head,<note place="margin">Luke 21.28</note> because <hi>his</hi> full <hi>redemption draws nigh,</hi> being insured that the day is now drawing on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pace, when he shall hear Christ thus speaking unto him, <hi>Come thou blessed of my Father, inherit a Kingdom provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for thee from the beginning of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But for the improvement of all, take these three words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Vse</hi> 1. To you concerned in <hi>this great, this common loss,</hi> wherein the Daughter hath lost a tender Father, the Grand-children an indulgent Grand-father, the Servants a good Master, the Parish a worthy Parishioner, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation to which he belonged a vigilant Elder, yea the City a great Ornament; I know the loss is great to all related to him, yet to alleviate your grief weigh with me
<list>
                  <item>1 <hi>Gods great mercy to you in sparing him</hi> so long, a Father, a Friend, a Master, a Parishioner, an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that he might be eyes to the blinde, strength to the weak, a cloather of the naked, one that stood often in the gap to divert Wrath from you.</item>
                  <item>2 <hi>Gods mercy to him in gathering</hi> him to his Fathers in peace, admitting him to burial in a good old age.</item>

                     <hi>though we may mourn,</hi> yet we must <hi>not mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure or mourn as them without hope</hi> for him that sleeps in Christ, Lazarus <hi>our friend sleeps,</hi> our deceased friend is only gone to sleep, he will awake again in the Resurrection; could he now speak unto you he would doubtless say, <hi>Weep not for me, but weep for your selves.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2 To <hi>you not only that are concerned in this</hi> loss, but to <hi>all of you that knew</hi> him, take notice of that light part of his Cloud which he held forth long before you, there were many signal things in him worth your imitation.</p>
            <p n="1">1 <hi>His constant attendance upon the Word,</hi> which I obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be in him these ten last Winters, when so many went back <hi>in the late defection</hi> from Ordinances among us, he spake in effect as <hi>Peter</hi> when the Disciples were questioned, <hi>Will yee also go away?

            <p n="2">2 <hi>His real friendliness to all the Embassadours of Jesus Christ,</hi> yea to all where he saw any thing of Christ; he was both open handed, and open hearted to all the needy Members of Christ, and would more gladly do good than receive thanks for the good he had done.</p>
            <p n="3">3 <hi>His sympathising with the Church of God</hi> in all her sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, especially heretofore in the <hi>Palatinate,</hi> and at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in <hi>Piedemont</hi>; as <hi>Lots</hi> Captivity setled on the spirit of <hi>Abram,</hi> so did the miseries of the people of God on his heart,<note place="margin">Es. 22.4.

            </p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>His exemplary Piety,</hi> he taking up the resolution of old <hi>Joshua,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Josh. 24.</note> 
               <hi>I and my house will serve the Lord</hi>; his known Meekness and Humility, though God had cast in a great Estate upon him, yet he was not lifted up; a <hi>meek and quiet spirit in the sight of God is of great price.</hi> I omit his walking in a way of private communion with God, which was best felt in himself, yet he gave many disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries of it to all that came near him that were acquainted with the workings of the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="3">To all of you now that count upon, or desire to come to the Grave in a good old age.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>It may be some of you may be inquiring, what must I do that I may share in this branch of this Promise?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> I shall only give a brief answer unto this, and so dismiss you.</p>

            </p>

            <p n="1">1 Now <hi>presently repent,</hi> repent of sins of Youth, and set upon the ways of Holiness; <hi>Paul</hi> had been in his youth a Persecutor,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1 15</note> injurious, a Blasphemer, yet after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance what a foundation did hee lay of a good old age,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.10.</note> labouring more abundantly than others? he had been zealous to draw others to Hell, so now he was as forward to win others to Heaven; for <hi>Augustine,</hi> how vain, vilde, vicious, sinful was his youth, wallowing himself in all Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness, as his confessions speak? where how doth he bewail himself, &amp; yet after repentance, what an useful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument was he in the Church of Christ? many admire, and that deservedly, <hi>Chrysostoms</hi> golden Rollings, <hi>Cyprians</hi> Martyr-like spirit; running through all his Works; but we may behold these, nay more than these in <hi>Augustine</hi> after his repentance.</p>

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here in <hi>England,</hi> in the fourth year of her Reign; taking up their residence at <hi>Colchester,</hi> where he lived many years in very good esteem, and was very forward and industrious for the setting up, and promoting of the <hi>great Manufacture</hi> there for the Publick good, and God blessed him in the same, and in a hopeful Issue, untill he dyed in a good age at <hi>London.</hi> Now as both these <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi> had made <hi>Piety their greatest</hi> interest, and the <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Religion their best Purchase,</hi> so they were ever


<pb facs="tcp:57598:20"/>
exceeding <hi>sollicitous, and diligent to season their Children,</hi> and this their <hi>Son</hi> especially, from the very Cradle with the <hi>fear and nurture of the Lord,</hi> and that with such blessed success on him, that having Piety instilled into him by their means, and publick Ordinances, through Gods Grace, he never departed from it to his dying day, but proved most exemplary therein, through all the course and relations of his life; so that even in <hi>his younger years</hi> he never was given to, nor delighted with those vain and sinful Sports and Pastimes, to which youth is ordinarily so prone to, and so hard to be weaned from. His <hi>Recreation was commonly to turn from one honest or pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous employment unto another,</hi> as from that of his Calling, (being brought up timely to Trade and Merchandize and in which he was always very careful, and industrious) to the reading of the <hi>Bible,</hi> and other <hi>good Books,</hi> Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and learning of <hi>Languages,</hi> acquainting himself with several of the best <hi>Histories,</hi> especially such as treated of the <hi>Persecutions,</hi> and <hi>Deliverances</hi> of the Church of God, and the <hi>Propagation of the Gospel,</hi> all which he made in a manner his own, such delight he took both in the peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal, and rehearsal of the same on all occasions, and yet omitting no publick opportunities, whereby he might nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish communion with God at any time.</p>
            <p>He would often bless God, that according to his ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest prayers (when he came first up to <hi>London</hi>) hee had kept him from bad <hi>company,</hi> and from all allurements and engaging occasions of haunting Taverns, and the like places, whereby so many hopeful young men come to be undone. Being grown up to some greater <hi>maturity of years and Grace,</hi> and acquaintance with God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to <hi>Trade</hi> for himself, his singular <hi>care and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actness, industry, and discretion,</hi> was soon taken notice of, and he had more credit when he began, than divers that had lived in pretty good repute before him, every one was ready and even desirous to trust him, and deal with him; which great advantage he nevertheless used very sober<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, undertaking no more than he was well able to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage,


<pb facs="tcp:57598:20"/>
and minding what once he had undertaken with all the vigilancy and attendance such employments, and the duty of his Calling did require; and the blessing of God was evidently upon all his ways and affairs, yet so that as he was not hasty to be rich, <hi>he</hi> would often say, <hi>hee was not hastily rich.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By Gods good providence and direction, he was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards guided to <hi>Marry</hi> a party of like good and pious education, and disposition, and of a Stock likewise tried, and grown up under Persecution, Mistris <hi>Anne Tivelin,</hi> whose Parents had sheltered themselves at <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury</hi>: she was then the Widdow of Mr. <hi>David King</hi> Merchant, of whom she had Mr. <hi>Ezekias King,</hi> yet li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, the pious and learned Minister of <hi>Fulmore</hi> in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridgeshire</hi>; with this Consort Mr. <hi>Lamotte</hi> lived well and comfortably many years, and they had together several gracious Children, eight in all, whereof six, two Sons and four Daughters, dyed in their yonger years, and only two Daughters (most piously and vertuously educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted) lived to married estate; the elder <hi>Hester,</hi> being wedded first to <hi>John Manning</hi> 
               <abbr>Esq</abbr> an eminent Merchant of this City, by whom she had three Children, but none surviving him, and after his decease to Sir <hi>Thomas Honywood</hi> Knight, of <hi>Markshall</hi> in <hi>Essex,</hi> both living yet happily together, beloved and honoured of all that know them farre and near, together with their hopeful Issue, two Sons and one Daughter, the remainder of seven Children they have had together; the younger Daughter <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was married to that worthy Gentleman Master <hi>Maurice Abbot,</hi> (Son to Sir <hi>Maurice Abbot,</hi> once an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Alderman, and Lord Mayor of this City, and Brother to those two famous <hi>Abbots, George,</hi> sometimes Arch bishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and learned <hi>Robert,</hi> Bishop of <hi>Salisbury</hi>) and by him she had that hopeful Son and studious Gentleman Mr. <hi>Maurice Abbot,</hi> the present Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heir with his Aunt, besides three others dying young, as she also her self was not long enjoyed, and dyed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly bewailed for her singular parts, piety, and

            <p>The <hi>Love</hi> unto, and constant <hi>attendance</hi> upon the <hi>Word of God</hi> in publick and private, for the upholding and cherishing communion with God, by hearing and reading the Scriptures, and meditating therein, had so possest and filled his soul, that most of his discourses and Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters were most savourly seasoned with it, and he would often expresse a great deal of heart-grief and astonish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, at most mens heedlessenesse in duties so highly and neerly concerning their everlasting Welfare. And how re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al his piety and acquaintance with God was, appeared suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently, as by many other discoveries, so also by those streams of true Christian <hi>charity,</hi> which uncessantly issued from him and which made him not only willing and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to impart and communicate liberally in that kind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, but also to sollicite and stir up others perpetually, <hi>setting</hi> all (as it were) <hi>on fire of compassion,</hi> that came neer him, especially where and whensoever any publick cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity

            <p>And God having given him such <hi>largenesse of heart, and freenesse of hand,</hi> he gave also unto him <hi>understan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to manage all his affaires with order and discretion,</hi> that he knew both <hi>where and when to spare and to spend,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was enabled still to do the more good, finding and acknowledging alwaies both the temporal and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall returns and comforts of doing the same; and that made him alwaies as God blessed him <hi>to lay aside a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion for charitable uses,</hi> which he as carefully distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted afterward.</p>
            <p>But if God was pleased at any time to exercise him with <hi>losses or crosses</hi> of any kind, whereof he had his share too (among other of Gods Children) as well in his <hi>Trade and Estate</hi> now and then, by severall casualties by Sea and Land, at home and abroad, in his severall functions and relations, and especially in his <hi>body</hi> by diverse great <hi>infirmities</hi> and <hi>sicknesses,</hi> principally toward and in the latter part of his life, yet he alwaies shewed <hi>abundance of patience</hi> and <hi>quiet submission, to the ever-good hand and pleasure of his heavenly Father, and faithfull Redeemer,</hi> comforting himself very much with the examples of <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, Joseph, Job, David,</hi> and others of Gods Saints and ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,

in all ages, with whose histories he was exactly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted; praysing God still, that in respect of his <hi>outward man,</hi> he so long vouchsafed him the benefit of his <hi>sight and hearing</hi> in that comfortable measure, whereby he could partake still of his holy <hi>Ordinances,</hi> both in publick and private; and for his <hi>inner man,</hi> that in all his troubles and afflictions, <hi>God never long with-held his gracious and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly countenance from him, in Jesus Christ,</hi> wherein he found comfort sufficient to allay all his grief, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent all murmuring in his troubles; he did not much vent himself by discourses, but retired himself<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and unbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>somed his heart, and spread his condition before the Lord in prayer. When but three weeks before his decease, he was sore afflicted with extremity of head-ake and Colick, that he began to find some impatience to seize on him, he soon recollected and chekt himself, saying, <hi>How often and fervently have I besought the Lord, that he would be pleased to fit and prepare mee for himself,</hi> and his <hi>everlasting Kingdome, and why then should I find fault and repine, now when he thus really and effectually doth prepare me, making mee by these very pains and torments, loathe this wretched World so much the more, and long for my hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py change, and dissolution, and to be with my Redeemer</hi>; and thus he continued for the most part, even to his <hi>last hour,</hi> which was <hi>July</hi> 13. 1655. in the seventy ninth year of his age; <hi>looking death cheerfully in the face,</hi> as of whom he was <hi>not afraid,</hi> being implanted into Christ, and thereby freed from the imbondaging fear of death, alwaies almost speaking of the same, and setting the remembrance of our latter end, both before himself, and others, upon all oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions, knowing there was no such effectuall means to make us apply our hearts to <hi>wisdome,</hi> that is to say, to the <hi>fear of God,</hi> the only Antidote against all other fear.</p>
            <p>And as in <hi>Troubles and Affliction</hi> hee shewed a great deal of <hi>filial submission and resignation to God,</hi> so it was a comfort to all that conversed with him to see and observe his continuall <hi>thankfull remembrances</hi> of and <hi>chearfull re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing</hi> in <hi>Gods mercies and goodnesse,</hi> both to the <hi>Church</hi>

in generall and particular, and to the Land and <hi>Nation</hi> wherein he lived; as also to any of his dear <hi>friends and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi>; as well as to his own <hi>person,</hi> loving both to hear and speak much of that Argument, and ever and anon most feelingly exclaiming, <hi>O what cause have wee to praise our good and mercifull God, that</hi> yet <hi>preserveth,</hi> yet <hi>affecteth,</hi> yet <hi>delivers</hi> and <hi>favours us, and passeth by, and forgiveth our manifold infirmities, transgressions and provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations aggravated with so much unthankfullness, if yet we would love him and beleeve in him,</hi> and yet <hi>walk</hi> in his fear obediently before <hi>him,</hi> to our <hi>everlasting happinesse.</hi> On Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> anniversarie Coronation day, he would usually bid some friends, and put them in mind of the great <hi>Mercy of God</hi> shewed to <hi>England</hi> on that day, by <hi>quenching the fires in</hi> Smith field, and continuing the <hi>Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi> ever since, for so many years among us, even <hi>beyond the number of years recorded in Scripture, of an uninterrupted prosperous estate of the Church</hi>; and then, as also on his <hi>Birth-day,</hi> and other joyfull occasions of friends, meeting at his house he would often say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he had desired their company, <hi>to eat bread with him before the Lord</hi> (as <hi>Jethro</hi> and <hi>Moses</hi> did) in remembrance of such and such signal <hi>Mercies</hi> and <hi>Deliverances,</hi> whereof <hi>his memory was a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Chronicle,</hi> especially of those grand Deliverances, both before and since the <hi>Reformation,</hi> from under the great sufferings and bloody <hi>Persecutions in</hi> France, <hi>and the low-Countries,</hi> whereof he would often discourse in so punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all and feeling a manner, as if he had been an eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, yea a sharer in them, taking many arguments thence of encouraging both himself and others, to be still <hi>mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of them in bonds and miseries, as being themselves in the body</hi>; saying, why, <hi>their case might have been ours, or may be yet, who knows</hi>?</p>
            <p>And instancing often in this particular with holy ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and thankfullnesse, that when his own <hi>Father</hi> (for Religion sake being fain to flee for his life) stood doubtfull, whether, like as many others did, he should re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair for <hi>shelter</hi> to the <hi>Palatinate</hi> and <hi>Frankendale,</hi> or to

               <hi>England,</hi> that yet God inclined his heart to chuse <hi>England</hi> for his place of refuge, whereupon he would frequently inferre, hee had great cause, especially since their late sad condition in that place and Country (in acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that <hi>preserving mercie</hi>) to have a <hi>fellow feeling</hi> of their Miseries, wherein himself and his might have been <hi>involved together</hi> with them, since God had not only kept and safeguarded him and his from the same, but likewise abundantly blessed and protected him and them hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And therefore he was very mindfull to send relief to many of them from time to time.</p>
            <p>Together with all these <hi>eminent graces,</hi> God had likewise endued him with a large portion of <hi>Wisdome, Judgement, and Understanding,</hi> in many things of moment and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, grounded on much <hi>experience, observation and practise</hi> of his own, for which he was deservedly much esteemed by men of no small place and account. <hi>Hee brought still forth out of his Treasure old and new,</hi> and knew so pertinently to produce, compare and apply the same, that it was great pleasure and no lesse profit and instruction to hear him.</p>
            <p>The <hi>pious and indefatigable care and pains hee took in bringing up of his Children, and governing his family, in the fear and admonition of the Lord,</hi> is hinted partly alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. <hi>His perpetual indeavour</hi> was to bring them into ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance and communion with God, and to make them stand in <hi>filial awe and fear of him,</hi> to read and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditate, and take delight in the <hi>Word of God, to be well groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and setled in Religion, and not shaken by every wind of Doctrin</hi>; to avoid and <hi>flee all vain and idle courses, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and dalliances</hi>; to be <hi>painfull, carefull and diligent,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one in his peculiar <hi>calling and imployment, orderly and exact</hi> in all their <hi>affaires, sober and frugal</hi> in the use of Gods good creatures, full of <hi>bowels of compassion</hi> to the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted and distressed Members of Christ, and to all that were in need, and chearfully <hi>ready to communicate</hi> unto such; <hi>loving and helpfull one to another, obedient</hi> to all good <hi>orders, submissive to the Magistrate, respectfull to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistry,
