         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>8 This Glorious <hi>High-Prieſthood of the Son of God,</hi> then,

Manner; ſo that Text ſeemes to imply, <hi>[And he was THE
PRIEST of the Moſt High God.]</hi> 2. That <hi>Aaron,</hi> who
was alſo a Type of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> did not take this Honour upon himſelf,

Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> The Son, The Only Son of God, (and ſo by natural
Inheritance intituled to the Kingdom and Prieſthood of the world)

word of the Oath of God. Hebr.</hi> 7. 20. &amp;c. Doth render
me wonder-ſtrook at four ſorts of men moſt Active in this Buſie
Age. 1. At ſuch as think it a Piece of their Christianitie to loath and
and deſpight the Name of <hi>Prieſt,</hi> as of ſome pernicious vermin bred
out of a Putrid Jewiſh Carkaſs; whereas it Signifies neither leſs
nor more then a Perſon intrusted (and who is ſufficient for that
Thing!) with ſome part or Branch of Chriſts Prieſthood which
is here on earth to be managed and Executed for the Benefit of
mankinde, even of Him that ſo Hates the name. 2. That the
<hi>Biſhop of that Antient Sea Apoſtolick</hi> ſhould by vertue of ſuch
a dimme <hi>Commiſſion</hi> as cannot be read without Spectacles of
Phanſie made at Rome, <hi>Graſp at All</hi> in groſs, as if all Power, which
<hi>Chriſt Himſelf</hi> doth not perſonally exerciſe in the Heavenly Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arie,
was to paſs and be derived by impoſition or under the Signature
of His Hand, and to be ſhared and diſpenſed at his diſcretion.
3. That thoſe our Brethren in Chriſt (if yet they will allow us
to call them Brethren which have welnigh given over to ſay <hi>Pater
<pb facs="tcp:100044:5"/>
Noſter)</hi> who ſo zealouſly hate Innovations, ſhould, contrarie to the
Church-Practice of 15. Ages together, not only 1. take upon them to
<hi>Ordain</hi> or commiſſionate men to execute part of <hi>Chriſts Preiſthood,</hi>
and 2. to <hi>Cenſure</hi> offenders, without conſent of <hi>that Order</hi> which
hath ſo fair a <hi>Patent</hi> to ſhew, and ſo long <hi>Preſcription,</hi> ſomewhile
for the <hi>ſole Power,</hi> alwayes for the <hi>Main Stroke</hi> in Both; But
even 3. to cenſure and excommunicate ſome Perſons of that <hi>Order,</hi>
and 4. the very <hi>Order</hi> it ſelf (in ſubmiſſion to which (when time
was) they ſeemed to us, to live with a good conſcience, and in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
Communion with their conforming Brethren) which hath
in effect proved, the cutting off that Goodly Bough whereof them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
were Branches: not conſidering, either how ill themſelves
take it, when any thing by others is affirmed that contains in it but
a Conſequence which will condemn the Practiſe of the Reformed
Churches of theſe two laſt Centuries; or How ill a Phyſiognomie the
very outward Face of the Act caries, as of a Strife (managed even
unto Blood) for <hi>Cheif Roomes in Synagogues, who ſhould be
the greateſt,</hi> or have the Greateſt ſhare in Exerciſing ſuch parts of
Chriſts Prieſthood as be concredited to men; A thing flat contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
to the Precepts of Chriſt, and to the humilitie of a Chriſtian,
whoſe only ſtrife is, to preferre others in Honour before Himſelf,
&amp; whoſe onely Ambition is, to become like one of thoſe little ones that
are weaned from the Breaſt. 4. That the volunteeres of the People,
who have improved the former Tranſgreſſion of removing the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
Church-Marks which our fathers had ſet, (rather the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
themſelves ſet for Land-marks and Guides) to a total Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition;
caſting off the ſons who had caſt out their Fathers, and the
Branches which had pluckt up their own Roots, and ſo ſucceeding
both as Augmenters and Revengers of the ſin: eſpecially that any which
among them pretend to the Fear of God and Love our <hi>Great High-Prieſt,</hi>
ſhould not ſcruple at all, to execrate all conſecration of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
to ſerve in Chriſt's ſtead, and yet Dubb themſelves officers;
when as, God knowes, they be as far from Abilities to diſcharge as
<pb facs="tcp:100044:5"/>
they are from Authoritie to undertake the duty. The Catechizing
of their own children and ſervants in their own private Families, and
whetting upon them the Confeſſed Duties of Chriſtianitie, Humblneſs
of mind, Meekneſs of Spirit, Puritie of Heart &amp;c. Being a task
large enough for Better Qualifications then the common ſort of men,
generally Have. He that ſearches the hearts knows, This is not
ſpoken out of envie at the <hi>people</hi> of God. I could wiſh, all of them
were Prophets, and my ſelf the moſt ignorant man in the world; (not
that I would know leſs then I do, but have all others know more then
my ſelf.) The ſence of my deep unworthineſs, to be numbred among
thoſe that have obtained a leſse &amp; lower part in the Miniſtery, works
a remorſe for entring (though by the right Door, yet,) ſo praepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perè
into it: and expreſſes from me this profeſſion, That if it were now
to do, I ſhould, haply, as <hi>Thales</hi> did in another caſe, either find my
ſelf too young a novice, or too old a Doater, to put my ſhoulders under ſo
formidable (though honourable) a weight of truſt and care.</p>
            <p>10. When I have beſought three of thoſe ſorts concerned in theſe
particulars, with all the Humilitie and meekneſs their charitie can im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agin
in a Diſſenting Brother, and by the Bowels of mercy in our moſt
Compaſſionate High-prieſt, <hi>Redire ad Cor,</hi> to take theſe things into
ſerious thoughts, without prejudging their Conſcience by and ſiniſter
conſiderations: and when I have made ſupplication to the Almighty,
who Commanded light to ſhine out Darkneſs, That A Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union
of hearts and minds may be the only Revenge and ſpeedy Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
of all our Differings; I ſhall proceed to another obſervation,
and'tis This.</p>
            <p>That the eternal God ſhould fix ſuch a <hi>Notable Seal</hi> upon <hi>Chriſts
Prieſthood</hi> as His <hi>Oath</hi> is; That Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould be ſo Copious
and Demonſtrative in the Argument as he is, And yet that there
ſhould be ſo little notice taken of it by our Divines. I must profeſs both
mine own ignorance in the Point, and mine unacquaintedneſs with our
Engliſh writers to be ſuch, that were I, at the writing hereof, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
within a Circle till I had given in mine Anſwer to this Question,
<pb facs="tcp:100044:6"/>
               <hi>[What Engliſh Divine had firſt writt about Chriſt's Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood?]</hi>
I must,<note place="margin">See his 9. Book Printed 1638.</note> to my knowledge, ſay, <hi>This Authour.</hi>
From his former Book I had the first, and from <hi>This</hi> a
more full diſcovery of the Excellent Mysteries and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts
conteined in it.</p>
            <p>11. And though the wonder be the greater, that, there ſhould be
ſuch a Vacuitie or ſilence (about this High Buſineſs) among thoſe
whoſe every third word, in their popular Diſcourſes, is, <hi>The Lord
Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> who ſo profeſs the <hi>Knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> as if (the
Monopolie was ingroſſed in their Breſts) it was to dye with them
unleſs learned from them: Yet will it be much the leſs wonderfull,
when it ſhall be conſidered; That ſome of the Doctrines of later times,
(Viz. <hi>That the Iſſues of life and death Everlaſting are ſo
paſt, decreed, and ſealed from Eternitie, that no man ever
had any poſſibilitie to attain the Point oppoſite to that whereat
he actually doth arrive. That ſome mens ſinnes be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
not only before they be repented of, but before they be
Committed. &amp;c.)</hi> Do by certain, though perhaps unwitting
Conſequences, Render Christ's Prieſthood uſeleſs and ſuperfluous.

to procure that which cannot but be? o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

<hi>Inſtrumentalitie</hi> may have place, <hi>Officiation</hi> can have none.</p>
            <p>12. But ſuppoſing (what I wiſh) Every Reader as well, or
better affected to, and more intelligent of the benefits of <hi>Chriſts prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
then the prefacer is, or the Authour himſelf was; Yet is this
no ſecuritie, but Fault wilbe found with the Authour, for leading the
Reader through a wearie Wilderneſs, rather then <hi>(per viam Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendij)</hi>
by the neareſt avenue of Approach to the Throne of <hi>Our
Moſt Gratious High-prieſt;</hi> by the long and Thornie wayes of
Queſtions about <hi>Adam's Firſt Eſtate, His Actual, our Original,
Actual, and Habitual Sin, and Servitude thereto; about the

&amp;c.</hi> Let me pray ſuch an One to Conſider, That it was as impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

for the Authour fruitfully to diſplay the Benefits of <hi>Chriſts Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,</hi>
before he had treated of <hi>Thoſe Particulars,</hi> as it is for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

Taint, or Peſtilential ulcer of ſin Original (which more or leſs is upon
the Body, or in the fleſh of every mothers ſon, the pureſt Saint on Earth
not excepted) will ſue to Chriſt for Cleanſing there-from. And yet is
the daily waſhing of his feet. (<note n="†" place="margin">Pes, <gap reason="foreign">

Circumſpectly upon the face of the Earth, as is his daily

beſt Commend The precious benefits, (Bleſſing and waſhing &amp;c.) to be
received at <hi>His</hi> hands.</p>
            <p>13. Well worth the labour, then, of this Great Authour it was, to
ſpend the <hi>Five Firſt Sections</hi> in handling thoſe particulars, with pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
to make them a <hi>Fair Introduction</hi> to the Main Point, <hi>The
Prieſthood of Chriſt.</hi> And not to Diſſemble with the Reader, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
He intended no more then <hi>Thoſe Five</hi> for the Ingredients or
Conſiſtencie of the Tenth Book. Purpoſing to ſubjoyn, all, or moſt of thoſe
pieces which make up the Sixt Section (which be a companie of Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
and Choice Tracts) as an Appendix to, not as members of the
Book. And I had once thought to have Complyed with mine own ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion
of this intended Method, and put them in ſome place of
neutralitie betwixt the Books; But when, upon Conſideration, I found
that this Diſpoſal would prove confuſive &amp; inconvenient to the reader,
at leaſt, to him that had not a more Methodical Head then my ſelf,
I reſolved to place them as they now ſtand. And truely they fall in
ſo orderly, and ſo Decently indent with the precedent and following
Sections, that I repent me of nothing ſo much, in this work, as of ſome
marginal notes (which by theſe preſents I revoke) inſperſed here and
there by me, Timorous, (becauſe I had the Copie dropping and by
Piece-meal) that the parts would not Symmetrize ſo well as I hope
they will be found to Do.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100044:7"/>
14. And this I think was agreeable (in the General) to the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thours
mind; who, if he had made only the five firſt Sections, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutives
of the 10. Book, and put what concernes <hi>The Prieſthood</hi> in
the 11. or elſwhere, would probably have put them forth together; he
having expreſſed himſelf <hi>to think it A Decorum that the Plaſter
ſhould go along with the ſore. And the rather ſo, becauſe he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi>
(and he hath been adaequate to his promiſe) <hi>to lance that feſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
wound (or Complication of wounds) of Human Nature,
deeper then moſt others had done, which had treated, before him,
of Sin Original, and Mans Servitude to Sin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>15. This Preface wilbe grown aboue the juſt ſtature of a Preface,
when I ſhall have told the Reader theſe 4. Particulars. 1. That of the
Tracts now publiſhed, divers were written 15; others, 30. &amp; more years
ago. This will both give a reaſon why in ſome of them The old Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is uſed; &amp; ſecure ſome paſſages at which otherwiſe offence might be
taken; which he that ſhall now do (after he is told thus much) will Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
the Author by Falting him, &amp; enhance his words into the notion
of propheſie. 2. That the reaſon why the Authours 4. 5. 6. &amp;c. Books
were not printed in Sequence, is, becauſe the owner of the Copies may
not as yet, without great damage, either conſent that another man ſhould,
or afford to do it Himſelf. So that we were inforced to fall upon this
Tenth; which may be more acceptable to the Reader, by being new,
and no leſs beneficial, ſeeing He may ſerve himſelf of the Quarto ones,
which, in the Interim, are parable. 3. And when God ſhall give op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunitie
to print the Quarto's in this Volume, we muſt tell the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
before hand, that the ſixt Book, <hi>of Divine Eſſence Attributes &amp;
Providence,</hi> will not adminiſter to him either the delight or the profit
we intended, unleſs God move the hearts of them that have the MS. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pie
of the <hi>Treatiſe of Prodigies, or, Divine Forewarnings betoken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Blood:</hi> (which certainly was perfected by the Authour, &amp; lent or
loſt in his life time) to produce it, that it may be annexed to the ſixt
Book, to which of due it appertaines. The 4. Particular will give the
Reader notice what Subject Matters he is to expect handled in the 11.
Book. But before we name them, he muſt be reminded, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour
<pb facs="tcp:100044:7"/>
had in the 9. Book, come as farre as the <hi>Article of Chriſts A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion</hi>
(reckoning Incluſivé:) &amp; in the 39. Chapter of that Book,
had tackt <hi>That Article</hi> to the next of <hi>His Seſſion</hi> at the Right-Hand
of God. Now the reſpective <hi>Ends or Effects</hi> of <hi>Chriſts Aſcenſion
into heaven,</hi> and of <hi>His Seſſion at the Right-Hand of Majeſtie,
were</hi> ſome of them of <hi>Immediate</hi> (and if I may ſo ſay, of a <hi>Tranſient)
diſpatch:</hi> And ſuch, I take it, <hi>were, His</hi> prepareing a place for his
Elect Ones; <hi>His</hi> Conſecrating the heavenly Sanctuarie, and ſetting open
the Kingdom of Heaven to all Believers, <hi>His</hi> ſending the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi>
in the Grace of comfort, &amp; Gifts of tongues, &amp;c. Some are of conſtant
Vſe, and continue in <hi>Eſſe</hi> unto this day, &amp; ſo ſhall unto the worlds end;
as the <hi>Providential Government of His Church,</hi> and the reſt of the
world in order to the affaires of his Church, which He adminiſters as
<hi>Lord;</hi> &amp; the Exerciſe of His <hi>Sacerdotal Office</hi> which he executes
as <hi>Chriſt:</hi> &amp; ſome <hi>ſhall be</hi> manifeſted at the end of time &amp; of this
ſinfull world, when He ſhall come in great power and Glory to Judge
both quick &amp; dead. What this Authour hath ſaid upon any of theſe
Heads, in his Books already printed, the Reader, if he will take the
paines to ſearch, may find. Of the following Generals (with their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident
&amp; ſubordinate particulars) doth the Eleventh Book treat. Of
<hi>Chriſts Seſſion</hi> at the Right-Hand of God; the <hi>Grammatical Senſe</hi>
of the words, &amp; the <hi>Real Dignitie</hi> anſwering to them, viz. <hi>The Exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of Chriſt.</hi> And whether He was exalted as the <hi>Son of God,</hi> or,
as the <hi>Son of David.</hi> An excellent ſtate of the queſtion about <hi>Ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie.</hi>
Of <hi>Chriſts Lordſhip</hi> or Dominion. Of His
<hi>Coming to Judgement.</hi> Of the <hi>Final Sentence</hi> to be
awarded by Him to All. Of the <hi>Reſurrection of the
Dead.</hi>
               <note place="margin">From thence He ſhall come to Judge the quick and the Dead.</note> 
               <hi>Of Life Everlaſting</hi> (not the merit of man,
but) the Gift of God; and <hi>Death</hi> the wages of ſin. So
that it is plain the Eleventh Book reflects upon,<note place="margin">—The Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Body, and Life Everlaſting.</note> or reſumes,
the <hi>Article of Chriſts Sitting at the Right-Hand of
God,</hi> and withall proceeds to the Next, and to the
Two laſt.</p>
            <p>16. I Expect, the Intelligent Reader will Ask, where He may find
<pb facs="tcp:100044:8"/>
handld, the <hi>Articles</hi> concerning <hi>God the Holie Spirit;</hi> the <hi>holy Cath<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>olick Church,</hi> the <hi>Communion of Saints; &amp; the Forgiveneſs of
Sins?</hi> I muſt referr the propoſer of this rational queſtion (which deſerves
a better anſwer then I can give it) to the Authors owne words,
[Which he may find in the firſt page of His Treatiſe Of <hi>The Holy Catholick Faith and
Church,</hi> which in the Catalogues of his Works, for orders ſake, is reckon'd the 12. Book of his
Commentaries, and whereof the firſt part of three intended, was publiſhed. 1627. In my Comments on the

to ſignifie their Retainance, or, to which of the 12.
Chriſtian Predicaments they are to be reduced.</p>
            <p>17. I have yet <hi>Two things</hi> to recommend unto the Reader. <hi>The
One</hi> I humbly preſent to the Conſideration of the Nobilitie &amp; Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trie
of the Land, who have the Honour &amp; Bleſſing—<hi>Longo San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine
Cenſeri—.</hi> This Author (as his manner all-a-long is, to open
the Earth, &amp; ſhew the Out-Burſt of the ſpring, &amp; leave the <hi>Well</hi> to
be digged by him that meanes to dwell upon the Plat) hath, page 19.
&amp; 31. moved a <hi>Querie</hi> well worth their moſt exquiſite indagation
and purſuit. <q>'Tis This: whether Parents (of both ſexes) may not,
by frequent voluntarie Commiſſion of ſome ſinnes, improve the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption
of nature in their Children, to an Height above the ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie
Taint deſcending from Adam, or coming from Sin meerely Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,
&amp; not intended by unneceſſary affected actual or habitual
Tranſgreſſing?</q> Would any of Them, now in this their privacie or
vacation, pleaſe, <hi>Philoſophari,</hi> to think upon it, and Commend their
meditations to the world; they would be more acceptable and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perative
of practiſe, Coming from themſelves, &amp; conſequently be more
Contributive to the Revival of virtue unto an Heroical Degree.</p>
            <p>18. The other is to thoſe of the Clergie who teach the people Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
&amp; for that end do ſeek acceptable words out of writings upright
<pb facs="tcp:100044:8"/>
and True; (as for the pretended Favorites of the Spirit, it is in vain
to ſpeak to them.) He that has Compaſſion on the poor ignorant multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
(even deſtroyed for lack of Knowledge of Principles contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in their Creed, Catechiſm &amp;c.) And a mind to tread in the Good
Old way for Aedification of the poor of the Flock, may find in this
Authors Works, matter, proper for every <hi>Dominical &amp; Feſtival</hi>
through the year, eſpecially for the ſpecial ones, that is, thoſe that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate
<hi>the Great Benefits received by Chriſt.</hi> As alſo for oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions
of Adminiſtring <hi>Both Sacraments, marriages, Funerals,
Faſts &amp;c.</hi> But let me tell him, The Gold (he is to find &amp; beat out)
doth ſomtimes lie in ſo ſmal a Compaſs, that unleſs he obſerve well, he
may over-run it. For an Experiment, he may ſee 1 grain taken by me &amp;
beaten out into divers Leaves. And for expounding Texts of Scripture,
this Author ſeems to have a felicitie not ordinary. Oft-times, when
he pretends but to take One verſe, he illuminates the Reader in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picycle
of the Context, nay in the next <hi>Orbe,</hi> I mean the <hi>Parallel,</hi>
be it in the old or new Teſtament. But the <hi>Magiſterium</hi> of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencie
is in <hi>Chriſtologie,</hi> in the diſplay of the Myſteries of Chriſt,
which he never thinks done, till he have layd the Type and ſhadow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the ſubſtance, and the Propheſie (as the Prophet did his Body) up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Event, Face to Face, Hand to Hand, Part to Part &amp;c. And
his powerfulneſs in <hi>This</hi> hath gotten him ſo deſerved eſteem amongſt
divers Learned men (though of different Judgment in ſome points)
that in their works they have quoted him as <hi>An Author.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19. What unworthy paines my ſelf have taken about the work, in
the ſpace of 6. or 7. Months, may be ſumm'd up in two lines. The
falts of the <hi>Preſſe</hi> be few &amp; ſmal, yet I am not only to be blamed for
them, not undertaking more then to aſſiſt. Any Error in the notes,
marginal or final, is to be imputed to my weakneſs. For the Authors
Text, I have not in the leaſt degree alter'd, intended, or remitted his
ſenſe, in any one Aſſertion, or point of Doctrine. But, which is the
Dutie of an <hi>Editour,</hi> have been Scrupulouſly Carefull to deliver his
Work as he left it &amp; meant it, not attending to gratify either mine
own or the Readers opinions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:100044:9"/>
20. What Fate abides (either my ſelf, or) this Orphan-Book, is
only known to God. It is, of this Authors Works, for number, the <hi>Tenth,</hi>
for bulk, larger then the moſt, for learning, Equal, &amp; for Excellencie
of ſubject matter, ſuperior to any of the other Nine: (for it is, Of the
Knowledge of our ſelves Servants to ſin: And of the Son of God, by
the exerciſe of His Everlaſting Prieſthood, making us Free from ſin.)
And ſo in juſt Decorum, as it affords Royal Dainties, ſo it deſerves
the Choiceſt Patronage that any of his fellows had, even of ſuch as
have Right to Receive Tithes: yet ſeeing it ſo fals out, by the ever to
be Adored &amp; admired providence of God, that ſuch it may not have
now; It comes forth under the more Immediate Patronage of the
Almightie, God the Father, the Word, &amp; the Holie Spirit. Eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally

more Improvable in Buſineſſes Sacred, eſpecially in ſuch as have been
heretofore handled in part, and come now to be further diſcuſs'd. The Firſt
Part of the KNOWLEDGE of JESUS CHRIST and of Him Crucified, Raiſed
from the Dead, &amp;c. is a great deal more eaſily learned, then the Second,
unto which theſe preſent Meditations are addreſt. The Firſt Part of this
Heavenly <hi>Knowledge</hi> conſiſts principally in the diſplay of the <hi>Harmony</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the Prophetical, and Evangelical Writings, or the Parallels between
Matters of <hi>Fact</hi> recorded in the Old Teſtament, and the <hi>Events</hi> anſwering
in Proportion to them in the New, already exhibited, and further to be
accompliſhed before the end of this World, or in the World to come.</p>
            <p>2. The Second Part of the KNOWLEDGE of CHRIST conſiſts in the
true Eſtimate or Experimental Valuation of his Death and Sufferings, of his
<pb n="3002" facs="tcp:100044:14"/>
Reſurrection from the Dead, and Exerciſe of his Everlaſting Sacerdotal
Function. To this later part of the Knowledge of Chriſt and him Crucified,

doth anſwer in a true kind of ſubproportion. Unto this Second Part of the
Knowledge of Chriſt, ſomewhat more is required then hath been expreſſed
in the Former Part; betwixt which and thoſe Scientifical Concluſions in
Sciences which we call <hi>à Priori,</hi> there is perfect <hi>Analogie</hi> or Correſponden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy;

true or perfect knowledge of God, whether as He is our Creator, our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
or our Sanctifier. And this true knowledge of our ſelves hath a
double Aſpect, the one unto the <hi>Eſtate from which,</hi> the other unto the
Eſtate into which we are fallen. The chief, if not the only Reaſon, Why
the God-head or Eternal Son-ſhip of Chriſt Jeſus, is, in this laſt Age, que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtioned;
Why his Meritorious Satisfaction for the Sins of the World, is by
ſome flatly denied, is, Becauſe the Parties this way peccant, or ſuch as can
with Chriſtian patience or without diſguſt, read or hear their Diſcourſes,
do not know themſelves either in the <hi>Individual,</hi> as they are Mortal Men and
tainted with many Actual Sins, or in the <hi>General,</hi> as they are the Sons of
<hi>Adam.</hi> They underſtand not the Prerogatives that Man had in his firſt
Creation above other Creatures; nor yet trouble their thoughts, How that
which They and We call <hi>Sin,</hi> found firſt Entrance into the World; How
it hath been propagated throughout all Mankind; or what be the ſpecial
Properties, the true Effects, or Power of it. Now without the Knowledge
or ſerious Conſideration of all theſe Points, it is impoſſible for Us, for any
Man, to take a true, much leſſe a full or competent Eſtimate of Chriſts Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
upon the Croſſe; or of the Efficacy of his Reſurrection from the
Dead; of the Fruits of the Spirit, which he promiſed to all his Followers,

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Bout the Prerogatives or Praeeminences of the Firſt Man,
over and above all others, which by Natural Deſcent
have ſprung from him, a great variety of Opinions there
is; more then is about the Limitation or Extent of the
Prerogative Royal in moſt Kingdoms Chriſtian, as now
they ſtand. But the ſeveral Opinions contained within
this great and ſpacious variety, concerning the Eſtate or
Prerogatives of the Firſt Man, are (in my opinion) very compatible: Few
or none of them contradict others. And it is the Part of Divines by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,
not to ſow any ſeeds of contention between the Authors or Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of ſeveral Opinions, which in their nature imply no Contradiction. Yea
in times Ancient and unpartial, it hath been accounted one ſpecial part of
Prieſts or Profeſt Divines, to ſolicite or Mediate for Compromiſe between
Parties at difference, whether in Matters Civil or Criminally Capital; much
more to Endeavour for Reconciliation of Opinions or Controverſies proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
belonging to their own profeſſion.</p>
                  <p>2. Now it is confeſſed by all good Chriſtians, that the Firſt man was
made, in, or according to, the Image of God, which made him. But
wherein this <hi>Image of God,</hi> or the Live Copy of it exhibited in the Firſt Man,
did properly or chiefly conſiſt, is a Probleme wherein Many good Writers.
both Ancient and Modern, do ſowmewhat Vary. Some would have the
Prerogatives, which did reſult from the likeneſſe of God imprinted upon
the Firſt Man, to conſiſt principally in that <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>Dominion</hi> which He
had over all other viſible or ſublunary Creatures. But though it be true of
theſe preſent times as it was of former, That <hi>Dominium non fundatur in Fide,
id eſt,</hi> Kings and Supream Governours have their Right of Dominion over
their Subjects or Inferiors, albeit ſuch Kings and Governours, have not
at any time been true Chriſtians, or have degenerated from ſuch Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Faith as they have ſometimes profeſſed or maintained: yet without all
controverſie, that Soveraignty or Dominion, which the Firſt Man had over
all other viſible Creatures, was founded upon that Integrity of ſoul, or Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe
inherent, which He loſt. Since the Firſt Man and his Succeſſors,
became Corrupt in all their wayes; that Primaeval Dominion which the Firſt
Man had, did ceaſe by Degrees to be ſo entire, as once it was: Nor is there
any Hope to have it fully reſtored unto any Soveraignty, or prvate Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
<pb n="3004" facs="tcp:100044:15"/>
of any Soveraignty or Kingdom in this Life. Nor are all they, which
well agree in this General <hi>[That the Firſt Mans Similitude with his Maker,
did radically and punctually conſiſt in Righteouſneſs and Integrity of Soul and
Body]</hi> at ſo fair accord among themſelves, Wherein this Righteouſneſſe or
Integrity did properly or formally conſiſt; or of what Rank or Order
it was.</p>

                  <p>1.<note place="margin">Original righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe no ſupernatural Grace.</note> MAny Great Divines or Doctors heretofore have been, and ſome, or
rather Many, to this day, there be, who peremptorily determine,
and would perſwade Others, either by their Authority, or by Reaſon, to
believe; That the Righteouſneſſe of the Firſt Man did formally conſiſt in a
peculiar <hi>Grace, Supernatural,</hi> even to Him. If this Opinion were true, the
ſame Grace ſhould have been more then Supernatural to his ſucceſſors; ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
that they continued by natural propagation, in the ſame State and
Condition wherein the Firſt Man was Created. To maintain this opinion;
That the Righteouſneſſe or Integrity of the Firſt Man did conſiſt in a <hi>ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
Grace,</hi> the Romiſh Church (ſpecially ſince the publiſhing of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons
of the Trent Councel) is deeply engaged. For unleſſe this <hi>Poſtulatum</hi>
or Suppoſition be granted; Many Dogmatical Reſolutions which the whole
Chriſtian World, is, by the Romiſh Church, bound to believe <hi>ſub poenae
Anathematis,</hi> that is, under penalty of that Churches ſolemn Curſe or ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Damnation, cannot poſſibly, or with any Mediocrity of Probability
be maintained. The Points of Belief which from this <hi>Poſtulatum</hi> or ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
<hi>[That the Righteouſneſs wherein the Firſt Man was Created, was a Grace
Supernatural]</hi> might with ſome probability be maintained, are principally
theſe.</p>
                  <p>2. Firſt, That, <hi>Sin,</hi> which we and the Romiſh Church call <hi>Original,</hi>
ſhould be no more then a meer <hi>Privation</hi> of Original Juſtice,<note place="margin">Of the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies which will follow upon the affirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Opinion.</note> that is, of that
Image of God wherein the Firſt Man was Created. But the Ingenuous Reader
wil perhaps demand, what further Inconvenience wil follow upon the yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
or granting of the former <hi>Poſtulatum</hi> or Suppoſition unto them? This in
the Second place; That <hi>Adams</hi> Succeſſors whether immediate or interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
unto the worlds End ſhould have a greater meaſure of that which they
call <hi>Liberum Arbitrium</hi> or Free-will, then the word of God doth acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge;
or any Ingenuous Man, that will ſubjugate his Reaſon to be Regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by the written word, or Ancient Rules or Canons of Faith, can allow
or approve. This deduction following is clear by Rules of Reaſon, <hi>viz.</hi>
[<q>If the Righteouſneſſe of the Firſt Man did conſiſt in a <hi>Grace Supernatural,</hi>
or in any quality additional to his conſtitution, as he was the Work of God:
This Grace or Quality might have been, or rather, was loſt, without any
Real wound unto our Nature; Or without any other Wound, then ſuch
as the <hi>Free-will,</hi> or right uſe of Reaſon, or other Natural parts (which after
the loſſe this of ſuppoſed <hi>Supernatural Grace</hi> or Quality were left) might
inſtantly have cured, or yet may cure.]</q> Or in other terms (more Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtical
perhaps) Thus: <q>If the Integrity or Righteouſneſſe of the Firſt
Man, were loſt, only, <hi>demeritoriè,</hi> by way of Demerit, without any
phyſical or working cauſe of its expulſion, or without any wound made
<pb n="3005" facs="tcp:100044:15"/>
in our nature, by ſuch poſitive cauſe: The ſame Righteouſneſſe which the
Firſt Man had, might have been regained by the right uſe of Reaſon which
was left unto him, or of thoſe natural faculties which he had <hi>pro primâ
vice</hi> abuſed.</q> From theſe premiſſes the neceſſary conſequence will be
this; That the ſatisfaction of our Lord Chriſt, for ſin (original at leaſt) had
been ſuperfluous. And according to this <hi>Tenet,</hi> the Opinion of the Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans
would be more tolerable, and more juſtifiable, then the Doctrine of
the Romiſh Church, ſo far as it concerns the Valew or Efficacy of Chriſts
Sufferings, or Satisfaction by his Merits, or Juſtification by works, rather
then by faith, eſpecially works of the Moral Law, or obſervance of thoſe
two great Commandments, <hi>To love God above all; and, our Neighbours as our
Selves:</hi> or of that other, <hi>whatſoever you would that men ſhould do unto you,
even ſo do unto them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Laſtly, if all or any of theſe Opinions were granted, to the Church
of <hi>Rome:</hi> we of Reformed Churches ſhould be concluded to yield; That
<hi>Adams</hi> poſterity, or as many of them as are, or ſhall be, juſtified, were to
be <hi>Formally</hi> juſtified by inherent Righteouſneſſe; that is, they have, or
might challenge, abſolution, from the firſt ſentence denounced againſt
<hi>Adam,</hi> by way of legal plea or ſatisfaction. The deduction or <hi>remonſtration</hi>
of this demonſtrative inference, is clear to any Artiſt, to any reaſonable
man, unleſſe his Reaſon be overgrown by faction, or by mingling of paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
with his underſtanding. The Remonſtration of this demonſtrative in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
is thus: It is <hi>in confeſſo,</hi> and more then ſo, an undoubted <hi>Maxim</hi>
ſubſcribed unto by the Church of <hi>Rome;</hi> That the grace which is infuſed by
and from our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is a <hi>ſupernatural</hi> quality, or a qualification
more ſoveraign, then the firſt grace which God the Father beſtowed upon the
Firſt Man. Now, if that Grace were a <hi>ſuper addition</hi> to his <hi>Nature,</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
as he was the work of God; the loſſe of this Grace or quality could
not have made any wound in the humane Nature, which the leaſt drop of
that Grace, which daily diſtilleth from the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> might not more
then fully cure. Yea, ſuch grace would ſublimate our Nature ſo cured, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an higher pitch or fuller meaſure of Righteouſneſſe, then that, which
was beſtowed upon our Father <hi>Adam.</hi> In reſpect of theſe and many
other Reaſons, which might be alledged, all ſuch Congregations or Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
of Chriſtian Men, as have departed, or have been extruded, out of
the Romiſh Church, ſtand deeply engaged, to deny, that the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of the Firſt Man was a Grace or quality ſupernatural.</p>

                  <p>1. TO affirm that, the Righteouſneſſe wherein the Firſt Man was created
was a gift rather Natural then ſupernatural, would be no <hi>ſolaeciſme:</hi> no

<pb n="3006" facs="tcp:100044:16"/>
albeit the manner of producing it were ſomewhat more then ſupernatural.</hi> But
this is a diſpute which for the preſent ſhall be waved, becauſe the Original
difference betwixt us and them may be more punctually ſtated, and the
Queſtions dependent on it, may be more clearly reſolved from theſe <hi>Poſtulata</hi>
or preſumed <hi>Maxims:</hi> Firſt, <q>
                        <hi>[That God did make the Firſt Man after his own
image.]</hi>
                     </q> Secondly, <hi>[That the Firſt man being ſo made, was righteous and juſt.]</hi>
Neither of theſe are denied by any. The ſtate of the Original Controverſie
unto ſuch as are diſpoſed to have it plainly propounded in conſtant or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleeting
Terms, is thus; <q>[Seeing man was made after the image of God, and
being ſo made, was juſt and righteous; <hi>Whether there were two works of God
or two diſtinct effects of his work of creating the Firſt Man in righteouſneſs and
in his own image: And whether the one of them was terminated to his own
image imprinted in man, and the other to his original juſtice.]</hi>
                     </q> If theſe two
expreſſions made by <hi>Moſes</hi> of <hi>Gods image</hi> and <hi>mans righteouſneſs,</hi> expreſſe or
include no more then one and the ſame work of God, or effect of his work in
man: The loſſe of Original juſtice or <hi>defacing</hi> of Gods image enſtamped
upon him, was more then a meer privation, and neceſſarily preſuppoſeth a
poſitive Cauſe in our Firſt Parents, and a poſitive Effect wrought by that
cauſe whereunto the privation of Original juſtice was Concomitant or rather
Conſequent. Whatſoever Controverſie may be moved concerning the
Cauſe or manner how this Effect was wrought: <hi>the effect it ſelf was a deadly
wound in our Nature;</hi> a multitude of wounds, all by Nature or any endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of Nature or performances of ſuch <hi>Free will</hi> as was left to mankind after
theſe wounds were once made, altogether incurable, without the help or
aſſiſtance of <hi>better Grace</hi> or endowments then were beſtowed upon the <hi>Firſt
Man.</hi> The cure of theſe wounds wholly depends upon that grace whoſe
Being and beſtowing the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> did merit from the Father of Lights,
or from the Divine nature or Deity.</p>
                  <p>2. To win the Aſſent of every Rational Chriſtian man unto the former
part of this determination; <hi>[That Original juſtice did conſiſt in that image of
God wherein the Firſt man was created, and did not imply any other work
of God whether preccdent or conſequent, beſides the ſpeciall work of his creation:]</hi>
no other Argument is either neceſſary or ſo available, as the taking of the
words of <hi>Moſes,</hi> where he deſcribes the manner how the <hi>Firſt man</hi> was creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
into ſerious conſideration. For <hi>Original Juſtice had more Eſſential de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence
upon the image of God in Man, then Rotunditie hath with a Sphere; or
Globoſitie with a Globe.</hi> Now in the making of a <hi>Sphere</hi> or body perfectly
round, there be not two works, nor two diſtinct effects of the Artificers ſkill;
one in making a <hi>Round-Body,</hi> another in making <hi>Rotunditie.</hi> And it is a groſſer
Soloeciſm in Divinity to ſay or think, that the <hi>Image of God</hi> in man was One
work of God, and <hi>Original Juſtice</hi> Another, then it would be to maintain
that the <hi>Rotundity</hi> of a <hi>Sphere,</hi> and the <hi>Sphere,</hi> are two works of the ſame

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.] The problem
in diſtinct and plain Engliſh is thus. <hi>[Whether it be poſſible according to the
Rules of Reaſon, that any created ſubſtance ſhould be from its creation totally ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
or abſolutely freed from all poſſibility of falling into ſin.]</hi> Some of the
Ancient and moſt Orthodoxal Fathers of the Church, as their opinions are
alledged by ſome School-men, ſtand for the Negative Part of this Problem,
to wit, <hi>[That it is not poſſible for any meer Creature to be from the moment or firſt
time of his creation altogether impeccable, or ſecured from all poſſibility of falling
into ſin.]</hi> But whether the reaſons or expreſſions of theſe Ancient Fathers
will reach home, or amount unto the <hi>Tenents</hi> of ſuch School-men as avouch,
not only their reaſons, but Authority, is not ſo clear; but that the diſcuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
whether of their Authorities, Meanings, or Expreſſions, might breed
more quarrels then the School-men have already begun. However; The
diſputes already moved about <hi>this Point,</hi> muſt in the firſt place be reſtrained
to meere Creatures rationall, that is, to Angels and Men. <hi>The Rational Creature,
or ſon of man, who is likewiſe the Son of God, muſt be exempted from this enquiry</hi>
And this <hi>Additional</hi> muſt in the ſecond place be admitted; <hi>[Whether it were
poſſible that any man or Angel could be perpetually freed from all poſſibility of fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
into ſin, and have been withall from the firſt moment of his creation intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecally
juſt and righteous.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. That Men and Angels might (by the power of God, or ſpecial contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of his Providence) have been ſecured from all poſſibility of falling into
ſin, is a Poſition amongſt rationall men unqueſtionable: But it is not ſo,
whether men or Angels being ſo ſecured from all poſſibility of ſinning could
have been intrinſecally or formally righteous, or by the eternall rules of
Juſtice and Equity it ſelf, truly capable of everlaſting puniſhments or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or of joy and happineſſe everlaſting. The <hi>Negative part</hi> of this <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme</hi>
is in my judgment far more probable then the <hi>Affirmative.</hi> For if the
<hi>First-man,</hi> or Angels which fell, had been either by the power of their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Creator, or by the undefeatable contrivance of his wiſdome, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
freed from all poſſibilitie of ſin from the firſt creation unto this day,
they could neither have deſerved any great blame or praiſe by continuing
after this manner righteous or conformable to the divine nature for integrity
of life. The caſe of the <hi>Firſt-man,</hi> if he had lived to this inſtant without ſin
by ſuch contrivance or neceſſitating guidance of Gods providence, had been
the ſame, as if the child whiles his maſter leads his hand ſhould write a <hi>Faire
Copie,</hi> being otherwiſe unable to caſt a letter aright when his maſters hand
ſhould betaken off from his. Now if the Child or young Clerk ſhould not
in good time learn to caſt his letters or draw his lines aright, he could not
pretend any title to commendation or reward, how well ſo ever his work
were performed; the whole praiſe would of right belong unto the <hi>manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction</hi>
or guidance of his Maſter. But if the young Clerk growing ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
ſhould diſturb or wreſt the hand of his guide awry, or not ſuffer him to
rule his hand as before he had done: by thus doing he would deſerve both
blame and correction.</p>

3. Our father <hi>Adam</hi> in his <hi>firſt Eſtate</hi> had a great deale more power to
regulate his own thoughts and actions by the ordinary Guidance of Gods
Providence, then a child hath either to caſt his Letters or draw his Lines a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right
by the ſight of a <hi>Copie</hi> or ordinary direction of his maſter. Yet this
ſame <hi>Firſt Man</hi> had a power withall to neglect the guidance, or ſlight the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections
of his Creator; a power much greater to do both theſe wayes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs,
then a child hath to refuſe or reſiſt the Manuduction of his writing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Maſter.
By the <hi>Firſt womans</hi> ignorance or contempt, through her huſbands
negligence or inadvertence to that <hi>Firſt and Great Commandement,</hi> which was

into the viſible world, that is, into the nature of man. The extract
of what we have ſaid, or have to ſay, Concerning this point, is very well ſet
down by St. <hi>Auſtine</hi> and ſome others of the Ancients; <hi>[That the First Man
was truly endowed with a Free-will or power, not to have ſinned at all: That if
he had uſed this power aright, or implored the aſſiſtance of his Creator in competent

a kinde of merit? This is a Queſtion not very pertinently moved by ſome
Schoole-men, and the Contradictory to their determination more inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately
maintained by ſome modern Diſputants or Logical Criticks. For
ſeeing <hi>Adam</hi> received <hi>that great Talent</hi> concredited to him in his creation, not
abſolutely, or to uſe it as he pleaſed, but at his perill or under expreſs pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty,
that if he miſimployed it, or contemned his Commandement which
beſtowed it upon him, he ſhould dye the death: it is no way improbable,
that if he had improved his Talent for ſome competent time, that the ſtate
wherein he was created ſhould have been hereditary to him and his; not
by ſuch <hi>free Grace</hi> as is beſtowed upon us under the Goſpell, but by way of
Merit <hi>de congruo;</hi> though not according to <hi>Commutative,</hi> yet to <hi>Distributive
Juſtice,</hi> rather then by <hi>meere Mercy</hi> or benignity. But this opinion I vent
not with any intention to move or abett diſputes or controverſies already
moved about this curious Queſtion; but rather to perſwade the Reader,
that all queſtions concerning the <hi>Merits of works,</hi> or of perſeverance in that
<hi>Grace</hi> by which all good works are wrought, muſt be reduced, or confined
to the eſtate or condition of mankinde ſince <hi>Adams</hi> Fall. Of which Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

that will ſoberly diſpute or conferr with me in it, better ſatisfaction, <hi>Vivâ

Points in it, or which I had in my thoughts either to proſecute or
propoſe,<note place="margin">The <hi>Firſt man</hi> was neither neceſſitated to continue good, nor to become Evil.</note> are theſe following.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That albeit the <hi>Firſt man</hi> were by vertue of Creation righteous
and juſt, yet were neither his perſeverance or non-perſeverance in this
righteouſneſſe abſolutely <hi>neceſſary;</hi> both of them <hi>poſsible.</hi> That both were
poſſible hath been declared at Large before in the ſixth book of Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
upon the Creed:<note place="margin">In the 2 Part, 2 Sect. Chap. 13. &amp;c. of the Attributes.</note> unto which I referr the <hi>Ingenuous Reader,</hi> where he
may finde this propoſition (as I take it) demonſtrated; <hi>[That to decree or
<pb n="3009" facs="tcp:100044:17"/>
appoint a mutual or reciprocal Poſſibility between our Firſt Parents perſeverance or
non-perſeverance was Facible to the Omnipotent Creator, becauſe it neither im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies
nor preſuppoſeth any Contradiction in Terminis.]</hi> And whatſoever ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
or praenotion anſwerable unto it implies no Contradiction either in it
ſelf or to the Goodneſſe of the Divine Nature or Deity, is Facible by Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Omnipotent: that is, The Almighty Creator might have decreed, or yet
may decree it when he pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p>The Second <hi>Principle</hi> or <hi>ſuppoſition</hi> in this place to be handled is; <hi>[Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the Almighty Creator did</hi> de Facto <hi>decree or ordain that neither the Perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
or non-perſeverance of the Firſt Man or of our Firſt Parents, ſhould be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
Neceſſary, but contingent.]</hi> Or, in other terms thus; <hi>[That the Eſtate
or condition wherein they were created might have continued to this day for them
and their ſucceſſors undefeatable.]</hi> That their Perſeverance or the perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of their Poſterity in the ſtate of Righteouſneſſe wherein they were
created, was not neceſſary by any Divine Ordinance or decree, is clear from
the Event; becauſe the <hi>Firſt man</hi> and the Firſt woman did fall <hi>de Facto</hi> from
that Eſtate wherein they were created, which neither of them could have
done, if their Firſt Eſtate had been by vertue of the Almighties Decree or any
ordinance from him <hi>Immutable,</hi> or abſolutely <hi>Neceſſary.</hi> But can it be as ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
proved, That the fall of our firſt Parents, or their eating of the <hi>Forbidden
Fruit</hi> did not proceed from any neceſſitating Decree, or undefeatable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance
of the Almightie Creators Wiſdom? To perſwade men which have
not their ſenſes exerciſed in points of Logical or Scholaſtick diſputes, that the
<hi>Fall</hi> of our Firſt Parents was not <hi>neceſſary,</hi> no, not in reſpect of the Divine
Decree or ordinance, would be a harder taſk, then to prove that their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance
was not in reſpect of that Decree, neceſſary. That our Firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
did fall from their Eſtate, is a <hi>Queſtion of Fact</hi> of which every honeſt
good man may be a competent Judge, at leaſt able enough to reſolve himſelf.
But whether it was as poſſible for them not to have fallen, as it was to fall,
is <hi>Queſtio Juris,</hi> or more then ſo, a point of Metaphyſical or Theological
diſquiſition; wherein it would be very hard to find a <hi>Grand-Jury</hi> of Profeſt
Divines in any one County almoſt throughout this Kingdom, which could
be competent Judges or fit Inquiſitors: Not that they want either ſkill or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
for interpreting ſacred Scripture, which is the only true rule of Faith
and manners, aright; but for want of ſkill or memory in <hi>Secular Arts,</hi> how
to examine or determine what <hi>Conſequences</hi> or inferences are conſonant or
diſſonant to the undoubted <hi>Rule of Faith,</hi> or to the unqueſtionable <hi>Maxims</hi>
contained in it. For deciding or waiving ſuch Controverſies as are emergent
not ſo much out of the ſence of Scriptures, as out of ſuch <hi>Inferences</hi> or <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences</hi>
(whether negative or affirmative) as contentious or unreſolved ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
would faſten upon it, <hi>Recta ratio,</hi> that is, Reaſon regulated by Rules of
unqueſtionable Arts or Sciences, is the moſt competent Judge. That there
is but one God and one Lord; That the only God is a <hi>God of Goodneſs</hi> and
willeth no wickedneſſe, are poſitive points of Faith and Chriſtian Belief;
Fundamental <hi>Maxims</hi> in Theologie. To diſpute or move any queſtion
directly about the truth or limitation of theſe <hi>Maxims,</hi> would be a branch of
Infidelity, or, which perhaps is worſe, an approach to Blaſphemy.</p>

which Actions can have no direct <hi>Terme,</hi> beſides the <hi>Vbi</hi> or Terme of lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call

diſtinctions betwixt the <hi>Act,</hi> and the <hi>Sinfulneſſe of it,</hi> in our Firſt Parents

connexion between death and the deadlieſt wound that can be given to any
man, as there is between <hi>Acts</hi> peremptorily forbidden by the Law of God,
and the <hi>Obliquitie</hi> or ſinfulneſſe of them. For there is not, neither is it

reſulting from them. Both of them come together, both in reſpect

between death and wounds given meritorious of Capital puniſhment,
there uſually is a diſtance of time, and oftentimes no abſolute or unpreven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

<hi>Diſtinction,</hi> of groſs error and ſomewhat more then ſo, will be to retort
their own Illuſtrations or juſtifications of it, upon themſelves; as I have
learned by ſucceſſefull Experience upon ſome learned <hi>Ingenuous students</hi>
which have revoked their own opinions, and reclaimed others upon the
reading of my meditations upon this argument in another Dialect.<note place="margin">In ſolenni Lectione</note> One of
the moſt uſuall <hi>Illustrations</hi> or intended corroborations of the former di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction
is borrowed from a Man, that rides a Lame or halting horſe. Such
a rider, ſay they, (eſpecially if he ride with ſwitch and ſpur,) is the Cauſe
why the horſe goes or runs as faſt as he can, but not the Cauſe of his lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
or of his halting. Of his lameneſſe, ſuppoſed he was lam'd before, the
Rider (I confeſs) is no Cauſe: yet of his actuall halting down-right, or of
<pb n="3015" facs="tcp:100044:20"/>
the increaſe of the lameneſs which will follow upon the unſeaſonable riding
or over-riding, he is the only Cauſe. For if the poor Beaſt might have reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his bones when he was enforced to trot or gallop, he would not have halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at all at that time, nor would he have been ſo grievouſly lame, as by
ſuch unſeaſonable uſage he is. But this inſtance or <hi>Illuſtration,</hi> ſuppoſe it
were not much amiſſe in reſpect of men now living, can no way ſute or fit
the <hi>Queſtion</hi> concerning the ſin of our Firſt Parents. For <hi>Adam</hi> at his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
was no way lame or defective either in ſoul or body, before he taſted
of the forbidden Fruit. Now if the Almighty Creator had been the cauſe
of this <hi>Act,</hi> he had been as true a Cauſe of the <hi>Firſt ſin,</hi> or of <hi>Adams</hi> halting in
his ſervice; as he that beſtrides a ſound and luſty horſe, and runs him upon
the ſpur in a rugged and ſtony ground, or in a deep way, is of the lame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,
of the death, or any diſeaſe which enſues ſuch deſperate riding.</p>
                  <p>4.<note place="margin">Many commit more groſs Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry with their own fancies, then the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then did with their Idols.</note> To imagin that God ſhould deal ſo hardly with the Firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> as to give
him a Law which he intended to make him break, and yet to puniſh him with
death for the breach of it; Or that the <hi>Second Adam,</hi> the wiſdom of God ſhould
ſend wiſe men and Prophets to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> to the intent or End that <hi>She</hi>
ſhould ſtone or put them to death; or for this purpoſe, that their bloud
ſhould in later dayes be required of Her, (as ſome in our times have publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
taught) is an <hi>Imagination</hi> in it ſelf much worſe and more dangerous
then the erection of <hi>Images</hi> (though Roman-wiſe) in Reformed Churches;
A greater Abomination then any Idol of the Heathens. For Images or Idols
are but the External Objects of, or enticements unto groſſe Idolatry. Nor
was it the Carpenter or Statuary that did make the Heathen gods or Idols:
Who then? <hi>Qui colit, ille facit;</hi> He or they alone turn
Images or Pictures into Idols or falſe Gods,<note place="margin">Qui fingit ſacros, auro vel marmore, vultus,</note> which worſhip
or adore them.<note place="margin">Non facit ille Deos; qui colit, ille facit.</note> But the former <hi>Opinion</hi> or imagination,
whether in reſpect of God, as he was the <hi>Firſt mans</hi> Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
or of the wiſdom of God,<note place="margin">Martial.</note> as he is <hi>our Lord and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,</hi>
is Intrinſecal and <hi>Formal Idolatry,</hi> or Idolatry in the <hi>Abſtract,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any external <hi>Object</hi> to dote upon, or to entice men to beſtow worſhip
upon it. The Heathens committed Idolatry in their Temples, or in their
houſes: but this <hi>Idolatry</hi> is committed <hi>within</hi> his <hi>Brain</hi> that entertains it:
The Eſſence of it formally conſiſts in the <hi>Reflexion of the Imagination upon it
ſelf,</hi> or in the complacency which men take in ſuch Reflexions; if any man
happily (which I much doubt) can be delighted with ſuch imaginations.
The very height of Heatheniſh Idolatry, as our Apoſtle inſtructs us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.
23, <hi>&amp;c. did conſiſt in changing the glory of the uncorruptible God, into an
image made like to corruptible man, and to birds, and four-footed beaſts, and
creeping things.</hi> Now if the wiſdom of God had ſent wiſe-men and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets
unto the Jews, unto the End that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſhould be deſtroyed, and
righteous bloud required of them, His weeping over <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> had better
reſembled or expreſſed the diſpoſition of a <hi>Crocodile,</hi> then the Nature either
of God or any good Man. Nor was it greater Idolatry in the Heathen, to

Neceſſary in reſpect of the Divine Decree,]</hi> hath been ſufficiently diſcovered
in the ſixth book of theſe Commentaries upon the Apoſtles Creed, Sect. 2.
Chap. 12. Where the Reader may find the Truth of this Propoſition or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
clearly demonſtrated; <hi>[That to Decree a Contingency in ſome works or
Courſe of Nature, in Humane Acts eſpecially, was as poſſible to him unto whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

Nature.]</hi> As for inſtance, To Decree or conſtitute that our Father <hi>Adam</hi>
ſhould have a <hi>Free power</hi> or Faculty either to eat or not to eat of the Forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den

to the Almighty Creator ſo to ordain or Decree. But many things (as
the obſervant Reader will except) are poſſible which are not probable, or
never are brought into Act. True; Yet that the Almighty Creator, did
<hi>de Facto,</hi> or actually decree, a <hi>Mutual Poſſibility</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> Falling and not
Falling, or between his Fall and Perſeverance, hath been in this preſent
Treatiſe, and in ſome others demonſtrated from the Article Concerning <hi>The
Goodneſs of God</hi> or his Gratious providence, by ſuch Demonſtration, as the
Caſe now in handling, is capable of: that is, by <hi>Evident Deduction</hi> of the
Contradictory Opinion, to this <hi>Impoſſibility,</hi> 
                     <q>That God otherwiſe was

<hi>Adams</hi> Falling or not Falling ſhould both be alike poſſible; that neither
ſhould or could be neceſſary either to the Firſt or Second Cauſes.</q> To deny
that God did ordain or conſtitute a true and <hi>Facible Mean</hi> between the <hi>Neceſsity</hi>
of <hi>Adams Perſeverance</hi> in the State wherein he was created, and the <hi>Neceſsity</hi> of
his <hi>Falling</hi> into ſin, that is, <hi>a mutual Poſſibility</hi> of <hi>falling</hi> or not of <hi>Falling</hi> into
ſin, would imply as <hi>Evident a Contradiction</hi> unto, or impeachment of his <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
as it would do to his <hi>Omnipotency,</hi> if any man ſhould peremptorily deny
that the Conſtitution or <hi>Tenour</hi> of ſuch a <hi>Decree</hi> were poſſible to his <hi>Almighty
power.</hi> To ſay, God could not poſſibly make ſuch a <hi>disjunctive Decree,</hi> or
ſuch a <hi>Tenour of mutual poſsibility</hi> betwixt things Decreed, as hath been often
mentioned, would be a groſſe <hi>Error,</hi> yet an error (I take it) not ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous,
as to deny that he did <hi>de Facto</hi> make ſuch a <hi>Decree.</hi> For our <hi>Gratious

                  <p>6. Thus much of the main general <hi>Query,</hi> Concerning the manner how
ſin (or that evil which we call <hi>Malum culpae)</hi> did find Firſt entrance into the
works of God, and in particular into the nature of Man: from the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of whoſe creation, he and all the reſt of Gods viſible works, had this
<hi>Elogium</hi> or commendation, that they were <hi>Exceeding Good<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> No entrance of
ſin into the works of God, into man eſpecially, was poſſible, without the
<pb n="3017" facs="tcp:100044:21"/>
Incogitancy or Inadvertency of a Free Cauſe or Agent. The <hi>true nature of
the firſt ſin</hi> and of its haynouſneſſe did eſpecially conſiſt in this, that whereas
our gratious Creator had endowed our <hi>Firſt Parents</hi> with a <hi>Power</hi> or faculty
to <hi>Doe well,</hi> exceeding well; and given them good encouragement to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere
in ſo doing, they ſhould ſo incogitantly and quickly abuſe this power,
and the <hi>Divine Concourſe</hi> or aſſiſtance that did attend it, to do that which
was evil; that which the Lord their Creator had ſo peremptorily forbidden
them to do, under commination of a dreadful puniſhment to enſue upon the
doing of it. The difficulty or main <hi>Querie</hi> which remains (all that hath been
ſaid being granted) is principally this: <hi>[How this one ſinful Act of our Firſt
Parents could poſſibly produce an Habit of ſin, or that which is more then a Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit,
an unmoveable cuſtome of ſin, or an Hereditary diſeaſe of ſinfulneſs through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all the ſucceſſions of the ſons of</hi> Adam, <hi>to the worlds end.]</hi> The ſecond
<hi>Querie,</hi> (yet in the firſt place to be diſcuſs'd) is this, <hi>[Wherein the nature of
that hereditary diſeaſe which we call Sin Original doth properly conſiſt.]</hi> The
third, <hi>[How this hereditary diſeaſe doth bring all mankind into a true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
ſervitude to ſin, and by ſin, unto Satan &amp;c.]</hi> In the diſcuſſion of this and
many other difficulties depending upon it, I ſhall endeavour to obſerve that
<hi>Rule</hi> which <hi>Chemnitius</hi> in many of his works hath commended to the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation

or out of thoſe paſſages, upon whoſe miſtakings or non-obſervance of them, many
Theological controverſies were firſt occaſioned, and are to this day abetted or

concerning the <hi>Extent</hi> or <hi>Limitation</hi> of it, there may be ſome Queſtion made,
or Scruple caſt in by the ordinary Hearer or Reader. For ſeeing as <hi>Solomon</hi>

<hi>Apoſtle</hi> to like purpoſe: <hi>If we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves, and
there is no truth in us:</hi> Then if it be univerſally true which our Saviour here
ſaith <hi>[whoſoever committeth ſin is the ſervant of ſin:]</hi> the very <hi>Redeemed</hi> of
the Lord, the beſt of his Saints here on earth may ſeem concluded to be
<hi>ſervants to ſin;</hi> ſeeing he that ſinneth, doth commit ſin. The <hi>Argument</hi> is
ſomewhat <hi>captious</hi> and would be ſtronger, if <hi>To commit ſin</hi> were a <hi>verb</hi> of the
<hi>preſent Tenſe,</hi> and were to be no further extended. But the word in the <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal,</hi>

in the Greek tongue, Eccleſiaſtick eſpecially, well knows) are according
to <hi>Hebraiſms</hi> moſt frequent in the Greek Teſtament, fully <hi>Equivalent to Latin
Verbals. Vinum appetere,</hi> that is, <hi>to call for a cup of wine,</hi> any ordinary man may
without impeachment to his ſobriety, or cenſure of temulency: But to be
<hi>Homo appetens vini,</hi> is in the Latin Tongue, a full Character or expreſſion of a
<hi>Wine-bibber</hi> or a Drunkard. So that <gap reason="foreign">

redeemed by the <hi>Free Grace of Chriſt,</hi> from the Dominion of ſin and Tyrannie

divers <hi>ſtems,</hi> roots, or branches. The Firſt root of ſin, was <hi>the ſin of the First

double, againſt the injuries both of
heate and cold: Man alone, poore
wretch, ſhe hath laid all naked upon
the bare Earth, even on his birth-day,
to cry and wraule preſently from the
very firſt houre that he is borne into
this world: in ſuch ſort, as among ſo
many Living Creatures, there is none
ſubject to ſhed teares and weep like
him. And verily to no babe or Infant
is it given once to Laugh before he be
forty daies old, and that is counted
very early and with the ſooneſt.
Moreover, ſo ſoon as he is entred in
this manner to enioy the Light of the
ſun, ſee how he is immediatly tyed
and bound faſt, and hath no member
at liberty; a thing that is not practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
upon the young whelps of any
beaſt among us, be he never ſo wild.
The Child of man thus untowardly
borne, and who another day is to
rule and command all other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> lo
how he Lyeth bound hand and foot,
weeping and crying, and beginning
his Life with miſery, as if he were to
make amends and ſatisfaction by his
puniſhment, unto Nature, for this on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Fault and Treſpaſſe, that he is
borne and brought into the world. O folly of all follies, ever to think
(conſidering this ſimple beginning of ours) that we were ſent into this
world to live in Pride and carry our head aloft! The firſt hope that we
conceive of our ſtrength, the firſt gift that time affordeth us, maketh us no
better yet then foure-footed beaſts; how long is it ere wee can goe alone?
How long before we can prattle and ſpeake, feed our ſelves, and chewe our
meat ſtrongly? What a while continueth the mould and crown of our heads
to beat &amp; pant, before our braine is well ſetled; the undoubted mark &amp; token
that bewrayeth our exceeding great weakneſſe above all other creatures:
What ſhould I ſay of the infirmities &amp; ſickneſs that ſoon ſeize upon our feeble
bodies: What need I ſpeak of ſo many medicines and remedies deviſed
againſt theſe Maladies: beſides the new diſeaſes that come every day, able
to check and fruſtrate all our proviſion of Phyſick whatſoever? As for all
other Living Creatures, there is not one, but by a ſecret inſtinct of nature
knoweth its own good, and whereto he is made able: Some make uſe of their
ſwift feet, Others of their flight wings: ſome are ſtrong of limmes, Others
are apt to ſwim, and practiſe the ſame: Man only knoweth nothing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
he be taught; He can neither ſpeake, nor goe, nor eate otherwiſe then
he is trained to it: And to be ſhort, apt and good at nothing he is naturally,
but to pule and crie. And hereupon it is, that ſome have been of this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
That better it had been, and ſimply beſt for a man, never to have
been born, or elſe ſpeedily to dye. None but wee do ſorrow and waile,
<pb n="3022" facs="tcp:100044:24"/>
none but we are given to exceſſe and ſuperfluity infinitely in every thing,
and ſhew the ſame in every member that we have. Who but we again
are ambitious and vain-glorious? Who but we are covetous and greedy of
gathering good? We and none but we deſire to Live long and never to die,
are ſuperſtitious, careful of our ſepulture and burial, yea, and what ſhall
betide us when we are gone? Mans life is moſt frail
of all others, and in leaſt ſecurity he Liveth: No
Creature Luſteth more after every thing then he:
None feareth Like unto him, and is more troubled
and amazed in his fright: and if he be ſet once upon
anger, none more raging and wood then he. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
all other Living Creatures Live orderly and
well, after their own kind: We ſee them flock and
gather together; and ready to make head and ſtand
againſt all others of a contrary kind: the Lions, as fell
and ſavage as they be, fight not one with another:

the Romans, until they had upon particular ſad accidents enacted a publick

from this unnatural ſin, unto the wiſdom of

unto this Crime, which He expected ſhould never

<hi>Solon,</hi> for the like reaſon, did not ſo much as mention
this Crime in His (otherwiſe) moſt ſevere Laws. But
this obſervation was taken from the Heathen Romans
in times ancient and far more remote, and doth not
(as happily will be objected) hold in theſe times or
places wherein we live. Yet the Ingenuous and
Learned French<note n="†" place="margin">Thuanus.</note> Hiſtorian, (who meddles with the
Hiſtory of his own times only) tels us, that the like
unnatural ſin towards Children or Infants did never
come to ſo high and far-ſpreading a <hi>Flow</hi> in the great
City of that Kingdom, until <hi>the State</hi> or Parliament had erected a peculiar
<hi>Court</hi> to be held, for examination or trial of ſuch Cruel Mothers as ſought
to ſalve the breach of one Commandment by the violation of another; to
cover the ſhame of their own wantonneſſe, by murthering the tender fruits
of their folly: as if the <hi>Damme</hi> which the Law had ſet for repreſſing or ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
the Courſe of this bloudy ſin, had but provoked the ſtream or Current,
to ſwell higher and greater; to overburſt all obſtacles or inhibitions which
the Laws of God, the Laws of Nature, and of the Kingdom, had ſet
againſt it.</p>

ſhould grow into a <hi>Proverb</hi> throughout moſt Chriſtian Kingdoms or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
as if theſe or like tranſgreſſions in our profeſſion, were of ſuch a
<pb n="3025" facs="tcp:100044:25"/>
ſcantling as could hardly be matched by the Laitie; I cannot give a more
probable reaſon (if the imputation be true, or the occaſion of the Proverbe
juſt) then this; That <hi>Men of our profeſſion,</hi> who are <hi>Gods peculiar Inheritance,
are bound by the Lawes of God to more ſtrict obſervance of our Saviours praecepts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
Humility, Meekneſſe, Brotherly-love, and Charity, or peaceable diſpoſicion

Cauſe why the Law was given: For ſo the <hi>Law-giver</hi> might be ſuſpected to
have been the <hi>Author of ſin,</hi> or at leaſt of the increaſe or abundance of it in
the world. The Apoſtles meaning is, that <hi>the Law was given as a praepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
Phyſick or medicine,</hi> to let ſuch as were ſick of ſin (as all were before
the Law was given) underſtand, in what danger they were; or, to give
them notice of the abundance of corruption which was ſo deeply ſeated in
their Nature, that it could not be throughly purged by the Law, which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſet ſin a working, that men might ſeek more eagerly after a <hi>Better medicine,</hi>
to wit, <hi>Faith in Chriſt.</hi> That this was our Apoſtles true meaning in this
place is apparent from the <hi>Parallel-paſſages</hi> to theſe: Romanes, <hi>Chap.</hi> 7. 7.
<hi>what ſhall we ſay then? is the Law ſin? God forbid: Nay I had not known ſin</hi> (that
is, I had not taken true notice of the meaſure or danger of it) <hi>but by the Law:
for I had not known Lust, except the Law had ſaid, Thou ſhalt not Covet.</hi> The
<pb n="3026" facs="tcp:100044:26"/>
Law to which theſe words referr, is the tenth Commandement: wherein
the Coveting of ſome few particulars, as of our Neighbours Wife, or of his
goods, is only expreſly forbidden: But ſin taking occaſion by this <hi>Negative
Commandment,</hi> wrought in our Apoſtle (as he himſelf teſtifies) all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of <hi>Concupiſcence; for without the Law ſin was dead:</hi> that is, He did not
feel the Motions or <hi>Paroxyſmes</hi> of ſin, untill the Law was laid unto him, as
a <hi>Preparative Medicine</hi> unto better <hi>Phyſick.</hi> And againe <hi>ver.</hi> ninth. <hi>I was

                        </gap>n revived, and
I died.</hi> And againe, <hi>ver. 11. 12. 13. Sin taking occaſion by the Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
deceived me, and by it ſlew me. Wherefore, the Law is Holy, and the
Commandement Holy, and just and good. Was that then which is good, made
death unto me? God forbid: But ſin, that it might appeare ſin, working d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ath in
me by that which is good; that ſin by the commandement might become exceeding
Sinfull.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a Point obſervable and fully paralel to our Apoſtles doctrine; <hi>That
the Eaſterne part of the world did rather loath then long after Circumciſion, Vntill
our Saviours Reſurrection and the Apoſtles peremptory forbidding the practiſe of it.</hi>
From the former doctrine of our Apoſtle I have learned ſatisfaction to a
<hi>Probleme</hi> which had often and long Perplexed my thoughts. The <hi>Probleme</hi>
was this: Why Men, Unto whoſe care and fidelity a man might ſafely
commit his Fortunes or his life upon their honeſt word, became moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
and unfaithfull in matters whereto they are punctually tyed by oath?
The reaſon is, Becauſe the interpoſition or obligation by oath, is as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of a Law which provokes the Corruption of Nature, whoſe longing or
luſt after things forbidden rather then it ſhould be unſatisfied, drawes men
otherwiſe morally honeſt, to become like wayward intemperat Patients,
which rather choſe to nouriſh the longing humours of the diſeaſe or infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
then to obſerve the preſcription of the Chirurgeon; ready to pull off the
plaiſter though with the live-skin or fleſh, rather then to endure the working
of it for a moment.</p>
                  <p>4. But here ſome have Queſtioned, <hi>Whether this Chapter be meant of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
or Vnregenerate Man?</hi> A <hi>Captious Interrogatorie;</hi> if Regeneration
were but one <hi>Act,</hi> or a reſultance of ſome <hi>Few Acts</hi> or Conflicts between
the Fleſh and the Spirit. But ſeeing <hi>Regeneration, in true Theologie, includes
Acts almoſt numberleſſe, or a Combate ſomewhat longer, then Mortification doth:</hi>
This Chapter, <hi>if we ſpeak of Chriſtians,</hi> muſt be Meant, not of the Man truely
Regenerated or perfectly Mortified, but of a Man, <hi>Inter Regenerandum,</hi>
during the intermediate <hi>Acts or conflicts</hi> betwixt the beginning and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation
of his<note n="*" place="margin">See the 9 Article of the Church of England.</note> Regeneration. Or if we ſpeake of <hi>One that beleeves the Old
Teſtament</hi> better then the New, as of a Jew or Mahumetane: it cannot be
meant of a <hi>Lawleſſe Man,</hi> but of a man under the <hi>hammer of Gods Law</hi> given by
<hi>Moſes.</hi> For there muſt be a Laying of ſome Law or Other, to the heart,
before the <hi>Conflict</hi> here Mentioned can begin; or Sin inherent, be ſo Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked,
as our Apoſtle tells us, it is.</p>
                  <p>5.<note place="margin">Why Sin Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall is more provoked by the Negative, then by the Affirmative Precepts.</note> He that will diligently peruſe our Apoſtles forementioned Paſſages
<hi>Romans</hi> 7. in the Language wherein he wrote, will eaſily obſerve with me,
That <hi>the occaſion which Sin tooke</hi> By the Law to deceive him, (as it doth yet
to deceive us;) was from the <hi>Negative Precepts</hi> or Commandements of the
Law; not from the <hi>Poſitive or Affirmative.</hi> Now why the <hi>Negative Precepts;</hi>
that one eſpecially, <hi>[Thou ſhalt not Lust; Thou ſhalt not Covet;]</hi> ſhould a great
deale more provoke or more forcibly revive the ſeeds of <hi>Originall Sin</hi> inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
in us, then the <hi>Affirmative Precepts</hi> uſually doe; the <hi>Reaſon</hi> is <hi>Evident;</hi>
                     <pb n="3027" facs="tcp:100044:26"/>
becauſe, nothing is nominated or propoſed unto us in the <hi>Affirmative</hi> Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts,
but that which in its nature is truely and ſincerely Good, without the
mixture of Evill: And being ſuch, is more apt to revive or quicken the
<hi>Notions</hi> of the Law of Nature, or Reaſon, or thoſe <hi>Reliques of Gods Image</hi>
which remaine in our Nature ſince our firſt Parents fall; then to <hi>Enlive</hi> the
ſeeds of ſin, or to provoke our inclinations unto Evill. On the contrary;
In every <hi>Negative Precept</hi> there is a <hi>Propoſall</hi> or repreſentation of thoſe things,
which be in their <hi>Nature truely Evill;</hi> and therefore moſt apt to incite or
provoke our natural Inclinations unto the evill forbidden, or to enrage the
Reliques of our firſt Parents ſin inherent in Us; after the ſame manner and
for the ſame reaſon, that the repreſentation of red Colours (without
any other Provocation given) is, to provoke or ſtirre the blood of beaſts
or Cattel, which are of a more pure or ſanguine Conſtitution. Thus ſome

poſſibly produce a perpetuall <hi>Habit</hi> of Sin in themſelves, or an <hi>Hereditarie

full and cleer Solution of it only ſurpaſſeth the reach of Reaſon meerely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
or of <hi>Philoſophy</hi> not enlightened by <hi>ſacred Hiſtory</hi> or <hi>Moſaicall Relations</hi>

had been ſo happy as to have diligently peruſed and beleeved the <hi>Oracles

might have had more ſatisfactorie Reſolutions for clearing this Point,
then we can gather from the <hi>Schoole-men</hi> or many of the <hi>Ancient Fathers.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Gregorius de Arimino.</note> Some <hi>Schoole-men</hi> do think that our Nature was corrupted by the poyſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
breath of the old Serpent in his conference with our Mother <hi>Evah.</hi> I
neither know nor remember whether they have any ground of this conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
from true Antiquitie; or whether it be a <hi>Maſterleſſe</hi> piece of their own
coyning. The conjecture or Phancie it ſelf is for this reaſon Leſs probable,
becauſe the Nature of our Father <hi>Adam,</hi> who held no parlie with the old
Serpent, was no leſs corrupted then the Nature of his Conſort <hi>Evah.</hi> Other
good writers are of opinion, that the fruit of the <hi>Tree of knowledge of Good
and Evill</hi> was for its ſpecifical quality <hi>of a poyſonous Nature</hi> both to the Soul and
body; at Leaſt, apt to taint or corrupt both: and the firſt mans nature was
tainted by taſting or eating of it: For of it he did eate as much as <hi>Evah</hi> did, if
not more, though ſhe were more in the tranſgreſſion, becauſe ſhe had pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
it from the tree. And I cannot conjecture any ground why any ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Reader of the ſacred Story ſhould peremptorily reject this opinion,
which I (for my poore talent in Divinite,) hold in ſome better eſteem then
a meere or probable conjecture. No <hi>Article</hi> of Chriſtian Faith it is, (though
we ſhould ſuppoſe Faith it ſelf to be no more then an Opinion) yet to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
into the Liſt of <hi>piè Credibilia,</hi> or to be ranked amongſt ſuch opinions,
as may be more piouſly and more ſafely beleeved, then peremptorily reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
or derided. The Conſequence of this Opinion or Suppoſition is, That
<hi>Adam did become his own Executioner,</hi> Or as the <hi>Canoniſts</hi> ſpeak, <hi>incidere in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonem,</hi>
did abſolutely inflict that puniſhment upon himſelf, unto which his
Creator had but conditionally ſentenced him. <hi>Gen. 2. 17. But of the Tree
of the knowledge of Good and Evill, thou ſhalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou
eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely dye.</hi> There was no <hi>Neceſſity</hi> Laid upon him by
his Creator that he ſhould eat of it; but ſuch a peremptory Reſtraint or
Command to the Contrary, that whenſoever he did eat of it, Death ſhould
neceſſarily follow. And ſo it did; for <hi>Mortality</hi> and Corruption did enter
into his Nature with the Figg or Apple which he taſted, not only upon the
ſame <hi>day</hi> wherein he taſted it, but in the very ſame <hi>moment.</hi> And the ſame
mortality and corruption are propagated to all his Sons from the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or point of time wherein they begin to be his Sons. Or more briefly,
<pb n="3030" facs="tcp:100044:28"/>
The <hi>Forbidden Fruit,</hi> of what ſort ſoever it were, <hi>did as truly beget</hi> or bring
forth corruption and <hi>Mortality</hi> in our Nature, <hi>as Adam did beget Cain,</hi> or
<hi>Evah</hi> bring him forth.</p>
                  <p>2.<note place="margin">Objections that are or can be made againſt the former Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered.</note> But it may be (and I preſume will be) Objected, That not the <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden
Fruit</hi> only, but the whole <hi>Tree</hi> whereon it grew, root and branch,
were immediately created by God, before <hi>Adam</hi> could taſte or eat of it.
And if it were for ſpecifical quality poyſonous, or did neceſſarily taint the
whole humane Nature, being once taſted of: How can either Fruit or Tree
be conceived to be any part of Gods ſix-days-works, all of which were <hi>very
good?</hi> Or how ſhall we ſalve, or be able to maintain that <hi>Maxim</hi> of the <hi>Wiſe
man [God did not create death,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Wiſd. 1. 13.</note>] ſeeing he did create that poyſonous Fruit,
by which our Nature was deadly poyſoned? <hi>Facilis Solutio,</hi> the anſwer is
ready: Albeit deadly poyſon be not <hi>Good</hi> to him that takes it, yet, that there
ſhould be poyſon, or herbs and fruits in their nature poyſonous, as well as
medicinal or wholſom, is, and from the beginning was very <hi>Good. Good</hi> like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
it was; <hi>exceeding Good,</hi> that the <hi>Firſt man</hi> ſhould have death as well
as Life propoſed to his <hi>Free or unneceſſitatible choice.</hi> So the whole fault was
in himſelf; no part in the fruit which God had forbidden him to eat: For
he by thus eating of it did chuſe death before life. And however the fruit,
which we ſuppoſe to have carried deadly poyſon with it into his body,
were immediately created by God: Yet that of the Prophet is more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
true of our firſt Parents, then of <hi>Iſrael</hi> unto whom it was directed,
<hi>Perditio tua ex te; O Adam, Thou waſt the cauſe of thine own</hi> and of our <hi>deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction:</hi>
But of our ſalvation in and through the promiſed ſeed, Our gratious
Creator is the <hi>ſole Cauſe</hi> and Author. Again, Albeit <hi>Adam</hi> did exceeding
ill in chuſing death before Life: yet <hi>This</hi> in the Conſequence, by ſpecial di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpenſation
of divine Mercy, was <hi>Good</hi> for us. Our Nature was not ſo much
wounded or made worſe by that <hi>unhallowed Food,</hi> as our perſons are better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and our eſtate amended by the <hi>new Covenant</hi> in Chriſts bloud; unleſſe we
abuſe thoſe Talents which our Gratious Creator and Red<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>emer hath given
us, as <hi>Adam</hi> did his. Were Free choice left unto us which now are living;
Whether we would accept that eſtate or Condition of life wherein <hi>Adam</hi>
was created, or that which is granted us by the new Covenant in Chriſts
bloud: He ſhould commit as great a folly as our Firſt Parents did, that
would not embrace the <hi>later Condition</hi> and refuſe the <hi>Former.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3 But for the former <hi>Difficulty,</hi> How more then a <hi>Habit</hi> of ſin; an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary
diſeaſe</hi> of nature, ſhould be produced by one or two <hi>Acts,</hi> I am
afraid ſome men make it ſeem a great deal greater then it is, more by their
own incogitancy then by any poſitive Argument that can be brought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large
or preſſe it further, then at the firſt ſight it appears to every young
Student. Firſt, theſe men take it not into conſideration that our <hi>Firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents</hi>
might commit more <hi>Actual ſins then that One</hi> often mentioned, before
the corruption of nature was propagated to their Succeſſors. Beſides The
<hi>Alteration of their diet,</hi> change of dwelling and air, might depreſſe their
nature, and diſpoſe then to a deeper degree of Mortality and Corruption
then they were ſubject unto when they were firſt driven out of Paradiſe.
And Paradiſe for ought we know, or can poſſibly object to the contrary,
might, for many conveniences and conducements to preſervation of health
whether of body or minde, exceed all other habitations, as far as Princes
<hi>Palaces</hi> do common Gaoles. What further impreſſions other occurrences
beſides theſe mentioned, intervenient between our <hi>Firſt Parents</hi> Grand-ſin
and the birth of <hi>Cain,</hi> of <hi>Seth,</hi> or others of their Children, from whom all
<pb n="3031" facs="tcp:100044:28"/>
the Kindreds of the earth Lineally deſcended, might make in the nature pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated
from them; or what effects or <hi>Symptomes</hi> our mother <hi>Evah's Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
after the forbidden Fruit might leave in her ſelf or in her Children, is
unknown to us: yet a Point to be conſidered by ſuch as think it ſcarce poſſible
for <hi>one Act</hi> to produce a <hi>Habit.</hi> This we know in general; That the eager
Longings of Mothers, or diſtaſtes or affrightments taken by them, do often
imprint many hereditary diſpoſitions in their Children. And from this
original, all or moſt of thoſe ſtrange <hi>Antipathies</hi> unto meats or drinks in
themſelves good and wholſome, and unto other Live or Liveleſſe creatures
no way noyſome, do (as Learned Phyſitians reſolve us) naturally iſſue. Yet
no <hi>Antipathies</hi> in private families can be ſo perpetually hereditary, as thoſe
<hi>inclinations</hi> unto Evil, or <hi>Antipathies</hi> unto goodneſſe, which proceeded
from the Firſt well-head or ſpring of our Nature, to wit, from our mother
<hi>Evah:</hi> That being once corrupted, could not but corrupt the whole current.
As for <hi>Evah's</hi> Luſting after whatſoever other unlawful pleaſures, her <hi>Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
after the Fair-ſeeming Fruit of the <hi>Tree of Knowledge,</hi> we may hence ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to have been very intemperate and exuberant beyond the ordinary ſize
of unruly appetites; in that, <hi>Holineſs with ſobriety</hi> is more ſpecially at Leaſt
under more expreſſe Condition required unto the ſalvation of the weaker
ſex, as our Apoſtle hath it, 1 <hi>Tim. 2. 15. Notwithſtanding, ſhe ſhall be ſaved
in Child-bearing, if ſhe continue in faith and charity, and holineſſe with ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi>
And ſo is abſtinence from ſome peculiar ſins, or from Occaſions of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations
to ſuch ſins as their Progenitors have been moſt prone unto, more
peremptorily required in their Children, then in Other Men whoſe Ance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors
or Progenitors have not been tainted with the like ſins, nor obnoxious
to like temptations.</p>
                  <p>4.<note place="margin">Whether all branches of ſin Original do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily ſpring from our firſt Parents Sin.</note> But here if any man be otherwiſe minded or diſpoſed to contradict
what I have ſaid or ſhall briefly ſay Concerning this point, I profeſſe I ſhall
not be willing to debate the <hi>Probleme</hi> any further with him. Only I muſt
for mine own part proteſt, that there never yet aroſe any doubt or queſtion

our Firſt Parents. Yet I would intreat the Reader to take this Conſideration
along with him; That ſuch Hereditary ill diſpoſitions or inclinations to ſome
peculiar vices as we mean, may abate, remit, or revive and be improved
through ſeveral ſucceſſions or collateral Lines of the ſame <hi>Stem,</hi> unto which
they are (for ſome generations) Hereditary, or finally expire, after the
ſame manner that ſimilitude of bodily Lineaments, feature, or viſages do
vary, alter, or expire in many Ancient families: Some Children being more
true pictures of their Great Grand-fathers or Grand-fathers or great Uncles,
then of their immediate Parents: Others again more like their immediate pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
then to any of their Anceſtors, whether by father or mother. Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Cauſe or manner How ſimilitudes of feature, of bodily Lineaments
or viſages do or may abate or remit in the firſt or ſecond Deſcent, and revive
in third or fourth;<note place="margin">Vid. inter ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>os Franciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum Vallerio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam in comm. in Hippocr.</note> this the Reader muſt learn from Philoſophers or Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians,
as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> or <hi>Galen,</hi> which of purpoſe have ſearched into this ſecret
of Nature For illuſtration of the maner, how hereditary indiſpotions of the
heart or affections may abate, revive, or expire in the ſeveral Deſcents of
families, the determination of that moral Probleme <hi>[An nobilitas generis

                     <pb n="3032" facs="tcp:100044:29"/>
Now that <hi>Nobility</hi> of Bloud, or thoſe inclinations unto <hi>Heroical vertues</hi> for
which ſome Ancient Families have been famous, do not neceſſarily ceaſe or
expire through the vitiouſneſſe of one Succeſſion, was a point determined
in the Schools when I firſt knew them. And Experience may teach a Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Liv'd
Obſervant man, that <hi>Two</hi> vitious or lewde Succeſſors do not often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſo abate or utterly <hi>dead</hi> thoſe ſeeds of vertue which were propagated
to them from their Anceſtors, but that they may revive, or be impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
in the <hi>Fourth Generation</hi> or Deſcent. The abating, reviving or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring
of them depends moſt upon their Education: And ſo doth the abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
or improvement of <hi>Original Sin</hi> or inclinations unto Evil. Even <hi>that
Corruption</hi> of Nature which we neceſſarily draw from the loſſe of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi>
is not equal in all the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> though it be moſt true; That every one
of us is as truly <hi>tained</hi> with <hi>it,</hi> as any Other. Again, though it be <hi>univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
true;</hi> That all men are by Nature Sinners; all deſtitute of the Grace of
God: Yet is it no part of this <hi>Vniverſal truth;</hi> to deny That ſome Race or
Brood of Men are from their birth or Conception, much more by Educati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
more graceleſſe then Others are. And yet for ſuch as have the leaſt
meaſure of ſin, whether <hi>Original, Habitual,</hi> or <hi>Actual;</hi> Or for men as we
terme them, of <hi>Sweet Diſpoſitions</hi> or Good nature, it is as impoſſible to be

Illyricus</hi> I mean; a man moſt happy in <hi>Political</hi> undertakings and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chivements,

in his Treatiſe Concerning the <hi>Nature of Original Sin,</hi> or the nature of ſin in
general, <hi>Two wayes</hi> unfortunate: <hi>Firſt,</hi> in that he was not ſo profound a
Philoſopher or exquiſite Artiſt, as it were fitting Every Divine, which will
undertake to handle this part of Divinity, or others which have connexion
with it, ſhould be: <hi>Secondly,</hi> in that he was a better Philoſopher and more
exquiſite Artiſt by much, then ſuch Divines, whether in reformed Churches
or others, which have taken upon them to rectifie or confute his Errors.
Theſe for the moſt part run a wider Byaz on the left hand towards the <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals,</hi>
then he doth on the right hand from the <hi>Real Philoſophers or Divines.</hi>
This man went the right way to his work, and begun it like a good Artiſt,
by defining or diſplaying the Nature or Eſſence of <hi>Original Righteouſneſs,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
he entred into that diſpute Concerning the Nature of <hi>Original Sin,</hi> or
unrighteouſneſſe. He rightly and upon demonſtrative grounds denies <hi>Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
Righteouſneſs</hi> to be any quality <hi>ſupernatural,</hi> any Accident or property
<pb n="3033" facs="tcp:100044:29"/>
adventitious to the Humane nature; if we conſider <hi>that</hi> in the Eſtate wherein
<hi>it</hi> was firſt created. Nor did he commit any error (much leſſe incur any
cenſure of Hereſie) by avouching <hi>Original Righteouſneſs</hi> to have been the
<hi>Eſſential form</hi> of man, if he had expreſsd his meaning with this addition, or
limited his expreſſions thus; [<q>As the Firſt man was the work of God, or
conſidered as he was created in His Image.</q>] For (as I am forced often to
repeat) there were not in mans Creation <hi>Two works</hi> of God really diſtinct,
either in order of <hi>nature</hi> or in reſpect of <hi>time;</hi> nor ſo diſtinct, as that <hi>The
One</hi> might be imagined to be the Nature of the firſt man, or of Gods image
in Him, <hi>The other,</hi> a Coronation of his Nature, or image of God, with a
Grace or righteouſneſſe ſupernatural. For <hi>Righteouſneſs original,</hi> to ſpeak
properly, could be no other work or Effect imaginable, ſave only the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultance
of that image of God wherein our Nature was firſt moulded. And
this Reſultance was as immediate unto, and as unſeparable from the image
of God wherein the firſt man was created, as <hi>Roundneſs</hi> is from a perfect
<hi>ſphere,</hi> or well moulded bullet; or as <hi>Equality</hi> is from <hi>Identity of quantity:</hi>
Of none of which there can be two diſtinct Cauſes or Operations.</p>
                  <p>2. To make the <hi>Image of God</hi> or that righteouſneſſe, which by immediate
neceſſity reſulted from Gods image or work, the <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> nature, or eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
form of man, <hi>quâ talis,</hi> as he is man; would be a groſſe Error or grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
<hi>Soloeciſm</hi> in Philoſophy: For ſo <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould not have been the ſame
individual Party or Perſon after his <hi>Fall,</hi> which he was before. And this
Error in <hi>Philoſophy</hi> uncontrol'd, would neceſſarily <hi>induce</hi> a more dangerous
<hi>Hereſie in Divinity,</hi> to wit; [That the ſame party which was made righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
by God, ſhould not be puniſhed for loſing this Righteouſneſſe, but ſome
other for him.] By the ſame reaſon the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> it ſelf, which is
now polluted by ſin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhould not be ſo much as <hi>ſpecifically the ſame</hi> with that
which God did in the beginning create; Our Nature as now it ſtands, ſhould
be wholly a work or Creature of the Devil.</p>
                  <p>3. But this Good writer, I mean <hi>Illyricus, iterum &amp; identidem,</hi> often and
again diſclaims all Opinion or thought conceived by him of any <hi>Specifical

<hi>Real Definition</hi> of an <hi>Eclipſe,</hi> whether in the Moon, Sun, or other ſtars? No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
beſides the aſſignation of the <hi>Reall Cauſe</hi> by which this defect of light
is wrought, whether in the Sun or Moon. The <hi>Reall cauſe</hi> of this privation
of Light in the moon is the <hi>Diametral interpoſition</hi> of the ſhadow of the earth
between the Moon and the Sun, from whom as from the Fountain of Light,
this ſecond <hi>Light</hi> or <hi>Governeſſe</hi> of the night doth borrow its Light or Splen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor.
Albeit of theſe two <hi>Definitions,</hi> the <hi>Grammatical</hi> or <hi>Nominal</hi> be moſt
proper: Yet the <hi>Cauſal,</hi> (though taken alone as Philoſophers uſe to expreſs
it) is moſt <hi>Reall</hi> and more ſatisfactorie. An <hi>Eclipſe in the Moon is the interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Earth betwixt the Sun, and it:</hi> The <hi>Eclipſe of the Sun is the interpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the body of the Moon betwixt the Sun, and us,</hi> that be inhabitants of the
Earth. Hence we may Learne that however the <hi>Nominal</hi> or <hi>Eſſential Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition</hi>
of an <hi>Eclipſe,</hi> whether in the Sun or Moon or other Starr, that is, a
<hi>Privation of Light,</hi> be One and the ſame: Yet we may Learne more from the
<hi>Cauſal Definition</hi> of either of them, then we can from the <hi>Nominal Definition</hi> of
both. In an <hi>Eclipſe</hi> of the Sun there is no defect or privation of Light in it:
We inhabitants of the Earth onely are deprived of the light or Luſtre of
this glorious ſtarr, by the interpoſition of the body of the Moon between it,
and our bodily ſight. Whence we may truly inferr, that the body of the
Moon is in it ſelf as impenetrable by Light, or as uncapable of <hi>Tranſmiſſion</hi> or
free paſſage of Light through it, as the body of the Earth is; That the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
only of this great ſtarr is capable of Light by reflexion, as a Globe of
ſteel or other ſolid Body, whoſe ſurfaces are ſmooth and Equable: It doth
not, it cannot tranſmit Light, or ſuffer it to be tranſfuſed through it after
<pb n="3035" facs="tcp:100044:30"/>
the manner of glaſs. Yet if we ſhould give a perfect and abſolute <hi>Definition</hi>
of an <hi>Eclipſe</hi> in the <hi>Moon,</hi> we muſt add the Abſtract or <hi>nominal Definition</hi> of
the <hi>Eclipſe</hi> unto the <hi>Reall</hi> or Philoſophicall: As thus; <hi>The Eclipſe of the moon
is a true and reall privation of light or ſplendor, not in reſpect of us only, but in it
ſelf; cauſed by the interpoſition of the body of the Earth, which hindereth the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of light which it borrowes from the Sun. But the Eclipſe of the Sun is only a
privation of our ſight or view of it, occaſioned or cauſed by the interpoſition of the
dark body of the Moone betwixt this glorious Starr and fountaine of light and our eyes.</hi>

St. <hi>Auſtin, Aquinas,</hi> and <hi>Melancthon</hi> ſay in effect as much as <hi>Illyricus</hi> did,
if their meanings were rightly apprehended or weighed by their Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers:
Yet his Expreſſions of the <hi>Nature, Cauſe,</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of <hi>Original Sin,</hi>
were to his own, and ſo they are to my apprehenſion more cleare, more
full and real, then any <hi>Definitions</hi> of <hi>Aquinas</hi> or <hi>Melancthon,</hi> Even where
they ſpeake moſt fully according to their own Principles, unto this point.
<hi>Aquinas</hi> (as this Author quotes him) ſome where grantes, <hi>Originale peccatum
non eſſe meram privationem juſtitiae originalis; that Original Sin is not only a meere
privation or want of Original Righteouſneſſe, but a poſitive or forcible inclination
contrary to it. Melancthon</hi> with many Others of the moſt Learned writers
which have been in the <hi>Germane</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Church ſince <hi>Luther</hi> began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce

all of whom reſpectively grant as much, and ſome of them more
then is included in the <hi>Definitions</hi> or deſcriptions of Sin, forecited out of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi>
and <hi>Melancthon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. <hi>Illyricus</hi> defines <hi>Originall Sin</hi> not by the <q>

corrupted,</hi> or transformed out of that Image of God which was ſeated in them
by Creation, into the image or real ſimilitude of Satan. In man conſidered

their Regeneration,</hi> or Purification of their hearts by Faith. If every
Part, if every <hi>Faculty</hi> or member of the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> be from the

how any Part or Faculty ſhould be abſolutely freed from all degrees

freed from it, and acknowledge ſome <hi>Reliques</hi> of <hi>Sin Original</hi> to remain in
every part or Faculty of the man truly <hi>Regenerate</hi> or renewed in the ſpirit of
his mind. It may in the <hi>First place</hi> be conceived that <hi>the Mind or Conſcience of
men ſo renewed, may be throughly cleanſed, not only from the guilt, but from
the real ſtain or pollution of ſin, and yet the fleſh or whole ſenſitive parts or facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the ſame man, ſtill lodge ſome Reliques of Original Corruption in them;
though in a Lower degree or Leſs meaſure, then the ſame Corruption dwelleth in
the Conſcience or Spirit of the unregenerate or Natural man,</hi> Or if we grant
the <hi>Minde</hi> and <hi>Conſcience of ſanctified men</hi> to be yet ſubject to ſome <hi>Tincture
or Reliques</hi> of Corruption: Yet theſe we muſt acknowledge to be ſo weak
and feeble that they cannot hinder or diminiſh the <hi>Raign or Soveraignty</hi> of the
<hi>Spirit</hi> over the fleſh, by which the Yoak of <hi>ſervitude</hi> unto Sin, or ſlavery
unto Satan (unto which all men before Regeneration are by Nature ſubject)
is utterly broken. If we conſider Man as he was firſt moulded by God, he
was for <hi>nature, ſubſtance,</hi> and <hi>Faculties</hi> of his ſoul, like a ſound Inſtrument
well ſtring'd and better tuned. But by eating of the forbidden fruit, and
loſſe of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> his very ſubſtance was corrupted and deprived of Life Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual:
and all his Powers or Faculties not only corrupted, but diſtuned. Our
Nature by Regeneration is Reſtored to Life ſpiritual, yet not to perfect
health and ſtrength ſo long as we carry this burden of Fleſh and Mortality
about with us. By the ſame <hi>Spirit of Regeneration</hi> the Powers or Faculties
of our ſouls, and our ſenſitive Affections, are better tuned then they were
before: yet not ſo ſound or well tuned as in the Firſt Creation they were,
but like to <hi>Aſymmetral</hi> or harſh voices which never hold conſort with ſounds
or voices truly <hi>Harmonical;</hi> or like to thoſe which we call <hi>Falſe ſtrings</hi> in a
ſtringed Inſtrument, which by no ſkill either of him that tunes or handles it,
can be brought to bear a part in exact <hi>Harmony:</hi> Both ſuch voices &amp; ſuch ſtrings
will ſtill retain ſome jarring ſound or diſcord in an accurate &amp; obſervant Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians
Ear; though much leſs when the ſtring is <hi>ſtricken open,</hi> or upon a Lower
<hi>ſtop,</hi> or the voice taken at a lower <hi>Key,</hi> then whe they are ſtretched higher. For
with the height of either ſound, the diſcord or Diſ-Harmony is ſtill increaſed.</p>

is not to take upon me either by voice or pen to inſtruct ſuch as are or take

warily and tenderly as any skilfull Chirurgion could do the moſt dangerous
ſores or ulcers of his moſt impatient Patients. For he did not ſay, <hi>If you
continue in my Word, then are ye my Diſciples indeed, and I will make you Free.</hi>
Although if he had thus ſaid, he had ſaid the Truth. For <hi>HEE</hi> it is, and

But it may be, That they intended their <hi>Anſwer</hi> only in reſpect of

                  <p>1. THat we may underſtand our own Eſtate by <hi>Nature,</hi> and the inheritance
whereunto we are intitled by <hi>Grace,</hi> better then the Jewes did, we are
to diſcuſſe theſe <hi>Three Points:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Wherein Civill Bondage or Servitude doth conſiſt; Or, What be
the Properties wherein Servants differ from Free-men:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> What Proportion or Analogie <hi>Servitude</hi> to Sin hath unto <hi>Civill
Servitude;</hi> And whether ſuch as our Saviour ſaith are truely <hi>Servants unto

Servants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the manner How the Son of God doth ſett us <hi>Free</hi> from the Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
or <hi>Servitude</hi> of Sin.</p>
                  <p>2.<note place="margin">Of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſlaves and Hired Servants.</note> 
                     <hi>Servitude</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>Freedome:</hi> And we cannot well know what it
is to be a <hi>Servant,</hi> unleſſe we firſt know what it is to be a <hi>Free-man.</hi> We do
not meane a <hi>Free-man</hi> of this or that <hi>Corporation,</hi> but a <hi>Free-man</hi> ſimply, or
one that is <hi>Free</hi> by Birth or condition of Life. Every one in this ſenſe is ſaid
to be <hi>Free,</hi> that hath Right or power to diſpoſe of himſelf, of his Children,
of his Lands or Goods, or of his own Actions or Imployments. Every one
likewiſe is a <hi>Servant,</hi> that being come to full yeares is deprived of this Right
or power to diſpoſe of himſelf, of his Lands, of his Goods, of his Actions
or imployments either in whole or in part. As for <hi>Children</hi> or ſuch as are
under Yeares, though borne to be Lords over others, yet whileſt they are
under yeares, they are properly <hi>neither Free-men nor Servants:</hi> Although
as the Apoſtle teacheth us, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 1. 2. they participate more of the Nature
of <hi>Servants</hi> then of <hi>Free-men: Now I ſay, that the Heire as long as he is a Child,
differeth nothing from a Servant, though he be Lord of All, but is under Tutors and
Governours, untill the time appointed of the Father.</hi> For this Reaſon, one and
the ſame word in the Original is promiſeuouſly uſed for Children and for
Servants, becauſe Neither of them are at their own diſpoſals, but at the
diſpoſals of their Guardians or maſters.</p>
                  <p>3. According to the ſeverall Extents of this want of Power or Right to
diſpoſe of themſelves, of their Actions or Imployments; Or rather, Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the Extent of others Right or Power to diſpoſe of them in all
theſe, there be ſeverall <hi>Degrees</hi> of <hi>Servitude,</hi> and divers <hi>ſorts</hi> of <hi>ſervants.</hi>
Some, as the great Philoſopher in his <hi>Politicks</hi> would have it, are <hi>Servi à
Natura;</hi> 
                     <q>were <hi>framed by Nature only to ſerve,</hi>
                     </q> or to be at other mens diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals,
as not being able to diſpoſe of themſelves. Such as had ſtrong <hi>Bodies</hi>
but weake <hi>Braines</hi> were in his judgment more fit to be governed by Others,
then to govern themſelves. But this kind of <hi>ſervitude</hi> is improper. For
<hi>Omnis ſervus est alicujus Domini Servus; Every Servant is the Servant of ſome
particular Lord or Maſter,</hi> whoſe Intereſt, whether in his Perſon or imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
muſt be grounded upon ſome <hi>Speciall Title.</hi> Such as by Nature are
deſtitute of witt or Reaſon,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Qui ubique eſt, nuſquam eſt;</hi> He that is every where, is no where.</note> do not thereby become <hi>Servants,</hi> unleſſe we
ſhould ſay, they were every mans Servants, that are diſpoſed to imploy
them. And this <hi>Priviledge</hi> they have of others, That they are not capable
of any Contract or Legall Title, by which they may make themſelves, or
<pb n="3043" facs="tcp:100044:34"/>
be made <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That mans ſervants:</hi> And being <hi>no mans ſervants,</hi> they can
be <hi>no ſervants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Though our Engliſh <hi>[Servant]</hi> be derived from the Latin <hi>Servus:</hi>
yet ſervants in our Engliſh tongue we call many, which a good Latiniſt would
rather call <hi>Famuli</hi> then <hi>Servi:</hi> being indeed <hi>Servants,</hi> that is, at other mens
diſpoſals, but in part only, not in whole; whom for Diſtinction ſake we
call <hi>Apprentices</hi> or <hi>Hired Servants:</hi> Over whoſe Actions or Imployments
their Maſters during the time of their hire or <hi>Apprentiſhip,</hi> have full right
and Intereſt; and Authority likewiſe over their Bodies or Perſons, to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
or puniſh them, if they take upon them to diſpoſe of their Actions or
Imployments otherwiſe then for their Maſters Behoof, or as they ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point:
But over their Perſons, their Bodies, their Goods or Children, their
Maſters have no Right nor Intereſt. They may not take upon them by our
Laws to diſpoſe of Theſe, as they do of their Day-Labours or bodily Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments.
Yet are theſe properly called <hi>Servants,</hi> as having made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
ſuch, or are ſo made by their Parents or Guardians, upon ſome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract,
or by ſome <hi>Branch or Title of Commutative Juſtice,</hi> in which there is
alwayes <hi>Ratio dati &amp; accepti,</hi> ſomewhat given and taken, that binds both
the Parties: As in this particular caſe, The <hi>Maſter gives</hi> and the <hi>Servant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives</hi>
meat, drink, and wages; And in Lieu of theſe Benefits received, the
<hi>Servant</hi> yields up, and the Maſter receives a Right or intereſt in his bodily
and daily Labours, and a Power to diſpoſe of theſe. Yet are they <hi>Servants</hi>
(as we ſaid) only <hi>in part,</hi> not <hi>meer ſervants.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Meer Servants</hi> (or <hi>ſervants abſolutely</hi> or in whole) were ſuch as the
Latines called <hi>Mancipia,</hi> ſuch as we call in Engliſh <hi>Slaves</hi> or <hi>Bondmen,</hi> or ſuch
as ſometimes out of a ſuperfluity of ſpeech or expreſſing our ſelves, in our
Native Dialect, we term <hi>Bondſlaves.</hi> For a <hi>Slave</hi> is as much as a <hi>Bondman:</hi> and
no Bondman can be any more then a ſlave. A <hi>Bondſlave</hi> is a Name which hath
no Reality anſwerable or fully commenſurable unto it. Unto this ſtate or
Condition of life, that is, of being a <hi>Slave</hi> or <hi>Bondman,</hi> no man is bound or
ſubject by <hi>Nature;</hi> No Man will willingly or voluntarily ſubject himſelf.
Such as heretofore have been, and in divers Countries yet are, Servants in
this ſenſe, were made ſuch by others from a pretended right or Title of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt,
and were called <hi>Mancipia, quaſi manu Capti,</hi> becauſe they had been
taken in War, and might by rigour of Juſtice, at leaſt by rigour of <hi>Hoſtile
Law,</hi> be put to Death, as men convicted of Rebellion by taking Armes.
Now the price of their Redemption from death, was loſſe of <hi>Civil Liberty</hi>
as well for themſelves as their poſterity. Theſe were truly and properly
called <hi>Servi,</hi> according to the native <hi>Etymologie</hi> of this name in Latin, <hi>Servi
quaſi Servati;</hi> They were again wholly and meerly <hi>Servants,</hi> according to
the utmoſt extent of the Nature, and of the Real Conditions or properties
of Civil <hi>Servitude:</hi> that is, Their Lords or <hi>Maſters</hi> had an <hi>abſolute Right</hi> or
Intereſt not only in their <hi>Bodily Actions</hi> or Imployments, but over their very
<hi>Perſons,</hi> their Bodies, their Children, and whatſoever by any Title did belong
unto them. The Intereſt, Power or Dominion which Maſters by the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil
Law or Law of Nations, had over their <hi>Servi</hi> or <hi>Mancipia,</hi> their <hi>Slaves</hi>
or <hi>Bondmen,</hi> was altogether ſuch, and as abſolute, as a <hi>Free-holder</hi> hath
over his own Inheritance or <hi>Fee ſimple;</hi> that is, a power or Right not only
to reap or take the Annual Fruits or Commodities of it, but full Right to
<hi>Let</hi> or <hi>Sett</hi> for <hi>Term</hi> of years, or to alienate or ſell the Propertie: For ſo
were <hi>Bondmen</hi> and their Children bought and ſold, as Lands and Goods or
Cattle are with us. All the Right, Dominion, or Intereſt which Maſters
<pb n="3044" facs="tcp:100044:35"/>
with us have over their <hi>Servants</hi> or <hi>Apprentices,</hi> is only ſuch as a <hi>Tenant</hi> or
Leaſe-holder for ſome limited time or Terme of years, hath over the ground
or ſoyl which he payeth Rent for: that is, a Right or <hi>Property</hi> in the <hi>Herbage;</hi>
a right or power to reap the Fruits or increaſe of it during the time of his
Covenant, but no right to alienate or ſell ſo much as the <hi>Earth</hi> or <hi>Gravel,</hi>
much leſſe to alienate or make away the <hi>Fee-Simple</hi> or Inheritance, which
is ſtill reſerved unto the Owner. Thus the Bodies or perſons of hired <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>
are their own: Their mindes and Conſciences are <hi>Free,</hi> even during
the time of their <hi>ſervice.</hi> But the Uſe or imployment of their <hi>Bodies in ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices
Lawful</hi> and Ingenuous, is their <hi>Maſters:</hi> So are the <hi>Services</hi> of their
wit, for accompliſhing with care and diligence what by duty they are bound
to perform.</p>

                  <head type="sub">That the former Difference of Servitude or Diſtinction of Servants is ſet
down and allowed by God himſelf.</head>
                  <p>1. THis <hi>Difference</hi> of Servitudes or Diſtinction of <hi>Servants</hi> is expreſly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
in Holy Scripture, allowed and approved of by God himſelf,
<hi>Levit.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">A Paraphraſe upon <hi>Levit. 25, 39, &amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> 25. 39, &amp;c. <hi>If thy Brother that dwelleth by thee, be waxen poor, and be
ſold unto thee, thou ſhalt not compel him to ſerve as a Bond-ſervant. But as an
hired ſervant, and as a Sojourner, he ſhall be with thee, and ſhall ſerve thee,
unto the year of Jubilee. And then ſhall he depart from thee, both he and his
Children with him, and ſhall return unto his own Family, and unto the poſſeſſion
of his Fathers ſhall he return. For they are my Servants which I brought forth
out of the Land of Egypt, they ſhall not be ſold as Bond-men.</hi> From this place
theſe two points are clear: <hi>First,</hi> That if an Iſraelite were waxen poor or
in debt, he might Lawfully ſell or alienate the uſe of his own or of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
bodily imployments unto his Brother, for the maintenance of his and
his Childrens lives, or for the diſcharge of his debt, until the year of <hi>Jubilee,</hi>
but no Longer. But to ſell the bodies or perſons of himſelf or of his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
was not permitted by the Law of God: Nor might any Son of <hi>Abraham</hi>
or <hi>Jacob</hi> buy or ſell any of their Brethren, though willing to ſell themſelves
or their Children. But on the contrary, If through neceſſity, that knows
no Law, any Son of <hi>Jacob</hi> ſold himſelf unto the Heathen: or in caſe he
and his Children had been ſeized upon for debt: his Kinſmen or Brethren
were to redeem him, or at leaſt not to ſuffer him to ſerve any longer then
the year of <hi>Jubilee.</hi> And during that terme he was to ſerve only as a hired
Servant, and not as a Bond-man. From this Law, if they had no other
Reaſon, the Jews here ſpoken of might ſafely plead; <q>That in aſmuch as
they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, they neither were nor could be in bondage unto
any man <hi>de jure..</hi>
                     </q> The reaſon why the Lord would not have them to be
in bondage unto any man, is in the Law expreſſed, <hi>Becauſe they were His Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
by a peculiar Title;</hi> becauſe he had redeemed them from the bondage
and thraldome, unto which the Egyptians had <hi>de Facto,</hi> not <hi>de Jure,</hi> moſt
unjuſtly brought them.</p>
                  <p>2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> from this Law it is clear, That God did both allow and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize
the Iſraelites and ſeed of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to have Bond-men of the Nations
round about them, or of the ſtrangers that ſojourned amongſt them that
they might bequeath the very bodies and perſons of them and their Children,
<pb n="3045" facs="tcp:100044:35"/>
as an inheritance and poſſeſſion unto their Sons and poſterity forever, <hi>ver.</hi> 45,
46. That is, They had the ſame <hi>Title</hi> or intereſt in them; the ſame abſolute
power or <hi>Dominion</hi> over them, as they had over their Lands, their Goods,
or Cattle; that is, power to alienate or ſell them or their Children, for
their beſt commodity at their pleaſure. Of this <hi>ſecond ſort of Servants</hi> or
Bondmen, which were in <hi>Bonis alterius,</hi> the goods or poſſeſſions of their
Maſters, are our Saviours ſpeeches in moſt <hi>Parables</hi> to be underſtood,
wherein mention is made of <hi>Servants</hi> without diſtinction. So we read, <hi>Mat.</hi>
18. 25. <hi>That the Lord of that ungratious Servant, which would not forgive his
Fellow an hundred pence, commanded him to be ſold, and his Wife and Children,
and all that he had, and paiment to be made.</hi> Our <hi>Saviours</hi> ſpeech, though
it be a <hi>Parable</hi> rather then an <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> is grounded upon an Hiſtorical or poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
truth: He ſpeaks according to the common Cuſtome of thoſe times and
places, by which not only the <hi>Servants</hi> themſelves and their Children, but
whatſoever they had gathered together, were wholly at their Lords or
Maſters diſpoſing. For as we ſay, <hi>Superficies ſequitur Solum;</hi> He that is
Lord or owner of the ſoyl or ground becomes thereby Lord and owner of
the Houſe, which another man builds upon it: So in like caſe, He that is
Lord of another mans perſon or body, doth thereby become Lord of all
his goods, or whatſoever he may be thought to poſſeſſe. But ſo it is not
with hired ſervants amongſt us; for in as much as their bodies or perſons are
<hi>Free,</hi> and are no part of their Maſters goods or poſſeſſion, they may be true
Owners, Lords, or Poſſeſſers of whatſoever they got either by their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, or what otherwiſe may fall unto them by deed of Gift, by death of
friends, or the like.</p>
                  <p>3.<note place="margin">Wherein <hi>Bond-men</hi> and Hired <hi>Servants</hi> do in divers points agree.</note> But though Bond-men and hired <hi>Servants</hi> do in other points differ,
yet in many they agree. Moſt <hi>Maxims</hi> whether Legal or Moral, which
are true of the one, are true likewiſe (though in different manner or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion)
of the other. As for Example, When our Saviour ſaith, <hi>No man
can ſerve two Maſters, but he ſhall either love the one or hate the other; or lean
to the one, and deſpiſe the other:</hi> This ſaying in many caſes may be ſpecially
and more remarkably true of <hi>Slaves</hi> or Bond-men; yet very true of hired
<hi>Servants.</hi> For every man is ſo far truly and properly a <hi>Servant,</hi> as he is at
another mans diſpoſal. And every man is ſo far truly and properly a Lord
or Maſter over another man, as he hath right or power to diſpoſe either of
his body or of his actions or Labours. Now in as much as the Maſter of an
hired <hi>Servant</hi> or Apprentiſe hath as abſolute right or intereſt in his Actions,
his Labours, or imployments, as the Maſter of a <hi>Slave</hi> or Bond-man hath in
the actions or imployments of his Bond-man: it is as impoſſible for the One,
as for the other, to execute the will and pleaſure of two men that differ in
their particular imployments or deſigns. It is the duty of a faithful <hi>Servant</hi>
to execute not his own will, but the will and pleaſure of his Maſter. But if
ſo it happen that two Men or more may concur or conſent to imploy One and
the ſame Man in the ſelf ſame buſineſſe and ſervice: then, as we ſay, <hi>Many
ſtones make but one Load;</hi> and many things of ſeveral weight but one bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:
So in this caſe, two or three, or more Men thus concurring in the ſame
deſigns, make but one <hi>Maſter.</hi> But faithfully to execute the wils of men that
differ in their Deſignes, or fully to ſatisfie two or more men that have ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
and ful Intereſts in one mans actions and Labours, is as impoſſible, as for
a body to move two contrary wayes at once.</p>
                  <p>

4. The moſt General and moſt <hi>Eſſential property</hi> wherein both ſorts of
<hi>Servants</hi> do univocally agree,<note place="margin">How Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men or H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>red Servants are differenced from <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi>
                     </note> by which they formally differ from a man ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
<hi>Free,</hi> is thus gathered by <hi>Tully, Liber eſt qui vivit ut vult;</hi> He is Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>villy
Free (for that was the chief <hi>Freedom</hi> that he knew, and the <hi>Freedom</hi>
whereof we now treat) <hi>that may live or do as he will in matters of Civil Paſs or
commerce.</hi> And by Contrary, He is a <hi>Servant,</hi> that in matters Civil, <hi>non
vivit ut vult;</hi> that either cannot do as he would, or ofttimes muſt do as he
would not. Or to give the <hi>very Radical point</hi> of difference betwixt the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi>
and the <hi>Servant,</hi> of what rank ſoever the <hi>Servant</hi> be; we are firſt to
know wherein they agree. Both of them Eſſentially agree in This, in that
they have a reaſonable will or deſire to do themſelves good. For, ſuch as
God hath deprived of the uſe of reaſon, whether by Nature or from their
birth, or by ſubſequent miſchance or Accident, are neither capable of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion
nor <hi>Servitude;</hi> They can neither properly be <hi>Maſters</hi> nor <hi>Servants.</hi>
He that is a <hi>Free-man</hi> or Maſter, in thoſe things wherein he is <hi>Free</hi> or a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
hath not only <hi>Voluntatem propriam,</hi> but <hi>Arbitrium proprium;</hi> not only
a reaſonable Will or deſire to do himſelf good, but with-all a power or
Faculty to diſpoſe of his time, of his Actions or imployments for compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
or attaining the good which he deſires. The <hi>Servant</hi> whileſt he is a
<hi>Servant</hi> hath no <hi>arbitrium proprium,</hi> no Right or power to diſpoſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
or of his actions or labours, for compaſſing or atchieving that good,
which, in that he is a reaſonable Creature, he can as truly affect or deſire as
his Maſter doth. Any Maſter or Man that is <hi>Free,</hi> if at any time he find him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
Melancholy or miſaffected in body or mind, may allot what hour or
hours of the day he pleaſe for the Exerciſe of his body or Recreation of
his mind, and make choice of what company, of what ſport or recreation
he pleaſe; ſo it be Civil and ingenuous, or ſuch as the Law doth either
approve, or not condemn: But this may not a <hi>Servant</hi> do without his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
eſpecial leave or licence. For ſeeing his Maſter hath as good Right or
intereſt in his actions or Labours, as he that payeth rent for grounds, or hire
for an Horſe, hath in the uſe of both, during the times of their hire: It is a
branch of the ſame fraud or Couzenage in a <hi>Servant,</hi> either to alienate or
convert his Actions or Labours to any other end then to his Maſters behoof,
as it is in a man that takes money of Another for his Lands or Grounds, and
yet will reap part of their annual fruits or commodities; The ſame offence
in a <hi>Servant</hi> to miſpend that time in play, ſport, or idleneſſe which ſhould
be ſpent in his Maſters imployments, as for a man to take intereſt for money
lent, and not ſuffer the Party to enjoy it wholly during the time for which he
paid intereſt.</p>
                  <p>5. <hi>Again,</hi> An hired <hi>Servant</hi> may as truly and lawfully deſire to encreaſe
that power, ſtock, or means which he hath either gotten by his ſervice, or
hath been left him by his Friends; as his Maſter in like caſe may do. But
he may not uſe; it is unlawful for him to uſe the ſame means for encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his portion, that his Maſter may do. For <hi>Firſt,</hi> He cannot without
wrong to his Maſter take ſo much time for <hi>contriving</hi> his own profit or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity,
as his maſter without wrong to any man, may do. Or <hi>Secondly,</hi>
Though he had time enough to contrive his ends: yet can he not without
wrong to his Maſter have time enough or take liberty to <hi>practiſe</hi> the means
for effecting or accompliſhing what he hath contrived: As he may not
without his Maſters leave frequent Markets or meeting, where gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
bargaines or opportunities of increaſing his meanes are to be
had.</p>

6. <hi>Againe,</hi> It is Lawfull and honeſt for a <hi>Servant</hi> to <hi>wiſh well</hi> unto his
friends; or to be <hi>willing</hi> to do them good, that have done him any; But it
is not ſo <hi>Free</hi> or lawfull for him to <hi>imploy</hi> himſelf, his time, or Labours to
do them any reall good or friendly office, as it is in like caſe for his Maſter.
Nay a <hi>Servant</hi> in this caſe ſhall oft be conſtrained to beſtow his paines for
their good, whom he leaſt affects; and to neglect, or to do nothing for
them, to whom he wiſhes moſt good; whom he loves beſt. For all his
Actions or imployments are at the diſpoſall of his Maſter, who if he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
him to do ſome buſineſſe for his own enemy, but his Maſters Friend,
though to the prejudice of his own Friend, but his Maſters Enemy; (unleſſe
the action be unjuſt, or by the publique law forbidden,) He muſt do his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
Will, not his Own. Nor would any Ingenuous man like worſe a <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi>
in thus doing, but rather the better. So that every <hi>Servant</hi> hath a <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Will</hi> to deſire that which is good for himſelf or to his friend; but hath
oft-times a <hi>Neceſsitie</hi> laid upon him, <hi>aut non agendi quod vult, aut agendi quod
non vult,</hi> either of not doing that which he moſt deſires to do, or of doing

not unto ordinary Hearers only, but unto many good Interpreters ſeeme

                  </p>
                  <p>2. Now as it cannot be denied that this name of <hi>Servitude</hi> is (as wee ſay)
<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a <hi>Terme</hi> that may be properly attributed in different meaſure to
many ſubjects of diverſe natures or Conditions: So the <hi>prime</hi> and principall
<hi>ſubject</hi> of it, unto which it agrees in moſt exquiſite and ample manner, is,
not the Legall or Civill <hi>Servitude</hi> whereof we have hitherto treated, but the
<hi>Servitude of Sin</hi> Whereof our Saviour here ſpeakes. Whence although we
ſtand bound to believe the truth of this Concluſion from his Authority
alone; yet this no way barres us from Searching other reaſons or <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi>
whether from <hi>Art</hi> or <hi>Nature,</hi> for illuſtration of this truth, or for
confirmation of our Belief or knowledge of it. Or rather, His <hi>Emphaticall</hi>
manner of averring it, ought to incite us to <hi>ſound</hi> the meaning of it a little
deeper, and to diſcover the reaſon of it to the bottome. And thus doing
we ſhall but follow the ſtepps of two of our Sauiours Apoſtles S. <hi>Peter</hi> and
S. <hi>Paul,</hi> in this very particular. Both of them having occaſion to uſe the
ſame <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> that our Saviour here doth, give us the reaſon of the truth
or property of this <hi>Aſſertion.</hi> So ſaith S. <hi>Paul.</hi> to the Romans, Cap. 6. 16.
<hi>Know ye not</hi> (as if it were matter of groſs ignorance or imputation, not to
know) <hi>that to whom Ye yield your ſelves ſervants to obey, his Servants ye are to
whom ye obey: Whether it be of ſin unto death, or of obedience unto righteouſneſſe.</hi>
So that there is a proper <hi>Servitude</hi> in yielding unto Sin: And whoſoever
yields his conſent or obedience unto Sin, doth thereby make himſelf the
true and proper <hi>Servant</hi> of Sin.</p>
                  <p>3. And S. <hi>Peter.</hi> 2. Epiſtle. 2. Chap. having ſharply taxed ſuch <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall
Goſpellers</hi> as had forſaken the right way and followed the way of <hi>Balaam,</hi>
which Loved the wayes of unrighteouſneſſe, brands them with this note
or Character, <hi>That whileſt they promiſe Liberty unto others, they themſelves are
the Servants of Corruption.</hi> And this Aſſertion he ratifies by this reaſon or
Doctrinall Principle, <hi>Of whom a man is overcome, Of the ſame he is brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Bondage.</hi> This reaſon toucheth the very root of <hi>Bondage</hi> or <hi>Servitude</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
ſo called, which had no other Title to its <hi>Firſt Being</hi> or introduction
into the World, beſides the right or title of victorie or Conqueſt. Now to
be ſubdued or vanquiſhed againſt their Wills, though in a doubtfull or bad
Cauſe, is not ſo meritorious of ſlavery or bondage, as to ſuffer our ſelves
through our ſloath, through our Cowardize, our ſupine negligence, or
treachery to be overcome in a true, a juſt, a neceſſary, eſpecially in a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious
Cauſe. He to whom men yield themſelves <hi>Servants</hi> by betraying or
not defending ſuch Cauſes; though he love the <hi>Treaſon</hi> whereby he gaines
the victory, will uſe the <hi>Traytor</hi> or Partie vanquiſhed by him, but as a <hi>ſlave</hi>
or Bondman.</p>
                  <p>4. The Firſt and <hi>Radicall Point</hi> of difference betwixt a <hi>Servant</hi> and a <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
in matters civill, was before ſet down, and it was this: A man that is
Civilly <hi>Free</hi> hath not only <hi>Voluntatem propriam,</hi> a reaſonable will to deſire
his own good, or a <hi>Freedome</hi> of conſultation to contrive the meanes how this
good may be attained; but withall a <hi>Right</hi> or power to diſpoſe of himſelf,
<pb n="3049" facs="tcp:100044:37"/>
of his time, of his bodily Actions or imployments for executing his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Conſultations. The <hi>Servant</hi> hath the like Reaſonable <hi>Will</hi> to deſire
his own good; a Naturall <hi>Power</hi> or Faculty to deliberate or conſult by what
meanes the good which he requires may be attained; but no <hi>Right</hi> or power
to diſpoſe of himſelf, of his time, of his bodily Labours, of his actions or
imployments for executing his deſires, or deliberations; for in all theſe he
is at his Maſters diſpoſall. Now the want of this power or liberty to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeute
their own contrivances, makes <hi>Servants</hi> for the moſt part more ſlow
and more dull in their deſires, and more unapt to contrive the meanes for
compaſſing what they deſire.</p>
                  <p>5. From this Difference between <hi>Servitude</hi> and <hi>Freedome</hi> or Servants and
Freemen in matters Civill and Politick,<note place="margin">The meaſure of tranſgreſſion of the Law of God, the only true meaſure of <hi>Servitude.</hi>
                     </note> it is but a ſhort Cut and eaſie paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age,
to diſcover the right Difference betwixt <hi>Servitude,</hi> and <hi>Freedome,</hi> in
matters morall and ſacred. <hi>Sin</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>is the tranſgreſſion
of the Law.</hi> And every Tranſgreſſor of the Law, to wit, of the morall
Law of God; that is, Every ſuch Tranſgreſſor, as we call <hi>Malefactor</hi> or
<hi>Offender;</hi> Every one that delights in tranſgreſſion or hath no power to reſiſt
temptations to tranſgreſſe, is truely and properly the <hi>Servant of ſin. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum</hi>
(ſaith the Philoſopher) <hi>eſt menſura ſui &amp; obliqui: Aright Line is the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of that which is crooked as well as of that which is straight.</hi> Now the right
Line or <hi>Rule</hi> by which as well our deſires as our Actions muſt be framed, by
which the Obliquities of both muſt be diſcovered or cenſured, is the Morall
<hi>Law</hi> of God. This is the only <hi>Rule</hi> by which the height or degrees as well
of our <hi>Freedome</hi> as our <hi>Servitude,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Wherein the beſt of the Heathens did erre, as well in their Definiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Libertie as of Happines.</note> muſt be meaſured. For want of this <hi>Rule</hi>
to direct them, the wiſeſt among the Heathens have either much erred in the
Definition of Liberty or <hi>Freedome,</hi> or at leaſt come farr ſhort of the truth in
defining it. <hi>Quid eſt Libertas niſ ipoteſtas vivendiut velis? what is liberty or free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome</hi>
(ſaith<note place="margin">In Paradoxis.</note> Tully) <hi>but a Power or Facultie of living as we would?</hi> But this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition
or deſcription of Liberty or <hi>Freedome</hi> is very defective and Lame,
like a Sentence without the Principall Verbe, or a Body without a Soule.
Mans Will in the ſtate of corruption or ſince <hi>Adams</hi> Fall, is no competent
<hi>Rule</hi> for Humane Actions: It ſelf muſt be regulated by the Law of God,
whether poſitive or Eternall. The very life and ſpirit of perfect <hi>Liberty,</hi> in
whomſoever,<note place="margin">☜</note> is, <hi>Poteſtas volendi quod lex divina jubet,</hi> that is, <hi>a Power or
Faculty of willing that, which by Gods Law we ought to will.</hi> And this power or
faculty being ſuppoſed as the <hi>Soul: Poteſtas vivendi aut agendi quod volumus,</hi>
that other <hi>power,</hi> which <hi>Tully</hi> only mentions, <hi>of Living or doing as we will or
deſire,</hi> is but the <hi>Bodie</hi> of true <hi>Freedome</hi> or Liberty. So that he only is a true
and perfect <hi>Freeman,</hi> that hath both the <hi>Body and Soul</hi> of perfect <hi>Freedome:</hi>
that is, <hi>tampoteſtatem volendi quod deceat, quam vivendi ut vult,</hi> as true a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
to will what he ought, as to do what he will. <hi>So much as a man hath of this
Freedome, ſo much and no more he hath of true Happineſſe.</hi> Some <hi>Philoſophers</hi>
there were, which defined <hi>Happineſſe</hi> after the ſame manner that <hi>Tullie</hi> defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<hi>Libertie. Him they accounted</hi> Happie <hi>which lived according to his own Will.</hi>
But <hi>God forbid</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> Epiſt. 121. <hi>ad Probam,) that we ſhould take
this for Goſpel. Quid ſi enim nequiter velit vivere? for what ſhall We think if a
man were diſpoſed to Live wickedly</hi> or <hi>naughttly?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Auguſt. Epiſt. 121.</note> Nonne tantò miſerior eſſe convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citur,
quantò facilius mala ejus Volunt as impletur? May be not hence be convinced
to be ſo much the more miſerable, by how much it is more eaſie for him to accompliſh
his naughty will? And therefore this Opinion (as the ſame Father avoucheth)
was rejected by ſuch <hi>Philoſophers</hi> or wiſe-men, as were without knowledge
of the only wiſe immortall God. For, One of thoſe <hi>Philoſophers</hi> or <hi>wiſe
<pb n="3050" facs="tcp:100044:38"/>
men</hi> (ſaith the ſame Father) <hi>Vir Eloquentiſſimus</hi> (whether he meant <hi>Cicero</hi>
or <hi>Seneca,</hi> or ſome other I know not) condemns the former Opinion as an
<hi>Hereſie</hi> in Philoſophie, and gives this Reaſon for it; <hi>Velle enim quod non dece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at,
idipſum miſerrimum: Nec tam miſerum eſt, non adipiſci quod velis, quàm
adipſcivelle, quod non oporteat: To will that which a man ought not to will, is
the greateſt miſery that can befall a man: Nor is it ſo great a miſery not to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chieve
what we deſire, as to deſire to atchieve, or endeavour to compaſs that, which
we ought not to deſire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Quid tibi videntur haec verba, <hi>(ſaith the ſame Father unto his Friend to
whom he wrote this Epiſtle)</hi> nonne ab ipſâ veritate per quemlibet homin e<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> dicta
ſunt? What, do you think, were not theſe words derived from the Fountain of
Truth, by what Conduit or channel ſoever they have been brought unto us?
<hi>Therefore we may ſay of this</hi> Saying, <hi>as S.</hi> Paul <hi>doth of a Prophet or</hi> Poet
<hi>of</hi> Creet, <hi>whoſe ſentence did pleaſe him,</hi> Teſtimonium hoc verum eſt, this Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony
is true, <hi>and worthy the receiving. And from this ſaying that</hi> Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend
Father <hi>concludes,</hi> Ille igitur beatus eſt, qui omnia que vult habet, nec
aliquid vult quod non decet; He is truly happy that hath all things which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
to have, being diſpoſed to deſire nothing which he ought not. <hi>This Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
is as neceſſarie and true in the Argument whereof we treat:</hi> He only is
a true and perfect Free-man, which hath a power or Freedom to deſire nothing
but what be ought, and a power or Freedom to diſpoſe of himſelf, and of his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours,
for attaining or compaſſing what he thus deſires. <hi>So that</hi> this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
conſiſts in the ſervice of God: <hi>And that conſiſts in a ſubmiſſion to his Will,
and in reliance upon his moſt abſolute Power to accompliſh whatſoever
he will, or whatſoever He ſhall think fitting for us to will or deſire at his
hands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. As abſolute <hi>Happineſs;</hi> So abſolute <hi>Freedom</hi> is only in God. <hi>Both</hi> are
Eſſential only unto him: that is; He only cannot be deprived either of
<hi>Happineſs</hi> or of <hi>Freedom,</hi> by any other: Nor can he be willing to deprive
himſelf of them. <hi>Non Deus volens iniquitatem Tu es,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi>
5. <hi>Thou art not a God, that canſt will iniquity,</hi> as the Gods of the Heathen did.
It is as impoſſible for our God to make ſuch Laws, or to grant ſuch diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
with his own Laws, as the God of <hi>Rome</hi> and Roman Catholicks, the
Pope doth; as it is for this God of <hi>Rome,</hi> to make himſelf the God of Heaven.
He cannot diſpenſe with the Law forbidding marriage betwixt Uncle and
Niece: He cannot make Laws to authorize murther. It is the <hi>Firſt</hi> Part of his
happineſſe, to be able to Will only that which is Good, Juſt, and Holy: the
<hi>Second,</hi> in that he hath abſolute power to do whatſoever he will in heaven
and earth.</p>
                  <p>8. Men and Angels in their firſt Creation had a true image of this their
Creators Happineſſe and <hi>Freedom.</hi> And this image of their <hi>Freedom</hi> did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in a power or facultie of <hi>Willing</hi> only ſuch things as were good and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
to their Creator: Secondly, in a power or facultie of <hi>Framing</hi> their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
deſires or appetities of Senſe, &amp; of ſquaring all their actions and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
acording to the rectitude or Rule of their Reaſonable will. But this
<hi>Power</hi> or facultie, wherewith both Men and Angels at their firſt Creation
were endued, was in reſpect of <hi>both</hi> its <hi>objects</hi> or branches, as well in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of <hi>willing</hi> only that which was <hi>Good,</hi> as of their <hi>ability to do what they
would,</hi> mutable or <hi>contingent:</hi> It was not Eſſential to them, as to God.
Though Man by Right of Creation was truly <hi>Free:</hi> Yet he had a true poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of loſing his <hi>Freedom;</hi> a greater poſſibility of ceaſing to be a <hi>Freeman,</hi>
then of ceaſing to be a <hi>man.</hi> As he was created after Gods image, he was
<pb n="3051" facs="tcp:100044:38"/>
actually and truly indued with <hi>Freedom:</hi> But as he was a man created of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
he was capable of <hi>Servitude:</hi> And by his folly or wilful preſumption
he brought himſelf and his poſterity into <hi>Bondage</hi> unto Satan? Who by the
like but greater preſumption and more wilful abuſe of his <hi>Free-will</hi> or power
over himſelf, did bring himſelf and his Confederate Angels into greater and
more deſperate <hi>Servitude</hi> unto ſin and wickedneſſe, then he could draw our
firſt Parents unto; albeit he drew them into true and proper <hi>Servitude,</hi> and
to this day draws all ſuch as ſeek not <hi>to be ſet Free by Chriſt in this acceptable
time which is allotted here on Earth,</hi> into abſolute, compleat, and deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
<hi>Servitude;</hi> into ſuch an irrecoverable eſtate as he and his Angels

                  <head type="sub">of the ſeveral branches of Servitude unto ſin.</head>
                  <p>1. THe principal <hi>Branches</hi> or ſtems of this our <hi>Servitude</hi> unto Sin, are <hi>Four.</hi>
The <hi>First,</hi> an <hi>Impotency</hi> or want of power of doing that which we
would, or a neceſſitie of not doing that which Reaſon and our own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
tels us to be Good,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>The degrees or Latitude of the</hi> Firſt, Second, Third, and Fourth <hi>Branches of</hi> Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude <hi>unto ſin.</hi>
                     </note> or that which the word of God expreſly requires at
our hands, as a due Service unto our Creator and Redeemer. The degrees
or <hi>Latitude of this branch</hi> muſt be taken from the neceſſity of the duty or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
Commanding obedience, and from the degrees of our impotency
or want of ability to do what is commanded, which ſometimes grows into
a Neceſſity of Non-performance. The <hi>Second</hi> branch of our <hi>Servitude</hi>
conſiſts in a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of doing what we would not: that is, of doing that in
the <hi>Particular,</hi> which we utterly diſlike in the <hi>General,</hi> as being contrary
to the Rule of Reaſon, or to the dictate of our Conſciences in our ſober and
ret<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>red thoughts, or contrary to the expreſſe word of God, which ought
to be the Rule as well of our Actions as of our Wils and deſires. Of theſe
two branches of Servitude is that of the Apoſtle, <hi>Rom. 7. 14, 15. For we
know that the Law is ſpiritual: but I am Carnal, ſold under Sin. For that which
I do, I allow not: for what I would, that do I not; but what I hate, that do I.</hi>
And verſ. 19. <hi>For the good that I would, I do not: but the evil which I would
not, that do I.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>Third branch</hi> of this <hi>ſervitude</hi> unto ſin conſiſts in an <hi>Impotency</hi> or
want of ability to will or deſire thoſe things which we ought to deſire. The
<hi>Root</hi> of this branch is <hi>Ignorance,</hi> either of thoſe good things which may be
known by natural light of Reaſon, or by the word of God. Of this <hi>branch
of ſervitude,</hi> or of <hi>Servants</hi> of this rank or Condition, is that of the Apoſtle
eſpecially true and intended by him,<note place="margin">Eph. 4. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>That they have their minds darkened,
and the eyes of their underſtanding blinded, through the ignorance that is in
them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>Fourth</hi> and laſt <hi>Branch,</hi> which is likewiſe the worſt, conſiſts in
a <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of Willing and deſiring that which we ought not to deſire or will.
Againſt this branch of <hi>Servitude,</hi> or men thus affected, is that <hi>Woe</hi> of the
Prophet in particular denounced; <hi>Eſay 5. 20. We unto them that call evil good,
and good evil, that put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs, that put bitter
for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter.</hi> Of this <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Fourth Branch</hi> is that of the
Apoſtle, <hi>Eph. 4. 19. Who being paſt feeling, have given themſelves over unto
Laſciviouſneſs, to work all uncleanneſs with greedineſs.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="3052" facs="tcp:100044:39"/>
4. The <hi>Third Branch,</hi> or Impotency of willing that which we ought, or
that which we are in duty bound, not only to will, but to do, is ſuch an <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity</hi>
of the Soul, as we ſee in ſome mens bodies, which have loſt not only
their <hi>digeſtive Faculty,</hi> but all appetite of wholeſome <hi>Food.</hi> This <hi>Fourth</hi>
and laſt <hi>Branch,</hi> which conſiſts in a <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of willing that which we ought
not to will, is like to that diſtemper of body which Phyſitians call the <hi>Pica</hi>

                  <p>5.<note place="margin">Theſe Branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Servitude unto ſin either natural or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</note> All theſe <hi>Branches</hi> of <hi>Servitude,</hi> but eſpecially the <hi>First</hi> and the <hi>Third,</hi>
are <hi>Two-fold;</hi> either <hi>Natural</hi> or <hi>Acquired.</hi> Or to ſpeak more properly;
The <hi>Roots</hi> and <hi>Firſt ſeeds</hi> of them are natural and hereditary from our firſt
Parents: The <hi>Nutriment,</hi> the <hi>Growth</hi> or increaſe of them is for the moſt part
from men themſelves, not from <hi>Adam:</hi> Theſe are acquired or purchaſed
by ill Education or breeding,<note place="margin">☜</note> by lewd Company or bad Cuſtomes. Never
was there any ſon of <hi>Adam</hi> but upon Examination might have found himſelf
oft-times indiſpoſed, unapt, or altogether unable, to do many things which
in the <hi>General</hi> he approved as <hi>Good,</hi> &amp; in his retured thoughts he deſired to do;
and for the not doing of which, when opportunity ſerved, and occaſions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
his wakened Conſcience or After-thoughts would often check him,
Never was there any ſon of <hi>Adam,</hi> whoſe Conſcience upon a review or Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
of his Actions, would not accuſe or condemn him for doing many
things, which in better Mood he deſired not to do, and ſuch things as he
had promiſed to himſelf and his own Conſcience, if not to others, not
to do.</p>
                  <p>6. But this <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of doing many things which in their ſober mood they
reſolve not to do,<note place="margin">☜</note> or of doing them in ſuch a high meaſure and degree as oft-times
they are done, is not <hi>Hereditary</hi> to any Son of <hi>Adam.</hi> This is a <hi>neceſſity</hi>
which men bring upon themſelves, either by frequenting Lewd Company,
or by bad Cuſtome, or at leaſt have it brought upon them, not by <hi>Adam,</hi>
but by the bad example or ill inſtructions of their immediate Parents or O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeers.
As for the <hi>Fourth Branch of Servitude,</hi> which conſiſts in a <hi>Neceſſity</hi> of
willing or deſiring thoſe things which men ought not to deſire; this of all the
reſt is leaſt <hi>hereditary:</hi> For it includes a degree of <hi>Iniquity</hi> with which we
cannot charge our Father <hi>Adam.</hi> He indeed ſought to mince or miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
his offence after he had wilfully committed it; and thus to do was a
grievous fault or offence: But we never read, nor have we any reaſon to
ſuſpect, that he did delight or glory, either in this or in any other Sin; or
uſe his ſins paſt as an advantage or <hi>Riſe</hi> to mount himſelf to Sin<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> We do
not read that <hi>Cain</hi> did glory in the murther of his Brother <hi>Abel;</hi> or that <hi>Judas</hi>
did make himſelf merry with the price of bloud: Both of them were <hi>ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi>
unto Sin, and by ſin unto Satan. Their <hi>Servitude</hi> unto ſin in general
was hereditarie, and neceſſarily derived unto them, as it is naturally unto
all us, from our father <hi>Adam.</hi> But neither was the One a <hi>Murtherer</hi> or Fratri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide,
nor the other a <hi>Traytor,</hi> by <hi>natural d ſcent</hi> or inheritance. <hi>Judas</hi> became
a <hi>Traytor</hi> by making himſelf as baſe a <hi>Servant</hi> or vaſſal to Covetouſneſſe; yet
not ſo great a ſervant to the one or other Sin as thoſe which delight and glory
in theſe or the like Sins. For though the <hi>Scripture hath concluded all under ſin,</hi>
as well the Jew as the Gentile; Though the beſt of men, as the Scripture
teacheth us, be by <hi>Nature</hi> the <hi>Servants</hi> of ſin: yet we read of ſome whom
the Scripture hath branded with this mark, <hi>that they have ſold themſelves to
work wickedneſs or do miſchief.</hi> And theſe are <hi>ſlaves</hi> to Sin, and Bond-men
unto Satan by a double <hi>Title;</hi> the <hi>One</hi> by <hi>natural deſcent</hi> or inheritance; the
<pb n="3053" facs="tcp:100044:39"/>
                     <hi>Other</hi> by their own <hi>voluntary Acts,</hi> as it were of bargain or Sale. <hi>Cain</hi> and
theſe Jews mentioned, <hi>John</hi> 8. which perſecuted our Saviour, becauſe his
works were Good and theirs were evil, were not only the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi>
(though that were enough to make them <hi>Servants</hi> of Sin;) but as our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
tels them in the 44. verſe of that 8. Chapter, <hi>They were of their Father
the Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. But to deſcend unto a more particular ſurvey of <hi>Every Branch,</hi> begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
with the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second</hi> which are for the moſt part coincident, and ſo
mutually wrapt together, that we cannot truly handle the one but we muſt
touch the other. For, The <hi>First</hi> (as hath been ſaid before) conſiſts in an
<hi>impotencie</hi> or impoſſibility of doing that which we oft-times deſire to doe,
and approve as good. And this impotency or impoſſibility doth ordinarily
proceed from, or draw after it a <hi>neceſſitie</hi> of doing that which we deſtire not
to do, and which in our better thoughts we altogether condemn as naughty,
and unfitting to be done.</p>
                  <p>8. Some meaſure of theſe <hi>Branches</hi> was clearly diſcovered by the wiſer
and more ſober ſort of the <hi>Heathen.</hi>

alſo were equally ſubject to the like baſe conditions or lewd diſpoſtion of

and affections, whether in Bondmen or in their Maſters, was adjudged
by the very <hi>Heathen</hi> to be more baſe and <hi>ſervile,</hi> then the Legall eſtate or
condition of known <hi>Slaves</hi> or Bondmen.<note place="margin">☜</note> But before I acquaint the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with the opinions of Heathens in this point, I muſt requeſt him not to
miſtake my meaning or intention, as if I eſteemed the <hi>Verdict</hi> or <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of
the beſt <hi>Philoſophers</hi> amongſt them, to be in themſelves of any credit or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
in matters ſacred, in myſteries of Faith or Divinitie. I would rather
requeſt him to conſider with me; That many teſtimonies, which are of no
credit in themſelves, nor can borrow any authoritie from their Authors,
may be notwithſtanding of very good uſe for the confirmation of better Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie,
or for the diſcovering or bolting out the truth: whoſe Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
by what meanes ſoever once diſcovered, or from whom ſoever it do pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
is alwaies great and ought to prevaile, as in the end it certainely will
prevail againſt ignorance and error, in whomſoever they be found, though
patronized by men, otherwiſe of extraordinary parts, and deſerved autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
For example, The teſtimony of a known Lyar, whoſe Oath we
would not take for <hi>ſix pence,</hi> is good and lawful againſt himſelf. A notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Thief or Malefactors own confeſſion, eſpecially if it be deliberately
made, and judicially taken, is a Conviction as ſufficient and Authentick, as
the depoſitions of two, or three, or more, moſt honeſt men. Now the
ſame Law or reaſon of the Law, which in ſome caſes admits the teſtimony
or confeſſions of diſhoneſt men for legal proof, will warrant us to admit the
opinions, but eſpecially the reaſons of <hi>Ancient Heathens,</hi> which never knew
the true God, nor Jeſus Chriſt whom he had ſent, for ſufficient and Authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick
Teſtimonies to convince the <hi>Athieſts</hi> of later times, or ſuch as live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
God in this preſent world, or ſuch amongſt us, as having much better
means then the beſt of the <hi>Heathen</hi> had, to know God and his Chriſt,
yet live altogether without any true fear or love of Either, and in as little
<pb n="3054" facs="tcp:100044:40"/>
ſenſe or feeling of their own natural <hi>Servitude</hi> or preſent bondage unto ſin, as
the rudeſt or worſt ſort of <hi>Heathen</hi> did.</p>
                  <p>9. Yet further; Albeit the wiſeſt and beſt ſort of Heathen Philoſophers
lived in <hi>Bondage</hi> unto Sin, and died <hi>Servants</hi> of corruption: yet did they not
alwayes ſpeak out of the corruption wherewith their very Souls were taint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Many things they ſpake and wrote out of the Law of nature <hi>written</hi> (as
our Apoſtle teſtifieth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 15.) <hi>in their hearts.</hi> By the Light of which
<hi>Law likewiſe,</hi> they did many things contained in the <hi>written Law</hi> of God:
For, not having <hi>that Law,</hi> as the Apoſtle there ſaith, <hi>they were a law unto
themſelves.</hi> Now as the teſtimony or confeſſion of a notorious Malefactor
voluntarily and judicially made againſt himſelf, is ſuffcient to condemn that
Judge or Juror, of injuſtice or partiality, that would not take it for a legal
proof or conviction: ſo ſhall the Allegations or collections of the <hi>Heathens,</hi>
which were themſelves Servants unto ſin, be of Authority enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn
us of a worſe crime, unleſſe upon their informations we make more
particular and exact enquirie; <hi>Firſt,</hi> into the <hi>ſervile Eſtate</hi> or Condition

ſometimes not ſo much as <hi>one Ring</hi> upon either hand, nor obſerving any

great Senators or Noble-mans Houſe in a Robe befitting his calling, would

Scurrilous Companion by profeſſion, who was ſo delighted in this accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
trade of Life, that after the Gout had ſo hammered and bemaul'd his
joynts, that he could not ſo much as finger a Pair of Dice, did hire a Slave
to take them up and throw them for him. This man, in this <hi>Slaves</hi> opinion,
was ſo much leſſe wretched or baſe then the former <hi>Gentleman Priſcus,</hi> by
how much he was more uniform to himſelf, and more conſtant in his
wonted courſe of Life; whereas the other was perpetually toſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
contrary inclinations, as if he had been ſometimes ſo hard tied
that he could not but ſtand upright; oftner let Looſe, to fall foul or
groveling.</p>
                  <p>5. The <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> or iſſue of this ſawcy <hi>Theſis</hi> or Generality was this;
That the <hi>Gentleman Priſcus</hi> did repreſent his Lord and <hi>Maſter,</hi> as <hi>Volanerius</hi>
did <hi>Davus</hi> himſelf; who by his own acknowledgement was conſtantly addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
to one or two of his Maſters bad qualities, vet a <hi>Servant</hi> but to one Lord
beſides his Bellie; Whereas his Maſter had ſubjected himſelf to many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruly
<hi>Appetites</hi> and enormous deſires, all contrary to the <hi>Dictates</hi> of his
own Reaſon or <hi>Conſcience</hi> in his more private and retired thoughts. So
much of the <hi>Law of Reaſon</hi> and of <hi>Nature</hi> was implanted in this his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
that he could highly commend the manners and practiſes of the
<hi>Ancient Romans:</hi> And yet if any good ſpirit did invite or move him
to follow their example, he was as ready to kick at the motion or the
practiſe in <hi>Particular,</hi> as he had been to commend the pattern ſet him,
by the <hi>Ancient Romans,</hi> conſidered only in the <hi>General.</hi> Being not invited
by his betters abroad, a moderate homely diſh of broath, of herbs, &amp;c,
was moſt applauded by him; and his family free from moleſtation. But if
<hi>Mecaenas</hi> or any other great <hi>Potentate</hi> had upon ſhort warning invited him to
ſupper, he inſtantly declared himſelf to be a <hi>Slave</hi> both to his <hi>Belly</hi> and to
his <hi>Superiors;</hi> and a <hi>Tyrant</hi> withal to his <hi>Servants;</hi> chiding one for not
bringing him <hi>Oyl;</hi> beating another for not bringing him <hi>water</hi> or other pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratives,
with more ſpeed then could in reaſon be expected. From theſe
and the like Inductions <hi>Davus</hi> concludes his <hi>Maſter</hi> to be more then a Slave

                  <p>1. BUt what did it boot this <hi>Satyriſt</hi> to know all this, or to mark the
moſt of the Romans his Country-men to be indeed true Servants?<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Tully</hi> both true <hi>Servants,</hi> though they knew not tò whom.</note>
                     <hi>He himſelf laid nothing of all this to Heart.</hi> The beſt uſe we can in
diſcretion preſume to be made of this Obſervation, was to make himſelf and
Others merry; ſetting down his obſervations by way of Play or Enterlude.
He lived, and for ought we know, dyed an <hi>Epicure,</hi> not in <hi>Practiſe</hi> only, but
in <hi>Opinion;</hi> One that accounted it the greateſt part of miſery or <hi>Servitude,</hi>
to be wedded to one kind of Bodily Pleaſure, or carnal delight. And the
greateſt <hi>Happineſs</hi> he aimed at, was to be <hi>Free</hi> to taſte and try all kind of <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,</hi>
ſo far as they were not hurtful unto his body.</p>
                  <p>2. As for <hi>Tully,</hi> though he handled his matters a great deal more gravely
and ſoberly, and were much better in Opinion: Yet in the iſſue of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
He ſeems rather to change his <hi>Maſter,</hi> then any way to ſet himſelf
<hi>Free.</hi> He was not indeed ſuch a <hi>Servant</hi> to his own Imagination or Fancy,
not ſuch a <hi>Servant</hi> to Covetouſneſſe, to Luſt, perhaps not to Ambition
or Superiority of dominion, as He obſerved the moſt other Romans to be:
Yet he was a greater <hi>Servant</hi> to <hi>His Owne Will,</hi> then others were to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
deſires. His very <hi>Will</hi> it ſelf was in <hi>Servitude,</hi> as having no Rule
to rectifie it, unleſſe it were the <hi>Romane Lawes</hi> which though in many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
they were Good: yet Such as were too much addicted unto the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
Frame of them, Or Such as gloried in the wiſdome or Excellencie of
them, were brought unwittingly to exerciſe Enmitie againſt God, and
his <hi>Annoynted Christ.</hi> Such as the <hi>Romanes</hi> accounted their <hi>Godliest
Patriots</hi> or Common-wealths-men, were alwayes the <hi>Greateſt Enemies</hi>
unto the <hi>Jewes</hi> or Profeſſors of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law before our Saviours time, as
unto the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> after our Saviours death. God in his juſt Judgements
did ſend them ſuch cruell Kings as <hi>Tiberius,</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> becauſe they were
ſo cruelly bent againſt the <hi>Profeſſors of his Goſpel.</hi> What could it advantage
theſe or any other <hi>Heathens</hi> to know themſelves to be in <hi>Servitude,</hi> not
knowing unto whom they were in <hi>Servitude,</hi> or whoſe <hi>Servants</hi> they were
<hi>de Facto,</hi> nor by whom they were to be made <hi>Free?</hi> Some good <hi>Notions</hi> they
had of <hi>vice</hi> or of Sin: But of <hi>Satan</hi> or his wicked Angels they had not ſo
much as heard; or at leaſt what they had heard of them, they accounted
but <hi>Toyes</hi> or Fables. And that which was the Root of their miſery, and
ſtrongeſt bond of their <hi>Slavery</hi> was, that they worſhipped <hi>Friends or Devils,</hi>
as if in their opinion they had been Gods, becauſe able to do them bodily
harm or bodily good. Now <hi>in offering Sacrifices</hi> (as our Apoſtle ſaith)
unto <hi>Devils,</hi> they did ſolemnly and publikely profeſſe them to be their <hi>Lords
and Maſters.</hi> So that they were not only profeſſed <hi>Servants unto Sin,</hi> but
profeſſed <hi>Servants unto Satan.</hi> In worſhipping them and doing them <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi>
they did that which was worthy of ſtripes; and were to be beaten,
yet with fewer ſtripes then the wicked <hi>Jew,</hi> or ſuch as confeſſe Chriſt to be
their Lord, and yet will not learn to deny ungodlineſſe. For theſe <hi>Heathens</hi>
did not know, that they had ſuch a <hi>Lord or Maſter,</hi> whom they were bound
to <hi>ſerve:</hi> And not knowing him to be their <hi>Maſter;</hi> how was it poſſible that
they ſhould know his <hi>will?</hi> But we acknowledge him to be <hi>Our Lord;</hi> We

<pb n="3060" facs="tcp:100044:43"/>
the <hi>works of Satan.</hi> Now <hi>if we ſhall labour to build up that which He
came to deſtroy:</hi> we ſhall prove our ſelves not only to be <hi>ſervants to ſin,</hi>
and by Sin <hi>Servants</hi> unto Satan; but profeſſed <hi>Enemies</hi> and <hi>Traytors</hi> unto

offer ſacrifice and do ſolemn ſervice unto Satan and his Angels, the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,

that cals himſelf a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or is a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> by Calling or profeſſion, have
been as long accuſtomed to the like riot or exceſſe, or take as great delight in
this Sin, as they did, which offered ſacrifice unto <hi>Bacchus:</hi> he is as true and
proper a <hi>Servant</hi> unto Satan, as they were. For Satan did deſire the ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

to gain the poſſeſion of their Souls, or a right or intereſt in their actions or

offered him ſacrifice or payed him tribute. Now if he have gotten the like
intereſt in their actions or imployments, or the like command over their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections,
which profeſſe themſelves to be Chriſtians; they are his by poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
or occupation: He needs no Sacrifice or ſolemn Tribute from them,
which, as we Say, <hi>He holdeth in his own hands.</hi> Briefly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

offered ſacrifice unto <hi>Bacchus,</hi> unleſſe by this cuſtome they brought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to be in <hi>Servitude</hi> unto the ſin of drunkenneſſe, were not more grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous

are in greater <hi>Servitude</hi> unto this loathſome Sin.</p>

Pattoneſſe of Love and wantonneſſe, did indeed and in the iſſue Worſhip
Satan and his unclean Spirits; which are the Authors, the Nouriſhers and
Maintainers of all bodily filthineſſe and uncleanneſſe. <hi>If any which profeſſeth
himſelf to be a Chriſtian, be as much given over unto wantonneſs and unclean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
as the Heathens were, which Worſhipped</hi> Venus: <hi>He is as true and abſolute
a Slave to Satan as they were, and ſhall be ſure to have his wages (without repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance)
as truly and fully paid him, as the other ſhall.</hi> The leaſt and beſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
which he payeth for the uſe of their actions or imployments during this
ſhort and brittle life, is an endleſſe and never-dying death.</p>
                  <p>6. Such of the <hi>Heathens</hi> as offered ſacrifice unto <hi>Pluto</hi> whom they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be the God of Riches or of wealth, <hi>Lord Paramount of Gold, of
Silver,</hi> of all kind of Metals, or whatſoever elſe was contained under the
ſurface of the Earth, did indeed Worſhip Satan and his infernal powers.
And the ſacrifice which they offered, and other Solemn ſervices which they
did unto him, ſhall be as evidences againſt them, at the Laſt day, that were
<pb n="3061" facs="tcp:100044:43"/>
his <hi>Servants,</hi> as a pledge or earneſt to bind them to accept his wages. If any
<hi>Chriſtians, how Preciſe or Devout ſoever</hi> they ſeem to be, though daily <hi>Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenters
of Publick Prayers,</hi> though <hi>diligent Hearers of Sermons,</hi> be as Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous,
as great Oppreſſors of their poor Brethren, as unconſcionable in their
gettings, as unſatiable in their deſires of gain, as the Heathens were, which
thought to purchaſe Wealth by ſacrificing unto <hi>Pluto;</hi> the bond of their <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude</hi>
unto Satan is altogether as firm and ſtrong; their <hi>Servitude</hi> or bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage
it ſelf altogether as hard, as great and dangerous, as the <hi>Servitude</hi> or
Bondage of the Heathens were. And whileſt they are in <hi>Servitude</hi> unto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan,
whatſoever <hi>they Profeſs</hi> or make ſhew of, they cannot be the <hi>Servants</hi>
of God or Chriſt. For <hi>no man</hi> (as our Saviour tels us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 24.) <hi>can ſerve
two Maſters, for either he will hate the one and love the other; or elſe he will hold
to the one and deſpiſe the other. Ye cannot ſerve God and Mammon.</hi> But what
doth he mean by <hi>Mammon?</hi> wealth, or riches only? Certainly a <hi>part of
his meaning is,</hi> That every covetous man; that every one which is extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
careful for gathering things of this Life; Every one that minds moſt
his gain or getting of riches, is a <hi>Servant</hi> to his riches, or to his deſires of
them. The <hi>other part of his meaning is</hi> that He which is a <hi>Servant</hi> to his
deſire of riches, is a <hi>Servant</hi> likewiſe unto him, whom the Heathens called
<hi>Mammon,</hi> and worſhipped as a ſuppoſed God of riches: For <hi>Mammon</hi>

know and believe, that there is no ſuch God or Lord of wealth, and that
there is but <hi>One God and One Lord,</hi> who is the Lord and owner as well of the
Earth and things in it, as of the Heavens: Yet have we no reaſon but to think,
that the <hi>Infernal Spirits</hi> have their ſeveral <hi>Wards or Quarters.</hi> Some of them

                  <p>7. Now this me thinks ſhould be a Great Motive to deterre or dehort any
man, from yielding Obedience to his own Deſire of what tranſitory Good
or Pleaſure ſoever, if he would but conſider, That, <hi>in yielding Obedience to
his own deſires, he becomes the ſervant of ſome ſin or other;</hi> and that in becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the <hi>Servant of any ſin</hi> whatſoever, he becometh the Bondman or <hi>ſlave of
Satan:</hi> who hath one bad propertie which no other Maſter, how cruel or
deviliſh ſoever, beſides himſelf, hath: and That is, <hi>To Plague or torment
them moſt, which have done him moſt continual and faithful Service.</hi> And
yet even this <hi>Diabolical Diſpoſition</hi> of his, becomes the faithful <hi>Executioner</hi>
of Gods <hi>Juſtice.</hi> For, every degree of their <hi>ſervice</hi> done to Satan, doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
in it a like degree or portion of <hi>Treaſon</hi> or Infidelity towards <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
And it is Juſt and holy on Gods part, though Satanical and Deviliſh on Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
to recompence ſuch, as have done Satan in this World greateſt ſervice,
<pb n="3062" facs="tcp:100044:44"/>
with the greateſt portion or meaſure of vengeance in the world to come. All
of us have ſome one or other of this Infernal Crue daily attending on us,
hourly watching or dogging us in all our deſigns or projects throughout cur
whole Courſe of life.</p>

deſire the continuance of bodily life and health, and neither life nor
health can be maintained or continued without food and rayment, and other
neceſſaries: Hence it is, that the more inbred and deeplier rooted deſire of

all ſuch as are not provided of things neceſſary for the maintenance of this

then by reſigning or making over their bodily imployments or labours

                     </note> The <hi>Original or Fundamental Temptation</hi> by which Satan draws men
into this ſnare of <hi>Servitude</hi> or bondage ſpiritual, is by enlarging or impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
their deſires, not of things ſimply evil, but of things either natural, or
indifferent; that is, for their kind or quality not unlawful. Theſe deſires<note place="margin">☜</note>
being improved unto the Full, or unto ſome Exceſſive Meaſure, do by long
cuſtome or continuance, require ſatisfaction by as ſtrong a Law of<note n="‖" place="margin">See Chap. 18. laſt</note> Neceſſity
(at leaſt as importunately) as our natural deſires of food or rayment do. The
more exceſſive or exorbitant any deſire is, the more impatient it is of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe.
It is as impoſſible for a greedy or <hi>Ravenous Appetite</hi> to be ſatiſfied
with a ſpare or moderate Diet, as for a moderate appetite to be ſatiſfied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any food at all. A vain <hi>Fantaſtick,</hi> that takes proud Cloathes to be
<hi>Part of Himſelf,</hi> is as deſirous of change of ſuits or coſtly apparel, as a poor
man is of apparel it ſelf, or of ſuch ſtuff as is ſufficient to keep out cold and
wet. An <hi>Ambitious Spirit</hi> is not ſo well content with an Ordinary place or
rank amongſt <hi>Free-men,</hi> as an ingenuous mind will
be with the eſtate or condition of an hired <hi>Servant;</hi> if
no better by means fair and honeſt be likely to befall
him. <hi>A Man apt to over-prize himſelf,</hi> and Jealous
withall of Contempt, of wrong, or of groſſe abuſe,

be calculated from thoſe deteſtable <hi>Services,</hi> into which Satan (by ſo little
a ſprig of this Forbidden Tree, as many Chriſtians would not ſuſpect to
bear any forbidden fruit) did impell <hi>Pontius Pilate.</hi> This Man thought in
his Conſcience that our <hi>Saviour was Innocent;</hi> that he was <hi>more then a man,</hi>
and was exceedingly willing to have ſaved him from death: And yet Satan
works him, not to do as <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelf would, but as Satan would have him
to do. <hi>Pilate,</hi> ſaith the Evangeliſt, <hi>ſought to releaſe him: but the Jews cryed
out ſaying; If thou letteſt this man go, thou art not</hi> Caeſars <hi>friend. For whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
maketh himſelf a King, ſpeaketh againſt</hi> Caeſar. And when <hi>Pilate</hi> heard
that ſaying, he proceeds to ſentence: And when the Chief Prieſts further
proſecuted their wonted Form, <hi>We have no King but Caeſar.</hi> He delivered
Jeſus unto them to be crucified, <hi>John 19. verſ.</hi> 12, 15, 16. To have corru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted
this man by <hi>Bribes</hi> or <hi>Gifts,</hi> to have given wrong ſentence againſt our

or intereſt in his <hi>Service</hi> by this <hi>Title.</hi> The only poſſeſſion or intereſt
he had in him to this purpoſe, was not ſo much <hi>deſire of new or greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi>
then he had, as <hi>Fear of diſgrace</hi> or diſreſpect with <hi>Caeſar:</hi> if when the
Mutinous Jews proteſted, <hi>They had no King but Caeſar,</hi> he ſhould ſuffer a man
to live, that was accuſed, and in ſome ſort convicted, to have ſuffered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to have been Entitled <hi>King of the Jews.</hi> Though his <hi>Ambition</hi> was not
great; yet it expoſed him to deſperate, baſe, and deteſtable <hi>Servitude</hi> or bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage.
It is not half ſo baſe or ſervile to be an <hi>Hang-man</hi> or other more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible
Miniſter or Executioner of publick Juſtice, as it is to be the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments
or Miniſters of Greateſt <hi>Caeſars</hi> in condemning the Innocent, or
ſentencing ſuch to death, as have no wayes deſerved it. If <hi>Pilate</hi> had taken
Courage to protect <hi>this Juſt</hi> and <hi>Holy One</hi> againſt the malicious calumnies of
the Jews; Gods providence no doubt had protected and ſhielded <hi>Pilates</hi>
breaſt from the violence of <hi>Pilates</hi> own right hand: Whereas he after having
loſt <hi>Caeſars Favour</hi> which he ſought by theſe unjuſt means to retain, did out
of the apprehenſion of his diſcontent or diſgrace make away himſelf, as the

through deſire of yielding Abſolute Obedience to Gods <hi>Viſible Church,</hi> and

Satan hath twice drawn a great part of Gods people, Such I mean as

<hi>Slavery</hi> or bondage into which he was able to draw the moſt wicked and moſt

Idolatrous Heathen, ſince the firſt Revolution of time, affording him op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of Temptation. The <hi>Firſt notorious or famous Conqueſt</hi> that Satan
got over the <hi>viſible Church,</hi> was in the dayes of our Saviours pilgrimage here
on Earth; The <hi>Second,</hi> over the viſible <hi>Romiſh Church</hi> within theſe later
years, wherein they have reſumed the <hi>Title</hi> or Prerogative which the <hi>Jewiſh
Church</hi> did ſtifly challenge, but with lamentable ſucceſſe for ſome years after
the firſt and ſecond Deſtruction of the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> The <hi>Title</hi> which
that <hi>Church</hi> did challenge, but with greater moderation then the preſent
<hi>Romiſh Church</hi> doth, was the <hi>Abſolute Infallibility</hi> of the Church repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
that is, of the chief Prieſts and Elders. Yet this <hi>Abſolute Infallibility</hi>
the Jewiſh Snagogue did never confine unto the boſome of the <hi>High Prieſt</hi>
either ſitting in <hi>Moſes Chair,</hi> or when He entred into the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi>
but to the <hi>Sanedrim</hi> or Common Council of the Prieſts and Elders, whereof
the high Prieſt was a more Principal then Neceſſary Member.</p>
                  <p>9. The improvement of this <hi>Jewiſh Hereſie</hi> and <hi>Slavery</hi> to Satan, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the <hi>Patriarchate of Rome,</hi> had its <hi>Original</hi> from an <hi>Ambitious Error</hi> in that
<hi>Church</hi> through ſucceſſion of times not very Ancient, <hi>by laying challenges to all
Gods promiſes made to his Vniverſal or Catholick Church, as to her own Peculiar
Prerogative.</hi> And as if this had not been enough: the ſucceſſors of theſe
deſperate Challengers have contracted the <hi>Catholick Church</hi> (which in their
Language is all one with the Church of <hi>Rome)</hi> unto the <hi>Pope</hi> and his <hi>Cardinals,</hi>
or as they term it, the <hi>Sacred Conſiſtory.</hi> Some later <hi>Canoniſts</hi> and <hi>Paraſites</hi>
to the <hi>Pope, Jeſuites</hi> eſpecially, have laboured to drive the <hi>Vniverſal Church</hi>
(like a <hi>Camel</hi> through a needles eye) into the <hi>Popes Breaſt alone,</hi> whenſoever
he ſhall deliver his Sentence <hi>ex Cathedra;</hi> as if, as well all Gods <hi>Promiſes</hi> as
<hi>Bleſſings</hi> promiſed to his <hi>Catholick Church</hi> were, The One to be diſpoſed of,
The Other to be diſpenſed by him, as by Chriſts ſole <hi>Vicar General</hi> or Vice-Roy
here on Earth. But theſe <hi>Poſitions,</hi> ſome <hi>Interimiſts</hi> or Labourers for
Reconciliation betwixt the <hi>Church of Rome</hi> &amp; of <hi>England,</hi> wil hapily reply, are
but the Opinions of private men, not maintained or taught by the <hi>Catholick

<hi>Prieſts,</hi> or <hi>Laicks</hi> of inferiour ranke will or dare deny, that the <hi>Infallible
Guidance</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt for Leading Chriſts <hi>Church</hi> into the truth, is
immediately annexed to the <hi>Roman Church</hi> Repreſentative, that is, to all ſuch
<hi>Councils</hi> or Aſſemblies of Chriſtian men as are called by the <hi>Pope</hi> as <hi>Chriſts
Vice-Roy,</hi> and approved of by him and his <hi>Aſſiſtants.</hi> The <hi>Neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence</hi>

Church unto Satan in reſpect of <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Heathens</hi> punctually conſiſt? In <hi>This</hi>
eſpecially, That if any <hi>Council,</hi> Wherein the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> or <hi>Patriarch of
the Weſt</hi> (as his Stile ſometimes was) had any principal Intereſt or Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

Negligences, Ignorances or other enormous ſins and iniquities, whether

as well for their Fore-Fathers Tranſgreſſions as for their own, in reſpect of
what is paſt; and to pray for the prevention of the like, in times to come.
Now this is the Greateſt <hi>Yoke of Slavery</hi> that Satan durſt or could attempt to
Lay upon the neck of <hi>Chriſts Church Militant</hi> here on Earth; albeit he could
by ſubtilty prevail to place his <hi>Primogenitus,</hi> (that is, ſuch an <hi>Antichriſt</hi> as

his Game by playing (as we ſay) both with the Stock and Cardes-dealt. Firſt
he pretends to the Senators, that he was in as great danger as any of them
were; and yet would free them all, ſo they would give him leave to act his
Part. Having perſwaded the Senators to ſhut themſelves up in the Porch
of their Houſe of Aſſembly, and deliver their Keyes to his Cuſtody, He
inſtantly carries them to the Commons, telling them they had now a fair
Opportunity to be revenged of the Senate, to puniſh every man amongſt
them according to his deſerts without any danger of Bloud-ſhed to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:
but adds this Advice withall, that ſeeing they muſt of neceſſity have
a Senate or Council of State, they would not depoſe or puniſh any of the
preſent Senators, before they had nominated a fitter man in his place. After
Two or Three had been propoſed by ſome few Ringleaders, the major

competent enough in Particulars.</hi> The Obſervation is not amiſſe, and ſo farr
as it is not amiſſe, will better befit the Iſſue of this Diſpute between our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour

Hence they <hi>Reply</hi> to this Purpoſe. <q>
                        <hi>We be</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed,</hi> and though
Conquer'd by the Romans,</q> yet are we not made Slaves, or brought into

they had ſo far <hi>Believed</hi> on him, or given that Reſpect unto him which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
before they had done.</p>
                  <p>6. But this <hi>Revolt</hi> our Saviour did foreſee, and gave them a <hi>Caveat</hi> to
prevent it, verſe 31. where he ſaith not, as ſome Zealous Profeſſors have
in his Name miſtaught their Auditors in our dayes <hi>[If once ye</hi>

All theſe Gradations are Litterally, and Emphatically implied in the plain
Grammatical Senſe and meaning of our Saviours Speech from verſe 30 to
the words of my <hi>Text,</hi> and more apparently in the next verſe following. <hi>I
know that ye are</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſeed, but ye ſeek to kill me, becauſe my word hath no
place in you.</hi> Theſe words were not directed to the altogether <hi>Vnbelieving</hi>
or Contradicting Jews, with whom he had diſputed from verſe 12. to the
29. They neceſſarily referr unto thoſe Jews which had <hi>Believed in Part,</hi> and
afforded the <hi>Aſſent</hi> of the Braine unto his Doctrine, but left no place for his
word in their <hi>Hearts,</hi> Theſe being full ſtuft with corrupt Affections, as with
Pride, Ambition and Hopes of Earthly Pomps and Dignities from their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<hi>Meſſias.</hi> When he ſaith <hi>[Becauſe my word hath no place in you]</hi> We
are to underſtand <hi>No place of Reſidence</hi> or <hi>Permanent Habitation;</hi> although it
had found ſome Entrance into their Fancies. Or will ye have a further Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
why <hi>His Word,</hi> that is, <hi>The Fundamental Point or Myſtery of Faith,</hi> which
he had lately taught, had <hi>No Place in them?</hi> Take it in his own words, <hi>I
ſpeak That</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>which I have ſeen with my Father, and ye do
that which ye have ſeen with your Father,</hi> verſe 38. He had granted them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to be <hi>Abrahams ſeed,</hi> but now expreſſeth his <hi>Meaning</hi> to be, that they
were a kind of <hi>Abortivate</hi> or ill thriven <hi>Seed, no true Sons</hi> or children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham.</hi>
But as yet they did not fully underſtand whom he meant by <hi>His Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi>
or whom by <hi>Their Father.</hi> And for this Reaſon they only reſume the

They, verſe 39. without adding any Gall unto it. But our Saviours <hi>Rejoynder</hi>
is not altogether the ſame, but ſomewhat more ſmart and full. Before, he
had granted them to be <hi>Abrahams Seed,</hi> but now, he denies them to be <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams
ſons,</hi> in the later part of the ſame 39 verſe, <hi>If ye were</hi> Abrahams <hi>ſons,
ye would do the works of</hi> Abraham, <hi>But now</hi> (verſe, 40.) <hi>ye ſeek to kill me, a
man that have told you the truth—This did not Abraham.</hi> And again verſe 41.
he intimates unto them, who was <hi>their True Father,</hi> that was <hi>neither God nor
Abraham.</hi> Who then was their True Father, or whoſe children were they
indeed? This he tels them plainly, verſe 44. <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil,

and abode not in the truth, becauſe there is no truth in him;</hi> That is, by not
abiding in <hi>the Truth,</hi> or that Image of God wherein he was created, he loſt
<hi>all Seeds of Truth,</hi> and became a meer Lyar and the Father of Lyes. And
ſo theſe Jews were in the <hi>Truth</hi> whileſt they <hi>Believed</hi> on Him who was <hi>the
True Son of God,</hi> yet did not <hi>Abide</hi> in it, after he had told them, <hi>The truth

<hi>Odious Compariſons,</hi> that they were <hi>Sons of God</hi> in an equal or better manner
then he was. And in Concluſion, after he had told them, that they were
as yet ſons of the Devil, that is, men of murtherous minds and envious to
the Truth; they anſwer him boldly and glory in their Anſwer too. <hi>Say
we not well that thou art a Samaritan and haſt a Devil?</hi> verſe 48. And if a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maritan,
then no Son of God, but rather a Conjurer or ſervant of the
Devil.</p>
                  <p>7. Thus you have heard to <hi>what height of Contradiction To the Truth,</hi> to
the <hi>Son of God,</hi> (who is The Truth and The Life of the world) and <hi>to their

Aſſemblies had done before. And this they did without Contradiction
of any ſave of the Scribes and Phariſees, Prieſts, and Elders. Scarce any
King or Emperour whether Chriſtian or Heatheniſh, ſince the world began,
was entertained with ſuch lofty Gratulations from ſo many mouths and
hands at once, as our Saviour ſome three or four dayes before he was Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed.
The Triumphant Salutations which had been tendred to <hi>David by
Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> at his Coronation, were but a Model of the loud Echoes of
<hi>Hoſanna to the Son of David, Hoſanna in the Higheſt, Bleſſed be the Son of
David that cometh in the name of the Lord,</hi> and other Expreſſions of
this peoples Joy when our Saviour (according to the <hi>Prophecy</hi>) came into
<hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> What was the reaſon of their <hi>Vnparallel'd Exultation?</hi> only
<hi>Their Belief</hi> of the late Miracles, which he had wrought upon <hi>Lazarus</hi> and
ſome other Private Men, and their hopes that he would do <hi>Greater Wonders</hi>
then theſe for their Good and for the <hi>Glory of their Nation;</hi> As <hi>Firſt</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver
them from the preſent <hi>Roman yoke;</hi> and <hi>afterward</hi> to make them <hi>Lords</hi>
of the <hi>Nations,</hi> through which they were ſcattered. But after he had by his
Fathers appointment rendred himſelf to the High Prieſt and Elders without
a Blow Given (beſide that which <hi>Peter</hi> gave to <hi>Malchus)</hi> and ſubmitted
himſelf to the <hi>Roman Deputy</hi> without Reſiſtance. They begun to caſt doubts
in their minds, and thought, that he, who could not, or would not defend
himſelf from ſuch violence, was not able or would not be willing to protect,
much leſſe to advance them unto Greater Dignities. And ſo, by Degrees
within a ſhort ſpace the very ſame Parties of <hi>Exultant Believers in Him,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<hi>Cruel Perſecutors of Him;</hi> Changing their late joyful <hi>Hymns</hi> of <hi>Hoſanna
to the Son of David</hi> into ſad <hi>Madrigals</hi> of <hi>Crucifige, Crucifige,</hi> Let him be
crucified, Let him be crucified like a Slave. And thus the whole Nation
almoſt did remarkably fulfil our Saviours Prediction of theſe Jews mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
verſe 44. of this Chapter, <hi>Ye are of your father the Devil, and the luſts of
your father ye will do: He was a murtherer from the beginning, and he abode not

or Boaſtings, and that is given us by our Saviour himſelf in this
Goſpel, Chap. 14. verſ. 15, 23, 24. If ye love me keep my Commandments.
And again, Chap. 15. verſ. 10. If ye keep my Commandments ye ſhall abide
in my love. How many may we find who in diſtreſſe or danger, whether by
Sea or Land, ſpecially in grievous ſtormes or ſickneſſe will ſeriouſly purpoſe

[Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, even ſo do unto them,
for this is the Law and the Prophets.] So far is the whole Chriſtian world
(as we call it) from keeping this Commandment, that the <hi>Practiſes moſt

<hi>Dangerous;</hi> But the <hi>Violation of it in theſe Times of Mortality, of Calamity and

in a <hi>Power to Reſlect</hi> upon what he hath ſeen, heard, or felt, or remembers,

Every ſon of man who hath attained unto the uſe of Reaſon, hath to
number ſuch Occurrences as have befallen himſelf, or ſuch as he hath ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved

and a further <hi>Branch</hi> of the ſame <hi>Reflective Power</hi> or Faculty to <hi>Calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late</hi>

                  <p>6. From this <hi>Reflective Power</hi> or Faculty and the Branches of it, all of them
being <hi>Peculiar to man,</hi> amongſt all viſible or middle-world-Creatures, doth

that <hi>Freedom of Will</hi> immediately Reſult: the ſearch of whoſe ſeveral <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches,</hi>
whether growing by <hi>Nature</hi> and bettered by Gods ſpecial <hi>Providence,</hi>
or immediately implanted or ingrafted by <hi>Grace,</hi> is the principal <hi>Subject</hi> of
the Treatiſes following.</p>
                  <p>7. The <hi>Firſt Root</hi> of this kind of <hi>Freedom,</hi> as it is <hi>Mans Peculiar</hi> above all
other viſible Creatures, is, That <hi>Reflective Power</hi> before-mentioned upon
his Obſervations, whether made upon the diſpoſitions or <hi>Docility of Senſitive
Creatures</hi> wild or tame, or upon the <hi>ſuggeſtions</hi> or Operations <hi>of his own ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
or that part of thoſe Faculties of his Soul or Body, in which he is rather
a <hi>Senſitive Contradiſtinct</hi> to <hi>meer Senſitives,</hi> then any way <hi>ſupereminent</hi> to
them. Now there is not, at leaſt there ought not to be, any ſcruple or Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion;
Whether every man which hath attained to the uſe of Reaſon or of
ordinary diſcretion, have not the ſame Power or Faculty to correct or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
his own natural Diſpoſitions' or <hi>Senſitive Inclinations,</hi> which <hi>Lycurgus</hi>
practiſed with good ſucceſſe upon his <hi>Two Whelps</hi> of the ſame kind. No Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
again there is or ought to be, Whether Parents or other Inſtructers
have not the like Power to correct or alter the inclinations of Children in
their Minority or Nonage, by good Diſcipline or Education. Whence if
we ſhould grant that <hi>Poſtulatum</hi> or ſuppoſition which <hi>Galen</hi> that great <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher</hi>
and <hi>Phyſitian</hi> with much diligence hath endeavoured to Demonſtrate,
<hi>[Mores animi ſequuntur temper amentum Corporis: that the manners or diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions

of the body:]</hi> Yet can it never be evinced or made Probable, that the Peculiar
Temperature of any mans body, may not be altered by the forementioned
<hi>Reflective Power</hi> which every man hath, and may exerciſe over his own ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
humours, or manner of dyet; or to ruminate upon the Advertiſments
given him by <hi>Philoſophers</hi> or <hi>Phyſitians,</hi> either for correcting his inordinate

in ſome degree or other, by nature implanted in men or Children of the

dye uncured</hi> of that <hi>Erronious</hi> or <hi>Heretical Opinion</hi> which was the ſcope of his
Book, or of that diſtemperature whether of body or of mind which did breed
that Opinion: Yet a Late Learned<note n="†" place="margin">Baptis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>8. But the <hi>Principal,</hi> if not the only <hi>Stem</hi> of the fore-mentioned <hi>Freedom,</hi>
conſiſts in mans <hi>Power</hi> to <hi>Reflect</hi> upon his own <hi>Rational Thoughts</hi> or Projects.
And this Power or Faculty no man, no power on earth can alter or take from
another, how mean ſoever. For it is truly ſaid, if it be rightly applied,
that <hi>Thought is Free, not from Puniſhment,</hi> if we think amiſſe, For <hi>the Sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher
of Hearts</hi> will Judge the moſt Secret Thoughts: but <hi>Free from Coaction,</hi>
from conſtraint, or inforcement, We may be commanded or inforced to
<hi>Do</hi> what another will have us to <hi>do:</hi> but we cannot be compelled to <hi>think</hi>
what another would have us <hi>think;</hi> or to <hi>Will</hi> what they would have
us to <hi>Will.</hi> They may Propoſe ſome <hi>Particular</hi> unto us being in it ſelf very
<hi>Good</hi> and agreeable unto our deſires: yet the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of it unleſſe we pleaſe,
cannot conſtrain or enforce us to deſire it for that time. If we want ſome

from it, the very <hi>Goodneſs of the Free exerciſe of our own Will,</hi> will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice.
The very <hi>Trial</hi> or Experiment of this our <hi>Freedom</hi> and Power to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain
from many things in themſelves deſireable, and with which moſt men

<hi>Freed</hi> from all Neceſſity of doing or not doing of what it doth or doth not)
in Reſpect of ſome Acts, Operations, or Objects.] This Aſſertion we take
as granted out of the Grounds of <hi>Philoſophie.</hi> For this <hi>Freedom</hi> whereof we treat,
is one of the moſt <hi>Eſſential,</hi> if not the very Firſt and <hi>Radical Prerogative</hi> which
Reaſon hath above Senſe.</p>
                  <p>6. Our <hi>ſecond Aſſertion</hi> ſhall be This: <hi>[The moſt Excellent Intellectual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
the very Excellency of Nature, Eſſence and Intellection, is not Free with this
Freedom of Indifferencie or Option in reſpect of Every Object.]</hi> God Almighty
himſelf is not <hi>Free</hi> with this kind of <hi>Freedom,</hi> to Act or intend Good or Evil.
The <hi>Infinity of his Tranſcendent Goodneſſe,</hi> or (which is all one) the Immen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of his All-Sufficiency, abſolutely exempts him from all Temptation or
Poſſibility of intending harm to any of his Creatures which are capable of
wrong. In that he is the <hi>Infinite Fountain of Goodneſſe Moral,</hi> he cannot be
the Author or Abetter of any thing which is Morally Evil: Nay the very
beſt Operation that can be aſcribed to the Almighty Father (to wit, the
Eternal Generation of his only Son) is not <hi>Free</hi> in the <hi>Second</hi> but only in the
<pb n="3089" facs="tcp:100044:59"/>
                     <hi>Former Senſe</hi> above mentioned. He was begotten of the ſubſtance of his
Father before all Worlds, by <hi>Neceſsity</hi> more then Natural. And He that
from Eternity thus begat Him, doth ſo infinitely and Eternally Love his only
Begotten Son, as he can never ceaſe to Love Him, or begin to hate Him. So
that the Almighty Himſelf in reſpect of his Love to his Only Son, was never
<hi>Free</hi> according to either Branch of <hi>Freedom</hi> mentioned, to wit, either with
the <hi>Freedom</hi> of <hi>contrariety</hi> or <hi>contradiction.</hi> But (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>Of his
own Will begot he Vs with the word of Truth:</hi> We are his Sons by Adoption,
not by Nature, nor by any <hi>Neceſsity</hi> Equivalent to that which is Natural.
It was more <hi>Free</hi> for him to adopt or not to adopt us, then it is for any Father
to appoint his Heirs or Executors, or to <hi>Eſtate</hi> or diſpoſſeſſe his Children.</p>
                  <p>7. In as much as <hi>Goodneſſe</hi> is the <hi>Eſſential Object</hi> of our heavenly Fathers
moſt <hi>Holy Will;</hi> it is moſt Eſſential and moſt <hi>Neceſſary</hi> to <hi>Him,</hi> to <hi>Will</hi> nothing,
but that which is <hi>Good:</hi> Yet is <hi>He</hi> not hereby either <hi>Eſſentially</hi> or <hi>neceſſarily</hi>
tied to will <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That</hi> Particular Good. All things that are truly Good
were Created by <hi>Him:</hi> Nor was it <hi>Neceſſary</hi> that he ſhould Create <hi>theſe Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars</hi>
and no others. Yea, it was <hi>Free</hi> for him to create or not to create any
thing at all. So then within the <hi>Sphere of Goodneſſe,</hi> He is <hi>Liberum Agens,</hi> An
Agent moſt <hi>Free.</hi> It was <hi>Free</hi> for him to create or not to create us: It is <hi>Free</hi>
for him to preſerve or not preſerve us; yea to preſerve or deſtroy us: It is
<hi>Free</hi> for him to Elect or not to Elect us, or to deſtinate us to Life or Death
Eternal. <hi>He woundeth and he maketh whole: He giveth Life and taketh it away
at his pleaſure: He bringeth down unto the grave, and

                  <p>10. The <hi>Angels</hi> which kept their <hi>Firſt Station</hi> when the Rebellious did

them of ſerving God and him only, yet not hereby <hi>neceſſarily</hi> conſtrained or

                  <p>1. BUt before we come to ſpeak of the Unregenerate Mans <hi>Free-will</hi> and

utterly to take it from us, or by Timorous Scrupuloſities to quell

to every Readers Conſideration; That between a <hi>meer natural man,</hi>
and a <hi>Man utterly forſaken of God,</hi> there is a <hi>Mean</hi> or Difference; yea per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a greater Difference (in reſpect of the end of theſe inſuing Quaeries,
to wit, the ſalvation of mens ſouls) then is between the State of a man Ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly
for ſaken of God, and of Satan and his Angels.</p>
                  <p>2. In reſpect of <hi>Good and Evil</hi> the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> in the Firſt Creation
was as truly and as properly <hi>Free,</hi> as the <hi>Angelical.</hi> The <hi>Firſt Man</hi> was Like

his Creator truly and <hi>inherently Good,</hi> indued with <hi>Power of doing Well:</hi> But
<hi>this his Power was matched with a Poſſibility of doing Evil.</hi> And by his <hi>Free</hi> and
wilful <hi>Reduction</hi> of this <hi>Power into Act,</hi> He and his Children have utterly loſt
all <hi>Poſſibility</hi> of doing Well. By nature, All of us are the Children of Wrath;
the <hi>Servants of ſin</hi> from our birth: Nor can we be <hi>Freed</hi> from this <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>3. But though this <hi>Tenent</hi> of Reformed Churches be moſt true, to wit,
That the Humane Nature before Adams <hi>Fall</hi> was as truly <hi>Free</hi> as the Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical,
and that all the Sons of men ſince his <hi>Fall</hi> are as truly ſubject to ſin as the

<hi>Freedom,</hi> nor this <hi>Servitude</hi> of ſin in us ſo great, as that which is in the
Devils. For not to ſpeak of the Elect or ſuch as are certainly deſtinated to
ſalvation; the State of <hi>Cain</hi> (the Father of Reprobates) before he ſlew his
Brother <hi>Abel</hi> (though we conſider it with reference to the Eternal Decree of
Reprobation) was not ſo deſperate, as the Eſtate of the old Serpent. For
God certainly did never uſe that mild and gentle Language either to Satan or
his Angels, which he did to <hi>Cain</hi> a little before he ſlew his Brother. <hi>And the
Lord ſaid unto</hi> Cain, <hi>why art thou wroth? and why is thy Countenance fallen?
If thou doeſt well, ſhalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doeſt not well, ſin Lieth
at the door: and unto thee ſhall be his deſire, and thou ſhalt rule over him,</hi> Gen. 4.
6, 7. Howbeit if at any time it had pleaſed the wiſdom of God to make Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<hi>Profers of Impoſſibilities</hi> to his Creatures Choice: Satan and his Angels by
rule of Retaliation, had been the fitteſt Subjects of ſuch <hi>Profers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">☜</note> becauſe it
is their continual Practice to delude mankind in their miſery, with fair pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
of thoſe things which either they are not able, or never purpoſe to
perform.</p>
                  <p>4. But ſeeing the ſons of men (until they be redeemed by Chriſt) and
wicked Spirits are both alike <hi>Servants to Sin,</hi> though their <hi>Servitude</hi> to it be
not Equal: the Queſtion is <hi>[Wherein the Inequality of their Servitude conſiſts?]</hi>
The Depth of the Angels <hi>Fall</hi> was by the Eternal Rule of Juſtice proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the Height of their knowledge and Happineſſe when they ſtood. Now
their Firſt Station was much higher then mans; the one in Heaven, the other
in Paradiſe. And as they ſinned more wilfully and haughtily: ſo they
continued more wilful and ſtubborn in the courſe of ſin, then man. The
<hi>Neceſſity</hi> which they brought upon themſelves is <hi>Two-fold:</hi> Firſt, a <hi>Neceſsity</hi> of
doing alwayes that which is in its Own Nature Evil; Secondly, a <hi>Neceſsity</hi>
of doing ſuch evil, with <hi>poſitively evil intentions.</hi> It is their delight to Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termand
Gods Laws; to make his Negative Precepts Their Affirmatives;
and his Affirmatives their Negatives. And knowing much better then moſt
men do, with what particulars God is more ſpecially offended: they tempt
every man, (as opportunity ſerves) to do thoſe things wherwith he is moſt of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended.
To tempt ſome men unto groſſe, foul, or baſe ſins, they ſee it boot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe.
Nevertheleſſe in as much as no man can be without ſome ſin or other;
they ſollicite all to be like themſelves in one ſin at leaſt, that is, in <hi>Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency.</hi>
And to be finally Impenitent for the leaſt ſin, is more offenſive to the
Goodneſſe and Mercy of God, then all other ſins that can be by man Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                  <p>5. But ſome happily will thus far plead for <hi>Baal</hi> or <hi>Belzebub</hi> and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers;
That many good Turns are done by them to ſome men. Yet even

                  <p>9. All of us at the Firſt uſe of Reaſon have a true <hi>Freedom of Will</hi> in avoiding
ſuch Occaſions or Opportunities to ſin, as being not avoided but Voluntarily
and <hi>Freely</hi> affected, draw a <hi>Neceſſity</hi> upon us of falling into foul and grievous
ſins. It was perhaps impoſſible for <hi>AEgiſthus</hi> to avoid Adultery, ſo long as
he betroathed himſelf to Sloth. But it was not impoſſible for him (nor for
any) to have avoided this diſeaſe; or at Leaſt, to have been divorced from
it, after he had been betrothed to it. The <hi>Poet</hi> in my Opinion gave us a
truer Cauſe of this mans fault, then thoſe <hi>Divines</hi> poſſibly can, which make
all Events <hi>Neceſſary</hi> or unavoidable in reſpect of Gods Decree:
<q>
                        <l>Quaeritur <hi>AEgiſthus</hi> quare ſit factus Adulter?</l>
                        <l>In promptu cauſa eſt; <hi>deſidioſus</hi> erat.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. Suppoſing his ſlothfulneſſe had been no ſin in its ſelf: yet would it
be a grievous ſin in us to ſay, that the Almighty did <hi>Decree</hi> he ſhould be
ſlothful, that he might become an Adulterer; or be an Adulterer, that he
might become a Reprobate, for manifeſtation of his Glory. His ſlothful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
in true Divinity was the true and <hi>Neceſſary</hi> Cauſe of his Filthineſſe:
But of his ſlothfulneſſe there was no <hi>Neceſſary Cauſe,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">To uſe <hi>Free-will</hi> extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amiſſe, is not <hi>Neceſſary</hi> but <hi>Contingent.</hi>
                     </note> but a <hi>Cauſe Contingent</hi>
only. The only Cauſe it had was the ill uſe of that <hi>Freedom</hi> which he had in
doing amiſſe, or avoiding Occaſions of doing greater evil. Now to uſe our
<hi>Free-will</hi> further amiſſe then is <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> is meerly <hi>Contingent;</hi> no way <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</hi>
Albeit he could do nothing as he ought: yet he might have done
leſſe ill in being imployed in ſome honeſt Vocation or Lawful Exerciſe, then
by giving himſelf over to Pamper, Eaſe, and Sloth. In Lawful imployments
we are commonly freed from all other ill Gueſts, beſides our ſelves: <hi>In
Living Idlely or doing nothing, we make our very hearts, our brains, and ſouls
like Empty Rooms for the Infernal Spirits to ſet up Shop in.</hi> The Poets Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
is very uſeful for all, but <hi>moſt Peculiar</hi> for Younger Students, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
in Terms to their Liking;

If Men would give ſome Divine Precepts or Sentences, full Poſſeſſion of
their <hi>Morning Thoughts;</hi> theſe would ſerve as ſo many Armed Men to keep
out the ſuggeſtions of the Devil,<note place="margin">☜</note> the World and the fleſh, from entring into
their Hearts.</p>
                  <p>11. To hold this <hi>Freedom of Will</hi> in avoiding Occaſions or motives to ſin,
is moſt agreeable to the Doctrine of the Reformed Churches. All which
(if I miſtake not) permit a <hi>Moderate and lawful Vſe of Vows,</hi> not only to men
already ſanctified or in the eſtate of Grace, but unto all ſuch as deſire to
avoid ſin and the <hi>Motives</hi> thereunto, that they may be ſanctified. In theſe
<hi>two Points</hi> I hope we ſhall all agree: <hi>Firſt,</hi> That we may not Vow any thing
which is not in our Power. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the avoidance of Occaſions or
<pb n="3094" facs="tcp:100044:62"/>
Motives to groſſe or known ſins is one of the moſt proper and moſt ſafe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of ſolemn <hi>Vows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. Some of our Wiſe and Godly Founders of Colledges, which died
before Reformation begun do not tye us by oath, never to tranſgreſs in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Manners or Crime: But to undergo puniſhment for breach of good
manners they ſtrictly tye us <hi>Virtute Juramenti.</hi> What is the reaſon? Surely
that which we ſaid before: They well knew, that to undergo ordinary pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment,
as loſſe of Commons, or the like, was in <hi>our Power,</hi> and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
juſt matter of <hi>Vow:</hi> But to avoid al actions puniſhable was not (as they
foreſaw)
in <hi>our Power;</hi> No part of the Object of our <hi>Free-will:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they made it no Branch of that Solemn Vow which we make to God for
Obſervation of their Statutes.</p>
                  <p>13. Now as it is Lawful to Vow ſtrict Obſervance of outward means,
either uſeful for avoiding groſſer ſins, or for repenting for them once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted:
So God upon diligent and faithful obſervance of our <hi>Vows</hi> in theſe
or the like ſubjects, doth not only free us from being led into grievous tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
but ſo enlargeth our <hi>Freedom of Will</hi> in other Points, that by the
aſſiſtance of his Gracious Providence we gain ſome Power over our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
and affections, which before we had not. This cannot ſeem ſtrange in
the courſe of Nature, eſpecially if we conſider it as ſubject to Gods Favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
Providence. For ſeeing our carnal appetites or affections are alwayes
nouriſhed and ſtrengthened by External Occaſions or Opportunities, they
muſt needs be ſtarved or weakned by Subſtraction of this their Nutriment.
And the weaker they are, the better hand the ſpirit or Conſcience gets over
them; the eaſier they are to be tamed and nurtured.</p>
                  <p>14. Many men have not the Power to abſtain from Dainties when they
are ſet before them, or when they are invited to taſte them: And the more
yielding they are to ſuch Invitations, the greater Liberty will their Appetites
take, and leave them leſſe Power to abſtain from riotous Feaſting. But until
<hi>Long Cuſtom</hi> hath brought forth a worſe diſpoſition then we bring with us
from our Cradles: it is farr more <hi>Free</hi> and Eaſie for us to abſtain from Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
of unhallowed Mirth (or Good-Fellowſhip, as they are termed) then
to abſtain from thoſe Courſes which are uſually followed in them, after we
be once accuſtomed to them, <hi>In reſpect of every Negative Precept or things
forbidden, it is always More Eaſie to avoid the Firſt</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">This is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in that Great Example and Champion of Chaſtity, <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Joſeph.</hi> Who durſt not ſtay to ſtruggle for his Garme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t (though it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerned him highly to have got away that which he knew would be made a Cloke for his Mistreſſes ſin, and a Colour of His:) but haſted and fled. Chuſing rather to leave behind him a ſeeming Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Guilt, then by longer ſtay (or Reaſoning after thoſe two Arguments, <hi>of Wrong done a Good Maſter,</hi> and <hi>Sin againſt a Good God,</hi> would not diſſwade) to incur a Real Danger, of becoming Guilty. Even ſo it is commanded, 2 Tim. 2. 22. <hi>Fly away from Luſt.</hi> We may and must reſiſt the Devil and fight it out againſt Him: but for Lust, the only way is (as when the houſe it on fire) Avoidance and Flight. Haſte away, Eſcape for thy life, (and Thy Souls Life) Look not behind Thee, nor ſtay; leſt the fire overtake thee, and ſo thou be conſumed in the Flame.</note> 
                     <hi>Occaſions, then to reſiſt
inſuing Opportunities.</hi> And the more Careful we are in avoiding <hi>Firſt Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,</hi>
the more Capable we are (as was before intimated) of Gods <hi>Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Providence</hi> to ſhield us from the aſſaults of Satan. Not that the leſſe
Abuſe of our <hi>Free-will</hi> in Evil or in avoiding Occaſions that lead unto it, can
<hi>Merit</hi> any ſuch Favour; but the Extream Abuſe of ſuch <hi>Free-will</hi> as we have,
Exempts us from thoſe Priviledges which Gods Infinite Bounty beſtowes
on us.</p>
                  <p>15. But let us take a man which hath been ſo far from avoiding, that he
hath been alwayes induſtrious in ſeeking out Occaſions to tranſgreſſe; a man
that by continual entertainment of all Opportunities to ſin, hath yielded up
his ſoul to many foul and grievous ſins: What <hi>Freedom of Will;</hi> what choice
<pb n="3095" facs="tcp:100044:62"/>
of means for working Mortification or amendment, can be imagined
to be left in ſuch a Man? ſhall we ſay he hath <hi>Freedom of Will inter
Mala?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">What portion of <hi>Freedom</hi> is in ſuch as <hi>Sin</hi> Extreamly.</note> This were <hi>Deſtruere Suppoſitum.</hi> We will rather ſuppoſe him to have
ſo far abuſed that <hi>Free-Will</hi> which men naturally have in doing Evil; that of
<hi>Two,</hi> of <hi>Three,</hi> of <hi>Four,</hi> or more <hi>Evils</hi> propoſed together, he would be ready
to chuſe <hi>The Very Worſt;</hi> alwayes prone to imbrace thoſe Opportunities with
greateſt ſpeed, which lead to greateſt miſchiefs; One, <hi>Cui, e malis, id maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mè
placet, quod eſt maximum.</hi> Is there any Method or place for medicine to
this diſeaſe? <hi>The wicked</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>are like the troubled Sea, when
it cannot reſt, whoſe waters caſt up mire and dirt. There is no peace ſaith my
God to the wicked,</hi> Eſay 57. 20, 21. Now as the moſt dangerous and turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
ſeas do not rage when the winds are calm: So neither do the wicked
ſome out their ſhame, when Actual Temptations or provocations ceaſe.
And in as much as Occaſions and Opportunities do not at all times preſent
themſelves: Even he that hath no power to reſiſt the leaſt temptation that
offers it ſelf, nor <hi>Freedom of Will</hi> to refuſe the greateſt Evil, and chuſe the
leaſt when both are actually proffered, may in the Ceſſation of Actual Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations,
<hi>Reflect</hi> upon his former Acts, and take a ſurvey of his life paſt;
eſpecially if he be thereto occaſioned or perſwaded by a diſcreet Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
one that will not affright him <hi>with the Marks of Reprobation.</hi> The firſt
Branch of <hi>Freedom,</hi> or rather, the very root of <hi>Free-Will</hi> in every Reaſonable
Creature, is ſeated in this Power of <hi>Reflexion upon its own Acts.</hi> This is <hi>the
Firſt Point</hi> or Property, wherein Reaſon doth exceed Senſe. Now he that
hath but this Branch of <hi>Freedom,</hi> to Calculate his former Acts; hath with
it a Power to <hi>Charge his Soul</hi> with the heavy burthen of his ſins. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
will alwayes be ready in quiet thoughts to accuſe the Fleſh, and urge
the Soul to bear Teſtimony againſt it. And the ſoul or Conſcience once
brought to loath or diſlike ſome ſpecial ſins is thereby made more <hi>Free;</hi> apt
to bewail all other ſins whatſoever, whether Actual or Original. Unleſſe
<hi>David</hi> had been throughly ſtung with the Conſcience of murther or Adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,
that ſweet Confeſſion had never found ſuch perfect vent as it did: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
I was ſhapen in iniquity, and in ſin did my mother conceive me,</hi> Pſal. 51. 5.
Every Creature on whom the Creator hath beſtowed any ſenſe or feeling of
pain or pleaſure, hath Power to imploy ſome motive Faculty, for avoiding
things grievous or hurtful, or for attaining things pleaſant and uſeful for
bettering their preſent Eſtate. And if man have any ſenſe or feeling of his
heavy burthen, he cannot but in ſome ſort or other deſire to be releaſed from
it. Upon this Principle, is that Exhortation of our Saviour, Grounded:
<hi>Come unto me all ye that Labour and are heavy Laden, and I will eaſe you,</hi>
Mat. 11. 28.</p>
                  <p>16. So then albeit there be a true <hi>Freedom of Will</hi> in all the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi>
(which are not utterly or finally forſaken of God:) yet is not this <hi>Freedom</hi>
the ſame in all, neither in reſpect of its <hi>Objects</hi> or <hi>Acts,</hi> nor in reſpect of its
<hi>Degrees</hi> or Strength. Some have a Competent Meaſure of <hi>Liberty</hi> to avoid
Occaſions or external Motives to known ſins; but either no portion of like
<hi>Liberty,</hi> or a very Little One, to reſiſt ſuch temptations to foul ſins, as come
upon them unexpectedly. Others have a Competent Meaſure of like <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>
to reſiſt Temptations or Opportunities to groſſe ſins, but little or none
at all to bewaile their natural miſery, or to beat down their inbred Pride by
Contemplation of Sin Original, or by Reflecting upon ſins of Omiſſion, or
Poſitive Acts of ordinary Tranſgreſſion. Others again which had deprived
themſelves of all <hi>Freedom</hi> for avoiding Occaſions, or reſiſting Temptations
<pb n="3091" facs="tcp:100044:63"/>
to certain ſins; have a Larger meaſure of <hi>Freedom</hi> then others have, to be
humbled under Gods Mighty Hand; which is <hi>in Order the Firſt,</hi> and by
diſpoſition of the Divine Providence, the moſt Available means for attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

                     <hi>Heart.</hi> When he reckons <hi>Laſciviiouſneſs</hi> amongſt the works of the Fleſh, we
muſt not reſtrain this word to <hi>Actual Laſciviouſneſs,</hi> or Laſcivouſneſſe in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt:
We are to extend it to every Degree of this ſin in Word or Thought;
to every Motion of the Tongue, of our Heart, or Senſes, by which either
the Ears or Senſes of others, or our own Souls or Conſciences may be pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted.
When he ſaith, <hi>Idolatry</hi> is a work of the Fleſh, we muſt not take
<hi>Idolatry</hi> only for the Viſible or External Act of Adoration profered either to
Creatures or their Images: It comprehends All inordinate Affection of the
heart to any Creature. For to love Money more then God, then our
Neighbours, or more then Equity or juſt dealing, is a Branch of the <hi>Idolatry</hi>
here mentioned by our Apoſtle. For ſo he interprets himſelf, <hi>Eph. 5. 5. For
this ye know, that no whoremonger, nor unclean perſon, nor Covetous man who
is an Idolater, hath any inheritance in the Kingdom of Chriſt and of God.</hi> Again,
when he reckons <hi>Murther</hi> amongſt the Works of the Fleſh, <hi>We muſt not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
This Monſter only by ſuch Pictures of it, as are drawn in Bloud:</hi> For even
<hi>Hatred, Wrath, Strife,</hi> and <hi>Sedition,</hi> are true Lineaments or live Limbs of
this Gyant. <hi>Ye have heard</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>it was ſaid by them of Old Time,
thou ſhalt not kill, and whoſoever ſhall kill, ſhall be in danger of the Judgment:
But I ſay unto you, That whoſever is angry with his Brother without a cauſe, ſhall
be in danger of the Judgment: And whoſoever ſhall ſay to his Brother</hi> Racha,
<hi>ſhall be in danger of the Councel: But whoſoever ſhall ſay,</hi> Thou Fool, <hi>ſhall be in
danger of Hell fire.</hi> Mat. 5. 21, 22. Laſtly we are not to take the works of the
Fleſh (albeit we take them in the groſſeſt ſenſe) for thoſe Acts, Habits, or
Accuſtomances only, which are ſeated in the Fleſh or Bodily part of man,
but for thoſe Acts or Inclinations which are accompliſhed in the Operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
or Exerciſes of the Reaſonable Soul. For if we mark the Apoſtles
Words; not <hi>Witchcraft</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> only, which are uſually accompliſhed
in ſome External or Bodily Act, but even <hi>Hereſie</hi> it ſelf is expreſly mentioned
amongſt the works of the Fleſh: and yet is <hi>Hereſie</hi> the proper Off-ſpring of
the ſupreme Faculty of the Humane Soul, that is, of the Intellective Faculty
or Underſtanding. The moſt dangerous <hi>Hereticks</hi> have been alwayes men
of great underſtanding, and for wit, acute and ſubtile. Nor are we to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
this word <hi>Hereſie</hi> to profeſt Opinions, or Errors expreſſedly maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
or ſubſcribed unto. We are to extend the Apoſtles meaning unto the
<hi>Firſt Seeds</hi> or <hi>Roots</hi> of this ſin, as to <hi>Emulation,</hi> to <hi>Affectation of applauſe,</hi> to
<hi>Secret pride of heart,</hi> or hearty deſire of <hi>Vain Glory</hi> or Excelling others. Theſe
are the General Seeds of the moſt Groſſe Sins here mentioned. And therefore
our Apoſtle in the Concluſion of this 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> ſtrikes at
the very Root: <hi>Let us not be deſirous of vain glory, provoking one another,
envying one another.</hi> If we harbour theſe or the like deſires, though ſecret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
in our breaſts, they will, as Opportunity ſerves, betray us to the Groſſeſt
Sins here mentioned, as to <hi>Murther,</hi> to <hi>Hereſie,</hi> or the like. Now not of theſe
groſſeſt ſins only, as Murther, Adultery, Hereſie, or Idolatry; but of their
<hi>Firſt Seeds</hi> or Roots, our Apoſtle fore-warnes theſe <hi>Galatians,</hi> as he had
done in times paſt, <hi>that they which do ſuch things ſhall not inherit the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of God,</hi> Gal. 5. 21. And who then ſhall Inherit this Kingdom? For who
is he that is not ſubject to ſome one or other of theſe Miſ-demeanours or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
Inclinations? who is he that doth not either conſent to unlawful Luſt,
or entertain deſires of Applauſe or of Excelling others, or doth not often
either Envy or Emulate his Equals, or Betters? True it is, that no man can
ſay, <hi>His Heart is Clean</hi> in reſpect of theſe Acts, or inclinations unto them.
Shall no man therefore (ſeeing no man is altogether Free from theſe) Enter
<pb n="3099" facs="tcp:100044:67"/>
into the Kingdom of Heaven? God forbid. It is one thing to <hi>Do</hi> ſuch
things according to the ordinary Uſe and conſtruction of this Phraſe in our
vulgar Language; another thing <hi>to be a Doer of Them,</hi> or <hi>to make theſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings
the chiefeſt of our Doings,</hi> which is the meaning of the Holy Ghoſt in
this and like Sayings. So when it is ſaid, <hi>He that doth ſin is the Servant of ſin:</hi>
the meaning is, He that is a <hi>Doer</hi> of that which is ſinful, is the <hi>ſervant of ſin:</hi>
But ſo is not every one that ſinneth, for there is <hi>no man which ſinneth not.</hi>
It is well obſerved by <hi>Maldonate</hi> the Jeſuite, that this word, to <hi>Do</hi> in the
Hebrew Dialect, includes not the <hi>preſent Act</hi> or <hi>Operation</hi> only, but the
<hi>Habit</hi> or Cuſtome of Doing. There is no man which ſometimes <hi>Doth not</hi>
ſome of the works here mentioned by our Apoſtle. And yet there is No
Man which hath <hi>Mortified</hi> the Fleſh, or ſeriouſly intends this work of <hi>Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,</hi>
that <hi>Habitually</hi> or cuſtomarily <hi>Doth Any</hi> of The Works by him mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But this Point will come more fitly to be handled in diſcuſſing the <hi>Second
Branch</hi> or Member of the Firſt of our <hi>Three General Enquiries,</hi> propounded in

it is to be conſidered in Reſpect of the <hi>Perſons</hi> whom this Duty of

uſeful.<note place="margin">☜</note> And no place of Scripture affords a fitter Anſwer to the Queſtion
propoſed, then theſe words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> do. For ſeeing (as He ſaith) the
<hi>works of the Fleſh are manifeſt,</hi> and (as we may adde) in a manner <hi>Evident</hi>
to Every mans Senſe: Every one when he firſt comes to the uſe of Reaſon,
may with more Facility or leſſe Obſervation apprehend the truth and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
of This Duty, then he can do many other Precepts of life which in their
rank and order are neceſſary likewiſe unto Salvation. No point of Belief is
more Evident or ſenſible to the natural man, then the Corruption or imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
of his nature. Some meer naturaliſts (ſuch I mean as knew no
other Article of Chriſtian Faith) have delivered their minds in a manner
Orthodoxally concerning this point, to wit, About <hi>The General Deficiency or
imperfection of Nature in Man.</hi> No Chriſtian man which ſees thus much, but
ſees withall the Enemies againſt whom he is to fight; and may from Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments
in himſelf anſwerable to this Rule of our Apoſtle, perceive a Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
laid upon him, either of killing them, or of being killed by them. Beſides the
apprehenſion of this Neceſſity (which ordinarily inſpires Cowards with Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour)
Every Chriſtian ſtands ingaged by SOLEMN Vow made in Baptiſm, to
undertake this Fight. For the Firſt Branch of THAT TRIPLE Vow, is <hi>To for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
the Devil &amp; all his Works, the Pomps and Vanities of this wicked World, and
all the ſinful Luſts of the Fleſh.</hi> The duty of <hi>Mortification</hi> here injoyned con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in the Performance of this Part of our Vow. And ſeeing this is the firſt
Service unto which we are ingaged by that <hi>Solemn Vow;</hi> the Anſwer to the
Queſtion propoſed by the School-Men muſt be this: <hi>The Firſt Duty where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
every man is tied when he comes to the uſe of Reaſon, is, the Conſideration
of this Duty, and the undertaking of Chriſts Battel againſt the Devil, the World,
and the Fleſh.</hi> The Firſt March or progreſſe, or rather the firſt Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to this Battel, is, the ſerious Apprehenſion of the Neceſſity of <hi>Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Howbeit even <hi>This Preparation</hi> is, though not directly or in expreſs Terms,
yet by neceſſary Conſequence or in Effect, denied by the <hi>Romiſh Church,</hi>
and by ſome others who have profeſſed themſelves Members of the preſent
<hi>Engliſh Church.</hi> For, All they in Effect deny or gainſay the Neceſſity or
Univerſality of this Duty, who teach, that <hi>Original Sin</hi> is utterly taken
away, or that our Regeneration is inſtantly and fully wrought by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Baptiſm. That Children rightly Baptized are truly regenerated by
the Spirit of God, we deny not. And in Caſe being ſo Baptized they die
before they come to the uſe of Reaſon or apprehenſion of <hi>This Duty</hi> here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned,
yet ought we not to doubt of their Salvation, becauſe they have
been Baptized, and by Baptiſm made partakers of Regeneration in ſuch a
Meaſure as is requiſite and ſufficient to their Salvation whileſt they are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants.
But that Original ſin, the Luſts of the Fleſh, or the Old Man ſhould
be <hi>utterly extinguiſhed</hi> or killed in them before their Death, we muſt deny;
Otherwiſe we ſhall Contradict our Apoſtle in this place, and overthrow the
Foundation or Ground whereupon this Precept, or the Neceſſity of this
Duty, is built. Now the Ground or Foundation of this Duty is this: That
<hi>All men</hi> unto whom this Precept is directed (and directed it is to ALL that
are Capable of his meaning) have ſundry deeds of the Fleſh, ſundry Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of the Old Man in them. And if either <hi>Original ſin,</hi> the Reliques of
the Old Man, or Luſts of the fleſh, be to be <hi>Mortified</hi> in <hi>All,</hi> when they firſt
<pb n="3101" facs="tcp:100044:68"/>
come to the uſe of Reaſon: they could not be utterly aboliſhed or dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.
For to kill or <hi>Mortifie</hi> that which is already dead or without all ſenſe
or motion, is impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>4.<note place="margin">Original ſin not utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
                     </note> If <hi>Original ſin,</hi> or the Old Man with his members be utterly extingui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
in young Infants by Baptiſm; I demand, how poſſibly they could revive
in the ſame Parties after they have put off Infancy or Child-hood, or as ſoon
as they come to the uſe of Reaſon. For theſe being killed or extinguiſhed
before, they cannot revive themſelves. Or if children by Baptiſm were
reſtored unto that State of Innocency which our Parents once had: this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency
could not be loſt without ſome Actual Tranſgreſſion, like unto that
tranſgreſſion, by which our Firſt Parents loſt their Innocency or Juſtice
Original. Actually to tranſgreſſe after the ſimilitude of <hi>Adam,</hi> Infants,
whileſt Infants, cannot. For <hi>ſuch Tranſgreſſion conſiſts in a ſinister choice of
the Will;</hi> or in the ill uſe of Reaſon. And all ill Uſe of the <hi>Will</hi> or under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
preſuppoſeth an Uſe of Reaſon, which cannot be in Infants. Again,
there is no Neceſſity, that all Children ſhould actually tranſgreſſe when they
firſt come to the uſe of Reaſon, if before that time they had been Freed
from all <hi>Original Corruption</hi> or Reliques of the Old Man by Baptiſm.
For to lay a <hi>Neceſſity of ſinning</hi> actually, upon any that had been <hi>Freed</hi> from
all <hi>Original ſin,</hi> or reſtored to the ſtate of Innocency which <hi>Adam</hi> had,
were to make God the Author of ſuch Actual Sin. <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf did not
actually ſin upon any <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> but Voluntarily and <hi>Freely.</hi> If the <hi>Firſt Sin</hi>
had not been an <hi>Actual ſin;</hi> or if that Actual ſin had been committed upon <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity:</hi>
not <hi>Adam,</hi> but God had been the Author of it. Certain then it is,
that This Duty of <hi>Mortification</hi> is neceſſary in reſpect of ALL, without any
reſpect of Perſons.<note place="margin">☜</note> Every one at their firſt Arrival unto the Uſe of Reaſon
or at their Paſſage out of Infancy into Youth, are under <hi>This Yoke,</hi> which is no
<hi>Evangelical Counſel,</hi> but a Peremptory Precept. And if This Duty neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
concern ALL at that time: ALL muſt of neceſſity have Original ſin
or ſome Reliques of the Old man in them, yea ſuch ſtrong Reliques as will
impell them to ſome Actual Sin or other, or to ſome tranſgreſſion of ſome
of Gods Commandments, when they come unto the Uſe of Reaſon; Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<hi>This Duty</hi> or precept could not <hi>Vniverſally</hi> concern ALL without Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
For by the Contrary Doctrine, ſome at leaſt, when they firſt
come to the Uſe of Reaſon, ſhould have no Deeds of the Fleſh, which they
were bound to <hi>Mortifie.</hi> Moſt of the <hi>Romans</hi> unto whom our Apoſtle here
writes, had been Baptized after they had come to years of diſcretion. And
Baptiſm without all queſtion had been as Effectual in them, as it hath been
in any other ſince: yet our Apoſtle ſuppoſeth ſome Deeds of the Fleſh to be
in ALL of them, (Even in ſuch as had latelieſt been waſhed in the Laver of
Regeneration) which were to be <hi>Mortified</hi> in them. So that <hi>Baptiſm is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a Sacramental Conſecration of us to undertake this Flight with the works of
our Fleſh, or corruption of our nature, then an utter Extinction or abſolute drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of theſe Enemies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Another neceſſary <hi>Corollary</hi> or Conſequence of this Doctrine there is,
not uſually obſerved by Modern Controverſors; and it is This: <hi>[That the
ſame meaſure of Regeneration which ſufficeth Children or Infants dying before
they come to the uſe of Reaſon, will not ſuffice ſuch as attain to the uſe of Reaſon,
or years of diſcretion.]</hi> For if it did or could, they might be ſaved as Infants
are, without performance of this Duty of <hi>Mortification.</hi> One of theſe Two
muſt neceſſarily be granted, as <hi>Either,</hi> that Children or Infants are not ſo
thorowly ſanctified or regenerated as is neceſſary to Salvation, before the
<pb n="3102" facs="tcp:100044:69"/>
hour of their death, (which no man to my remembrance hath taught:) <hi>Or
elſe,</hi> he that affirms them to be truly regenerated or ſanctified in their Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
muſt yield to us in This; That ſuch Children or Infants as have been
formerly regenerated in a meaſure ſufficient to their Salvation, out-grow
this meaſure of Regeneration or Sanctification after they come to the uſe of
Reaſon or years of diſcretion, as they do their apparel or clothes which were
fit for them whileſt they were Infants. And no queſtion but the Old Man, after
we come to the uſe of Reaſon, grows ſtronger and ſtronger in all of us, untill
we abate his ſtrength, and <hi>Mortifie</hi> his members by the Spirit. Wherefore,
Leaving Children or infants unto the Spirit of God alone who doth Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
them by Baptiſm, and preſerve them in the State of Grace, without
our Miniſtery of Preaching; <hi>This Precept is a Precept of Working Faith:</hi> The
Duty here injoyned is a Duty Neceſſary unto <hi>All</hi> that are of years fit to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed,
or of Capacity to underſtand the Scripture or Rule of Faith ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded
to them. Let us then take his words into a <hi>Second Conſideration.
If ye live after the fleſh,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Of the Nature of the</hi> Fight with our own Bodies <hi>in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>ye ſhall die.</hi> He ſaith not; If ye <hi>have lived</hi> after the
fleſh, ye ſhall die: for this had been rather a certain Prognoſtick of death,
then any medicinal Advice or Preſcript unto his Patients. One man there
was (and no more) who was <hi>Firſt Good and afterwards Bad:</hi> this was the
<hi>Firſt Adam,</hi> Another there is (and no more) who was <hi>Never Bad, alwayes Good:</hi>
this is the <hi>Second Adam, Chriſt Jeſus bleſſed for ever.</hi> Of all the reſt, that is moſt
true, which a Father hath, <hi>Nemo unquam bonus, qui non antè fuit malus; No ſon of
Adam ever proved Good, who was not ſometimes Bad.</hi> The Apoſtles Saying is in
this Caſe true: <hi>Firſt is that which is natural, then that which is ſpiritual,</hi> We,
Even the Elect themſelves, were the ſons of <hi>Adam,</hi> before they were the
Sons of God in Chriſt. All or moſt have lived after the Fleſh, before they
come to live after the Spirit. Thus much our Apoſtles <hi>Second Propoſition</hi>
will infer: <hi>If ye though the ſpirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall Live.</hi>
Inaſmuch as <hi>Mortification</hi> of the Fleſh is neceſſary to <hi>All:</hi> it is preſuppoſed
that <hi>All</hi> have a Fleſh which may be <hi>Mortified,</hi> or a Life of the fleſh; ſeeing
nothing can be <hi>Mortified,</hi> but that which hath Life in it.</p>
                  <p>6. Again, Our Apoſtle ſaith not, <hi>If the Deeds of the Fleſh be Mortified in
you by the Spirit, ye ſhall Live.</hi> For ſo we might happily have dreamed of a
<hi>Mortification</hi> already wrought in us, or to be wrought in us without our
Conſent or Endeavours, as well whileſt we are aſleep as whileſt we are
awaking; Or we might conceive it to have been ſo wrought by the Spirit
in our Cradles, as we might preſume to paſſe the time of our youth in play
and paſtime; Or we might hope to have it ſo fully accompliſhed by the
ſame Spirit alone, in our youth or maturity, as we might ſpend our Old
Age in ſleep, without ſetting a Careful Watch over our Works or thoughts.
His words, if we obſerve them, are thus: <hi>If ye through the Spirit do Mortifie
the Deeds of the Fleſh ye ſhall Live.</hi> So then we ſee, <hi>The Fleſh muſt be Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi>
and <hi>Mortified</hi> it muſt be <hi>By Vs:</hi> Every man muſt <hi>Mortifie</hi> his own
Fleſh, although he cannot <hi>Mortifie</hi> it, but through the <hi>Spirit.</hi> It is <hi>The Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
alone</hi> which giveth Victory: yet this doth not Priviledge us from being
his Souldiers. It is <hi>The Spirit of God,</hi> which works in us The Will and the
Deed: yet this doth not Licence us to be Idle. Fight we muſt, not with
our own ſhadows, but Every man with his own Body; not with a Body
already dead or <hi>Mortified,</hi> but a living Active Body, that may be <hi>Mortified.</hi>
And this diſadvantage we have, that our Adverſaries are got within us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we are aware of them; ſo that we cannot fetch ſuch fierce blows
at them, as may kill them at once, or as we ſay, out of hand. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="3103" facs="tcp:100044:69"/>
our Adverſarie lies ſo cloſe, that we can hardly hurt him without
danger of hurting our ſelves: As ſome by offering too much violence to
their bodies, have enſnared their own ſouls. <hi>But this is no Vſual Fault of this
Age, or of this Nation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. Howbeit, for the Reaſons ſpecified and the like, It is not ſo in this
Combate (which Every man muſt entertain between <hi>himſelf,</hi> and <hi>his own
Fleſh;</hi> or between his <hi>Spirit,</hi> and his <hi>Body:)</hi> as it is in Duels, or ſingle
Combates, <hi>In quibus aut cita mors venit, aut victoria laeta;</hi> in which, one
half hour brings forth either certain death or certain victory to the Comba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant:
Nor as it is in pitch'd Battels, in which, one day is the making or marring
of whole Nations or mighty Kingdoms which have been many years in

or drinking, in ſtrife or variance, or in jeſt or merriment? If ſuch a man
have any ſeeds of Faith, though Moral, it will aſſure him for the Preſent,
that he cannot be ſo much as <hi>Morally Certain</hi> of his Regeneration. The beſt
Advice which for the time being can be given him, is, ſo to mingle his <hi>Hope</hi>
with <hi>Fear,</hi> as that <hi>Fear be Predominant.</hi> If otherwiſe his Hope in this caſe
ſhall bear down Fear, or be not born down by it, there is no other likely hood
but that his <hi>Hope</hi> will grow into ſtiff <hi>Preſumption;</hi> and ſtiff Preſumption
will exclude Repentance, on which Hope, if it be ſure, muſt alwayes
be grounded.</p>
                  <p>2. But moſt mens Conſciences perhaps can truly tell themſelves, that
they do <hi>Mortifie</hi> the Deeds of the Body. Here is Juſt ground of <hi>Hope</hi> and
<hi>Moral Certainty,</hi> if this Teſtimony of the Conſcience be ſincere. Howbeit
even here again, is place for Advice. And the beſt Advice that I can give to
any in this Caſe is, that he do not ſeek to <hi>Buy with one Weight</hi> and <hi>Sell with
another,</hi> but plant his <hi>Hopes</hi> and diſplant his <hi>Fear</hi> by One and the ſame Rule
or Line. The Rule for the planting Hope and preventing Deſpair is this:
When our Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Gal. 5. 21. He that doth ſuch things</hi> (any works of
the Fleſh by him there mentioned) <hi>ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of God:</hi> we
are to take the Value or weight of <hi>This Word</hi> [DOTH] not by the preſent
Acts or Operations, but from the <hi>Vſuall Practiſe,</hi> Habit or Cuſtome of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Continual approved Practiſe, of the leaſt ſins there named by
him, excludes from Grace. This is the Weight or Scale by which men are
willing to ſell, or to put off Fear or Deſpair: But they muſt remember with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
to be as ready to <hi>Buy with the ſame Weight;</hi> that is, as ready to meaſure
their Hopes or entertain the Certainty of their Eſtate in Grace, by the <hi>ſame
Scale.</hi> The Apoſtle ſaith: <hi>If ye mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live.</hi>
From <hi>This General Propoſition</hi> Moſt Hearers of the Word will be ready to
Aſſume: But <hi>I</hi> (God be thanked) <hi>do mortifie the Deeds of the Body</hi> by dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
hearing the word Preached, by frequent receiving of the Sacrament:
Ergo, <hi>I ſhall live.</hi> But here we are to conſider, that as other words imply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Action, ſo this word <hi>[I do Mortifie]</hi> in the Language of the Holy Ghoſt
(ſpecially in thoſe places whereto Gods promiſes are annexed) is not to be
reſtrained to the <hi>Interpoſed Acts</hi> or interrupted Operations of the Spirit, but
directly imports the <hi>Habit,</hi> the Cuſtome, or aſſiduous <hi>Practiſe of Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
If in This Senſe we <hi>Do mortifie</hi> the Deeds of the Body; that is <hi>if we
make This Work the Chief of our Doings;</hi> if moſt of our Care and Induſtry be
addreſſed to the perfecting of this Work: then our <hi>Aſſumption</hi> or minor
Propoſition is Good; and the <hi>Concluſion</hi> will follow, if not <hi>Certitudine
Fidei,</hi> by the Certainty or Full Aſſurance of Faith, yet by <hi>Certain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>y more
then Moral;</hi> by an Aſſurance of Hope. But if we <hi>Mortifie</hi> the Deeds of the
Body only <hi>Now</hi> and <hi>Then,</hi> or <hi>by Fits;</hi> Or if we intend this work but ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
or (as it were) upon the <hi>By:</hi> Then our former <hi>Aſſumption [I do mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the deeds of the Body,]</hi> is <hi>Impertinent,</hi> and will ſooner bring forth <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption,</hi>
then any <hi>Aſſurance of Hope</hi> or Moral Certainty of our Eſtate in
Grace. For Concluſion of this Point; Let every one of us take heed not
to meaſure our Hopes of Regeneration, or Degrees of <hi>Mortification,</hi> by our
readineſſe or deſire to hear the Word Preached, until we have examined
our ſelves; Whether <hi>This Deſire in us be a Deſire of the Spirit, or of the Fleſh?</hi>
Or, Whether it proceed from <hi>True Religion,</hi> or from <hi>Humour or Faſhion of
the place?</hi> Certainly, if this deſire in many, were from the ſpirit, or from
true Religion, it would be more Uniform, and like it ſelf in the Practiſe;
They would be as ready, at leaſt in ſome good Meaſure or Proportion, to
<pb n="3105" facs="tcp:100044:70"/>
frequent Publick Prayers, as to go often unto Publick Sermons. <hi>For
the Faith of Christ can be had no more With Reſpect of Chriſtian Duties, than With
Reſpect or Perſons.</hi> And the ſame Authoritie whether Divine, or Humane or
Eccleſiaſtick from it derived, which injoynes us to hear The Word Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
doth more ſtrictly injoyn us to frequent Publick Prayers, ſpecially in
ſeaſons wherein we are ſpecially required by Authoritie to thank God for
our manifold deliverances from the Meſſengers of his wrath. But from
what cauſe ſoever our deſire of hearing the word Preached proceedeth: Our
backwardneſs in frequenting publick Prayers, without all doubt, ariſeth
from ſome workes of the Fleſh, or Reliques of the Old man which muſt be
Crucified.</p>
                  <p>3. <hi>They that are Chriſts</hi> (ſaith our Apoſtle Gal. 5. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>.) <hi>have crucified the
fleſh with the affections and Luſts.</hi> Take we heed, that none of us argue thus;
<hi>I am Chriſts:</hi> therefore <hi>I have crucified the Fleſh with the Affections and Luſts.</hi>
The Apoſtles meaning is, that the ſafeſt way for us to know whether we be
Chriſts or no, is from this Experiment within our ſelves, <hi>if We have crucified
the fleſh with the affections and Luſts.</hi> But what doth he mean when he ſaith
<hi>[The Affections and luſts must be Crucified?]</hi> Doth he require an vtter Extincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or <hi>Total Mortification</hi> or abſolute death of all carnal Affections and Paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
before we can be aſſured that we are Chriſts? No. Such a <hi>Total Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification</hi>
cannot be hoped for in this Life. We are ſaid to be Crucified to the
world, or to have the Fleſh with the Affections Crucified in us, <hi>Firſt,</hi> By
<hi>Profeſsion</hi> or Conſecration: So all that are Baptized into Chriſt Jeſus, are
ſaid to be <hi>Dead</hi> to Sin, yea to be <hi>Buried</hi> with him by Baptiſme. Rom 6. 2. 4.
<hi>Secondly,</hi> we are ſaid to be Crucified unto the world, or to be Mortified
to the Fleſh, not by Profeſſion only, or Reſolution, but <hi>by Practice:</hi> and
this Crucifying or <hi>Mortification</hi> admits of many <hi>Degrees.</hi>

                           </gap>diviſible,</hi> but of Large Extent.</note> 
                     <hi>Crucifying</hi> taken in its proper Senſe was a moſt Lingring kind of
Death or Torture. And men were ſaid to be crucified from the very Firſt
Moment of their nayling to the Croſs, albeit the conflicts betwixt life and
death were many and ſtrong for divers houres after. Now it is not to be
expected that any of us will be as eager or violent in Crucifying our own
Fleſh, as the Jewes were in crucifying our Saviour. Seing the Partie to
be crucifyed in us is Part of Our Selves, we cannot but uſe it more mildly
and gently, then the Romans did ſuch as they crucified for Malefactors;
whom they would not ſo violently have handled, unleſſe they had firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged
them for no members, or but for rotten and putrified members of
their Body Civil. The leſſe violent the conflict is between the Spirit, and
the Fleſh, or between the Old Man, and the New, the longer will the Old
man live in us; the more frequent and ſenſible his motions will be. And
finally, <hi>as he was born with us: ſo he will die with us;</hi> hardly before us. Yet
may <hi>we be truely ſaid to have Crucified the Old-Man with the Affections and luſts,
from the verie Firſt Time, wherein we begun to nayl them to the Croſs of Chriſt;</hi>
if ſo we ſtill watch them, and ſeek to quell their Motions by the Spirit. They
are dayly crucified by Gods Children, and yet are daily reviving.</p>
                  <p>5. As often as we receive the Sacrament of the Euchariſt with due Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration:
Every remembrance or Meditation of Chriſts Death upon the Croſs,
if it be wrought or managed by the ſpirit, will be as the faſtning of <hi>A New
Nayl</hi> into the Old Man or Body of Sin, which we carry about with us. We
cannot think of Chriſts Death, or of the Cauſes of his Crucifying aright<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but
every thought will be a degree of weakening or enfeebling the Old-Man,
whom we muſt by this and the like meanes dayly weaken, otherwiſe he will
be our Deſtruction.</p>

are <hi>Termes</hi> in their proper Nature <hi>Indefinite,</hi> and ſo uſed by the Holy Ghoſt.
The Actions or Qualifications comprehended, eſpecially under <hi>Converſion</hi>

a<note n="†" place="margin">Converſion, or, Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Spiritual and Moral. See the Note at the end of this Section: or of Chap. 36.</note>

                     <hi>Moral,</hi> or truly <hi>Spiritual.</hi> The <hi>matter</hi> ſignified or imported by theſe
words, <hi>Mortification</hi> and <hi>Converſion,</hi> whether Moral or Spiritual, is <hi>not In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible.</hi>
Whence it is, that we often deceive our ſelves and others, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
one and the ſame Anſwer to All or Moſt Queſtions that are or can be
moved concerning theſe Duties. That may be true of <hi>Mortification</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion

2. But if in the Firſt, Second, or Subſequent Degrees of <hi>Mortification</hi> we
be <hi>meerely Paſsive:</hi> How ſhall we avoyd <hi>That Imputation</hi> which is laid upon
our <hi>Church</hi> by the <hi>Romaniſts?</hi> The Imputation is This: [That albeit we
grant men to be <hi>Mortified,</hi> and require the Dutie of <hi>Mortification</hi> at mens
hands: yet wee acknowledge them not to be Men, but meere <hi>Stocks</hi> in the
Acts or Interims of their Converſion or Mortification.] To this we anſwer;
That although we be <hi>meerly Paſsive</hi> in the Acts of <hi>Mortification:</hi> yet are we
not <hi>Paſsive</hi> after the ſame manner, that Stocks and Stones, or Creatures
meerly Senſitive, are <hi>Paſsive.</hi> Nor are Creatures indued with ſenſe, <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive</hi>
after the ſame manner, that ſtocks and ſtones or creatures without ſenſe,
are. There be <hi>Paſsives</hi> inanimate, <hi>Paſsives</hi> ſenſitive, &amp; reaſonable <hi>Paſsives</hi> or
Patients. Every Faculty of Senſe is <hi>meerly Paſsive</hi> in reſpect of its proper.
Function or Senſation: And yet the ignobleſt Faculties of ſenſe are in <hi>ſome ſort
Active,</hi> that they may be <hi>ſenſitively Paſsive,</hi> or paſsive after another manner,
than ſtocks and ſtones or things inanimate, are. The Senſe of Touching, which
of all the five External Senſes is moſt ignoble and leaſt Active, may not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
be leſſe Paſſive, or more or leſſe capable of paine, by the Activitie or
motion of the bodie. But of the more Noble Senſes the Maxim is moſt true;
<hi>Sentire eſt pati;</hi> All <hi>Senſation is a kind of Paſsion</hi> or ſuffering. And it is generally
reſolved in Schooles that, <hi>Viſio fit intromittendo, non extramittendo;</hi> Sight
or Viſion (although it be the moſt Noble external Senſe) is not made by
<hi>Extramiſsion</hi> or ſending out of the Rayes or beames of the Eye, but by <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsion
of the Obiect</hi> ſeen: and <hi>Impreſsion is a Paſsion.</hi> So that Sight it ſelf
conſiſts in Paſſion; and the Eye it ſelf in reſpect of its proper Function, is
<hi>meerly Paſsive:</hi> and yet he that will ſee the Sun or other Objects Viſible,
muſt be content to open his eyes, not to wink; yet to wink or open the eyes
is no <hi>Paſsion,</hi> but an Action. He that deſires to ſee Objects obſcure or leſſe
Viſible, muſt <hi>Intend the Optick Nerves,</hi> otherwiſe he ſhall not be ſenſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Paſſive.<note place="margin">In what ſence we are ſaid to be <hi>Paſſives</hi> in our <hi>Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                     </note> And He that deſires to hear well, eſpecially if he be afarre off,
muſt be content to <hi>Liſten:</hi> and Liſtning includes an Intenſion of the Organ or
Inſtrument of hearing, an <hi>Action</hi> in the Hearer, that he may be ſenſitively
Paſſive. He that ſpeaks, is the Agent or Actor: And yet how pleaſant ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
his ſpeech be, the Hearer muſt be Active to finde him Eares. Now
<hi>Faith is as the Eye-Sight of the Soul</hi> and underſtanding; and yet <hi>Faith</hi> (as the
Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>comes by hearing.</hi> Our <hi>Mortification,</hi> or Converſion, which is
a work of Faith, is never wrought without ſome ſenſe or feeling. And in
theſe works, if they be ſpiritually performed, the Spirit of man is as <hi>meerly
Paſsive,</hi> as the bodily Eye is in the ſenſe of Sight, or the Eare in the Act
of Hearing; But <hi>meerely Paſsive</hi> after a more remarkable manner in the <hi>Firſt
Degrees of Mortification</hi> or Converſion, than in their Accompliſhment. The
Reſolution then of the former doubt, is This: <hi>We are meerly Paſsive in the
Degrees or works of Mortification or Converſion: We are not meerly Paſsive; we
muſt be Active in ſome works, by the Providence of God preſuppoſed for accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of theſe works,</hi> or for his accompliſhing theſe works in us by the
Spirit.</p>
                  <p>3. For Illuſtration of that which in this Point may be eaſily conceived
by all, without offence (as I hope) to any, We will take for <hi>Inſtance</hi> or <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi>
a man whoſe heart hath never found any internal Comfort of the
Spirit, a Deſpiſer of the Meanes which lead to Grace: <hi>A Young Man</hi> Every
way as diſſolutely Bent, as his yeares and Experience will permit him. This
man upon ſome Loathſome Concomitants which follow ryot, or upon
ſome grievous miſchance that hath befalne him or his Friend in an unruly
<pb n="3108" facs="tcp:100044:72"/>
place upon the <hi>Lords-Day,</hi> abjures the like place and Companie for a while:
And being not able or unaccuſtomed to be alone, reſolves to make trial
whether he ſhall ſpeed better by repairing at times ſeaſonable unto the <hi>Lords
Houſe.</hi> In thus reſolveing and in thus repairing to the Church, he is not
<hi>meerly Paſsive,</hi> but an <hi>Active.</hi> This is no Work of true <hi>Faith,</hi> no Degree of
true Converſion or <hi>Mortification</hi> ſpiritual; yet a Motion by Gods Providence
preſuppoſed or rather prerequired to his future Regeneration or Converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
He is <hi>Active</hi> Likewiſe in Lending his Eares with ſome tolerable atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
unto the Preacher. The <hi>Theme</hi> whereupon the Preacher (without
any notice of this Parties Diſpoſitions or Occaſions) doth inſiſt, we will
ſuppoſe to be that portion of ſcripture which was the meanes of St. <hi>Auſtins
firſt Converſion</hi> to Chriſtianitie, without any choyce made by Him, but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
it ſelf (in reſpect of his preſent thoughts or purpoſe) by meere
Chance. The <hi>Theme</hi> which firſt wrought his Converſion, as he himſelf in
<hi>His Confeſsions</hi> acknowledgeth,<note place="margin">Confeſſ: 8. lib. 12. Cap.</note> was Rom. 13. 13. 14. <hi>Let us walk honeſtly
as in the day, not in Ryoting and Drunkenneſſe, not in Chambering and Wantonneſs,
not in ſtrife and Envying: But put ye on the Lord Jeſus Christ, and make no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion
for the fleſh, to fulfill the Luſts thereof.</hi> A diſcreet methodical applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſuch Doctrines as this Text affords, would much move any diſſolute
<hi>Young-Mans</hi> heart, which had been impelled or drawn upon the former
preſuppoſed Occaſions, to heare theſe Words opened or diſcourſed upon
without his choyce and beyond his Ayme or expectation. And in this ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
Motion or relenting of his heart and Conſcience, the Partie moved
is a <hi>meere Paſsive.</hi> In thus fitting the diſcourſe to his former Life or Cogita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>the Preacher</hi> himſelf is Gods <hi>Inſtrument,</hi> not the <hi>Agent.</hi> He had no
Suffrage in the choyce of his Text, at leaſt in ſuiting it to this Particular
Occaſion, much leſſe any hand or finger in the Iſſue or Succeſſe: Both theſe
are wholy from the diſpoſition of Divine Providence.</p>
                  <p>4. But now that the Parties Heart is touched by theſe or the like Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences,
unexpected either by this Patient or by his phyſitian, doth he ſtill
remaine as <hi>meerly Paſsive</hi> as he was, in the accompliſhment of his <hi>Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
or Converſion? Surely the thoughts of a meere <hi>Natural Civil</hi> or <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi>
man, are <hi>Free</hi> and <hi>Able to Reflect</hi> upon thoſe Motions in reſpect of whoſe
Production his beſt Faculties are <hi>meerely paſsive; Free</hi> and able to <hi>Reviſe</hi>
and work upon thoſe Occurrences and Diſpoſitions of divine Providence,
on which he did not ſo much as think, before they ſet his thoughts on wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.
But ſuppoſing him to be thus <hi>Able,</hi> thus <hi>Free</hi> and willing to <hi>Reflect</hi>
upon his former thoughts, and to <hi>Reviſe</hi> what lately hath befallen him;
Are ſuch <hi>Reflections</hi> able (without <hi>Gods Special Grace</hi> infuſed) to produce any
further Degree of <hi>Mortification</hi> or Converſion?<note place="margin">Men muſt be in ſome ſort <hi>Active,</hi> that They may be <hi>Towardly Paſſive</hi> in the work of <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification.</hi>
                     </note> Or is the Partie thus affected
<hi>meerely Paſsive,</hi> or a <hi>Co-agent</hi> with the Spirit of Grace in the Production of
ſuch farther Degrees of <hi>Mortification,</hi> as ſhall after wards be produced? He
is in my Opinion a <hi>meere Paſsive</hi> in the Production of all Degrees which ſhall
be produced, untill his Converſion or <hi>Mortification</hi> ſhall be accompliſhed.
Are then ſuch <hi>Reflections</hi> upon his former wayes, or Reviſes of what hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen
him for them, to no purpoſe? No man I think will avouch this.
But if to any, to what good purpoſe do they ſerve? ſhall they make him a
more <hi>Towardly Paſsive</hi> in the next Good Motions (which it ſhall pleaſe God
to put into his heart) than he was in the former? Shall he by often thinking
upon his former Courſes, or by abſtinence from evill Company be enabled
ſo to qualifie his Heart, that the ſame or like touches of Gods Providence
ſhall mollifie or affect it more at the <hi>Second time,</hi> than they did at the <hi>First,</hi>
                     <pb n="3109" facs="tcp:100044:72"/>
or at the <hi>Third</hi> more than at the <hi>Second,</hi> or at the <hi>Fourth</hi> more than at the

in this or the like <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> ſo long as we ſtill acknowledge him to
be no more then a <hi>meere Paſsive,</hi> in all the Degrees of his Converſion or
<hi>Mortification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. Notwithſtanding how harmeleſſe ſoever this <hi>Aſſertion</hi> be in it ſelf,

he gives the reaſon in the next words; <hi>For it is God that worketh in you both to

Worketh all, as well the <hi>Will</hi> as the <hi>Deed:</hi> yet it is his Good Pleaſure
to work <hi>Both</hi> only in <hi>them which work with fear and trembling,</hi> as being moſt
affraid to neglect ſo great Salvation as God is readie to work in them, and
for them. And becauſe God never failes to work ſalvation in them and for
them that are diligent in ſeeking it, or affraid to neglect it: therefore they
are ſaid to <hi>Work out their own Salvation,</hi> not properly or <hi>Formally,</hi> but <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutivè:</hi>
that is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Salvation is the <hi>Neceſſary Conſequent</hi> of their working, or
doth neceſſarily follow upon their work, <hi>Not</hi> by any force or Efficacie of
their Work, or <hi>by any natural Connexion, but meerely by Gods Appointment</hi> or
Decree. The very ſame phraſe in the Original our Saviour uſeth unto the
people, John. 6. 27.
Which words can beare no other Conſtruction, then that which we have
made of St. Pauls words Philip. 2. 12. no other Interpretation, then our
Engliſh hath already made: <hi>Labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for
that meat which endureth unto everlaſting life.</hi> And ſo the Vulgar Latin doth
not render them verbatim, <hi>Operamini Cibum,</hi> but <hi>Operamini Cibo;</hi> Not,
<hi>Work that meat,</hi> but, <hi>work for that meat.</hi> For if <hi>That Meat</hi> which endureth
to eternal Life, muſt be given them by the Son of God; <hi>if This Meat</hi> be the
<hi>very Bodie and Blood</hi> of the Son of God: it cannot be the proper <hi>Effect</hi> of any
mans work, or any <hi>Merit</hi> of man; but the <hi>End</hi> or conſequent of our La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
or endeavours; and yet we are ſaid <hi>to work This Meat</hi> in the ſame ſenſe
that we are ſaid to work our Salvation, viz. <hi>Conſecutivè,</hi> becauſe God doth
infallibly make us partakers of it, if we diligently ſeek after it or labour
for it.</p>
                  <p>7. By the right Uſe of this <hi>Diſtinction</hi> we may reconcile many places of
Holy Scripture, which ſeem repugnant one to another; as Likewiſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie
many Speeches, whether of the <hi>Fathers</hi> or ſome Good <hi>Modern Writers,</hi>
which otherwiſe would ſeem harſh and offenſive. <hi>Who can ſay</hi> ſaith Solomon
Prov. 20. 9. <hi>I have made my heart clean?</hi> This Interrogation is in all mens
judgement Equivalent to this Univerſal Negative; <hi>[No man can ſay, I have
made my heart clean.]</hi> Howbeit the Pſalmiſt, Pſal. 73. 13. ſaith, <hi>Verily, I
have cleanſed my heart in vain.</hi> There is no Contradiction between this <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi>
Particular Affirmative <hi>[I have cleanſed my heart;]</hi> and <hi>Solomons</hi> Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
Negative, <hi>[No man can ſay, I have cleanſed my heart.] Solomon</hi> ſpeakes of
the <hi>Internal Purification,</hi> which is the proper Effect and ſole work of Gods
Spirit: The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpeakes <hi>of his own Labours or Endeavours</hi> that his heart
might be thus purified by the ſpirit of God: He then did cleanſe his heart
<hi>Conſecutivè, non Formaliter. Every one</hi> (Saith St. John) <hi>that hath this hope in
him, purifies himſelf, as he is pure.</hi> 1. Joh. 3. 3. This place perhaps Some will
ſay is meant of men Regenerate only, ſeeing they only have that hope
whereof the Apoſtle here ſpeakes. Many other ſuch places of ſcripture
there be, in which we are ſaid, and ſometime Commanded to <hi>Purifie our
Selves: as Jam. 4. 8. Cleanſe your hands ye Sinners, and purifie your hearts ye
double minded.</hi> This place cannot be meant of men truely regenerate: For
<pb n="3111" facs="tcp:100044:73"/>
even Sinners and double minded men, (ſuch as men regenerate are not.) are
commanded to cleanſe their hands and to purifie their hearts. Many other
places likewiſe there be, wherein <hi>this purifying of the heart,</hi> is wholly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed
unto God. <hi>God</hi> (ſaith St. Paul. Act. 15. 9.) <hi>put no difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
us and them, purifying their hearts by Faith.</hi> Not this <hi>Purification</hi> only,
But all other Good Works are ſaid to be wrought by God, as Eſay. 26. 12.
<hi>Lord thou wilt ordaine peace for us: for thou alſo haſt wrought all our workes in
us,</hi> or <hi>for us.</hi> And our Saviour ſaith John. 15. ver. 5. <hi>Without me ye
can do nothing.</hi> Both parts of our former <hi>Distinction</hi> are included in that of
St. Paul. 2. Tim. 2. 21. <hi>If any man purge himſelf from theſe, he ſhall be a
Veſſel unto honour, Sanctified, and meet for the Maſters Vſe, and prepared unto
every good work.</hi> His ſpeech is, if we mark it; <hi>[He ſhall be made a Veſſell
unto honour, if he purge himſelf.]</hi> He doth not ſay; [He ſhall be enabled to
make himſelf a Veſſell of Honour.] Nor doth he in proprietie of ſpeech,
or as we ſay <hi>Formally</hi> or <hi>Efficiently</hi> purge himſelf: But, in that he doth thoſe
things, whereupon, this <hi>Purification</hi> by Gods Spirit doth immediately
follow, <hi>Man is ſaid to purge himſelf.</hi> And ſo are we in this place of St. Paul
Rom: 8. ſaid, <hi>to mortifie the deeds of the bodie by the Spirit,</hi> when we do
thoſe things whereupon this <hi>Mortification</hi> doth immediately inſue, not by
any <hi>Merit</hi> or <hi>Cauſalitie</hi> of our works, but by Gods <hi>meere Grace,</hi> by the
<hi>Councel</hi> of his Holy &amp; irreſiſtible Will, by the <hi>Determination of his Eternal De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree,</hi>
by which it hath pleaſed him to apoint <hi>The One</hi> as a Neceſſarie <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent</hi> of <hi>The Other;</hi> to witt, Spiritual <hi>Mortification</hi> or life it ſelf, as the
Iſſue of our endeavours <hi>to Mortifie the Fleſh.</hi> This kind of Speech is uſual
not in Scripture only, but in other Good Writers, and in our Common
Dialect. So Tully tells us of a Romane Orator, who for want of ſkill in
Civill Law, <hi>Petijt revera ut cauſa caderet;</hi> made a Motion, that he might
Looſe his Cauſe. This <hi>Motion</hi> he did not make directly or <hi>Formally:</hi> His
meaning is, that if his Motion had been granted, he muſt by <hi>Neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent,</hi>
have loſt his Cauſe. Thus when we ſee a man Look Old, whom
we know to be much younger then our ſelves, we uſually ſay; <hi>You make
me an Old Man:</hi> Not hereby meaning, that he hath brought Old-Age or
Gray Haires upon us by any trouble or vexation, but that he, who is much
younger then we, being apparently Old, we muſt by <hi>Conſequence</hi> be Old.
So that he <hi>makes us Old,</hi> not <hi>Efficiently;</hi> but only by <hi>Conſequent</hi> truely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
us to be Old. According to this <hi>Analogie</hi> of Speech by which He is ſaid
<hi>to make us Old,</hi> whoſe Age doth truely argue us to be Old, is that Propheſie
litterally mean<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>, of <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> which was punctually or formally fulfilled
in God or his Chriſt. Jer. 1. 10. <hi>See, I have this day ſet thee over the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and over the Kingdomes, to root out, and to Pull down, and to deſtroy,
and to throw down, to build and to plant. Jeremiah</hi> did never Levie an Armie
or incite any people to take Armes for the Depoſition of their preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour,
or for the Alteration of any ſtate: yet in as much as He foretold
the Extirpation of Some Kingdomes, and the Erection or Plantation of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;
And in as much as what he foretold did certainly come to paſſe, he
is ſaid to have <hi>Done</hi> that which did <hi>Follow upon his Predictions,</hi> though many
yeares after his death. And in the ſame Senſe we are ſaid to <hi>Mortifie the Fleſh,</hi>
to <hi>cleanſe our Hearts;</hi> to <hi>work out our Salvation;</hi> yea to <hi>make our Election
ſure,</hi> when we do thoſe things whereupon our <hi>Purification</hi> or <hi>Mortification</hi>
ſhall be wrought, though many yeares hence; and alwaies wrought by the
Omnipotent Power of that <hi>Decree</hi> by which thoſe Kingdomes were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown,
and others erected in their place, whoſe Erection or Ruine Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah
<pb n="3112" facs="tcp:100044:74"/>
had foretold. Now to inquire, How Man, or his <hi>Free-will,</hi> doth co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate
with Gods ſpirit, in the Firſt, Second, or Third Act of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
is, to my Apprehenſion, a Queſtion not Inextricable onely, but
as Impertinent, as to make a <hi>Philoſophical</hi> or <hi>Political</hi> Search, How <hi>Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>
did concur with God in the Deſtruction of the <hi>Babylonian;</hi> Or <hi>Eſay</hi> with
the ſame God, in the Erection of the <hi>Perſian Empire.</hi> Or more punctually
to our preſent purpoſe: how He that ſhould open another mans mouth that
were unable or unwilling to open it himſelf, and yet ſo deſperately ſick,
that unleſſe he took ſome Phyſical Receipt to remove the matter of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe
or to revive his ſpirits, he ſhould certainly dye, might be truely ſaid
to ſave his Life; yet not to ſave it <hi>Efficienter,</hi> by way of efficiencie, but by
<hi>Conſequence:</hi> that is, becauſe the Phyſick, which without opening his
mouth could have no Operation, did revive or reſtore his wonted health.
And in this ſenſe <hi>Lydia</hi> may be ſaid to have ſaved her own Soul by way of
<hi>Conſequence,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 16. 14.</note> becauſe ſhe opened her eares unto <hi>St. Pauls</hi> Doctrine; and
heard him with attention: which being done, the Lord opened her heart to
feed upon the Word of Life, the only Phyſick of her ſoul. So that the
word of Life, or Chriſt who is the <hi>Eternal Word of God,</hi> did Immediately
and <hi>Formally</hi> open her heart, and ſave her ſoul: But unleſſe ſhe had ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned

<hi>Mortification</hi> (by which our <hi>Election</hi> is made ſure) is Terminated. To
ſay that <hi>Mortification</hi> or <hi>Election</hi> ſhould be, <hi>By,</hi> or <hi>From our works in the
Former Senſe,</hi> that is, from our works as from any <hi>True Cauſe</hi> of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
or, as from any <hi>Merit</hi> or <hi>Title,</hi> that <hi>They</hi> may be produced in us,
is an <hi>Error indeed</hi> deſervedly rejected by moſt Reformed Churches. To
ſay, That <hi>Mortification</hi> or <hi>Election</hi> it ſelf, is <hi>By our works</hi> or <hi>From our works</hi>
in the <hi>Second Senſe,</hi> that is, <hi>tanquam ex Termino, as from a Term</hi> or Object
without whoſe Preſence or Coexiſtence God doth not work or accompliſh
our <hi>Mortification</hi> by his Spirit, nor admit us into the Eſtate of the <hi>Elect;</hi>
This is <hi>no Error,</hi> but an <hi>Orthodoxal Doctrine</hi> voyd of all danger. For it Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
granted, (which is as much as can be demanded) that <hi>Mortification</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
is a work of <hi>Creation,</hi> and proper only unto God; yet even <hi>Creation</hi>
it ſelf, taken in the ſtricter Senſe, was <hi>ex Termino praeviſo,</hi> from ſome <hi>Term,</hi>
though not out of any <hi>Cauſe</hi> or matter praeexiſtent. For when we ſay,
that God <hi>Created</hi> the heavens and earth of <hi>Nothing,</hi> that is, out of no <hi>Matter
Praeexiſtent;</hi> we neceſſarily include, that this <hi>Nihilum</hi> or <hi>Nothing,</hi> was the
<hi>Negative Term</hi> of this <hi>Creation.</hi> Logical Poſſibility, that is whatſoever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
no Contradiction, is the Object of Omnipotencie; and <hi>Creation</hi> it ſelf
is the Reduction of ſuch Poſſibilitie into Act or Real Effect. If there had been
any thing beſides God, praeexiſtent to this work of <hi>Creation;</hi> or unleſſe
<hi>Nothing</hi> had been praecedent, (not praeexiſtent) to all things that <hi>are,</hi> or
have Exiſtence, there could have been no ſuch <hi>Creation,</hi> as we beleive
there was, of the heaven and of the Earth; or, of the Firſt Maſſe, out of
which all things were made.</p>
                  <p>2. But Herbs and Graſs were not made out of meere <hi>Nothing,</hi> as the
Heaven and Earth were. For they were made of the Earth, as it is Gen:
1. 11. <hi>God ſaid Let the Earth bring forth Graſſe, the herb yeilding ſeed, and
the fruit tree yeilding fruit after his kind.</hi> He did not in this ſort Say, <hi>Let
Nothing bring forth the heavens and the earth:</hi> For ſo <hi>Nothing</hi> ſhould have
been <hi>Somthing.</hi> Or if God had made herbs and graſs after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
that he made the heavens and the Earth, we could not ſay, that they
had been made of the Earth: For ſo the Earth ſhould have been <hi>Nothing.</hi>
And yet the making of graſs and herbs out of the earth, was a true and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<hi>Creation:</hi> becauſe, although God did make them of the Earth; yet he
made them not of the earth <hi>Tanquam ex materiali Cauſa,</hi>

determine to make them, but out of the Earth; not of the Water or other
Element; as he made the Fiſhes of the water, not of the earth. So that
<pb n="3114" facs="tcp:100044:75"/>
graſs was made of the earth; and fiſhes, of the Sea, not as of any Cauſe
concurrent to their making or production, but <hi>tanquam ex Termino aut Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecto

day, were not from the time of their Creation ſo much as a material Cauſe
of the Fry or Spawn which proceeded from them, untill God beſtowed his
Bleſſing upon them, ſaying: <hi>Be fruitfull, and multiply, and fill the waters
in the ſeas.</hi> The Effect of this Bleſſing was a true and proper <hi>Creation:</hi> For
hereby they became in their kinds Efficient and material Cauſes. And from
this Bleſſing they received the firſt Poſſibilitie of Propagation or continuance
of their kind, by ſucceſſion or generation of the like. Admitt then our

praeexiſtent, though not poſitively concurring to their Creation or Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>working

<hi>Mortification,</hi> or to Create Life in ſuch as are capable of Reaſon, untill
ſome works which he requires, be done by them; albeit the beſt works
which any can do, be as little Conducent by way of <hi>Cauſalitie</hi> or Title to the
production of Life or <hi>Mortification</hi> Spiritual, as the Red Earth was to the
Creating of <hi>Adam,</hi> or <hi>Adam</hi> in a dead ſleep was, to the Creation of <hi>Eve.
Adam</hi> was the ſole work of God, and ſo was <hi>Eve,</hi> though made of <hi>Adam;</hi>
aſwell as the heaven and the earth, were the ſole works of God. And ſo
is our <hi>Election;</hi> ſo is our <hi>New Life;</hi> ſo is our <hi>Mortification</hi> ſpiritiual, as true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and intirely the work of God, though not wrought without ſome works

they have no workes praeexiſtent. And as <hi>Adam,</hi> though <hi>Eve</hi> was
made of him, had no more ſhare with God in her <hi>Creation,</hi> than <hi>Nothing</hi>
had with Him in the <hi>Creation</hi> of the heavens and the Earth: So neither have
we, after we have done the works required to <hi>Mortification</hi> any greater
ſhare or Title, of <hi>Cauſalitie</hi> in the production of Life or <hi>Mortification</hi> Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al,

                  <p>4. It may be <hi>Objected,</hi> That the works prerequired by us to <hi>Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
ſpiritual, are more truely <hi>Ours,</hi> than any Action that can be imagined
as requiſite in the heavens for Creation of the Sun, Moon, or Starres; Or

are required in us,<note n="*" place="margin">See the 2. note at the end of this Sect: chapt: 36.</note> that Grace may be created in us; yet not to make

of it, or not <hi>Poſitively Contradictorie</hi> to his Majeſtie or eternal aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
Man from the beginning had a <hi>Freedome of Will</hi> to deprive himſelf of
ſuch Bleſſings, as God in his Bounty had provided for him. Our firſt Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
by the Abuſe of their <hi>Free Will</hi> betwixt Good and Evill, made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues
uncapable of any Bleſſing or Reward from Gods <hi>Juſtice</hi> or meer <hi>Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie:</hi>
yet were they not hereby made uncapable of his <hi>Infinite Mercy.</hi> Nor
are his Poſteritie made uncapable of it by Sin meerely Original, but by A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe
of that <hi>Free-Will</hi> which is left them as the proper Fruit of Sin Original,
that is, a <hi>Free-Will to do Evill.</hi> We have a Power or <hi>Freedome</hi> left us to
make our ſelves more Uncapable of Gods Mercy, than we were in <hi>Adam;</hi>
no Power at all to make our ſelves more Capable of it; it is God alone
which increaſeth this Capacitie in us. That of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> is notwithſtanding
moſt true in reſpect of All that are come to years of diſcretion; <hi>Deus qui fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit
te ſine te, non ſalvabit te ſine te;</hi> God which made thee without any en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of thine own, will not ſave thee without thine own endeavours.
And yet the beſt of our endeavours are but to keep our ſelves in the ſame
ſtate wherein we were when we had no works, no endeavours, that is, when
we were Infants. And happie is he that doth not by lewd endeavours or
ill works,<note place="margin">☜</note> evacuate the Fruits of Baptiſme in himſelf. For him that doth
finally ſo (Caſſate or) <hi>Voyd</hi> them, it had been better if he had never been
baptized, if he had never been born. For by fruſtrating the hopes which he
had in Baptiſme, he makes himſelf more uncapable of Gods mercy for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
the Spirit of Life created in him, than the Earth was of Gods Power to
have Man created of it.</p>

an Abilitie to <hi>Mortifie</hi> his own Fleſh, or to <hi>Free</hi> himſelf from the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude</hi>
of the Fleſh. <hi>Theſe</hi> and the <hi>like Inconveniences</hi> have perſwaded ſome,
to attribute this whole work unto the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> which is able to do all
things without the Coagencie or Conſort of the <hi>Spirit of Man.</hi> But thus
to avoyd the former <hi>Inconveniences,</hi> is but as if a man having found a Way
out of a thicket of <hi>Thornes,</hi> ſhould inſtantly intangle himſelf in the Bryars.
For it is not ſo Great a <hi>Solaeciſme,</hi> to ſay; <hi>That the Spirit of Man, or man
himſelf ſhould be an Agent in this buſineſſe.</hi> As to Affirme <hi>That,</hi> whence it
would follow, that <hi>The Spirit of God ſhould in this work of Mortification, be
mans Inſtrument.</hi> For that which Man worketh <hi>by the Spirit.</hi> Man is more
properly ſaid to work it, then <hi>the Spirit.</hi> Now our Apoſtle ſaith that we
muſt <hi>mortifie the deedes of the Body:</hi> And he that <hi>Mortifieth</hi> is the <hi>Agent:</hi>
That by which we work this <hi>Mortification,</hi> is but our <hi>Inſtrument.</hi> And
<pb n="3116" facs="tcp:100044:76"/>
better it were to ſay, That the <hi>Spirit of Man</hi> ſhould be <hi>mans Inſtrument</hi> in
this work, rather than the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. It were according to our <hi>Former Principles</hi> eaſily anſwered, that
<hi>Wee, by Our ſpirit, Mortifie</hi> the Deedes of our Bodies <hi>Conſecutivè, non For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maliter
aut Efficienter,</hi> that is, not by any Efficacie in us, or Influence de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivable
from us: The Spirit of God muſt directly work or Effect it. But
though this be <hi>True:</hi> yet is it <hi>not Punctual</hi> to the point propoſed. For by
this Anſwer the <hi>Spirit</hi> here meant ſhould only be the <hi>Spirit of man:</hi> For by
<hi>this Spirit</hi> only we work our <hi>Mortification Conſecutivè.</hi> That which the
<hi>Spirit of God</hi> doth work in us, it works <hi>Directly, Immediatly, and Entirely:</hi>
and in produceing its proper Effects it hath no Partner or Co-Agent. It
may notwithſtanding be yet further replyed, that we muſt <hi>Mortifie</hi> the
Fleſh by the <hi>ſpirit of God,</hi> not as by any <hi>Inſtrumental Cauſe</hi> ſubordinate to
us, but in ſuch a ſenſe as we ſay; Inferiour Magiſtrates do the Acts of the
Magiſtracie by the Kings or Supreme Magiſtrates Authoritie, unto which
they and their Magiſtracie are Subordinate. Thus ſome good<note n="*" place="margin">Paſqualius.</note> Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
upon this place ſay, that we muſt <hi>Mortifie</hi> the Fleſh <hi>by our own Spirit,</hi>
but, by our <hi>own Spirit,</hi> as it is <hi>Subordinate</hi> to the <hi>Spirit of God:</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently
to this Aſſertion it muſt be granted, that this <hi>Subordination</hi> of our
<hi>Spirit</hi> to the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> is in this place neceſſarily included or perſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
though not expreſſed by our Apoſtle. All this (for ought I know)
may be moſt True and <hi>Orthodoxal,</hi> but withall too <hi>General.</hi> For, Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
or ſubordinate Magiſtrates are more properly ſaid to be the <hi>Agents,</hi>
Even in thoſe things which they do by the Authoritie and warrant of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours:
whereas the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> is not only the <hi>Author</hi> or ſole <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zer,</hi>
but the <hi>Principal Actor</hi> or Agent in this work of <hi>mortification.</hi> For a
more particular and punctual Reſolution of the Queſtion propoſed, we are
to unfold the divers acceptions of theſe Words or Termes, to wit [THE
SPIRIT] and [MORTIFICATION.]</p>
                  <p>3. There is the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> and there is <hi>the Spirit of man:</hi> Both of
them have their ſeveral and divers Importances in ſcripture. The <hi>Spirit of
man</hi> may be conſidered, as it is in the <hi>Natural Man,</hi> or in the man altogether
unregenerate; and <hi>This Spirit</hi> is at <hi>Enmitie</hi> with God: or, in the <hi>Man</hi> as
yet unregenerate, yet <hi>in the way to Regeneration;</hi> And <hi>the Spirit of this man</hi>
is <hi>privatively oppoſite</hi> to <hi>the Spirit of God;</hi> ſo, as Darkneſſe is to Light;
Blindneſſe to Sight, or Death to Life. There is <hi>a Spirit</hi> likewiſe in the
man <hi>Regenerate,</hi> the ſame for Subſtance with <hi>the Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Natural</hi> Man;
the ſame for Subſtance that it was in himſelf before Regeneration, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in Qualitie: And, <hi>This Spirit,</hi> though it ceaſe not to be in man, yet
is it not uſually called, <hi>The Spirit of Man,</hi> as being no way oppoſite unto
<hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> but Subordinate unto it; ſo Subordinate, unto it, that it is
called, The <hi>Spirit that is of God,</hi> and ſometimes, <hi>The Spirit of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Theſe diverſe Acceptions of the word [SPIRIT] as likewiſe the
Diſtinction or Oppoſition between <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> and <hi>the Spirit of man,</hi>
are ſet down by our Apoſtle. 1. Cor. 2. from the ninth verſe unto the
end of the Chapter. <hi>What Man knoweth the things of a man, ſave the Spirit
of man which is in him? Even ſo the things of God knoweth no man, but the
Spirit of God. ver.</hi> 11. He doth not ſay, the ſpirit of God <hi>which is in God,</hi> or
<hi>with</hi> God. And when He ſaith, <hi>[What man knoweth the things of man,
ſave the Spirit of Man?]</hi> he ſuppoſeth there is even in the Natural and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
Man, <hi>a Spirit,</hi> able to diſcerne the ſecret thoughts and imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of his heart, though blind and ignorant in the things concerning God.
<pb n="3117" facs="tcp:100044:76"/>
Againe, when he ſaith <hi>[the things of God knoweth no man:]</hi> he excludeth
the Natural man only, or the man to whom God hath not imparted the
Gifts of <hi>the Spirit.</hi> For ſo he hath ſaid ver. 9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor Ear
heard, neither have entred into the heart of man the things which God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared
for them that love him.</hi> Into <hi>What Mans</hi> heart have they not entred?
Or, unto <hi>What Man</hi> doth this Negative belong? Only to the Natural or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate
Man. For ſo he adds, verſe 10. <hi>But God hath revealed them unto
us by his Spirit: For the Spirit ſearcheth all things, yea, the deep things of
God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. What <hi>Spirit</hi> is this which ſearcheth all things, Even the deep things
of God? the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> which is <hi>without Vs,</hi> or which communicateth
knowledge and reveales things hidden unto us? If <hi>this Spirit</hi> were here
meant, How ſhould thoſe <hi>deep things of God</hi> be revealed unto us? Revealed
to us they cannot be, unleſſe they be known by us: and known by Us they
cannot be, but by <hi>the Spirit</hi> which is in us. So he adds more expreſsly, Ver.
12. <hi>Now we have received not the Spirit of the world,</hi> (that is, the Spirit
which is of man) <hi>but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things
that are freely given to Vs of God.</hi> If by <hi>the Spirit</hi> which we have received,
we know the things which are freely given to us of God: <hi>This Spirit</hi> muſt
be made <hi>Ours;</hi> it muſt be <hi>One with Our Spirit;</hi> it is not <hi>the Spirit of God</hi>
which is <hi>Without Vs,</hi> or which works our Regeneration, but <hi>the Spirit</hi> by
which we become formally Regenerate and Spiritual. And Punctually to
this purpoſe the Apoſtle haveing ſaid ver. 14. <hi>The Natural Man receiveth
not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſſe unto him: Neither can
he know them</hi> (ſo long as he remaines a Natural Man) <hi>becauſe they are Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
diſcerned:</hi> he adds by way of oppoſition, ver. 15. 16. <hi>But he that is
Spiritual judgeth</hi> (or <hi>diſcerneth) all things, Yet He himſelf is judged of no man.
For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may inſtruct him? But we have
the mind of Chriſt.</hi> When He ſaith [WEE <hi>have the mind of Chriſt,]</hi> he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludeth
ALL ſuch as He was, that is, All Men truely Regenerated by <hi>the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
whom God hath inſtructed to diſcern the things of God. By <hi>[The
Mind of Chriſt]</hi> the Apoſtle meaneth the ſelf ſame thing that he did, by <hi>the
Spirit of God.</hi> Between the <hi>mind of Christ</hi> communicated unto us, and the
<hi>Spirit of God</hi> communicated unto Us and received by Us, there is no diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
or diſtinction: The importance of both Speeches is the ſame. Our
mind being Changed from Evill to Good, or from minding of Carnal things
to the minding of Spiritual things, is called, <hi>The mind of Chriſt by Participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
&amp; ſo likewiſe <hi>The Spirit of God by Participation.</hi> But <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> which
communicates this Mind or Spirit unto us, or by which we are ſaid to receive
it, hath not alwayes the ſame Importance: Between the Importances there is
<hi>no Diſſention,</hi> yet <hi>a Diſtinction.</hi> Sometimes by <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> God the Spirit
or <hi>God the Holy Ghoſt is meant,</hi> who in a peculiar manner is ſaid to <hi>ſanctifie</hi> Us,
to Regenerate Us, to Quicken Us, to work <hi>Mortification</hi> in Us. Sometimes
again by <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> is meant, <hi>The Spirit</hi> which is in Chriſt, which is the
Fountain from whence all gifts of <hi>the Spirit</hi> are immediatly derived unto
us, though the derivation be immediately wrought by the Holy Ghoſt. And
when the Apoſtle ſaith, that we have <hi>the mind of Chriſt:</hi> this Mind of Chriſt
which we have received, ſuppoſeth <hi>a Mind or Spirit</hi> in Chriſt which partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pates
it unto us, or from which we receive it by Participation. We may
not imagine a <hi>Tranſmigration</hi> or <hi>Tranſmiſſion of the Spirit</hi> which is in Chriſt
from Him to Us, but a <hi>Participation only.</hi> God hath anoynted him with
the Oyle of gladneſſe above his Fellowes. God giveth not <hi>the Spirit</hi> by mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
<pb n="3118" facs="tcp:100044:77"/>
to him. From the fulneſſe of <hi>this Spirit</hi> in him, we receive <hi>Grace for
Grace;</hi> Albeit this Grace be diſtributed or Portioned out unto Us by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt. Chriſt ſends <hi>the Spirit of Mortification</hi> or Regeneration into our
hearts as the Fountain or Conduit head doth the water into a Citie: The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Ghoſt prepares our hearts to receive <hi>this Spirit</hi> of Chriſt, and brings it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Us, after ſuch a manner as He that makes the <hi>Aquaeducts</hi> or Conduit
pipes, doth convey water into a Town or Citie, otherwiſe deſtitute of
good water.</p>
                  <p>6. But what doth the Apoſtle mean by the <hi>Spirit of man,</hi> as it is Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinct
or oppoſite to <hi>the Spirit of God?</hi> the whole <hi>Reaſonable Soul</hi> or
Form of man by which he is diſtinguiſhed from other Creatures? Or <hi>ſome
principal part</hi> which hath leaſt commixture with the Fleſh, or Body, that
which we commonly call the <hi>Conſcience?</hi> This part of the Soul even in the
unregenerate man oft times diſallowes ſuch things as are entertained by the
Reaſonable Soul, and condemnes ſuch Actions as are undertaken by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
and mannaged with Extraordinary underſtanding. <hi>When the Gentiles</hi>
(ſaith our Apoſtle) <hi>do by Nature the things contained in the Law, they ſhew the
work of the Law written in their hearts, their</hi> CONSCIENCE <hi>alſo bearing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and their thoughts accuſing or elſe excuſing one another, Rom.</hi> 2. 14.
15. In this Accuſation or <hi>Proceſſe</hi> in the very Heathen, there is a Combate
or Conflict between <hi>the Spirit</hi> and <hi>the Fleſh,</hi> or between <hi>the Mind</hi> and the
<hi>Affections.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. But may not the ſame part or Facultie of the Reaſonable Soul diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
or Condemn at one Time the ſelf ſame things, which at another
time it well approves? If it may, there is no Neceſſitie of Diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<hi>the Soul,</hi> and <hi>the Spirit.</hi> But if there be any Conflict between Reaſon
it ſelf, and <hi>the Spirit,</hi> at one and the ſame time; there muſt needs be a
Diſtinction betwixt them. Now it ſeemes, that even whilſt the Reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Soul doth contrive miſchief, or give her Conſent to things unjuſt or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expedient,
whilſt it Hatcheth Haereſie, the <hi>Conſcience</hi> doth ſecretly check it,
and endeavour to reſtrain it. And this, <hi>Conſcience</hi> could not do, unleſſe it
were in ſome ſort diſtinct from that Reaſonable part or Facultie of the Soul
which is indued with <hi>Freedome of Will.</hi> For there can be no Conflict but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
two different Parties or Capacities.</p>
                  <p>8. This is moſt Conſequent to <hi>Plato's Philoſophie,</hi> and to true <hi>Theologie.</hi>
For as the Platonicks diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Soul</hi> and the <hi>Mind:</hi> So our
Apoſtle diſtinguiſheth between the <hi>Soul of man,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit of Man.</hi> 1.
Theſs:<note place="margin">The <hi>Spirit of man</hi> is not ſaid to be <hi>mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> but <hi>Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened</hi> by the <hi>Spirit of God.</hi>
                     </note> 5. 23. <hi>And the very God of Peace ſanctifie you wholly: and I pray
God your whole ſpirit and Soul, and Body, be preſerved blameleſs unto the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Our Sanctification is not entire or univerſal in
reſpect of the <hi>Parts,</hi> (univerſal it cannot be in reſpect of all <hi>Degrees,)</hi> untill
the <hi>Soul</hi> as well as the <hi>Spirit,</hi> untill the <hi>Body</hi> as well as the <hi>Soul</hi> be thus Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,
as our Apoſtle wiſheth. Every part of man muſt be <hi>in Part</hi> or in ſome
good meaſure Sanctified. But before this entire or whole <hi>Sanctification</hi> can
be wrought, there muſt be a <hi>Mortification</hi> of the Body or of the Fleſh: and
under <hi>The Fleſh</hi> (as hath been obſerved before) <hi>The Reaſonable Soul with its
best Faculties, is uſually comprehended</hi> by our Apoſtle. Howbeit we do not
read of any <hi>Mortification</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> but of <hi>Renovation, Vivification,</hi> or
Quickening of it.</p>
                  <p>9. What ſhall we ſay then? That the <hi>Spirit</hi> or conſcience of man is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together
free from the Contagion of the <hi>Fleſh?</hi> that it ſtands in no need of
<hi>Mortification?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 8. 7.</note> St. Paul tells us, of ſome men, whoſe <hi>Conſcience being Weak is
<pb n="3119" facs="tcp:100044:77"/>
defiled.</hi> But <hi>the Conſcience</hi> in his Language perhaps is not altogether the ſame
with <hi>the Spirit:</hi> But the <hi>Syntereſis,</hi> in all likelyhood, <hi>is.</hi> And again He tells
us, that there be men <hi>of Corrupt minds, and deſtitute of the truth, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that Gain is Godlineſs.</hi> 1. Tim: 6. 5. And we read of a <hi>Soundneſſe of
mind,</hi> 2. Tim. 1. 7. But that defilement or corruption of <hi>the Spirit</hi> or mind,
Seemes by our Apoſtle not to be <hi>Ordinary.</hi> However <hi>the mind</hi> or Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
may be polluted by the Contagion of <hi>the Fleſh;</hi> yet are they not ſo ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dically
polluted, as the Fleſh is. <hi>The Fleſh is the ſeat of the diſeaſe.</hi> The <hi>Idi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opathy</hi>
(as Phyſitians ſpeak) is in <hi>The Soul;</hi> the <hi>Sympathy</hi> only in <hi>the Spirit</hi>
or Conſcience: So that <hi>if the deeds of the Fleſh be mortified, there needs no
peculiar Cure or Mortification of the Spirit.</hi> So it falls out in diſeaſes of the
Bodie. If the <hi>Protopathie</hi> be cured, the <hi>Sympathy</hi> will fall of it ſelf: As ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
are vexed oft times with great Aches or pains in the Head; Some with
Fitts of the <hi>Epilepſie</hi> or Falling-Sickneſſe, when as the root of the diſeaſe is
in the Stomack. In theſe Caſes there needs no peculiar Phyſick for the Head:
But cure the Stomack, and the Head will recover without further medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine.
From this <hi>Analogie</hi> or proportion betwixt the diſeaſes of the Soul,
and of the body, it is (I take it;) that <hi>we are not injoyned to mortifie the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
For the Apoſtle ſuppoſeth, that the Fleſh being <hi>mortified,</hi> the Cure is
wrought, without any <hi>peculiar Mortification</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> diſtinct from it.
Or rather, He ſuppoſed and knew, that the <hi>mortification</hi> of the Fleſh could
not be wrought without <hi>Renovation</hi> or Quickening of the <hi>Spirit.</hi> For
though it be true which ſome Moraliſts ſay, <hi>Mens deprecatur ad optima,</hi> that,
<hi>The Spirit or Conſcience doth as it were intreat and counſel Malefactors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
unto that which is Good:</hi> Yet the <hi>Spirit</hi> and Conſcience of the beſt men
before they be renewed by the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> doth perform this work but
<hi>Weakly, Sleightly,</hi> or <hi>Cowardly.</hi> And the Reaſon, why the <hi>Spirit</hi> or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of men, of good men in reſpect of others, is ſo defective in this
performance of its proper Function, is only becauſe it is overborn, or kept
under, or in part corrupted by Carnal Affections or contrary inclinations
of the Body or fleſh, which for this Reaſon, muſt be <hi>mortified.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Apoſtle, when He exhorts to <hi>put off the Old Man which is corrupt
through the deceitfull Luſts;</hi> injoynes them to <hi>be renewed in the Spirit of their
Mind.</hi> Ephe. 4. 22. 23.</p>
                  <p>10. There is a <hi>Twofold Mortification:</hi> The <hi>One</hi> conſiſts in the weake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
deading, or benumming of Carnal Affections or Deſires: The <hi>Other</hi> is
alwayes wrought and perfected by a Poſitive Purification of the Heart or
Fountain, whence the Affections flow. A man may ceaſe to be unchaſt or
Laſcivious by age or other Caſual Impotencie: So may a man ceaſe to be
drunk, by ſome diſeaſe or diſtaſt. Another may ceaſe to be Ambitious,
or have his Ambitious deſires benummed or weakened, as being either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved
of opportunities to raiſe his Fortunes, or diſenabled to follow his
Suites or hopes of Preferment. <hi>Mortification is then perfect, when the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
it ſelf is as it were reſcued from the Carnal Deſires or Delights wherein it was
involved, and is won or trayned to the Service of the Spirit.</hi>

                  <p>1. THe Queſtion remaines <hi>[How theſe Two ſorts of mortification are
wrought by The Spirit or by Vs?]</hi> To this Diſquiſition concerning the
Cure of the Soul, there is a Queſtion very Pertinent amongſt the
<hi>Phyſitians</hi> of the Body.<note place="margin">Whether the Cure of mens Souls be wrought by <hi>Contraries,</hi> or <hi>Symbolicals.</hi>
                     </note> One ſort ſayes, <hi>Omne Remedium fit per Contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um:</hi>
The Others ſay, <hi>Omne Remedium fit per Simile.</hi> The Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
them may be eaſily reconciled with the <hi>Diſtinction</hi> of the <hi>Infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties</hi>
and Diſeaſes which are to be cured, or of the <hi>Subject</hi> whereunto the
ſaid Medicine may be ſaid to be <hi>Like, Diſlike,</hi> or <hi>Contrarie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. The Medicine may be ſometimes <hi>Contrarie</hi> to the <hi>Matter</hi> of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe,
but <hi>Like</hi> unto the <hi>Nature</hi> oppoſed. Sometimes again, the Medicine
may be <hi>Contrary</hi> to the <hi>Nature,</hi> but <hi>Agreeable</hi> with the <hi>matter</hi> of the Diſeaſe
wherewith Nature is oppoſed. Some Diſeaſes properly conſiſt in meer
weakneſſe of Nature or Languiſhment of Spirit: and theſe muſt be cured
<hi>per Simile,</hi> by adminiſtration of ſuch Diet or Receipts as may immediatly
comfort the Fountain of Life, which conſiſts <hi>in Calido &amp; Humido,</hi> in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
heat and moyſture. As for this reaſon, <hi>Hot-waters</hi> to men in <hi>Swounds</hi>
are fitteſt; and warm Brothes or Cordials, to men otherwiſe Feeble, or
deprived of heat and moiſture. Other Diſeaſes conſiſt either in Exceſſive
Heat, or abundance of Blood: and theſe muſt be cured <hi>by the Contrarie,</hi> as
by opening a Veine, or by cooling Diet, or medicines. Too much fulneſſe
of Body cannot be holpen, but by abſtinence, or Evacuation. However,
both ſorts of <hi>Phyſitians</hi> agree, that when all is done <q>
                        <hi>Nature is the beſt
Phyſitian;</hi> and that is the beſt Phyſick which ſetts Nature Free, to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe
her own ſtrength; or Strengthens her to expell noyſom humours,
which cloy or moleſt her.</q> But oft times it ſo falls out, that Nature can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be thus freed of bad Humors which are ſetled in the Body, without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration
of ſome thing that is <hi>Contrary</hi> unto Nature, but <hi>Conſorteth</hi> ſo
well with the Humors which oppreſſe her, that <hi>Nature</hi> being inforced to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
this <hi>In-mate</hi> or New-Comer, doth with the ſame force expell a ſecret
or domeſtick Enemie which had aſſociated himſelf unto it: As ſometimes
the Law cannot proceed againſt ſecret Enemies of the ſtate, untill they be
drawn to aſſociate or joyn themſelves to other apparent forrain Enemies,
with whom they periſh or are expelled their Native Countrey together
with them. Again, although the Conflict be alwaies moſt eager and keen
between <hi>Natures moſt Contrarie:</hi> yet that which every <hi>Contrarie</hi> Agent doth
in the firſt place aym at, is, not utterly to deſtroy its Oppo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ite, but to
make it like it ſelf; albeit the one often come to deſtroy the other by ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to make it grow like it ſelf. The heat of the fire doth not directly aym
or ſtrike at the cold in the water, but ſeekes to communicate its own heat
unto it: and the heat produced in the water, doth immediatly and directly
expell the cold, and at length conſume the ſubſtance of water.</p>
                  <p>3. For better explicating <hi>the Manner,</hi> how both kinds <hi>of Mortification</hi> are
wrought by <hi>the Spirit;</hi> Or how they are wrought by the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> how
by the <hi>ſpirit of man,</hi> or by the <hi>ſpirit which is in Man;</hi> Or how by <hi>Contraries,</hi>
                     <pb n="3121" facs="tcp:100044:78"/>
How by <hi>Similitude:</hi> we are in the Firſt place to conſider <hi>Three Eſtates</hi> or
Conditions <hi>of Men:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">How the <hi>Cure</hi> of the Soul is wrought in ſeverall <hi>ſorts</hi> or Conditions of men.</note> The <hi>Firſt,</hi> of the Natural Man; that is, of him which as
yet is in no ſort partaker of the <hi>ſpirit of God,</hi> which hath had no touch or feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of its Operation in him or upon him. The <hi>Second</hi> is, of men which have
been partakers of <hi>the Spirit,</hi> but, as we ſay, <hi>in Fieri,</hi> not <hi>in Facto;</hi> Such as
feele the motions of Gods Spirit whileſt it moves them; that is, they are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of its <hi>Motions</hi> or touches, but not of its <hi>Reſidence</hi> in them or of any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent
Impreſſion made upon them. The <hi>Third Sort,</hi> is, of men made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of the <hi>Spirit in Habit,</hi> that is, (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) they have the
<hi>Spirit dwelling in them,</hi> and are enlivened and enquickened by it. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
how <hi>Mortification</hi> is wrought in theſe <hi>Three ſeverall ſorts</hi> or Conditions of
men by <hi>the Spirit,</hi> is not the ſame. In the <hi>First ſort,</hi> the <hi>Cure</hi> is Commonly
<hi>Begun</hi> by the <hi>Contrary,</hi> but alwaies <hi>Finiſhed</hi> by <hi>Aſſimilation.</hi> God ſometimes
weakens the inclinations of the natural man againſt his wil, without Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
of his own <hi>Spirit. Some men</hi> are prone to offend or to ſurfet of the fleſh
unto death, by the abundance of health, or too Lively plight of Body; and
theſe God in mercie ſometimes viſits with grievous ſickneſſes, for preventing
the diſeaſes which would otherwiſe grow upon them. <q>And many Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
men (as a<note n="*" place="margin">I think he means Plinie Junior in that excellent 26. Epiſtle Lib. 7. See the note in the end of Ch. 36.</note> Heathen confeſſeth) being thus viſited, firſt begin ſeriouſly
to think themſelves but men, ſubject to miſerie and Mortalitie; and that
there is a God or Divine Power which is the Author and Giver of Life.</q>
                     <hi>Others</hi> are prone to incurre danger of death, by abundance of Wealth;
which the more it abounds, the more it commonly increaſeth the diſeaſe: For
<hi>Creſcit amor nummi quantum ipſa pecunia Creſcit;</hi> As money or wealth increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth,
ſo ordinarily the Love of it increaſeth. And theſe God oft times in
mercie viſiteth with loſſe of Goods, or with ſome other Croſſe or Affliction
which either deprives them of opportunities, or deterres from the means of
increaſing wealth. And this is a part of the Cure, or a preparation to it, and
is uſually wrought by <hi>Contraries. Others</hi> are prone to incurre hardneſſe of
heart by Pride and overprizing of themſelves; And theſe God oft times
viſits with Diſgrace, with Contempt or Scorn of Others. Now the <hi>Rule is
General,</hi> That if the Parties thus viſited or cured in Part by <hi>Contraries,</hi> duly
compare their Viſitation with their ſinnes,<note place="margin">☜</note> which in Juſtice have procured
it; <hi>the Spirit</hi> gets great advantage of the Fleſh, and is more capable and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the Motions or Impulſions of Gods <hi>Spirit.</hi> Howbeit man himſelfe and
<hi>the Spirit of man</hi> in this firſt Cure or Part of <hi>Mortification, is meerly Paſſive.</hi> And
it is wel if by often ruminating or Reflecting upon what hath befallen him
by the Providence of God, and by the ſenſe or feeling of the impulſions of
<hi>His Spirit,</hi> he can content himſelf to be <hi>meerely Paſſive,</hi> or a Towardly Patient
in the next Degrees of his <hi>Mortification</hi> or Converſion, which are ſtil wrought
by <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> as by the Agent or efficient Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>4. From theſe Obſervations the Reſolution of the Former Queſtion, ſo
farre as it concerns the <hi>Man unregenerate,</hi> is Eaſie and perſpicuous. The
Queſtion was <hi>[How this Mortification is wrought by the Spirit of God which is
without us, but alwayes aſſiſting us; How by the Spirit of Man,</hi> or by the Spirit
which is in Man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> though partaker of the Spirit of God?] The Anſwer is; <hi>So
much of the Cure as is wrought, is wrought by the Spirit of God, as Preſent to man
but not in Man, as by the only Agent</hi> or Efficient Cauſe; For that is the Effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
which begins and continues the motion: <hi>The ſame Cure is wrought by the
Spirit which is in Man, as by the Immediate and Formal Contrarie:</hi> that is, it is
Formally wrought by <hi>the Spirit</hi> which is in Man, as by <hi>an Agent per Emanatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem,</hi>
as it it moved by <hi>the Spirit of God;</hi> So the Native Cold is expelled out
<pb n="3122" facs="tcp:100044:79"/>
of the water by the Fire as by the only Agent or Efficient: And yet the ſame
Cold is immediatly and Formally expelled by the Heat which the fire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth
in the water, as by a Formal and Incompatible Contrary. The only
End or immediate Effect at which every Natural Agent directly aymes, is
the Aſſimilation of the Subject whereon it works, unto it ſelfe. And this
Aſſimilation is wrought by introducing the like qualitie in the Subject unto
that by which the Agent or Efficient worketh: As the firſt thing which the
Fire ſeeks to Effect, is, to produce Heat in the Water: but the heat once
produced, expels the Cold, as immediately and as formally, as the depreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
or pulling down one ſcale, lifts up the other. The manner how this
<hi>Mortification</hi> is wrought in us by <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> is the very ſame: The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
and direct Effect at which it directly aymeth, is, the <hi>Tranſformation
of our Spirit</hi> into the ſimilitude of the <hi>Spirit of Chriſt:</hi> And this conſiſts in the
Production or Creation of the <hi>Spirit of Grace.</hi> The <hi>Spirit of Grace</hi> being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in us, Or <hi>our Spirit</hi> being touched by <hi>the Spirit of Christ,</hi> as the Steel
is by the Adamant, Formally expels or abateth the Luſt of the Fleſh. And
when the Fleſh is thus truly <hi>mortified</hi> by <hi>the Spirit,</hi> that <hi>Sanctification</hi> of which
the Apoſtle ſpeakes, 1 Theſ. 5. 23. is wrought in us.</p>
                  <p>5. The firſt Part of this Cure (as was ſaid) is wrought by <hi>Contraries:</hi>
that is, by Freeing <hi>the Spirit</hi> of the unregenerate Man from the burden of the
Fleſh which overmaſters it, or inticeth the Soule to ſuch Practiſes as the
<hi>Spirit</hi> diſlikes. And from this Burthen of the Fleſh <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> or his
peculiar Providence, doth free the Soule, or <hi>Spirit of Man,</hi> by laying ſome
one kind or other of Bodily Affliction upon him, which is more diſpleaſing
to his Nature, then the Former Motions of the Fleſh were pleaſant. But
the <hi>Spirit of Man</hi> thus Freed in part from the Burthen of the Fleſh where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
it lay ſmoothered or much oppreſſed, cannot ſo perfect <hi>Mortification</hi>
begun, as Nature freed by Phyſick from oppreſſing humours, digeſts the
Reliques or remainder, and by digeſting them, recovers health and ſtrength.
What Advantage then doth accrue unto <hi>the Spirit of Man</hi> by weakening the
Inclinations of the fleſh? Much every way. For, the Fleſh being thus
weakened, the <hi>Spirit</hi> doth hereby become more <hi>Towardly Paſsive</hi> then it was
before, more apt to be moved by <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> and by ſuch motions
more capable of Spirituall Cure. Every Motion of <hi>our Spirit</hi> by <hi>the Spirit of
God,</hi> doth abate or weaken the Inclinations of the Fleſh: and every ſuch
Abatement or Degree of weakening the Fleſh, is a Degree of <hi>Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Theſe Firſt Degrees of <hi>Mortification</hi> are commonly wrought by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
Fits or Motions of the <hi>Spirit of Man</hi> produced by <hi>the Spirit of God.</hi> The
men that are partakers of them have Libertie or Reſpite in the meane time
to Reflect upon them; and by thus reflecting upon them or by taking them
into ſerious Conſideration, are enabled, to avoid ſuch External Occaſions as
ſtrengthen the Inclinations of the fleſh, and to cut off their Food and Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment.
For albeit the <hi>Spirit of man</hi> be in the firſt Cure <hi>meerely Paſsive:</hi> yet
it is not <hi>ſo Paſſive</hi> as ſtocks and ſtones or other ſenſeleſſe Creatures are: It
hath a true ſenſe or feeling of the Motions put upon it, or produced in it, by
<hi>the Spirit of God.</hi> Nor is the <hi>Spirit of man</hi> ſenſible only of ſuch Motions,
in ſuch ſort as Flyes or Gnats or other imperfect ſenſitive Creatures are of
bodily motion; that is, ſenſible only for the preſent without any remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance
of what is paſt, or conſideration of the like to come. Partly from
the Memory of former Motions, which have been put upon it; Partly
from the Repreſentation or Conſideration of the like apprehended by it, as
<pb n="3123" facs="tcp:100044:79"/>
                     <hi>Poſſibly Future</hi> or approaching, the <hi>Spirit of Man</hi> though it cannot move or
expell the inclinations of the Fleſh by way of <hi>proper Agencie</hi> or Efficiencie, is
yet able ſo to Counterſway them, as that they cannot exerciſe their intended
Motions, or accompliſh their Attempts.</p>
                  <p>7. This is the Apoſtles Doctrine, Gal. 5. 16, 17. <hi>This I ſay then, walke in
the Spirit, and ye ſhall not fulfil the Luſt of the Fleſh.</hi> He doth not ſay; ye ſhall
not be oppoſed or aſſaulted by the luſts of the fleſh: for, (as in the next
words is included,) the fleſh will ſtill attempt the Execution or Exerciſe of
its Motion. For, the <hi>Fleſh</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>Luſteth againſt the Spirit, and
the Spirit againſt the Fleſh, and theſe are contrary the one to the other; So that ye
cannot do things that ye would.</hi> That is, The Fleſh can neither do the things
that it intendeth to do, nor <hi>the Spirit</hi> produce thoſe Effects which it wiſheth
and much deſireth; no more then Heat can produce its proper Effects,
when it is overmatched (in the ſame Subject) with Cold; or, then Cold is
able to produce the proper effects thereof, whileſt it is attempered or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terſwayed
by Heat. Now <hi>the Spirit</hi> whereof our Apoſtle ſpeakes in this
place, is <hi>the Spirit of man,</hi> at leaſt <hi>the Spirit which is in man</hi> though in part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
by <hi>the Spirit of God.</hi> For, as the Apoſtle ſpeakes, the Fleſh and the
Spirit here meant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> are Contrarie: And <hi>it is the nature of Contraries to be in one
and the ſame Subject:</hi> And it is the true propertie of Contrarie Inclinations to
move and ſway upon one and the ſame <hi>Centre</hi> or Point of Reſt or Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
Otherwiſe, how ſtrong ſoever the one Contrary be, it could not
Counterſway nor Counterpoyſe the other. The Point or <hi>Centre</hi> whereupon
the inclinations of the <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> doe move or ſway, is the Soule which ſometimes inclines more unto <hi>the Spirit,</hi> ſometimes more unto <hi>the Fleſh</hi> or
Carnall Affections. The whole worke of <hi>Mortification</hi> is but a Putting off
the Old man and Putting on the New. The more the inclinations of the
Fleſh are weakened, the more apt is the <hi>Spirit of Man</hi> to be moved, impelled,

by <hi>the Spirit of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> the more eaſily and Readily will the inclination
of the Fleſh or Old man be weakened by it. So that there is a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuall
Reciprocation</hi> betwixt the weakening of the Fleſh, and the ſtrengthening
or renewing of the Spirit. In every ſeverall Act or motion of <hi>Gods Spirit,</hi> by
which the <hi>Spirit in man</hi> is renewed or quickened, the <hi>Spirit of man</hi> thus aſſiſted
by the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> gets <hi>a Double Advantage</hi> of the fleſh: <hi>Firſt,</hi> it directly wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
the inclinations of the Fleſh or old man, and by weakening them, gains
further poſſeſſion or intereſt in the Affections, wherein the luſts or deſires of
the fleſh were ſeated. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The <hi>Spirit of man</hi> being revived and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> doth not only Counterſway or curbe the Fleſh, but
withall doth Purifie the Soul, or the Fountain of the Affections, &amp; in the next
Conflicts uſeth the Service of the Soule and inferiour Affections to Conquer
and expell the Remainder of Carnal deſires or Concupiſcence, or at leaſt
doth keep them under that they cannot make head or open rebellion as it
were to depoſe <hi>the Spirit</hi> of its Soveraigntie, after once it hath gotten it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially

the aſſiſtance <hi>of the Spirit of God,</hi> in <hi>waiting</hi> His Approach, <hi>and attending</hi>
His Motions. But let no man think he hath got the victorie over the Fleſh,
or hath performed this Dutie of <hi>Mortification</hi> as he ought, until the Deſires
or Inclinations of the Fleſh be <hi>Mortified</hi> by the vivification or quickening of

                  <head type="sub">Wherein the Accompliſhment of Mortification, or, of
Converſion unto God, doth properly Conſiſt.</head>
                  <p>1. AFter this Preparative to <hi>Mortification</hi> thus begun by <hi>the Spirit of
God</hi> or by his Peculiar Providence, the whole Cure conſiſts in the
Aſſimilation or Transformation of <hi>our Spirit</hi> into the ſimilitude or
Likeneſſe of <hi>the Spirit of God:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Some Reliques of the Image of God in man, which are not in Divells.</note> and this is wrought by <hi>the Renewing of Gods
Image</hi> in us. Some Reliques there be of Gods Image in the natural man,
the like whereof are not in Divells: and theſe are ſeated in <hi>The Spirit</hi> or
<hi>Syntereſis.</hi> Howbeit theſe in themſelves are no better then dead ſtocks or
rootes untill they be revived by <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> and ſecret Influence of his
Graces: but ſo renewed they naturally diffuſe the influence of life into the
ſtemmes or branches. The ſoul and body of the whole man are ſo quicke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
by them, as the branches or ſtemmes in the ſpring time revive by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
of ſap from the root: Both are quickned and revived by <hi>the Spirit of
God,</hi> and by the ſweet diſpoſition of his Providence, as trees, as herbs,
graſſe, and other Vegetables are by the Sun, by the ſweet influence of
Heaven, and by the moyſtned Earth, whereby the rootes are immediatly
cheriſhed.</p>
                  <p>2. This <hi>Vivification</hi> or renewing of <hi>the Spirit in man,</hi> is immediatly
wrought <hi>Per Simile;</hi> As our Animal or Vital Spirits in Swounds are revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the Spirit of wine or other comfortable water. <hi>Firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques
of Gods Image or implanted Rules of Conſcience have more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
Similitude with <hi>the Spirit of God</hi> or of Chriſt, than the inferior Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of the Soul or body have. And yet theſe Reliques of Gods Image or
Rules of Conſcience being true parts or native branches of the <hi>Spirit of man,</hi>
ſymbolize better with the ſoul and body of man, then this <hi>Spirit of God</hi>
which worketh this <hi>Mortification,</hi> doth. So that albeit the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> or
his preventing Grace doth alwayes begin this <hi>Mortification,</hi> without any
operation or Co-Agencie of the <hi>Spirit of man;</hi> And albeit the <hi>Spirit</hi> of man
be a <hi>Meer Paſſive</hi> in all the Motions by which it ſelf is renewed and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en'd:
Yet after it be not only moved, but thus <hi>touched</hi> and quickened by
<hi>the Spirit of God, Actus agit;</hi> it works, not only by Counterſway or Reni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tencie,
but it diffuſeth the influence of Life and Grace which it ſelf receiveth
entirely from the <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> throughout the inferiour Faculties of the
Soul: It takes the place or room of ſo much of the Luſts of the fleſh, as it
Expells; And as well in the Expulſion of the Luſts of the Fleſh, as in taking
poſſeſſion of the Body wherein they were ſeated, it uſeth the Soul as the
<hi>Medium deferens,</hi> as the <hi>Mean</hi> (at leaſt) for communicating life to the Fleſh
or Body. And by this Diffuſion of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Life or influence of Grace
throughout the Faculties or Affections of the Soul, the <hi>ſecond part</hi> or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of <hi>Mortification</hi> is wrought, which (as was ſaid before) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth
in the <hi>Reſcuing</hi> or winning of the natural Affections from the Fleſh
unto the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. For better underſtanding the manner how this Accompliſhment of
<pb n="3125" facs="tcp:100044:80"/>
                     <hi>Mortification</hi> is wrought, We are to conſider, that albeit the <hi>Lusts</hi> of the
Fleſh are <hi>ſimply evill:</hi> yet the <hi>Affections</hi> wherein they are alwayes ſeated,
are in their nature <hi>neither ſimply Good nor ſimply Evill,</hi> but of an Indefinite
or Indifferent Temper between Moral Goodneſſe and that which is Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
Evill. They become Good or Evill, or at leaſtwiſe, more or leſſe
evill, according to the ſeveral marks at which they aym, or the diverſitie
of the Objects on which they beſtow themſelves, or of the Iſſues which they
find. True it is, that the <hi>Fountain of our Affections</hi> is ſo <hi>tainted by Original
corruption,</hi> that no Affections or deſires, as they iſſue from the heart of the
Natural collapſed man, are pure or free from ſtain or ſin: yet they become
more or Leſſe filthy or criminous according to the Courſe or Current which
they take. The Fountain of the Firſt Mans Affections was clear and pure:
yet were his deſires polluted by the Vent or Iſſue which they took; as a
ſtream or Rivulet which takes its Original from a pure Rock, doth inſtantly
loſe its Original Puritie by falling into a muddy Channel, or running
through a filthy ſink, eſpecially if the Current by ſtoppage or other external
cauſe, do Reciprocate upon the Fountain or ſpring. On the Contrarie,
the water which ſpringeth out of a moſſe or quagg, becomes purer and clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
by taking its courſe through a Rock or Gravel. It being granted then
that the verie Fountain of our Affections or deſires is polluted, and unclean;
the <hi>Mortification</hi> whereof we ſpeak, is then truely wrought, when the
natural Affections wherein the Luſts of the fleſh are ſeated, are recovered or
diverted from the <hi>Courſe of the Fleſh,</hi> and won unto the <hi>Conduit of the Spirit.</hi>
The Fleſh or deeds of the Body muſt be <hi>Mortified;</hi> But this <hi>mortification</hi>
muſt be wrought, not by <hi>mortifying</hi> or deſtroying, but firſt by purifying,
then by quickening or reviving the natural Affection, wherewith the Luſts
of the fleſh do mingle, as mire or filth doth with water which falls into it, or
as bad humours do with the blood.</p>
                  <p>4. Laſciviouſneſſe is reckoned by St. Paul amongſt the works of the
fleſh: And Mary Magdalen who had been Notoriouſly Wanton and Laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
had this member of the Old man truely <hi>Mortified</hi> in her without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feebling
or benumming the <hi>Affection of Love</hi> it ſelf, which was as ſtrong in her
as ever it had been, but ſet upon its right mark, and imployed in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
of the Spirit. <hi>She ſtood</hi> (ſaith the Text) <hi>at our Saviours Feet behind him,
weeping, and began to Waſh his Feet with teares, and did wipe them with the
haires of her head, and kiſſed his feet, and annointed them with the oyntment.</hi>
Luk. 7. 38. Thus ſhe did becauſe ſhe Loved much: And ſhe Loved
much, becauſe many ſins were forgiven her. Her Wanton Love or rather
the wantonneſſe of her love was truely <hi>Mortified</hi> by the vivification or
Quickening of Spiritual Love in her: For the Love of the fleſh was <hi>mortified</hi>
by the Love of the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>5.<note place="margin">The accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of <hi>Mortification</hi> conſiſts not in <hi>deading</hi> but in <hi>winning the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> unto the Spirit.</note> Amongſt other Deeds of the Body, amongſt all the Luſts of the Fleſh,
Pride or Ambition is the moſt dangerous, and muſt be <hi>Mortified by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi>
But wherein doth the true <hi>Mortification</hi> of it conſiſt? Not in Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives;
not in an Abſolute diſeſteem of all Honour, or diſclaiming all deſire of
praiſe or reputation. For this may ſtand with <hi>Stoical ſtupiditie,</hi> or <hi>Cynical
ſloth,</hi> or naſty proud contempt of the world: which kind of temper hath
leaſt affinity with that <hi>Mortification</hi> which becomes a Chriſtian: For <hi>This</hi>
requires, that the Affection it ſelf remain entire for the ſervice of <hi>the Spirit.</hi>
Rom. 6. 19. The Affection out of which Pride or Ambition groweth (as a
<hi>Wen</hi> out of a comely Body) is a Deſire of Praiſe or Honour. Neither is <hi>all
Deſire of any Honour,</hi> nor the Exceſſive deſire of ſome Honour a work or

luſt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the Fleſh, or any branch of Pride or Ambition, which properly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
in the <hi>immoderate Deſire of that Honour which is from men.</hi> This indeed
is a Luſt of the Fleſh or Carnal Concupiſcence, which muſt be <hi>Mortified.</hi>
And the beſt Method for the <hi>Mortification</hi> of this Deſire, is by raiſing the
eſteem or price of that <hi>Honour which cometh from God.</hi> This Deſire muſt
have the predominant ſway in our heart, before we can be true Beleevers.
So our Saviour teacheth us Iohn. 5. 44. <hi>How can ye beleeve which receive
honour one of another, and ſeek not the honour that cometh from God, Only?</hi>
Now without true <hi>Belief</hi> there can be no true <hi>Mortification.</hi> The ſame Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
which worketh Faith or <hi>Belief</hi> in us, doth with it and by it, give us the
true eſteem of <hi>that Honour which cometh From God, Alone.</hi> The true eſteem
of <hi>this Honour</hi> being imprinted upon our ſoul and ſpirit, doth increaſe the
Deſire of it. And as the Deſire of it is increaſed, Pride and ambition
(which is but a deſire of that Honour which is from Men or from the
world) muſt needes decreaſe, and by thus decreaſing be truely <hi>Mortified.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Another moſt dangerous work of the Fleſh is Covetouſneſs. The
<hi>mortification</hi> of this work or member of the <hi>old man,</hi> doth not conſiſt in a
Retchleſs Temper, or neglective Content in Living from hand to mouth,
without any provident care for Times Future: for this <hi>is Sottiſhneſs.</hi> The
deſire of riches is not a ſin but a natural Affection, which muſt not be <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,</hi>
that is, not deſtroyed, but revived and quickened. Wherein then
doth Covetouſneſs conſiſt? Not <hi>ſimply in the Deſire of riches,</hi> but in the
<hi>Exceſſive deſire of ſuch riches</hi> as periſh, or of ſuch other meanes or of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
of Life, as are leſs worth then Life it ſelf. The Affection or Deſire of
riches is not to be quelled, but to be diverted from its muddie Channel, by
the Spirit of <hi>Mortification.</hi> This ſpirit of Life doth draw or conduct our
deſires that way which the Lord of Life commands them to take; that is,
to ſeek after Riches, but after <hi>Riches of another kinde: Lay not up for your
ſelves treaſure upon Earth, where moth and ruſt doth corrupt, and where theeves
break through and ſteal. But Lay up for your ſelves treaſure in heaven, where nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
moth nor ruſt doth corrupt, and where theeves do not break through and
ſteal.</hi> Mat. 6. 19. 20. By the Parable Likewiſe of the <hi>unjuſt Steward,</hi>
and that other of the <hi>Talents,</hi> we are commanded to imitate, or rather to
out-ſtrip the Uſurer or cunning Bargainer for worldly Commodities, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent
care and watchfull obſervance for increaſing this Heavenly Treaſure;
in being as wiſe and careful in doing good to others, as Worldlings are in
doing good unto themſelves. No man offends in being vigilant and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but in imploying his witts and care for gaining Tranſitory Wealth,
which is leſs worth then his Life or ſoul; whereas this bodily Life it ſelf is
well Loſt or Laid to pawn, for gaining Treaſure in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>7. Drunkenneſs is a work of the Fleſh which muſt be <hi>mortified.</hi> The Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
whence this Loathſome ſtream doth ſpring, is a deſire of mirth or
pleaſure. For no man directly deſires to be <hi>Drunk.</hi> All men naturally
deſire to be <hi>Merrie,</hi> as having an internal ſpring of delight or mirth in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
which naturally deſires an iſſue or vent; otherwiſe, the Soul and
Spirit becomes <hi>ſodden in Melancholy.</hi> Hence it is, that many mens Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
deteſting this <hi>Melancholy</hi> humour, be drenched in this Filthy ſink
or puddle of <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> which <hi>is but a Siniſter or prepoſterous Iſſue of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred
Mirth.</hi> The true <hi>Mortification</hi> of this <hi>monſter</hi> is not to be ſought by
quelling or weakening the Affection whence it ſprings, but rather by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
it another Iſſue or vent. Thus much is implyed in our Apoſtles ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.
Eph. 5. 18. <hi>Be not Drunk with wine wherein is Exceſs, but be filled
<pb n="3127" facs="tcp:100044:81"/>
with the ſpirit, ſpeaking to your ſelves in Pſalmes and Hymns and ſpiritual ſongs,
ſinging and making Melody in your heart to the Lord.</hi> Our Apoſtle here ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth,
that <hi>the ſpirit of God,</hi> which alone worketh the <hi>mortification</hi> of this
ſin and other Luſts of the fleſh, although he deteſts all drunken ryotous
mirth, is not a dull ſpirit of <hi>melancholy.</hi> It delighteth much in its own mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick,
alwaies deſirous to hear pleaſant ſongs of its own ſetting. And there
is no meanes ſo Effectual for drowning drunken mirth, as a full conſort of
the muſick of this ſpirit; <hi>Beatus populus, quiſcit Jubilationem hanc.</hi> Bleſſed
are the People That can rejoyce in Thee O Lord.</p>
                  <p>8.<note place="margin">The perfect Cure of the Soul is wrought <hi>Per Simile.</hi>
                     </note> Thus it is plain how this Cure muſt be wrought by Contraries, and
yet <hi>per ſimile,</hi> by the <hi>Like</hi> too. The Luſts of the Fleſh muſt be <hi>Mortified
by the Spirit,</hi> and yet theſe are Contraries. But if we deſcend unto Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:
Ambition or deſire of honour, muſt be <hi>mortified</hi> by deſire of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.
Covetouſneſs which is a deſire of Riches, muſt be <hi>mortified</hi> by the
deſire of Riches. Drunkenneſs which is a Deſire of Mirth, muſt be <hi>morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
by a deſire of Mirth. Immoderate carnal Love muſt be <hi>mortified</hi> by
exceſſive Love of Chriſt and of things Spiritual. Between the Deſires them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
there is as true <hi>Similitude</hi> as is between the ſeveral currents of water
which iſſue from the ſame ſpring or fountain; but as perfect a <hi>Contrarietie</hi>
between the Objects and iſſues of the deſires, as there is between the ſeveral
waters of the ſame fountain, whileſt the <hi>One</hi> runnes in a pure rock or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit
pipe, and <hi>the other</hi> into a ſink or puddle.</p>
                  <p>9. To Conclude then; <hi>The ſpirit of God</hi> doth firſt purifie the Fountain
of our Deſires, that is, <hi>the ſpirit or Conſcience of man.</hi> The <hi>ſpirit of man</hi>
being thus quickened and purified, doth by direction and aſſiſtance of the
ſame <hi>Spirit of God,</hi> divert the current of his Deſires, and give a new vent or
iſſue to his Affections. And the Deſires or Affections by this diverſion of
their Current, receive a further Degree of Purification from the Ocean or Sea
into which they empty themſelves, that is, from Heaven and the heavenly
Lights on which they are ſett. Between the Current of our Deſires or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
thus purified by <hi>the ſpirit of God,</hi> and the Coeleſtial Objects whereon
they are ſett, there is ſuch Reciprocation or mutual recourſe, as it were
between <hi>a ſtream of pure water</hi> and a <hi>Sea of Nectar;</hi> the ſtream or ſpring ſtill
falling into the ſea, and the ſea ſtill ſweetning the ſtream by reflowing upon
it. The <hi>ſpirit</hi> of Chriſt which knowes no bounds or Limits; which is more
boundleſs then the Ocean, delights in our Deſires or Affections whileſt they
are ſett upon heavenly things. And the more his <hi>ſpirit</hi> is delighted in our
Deſires and Affections thus emptying and pouring out themſelves, the more
he purifies and ſweetens them by the influence of his Gratious <hi>Spirit.</hi> Yet
are not any mans Affections ſo throughly ſweetned by the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Grace in
this Life, as not to retain ſome permanent Tincture or mixture of the Fleſh.
Howbeit, every man is Throughly <hi>mortified,</hi> in whom the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of Chriſt
hath gotten the Soveraigntie over the Fleſh, and won the better part of the
natural Affections, to its ſervice. But whether this Soveraigntie being
Once gotten, may not <hi>Finally</hi> or for a time at leaſt be loſt, Heave it to the
determination of the Schooles. My application for the preſent ſhall be

was, to make them an <hi>Introduction</hi> unto the <hi>Second part of the
Knowledge of Chriſt</hi> and of him <hi>Crucified,</hi> and of his <hi>Reſurrection</hi>
from the dead, and <hi>Sitting</hi> at the right hand of the Father: that is in a word,
How he doth ſet us <hi>Free Indeed</hi> from the <hi>Servitude</hi> of ſin and Satan. The
<hi>Second End</hi> and moſt immediatly ſubordinate to this purpoſe was, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke

a great part of the Chriſtian World; ſpecially ſince thoſe <hi>Vnfortunate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies</hi>

Controverſie has been under debate nothing has been done, even in Duties

know, what he is willing or would be pleaſed to do, and what we may and

by the ſon of God.</p>
                  <p>2. The <hi>Points</hi> uſeful for clearing this buſineſs are but <hi>Two.</hi> And both of
them have been handled before. The <hi>Summe</hi> of the <hi>Former</hi> in Brief was this.
[What <hi>Freedome of will</hi> may be conceived Compatible with abſolute <hi>Servi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi>
to ſin and Satan?] <hi>The Anſwer</hi> in Brief * was This:<note place="margin">See chapt. 24.</note> That without
ſome Portion of <hi>Free-Will,</hi> even in the natural and unregenerate man, all
the <hi>Admonitions</hi> Given by our Saviour in the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of St. Johns Goſpel unto
the Jewes, or afterwards by his Apoſtles to both Jewes and Gentiles, had
been much better beſtowed on Bruit Beaſts whether wilde or tame, nay
even upon ſtocks and ſtones, then upon men. For the true reaſon, why
Bruit Beaſts or other Creatures cannot be Servants, is, becauſe they are not
endowed with <hi>Reaſon,</hi> or (which is all one) with ſome <hi>Free-Will.</hi> Everie
<pb n="3130" facs="tcp:100044:83"/>
Civil Servant or Slave hath as <hi>Free a Will</hi> as his Maſter hath; Sometimes a
great<note n="*" place="margin">See the notes at the end of this Chapt.</note> deal more Free. The Eſſential Difference betwixt them is this;
That a Servant hath no <hi>Liberum Arbitrium,</hi> no power or Arbitrement to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of his own Actions or imployments according to his own <hi>Free-Will</hi> or
choyce, but according to the <hi>Free-Will</hi> or appointment of his Maſter. Brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and more <hi>Punctually</hi> thus: It were impoſſible there ſhould be any ſuch
<hi>Servum Arbitrium</hi> or true <hi>Servitude</hi> unto ſin, as <hi>Luther</hi> contended for, where
there is not <hi>Libera Voluntas,</hi> ſuch <hi>Freedome of Will</hi> as we now treat of. And
this was all that <hi>Eraſmus</hi> did conclude, or (I take it) did intend to make
good againſt him. It was an overſight in <hi>Luther</hi> and in moſt of his Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
(Learned <hi>Chemnitius</hi> only excepted) not to diſtinguiſh <hi>inter Liberum Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrium
&amp; Liberam Voluntatem. Vid. Chem. Comm. in Melan. de Libero Arbit.
Sive (ut Chemnitius agnoſcit Luculentiorem eſſe Titulum) de Viribus Humanis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. The <hi>Second uſefull Point</hi> is, to know, [What Branch of <hi>Free-Will</hi>
either the Natural man before he come to profeſs Chriſtianity; or Chriſtian
Children Baptized, are bound in the firſt place to exerciſe?] To this <hi>The
Anſwer</hi> is eaſie, and hath alreadie been given before;<note n="*" place="margin">Chapt. 25. &amp; ch. 29.</note> That every Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
Child or other Capable of being Catechized, are in the firſt place bound
to exerciſe that part of <hi>Free will</hi> whereby mankind is radically and prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
diſtinguiſhed from bruit beaſts, that is, the <hi>Freedom</hi> or power <hi>of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting</hi>
upon their own thoughts or Actions, or upon Others advice or
Counſel for caſting off the yoke of <hi>Servitude</hi> to ſin. Now the greater Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potencie
or want of Power any man finds in himſelf to ſett himſelf <hi>Free,</hi> or
to do well, the greater Opportunitie and better Motives he hath to beſeech
God and the Son of God our Saviour Chriſt, to ſett him <hi>Free,</hi> and to enable
him to do thoſe things which being done he ſhall be ſet <hi>Free.</hi> For the
Queſtion is not, nor ever ought to have been made, [Whether we have
any <hi>Free-Will</hi> or power to make our ſelves <hi>Free,</hi> but; Whether we have a <hi>Free-Will</hi>
or ſome Abilitie to do thoſe things, which being done, we ſhall be made
<hi>Free,</hi> which being left undone, we have no Hope or probable Aſſurance that
we ſhall be made <hi>Free Indeed</hi> by the Son of God.]</p>
                  <p>4. Let Every one that is called a Chriſtian and is not aſhamed of the
Croſs of Chriſt or of Baptiſm in his name, account it an open ſhame or
<hi>Scandal</hi> both to his <hi>Perſon</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> either to deny or ſuſpect that he
hath not the ſame meaſure of <hi>Free-Will,</hi> (or a greater,) which Naaman
the Syrian had, when he came to the Prophet. Now he had a true <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
of Will</hi> or choyce of harkening or not harkening to Good Counſel.
The one Branch he exerciſed in not obeying the Prophets Command: The
other he practiſed in hearkening to his Servants Advice or Counſel. And it
went better with him that he did ſo: For otherwiſe he might have gone home
a more grievous Leper then he came, and made himſelf uncapable of the
Miracle wrought upon him by God alone. Let us Likewiſe account it a
ſhame to ſuſpect, that we have not the ſame <hi>Freedome of Will;</hi> which the
Widdow of <hi>Sarepta</hi> had. Now ſhe had a true <hi>Freedome of Will</hi> or choyce,
either to relieve or not to relieve the Prophet out of her ſmall ſtore. If
ſhe had not relieved him, ſhe and her Child might have died for hunger
within few daies after. But ſhe making choyce of the better part of ſuch
<hi>Freedome of Will</hi> as ſhe had, was with her Child preſerved alive by miracle.
Let ſuch as be <hi>Servants</hi> to ſin, as ſhe was then, when the Prophet came to
her, uſe that Portion of <hi>Free-Will</hi> which they have, either as well or not
further amiſs, then ſhe did hers: And the Lord (no doubt) will work as
great miracles in and upon their Soules, as he did upon her poor pittance of
<pb n="3131" facs="tcp:100044:83"/>
oyl and meal. Let not any man that profeſſeth himſelf the <hi>Servant</hi> of Chriſt,
be more prone to <hi>Tempt God by Diſtruſting,</hi> then to <hi>Try his Goodneſſe by
practiſing</hi> the Like works of mercy and charitie, as that poor Widdow
did.</p>
                  <p>5. Even ſuch amongſt us are moſt converſant and buſieſt in the med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
or market-way to Gain or Preferment, and by their ſeveral Trades or
<hi>Callings</hi> which they have made choyce of, more obnoxious then other men
are, to the temptations of the Prince of this world, will ſcorn to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
not to have as much <hi>Free-Will,</hi> or Good Nature, or as good affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
towards Chriſt and his Goſpel, as the Romane Souldiers or Publicans
had unto John Baptiſts Perſon, or his Doctrine of Repentance. And a
<hi>Freedome of Will</hi> or ability they certainly have, as well to be contented with
their wages or Fees, and to deal Conſcionably, as to exact more then their
due, or to oppreſs others by bribery, by extortion, or unjuſt exactions.
If they make choyce of practiſing this later Branch of ſuch <hi>Free-Will</hi> as they
have: this is but to take <hi>Earneſt</hi> mony to become hired <hi>Servants unto Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon.</hi>
If they make choyce of that part of <hi>Free-Will</hi> which <hi>Zachaeus</hi> did
practiſe, that is, to be Charitable, Liberal to the poor, and to make ſuch
<hi>Reſtitution</hi> as he did, to thoſe whom they have wronged: then they ſhall
be made Children of Abraham, or (which is more) true <hi>Servants</hi> of God,
and of Chriſt, <hi>whoſe Service is perfect Freedome.</hi>

                     </note> Again, albeit not many of us (ſcarce Ten in any Age ſince the Apoſtles
Times) have any <hi>Freedome of Will</hi> or ability to determine or examine the
Controverſies about the power of <hi>Grace</hi> and of <hi>Nature;</hi> about <hi>Juſtification</hi>
or <hi>Election:</hi> yet even the meaneſt amongſt us have a <hi>Freedome of Will,</hi> either
to ſay or not to ſay their dayly Prayers or Devotions; and a Like <hi>Freedome
of Will,</hi> to frequent or not to frequent the Solemn Prayers of the Church,

to underſtand the meaning of them, being expounded unto them by their
ordinary Paſtors or <hi>Catechists,</hi> whom I could wiſh to make this, one ſpecial
work of their Function.</p>
                  <p>7. For Concluſion, I ſhall commend to every Readers or Teachers
Meditations, that Prayer of the Church appointed to be read (amongſt
others) in the ſecond Service. <hi>[Prevent us, O Lord in all our doings with thy
moſt Gratious Favour, and further us with thy Continual Help, that in all our
works begun, continued, and ended in thee, we may glorifie Thy Holy Name, and
finally by thy mercy obtain everlaſting Life, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.]</hi> In
the Firſt part of this <hi>Godly Prayer</hi> we have the State of the Queſtion concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
the <hi>Concurrence of Grace and Free-Will,</hi> more pithily and more plainly
ſet down, than in any Controverſie-writers, whether in the Romiſh or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
Churches. The Summe is, that without Gods <hi>Preventing Grace,</hi> or
peculiar diſpoſition of his Favourable Providence, we cannot do <hi>any Good
Works</hi> at all, though but Civilly or <hi>Morally Good,</hi> (as a Learned Jeſuit ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgeth)
nor any works <hi>Spiritually Good</hi> without Gods aſſiſtant <hi>Grace</hi>
or Gifts of the Spirit inherent in us. This is that which is in the ſame Prayer
Better expreſſed by <hi>The Furtherance of his continual help.</hi> In the later Clauſe
of the ſame Prayer <hi>[That in all our works begun, continued and ended in thee,
we may glorifie thy holy name, and finally by thy mercy obtain everlaſting Life,]</hi>
we have all (I am perſwaded) that the Romiſh Church would have ſaid
Concerning the <hi>Neceſſitie of Good Works,</hi> Whether unto Salvation or Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
and all again that the Proteſtants have ſaid or can ſay, againſt the
Romiſh Church, concerning <hi>Juſtification by Faith only,</hi> without works.
<pb n="3132" facs="tcp:100044:84"/>
When we Pray, <hi>that we may glorifie Gods Name by our good works;</hi> this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues
their <hi>Neceſſity</hi> unto Salvation, if not to Juſtification. And when we
pray, that after we have glorified Gods Name by our Good works, <hi>we may
attain Everlaſting life, by Gods mercy in Chriſt, and through Chriſt:</hi> this is an
Argument moſt Concludent, that we muſt not rely upon, or put our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence
in the Beſt Works which we do, though we do them continually;
but in Gods <hi>Mercies,</hi> and Chriſts <hi>Merits Only.</hi> And this is the Full and
Lively Expreſſion of our Apoſtles meaning, when he ſaith: <hi>We are Juſtified
by Faith in Chriſt alone.</hi> Finally, Let all of us remember this <hi>Leſſon,</hi> that
when it is ſaid, <hi>We are to Renounce Good works in the Plea of Faith,</hi> or all Truſt<note place="margin">☜</note>
or Confidence in our Selves, or in our Merits or Workes: This muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes
be underſtood, of the <hi>Good works which we have done,</hi> not of the
<hi>Good works which we have left undone,</hi> much leſs of Works which we have
done amiſs. We muſt (as our Saviour inſtructs us, Luk: 14. ver. 26.
and many other places) deny our ſelves and forſake all, before we can be
truely his Diſciples. And we muſt be truly his Diſciples, before we can be
made <hi>Free by Him Indeed,</hi> as is apparent from the words of our Saviour here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore
recited. Ioh. 8. 36. Let us therefore beſeech him which quencheth not
ſmoaking Flax and cruſheth not a bruiſed Reed, to plant in us <hi>Good Intentions</hi>
to grow by his Aſſiſting <hi>Grace</hi> into <hi>Good Deſires;</hi> and good deſires, into firm
and conſtant <hi>Reſolutions</hi> of doing that which is good and acceptable in his
ſight; and finally to Crown our beſt Endeavours wrought in us by his
<hi>Grace</hi> with Everlaſting Life and <hi>Glory</hi> through <hi>His Mercy in Jeſus Chriſt our
Lord.</hi> Amen, Amen.</p>

They were ſick of divers Privative Defects. The Spring was foul, (not waſht with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

but ſucks from the Brests and ſweetneſſe of their native ſoil. Some of their Vertues were
Hybridae, Spurious Mungrels, begot by Vices. S. Auſtin ſays, Covetize made ſome prudent,
temperate, valiant, industrious, Per mare pauperiem—, yea in ſome things just. Some but
Apes of True Vertue, like the Circumciſion us'd by Nations not in Covenant. Some were
monstrous, made up of Contradictions to their own Rules. Diogenes was content with a litle;

went another. 2. Moſtly they fell ſhort of the End: the great univerſall right End; Gods
Glory. Thoſe few that aim'd at any mark above the Moon, did but feel after the moſt Conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous
Being, whoſe Inviſibilities are manifest.</p>
               <p>As, many of their Eys were Dimme, ſo few were ſingle, or of right Intention. Yet by the Bye,
ſome thought of Schooling the Eye, or making a Covenant with it. Pericles rebuk't Sophocles

did Things of the Law not Legally; Good not well: <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>. Alas! they were

The Conſequence is plain, Their Rona were not Beatifica. Their labours do not follow them
ſo that theſe men ſhall be bleſſed in their doings. I know 'tis ſaid uſually, They were but Splendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da

               <p>Now for a Cloſe to this long Note; I will but name 2. or 3. of our Chriſtian Worthies which
will not Commend us of this preſent Age; but will ſhine all theſe Twinkling Starres of Ethnick
Glories, into night: and ſhame, and ſhrink them into nothing. For number they be none, in

Againſt the three Youths inſtanc't pag. 3135. I put in the Scale; 1. Epagathus that young

tormented. I could caſt in Attalus with his Iron Chair; Maturus, and Sanctus (men
of their own Names) tortured and beheaded. And women too, Potamiaena, Blandina, Biblis,
and St. Baſils 40. Martyrs in a ſevere froſt put into a pond, and then burnt. Holy Barlaam
outvies the Torchbearer in Kind. Val. Max. l. 3. c. 3. ſays he held a Cenſer and that a Cole
burnt his fleſh till it ſmelt. St. Baſil, in his Homilie of him, ſays that St. Barlaam let the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe

ſeem to do it to the Idol. Againſt Polemo's, ſet St. Auſtins Converſion: and the 3000. at one

               <p>The 2. Note relating to Pag. 3115. [Some Actions are required in us, that Grace may be
Created in us.] I might ſave my ſelf the labour of ſaying any thing to this Point, by referring my
Reader to this Authors Soul-ſearching Treatiſe of Juſtifying Faith. 3. Section. p. in quarto
278. where he ſhews, that, This belief of ours [That Faith is the Sole gift of God, wholly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed,
not in part acquired by us:] ſhould rather quicken then quell Chriſtian Endeavours for
attaining it. As this Beliefe, that God alone infuſes the Soule into the Embryo, incourages
them that intend to be Parents (according to the Tenor of Pſ. 128. Appointed by our Church to
be uſed at Marriages) to enter the Holy eſtate and aſcend the undefiled Bed. And the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
ſuits well, thus. As God who can raiſe Children from the Rock, does not infuſe the
the Rational Soul into Stones and Statues, but into Organiz'd Bodies; ſo doth he not ordinarily
beſtow Grace on every Reaſonable Soul, but on ſuch only as have a paſſive Idonietie thereto.
And as thoſe Parents, upon whoſe Offſpring depends the Nurſing of Gods people, are tyed to be
more Cautious then others; Even ſo they that attribute the moſt to that Fundamental Grace of
Faith (none can give enough to it; The Solifidian that gives it moſt in words; in deeds takes
moſt from it) are moſt obliged to teach men to uſe all poſſible meanes, to ſeek the beſt Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of believing, planters, waterers, helpers of Faith; above all, to ſue to God to give the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe:
to Chear men up to work out their Salvation with fear and trembling,<note place="margin">Philip. 2. 13.</note> becauſe it is God
that works both will and deed.</p>
               <p>Yet ſhall I adde de proprio, A word, to thoſe that have ſcarce the patience to hear of any thing
prerequired in man unconverted, that Grace may be Created in him. My Argument with ſuch
an Adverſarie, is this. Let us take a Polemo, that is, pro tempore, à Ganeo; non tantum il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecebris,
ſed ipſa infamia Gaudens. Vpon this man, we deſire the work of the Lord by our
Miniſtery may be proſperous. We muſt either tell him that there is <hi>ſomething</hi> required of him
in this preſent State, unconverted as he is, and ſo ſet him a Taske; or that <hi>nothing</hi> at all is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from him. Theſe two be Points Contradictorie Diametrally, there is no Mean betwixt
them. I ſay, that of this man Something is required. The firſt, minimum quod ſic, is Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting
upon his own actions,<note place="margin">Or, I would read to him the 18. of Ezekiel.</note> and the Law writ in his Conſcience. Next I would Apply ſome
of Gods words ſpoke by the Prophets to ſome ſinfull people or perſon; as Iſa. 1. 16. Waſh you,
<pb n="3144" facs="tcp:100044:90"/>
make you clean, put away the Evill of your doings—, Ceaſe to do Evil, learn to do Good—.
or that of S. James 4. 8. Draw nigh to God—. Cleanſe your hands ye ſinners, and puriſie
your hearts ye double minded. And would affirm, that theſe words ſignify'd ſomething, were
(not Empty noiſes, but) Precepts; and if Praecepts, have ſome Duty correſpondent To be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd
by h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>m to whom I layd them; which is, quod quaerimus; that I would have done.
My Adverſarie muſt ſay, <hi>nothing</hi> is to be done; It's to no purpoſe for me to exhort, or him to
Try, nothing can be done to purpoſe. Now what will the poor Patient ſay? men are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
inclined to believe them that most eaſe and pleaſe their natures best. The least Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
of this Doctrine that he will or can make, and that if he were a Good natur'd man too,
will be This; why then I will betake my ſelf to a Negative Idleneſs, wrap my body in my arms,
ſit ſtill, and wait the Good howr when Grace ſhall breath uppon me. A 2. will ſay, Go to them,
I will eat my meat with joy, and take my portion of the things of this life, till Taſts of a Better
drop into my mouth from heaven. A 3. may perhaps doe worſe; Wend to a tavern or worſe
place, and make work for Grace, with a Graceleſſe Deſperate hope, that the more he ſins, the
more Grace may, when it Comes, abound; that quò ſcelerator eò gratiae vicinior. If my Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary
ſays nay; he must abstain from Lewd Courſes; we are half agreed: is not that part,
the ſame with Eſay's, Ceaſe to do evill? If he maintain his Concluſion; I have no more to ſay,
but to enter an Appeal to God, &amp; this protestation to Man, according to Senſe of this Author;
That I diſclaim all ſuch diſpoſitions, preparations, Endeavours, as, Cooperating to the production
of Grace after the manner that Temperate behaviour concurreth to produce the Habit of Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance;
or that natural qualities do, to produce Forms meerly Phyſical. And this will quit
me from Pelagianiſm or Poperie; But he ſhall never be able to free himſelf from the Errors of
the Stoick or Manichees that holds it indifferent, what works a man does before he be rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate.</p>

                  <p>1. BOth <hi>Propoſitions</hi> are (as we ſay) <hi>Hypothetical</hi> or Conditional, and if
either ſhould be denyed or queſtioned, the only Courſe which the
<hi>Schools</hi> (which are the <hi>high Courts of Reaſon</hi> for Judging of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments)
afford, would be to plead theſe <hi>Categorical</hi> or abſolute <hi>Propoſitions.
[Whoſoever lives after the fleſh ſhall die] [Whoſoever mortifies the Deeds of the
body through the Spirit ſhall live.]</hi> And our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> himſelf, ver. 6. had premi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
Two abſolute <hi>Categoricall Propoſitions,</hi> to inferre or prove theſe two <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
Propoſitions</hi> in the Text. For ſo he ſaith <hi>[To be Carnally minded is
death]</hi> but <hi>[to be ſpiritually minded is life and peace.]</hi> Now albeit he hath
added no <hi>Quantitie</hi> to theſe Two <hi>Categorical Propoſitions;</hi> yet in that he ſaith;
<hi>To be carnally minded is death, and To be ſpiritually minded is life;</hi> This <hi>Infers,</hi> That
Death is the <hi>Neceſſary Conſequent</hi> of Carnal Living; and Life likewiſe the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible
Conſequent</hi> of being ſpiritually minded.<note place="margin">All muſt mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie: though not totally.</note> And it is an <hi>Infallible Rule of

is Equivalent to an Univerſal, although it be delivered in Terms In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definite,
or without addition of any Quantity.] So that when our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
ſaith; <hi>To be carnally minded is death; To be ſpiritually minded is life;</hi> his
Speech is altogether as ful, and more Emphatical, then if he had ſaid: <hi>Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
lives after the fleſh ſhall die. Whoſoever through the Spirit mortifies the deeds
of the body ſhall live.</hi> Howbeit, Theſe Two <hi>Propoſitions</hi> in the Text, thus Redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced

yet no man is tyed under pain of damnation to an abſolute or <hi>Total Mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

be the <hi>Sting of death,</hi> and Carnal Intentions be the Arrows or darts of Sathan;
yet is not every Carnal thought, or every degree of minding the fleſh, ſo
deadly in the iſſue unto the Soul, as the <hi>Parthian Arrows</hi> were to mens Bodies;

in at the leaſt breach, whereat Bloud could come out. But every moment
of life led after the fleſh doth not thus <hi>Neceſſarily</hi> bring forth the death here

<pb n="3147" facs="tcp:100044:91"/>
                     <hi>Mortification</hi> that will ſuffice to bring forth the Life here meant.] For he
doth not ſay, if ye <hi>have Mortified</hi> the deeds of the body, but if ye <hi>do mortifie</hi>
the deeds of the Body ye ſhall live. Theſe <hi>Two Negatives</hi> are as the <hi>Two Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks,</hi>
betwixt which the <hi>Limitation</hi> of the former <hi>Propoſition,</hi> in reſpect of the
<hi>Matter</hi> propoſed, or Duty enjoyned, is wholly Situate. It is a <hi>Poſitive Mean</hi>
between them; ſomewhat <hi>Leſſe</hi> then any Abſolute or <hi>Total Mortification;</hi>
Somewhat <hi>More</hi> then every Degree or Practiſe of <hi>Mortification:</hi> yet all this is
but <hi>Indefinite.</hi> This <hi>Poſitive Mean</hi> betwixt the former <hi>Negatives</hi> muſt of
neceſſitie be either ſome kind of <hi>Mortification</hi> for <hi>Quality</hi> more Precious then
the <hi>Mortification</hi> which moſt men ordinarily affect or practiſe: or ſome Grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Meaſure</hi> of the ſame <hi>Mortification,</hi> whereof moſt men are partakers at
ſome times.</p>
                  <p>3. As Great mens quick Goods are preſumed to be of a better kind or
breed, then the like goods of their poor neighbours (for <hi>Noble-mens Geeſe,</hi> as
the Proverb is, <hi>are Swans)</hi> So there be ſome, who will have all <hi>Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi>
whether of Life or Practiſe, all <hi>Acts</hi> of Duty or Performances to be of a
better kind or rank in the <hi>Elect,</hi> then they are in <hi>Others.</hi> And in theſe mens
<hi>Dialect</hi> or Divinity, the Anſwer to the propoſed <hi>Querie</hi> were eaſy, and would
be <hi>This.</hi> They which <hi>Mortifie</hi> the deeds of the body in ſuch ſort as the <hi>Elect</hi>
do, they certainly ſhall Live, for the <hi>Elect</hi> do <hi>truly mortifie</hi> them, albeit not <hi>in ſo
full a Meaſure.</hi> And as <hi>Belief,</hi> ſo <hi>Mortification,</hi> in <hi>Them</hi> eſpecially, how Little
ſoever it be,<note place="margin">Points of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, &amp;c. are not to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, but to be determined by more general points.</note> ſo it be <hi>True,</hi> will ſuffice unto ſalvation. But in the Divinity
which I have learned, the points of <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation</hi> are to be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
of (if at all they may be determined of) by the Reſolution of other
more General and more facile <hi>Queries.</hi> They are prepoſterouſly brought

of the <hi>Generals</hi> muſt be <hi>Introductions</hi> to the Reſolution or clearing of more
<hi>Special</hi> Difficulties. <hi>Special</hi> Difficulties can be no Introduction to the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of <hi>General</hi> Queries. Now this duty of <hi>Mortification</hi> and the Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of it, to wit, <hi>Living after the fleſh,</hi> are far more <hi>General,</hi> then the eſtate of
<hi>Election</hi> or <hi>Reprobation.</hi> Seeing, as I am often forced to repeat, it is but a litle
Point of mankind, a ſmall Portion of men (which are partakers of the Word
or Sacraments) which are <hi>for the Preſent</hi> contained under either part of <hi>This
Diviſion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">All are not E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, or Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. But all live after the fleſh, or after the Spîrit.</note> either in the State of <hi>Election</hi> or <hi>Reprobation.</hi> But under this Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of <hi>Living after the fleſh</hi> or <hi>after the ſpirit,</hi> all are comprehended. Again, in as
much as we our ſelves are all imployed in this Work of <hi>Mortification,</hi> we may
have more certain Experiments of our Progreſs in this Duty, then we can
have of our eſtate of <hi>Election,</hi> which is meerly the work of God; we have
no finger, no imployment in <hi>it.</hi> The truth is, <hi>Only they</hi> who have <hi>mortified</hi>
the deeds of the Body in <hi>ſuch a meaſure,</hi> as our Apoſtle here requires, are in
the State of <hi>Election. Only they</hi> who have made up <hi>ſuch a meaſure</hi> of ſin or <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
after the Fleſh,</hi> as induceth the Sentence of death here mentioned, are in
the abſolute State of <hi>Reprobation.</hi> So that the <hi>Poſitive Mean</hi> between the two
former <hi>Negatives</hi> muſt be taken from the <hi>meaſure,</hi> not from the <hi>Specifical Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi>
or nature of <hi>mortification.</hi> The very Phraſe or Character of our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
[If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall die; but, if through the Spirit ye mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie
the deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live,] <hi>Neceſſarily includes a Perſeverance</hi>
in either kind. A <hi>Perſeverance</hi> there muſt be in this Duty of <hi>Mortification,</hi>
before we can have full and perfect Intereſt in this Promiſe. Without <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi>
or Continuance in this <hi>life of the Fleſh,</hi> none are inevitably ſentenced
unto the death here denounced againſt all that live <hi>after the Fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. But even <hi>Perſeverance</hi> it ſelf is a <hi>Term Indefinite</hi> and illimited; it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits,
<pb n="3148" facs="tcp:100044:92"/>
though not altogether ſo many determinate degrees or portions, as <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification</hi> doth, (for there muſt be ſome ſet degrees of <hi>Mortification,</hi> before there
can be any <hi>Perſeverance</hi> in <hi>Mortification)</hi> yet a great many Degrees or parts.
And all the degrees of <hi>Perſeverance</hi> are meaſurable by Continuance of Time.
Some there be who require a <hi>Perſeverance</hi> in <hi>Mortification</hi> unto the hour of
death, before a man can be Infallible Heir of the bleſſing here promiſed. They

is, or may be beſtowed upon <hi>us</hi> in <hi>Particular.</hi> Or, if any man in

or kind of Certainty he can be aſſured, that he ſhall <hi>finally Perſevere</hi> in this
Duty of <hi>Mortification,</hi> or that he ſhall ſo <hi>Perſevere</hi> in it, as he ſhall not <hi>finally
fall from Grace.</hi> To begin with the <hi>Firſt Branch</hi> of this Inquiry, to wit; Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the <hi>Gift of perſeverance,</hi> or Certain Eſtate in Grace, may be infallible or
Immutable in this life. Our <hi>Firſt Propoſition</hi> ſhall be this. [There is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
or meaſure of <hi>Mortification</hi> (beſt known unto God) which may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
before the hour of death, by ſome later, by others ſooner, unto which
whoſoever doth attain, he is not only actually inſtated in this Promiſe of life,
but <hi>confirmed in Grace,</hi> and endued with the Gift of <hi>Perſeverance.]</hi> The <hi>Meaſure</hi>
is not the ſame to all; Some may be <hi>Confirmed in Grace,</hi> before they attain
unto the ſame height of <hi>Mortification,</hi> which others muſt Exceed. <hi>To whom
much is given, of them much ſhall be required.</hi> The ſecond Propoſition is This,
[There is a Degree or Meaſure of <hi>living after the Fleſh</hi> (beſt known unto God)
which may be made up in this Life, by ſome ſooner, by others later, which
meaſure whoſoever doth make up or go beyond it, doth hereby become ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the Sentence of death hereby denounced, and falls into the ſtate of
<hi>Reprobation.</hi> The truth of both <hi>Propoſitions</hi> may be inferred from the <hi>Analogie</hi>
of Faith or points of Doctrine heretofore delivered concerning the Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or continuance of Publick-Weal or Proſperity,<note place="margin">See his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons upon 2 Chr. 6. 39. And upon Jer. 26. 19. preach't before the King.</note> and the Certainty or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility
of Ruine and Deſtruction to States and Kingdomes. <hi>Sauls</hi> King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
was upon the point of being perpetually Confirmed unto him, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi>
13. 14. but by his Folly and diſobedience, his own Ruine, and utter Depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his Line, became inevitable and irrevocable. The <hi>Rule</hi> often men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
in other Treatiſes, was <hi>Gener all.</hi> That Bleſſings promiſed to any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
whileſt they were <hi>only promiſed,</hi> not <hi>confirmed by Oath,</hi> were but <hi>Mutable</hi>
                     <pb n="3149" facs="tcp:100044:92"/>
and Conditional, and the Promiſe revocable. That Curſings likewiſe, only
denounc'd by way of <hi>Threat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Promiſes or threats without Oath Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable: under Oath irrevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable.</note> not ratified by <hi>Oath;</hi> were but <hi>Conditional,</hi> were
Evitable, and the Sentence revocable. That Plagues or Bleſſings denounc'd
by <hi>Oath</hi> were <hi>Inevitable,</hi> unpreventable; Inſtances were then given in <hi>Saul;</hi>
and in the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which were cut off by <hi>Oath</hi> from entring into
the Land of Promiſe, as others were aſſured by <hi>Oath</hi> that they ſhould enter
into it.</p>
                  <p>6. Now albeit the Interpoſition of Gods <hi>Oath</hi> was alwayes an Infallible
Argument, that The Thing, which he did ſweare (were that matter of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
or of Threat, bleſſing or curſing) was Immutable; yet the Interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Oath, did not firſt <hi>make</hi> mens Eſtates, whether in his Promiſes or
in his Threates, to be <hi>Immutable;</hi> but rather <hi>declare</hi> them to be ſuch. Their
Eſtates were the one way or the other <hi>Immutable,</hi> before the Lord did ſo <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clave</hi>
them, and <hi>Immutable</hi> their Eſtates alwayes became, not by any <hi>Specifical
Qualities</hi> of the Duties performed, or of the Iniquities committed by them; but
by the <hi>Just meaſure,</hi> or full Degrees, whether of dutiful Obedience or of
diſobedience and Tranſgreſſion. The beſt Argument in this Caſe we can uſe
muſt be drawn from the <hi>Type</hi> unto the <hi>Antitype,</hi> from the Legal Shadow unto
the Evangelical Body. This kind of Argument our Apoſtle hath warranted,
and in a manner fully drawn unto our hands Heb. 3. 7. <hi>Wherefore as the Holy

alledged by the Apoſtle, would not Conclude his main Allegation,

that ſome, of whom he ſpeaks, were confirmed in the promiſe, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to be ſo confirmed by <hi>Oath;</hi> others of them were ſentenced by <hi>Oath</hi> unto
death without revocation or appeal, long before the End of life or approach
of death. <hi>Some when they had heard</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>did provoke, howbeit
not all that came out of Egypt by Moſes</hi> ver. 16. Not all that were above twenty
years old: for <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> being at that time 40 years of Age, did enter
into the Land of Promiſe after all the reſt, which were above twenty, had
periſhed in the wilderneſſe. But the Apoſtle further demands, with <hi>whom
was he grieved forty years? Was it not with them which had ſinned, whoſe carcaſes
fell in the wilderneſſe? And to whom ſware he, that they ſhould not enter into his
Reſt? but to them that believed not; ſo we ſee what they could not enter in becauſe
of unbeliefe,</hi> He ſaith not, they <hi>did not</hi> enter in becauſe of unbelief, but
they <hi>could</hi> not enter in becauſe of Unbelief. This argues that the Poſſibility
of entring in was utterly cut off, and <hi>we know it</hi> was ſo cut off <hi>becauſe the Lord
had ſworn</hi> they ſhould not enter in. But what was the true or adequate Cauſe
why they <hi>could not enter in,</hi> or why their former Poſſibility of entring in, was
utterly cut off? The Apoſtle mentioned only Two. <hi>Vnbelief</hi> and <hi>Sinne.</hi>
But are his words only to be underſtood of <hi>ordinary Sinne</hi> or <hi>Simple unbelief?</hi>
or was there any Sin or <hi>Vnbelief</hi> for <hi>Specifical Quality</hi> ſo deadly as could utterly
exclude them from all Poſſibility of entring in? or, do theſe Termes though
<hi>Indefinite</hi> in themſelves, neceſſarily Include a certain <hi>Meaſure</hi> or high <hi>Degree</hi>
of <hi>Vnbelief</hi> or <hi>Sinne.</hi> This Point may beſt be reſolved by the <hi>Historicall</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations

<hi>All thoſe men which have ſeen my Glory, and my Miracles which I did in
Egypt, and in the wilderneſſe, and have temptea me theſe ten times and have not
hearkened unto my voyce; ſurely they ſhall not ſee the Land, which I ſware unto their
Fathers, neither ſhall any of them that provoked me ſee it.</hi> They had ſeen, or
known by certain Relation, <hi>Ten ſeveral Mighty Wonders,</hi> which God had
wrought in <hi>Egypt</hi> upon <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> upon his Land and People. Now the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
and neglect of ſo many Wonders, beſides the Miracles which he had
wrought for them in the wilderneſſe, argue a great <hi>Meaſure</hi> of <hi>Diſobedience</hi> or
<hi>Vnbelief,</hi> a great <hi>Meaſure</hi> of Omiſſion or neglect of this <hi>Duty</hi> of <hi>Mortification</hi>
which is Neceſſary to <hi>All;</hi> a great <hi>Meaſure</hi> of Life ſtubbornly led after the
<hi>Fleſh;</hi> Howbeit <hi>Their Sins were most grievous,</hi> which had ſeen the <hi>Good Land,</hi>
which God had promiſed by <hi>Oath</hi> unto their Fathers, as is clear from <hi>Numb.</hi>
14. 36, 37. <hi>The men which Moſes ſent to ſearch the Land, who returned and made
all the Congregation to murmur againſt him by bringing up a ſlander upon the Land,
Even thoſe men that did bring up the evil report upon the Land, dyed by the plague be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Lord:</hi> and ſo they dyed before their brethren, which had given cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit

<hi>Caleb and Joſhua)</hi> were utterly cut off, from all Poſſibility of entring in,
before the time or hour of their death; yea they dyed before their <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary

<hi>Ye ſhall bear your Iniquities forty years. And you ſhall know my breach of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe;</hi>
that is, the Revocation of the Bleſſing promiſed.</p>
                  <p>7. That <hi>Caleb and Joſhua</hi> had their Eſtate or Intereſt in the ſame promiſe
irrevocably confirmed unto them, long before their time of their entring
into the promiſed Land, may be gathered from the Exception interſerted in
the <hi>Oath;</hi> for the Lord had ſworn that none of the reſt ſhould enter in beſides
<hi>Caleb and Joſhua.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Num. 14. 30.</note> This Exception in Ordinary Conſtruction ſeems to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
that the Lord did <hi>Poſitively ſwear,</hi> That Theſe <hi>Two</hi> ſhould enter into

not Concludent without Favourable Conſtruction, and as Lawyers ſay, <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorabiliora
ſunt amplianda;</hi> Favourable promiſes are to be taken in the ampler
Senſe. But thus we may not interpret Gods Promiſes without warrant
from Him. That Gods meaning in the former Clauſe or Exception con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> was to be taken in this <hi>Favourable</hi> and ample <hi>Senſe,</hi>
we have a further Poſitive and Concludent Proof from the Petition which
<hi>Caleb</hi> exhibited unto <hi>Joſhua,</hi> and <hi>Joſhua</hi> granted <hi>Joſh.</hi> 14. 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
<hi>Thou knoweſt</hi> (ſaith <hi>Caleb</hi> unto <hi>Joſhua) the thing that the Lord ſaid unto Moſes
the man of God concerning me and thee in Cadeſh Barnea, Moſes ſware in that day
ſaying ſurely the Land, whereon thy feet have troden, ſhall be thine inheritance and
thy Childrens for ever: becauſe thou hast wholly followed the Lord my God. And
now behold the Lord hath kept me alive as he ſaid theſe fortie and five years, even
ſince the Lord ſpake this Word unto Moſes, whileſt the Children of Iſrael wandred
in the Wilderneſſe; and now lo I am this day fourfcore and five years old: As yet I
am as ſtrong this day, as I was in the day when Moſes ſent me: as my ſtrength was
<pb n="3151" facs="tcp:100044:93"/>
then,</hi> even ſo is my <hi>ſtrength now for warre, both to go out and come in; And
Ioſhua bleſſed him, and gave unto Caleb the ſon of Iephunneh Hebron for an inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</hi>
Such is the Force and Efficacy of Gods Promiſe confirmed by <hi>Oath,</hi>
that it not only kept <hi>Caleb</hi> alive, but in the <hi>ſame ſtrength and Activity of body</hi>
till 85. years, in which he was at 40. years. It was as Remarkable in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
his life and ſtrength, as it was in bringing mortality upon others.
Yet was not his Promiſe ſo confirmed by <hi>Oath</hi> unto all that were excepted
from the Plague denounct by <hi>Oath,</hi> as it was unto <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua.</hi> For all
that were under twenty years old were excepted from the plague denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
by <hi>Oath,</hi> yet were they not all aſſured by <hi>Oath,</hi> that they ſhould enter
into the Land of Promiſe. The Exception of <hi>Them</hi> in the <hi>Oath</hi> only, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
that Poſſibility or that Intereſt, which their Fathers had in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
as Entire to them as it was at the firſt. Their <hi>Eſtate</hi> was but <hi>Conditional,</hi>
and held as it were the <hi>Mean</hi> between the Eſtate of <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> which
was Confirmed by <hi>Oath,</hi> and the Eſtate of their Forefathers, which were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
by <hi>Oath.</hi> For ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith unto the Tribe of <hi>Reuben</hi> and <hi>God,</hi> whoſe
diſobedience and backſliding he feared, Numb. 32. 14, 15. <hi>Behold ye are
riſen up in your Fathers ſtead an increaſe of ſinful men to augment yet the fierce anger
of the Lord towards Iſrael; For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again
leave them in the wilderneſs, and ye ſhall deſtroy all this people. Moſes</hi> in this
ſpeech ſuppoſeth, that theſe men were not ſo Immutably Intereſſed in Gods
Promiſe, as <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Iaſhua</hi> were: <hi>Theſe men ſtood in need of Repentance, and
their Repentance is Specified, Ver.</hi> 16, 17, 18.</p>
                  <p>But was this Decree of God Concerning <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua</hi> terminated to their
<hi>Individual Entities,</hi> or inſeparably annexed unto their Perſons before they
were born, or, did it ſuppoſe ſome <hi>Meaſure</hi> or Degree of <hi>Belief</hi> or <hi>Obedience</hi>
in them? Yes, As the others Excluſion by <hi>Oath</hi> did preſuppoſe an Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
<hi>Meaſure</hi> of Diſobedience and <hi>Vnbelief;</hi> So the Ratification of the ſame
Promiſe unto them by <hi>Oath</hi> did preſuppoſe a <hi>Meaſure</hi> more then ordinary of
<hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> Thus much is included in the reaſon of their excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the Common Plague, Numb. 32. 12. <hi>For they have wholly followed
the Lord:</hi> which Speech is likewiſe reſumed by <hi>Caleb,</hi> Joſh. 19. 9.</p>
                  <p>8. So then theſe <hi>Three Points</hi> be Clear. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That ſuch as had Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
for entring into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Three Points cleared.</note> were cut off from all Intereſt in
this Promiſe, as appeares from the words recited, Numb. 14. 34. <hi>Ye ſhall
know my breach</hi> or Nullification <hi>of my Promiſe;</hi> for Gods Promiſe could not
be Nullified or Revoked, unleſſe it had been ſincerely and really made
unto them. <hi>The Second;</hi> That this Promiſe was not only Revoked or Nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified,
but that the Parties to whom it was made, were utterly cut off from
all Hope of Poſſibility of having the like Intereſt in the Land of Promiſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
unto them, albeit they ſought the renewing of it with Tears, and
teſtified their repentance with hazard of their lives. This point is clear
from Numb. 14. 39, 40, 41. <hi>So when Moſes told all theſe ſayings unto all the
Children of Iſrael, the people mourned greatly, and they roſe up early in the morning,
&amp; gate them up into the top of the mountain, ſaying, lo we be here, &amp; will go up unto
the place, which the Lord hath promiſed; for we have ſinned. And Moſes ſaid,
wherefore do ye now tranſgreſſe the Commandement of God? But it ſhall not proſper;
go not up, for the Lord is not among you, that you be not ſmitten before your enemies.</hi>
The event did prove his words true: For when they preſumed to go up unto
the hill top, then the <hi>Amalekites came down and the Canaanites, which dwelt
in that hill, and ſmote them, and diſcomfited them even unto Horma, Numb.</hi> 14.
43, 45. Deut. 1. 41. <hi>The Third Point.</hi> That the General Promiſe wherein
<pb n="3152" facs="tcp:100044:94"/>
                     <hi>All</hi> the people had a true Intereſt, but from which <hi>moſt</hi> of them were utterly
cut off, was irrevocably ratified and confirmed unto <hi>Ioſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> upon
their <hi>Perſeverance</hi> in <hi>Belief</hi> and <hi>Obedience.</hi> The like Ratification of Gods
Promiſe upon the like Occaſion, we have in the hiſtory of <hi>Abraham. Firſt</hi>
He had Gods Promiſe that he ſhould be the <hi>Father of many Nations,</hi> that he
ſhould poſſeſſe the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but this Promiſe preſuppoſed or prere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
a <hi>Meaſure</hi> or Degree of <hi>Obedience</hi> in <hi>Abraham;</hi> for he was to forſake
his kindred and his Fathers houſe at Gods Commandement, before he could
claim Intereſt in this Promiſe. He had likewiſe fought the Battle of the
Lord, before this Promiſe was further ratified or enlarged by the <hi>Solemn
Bleſſing,</hi> which <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> beſtowed upon him in the Name of the <hi>Moſt
High God.</hi> Yet even unto this <hi>Meaſure</hi> of Obedience Gods Promiſe was not
Irrevocably Terminated, the bleſſing promiſed was not as <hi>yet</hi> ſo Immutable,
as it afterwards became. To what meaſure of Obedience then was it ſo
<hi>Immutably</hi> terminated? To his <hi>Obedience</hi> in offering up his only ſonne <hi>Iſaac;</hi>
upon this Fact the former Promiſes were ſolemnly confirmed by <hi>Oath,</hi> and
being ſo confirmed the Bleſſings promiſed could not be recalled or repealed.
By this laſt <hi>Meaſure</hi> of <hi>Belief</hi> or Obedience, that Scripture was fulfilled
which ſaith, <hi>Abraham believed God, and it was Counted unto him for Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi>
as <hi>St. Iames</hi> inſtructs us, Chapt. 2. 23. As this Fact was the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of <hi>Abrahams</hi> former <hi>Obedience;</hi> ſo the Interpoſition of Gods <hi>Oath</hi> upon
this Fact was the Full or <hi>Final Ratification</hi> of Gods former Promiſes made
unto <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. <hi>Now all theſe things</hi> (as the Apoſtle in the like Caſe ſaith) <hi>happened unto
them for Enſamples or Types, and they are written for our admonitions, upon whom
the ends of the world are come: wherefore let him that thinketh he ſtands, take heed
leſt he fall,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Every Degree of <hi>Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> an approach to the Final <hi>Ratification</hi> of the Promiſe.</note> 1. Cor. 10. 11, 12. The ſpecial Points of our Admonition or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
from the former <hi>Types</hi> or <hi>Examples</hi> may thus be gathered by war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
or Imitation of the Apoſtles Argument in the like Caſe. Whoſoever
doth in any ſort <hi>Mortifie</hi> the Deeds of the body, hath a true intereſt in this
Promiſe, <hi>[ye ſhall Live.]</hi> Every ſubſequent Degree of <hi>Mortification</hi> is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
or approach unto the <hi>Final Ratification</hi> of the Promiſe. The Bleſſing
promiſed not withſtanding is not Irrevocably ratified, the Gift of <hi>Final Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance</hi>
in this Duty, is not immutably eſtabliſhed, untill we attain unto a
certain <hi>Meaſure</hi> of <hi>Mortification,</hi> anſwering in proportion unto the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of
<hi>Abraham's</hi> Obedience, when he offered up his ſon <hi>Iſaac,</hi> or unto the Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> when the Lord ſware unto them that they ſhould
enter into the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> Again, every Degree or Portion of life
led <hi>after the fleſh,</hi> is a Degree or Approach unto the Sentence of death here
denounced; <hi>[If ye live after the fleſh ye ſhall dye.]</hi> The further we go on
in the wayes of the Fleſh, the more we endanger our Intereſt in the promiſe
of Life, the more obnoxious or lyable we become to the Sentence of death.
Howbeit the Sentence of death becomes not Irrevocable, untill we come
unto a Full <hi>Meaſure</hi> of Diſobedience, in following the wayes of the Fleſh, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering
in proportion unto the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of their Diſobedience or <hi>Vnbelief,</hi>
who were cut off from all Poſſibility of entering into the Land of Promiſe.
Again, as theſe Diſobedient men did make up the full <hi>Meaſure</hi> of their <hi>Diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience,</hi>
before they made up the full meaſure of their dayes, and as <hi>Caleb,
Ioſhua,</hi> and <hi>Abraham,</hi> did attain unto the <hi>Meaſure</hi> of <hi>Belief</hi> and Obedience,
unto which Gods Bleſſings were immutably annexed by <hi>Oath,</hi> long before
they came unto the End of their Life: So likewiſe we may come unto that
<hi>Meaſure</hi> of Diſobedience, or <hi>living after the Fleſh,</hi> unto which the Sentence
<pb n="3153" facs="tcp:100044:94"/>
of death is inevitably awarded, before we ceaſe to be in the Fleſh; and on
the otherſide we may attaine to that <hi>Meaſure</hi> of <hi>Mortification,</hi> whoſe neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<hi>Conſequent</hi> is an <hi>Immutable</hi> Eſtate in Life Spirituall, before we come to
the End of our Bodily Life. And unto this Point ſome may arrive ſooner,
others later, according to the Fervency of their Endeavours, or victorious
Conſtancy in the Service of God.</p>
                  <p>10.<note place="margin">The Objection anſwered.</note> The only <hi>Objection,</hi> that is, or can be made againſt this Reſolution or
Determination in the Point propoſed, was intimated before; the whole
ſtrength of it relyes upon thoſe places of Scripture, wherein it is ſaid, <hi>He that
continues unto the End, ſhall be ſaved:</hi> or, <hi>We are partakers of Chriſt and his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
if we Continue the Beginning of our Confidence ſtedfaſt unto the End.</hi> But
though it be True, that no man, which falls off from the <hi>Spirit</hi> unto the

yet is it never ſaid, That no man is, or can be ſo confirmed in Grace before

Ghoſt oftimes ſignifies as much as <hi>ad victoriam;</hi> and denotes that point of
time wherein we get the <hi>Victory or Conquest</hi> over the Fleſh or other enemies
of the Spirit. And the <hi>Apostles</hi> words, Hebr. 3. 14. may well beare this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation:
<hi>if we hold the beginning of our Confidence ſtedfaſt unto the End:</hi>
That is, unto the End or full <hi>Meaſure</hi> of our Confidence. And all the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
promiſes which are made unto ſuch as continue <hi>unto the End,</hi> are as often
made and conceived in this <hi>Tenour, To him that overcomes.</hi> So it is Revel. 3. 5.
<hi>He that overcometh, the ſame ſhall be cloathed in white raiment, and I will not blot
out his Name out of the Book of Life, but I will confeſſe his Name before my Father
and before his Angels.</hi> And again, ver. 12. <hi>Him that overcometh will I make
a Pillar in the Temple of my God, and he ſhall go no more out, and I will write upon
him the Name of my God, and the Name of the City of my God which is New Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;
which cometh down out of heaven from my God;</hi> And the writing of this
Name of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which cometh down from heaven upon men, imports,
it ſhall be thus written whileſt they live here on earth, or whileſt it comes
down to them, not when they aſcend in ſoul unto it. And when <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſaith,
that the <hi>Names</hi> of <hi>Clement</hi> and other his Fellow-Labourers were <hi>written
in the Book of Life,</hi> Phil. 4. 3. Queſtionleſſe his meaning is, that they were
ſo written in it, that they ſhould never be blotted out, and yet were they ſo
written long before they dyed. <hi>I ſaw</hi> (ſaith S. John) <hi>the dead ſmall and great
ſtand before God, and the Books were opened, and another Book was opened, which is
the Book of Life; and the dead were judged out of thoſe things that were written
in the Books according to their works,</hi> Rev. 20. 12.</p>
                  <p>But although men in this Life may attain unto an <hi>Immutable eſtate of Grace,</hi>
yet many finally miſſe of this <hi>Eſtate,</hi> becauſe they know not where to find

                  <p>11 Some there be, which either <hi>Expreſly,</hi> or by <hi>Inevitable Conſequence</hi> of

this kind of <hi>Diviſion,</hi> (were it ſound and Orthodoxal) every man from his

                  <p>The Truth is; There be <hi>Three Eſtates</hi> or Conditions of Men, not only in

we have in this Life, are the Two ſeveral Degrees or ſteps of our Progreſs in
Chriſtianity.</p>
                  <p>But in as much as all men be not at all times, either in the <hi>Eſtate</hi> of <hi>Election</hi>
or <hi>Reprobation,</hi> and yet all in the end become either Sheep or Goats: we muſt
obſerve <hi>Foure Eſtates</hi> of men in General.<note place="margin">Four Eſtates of men in general.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Firſt,</hi> The Eſtate of the Sons of <hi>Wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Second,</hi> The Eſtate of <hi>Reprobates.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Third,</hi> the eſtate of the Sons of God by <hi>Adoption,</hi> or <hi>Baptiſm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Fourth,</hi> The eſtate of the <hi>elect,</hi> or compleatly <hi>Regenerate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. That there is a Difference between the eſtate or Condition of the
<hi>Sons of Wrath,</hi> and the eſtate of abſolute <hi>Reprobation:</hi> A difference likewiſe
between the Eſtate or Condition of the <hi>Sons of God,</hi> &amp; the Eſtate of Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of the <hi>Elect,</hi> may be Demonſtrated form the ſeveral Eſtates or Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the Firſt Man. <hi>Adam</hi> in his Firſt eſtate was the <hi>Son of God,</hi> yet not
then in the eſtate of <hi>election,</hi> for ſo he could not have fallen ſo foully as he
did. After his <hi>Fall</hi> he was in the Sate or Condition of a <hi>Son of Wrath;</hi> Yet
not in the eſtate or condition of abſolute <hi>Reprobation,</hi> for ſo he could not
have attained unto the eſtate of <hi>election</hi> or <hi>Salvation.</hi> So then every <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate</hi>
is <hi>the Son of Wrath,</hi> but every <hi>Son of Wrath</hi> is not a <hi>Reprobate. Every elect</hi>
Perſon, or every man after election is <hi>the Son of God,</hi> but every <hi>Son of God</hi>
is not in the number of the <hi>elect.</hi> The Award allotted to every one of theſe
eſtates, is either an Act of <hi>Mercy</hi> or of <hi>Iuſtice</hi> Divine. But unto the <hi>individual
Nature,</hi> or Perſons of men, no effect of Juſtice or Mercy can be awarded:
And therefore the <hi>Individual entity or Nature of Man cannot be the Immediate
Object of the Divine Decree.</hi> No part of miſery can be determined upon any
man, or Decreed againſt him, before he be the <hi>Son of wrath</hi> or a <hi>Reprobate;</hi>
For God doth never puniſh where he is not diſpleaſed, and diſpleaſed he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be with our meer Natures. Now to be <hi>the Son of Wrath</hi> in the loweſt
degree, ſuppoſeth ſome work of <hi>Satan</hi> wrought in the party, which is the <hi>Son
of Wrath; That</hi> only makes him the <hi>Son of Wrath. Adam</hi> could not have
become the <hi>Son of Wrath</hi> unleſſe he had ſuffered the Divel to deface Gods
work in him, and to inſtamp his own image upon him. No ſon of <hi>Adam</hi>
could have been born the <hi>Child of wrath,</hi> unleſſe this work and Image of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan</hi>
had been propagated unto him by inheritance from his Father <hi>Adam.</hi>
Now, if to be the <hi>Son of Wrath</hi> in the loweſt degree preſuppoſe ſome work
of <hi>Satan,</hi> the eſtate or Condition of <hi>Reprobation</hi> alwaies includeth or preſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth
<pb n="3155" facs="tcp:100044:95"/>
a greater meaſure of <hi>Satans works;</hi> and unto this work, not unto
mens Perſons or <hi>Individuall Natures,</hi> is the Irrevocable Sentence of <hi>Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
awarded.</p>
                  <p>13. To be the <hi>Son of God</hi> includeth or preſuppoſeth more then the meer <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi>
eſſence, or Individual Subſtance of man. What more doth it Include?
It alwayes includes ſome work of God wrought in the <hi>Nature,</hi> either as an
<hi>Emanant Effect</hi> or Reſultance of his Creation; or ſome work of God produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
in man after his Birth, Conception, or Creation. <hi>Adam</hi> by Creation
was the <hi>Son of God,</hi> becauſe he was created juſt and good. And albeit there
were not <hi>two Creations,</hi> One of <hi>Adams Nature,</hi> Another of his <hi>Righteouſneſſe;</hi>
Yet was his <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> a thing Diſtinct from his <hi>Nature:</hi> Otherwiſe <hi>Adam</hi>
by his <hi>Fall</hi> had not ceaſed to be the <hi>Son of God.</hi> For after his <hi>Fall</hi> he remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the ſame man he was for <hi>Nature</hi> and Subſtance, but not the ſame man he
was for <hi>Quality.</hi> It was then his Firſt Qualification, to wit, his <hi>Righteouſneſs,</hi>
by which he was made the <hi>Son of God,</hi> and it was the loſſe of this Qualificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
which made him the <hi>Son of wrath.</hi> His <hi>Nature</hi> or ſubſtance was no
part of the <hi>Object</hi> of the Divine Decree; not Capable either of Reward or
Puniſhment, but according to the <hi>Two former Qualifications.</hi> In every Son
of <hi>Adam,</hi> which in time becomes the <hi>Son of God,</hi> there muſt be a Creation
or new production of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> by the birth of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> beſides his birth
or Conception natural, by which he becomes a <hi>man.</hi> In every <hi>Elect Perſon</hi>
there muſt be a Greater work of God, a greater meaſure of <hi>Regeneration</hi> or
of new birth, then that by which he is firſt made the <hi>Son of God. And this
Meaſare of Righteouſneſs or of Regeneration is the Immediate and Formal Object of
the Eternal Decree;</hi> or of that Eternal Rule of Divine <hi>Mercy</hi> or bounty, by
which the Immutable Eſtate of <hi>Election</hi> or of Grace is awarded.<note place="margin">Election and Reprsbation look upon Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifications.</note> The Point
then is clear as the Sun; That neither the Decree of <hi>Election</hi> or <hi>Reprobation</hi>
are terminated to the <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Individual Subſtance</hi> of men, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
or relation to their works or Qualifications. The works of <hi>Satan</hi> are
Eſſentially and formally included in the <hi>Object of Reprobation:</hi> the Works of
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to be wrought in man not for man only, are Eſſentially and Formally
included in the <hi>Object of abſolute election.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>14. That which the Authors or Favourers of the Contrary Opinion (I am
perſwaded) would have ſaid, or ſhould in reaſon ſay for Their abſolute <hi>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
or <hi>Reprobation,</hi> is only This; That albeit the works of God be eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
included in the Object of the eternal <hi>election,</hi> as the works of <hi>Satan</hi> are
in the Object of eternall <hi>Reprobation:</hi> yet God did ſo abſolutely Decree to
work theſe works, which are required to the Object of <hi>election,</hi> that it was
<hi>Neceſſary from eternity</hi> they ſhould be wrought in all the Veſſels of <hi>election.</hi>
And that he did from eternity ſo Abſolutely Decree to ſuffer <hi>Satan</hi> to work
thoſe works, which are included in the Object of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> or thoſe works
which makes men <hi>Veſſels of wrath fitted to destruction,</hi> that this Qualification
or Temper could not poſſibly be avoided. This indeed is <hi>One</hi> of the <hi>Two</hi>
main <hi>Questions,</hi> which only ought ſeriouſly to be diſcuſſed between the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians</hi>
and their <hi>Oppoſites,</hi> all the reſt are but <hi>Word-Bates,</hi> or Verbal Quarrels,
ariſing from ambiguous or Unſcholaſtick expreſſions of their Opinions or
Conceipts.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> Queſtion is already diſcuſſed, and is, Whether men in this life
ordinarily do, or may attain unto an <hi>Immutable eſtate of Grace;</hi> that is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
their <hi>election</hi> untill the hour of death be <hi>Abſolute,</hi> or but <hi>Conditional.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second,</hi> which now remains to be diſcuſſed, is, Whether this <hi>Abſolute
eſtate of election</hi> or <hi>Reprobation,</hi> during the time of this life being granted, the
<pb n="3156" facs="tcp:100044:96"/>
attaining unto the one eſtate, or falling into the other, be from <hi>eternity Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary:</hi>
ſo <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> that no man, which hath fallen or ſhall fall into the
<hi>Abſolute eſtate</hi> of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> hath had, or hath, any Poſſibility to avoid his
Fall. Or again, whether every man, that now is in the <hi>Abſolute Eſtate of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,</hi>
were ſo deſtinated to the ſame Eſtate from Eternity, that no Occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
Poſſible could prevent it. If the <hi>Arminians</hi> would yeild to the <hi>Church
of England</hi> in the <hi>Former,</hi> I think no true Member of the <hi>Church of England,</hi>
would much diſſent from them in the <hi>Latter:</hi> which may be expreſſed in
<hi>Termes</hi> perhaps more Perſpicuous, Thus: Whether God, in his Foreſight of
all mens Natures, did ſet apart or deſigne <hi>ſome Individuall eſſences</hi> or Natures,
with purpoſe to frame and fit them to be <hi>Veſſels of Honour</hi> without Poſſibility
left for them to frame themſelves to be <hi>Veſſels of diſhonour?</hi> And whether he
did, by the ſame Foreſight or Inſpection, ſet apart or deſign <hi>Other indiviau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Natures</hi> or Subſtances to be <hi>Veſſels of wrath</hi> or diſhonour, without any Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
or Will to frame or Faſhion them to be <hi>Veſſels of election?</hi> To diſcuſſe
both Queſtions, firſt in <hi>Theſt,</hi> then in <hi>Hypotheſi;</hi> that is, <hi>Firſt,</hi> whether <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction</hi>
it ſelf were <hi>Abſolutely Neceſſary</hi> from eternity. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whether the
<hi>Election</hi> of this or that man, were <hi>Abſolutely Neceſſary</hi> from the hour of his
birth or conception, or rather begins to be <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> from his <hi>progreſs in
Grace,</hi> or from his Plenary and <hi>full Converſion</hi> unto God, which ſometimes, and
in ſome men, is not accompliſhed before the hour of death?</p>
                  <p>15. No mans <hi>Election</hi> or deſignment to the <hi>Immutable ſtate of Grace</hi> can be
more <hi>Neceſſary</hi> from eternity, then his <hi>Reconciliation</hi> is. No mans <hi>Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
unto God the Father can be more <hi>Neceſſary</hi> from eternity,<note place="margin">A Sorites.</note> then his Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt
is in the Pardon purchaſed by the Son of God. No mans Intereſt in this
Pardon can be from eternity more <hi>Neceſſary,</hi> then was the death of the Son
of God. The death of the Son of God was no more <hi>Neceſſary</hi> from eternity,
then the Fall of <hi>Adam</hi> was. The <hi>Fall</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> neither was nor could be
from eternity more <hi>neceſſary,</hi> then the Firſt ſin or Tranſgreſſion was. The
<hi>Conſequences of theſe Truths are moſt neceſſary,</hi> moſt immediate, If <hi>Adam</hi> had
not Tranſgreſſed Gods Commandement, he had not fallen into the State
of Gods Wrath and curſe. If <hi>Adam</hi> had not fallen into Gods Wrath or
curſe, the Son of God had not become accurſed, had not dyed. If the Son
of God had not dyed for us, our Pardon had not been purchaſed. If our
Pardon had not been purchaſed, there had been no Reconciliation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
unto God the Father. If there had been no <hi>Reconciliation</hi> of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
to God the Father, there had been no <hi>election</hi> in Chriſt, So that though it
be moſt True, that Chriſt was <hi>Agnus occiſus ab origine mundi,</hi> the Lamb ſlain
from the beginning of the World, yet was it not neceſſary from eternity,
that this Lamb ſhould be ſlain; For Chriſts death was no more neceſſary
then <hi>Adams</hi> death or Tranſgreſſion was. Now no man, I hope well advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,
will affirm, that God did deſtinate <hi>Adams</hi> Tranſgreſſion as a <hi>neceſſary
Means</hi> that Chriſt ſhould dye, for ſo he ſhould make him the Author of ſin in
<hi>Adam,</hi> before he became the Fountain of Mercy in Chriſt. The Truth
then is; That <hi>Adam</hi> having ſinned, not of neceſſity, but <hi>Freely;</hi> God, out of
his <hi>Free Mercy</hi> and Compaſſion towards man-kind, did deſtinate the <hi>Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Paſſion,</hi> of his only Son, as the <hi>Only Means</hi> of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
and Reconciliation to himſelf. And did likewiſe Deſtinate the
Conſecration of his Son (by his death) unto his <hi>everlaſting Priesthood,</hi> as the
only means for the accompliſhing of our Redemption, that is, for making
our <hi>election ſure and Abſolute.</hi> As Chriſts Prieſthood is then moſt unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and moſt <hi>neceſſary,</hi> yet was it not <hi>neceſſary</hi> from eternity that he ſhould
<pb n="3157" facs="tcp:100044:96"/>
be made a Prieſt by the ſuffering of death: So our eſtate of <hi>election</hi> in him is
moſt Abſolute and <hi>neceſſary</hi> after we attain unto it; yet was it not neceſſary
from eternity that we ſhould attain unto it; not abſolutely neceſſary that
any ſhould attain unto it, but <hi>neceſſary</hi> only upon <hi>Suppoſal</hi> of <hi>Adams</hi> Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion
(which was no way <hi>neceſſary,</hi> but <hi>Free</hi> and Contingent:) and of
Gods infinite wiſdom and mercie in ſending Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</p>
                  <p>16. If no mans Deſtination or deſignment to the Abſolute State of <hi>election</hi>
in Chriſt were abſolutely <hi>neceſſary</hi> from Eternity, but <hi>neceſſary</hi> only upon
the Suppoſals laſt made, which were not <hi>neceſſary;</hi> much leſs was the Deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of any mans <hi>Individual nature</hi> or Perſon to the Abſolute State of <hi>Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation</hi>
or damnation abſolutely <hi>neceſſary</hi> from Eternity. Damnation, as all
grant, is the end of Sin, or rather an endleſſe miſery, into which no man
can fall but by ſin, whence if this endleſs miſery had been abſolutely <hi>neceſſary</hi>
from Eternity or Decreed by God as the Goal of any mans Courſe of life;
the means likewiſe or only way by which men come unto this end or Goal
muſt have been by a like degree of <hi>neceſſity</hi> deſtinated and decreed by God;
and the only way or means, by which men come unto this end, is ſin:
So that God, by this Opinion or Doctrine, ſhould have been as Immediate
a <hi>Cauſe of Sin</hi> and death, as he is of the Puniſhment of ſins, or of non-Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
for ſins, committed. And this is <hi>Contrary to the fundamental Principles
of Chriſtianity,</hi> of <hi>Religion it ſelf:</hi> By both which we are taught, that God,
as a Righteous Judge, is the ſole Author of the Decree or Sentence againſt
impenitent ſinners, but no Cauſe at all, no Author of their ſins or Impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency,
and therefore <hi>no Cauſe,</hi> much leſſe any <hi>neceſſary Cauſe</hi> of any mans
Falling into the Abſolute ſtate of <hi>Reprobation.</hi> Our Saviour Chriſt, as then
deſigned to be the Future Judge of quick and dead, did pronounce that <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Sentence</hi> againſt <hi>Judas,</hi> and againſt him alone for ought we read; <hi>It were
good for that man if he had never been born.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Judas not Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated from Eternity.</note> We may hence ſafely conclude,
that <hi>Judas</hi> from that time was in the Abſolute State of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> and had
now deſerved (without hope of Pardon) this fearfull Sentence, as having
now reſolved in his heart without Remorſe or Compunction, to betray the
Son of God into the hands of ſinners. He became an <hi>Abſolute Reprobate</hi> by
reſolving to betray the Son of God; he did <hi>not reſolve</hi> to betray the Son of
God, becauſe he was an <hi>Abſolute Reprobate</hi> from Eternity or from his birth.
He was not lyable to this wofull Sentence from his birth or in his Infancy;
for if it had been better for him from his birth or from his calling to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle-ſhip,
not to have been born at all, or not to have been ſo called; God
howſoever moſt gracious and good in himſelf, had not been good or
gracious unto <hi>Judas</hi> in giving him Being, in making him an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> ſeeing it
had been much better for him not to have been either a Man or an <hi>Apoſtle,</hi>
if from the time of his <hi>Birth</hi> or <hi>Apoſtle-ſhip</hi> he had been inevitably deſigned
to the abſolute eſtate of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> to a greater meaſure of everlaſting pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments
then other men ordinarily are. But the Truth is, the greater mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of his <hi>puniſhment</hi> did preſuppoſe a greater meaſure of his <hi>unthankfulneſs,</hi>
&amp; the greater meaſure of his unthankfulneſs (in reſpect of other men) did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſe
a greater meaſure of Gods Favour and goodneſs towards him, in
giving him birth and being in the days of his Sons Incarnation, or in calling
him to the Fellowſhip of his <hi>Apoſtles</hi> or <hi>Ambaſſadors.</hi> And thus we come a
<hi>Theſiad Hypotheſin</hi> from the general Speculative Truth unto the Particular
Uſe or Application.</p>
                  <p>17. All of us do (I am perſwaded) unfeignedly acknowledge our ſelves
to have been by Naturall birth the <hi>Sons of wrath;</hi> and to be the <hi>ſons of wrath,</hi>
                     <pb n="3158" facs="tcp:100044:97"/>
includes in it ſome work of <hi>Satan,</hi> wrought not in <hi>Adam</hi> only, but in our
<hi>Nature,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Satans work two-fold, Sin, and Curſe</note> which we derive from him; and <hi>this work of Satan is Twofold: Sin
Original,</hi> and <hi>the Curſe</hi> thereunto annexed; this Latter Part, to wit the Curſe,
muſt be diſſolved by <hi>Faith,</hi> as by the Inſtrument: <hi>For he that believeth not,</hi>
ſaith S. John Chap. 3. ver. 36. <hi>ſhall not ſee life, but the wrath of God abideth on
him;</hi> that is, It was upon him from his <hi>Firſt Being,</hi> and reſts upon him until
it be removed by <hi>Faith in the Son of God.</hi> Now in that this work of <hi>Satan</hi>
(that is, the Curſe due to Sin Original) is removed by <hi>Faith</hi> in the Son of
God, the Son of God is the Principal Cauſe or Agent which removes it by his
<hi>Sacerdotal</hi> or Princely Bleſſing upon our <hi>Miniſterial Act</hi> or Function of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.
It is a Truth unqueſtionable (eſpecially in the Doctrine of the
Church of England) that as many, as are <hi>Baptized,</hi> are <hi>from</hi> their Baptiſm,
and <hi>by</hi> their Baptiſm tranſlated from the Eſtate or Condition of <hi>Sons of wrath,</hi>
to the Eſtate or Priviledge of <hi>the Sons of God.</hi> This Doctrine of our Church
is neceſſarily grounded upon the Saying of our Apoſtle <hi>Gal. 3. 27. As many
of you, as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Chriſt.</hi> Now it is impoſſible
that any ſhould put on Chriſt and not receive him. <hi>And to as many as receive
him</hi> (ſaith S. John cap. 1. ver. 12.) <hi>to them he gives power (Right, or Priviledge)
to become the Sons of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18. But here ſome will demand, If all that are Baptized become the <hi>ſons
of God,</hi> do they not all likewiſe by this new birth become <hi>heires with Chriſt?</hi>
Yes, <hi>all that are Sons are likewiſe Heirs,</hi> but not therefore un-diſinheritable,
becauſe heirs; not therefore in the eſtate of <hi>abſolute election,</hi> becauſe they
are in the eſtate of the <hi>ſons of God,</hi> or heirs with Chriſt by Baptiſm. For
many, whom God hath graciouſly accepted for his ſons; many, who du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the time of their Infancy have enjoyed the eſtate or Priviledge of the
<hi>ſons of God,</hi> may in riper years turn <hi>Prodigal</hi> ſons, and diſinherit themſelves;
and none can be diſinherited but he that hath been in the eſtate or Condition
of an Heire; or untill with <hi>Eſau</hi> he have <hi>ſold his birth-right.</hi> Both parts of
this Aſſertion, [That all that are <hi>Baptized</hi> in their Infancy, become the <hi>Sons
of God,</hi> and during their Infancy do <hi>live to God.]</hi> 2. That <hi>Sin</hi> even in ſuch,
may <hi>revive,</hi> and wound, ſome grievouſly, others mortally,] are included
in our Apoſtles diſpute, Rom. 7. 9. <hi>I was once alive,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle,)
<hi>without the Law: but when the Commandement came ſin revived, and I dyed.</hi>
Doth he ſpeak this of <hi>himſelf only,</hi> or of <hi>all men</hi> without exception or
reſtraint that were without the Law? <hi>Not Abſolutely of all</hi> Men that
were without the Law; for ſo the Gentiles, which were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Law, which knew not God, nor his Lawes, ſhould have been ſo
alive, as the <hi>Apostle</hi> there ſaith, he ſometimes was; becauſe they were more
without the Law, then he at any time was. <hi>Nor doth he ſpeake this of himſelf
alone,</hi> but of all ſuch as he was; That is, of all ſuch, and only ſuch, as were
the <hi>Seed of Abraham,</hi> and had been circumciſed the 8<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. day, and by Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion
became <hi>under the Law,</hi> though for the preſent without the Law. So
that as <hi>Baptiſm</hi> now, ſo <hi>circumciſion</hi> then did free the Children of <hi>Abraham</hi>
from the curſe of the Law; did Tranſlate them from the eſtate or Condition
of the <hi>Sons of wrath,</hi> to the Condition or Priviledge of the <hi>Sons of God.</hi> But did
the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> or his brethren which were made alive by <hi>Circumciſion</hi> in their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
continue in the ſame eſtate of Life untill their mortal Lives end? No,
The Apoſtle expreſly adds, <hi>But when the Commandement came, ſin revived and
I dyed.</hi> So that ſin, before the Commandement came, was dead: and revived
when the Law came. And the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> before the ſame point of time was
alive; but then dyed. When then did the commandement come, which
<pb n="3159" facs="tcp:100044:97"/>
by its coming did bring life to ſin, and death to this our <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> and ſuch as
he was? It is an <hi>Obſervation of very good Vſe,</hi> which S. <hi>Baſil</hi> hath to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
in his Comment upon the firſt Pſalm:<note place="margin">See S. Baſil's words at the End of this Chapter.</note>

<hi>When our Reaſon comes once to ripeneſs or perfection, That is fulfilled which is written:

For when ſuch as have ſubmitted themſelves to the Law of God
come to the uſe of Reaſon, or to take their Eſtate into Conſideration, they
begin to examine their Conſciences by the Law of God; and ſin, which was
before <hi>Inherent,</hi> though quiet, being called in Queſtion, grows deſperate
and rebellious againſt the <hi>Law,</hi> by which it is examined; againſt the <hi>Judge,</hi>
which condemns it; &amp; againſt the <hi>Party</hi> which calls it in Queſtion. The Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
as well of our <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſpeech, as of S. <hi>Baſils</hi> Obſervation upon it,
confirms the Truth,<note place="margin">Chap. 29. n. 5.</note> which was before delivered in <hi>the Treatiſe of Mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi>
That the ſame meaſure of Regeneration, which ſufficeth during the
time of Infancy or Childhood, ſufficeth not to ſave the ſame Parties when
they come to Uſe of Reaſon or Conſideration; for then the Commandement
comes upon us, a Commandement to <hi>Mortifie the deeds of the Fleſh by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi>
to enter the <hi>Liſts</hi> or Combate with ſin reviving in us, which will certainly
kill us, unleſs we mortifie it, as it reviveth in us; or quell it as it rebells a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
us. So that the eſtate or Condition of ſuch as have been baptized,
after once they come to the uſe of Reaſon, is an eſtate different from their
eſtate in their Infancy or Childhood; an eſtate likewiſe different ordinarily
from the Abſolute eſtate of <hi>Election.</hi> But of this eſtate, and of our Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
demeanour in it, I ſhall now only ſay thus much in Generall. This <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification

Service,</hi> which the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> requires. Rom. 12. 1. <hi>I beſeech you therefore
brethren by the mercies of God, that you preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice, holy, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable
unto God, which is your Reaſonable Service.</hi> But why a <hi>Reaſonable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice?</hi>
In oppoſition to the Service of the Law, which did conſiſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of Buls and Goats and other <hi>Reaſonleſs Creatures,</hi> which yet were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red

ſpeaks, Heb. 9. 14.) ſhall throughly <hi>purge our Conſciences from dead

this <hi>Reaſonable ſervice</hi> or offering up of our ſelves, We were conſecrated by
Baptiſm,<note place="margin">This was a Sermon preacht upon the <hi>Epiphanie,</hi> as I take it.</note> and bound by ſolemn vow then made; and if we continue conſtant
in performing this <hi>Vow</hi> after we come to riper years, we ſhall continue in the

was, that he might thus <hi>lead us on from ſtrength to ſtrength, untill we appear
before our God in Sion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Doctrine of Mortification (and the conſequences thereof) were it thus
Taught, and Laid to the Conſciences of Chriſtian People as a main Part of
their Baptiſmal Vow, and preſſed home as a Duty that concernd their everla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting
Salvation, would, by Gods Bleſſing, be likely to prove fruitfull, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
it is uſefull. For ſomewhat to enlarge that which hath been Toucht
on,<note place="margin">The uſe of the former Doct. to condemn ſloth: to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</note> in the foregoing Chapter, this may be more particularly conſidered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It leaves Sloth and Negligence in this <hi>Good Dutie</hi> &amp; of ſo high Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
clean without excuſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Being rightly applyed it ſerves as an <hi>Antidote</hi> both againſt Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
and Deſpair.</p>
                  <p>20. There is no way to make a Coward Hardie or Reſolute in ſight, but by
putting him upon ſome manifeſt exigent or apparent Neceſſity either of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
his Adverſary, or of being killed by him. So long as there is hope to
eſcape by Flight, or <hi>Non-appearance,</hi> it is a matter almoſt impoſſible to make
a Timorous ſpirit try his ſtrength or ability. The foes or enemies with
whom we are here enjoyned to fight, are our own <hi>Bodies,</hi> or, our own <hi>Fleſh,</hi>
which ſtill fighteth againſt our ſoules; from whoſe aſſaults there is no poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of flight. There is an apparent Neceſſity layd upon us either of kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
<hi>the Deeds of the Body,</hi> or of being more then killed by them. For if we
<hi>Live after the fleſh,</hi> or ſuffer the works of the Fleſh or deeds of the Body to
live or raign in us, <hi>we ſhall dye</hi> the death of the Soul. Did we truly appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the Neceſſity of this choyce, how were it poſſible for us to deferre this
Conflict with our own fleſh for <hi>one Moment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>21. Some not withſtanding there be which ſee in part this <hi>neceſsity of dying,
by living after the fleſh,</hi> and yet ſubmit their Wills and Affections unto the
deſires and luſts of the Fleſh, as <hi>Men Condemned</hi> by Law do their Bodies
to the Officers of Juſtice or Executioners. This, <hi>Theſe</hi> poor ſouls do; Some out
of Conſcience, becauſe they hold it unlawfull to reſiſt Authority; Some out
of weakneſſe, as being not able to prevail, if they ſhould ſtruggle with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
But neither of theſe Motives can have place in the former Caſe.
For <hi>Firſt,</hi> the Conflict or Reſiſtance of the Fleſh is not only Lawful but neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary;
<hi>ſo neceſſary,</hi> that if after our promiſe in Baptiſm and participation of
the word and Sacraments we neglect the undertaking of this warre <hi>with our
own bodies,</hi> we are in the ſame caſe that Souldiers are, which after they have
received Preſſe-money and good pay, run from their Colours. We juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre
the Sentence of everlaſting death, by not ſeeking to put the Deeds of
this mortal Body to death. We become perpetuall ſlaves to Satan, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
to fight with ſin, which is Chriſts enemy, and Satans Agent.</p>
                  <p>22. Nor can we pretend that our endeavours to <hi>mortifie</hi> the Deeds of the
Body are hopeleſs, or vain, becauſe <hi>we are not able of our ſelves to think a good
thought,</hi> much leſs to give good ſucceſs to our beſt endeavours. For the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle</hi>
(as you heard before) enjoynes <hi>us to work out our Salvation with feare and
trembling,</hi> that is, as men afraid to be idle or ſlothfull for <hi>a moment;</hi> even
for this Reaſon, <hi>Becauſe it is God that worketh in us both the Will and the deed.</hi>
And though the ſame Apoſtle hath elſewhere ſaid, <hi>That it is not of him that
willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy;</hi> yet it is <hi>a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
Rule</hi> in Divinity, <hi>Finis dicendorum eſt ratio dictorum,</hi> our <hi>Apoſtles ſpeech</hi>
muſt be taken from the <hi>end or General Scope</hi> at which he aimed. To what <hi>end</hi>
                     <pb n="3161" facs="tcp:100044:98"/>
then doth our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> give us the former or like <hi>Rule?</hi> To the <hi>end</hi> that we ſhould
not will or deſire our <hi>Mortification,</hi> nor run with alacrity towards the Goal;
which in every Epiſtle he ſets Before us, to wit the <hi>Mortification</hi> of the Fleſh
and life of the Spirit? or rather to kindle our deſires to <hi>work,</hi> and ſtir up our
alacrity in <hi>working,</hi> yet ſo, as we ſtill rely not upon our works or indeavours,
but meerly upon the <hi>Good will and mercy of our God.</hi> He that ſaith,<note place="margin">See Chapt. 41. &amp; 42.</note> 
                     <hi>It is not of
him that willeth, nor of him that runneth; but of God that ſheweth mercy,</hi> did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
ſay, that it was not the Good Will or Pleaſure of God to ſhew <hi>Mercy
unto all,</hi> that abandoning all other wayes run with what ſpeed and alacrity
they can unto his Mercy. He that ſaith, <hi>God will have mercy upon whom he
will have mercy, and whom he will he hardneth;</hi> did never ſay, that it was Gods
Will to harden any which deny themſelves and their own doings, and whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
betake themſelves to his Infinite Goodneſs. His meaning, (ſure) in
that place is, that as God will have mercy on none that ſeek ſalvation by
works or other prerogatives of the fleſh, ſo he wil harden none that put their
confidence, not it their works, but in his mercy.</p>
                  <p>23. The Summe of all that can in this Point be ſaid, is; That no man can
be partaker of the promiſe of Life, but he that faithfully ſeeks for <hi>Mercy</hi> in
Chriſt Jeſus. And no man can faithfully ſeek for mercy in Chriſt, but he
that ſincerely renounceth his own works and merits. And no man can ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
and truly renounce his own works and merits, but he that is indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
and laborious in theſe works of <hi>Mortification here enjoyned</hi> Hypocrites
and ungodly perſons will be ready in the day of Tryall, <hi>to deny all hopes of
ſalvation by works,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chapt. 36.</note> 
                     <hi>or confidence in merits.</hi> But, as was intimated before, <hi>No
man can be truly ſaid to renounce thoſe good works,</hi>
                     <note place="margin"> paragr. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>which he hath left undone, but
thoſe works which he hath done.</hi> No man can truly deny himſelf but he that exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſeth
himſelf in theſe works of <hi>Mortification.</hi> We cannot poſſibly know our
own Impotency or want of ſtrength to perform theſe works of <hi>Mortification</hi>
as we ought, unleſs we make proof or triall of our ſtrength in working
them as we can. The more we try our ſtrength, the more inſufficient ſhall
we find our ſelves; and the better Experience we have of our own Inſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency,
the more earneſtly will we (if we do as we ought, for our own good)
crave the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit: the more Faithfully will we rely on Chriſt,
who is our ſtrength and the Rock of our Salvation, and ſo not preſume.</p>
                  <p>24. Again, The <hi>former Doctrine is uſeful to prevent Deſpair</hi> in the dayes of
Temptation; Albeit we find our Tranſgreſſions of this precept to be great
and many. Our Apoſtle ſaith not, <hi>If ye have lived after the fleſh, ye ſhall dye;</hi>
for ſo no fleſh ſhould be ſaved. But his words are; <hi>if ye live after the fleſh,
ye ſhall dye.</hi> If any man find his Conſcience burdened with an heavy load of
the works of the Fleſh, let him not take the frights, no nor the Scarres of
Conſcience wounded by ſins paſt, or the impreſſions by ſin preſent, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
marks of <hi>Reprobation;</hi> yet let him call to mind, as often as he findes
himſelf prone to the works of the Fleſh, <hi>that he may fall into Reprobation before
he be aware,</hi> if he continue ſecure in that Courſe of life, which formerly be
hath taken; let him withall remember, that <hi>Praeterita non nocent ſi praeſentia
non placent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the Otherſide; is there any man whoſe Conſcience can truly inform
him that he hath ſincerely laboured to <hi>mortifie the deeds of the Body?</hi> his Faith
upon this Information will aſſure him that he is in the way of Life, and
that in <hi>pat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>eni Continuance in Well-doing,</hi> he ſhall be a <hi>Veſſel unto honour, and</hi>
make <hi>his election ſure,</hi> But let not any man hence Conclude that he is already in
the <hi>Immutable ſtate of Grace.</hi> For our Apoſtle doth not ſay, <hi>if ye have morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
<pb n="3162" facs="tcp:100044:99"/>
the deeds of the body by the ſpirit, ye are in the Immutable ſtate of Life;</hi> but he
ſaith; <hi>if ye mortifie the Deeds of the Body, ye ſhall live:</hi> that is, <hi>if ye Continue to
mortifie the deeds of the Body,</hi> God will <hi>Continue</hi> the bleſſings and means of life
unto you, yea <hi>Confirm</hi> you in the Immutable State of Life and ſaving
Grace.</p>
                  <p>25. If any man liſt to examine himſelf, whether he be <hi>in the ſtate of Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi>
or <hi>Reprobation,</hi> let him meaſure or moderate his perſwaſions of the one
or other Eſtate, by his proficiency or negligence <hi>in this duty of Mortification.</hi>
Otherwiſe to be prepoſſeſt with ſtrong perſwaſions of being in the <hi>Immutable
State of Grace or Election,</hi> before we have <hi>given all diligence to make our election
ſure, by performing this Duty of Mortification,</hi> is the readieſt or moſt compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious
way that Satan yet hath found out, to caſt men into <hi>a Reprobate Senſe,</hi>
that is, to make them without ſenſe or feeling of their ſinnes: or, which is
worſe, to miſperſwade them, that <hi>thoſe very Deeds,</hi> whileſt done by <hi>Them,</hi> are
<hi>no ſins,</hi> or <hi>ſins of Infirmity only,</hi> which being done by <hi>Others</hi> are even in their
Judgements groſſe and <hi>Capital ſins.</hi> The Method, by which Sathan works
this miſperſwaſion in men (ſtrongly perſwaded of their own <hi>Immutable ſtate
of Grace,</hi> before their due time) is Immutable and Infallible. For it is an
Infallible Rule in Logick and Nature; That, <hi>An Vniverſal Negative may be
Simply converted.</hi> If no rich man (whilſt a rich man) can be a begger, then
no begger (whilſt he is a begger) can be a rich man. If no convetous, no proud,
no envious, no ſeditious or uncharitable man, no doer of any of thoſe works
of the Fleſh mentioned by S. Paul, Gal. 5. can enter into the Kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
Then no man, whoſe entrance into it is Immutably determined, can be a
covetous, an evious, ſeditious or uncharitable man. Whence, if a man be
once perſwaded, that his entrance into the Kingdome of heaven, or his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate
in Grace is unchangable, he cannot poſſibly perſwade himſelf, or be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
by others, that he is a covetous, proud, envious, ſeditious or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable
man, albeit he do all the works that a covetous, proud, envious,
ſeditious or uncharitable man doth.</p>
                  <p>26. Laſtly, although it be the ſafeſt way to examine our <hi>Eſtate in Grace</hi> by our
diligence in <hi>this duty of Mortification;</hi> yet I muſt admoniſh men not to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
their proficiency or progreſs in performance of this Duty by <hi>Meer Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence
from</hi> the works of the Fleſh, which they ſincerely diſlike or condemn
in others. I know we condemn the <hi>blind obedience of the Roman Catholicks,</hi>
that are ready to do and believe as the Church commands them, without
examination, as a work of the Fleſh, of which we are Freed; yet this doth
not argue that we have <hi>mortified</hi> this work of the Fleſh, this <hi>Blind Obedience,</hi>
unleſſe our Conſciences can truly inform us that we are ready to obey the
Church our Mother in things lawfull, or in things, which upon diligent exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
are not Evill, but Indifferent.</p>
                  <p>We likewiſe condemn, as wel the <hi>affected Ignorance</hi> of the Romiſh Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick,
in that, though he may, yet he regards not to hear the Word preached
in a Language that he knows, as his <hi>blind Devotion,</hi> in that he can be content to
make his Prayers, or to hear publick Prayers in a Language that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
not, for works of the Fleſh. In both theſe we do well: yet are
neither of <hi>theſe works</hi> truly <hi>mortified</hi> in us by the Spirit, unleſſe we be as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
and zealous to joyne with the Congregation in <hi>publick Prayers of the Church</hi>
celebrated in a known Tongue, as we are to hear or read Sermons. The
Miniſters muſt preach, that the people may know how to pray aright in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate.
And the people muſt joyn with them in <hi>Publick Prayers appointed by
the Church,</hi> that both may practiſe according to the Rules of Life
<pb n="3163" facs="tcp:100044:99"/>
delivered whether by the word read or preached. The <hi>Communion of Saints,</hi>
or that part of it, which can be had betvvixt Saints here on earth, doth ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially
conſiſt, in the Unity of Faith, and of Prayers publikely celebrated
according to the Common Rule of Faith.</p>

                  <p>The Doctrinal <hi>Points</hi> to be diſcuſſed are <hi>Two.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> Vnto what Condemnation they were of Old ordained.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> How, or in what manner they were ordained unto it.</p>
                  <p>2. <q>There is <hi>An Engliſh Note</hi> upon this Place, A very ſtrange One, yet
gathered as it ſeems from ſome good Writers, vvho did not ſo clearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
themſelves in their Comments upon this Place as might have been
deſired,<note place="margin">See the 1. note at the end of this Chapter.</note> and yet are farre vvorſe underſtood by many of their Follovvers,
then they meant. <hi>The Engliſh Note</hi> ſeems to imply, that theſe men
were <hi>Ordained to trouble the Church,</hi> or to follow thoſe lewd Opinions or
Practiſes, whereby the Church was troubled, and the Faith of many
brought into manifeſt hazard.</q> Yet to ſay, that any man is <hi>ordained by God</hi>
to this or the like end, will be very harſh to any Chriſtian eares, and was
(I am perſwaded) either a branch of their Hereſy, which are here ſaid to be
<hi>ordained to Condemnation;</hi> or a Branch of the ſame Root, worſe then any
Hereſy,<note place="margin">God ordains no man to ſin.</note> which they maintained. And yet to ſay, <hi>That men are ordained to
trouble the Church,</hi> to be ungodly, and to deny Chriſt, is but the <hi>Neceſſary Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent</hi>
of their Opinion, who hold, <hi>That all things, every Action of Man, even
ſinfull Actions, are ſo ordained and determined by God, that they cannot come to paſs
<pb n="3165" facs="tcp:100044:100"/>
otherwiſe then they do in the Individual; either for the Matter &amp; Subſtance, or for the
circumſtance of the action.</hi> Thus to write &amp; thus to ſpeak, ſome are emboldened,
becauſe nothing can fall out without Gods <hi>Foreſight,</hi> yea without his <hi>Co-opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi>
For in him <hi>all things</hi> living do <hi>live,</hi> all things endued with motion do
<hi>move, and have their being.</hi> And in that nothing can be done without him, in
that he is <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> and ſupporteth the world by the Word of his Power;
they do not collect amiſſe that they cannot lay a load too heavy upon him.
But they ſhould conſider,<note place="margin">God is no leſſe holy and juſt then powerful.</note> that ſeeing he is <hi>Holy and Just;</hi> no leſſe Holy and
Juſt, then he is <hi>Powerfull,</hi> they may lay that upon him, which is a great deal
too foul for him to bear. The fouleſt Aſperſion, that can be caſt upon his
<hi>Holineſs,</hi> is to make him the <hi>Author of ſinful Actions;</hi> To ſay or think <hi>he did
Ordain men to trouble the Church,</hi> or <hi>to be</hi> (as theſe men were) <hi>ungodly Perſons,
denyers of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. To avouch in plain Terms, That <hi>God is the Author of ſin,</hi> is, as moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe,
a dangerous Hereſy, a ſign of a <hi>darkned mind</hi> in ſpiritual knowledge.
And yet the blindneſſe or ignorance would be more groſs, if any man
ſhould grant the <hi>Antecedent,</hi> and deny the <hi>Conſequent.</hi> That is, if one ſhould
grant, that God did ordain any man to perſecute the Church, to turn his
<hi>Grace into wantonneſs;</hi> and yet withall deny that God in thus doing ſhould be
the cauſe and <hi>Author of Sin.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See the 6. Chapter.</note> 
                     <q>He that is the Author or Cauſe of any
Action which is Eſſentially evill, or, univerſally inſeparable from evill, is
the Author and Cauſe of all the evill which is inſeparable from the Action,
even in that he is the Cauſe of the Action. For that which they call the
<hi>Obliquity</hi> of the Action, or <hi>Malum Formale, Formally Evill,</hi> can have no
other cauſe at all, then that, which is the Cauſe of the Action, from which
this <hi>Formal evill</hi> is unſeparable.</q> So that if Gods <hi>Ordinance</hi> be the Neceſſary
Cauſe of ſuch an Action, to wit, of <hi>Troubling the Church,</hi> the ſame <hi>Ordinance</hi>
muſt be the cauſe of the <hi>Obliquity</hi> or evill, which is annexed unto it. <hi>Satan</hi> and
wicked men ſhould be but Cauſes Inſtrumental at moſt; that is, ſuch a cauſe
as the ſword is of the murther, which a man commits with it. So that the
Caſe is clear, that if to <hi>trouble the Church with lewd Opinions</hi> be a ſinfull Action,
then God, who is no Author of Sin, did never ordain men unto that action;
For whatſoever God doth ordain or decree,<note place="margin">God is Author of that which be ordaineth.</note> he is the Author of it. Theſe
Inferences will admit no Plea or Traverſe amongſt ſuch, as are inſtructed in
the Fundamentall Rules of Art or Nature: For all do grant, that which they
call <hi>Obliquity,</hi> or <hi>Formal Evil,</hi> to be a <hi>Relation,</hi> that is, ſuch an entity, or <hi>Being</hi> unto
which no Action can be immediatly terminated; it hath its Being only by
Concomitance or reſultance from ſome other Effect, which hath a direct and
Immediate Cauſe. Of this Nature are Equality or Inequality of bodies; Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militude
or Diſſimilitude. Now it is impoſſible that man or Angel, or any
Cauſe whatſoever, ſhould produce an Equality between two bodies formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
unequal, by any other means then by altering the Quantity of one or both;
or to make one body diſlike unto another but by altering their Qualities.
Altogether as <hi>Impoſſible</hi> it is to produce an <hi>Obliquity</hi> or Crookedneſs in mens
wayes, by any other means then by producing thoſe Actions, which are <hi>in
their Nature Perverſe</hi> and crooked. He which is the Cauſe of ſuch Actions
in the Individual, is the Cauſe of that crookedneſs or Obliquity, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparably
annext unto them.</p>
                  <p>4. That <hi>God is not the Cauſe,</hi> not the Author of ſuch Actions, or that ſuch
Actions are not neceſſary in reſpect of his Decree, <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> it ſelf or the
Rule of Catholick Faith binds us to believe, as firmly, as that there is a <hi>God,</hi>
who is the Author or Fountain of Goodneſſe. Hence ſaith St. James, Cap. 1.
<pb n="3166" facs="tcp:100044:101"/>
ver. 13. <hi>Let no man ſay when he is tempted, he is tempted of God, for God cannot
be tempted with evill, neither tempteth he any man unto evil; but every man is
tempted when he is drawn away of his own luſt, and inticed.</hi> And unto this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience
of being tempted by his own luſt, man was not ſubject untill he
was beguiled by Satan; nor could this great tempter work evill in man im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly
or directly, but only by tempting or inticing him to that Action, to
which evill was unſeparably annexed, that is, to <hi>tast of the fruit,</hi> which God
had <hi>forbidden.</hi> The Tempter knew, that if he could intice our firſt Parents
unto this Action, there was no poſſibility of ſhedding the Obliquity or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
evil from it, which was eſſentially annext unto it. Now if God had
ordained man to this Individuall Action, or to the condemnation which was
due to this Action, without poſſibility of avoiding it, His <hi>Ordination</hi> had been
a more true Cauſe of the firſt mans ſin and of his death and ours, then Satan
was. For <hi>Satan</hi> had no power either naturall or permitted him by God, to
make any ordinance or decree for man, no power either given or permitted
to lay a neceſſity of ſinning upon our firſt Parents. All that he was able, or
permitted, to do, was only by way of temptation or inticement. <hi>Adam,</hi> as
all grant, had a <hi>Freedom of Will</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Satan</hi> or any inticement, that he
could propoſe unto him: But Freedom of Will he could have had none
in reſpect of <hi>Gods Decree</hi> or Ordination, if it were true that God had ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him to eat the Forbidden fruit. For the Rule is moſt certain, <hi>That God is
the Cauſe and Author of whatſoever he Ordains men to do;</hi> and hence we read,
<hi>that God hath Ordained us to good works,</hi> to <hi>newneſs of Life,</hi> to the performance
of all thoſe duties, which are commanded. But we never read in Scripture
(and let it never be read in any other Book, but with indignation; let it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
be ſpoken or thought upon by any Chriſtian, but with deteſtation) <hi>that
God ſhould ordain men to walk in the ways of Cain,</hi> or to tread in the pathes of
ungodlineſs. The Concluſion then is firm and ſound, <hi>That theſe men here
mentioned in St. Jude,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The concluſion of the firſt point.</note> 
                     <hi>were not ordained to trouble the Church, but ordained, and
that of old, unto that Condemnation which is due, to ſuch as trouble the Church, or
to ungodlineſs;</hi> And that is a fearfull condemnation as <hi>St. Jude</hi> expreſſeth it,
ver 13. For <hi>to them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is reſerved the blackneſs of darkneſs for ever.</hi>
And if this were reſerved unto them, or for them, they were firſt ordained
unto it; the Sentence was already paſt upon them, albeit the Execution be
deferred untill the <hi>Judgment of the great day.</hi> But unto this condemnation
they were ordained, becauſe they had <hi>followed the ways of Cain,</hi> and <hi>run greedily
after the error of Balaam,</hi> as St. <hi>Iude</hi> tels us, ver. 11. But farre be it from us
to think that they were ordained to follow the ways of <hi>Cain,</hi> who was the
firſt troubler of the Church, that they might be condemned. And thus
much of the <hi>Firſt point, what Condemnation</hi> is here meant, or unto what they
<hi>were ordained;</hi> That was not to trouble the Church, but to <hi>everlaſting tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>
for troubling the Church by wicked Lives and Lewd Opinions.</p>
                  <p>5.<note place="margin">The ſecond Point.</note> The Second Generall was, <hi>What Ordination is here meant,</hi> or in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
theſe men are ſaid to be <hi>ordained</hi> to this <hi>Condemnation.</hi> Many take it as
granted, that, <hi>Ordination to everlaſting death,</hi> is, the very ſame that <hi>Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
is; Yet if this were a time, or this a place fitting for diſcuſſion of this
point it might be eaſily made to appear, that although <hi>Reprobation</hi> include
ſurely an <hi>Ordination to death,</hi> yet every ordination to death doth not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
<hi>Reprobation;</hi> For Ordination to life and Predeſtination,
and Ordination to death and Reprobation, differ as much as
<hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species,</hi> as a Reaſonable Creature doth differ from a Senſitive Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
But to let this paſs; This place of <hi>St. Iude</hi> is, in the opinion of many
<pb n="3167" facs="tcp:100044:101"/>
good Writers, Equivalent to that of <hi>St. Peter.</hi> 1. Ep. 2. Cap. 8. ver. <hi>They
ſtumble at the word being diſobedient, whereunto alſo they were Appointed.</hi> But
for that place,<note place="margin">I ſuppoſe he means <hi>Mr. By<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> who is far from the Rigidneſs of ſome in that point.</note> it is ingenuouſly and diſcreetly expounded by a late Engliſh
Writer in his Comments upon that Epiſtle And it were to be wiſhed, that his
Expoſition were ſincerely imbraced, by ſuch as had the man in eſteem while
he lived, and are much beholding to his writings (eſpecially upon this Epiſtle)
ſince he dyed. I ſhall only now give you notice that <hi>the Originall word</hi> in
this place of S. Jude, rendred by <hi>ordained,</hi> is not the ſame with <hi>that</hi> in <hi>St. Peter;
That</hi> is <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and is well rendred <hi>Appointed.</hi> Nor is it the ſame with that
of <hi>St. Paul,</hi> Act. 13. 48. <hi>As many as were ordained (<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>,) unto eternal
Life, believed.</hi> S. Judes word here is <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is, as ſome render it,
<hi>Praeſcripti,</hi> preſcribed; Of whom it was forewritten to this condemnation.
But as <hi>Beza, deſcripti;</hi> that is, as men deſigned, taxed, or <hi>proſcribed</hi> to this
condemnation. It includes then an <hi>Ordinance</hi> or ſomewhat more, to witt
an <hi>Ordinance upon Record:</hi> but in what Record? In Gods everlaſting <hi>Book
of death?</hi> or may we ſay that he hath <hi>ſuch a Book?</hi> It is evident that there be
<hi>more Books</hi> then One, out of which men ſhall be Judged at the laſt day, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their works,<note place="margin">The 2. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſubdivided.</note> as <hi>St. Iohn</hi> tells us, Rev. 20. 12.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Points</hi> then Remaining to be diſcuſſed are <hi>Two. Firſt,</hi> In what Senſe
theſe men are ſaid to be <hi>fore-ordained to everlaſting death,</hi> or in what Senſe
men are ſaid to be <hi>Reprobated</hi> from everlaſting, or <hi>from Eternity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second,</hi> Whether our Apoſtle in this place did expreſly and punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
mean <hi>Gods eternal Decree of reprobation,</hi> or ſome other ordination to death?</p>
                  <p>6. In handling the firſt Point, I ſhall only explicate that which I haue elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
delivered,<note place="margin">See the 37. Chap.</note> to wit, <hi>That albeit, whoſoever is reprobated, is reprobated from e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity;
yet no man at the time of his Baptiſm is a Reprobate;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Numb. 16. and Pharaohs hardning.</note> 
                     <hi>few or none are born in that
estate or condition; but ſuch as finally periſh do fall into it.</hi> The Caſe may be made
clear by divers Inſtances, wherein men, even by humane Lawes, may be
ſentenced to death or other puniſhment <hi>before they be born,</hi> and yet at the
time of their birth, or within ſome few days before their death or puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
be no more lyable to the Sentence of the Law, then other men are.
For unto <hi>death,</hi> or other grievous puniſhment there is required, for the
moſt part, as well the <hi>Sentence of the Judge,</hi> as the Sentence of the Rule or
Law. And yet in ſome peculiar Caſes, no more is required then the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the <hi>Law</hi> or Rule,<note place="margin">Sententia Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicis, &amp; Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia Juris.</note> which was made and given many hundreds of
years before the Party was born, which is ſentenced by it. Every one that
committeth murther is lyable to death by the <hi>Law;</hi> But beſides the Sentence
of the Law, or the Rule, which is Generall to all, there is required the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
of the <hi>Judge</hi> to apply the Law to this Particular; and before he give
ſentence, there is further required a <hi>Formal Proceſſe,</hi> not only for proof of
the <hi>Fact</hi> it ſelf, but of the <hi>Quality</hi> of it. And, untill this Proceſſe be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
the Judge himſelf may not give Sentence although he himſelf ſaw the
the Fact committed. Nor may the Party be executed or put to death by
any, untill the Judge have given Sentence. He is condemnable before the
Jurie paſſe upon him, but not condemned when the Jury finds him guilty,
untill the Judge paſſe ſentence upon him. But if a private man ſhall take up
Arms againſt his Soveraign Lord, or the ſtate wherein he lives, he is rebellious
<hi>Ipſo Iure,</hi> he is a Rebell by <hi>Law,</hi> there needs no other Tryall or Formal Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe,
beſides the Evidence of the <hi>Fact.</hi> The <hi>Martial</hi> or <hi>General</hi> is only to
put the Law in Execution, and the Party thus rebelling is ſentenced to death
by the Law, which was in force many hundreds of years before the party
offending was born, who not withſtanding is not lyable to this Sentence of
<pb n="3168" facs="tcp:100044:102"/>
death till he commit the <hi>Fact,</hi> at <hi>which</hi> the Law doth immediately ſtrike, not
at his <hi>Perſon.</hi> Again, there is ordinarily required to <hi>Excommunication,</hi> not
only <hi>Sententia Iuris,</hi> but <hi>Sententia Iudicis;</hi> Though the <hi>Canon,</hi> by which he
is Excommunicated, were made Long before, yet he that offends againſt the
<hi>Canon,</hi> is not forthwith Excommunicated by it, until he be refractory or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumacious.
The Judge may <hi>admoniſh</hi> before he give Sentence, &amp; without his
ſentence <hi>judicially</hi> given the party is not exco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>municated by the <hi>Law.</hi> But ſome
peculiar Caſes there be, wherein a man may ſtand <hi>Immediatly Excommunicated</hi>
by the law or <hi>Canon,</hi> without the ſentence of the Judg: there is no place left for
Admonition or recanting. The Fact being once proved, either by wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes
or by its own Evidence, the Judge hath no more to do, but to read the
<hi>Canon,</hi> and to pronounce that <hi>the party hath fallen upon it.</hi> So that he is ſaid to
be excommunicated by the Law or <hi>Canon,</hi> which was made perhaps a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years before he was born, &amp; yet not born an excommunicate perſon, or in
the State of excommunication; into this eſtate he falls by doing ſome Fact
or other, at which the Rule or <hi>Canon</hi> doth immediately ſtrike, without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Proceſſe or Conviction. Now in as much as the Sentence was
given before he was born, it cannot be denyed but that he was excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<hi>before he was born,</hi> and yet had not been excommunicated at all, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe
he had done that Fact which requireth <hi>Excommunication by the Law.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. Some Founders of Colledges appoint a Proceſs or Formal proceeding
againſt Offenders, even in groſſer Crimes; as for <hi>Adultery, Murther, manifest</hi>
Perjury, or the like, before any man can be expelled for theſe and the like
Crimes. Such as they appoint Judges muſt give Sentence <hi>Viva voce,</hi> upon the
examination, not of the <hi>Fact</hi> only, but of the <hi>Quality</hi> of the Fact; as whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be <hi>Scandalous</hi> in ſo high a degree, as deſerves <hi>Amotion</hi> without fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Admonition</hi> or expectation of amendment. And every one that is in
theſe Caſes amoved or expelled, is expelled by his <hi>preſent Judges,</hi> not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly
by his <hi>Founder</hi> or his Statutes; though the Judges muſt proceed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to their intent or meaning. But in caſe any of the ſame ſociety, the
very <hi>Governours</hi> themſelves ſhould obtain a Licence or Diſpenſation for their
Oath there needs no ſentence of any Judge, there is no place for Admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
or Traverſe: becauſe the <hi>Founders</hi> themſelves, even when they made
theſe Lawes and ſtatutes, inflicted theſe puniſhments upon all ſuch as in this
kind tranſgreſs their ſtatutes. Now upon whomſoever the <hi>Founder</hi> of any
Society, which dyed ſome two or three hundred years agoe did inflict the
puniſhment of Expulſion by vertue of this preſent Statute, he did inflict it
before the party offending was born: and yet this puniſhment had not at
all fallen upon him, unleſs he had committed that Fact, which the Founder
in his life time did thus ſeverely cenſure, whenſoever it ſhould by any of his
Society be committed.<note place="margin">See the Note at the end of this Chapter.</note> Now in this caſe we may truly ſay, that the party
thus offending doth * <hi>expell himſelf</hi> by committing that Fact, for which he was
expelled by his <hi>Founder.</hi> The Founder then expels him before he was born,
without any reſpect unto his <hi>Perſon;</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>or no Lawgiver makes any Decree or
Law againſt any mans <hi>Perſon,</hi> but againſt mens <hi>Miſdemeanours;</hi> but the party
cannot be ſaid to expell himſelf before he doth daſh againſt the inflexible
Law or ſtatute.</p>
                  <p>8. And if no <hi>Law-giver</hi> on earth, how partial ſoever, make any Capital
Decrees againſt any mans perſon; Far be it from us to think, that the <hi>Eternall
Law-giver,</hi> who is himſelf the Everliving Rule of <hi>Juſtice</hi> and Equity, ſhould
ſentence any mans <hi>Perſon</hi> to everlaſting death; albeit whoſoever is ſentenced
to everlaſting death, be ſo ſentenced from <hi>Eternity,</hi> becauſe God himſelf,
<pb n="3169" facs="tcp:100044:102"/>
who is <hi>Eternal,</hi> is the very Rule or Law, a <hi>Law or Rule inflexible,</hi> which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
alter, and yet rewards every man according to all his wayes and works;
not according to his <hi>Perſon</hi> or <hi>Individual</hi> Nature. Whoſoever then is <hi>reprobated</hi>
by God, is <hi>Reprobated</hi> by him before he be born, even from <hi>Eternity;</hi> and yet no
man Baptized is born a Reprobate, or becomes ſo untill he reprobate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
by committing thoſe ſins, or rather that meaſure of ſin, unto which the
<hi>Eternall Law-giver</hi> did, before all Times, award finall excluſion from the
Benefits of Chriſts Death and Paſſion. Now unto ſuch <hi>ungodly men,</hi> as <hi>St.
Iude</hi> here ſpeaks of, this Award was allotted from <hi>Eternity,</hi> &amp; thus they were
<hi>ordained to Condemnation:</hi> But their <hi>Perſons</hi> were not created or made to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlineſſe.
Taking them as now they are, there was a Neceſſity from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity</hi>
that they ſhould <hi>periſh;</hi> but there was <hi>No neceſsity</hi> from eternity that
they ſhould be ſuch <hi>ungodly men</hi> as now they are. This neceſſity did accrue
in time, they wilfully and freely brought it upon themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Thus much of the <hi>Firſt Part</hi> of the <hi>Second General,</hi> to wit, In what <hi>ſenſe</hi> it
is true, <hi>That whoſoever is reprobated, or ordained to everlaſting death in time,
was ſo reprobated or ordained from Eternity.</hi> The meaning is, that the <hi>Law,</hi> or
Rule, by which he is reprobated, or ordained to death, hath no beginning
of Date, it was unchangably ſet from <hi>Eternity.</hi> Yet was this <hi>Law</hi> or rule an
<hi>Immanent Act,</hi> that is, conteined in him only who is <hi>Eternal;</hi> it dit did not produce
any Reall effect anſwerable unto it, either <hi>for</hi> the creature before he was
made, or <hi>in</hi> the creature after he was made, until he have made up that <hi>meaſure
of Sin,</hi> unto which everlaſting death was by this Eternal living Rule award<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
But the meaſure of ſinne being made up, then (as the Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers
ſpeak) <hi>Indicium tranſit in rem judicatam,</hi> that is, the eternall Law or
ſentence produceth a Tranſient Effect in the Creature ſo qualified, and that
is an <hi>Ordination Paſſive,</hi> the beginning of that death which ſhall have no end.</p>
                  <p>9. The <hi>Second Part</hi> of the <hi>Second General,</hi>

Both do fully witneſs that he ſpeakes only of ſome Fore-ordination made

from the Time of their <hi>following the ways of Cain,</hi> of <hi>Balaam</hi> and <hi>Corah.</hi>
God did not ordain either from <hi>Eternity,</hi> or by any written Sentence
upon Record, That theſe men, by name, ſhould go on in the <hi>ways of Cain,</hi>
ſhould run after <hi>the error of Balaam,</hi> ſhould <hi>periſh in the gainſaying of Corah.</hi>

But now that they had viſibly followed the wayes of theſe wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                     </gap> Fore-ſentenced, or Fore-ordained to
the ſame condemnation which had fallen upon <hi>Cain, Balaam,</hi> and <hi>Corah.</hi> The
Sentence or Judgment declared of old againſt theſe Three, was as a <hi>Ruled
Caſe</hi> for the condemnation of theſe men that S. Jude ſpeaks of; they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred
the Sentence of condemnation given of old, as we ſay; <hi>Ipſo Facto:</hi>
that is, by doing the ſame things which <hi>Cain, Balaam,</hi> and <hi>Corah</hi> had done.
And <hi>S. Jude,</hi> whether by the Spirit of Revelation, or by Evidence of their
Facts themſelves, doth but declare or pronounce that theſe ungodly men
had fallen fowl upon that immovable Rule or <hi>Canon,</hi> which had formerly
been declared againſt <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Corah</hi> and his Confederates.</p>
                  <p>10. That theſe men now were in the ſame ſtate, wherein <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Corah</hi>
were after they had committed theſe Foul ſins for which they were condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned,
our Apoſtle takes it as granted, ver. 12, 13. <hi>Theſe are ſpots in your feaſts
of Charity when they feaſt with you, feeding themſelves without fear: clouds they
are without water, caried about with winds, trees whoſe fruit withereth, without
fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots; Raging waves of the Sea, foming out
their own ſhame, wandring ſtars, to whom is reſerved the Blackneſs of darkneſs for
ever.</hi> He ſpeakes of them as of Reprobates or men ordained to condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
For being in the ſame ſtate or condition, for the Quality and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of their ſins, that <hi>Cain, Balaam,</hi> and <hi>Corah</hi> had been, they were <hi>Fore-Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained</hi>
with them to the ſame condemnation; and this their <hi>Fore-Ordination</hi>
was upon Record in all that <hi>Moſes</hi> or others had written concerning Gods
Judgments upon <hi>Cain,</hi> upon <hi>Balaam</hi> or <hi>Corah.</hi> That our Apoſtle means
ſuch a <hi>Fore-Ordination</hi> upon Ancient Record we gather from the 14. verſe.
<hi>And Enoch alſo the ſeventh from Adam prophecied of theſe, ſaying; Behold the
Lord cometh, &amp;c.</hi> If <hi>Enoch ALSO</hi> did <hi>prophecy</hi> of them, then <hi>ſome other</hi>
beſides <hi>Enoch</hi> had prophecied of them. So had <hi>Moſes,</hi> who related Gods
Judgments upon <hi>Cain,</hi> prophecied of their Judgments, who followed the
<hi>wayes of Cain;</hi> and in foretelling Gods fearfull Judgments upon <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi>
and <hi>Abiram,</hi> he foretold the condemnation of all ſuch as followed their ways,
and were <hi>Fore-Ordained</hi> to the like condemnation in their condemnation;
But more expreſly <hi>Fore-Ordained</hi> of old unto the ſame condemnation by <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nochs</hi>
Prophecie, which was more ancient then <hi>Moſes</hi> his writings, although
<hi>Moſes</hi> mentioned it not. The form of his Prophecy, or of his Judgments
denounced againſt all ungodly men,<note place="margin">The Book of Enoch. Of it, See Tertul. De Cultu Foem. Lib. 1. Cap. 3. and the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. upon that place.</note> was upon Record in our Apoſtles time
in a Book, called <hi>the Book of Enoch,</hi> unto which, or ſo much of which as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns
this place, <hi>St. Jude gives</hi> Authentick teſtimony ver. 14. &amp;c. <hi>Behold the
Lord-cometh with ten thouſand of his Saints, To execute judgement upon all, and
to convince all that are ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds, which they
have ungodly committed, and of all their hard ſpeeches, which ungodly ſinners have
ſpoken againſt him.</hi> This Prophecy was literally meant and in particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
againſt the ungracious ſeed of <hi>Cain,</hi> and other ſuch ungodly men of
the Old World, as did oppoſe or malign the Church of God, then ſeated in
the Poſterity of <hi>Seth:</hi> of which <hi>Enoch</hi> was a principal member, a man of
high place or dignity; but the ſame Prophecy was literally meant of theſe
ungodly men, which did oppoſe the Church and deny that Lord, which <hi>Enoch</hi>
foretold ſhould come to <hi>give judgement upon all ſuch, as continue in ungodlineſs.</hi>
And though this Prophecy were verified, or in ſome meaſure fulfilled in the
ungodly men of the Old World; yet was it more exactly fulfilled in theſe
ungodly men here in <hi>St. Iude,</hi> and ſhall be fulfilled again upon all ſuch as they
were, unto the worlds end; and all, in whom it is, or hath been, or ſhall be
<pb n="3171" facs="tcp:100044:103"/>
fulfilled, are by it <hi>Ordained</hi> to the Condemnation here meant; and <hi>St. Iude</hi>
having perfect notice that theſe ungodly men had followed the wayes of
<hi>Cain,</hi> and of <hi>Corah,</hi> doth but pronounce or declare them to be lyable to the
Condemnation foretold by <hi>Enoch.</hi> But whether all of them were at this
time in the abſolute State of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> that is, irreverſibly ordained to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
death; or whether the Gate of Mercy, and Way to Repentance,
were everlaſtingly ſhut up againſt all of them, That we leave to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall

the Jewiſh Church before <hi>St. Iude</hi> wrote this Epiſtle, that their <hi>GREAT
AND FEARFVL EXCOMMVNICATION</hi> was conceived in the very
Form of Words, which <hi>S. Iude</hi> here, out of Enochs, uſeth. And as <hi>Writts</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt

in them, as ſome are called <hi>Sub Poena,</hi> ſome <hi>Niſi prius</hi> &amp;c. ſo the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
and moſt fearfull Excommunication, which the Jewiſh Church did uſe,
was called <hi>THE EXCOMMVNICATION OF DOMINVS VENIET. THE
LORD SHALL COME. St. Paul,</hi> as we read, Rom. 9. 3. <hi>did wiſh</hi> that he
himſelf might be, <hi>Anathema,</hi> one excommunicated or ſeparated from Chriſt
<hi>for his</hi> Countrey-men, or <hi>kinſmen according to the fleſh.</hi> But he did not wiſh
himſelf to be <hi>Anathema Maranatha</hi> for their ſakes. This kind of <hi>Anathema</hi>
or Excommunication, though he conſidently denounceth againſt all ſuch in
the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> as did <hi>not love</hi> their Saviour. <hi>If any man,</hi> ſaith he,
1 Cor. 16. 22. <hi>love not the Lord Ièſus Chriſt, let him be Anathema Maranatha;</hi>
that is, all one, as if he had ſaid; <q>Let that Sentence, which <hi>Enoch</hi> firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
againſt all vngodly and wicked men, eſpecially againſt all Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemers
of God, of Chriſt, or the wayes of the truth, fall upon him who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever
he be, that after ſo many miracles wrought in Chriſts name, and ſo
great manifeſtation of the truth revealed in his Goſpel, <hi>doth not love the Lord,</hi>
which hath redeemed him.</q> So then all in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> that did
not at this time <hi>love Chriſt,</hi> were excommunicated, or <hi>ordained of old</hi> to that
condemnation by the ſentence, which <hi>Enoch</hi> had given in Generall: and <hi>S. Paul</hi>
only declares them <hi>Incidiſſe in Canonem,</hi> to have fallen under that Fearfull
Sentence of Condemnation. Thus farre of the <hi>Two Doctrinal</hi> Points pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
as firſt, <hi>What condemnation it is where unto theſe men were ordained.</hi> Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,
<hi>In what manner they were ordained of old.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>12 Now for Application, let us inquire what Speciall ſins they were, by
which they fell under this Sentence firſt denounced by <hi>Enoch</hi> againſt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly
men of his time;<note place="margin">The Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> or denounced by God himſelf againſt <hi>Cain,</hi> or by
his ſervant <hi>Moſes</hi> againſt <hi>Corah.</hi> One Principal Sin was, to <hi>Deſpiſe Dominion,
and ſpeak evil of Dignities;</hi> that is, of men in high place or Authority whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
in Church or Commonwealth, ver. 8. And this ſin he aggravates from the
contrary behaviour of <hi>Michael the Archangel,</hi> even towords the <hi>Divel</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
who had no dignity or dominion but uſurped, ver. 9. <hi>But theſe men
ſpeak evil of thoſe things, which they know not: and what they know naturally as
bruit beaſts, in thoſe things they corrupt themſelves.</hi> Now as we know the form
<hi>or figure</hi> of the ſeal, which we ſee not, by the impreſſion or ſtamp which it
leaves in the wax or paper: So ſome men there be in our time, who expreſs
that Character, which <hi>St. Iude</hi> hath put upon theſe ungodly men, as fully in
their dayly talk and converſation, as if <hi>St. Iude</hi> had fitted it for them, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
them by name. Such there are, that bring railing accuſations againſt
their Betters, againſt all of what rank or place ſoever in the Church, which
<pb n="3172" facs="tcp:100044:104"/>
diſſent from them in Opinions concerning <hi>Election or Reprobation,</hi> or the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of Gods Decree, being points, which they underſtand not; and yet
ſpeak evill of them that ſeek to rectify their Errour. But in things which
are plain and eaſy to be underſtood, which the very heathen knevv by light
of nature; as in points of <hi>Obedience to their lawful Prince,</hi> or to ſuch as are in
Authority under him, in theſe (ſhall I ſay as our Apoſtle ſayes?) <hi>like bruit
beaſts they corrupt themſelves:</hi> Sure I am they are more bruitiſhly ignorant,
then the ancient heathen <hi>Romanes,</hi> or then the Modern <hi>Turks,</hi> or moſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
<hi>Infidels</hi> are. Another ſpeciall branch of theſe mens ungodlineſs was
the <hi>Turning the Grace of God into wantonneſs:</hi> and what do they elſe, that
trouble themſelves and their neighbours with intricate diſputes, how the
<hi>Grace of God doth co-operate</hi> with man in his Converſion or Regeneration; &amp; yet
in the mean time violate the bond of peace and charity by their uncivill rude
behaviour, and ſcurrilous manner of ſpeech and writing. But it is no mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell
if they ſow diſcord amongſt Chriſtian men, who bend the ſtrength of
their wits and pens to (nurſe or) <hi>Courſe</hi> a Faction betwixt Gods <hi>Grace</hi> to his
<hi>Elect,</hi> and his <hi>Goodneſs</hi> towards <hi>All;</hi> eſpecially to whom he vouchſafeth the
Uſe of his Sacraments. Now to deny Gods infinite <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> or to cut the
wings of his mercy, ſo ſhort as ſome men do, is to <hi>deny the Lord God,</hi> and
that in a worſe manner (for matter of Opinion) then theſe men here in
<hi>St. Jude</hi> can be convinced to have done.<note place="margin">How ſome deny Chriſt.</note> But do they likewiſe deny the Lord
Chriſt? Surely they deny him to be the <hi>Lord Redeemer of Mankind, by deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that he payed the Ranſome for ALL;</hi> eſpecially for <hi>ALL</hi> that are <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized</hi>
in his Name. For if Chriſt did not pay the Ranſome for <hi>ALL that are
baptized</hi> in his Name, Then is he not their Lord by right of <hi>Redemption,</hi> as
well, as by right of <hi>Creation:</hi> that is, then he is no otherwiſe Lord of them,
then he is of Divels; for even of them he is Lord by right of <hi>Creation;</hi> and if
Chriſt be no otherwiſe Lord of ſuch as are baptized in his name then he is
of Divels, then we are falſe witneſſes of Chriſt, when we teach ſuch as are
baptized, ſuch as ſhall be admitted unto Baptiſm to <hi>believe</hi> in Chriſt as their
<hi>Redeemer.</hi> Again, were it true that Chriſt did dye for the <hi>Elect only,</hi> then no
man could be more ſure that Chriſt did pay the Ranſome for his ſins, and
that he hath purchaſed the remiſſion of his ſins, then he is, that he is in the
number of the <hi>Elect.</hi> Now no man is bound to believe, no man may ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believe at his <hi>First Admiſſion</hi> into the Church, that, he is in the number of
the <hi>Elect;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See the 3. note at the end of this Chapt.</note> that is, in the number of ſuch as ſhall not <hi>Finally Periſh.</hi> If then we
ſhould teach men or children, that Chriſt dyed <hi>only</hi> for the <hi>Elect,</hi> we ſhall
leave no poſſible <hi>Mean</hi> between Infidelity and Preſumption; for if we teach
them that Chriſt died <hi>only</hi> for the <hi>Elect,</hi> they muſt remain in the eſtate of
Infidels and Unbelievers, untill they believe that they are of the number of
the <hi>Elect.</hi> And if we teach them to begin their Belief in Chriſt at this Point,
That they are of the number of the <hi>Elect,</hi> then both they and we fall into the
very dregs of their Hereſy, whom <hi>St. Jude</hi> here ſaith were <hi>fore-ordained to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</hi>
This was the very Root of their ungodlineſs. And for this
reaſon <hi>St. Iude</hi> in the very next verſe unto the Text puts the Church (to
whom he wrote this Epiſtle) in remembrance, of that which had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
delivered unto them; to wit, that albeit God had delivered All the
People out of <hi>Egypt;</hi> yet after wards he deſtroyed ſuch as <hi>believed not,</hi> that
is, ſuch as continued not in their Firſt Belief. This then was the Summe of
the <hi>Faith Once delivered unto the Saints;</hi> that they were all delivered by
Chriſts death, from the ſlavery of <hi>Satan,</hi> and that this deliverance was as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
ſealed unto them by the bloud of Chriſt, as the deliverance of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
                     <pb n="3173" facs="tcp:100044:104"/>
out of <hi>Egypt</hi> was by the bloud of the <hi>Paſchal Lamb.</hi> Yet for all this they muſt
not preſume, that they could not or ſhould not finally periſh, ſeeing <hi>God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed
many in the wilderneſs, which he had delivered out of Egypt.</hi> Our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle
then, if we will follow his directions, puts us into the <hi>Middle</hi> or ſafe
<hi>Way</hi> between the contrary extreams of <hi>Reprobation</hi> and <hi>Election,</hi> and the
Mean or <hi>Middle Way</hi> is, That <hi>A Great Part of men, which have been Baptized,
are neither in the one State nor in the other:</hi> But, as hath been before declared in

ſo the Holy Ghoſt doth ſanctifie them and all the <hi>Elect People</hi> of God.] But who can think,
that our Church meant to teach Children, at the firſt Profeſſion of their Faith, to believe, they
were <hi>Elect,</hi> that is, <hi>ſuch as cannot finally periſh?</hi> This was to teach them their Faith
backwards, to ſeek heaven by deſcending from it. S. Paul; nay, The Angels that have kept
their first Eſtate almoſt 6000. years could not reach higher. Yet would our Church have e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
one, at his firſt Profeſſion of Faith, believe, that he is <hi>One of the Elect people of God.</hi>
Thoſe RR. Fathers that compoſed that Catechiſm, and our H. mother that did Authorize it, did
in charitie preſume, that every one which would take upon him to expound that Catechiſm, or
other Principles of Faith, ſhould firſt know the <hi>Diſtinction</hi> between <hi>Elect,</hi> that is, ſuch as
cannot periſh, and the <hi>Elect people of God:</hi> or, between <hi>Election</hi> unto Gods ordinary <hi>Grace</hi>
or means of Salvation, <hi>and Election unto Glory.</hi> Every Nation or Company of men when
firſt Converted from Gentiliſm to Chriſtianity, became an <hi>Elect people,</hi> a choſen Generation;
that is, they and their ſeed were made capable of Baptiſm, reciev'd an Intereſt in Gods Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
&amp;c. which Heathens whileſt Heathens could not have. All of us are in Baptiſm thus
far ſanctifyed, that we are made true Members of the <hi>viſible Church,</hi> qualifyed for hearing

Hereſie; <hi>That there is a Goodneſſe Objective, In the Creature, which in Order
of Nature is precedent to the Act or exerciſe of Gods Will;</hi> thus, by neceſſary

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Propoſition which he chargeth with moſt <hi>Blaſphemous

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the ſame Propoſition hath been uttered, or maintained by
me.</p>
                  <p>That <hi>Arminius,</hi> or any <hi>Arminian,</hi> did ever in writing, or otherwiſe, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
or mantain that Propoſition which this Objector hath cenſured for a moſt
<hi>Blaſphemous Arminian Hereſie,</hi> is more then I know, more then I can ſuſpect,
and more (I think) then the Author of this Accuſation can prove; unleſſe
his meaning be, that any abſurd or Blaſphemous Opinion, may juſtly be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered
upon <hi>Arminius,</hi> or aſcribed unto the <hi>Arminians.</hi> And if this be his
meaning he will prove him ſelf to be a more Groſs Arminian Heretick, then
thoſe whom he only ſuſpects, (but proves nothing) of moſt <hi>Blaſphemous Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minian
Hereſie.</hi> For I never heard or read that Propoſition which he char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth

the Author of the forementioned <hi>Epiſtle to the Royal Joſhua, and Loyal El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. <q>This <hi>Propoſition</hi> following, I acknowledge to be mine, and have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouched
it in <hi>A Treatiſe of the Divine Eſſence and Attributes,</hi> Cap. 13. Par. 3.
Pag. in quarto 149. <hi>As there is a Logical Poſſibility preſuppoſed to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the Almighty Power: ſo there is a Goodneſſe Objective precedent in order
of Nature to the Act or exerciſe of his Will.</hi>
                     </q> That either this <hi>Logical Poſsibility</hi>
which is preſuppoſed to the working of the <hi>Almighty Power,</hi> or the <hi>Objective
Goodneſs</hi> which is <hi>precedent in order of Nature to the Act or exerciſe of Gods Will</hi>
ſhould be <hi>IN THE CREATVRE,</hi> I never writ, I never ſaid, I never was
ſo uncharitable as to think, that any man in his right wits had ever ſaid or
writ it, untill I read it in the forecited Epiſtle, without any Diſtinction of
Letter, Point, or Parentheſis, to notifie whether theſe words <hi>IN THE CREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TVRE]</hi>
were conteined in my Propoſition, or inſerted by the Author of
that Epiſtle, out of ſome Probable Collections from Words, or Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
precedent, that my meaning was as he doth make it, though my
words were not ſo as he relates them.</p>
                  <p>5. That the Author of this Epiſtle might conceive ſuch a Propoſition,
Charity may attribute it to his Ignorance in matters handled in that Chapter,
wherein my former Propoſition is contained. But why he ſhould inſert theſe
words <hi>[In the Creature]</hi> into the Propoſition by me delivered, Chriſtian
charitie it ſelf, which is not ſuſpitious, which <hi>Believeth all things,</hi> that may
without imputation of folly be believed, cannot attribute it to his Ignorance,
<pb n="3177" facs="tcp:100044:106"/>
but to his Paſſion, or to his too much credulitie unto others, who ſuggeſted the
former Propoſition unto him, as worthie of a Parliamentarie Cenſure, or to
his zeal to have me cenſured as one of the <hi>Achans that trouble Iſrael</hi> But what
he can ſay for himſelf in excuſe of this palpable Falſification of my words, <hi>I</hi>
leave to them who have juſt cauſe and full Authoritie, to examine him. That
there could be any <hi>Goodneſs in the Creature,</hi> before the Creature was, or had
actual being, no man did ever avouch. That any creature could poſſily have
Actual Being, or Goodneſs Actual, or exiſtent in it, without ſome Precedent
Act of <hi>Gods Will,</hi> I had expreſly denyed in the Propoſition immediatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
to the Propoſition which the Author of the Epiſtle hath falſified, by
inſerting theſe words <hi>[In the Creature.]</hi> He might by the like Omiſſion of
the Propoſition precedent, (without any interſertion or falſification) have
proved this Propoſition to be <hi>Davids, [There is no God.]</hi> For this Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
is expreſly ſet down by <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 14. 1. <hi>Non eſt Deus.</hi> And this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
would well pleaſe an Epicure or Atheiſt, if he took not the words
precedent into conſideration with it. <hi>[Dixit inſipiens in corde ſuo, non eſt
Deus.]</hi> The Fool hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God. And when I
ſhall avouch the Propoſition wherewith he chargeth me, otherwiſe then
with this addition <hi>[An ignorant or unwiſe man hath ſaid it, or laid it to my
charge.]</hi> Let me be cenſured for a Fool; for a Blaſphemer, or what you
will.</p>
                  <p>6. The Propoſition delivered by me is ſo clear, that no Artiſt, if he be
a Chriſtian, can deny it. The Propoſition conſiſts of theſe <hi>Two Parts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> There is a Logical Poſsibility preſuppoſed to the working of the Almighty
Power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> There is an Objective Goodneſs precedent in order of nature to the Act
or exerciſe of Gods Will.</p>
                  <p>Againſt the firſt part, I do not hear of any exception made or taken: yet
to make it plainer unto thoſe, who are not willing to except againſt it, I will
explicate the meaning of it in a particular Inſtance.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt Man was made of the earth, by the working of the Almightie
power: and the earth whereof he was made was by the ſame power made
of nothing. Both were made by the working of the Almighty Power,
within the compaſſe of theſe 6000. years Current. But before Time had
any Being, even from Eternity, there was a <hi>Logical Poſſibility,</hi> That the Earth
might be made of Nothing; and that Man might be made of the Earth. He
unto whom nothing is impoſſible, He unto whom <hi>all things are poſsible,</hi> did
know the making of both to be <hi>Logically Poſſible</hi> (that is, to imply no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction)
before he made them; much better then we know that they
were made by him. For this we know, and muſt believe, that the Almighty
Power worketh nothing maketh nothing without Fore-knowledge, not only
of it, as <hi>Poſſible;</hi> but as <hi>Future.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Not the Creation of <hi>Man</hi> only, but the Creation of <hi>Man after Gods own
Image</hi> was <hi>Logically poſſible</hi> (that is, it did implie no Contradiction) from
Eternitie. The Poſſible Creation of Man after this manner, was the Object
of Gods Power, before he ſaid, <hi>Let us make Man after our own Image and ſimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</hi>
This was the Act or Exerciſe of Gods Power or Will. For the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
whereby he is able to do all things, never worketh without ſome Act or
exerciſe of his Will. For as the Apoſtle ſaith, Epheſ. 1. 11. <hi>He worketh all
things after the counſel of his own will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Second part of the Propoſition was <hi>[There is a Goodneſs Objective pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
in order of nature to the Act or exerciſe of Gods Will.]</hi> For further declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="3178" facs="tcp:100044:107"/>
of This Truth, I added <hi>This Propoſition.</hi> Unto ſome things conſidered as
<hi>Logically poſſible,</hi> this <hi>Goodneſs Objective</hi> is ſo eſſentially annexed, that if it be
his Will to give them actuall Being, they muſt of neceſſity be <hi>Actually Good;</hi>
nor can he that can do all things, will their contraries. For example, The
Creation of man after <hi>Gods own Image</hi> was Logically poſſible from eternity,
and was the Object of <hi>Gods Power,</hi> of his knowledge, and Will, before man
was thus created. Now unto this poſſibility of mans Creation after Gods
Image (which was objectively in Gods knowledg from eternity) there was
a <hi>Goodneſs</hi> alſo Objective, ſo eſſentially annexed, that whenſoever God ſhould
be pleaſed to make man after this Pattern he was of neceſſity to be <hi>actually
Good.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7. Not to conceal any part of my meaning in this 13. Chapter. Unto the
former Propoſition [The creation of man after Gods image was <hi>Logically
Poſſible</hi> before the Act or exerciſe of Gods Will, before the working of his
Almighty power, by whoſe concurrence man was upon the ſixt day crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.]
I will adde theſe Propoſitions following.</p>
                  <p>1. To create Man after Gods own Image, and not to create him good,
was never <hi>Logically Poſſible;</hi> it could be no Object either of Gods Almighty
Power or Will. This Propoſition had no Objective Truth in his Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge,
whoſe Knowledge is Infinite, whoſe Power is Omnipotent,
whoſe Will is Irreſiſtible.</p>
                  <p>2. The Act or exerciſe of Gods Omnipotent Will was the true Cauſe, the
only cauſe, why man was created after his Image. But, that man being
created after his Image, ſhould be good, the Act or exerciſe of Gods Will
or Omnipotent Power were not the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>3. The connexion between the Image of God, and that goodneſs which
was in Man created after his image, (albeit we conſider this connexion as
poſſibly future from Eternity) was eſſential and eternal, and was the Object
of Gods eternal Preſcience or foreknowledge, which in order of nature is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent
to the Acts or exerciſes of Gods Will.</p>
                  <p>4. Gods Will, or the Act or exerciſe of Gods Will, is the Cauſe why man
was made, why being made Good he was tyed to the obſervance of Gods mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Law; not the Cauſe why mans Obſervance of the Moral Law was or is
in its nature good.</p>
                  <p>5. The end of the Moral Lavv, or of Precepts Evangelical, is to frame us
to a conformity vvith our heavenly Fathers Nature; to be <hi>holy as he is Holy.</hi>
Gods Will declared in the Moral Lavv, and vvorking in us both the Will and
the Deed to obſerve it, is the Cauſe by vvhich vve are made conformable to
the Divine Nature: but Gods Will declared in that Lavv enacted, is not the
Cauſe vvhy our conformity to the Divine Nature is good; He rather vvills us
to be conformable to his Nature, to his Will; That is, to be <hi>holy, as He is
Holy,</hi> becauſe ſuch conformity vvas eſſentially, and eternally good. All
Goodneſs in the creature, vvhether actually exiſtent, or conſidered as poſſib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
future, is unſeparable from this conformity, or conſonancy to infinite and
eternal goodneſs, vvhich is the infallible Rule of all created goodneſs, the
eternal Rule, from vvhich the acts or exerciſes of Gods Will, either in
making, in preſerving, or governing the creature, take their validity. <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
Being,</hi> or Logical Poſſibility of Being, is oppoſed to <hi>Actual Being,</hi> or
exiſtence; <hi>Goodneſs Objective</hi> is oppoſed to <hi>Goodneſs Subjective,</hi> that
is, to goodneſſe actually inherent, or exiſtent in any ſubſtance. In the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
and Infinite Eſſence, nothing is or can be <hi>Subjectively,</hi> all things are
in him <hi>Objectively,</hi> and were ſo in him before they had Actual Being.
<pb n="3179" facs="tcp:100044:107"/>
And if all things had an <hi>Objective Being</hi> in him before they were, then the
<hi>Goodneſs</hi> of every creature which is good, had an <hi>Objective being</hi> in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
it could have any <hi>Subjective being</hi> in the creature. The Beautie of <hi>Salo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi>
Temple, whilſt it ſtood, was <hi>Subjectively</hi> in the materials rightly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
and adorned, but <hi>Objectively</hi> in the Spectators or Surveyors eye.
The ſame Beautie was <hi>Objectively</hi> in the Architects Brain or Fancie, before it
could be either <hi>Subjectively</hi> in the material Temple or building, or <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively</hi>
in the Spectators eye. In like manner, Juſtice, or goodneſſe Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
was <hi>Subjectively</hi> in the firſt Man after his Creation, but was <hi>Objectively</hi> in
God before the Firſt Man was created.</p>
                  <p>8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet if another man had written, That there was an <hi>Objective Goodneſſe
in the Creature precedent to the Act or exerciſe of Gods Will,</hi> I ſhould not have
had the malitious wit or invention to have charged him, as the forecited Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
hath done me, with the overthrowing of any <hi>Divine Attribute,</hi> or with
<hi>making the Creature a God,</hi> or with <hi>Blaſphemous Arminian Hereſie.</hi> Charitie
would rather have moved me to make this conſtruction of his words. <q>[If
we conſider theſe Three; <hi>Man,</hi> the <hi>Image of God, Goodneſs,</hi> as all of them
were <hi>Objectively</hi> in God before they had any actuall being; Gods Image
might be ſaid to be in the Man, and Goodneſſe in Gods Image, in ſuch a
ſenſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as every <hi>Attribute</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>in the ſubject of apropoſition</hi> abſtract from
ſenſe.]</q> He that ſaith, <hi>Socrates</hi> is a reaſonable creature, muſt acknowledge
reaſon to be in <hi>Socrates.</hi> The connexion between the Subject, and the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute
in Abſtract Propoſitions, is Eſſentiall, and Eternall. So neceſſarie
&amp; ſo eternal was the Connexion between Man made after Gods Image (or ſo
conſidered) and Goodneſs; that whenſoever it ſhould pleaſe God to
give this Subject <hi>[Man after his Image]</hi> actual Being, the Attribute likewiſe,
to wit, <hi>[Goodneſs]</hi> was of neceſſitie to have actuall Being or Coexiſtence with
its Subject, without intervention or interpoſition of any other cauſe. If, beſides
the Act or exerciſe of Gods Will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by which man was created after his Image;
any other Act or exerciſe of his Will, had been neceſſary, or uſeful to make
him actually Good: then Goodneſs or Juſtice original ſhould not have been
Natural, but Supernatural to the Firſt Man; which no good Proteſtant may
grant. The Firſt Mans Goodneſs ſo long as it continued, was continued by
preſervation of Gods Image in him, and cannot be renued, otherwiſe then by
renovation of the ſame Image in him: ſo that <hi>the Goodneſs of God is the Rule of
Goodneſs;</hi> the Ideal Form or patern of Goodneſs in the Creature. The Act or
exerciſe of the Divine Wil makes no creature morally or ſpiritually good, but
by making it conformable unto his own Goodneſs. This and no other was
my meaning in that 13. Chapter, and this my meaning, as I thought, was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently

                  <p>The ſhedding of innocent Blood was evil, before any Law was made againſt

                  <p>
                     <hi>Cain</hi> did ſuffer puniſhment for the Fact, before any poſitive Law, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
any Act of Gods Will declared, to prohibit it. The ſhedding of innocent

did will and command men to obſerve, were onely Good, becauſe
God did will and command them: Hence it is that they are now abroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and their uſe inverted without any change of Gods eternal Will, or of his
Divine Nature. The Negative Precepts concerning Rites and Ceremonies,
have been turned into Affirmatives, and the Affirmatives into Negatives; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the One containeth no other Goodneſſe, nor the Other any Evil in
them, which did not entirely depend upon Gods Poſitive Will to command
or forbid them. And ſeeing <hi>His Will</hi> though moſt Immutable, is immutably
<hi>Free,</hi> though not to do Good or Evil, yet <hi>Free</hi> to make that which is not in its
nature or eſſentially Good, to be Good for One Time or Seaſon, not for
Another; and that which is not in its nature, or eſſentially Evil, (but of an
indifferent nature) to be ſometimes Good and ſometimes Evil; therefore
hath he made the Omiſſion of ſome Ceremonies to be as Good, in latter
times, as their obſervance was in former; and the Obſervance of others to
be as evil, as their former Neglect, or contempt were under the Law, or
from the Date of Gods firſt Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> until the Ratification
or publication of the New Covenant made in Chriſt. <hi>The uncircumciſed

of that which is here commanded, was onely Good, becauſe it
was thus peremptorily willed, commanded, or required by God, not <hi>Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
Good</hi> from eternity; the obſervance of the ſame thing commanded,
is now as dangerous, and diſpleaſing to God, as the neglect or Non-Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance

10 Partly from ignorance of this <hi>Diſtinction</hi> between the nature of things
commanded and forbidden by the <hi>Moral</hi> and <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> partly from ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance
why obedience to the Law of Ceremonies was ſo ſtrictly enjoyned,
and the neglect of it ſo ſeverely puniſhed, oft times by Gods immediate
hand: the Jews were drawn to place as great Sanctity in the obſervance of
Rites and Ceremonies, as in ſincere obedience to the Moral Precepts. This
was one main root of their Hypocriſie, a ſin from which it is ſcarce poſſible
any hearer of the Word ſhould be free, unleſſe he be taught to put ſome
difference between the Nature of things <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> of things comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
and forbidden, beſides the Will or authority of the Commander. If
the Acts or Injunctions of Gods Will were the onely Rule of Goodneſſe, and
had not eternal Goodneſs rather for their Rule, it would be hard to avoid the
<hi>Stoical</hi> error, that <hi>all ſins are equal;</hi> beſides a kinde of <hi>Fatality</hi> in humane affairs,

                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Turks</hi> acknowledge Gods Will to be <hi>a Rule of Goodneſſe,</hi> as ſoveraign as
the author of the forementioned Epiſtle doth; to be ſuch <hi>a Cauſe of Cauſes</hi> as
he would have it. But being ignorant, or not conſidering that there is an
<hi>Immutable goodneſſe</hi> precedent to the Act or exerciſe of Gods Wil; a Goodneſs
whereof his Wil, however conſidered, is no Cauſe; For it is <hi>Coeternal to his Wil,</hi>
to his Wiſdom and Eſſence: they fall into groſly abſurd errours. And
conſequently unto this their ignorance, or to the common error, that all
things are Good onely becauſe God willeth them, they ſometimes highly
commend, and ſometimes deeply diſcommend the ſelf ſame practiſes for
quality and circumſtances with as great vehemency of zeal and ſpirit, and

                  <p>11 But is the like ſin or errour expreſly to be found in <hi>Iſrael?</hi> Do any
make the ſame Fact for nature, qualitie and ſubſtance, to be no ſin in one
man, and yet a ſin in another? or to be a little ſin in one man, and a grievous
outcrying ſin in another? Though they do not avouch this of rebellious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
againſt Prince and State, or of other like publick Facts, Cognoſcible
by humane Law; yet the Principles of <hi>Praedeſtination,</hi> commonly held by
them and the <hi>Turk,</hi> draw them to the like Inconveniences, in transforming
the immutable Rule of Goodneſſe into the ſimilitude of their partial affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
in other Caſes.</p>
                  <p>The Adulterie and murther, which <hi>David,</hi> committed, had been grievous
ſins in any other man, but in <hi>David</hi> being predeſtinated, they were but ſins
of infirmitie: ſins, by which the outward man was defiled, not the inward
man. Such a ſin was inceſt, in <hi>Lot;</hi> ſuch are all the ſins committed by the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect.</hi>
And ſo were all the ſins of the <hi>Elect remitted</hi> before they were commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.
But the Queſtion is, Whether God did ſo abſolutely decree the remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of any mans ſin from eternitie, as that their remiſſion was from eternitie,
abſolutely neceſſarie. If God did abſolutely decree that the ſins of the <hi>Elect</hi>
ſhould be <hi>remitted,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sin not remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted before com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</note> then he did abſolutely decree that they ſhould be <hi>commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi>
For even in Gods eternal Foreknowledge of all things that fall out in
time, the <hi>Commiſſion</hi> of ſins hath precedencie of their <hi>Remiſſion;</hi> and if their
<hi>Remiſſion</hi> were in reſpect of his Foreknowledge or decree, abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
their <hi>Commiſſion</hi> was as neceſſarie. It is impoſſible there ſhould be any
<hi>Remiſſion</hi> of ſins, without a preſuppoſal of their <hi>Commiſſion.</hi> Yet are the
former Concluſions not muttered in corners, but maintained as part of that
holy doctrine which hath been delivered unto us by the maſters of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved
by the beſt writers in reformed Churches.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and the like Doctrines are held in ſo precious eſteem, that if the
lawful Paſtor ſeek to root them out where they have been planted by others,
or to prevent their growth or ſpreading, he ſhall be traduced for an <hi>Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an;</hi>
and as they hope, be ſo cenſured by the high Court of Parliament. But
my hope is, that no <hi>Loyal Elder of Iſrael</hi> ſhall ever ſo far forget himſelf, as ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to attempt or ſeek to have thoſe and the like Concluſions ratified by our
great <hi>Joſuahs</hi> Royal conſent. Sure I am theſe are no branches of that <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,
Catholick, Apoſtolick Faith,</hi> of which we acknowledg our Soveraign Lord
to be the <hi>defender:</hi> and God grant that he may ever defend and keep it pure
and undefiled from theſe and the like Concluſions, that it may defend him
and his people from their adverſaries.</p>
                  <p>12 Yet to ſeek the Correction of theſe and the like <hi>Concluſions,</hi> though
malapertly maintained by ſome of the Flock againſt moſt of their Paſtors,
or the puniſhment of thoſe which ſo maintain them, until the <hi>Principles</hi> from
which they naturally iſſue be checkt or inhibited, were but Tyrannie. Theſe
here related are the leaſt, not the worſt part of thoſe noyſom branches which
ſpring from this one root. <hi>[That Gods irreſiſtible decree for the abſolute Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction

breach of Gods moral Law is there, whereon men will not boldly adventure,
either through deſperation, or preſumption, either openly, or ſecretly? For,
ſeeing <hi>Gods Will,</hi> which in their Divinitie, is the only Cauſe, why the one
sort are deſtinated to death, the other to life, is moſt immutable, and moſt
Irreſiſtible; and ſeeing the <hi>Individual Entities,</hi> or natures of men, unto
which this irreſiſtible Decree is reſpectively terminated, are immutable: let
the one ſort do what they can, pray for themſelves, and beſeech others to
pray for them, they ſhall be damn'd; becauſe their <hi>Entities</hi> or <hi>Individual
Subſtances</hi> are unalterable. Let the other ſort Live as they liſt, they ſhall be
ſaved, becauſe no corruption of manners no change of morality breeds any
mutability or change in their <hi>Individual Natures</hi> or Entities; unto which
Gods immutable Decree is immediatly terminated. Whatſoever become

of ſome, and the abſolute <hi>Reprobation</hi> of others, to the <hi>Individual Natures,</hi>

the queſtion concerning ſuch <hi>abſolute Election;</hi> not the moſt Tyrannical
Lawgiver, that to this day hath breathed on earth, did ever declare himſelf
to be ſo farre the ſon of the Divel, as to make ſolemn decrees againſt mens
perſons, without reſpect, or reference to their Qualifications. It is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertie
of the enemy of mankind to delight in mans puniſhment, as he is a
man or a reaſonable creature: to deſire to have any man as he himſelf now is,
but ſometimes was not, a veſſel capable only of vengeance or punitive juſtice,
alltogether uncapable of Gods free bounty, mercy, or favour. And ſeeing
<pb n="3184" facs="tcp:100044:110"/>
this moſt Honourable Court of <hi>Parliament</hi> now happily aſſembled to make

or Contradiction to this Concluſion (as I hope) among good Chriſtians;
<hi>[God did from eternity decree to reward every man, not according to his Individual

                  <p>15. The imputations laid upon me by the Author of the Epiſtle are heavie
and grievous, if they could be proved; however <hi>moſt injurious,</hi> being made
ſo publick before I heard of them, or could prevent their ſpreading. Yet
for my own part, if it were in my power to cenſure him, my reſolution
ſhould be like to that of a Civilian: when the queſtion was propounded to
him, <hi>[An liceat meretric<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> quaeſtum facere.]</hi> His reſolution as I remember,
(for it was long ſince I read it in <hi>Bodin</hi>) was to this effect, <hi>Peſſimè facit, quòd
artem meretriciam exercet, ſed meretrix cum ſit, non malefacit quod ex arte
quam exercet quaeſtum facit.</hi> The Author of the Epiſtle hath much wronged
himſelf &amp; me, in ſuffering himſelf to be ſo farre miſled with doctrine of
Abſolute <hi>Election,</hi> and <hi>Reprobation,</hi> as it ſeems he is. But being thus farre miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead
by it, and wedded unto it, his practiſe in ſlandering me without any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentance
which as yet I hear of, is but Conſequent to his doctrine, if he were
throughly examined upon it. And he that ſhould puniſh him for
his ſlander, and not condemn his doctrine, ſhould do me ſmall right, and
ſhould do him as much wrong, as he that ſhould puniſh a Scholar for hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a falſe <hi>Concluſion,</hi> without queſtioning or diſproving the <hi>Premiſſes</hi> from
which it neceſſarily followes. For it is as impoſſible for him that thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="3185" facs="tcp:100044:110"/>
to be in the Immutable eſtate of Grace, or <hi>Election,</hi> or is certainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
of his Salvation before his time, to ſuſpect, much leſſe to recant,
any lewd practice, or dangerous errour, whereinto he may fall, untill he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
his Opinion, or his Immature perſwaſion of his own Eſtate; as it is
for any Scholler to revoke a falſe <hi>Concluſion</hi> which ſtill mantains the errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Premiſſes,</hi> out of which it neceſſarily follows.</p>
                  <p>16. The Point then to be proved is, [<hi>That the juſtification of ſlander, how
virulent ſoever, and indulgence to corrupt affections once implanted, do as neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
follow upon Immature and prepoſterous perſwaſions of mens Immutable eſtate in
Grace, or Election, as any Concluſion doth out of its natural Premiſſes.]</hi> Now the
Truth of this Point may be made as clear as any Rule of Art or Reaſon can
make the truth of any other. For it a Rule of nature, tryed and approved
by Art, a Fundamental Principle in both their Schooles, that <hi>An Vniverſal
Negative may be ſimply Converted,</hi> as thus: If no man can be a ſtone or an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate
creature, then no ſtone or inanimate creature can be a man. The
Scripture which is the Rule of Faith, gives us theſe <hi>Vniverſal Negatives;</hi> No
adulterer, no covetous Perſon, no Idolater, no murderer, no ſlanderer or
virulent rayler can inherit the kingdom of God. Theſe <hi>Vniverſal Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi>
being granted and believed; Nature and art, and common reaſon, muſt
admit of their Converſions. No man that muſt enter into the kingdom of
heaven, no man that is truly certain of his ſalvation, can be an Adulterer, can
be a Covetous perſon, can be a murtherer, can be a ſlanderer, or virulent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>er
of his brethern. Now if any man which believes himſelf to be in the
immutable ſtate of <hi>Election</hi> (ſo certain of his ſalvation, that if he inſtantly
dye, he ſhall inſtantly go to heaven) ſhall happen to do the ſame things, that
Adulterers do, that Covetous men do, that murderers ſlanderers, or virulent
revilers do, it will be impoſſible for him to ſuſpect himſelf of being an Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer,
of being Covetous, of being a ſlanderer or reviler, ſo long as his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
perſwaſion concerning his <hi>Abſolute Eſtate</hi> of Salvation, &amp;c. is not recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.
For if he muſt enter into the kingdom of heaven whenſoever he dyes;
if this be a part of his Belief, he cannot believe or ſuſpect that he is a doer of
thoſe things, which whoſoever doth, cannot enter into the kingdome of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.
Thus, as the preſumed <hi>Abſolute Infallibility</hi> of the viſible <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church,
for the time being, doth lay a neceſſity, upon their Succeſſours, of freezing in
the dregs of their Predeceſſours errors: ſo this Immature Perſwaſion of mens
<hi>particular Eſtate in Election,</hi> Grace, or ſalvation, doth lay a like neceſſitie
upon ſuch, as are overtaken with it, of having their hearts hardened with Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie,
with ſecurity, or ſecret indulgence to their corrupt affections. And
for this reaſon amongſt others, did the ſage and Reverend <hi>Reformers</hi> of the
Church, wherein we live, worthily admoniſh, that the Points of <hi>Election<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> and
<hi>Predeſtination,</hi> are to be warily thought upon, they are no fit Themes for every
mans private meditations, much leſs fitt ſeeds to be promiſcuouſly ſowen in
every Congregation by any Seeds-man.</p>
                  <p>17. Had any man in this Kingdom of how diſtempered behaviour ſoever,
ſo he had been ſeaſoned with the knowledg of ingenuous Arts or civil educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſlandered me in his Cups, or Paſſions, amongſt private or common
friends, ſo deeply and upon ſo groſs miſtaking, as the Author of the Epiſtle
hath done, ſlandered me unto the higheſt Authority on earth, his heart in his
ſober thoughts would have ſmitten him long ere this, and I ſhould have had
ſome ingenuous ſatisfaction voluntarily tendred from him. But from men
miſlead with wilde zeale unto the Doctrine of <hi>Abſolute Election and Reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
as it hath of late years been taught by ſome, and from men jealous of
<pb n="3186" facs="tcp:100044:111"/>
others (as if they were <hi>Arminians)</hi> that in this point diſſent from them, I
can expect no voluntary ſatisfaction, but rather continuance of the like;
unleſs I could diſſwade them from their Doctrinal Error. For whileſt this
vail is ſpread over their hearts, envious or malitious ſlander, whileſt it exo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerates
it ſelf upon ſuch, as they ſuſpect for <hi>Achans</hi> and <hi>Arminians,</hi> will be

ſuch naſtie Soloeciſmes or rude ſcurrilitie, as would ſeem loathſom to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
Artiſts, will go current with themſelves and their aſſociates for ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
eloquence; and ſo will ignorance in Philoſophie or School-Divinitie be
applauded for holy Simplicitie.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing their tongues and pens are their own, ſeeing they have caſt off
the yoke of obedience, and begin to proclaim, not mutter <hi>[with our tongues
we will prevail, we are they that ought to ſpeak,</hi> and print books, <hi>Who is Lord
over us?]</hi> Let them uſe what language they pleaſe, the Print-houſes in this
interim poſſeſſed, and imployed by them, ſhall but exerciſe my patience, as
ſome (I hope) by uſurpation, not by juſt Warrant, pulpits, here and there,
ever and anon, for theſe three and twenty years have done; during which
time, whileſt ſuch <hi>Schediaſticks</hi> as theſe have preached of abſolute <hi>Election</hi> or
<hi>Reprobation,</hi> I ſtill have prayed, <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what
they ſaid.</hi> And ſo I ſuppoſe, many more of my profeſſion in this Kingdom
have done. God in the mean while hath enlightened the hearts of many, by
our prayers and miniſtry to ſee their error, and hath made me a witneſſe of
many mens ſorrow for being miſled. And whenſoever the vail ſhall be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
from the heart of ſuch now living in this land, as ſtill maintain that <hi>Rigid
Doctrine,</hi> their ſorrow and compunction will be no leſs, then the ſorrow and
compunction of thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> which had (through ignorance) conſented to the
crucifying of the <hi>Lord of Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>18 The practiſe of the <hi>Jews</hi> was in the iſſue more deſperate, then men in
this age, no leſs zealous of that which they apprehend for truth, can have
opportunity to attempt. But the error which led the <hi>Jews</hi> to that deſperate
practiſe againſt the Son of God is no way impaired, but rather enlarged by
ſome <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of theſe times. Our onely comfort is, that however the
common error of both times be rather ſtrengthened then any way enfeebled
by ſuch in our times as nurſe it, yet is it neither ſo general, nor ſo inveterate
in this land, as it was in the Jewiſh nation before their final deſtruction. The
Governours of our Church and State, the learned Paſtors, or conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Layity, are not ſo infected with it, as the Phariſees, Scribes, and Elders
in <hi>Judea</hi> were in our Saviours time. Their exceſſive pride and Hypocriſie
made them ſo extraordinarily impatient of reproof and contradiction, and
their extraordinary impatience of reproof in matters of practiſe, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction
in point of opinion, hatched that cruel and murtherous hate againſt
<hi>the Son of God.</hi> The ſetled matter of their deadly malice was pride, and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie
of heart; that wherewith this corrupt matter was continually fed,
was paſſionate zeal to maintain the <hi>Abſolute Election</hi> of their Nation, and the
<hi>Abſolute Rejection</hi> of the Gentiles; humorous perſwaſion of their own <hi>immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
eſtate in Gods promiſe,</hi> firſt occaſioned or ſtrengthened by reflecting upon
the accurate reformation, which (to their ſeeming) they had made of their
forefathers Idolatry, of Sabbath-breaking, &amp; other palpable tranſgreſſions of
Gods Law. But however, crueltie and fury have no ſuch Objects to practiſe
upon in theſe latter dayes as the <hi>Jews,</hi> and as the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> had:
yet is not bodily death a more Uſual effect of peſtilent feavers, then ſlander,
perſecution, crueltie, and murderous hate are in all Ages, of ignorant zeale,
<pb n="3187" facs="tcp:100044:111"/>
and hypocriſie. Nor do putrified or malignant humours, more uſually
breed peſtilent feavers, or other dangerous diſeaſes, in mens bodies; then
immature perſwaſions of their own <hi>Immutable eſtate in Grace,</hi> or indigeſted
reſolution concerning <hi>abſolute Election or Reprobation,</hi> do hatch pride and hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrifie
in mens ſoules. And the moſt infallible Symptome of pride, and
hypocriſie, is Jealouſly of being contradicted by ſuch as contradict them not,
or impatiency of meer Logical Contradiction, without gallor bitterneſs, in
point of Opinion. Another Accidental Improvement of the Jews murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
hate againſt <hi>our Saviour,</hi> was the hotneſs and blindneſs of their zeal to
<hi>Moſes's</hi> writings. Yet were not <hi>Moſes's</hi> writings in higher eſteem with
them, then <hi>St. Paules</hi> Epiſtles are deſervedly with us. And would to God,
ſome amongſt us did not further miſtake or pervert his ſcope and aim in that
9. Chapter to the Romanes, then the Jewes did <hi>Moſes's</hi> meaning.</p>
                  <p>But the Parallel between the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> miſperſwaſions of love and <hi>zeale</hi> to

<hi>mercy,</hi> what <hi>Love,</hi> or <hi>Goodneſs</hi> is. The beſt
Picture that can be taken of Sathan, would
be the true Characters of Falſhood, malice,
hatred, crueltie, envy. Yet by this Good
Authours leave, however Sathan be the Father of lyes, the Author of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice,
the hatcher of envy and hatred, the Com-plotter of cruelty; yet can
he not ſo truly and properly be called falſhood it ſelf, envy it ſelf, hatred it
ſelf, cruelty it ſelf, in the abſtract, as God is ſaid to be <hi>Truth it ſelf, Love it
ſelf, Mercy it ſelf, and Goodneſs it ſelf.</hi> For though falſhood, hatred, envie,
cruelty, &amp;c. <hi>be now become Natural</hi> to the old Serpent; yet were they <hi>adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious
to his prime nature</hi> and ſubſtance; he was not from the beginning in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted
with theſe or the like habits. But if the Opinion of ſome men a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
us concerning <hi>abſolute Reprobation</hi> were from above, He, whom we
profeſſe to be the Almightie Creatour of heaven and earth, ſhould be as
truly and properly falſhood it ſelf, hatred it ſelf, cruelty it ſelf; as he is Truth
it ſelf. Love it ſelf, Mercy it ſelf, Goodneſs it ſelf. The Branches of the
Doctrine concerning <hi>Abſolute Reprobation,</hi> which bear this Fruit are (to omit
others for the preſent) ſpecially theſe <hi>Two.</hi> The <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Gods punitive Juſtice, was a part of the Object of Gods Primary
Will, and an exerciſe of his Will, as directly, as immediatly, and as irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtibly
intended by him in the Creation; as the manifeſtation of his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
&amp; Bounty, or reſervation of his mercy to ſuch as ſhall be ſaved, was. The
<hi>Second,</hi> That God from Eternity did as truly hate all thoſe who periſh, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

Now if the number of ſuch as periſh, be much greater, then the number of
ſuch as ſhall be ſaved; and if the ſame God did from eternitie as truly hate
the greater ſort of men, as he did love the leſſe, without all reſpect or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to their works or qualifications; if he did out of his eternal hatred,
as peremptorily decree the endleſs torments of the <hi>One,</hi> as he did the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
happineſs of the <hi>Other:</hi> Theſe <hi>Concluſions of the Lutherans</hi> (avouched
by them, in ſome <hi>Catechiſmes</hi> (which I have ſeen) before the name of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minius</hi>
was heard of in theſe Parts) will neceſſarily follow, <hi>viz.</hi> That ſuch
as maintain this rigid doctrine of <hi>Abſolute Reprobation,</hi> do not believe in, or
acknowledge, the ſame God, which the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> with all antiquitie, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge:
for they acknowledge their God to be Truth, Mercy, Love,
and Goodneſſe; whereas the ſtiffe maintainers of <hi>Abſolute Reprobation</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
their God, to be hatred, and Crueltie it ſelf. Now to acknowledge one
and the ſame God to be Truth, Love, Mercy, and Goodneſſe itſelf in reſpect
of ſome; and in reſpect of others, to be falſhood, hatred, crueltie it ſelf, is a
groſſſer Hereſie or Transformation of the Deity, then was the Hereſie of the
<hi>Manichees,</hi> which acknowledge <hi>Two Gods,</hi> or independent Originals of all
things; the <hi>One</hi> as Fountain of all <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> the <hi>Other,</hi> the Authour of all <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill.</hi>
For avoyding theſe and the like <hi>Concluſions,</hi> no evaſion or obſervation
hath been or can be pretended, by ſuch as make the <hi>Entity or Individual Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
of man the Formal Objects of Reprobation,</hi> beſides this One, <hi>viz.</hi> That Gods
Will is ſo the Rule of Goodneſs, that if he will the death of all that dye
without reſpect unto their works or Qualifications, this muſt be Good. If
he be pleaſed to hate the greater Part of mankind without all reference to
their Qualifications, the hatred of them muſt be as good, as his Love of
thoſe few which ſhall be ſaved. And the Apoſtle did adviſe them to reſt
upon this anſwer, when he ſaith, <hi>O man! who art thou that diſputeſt againſt
God; ſhall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou
made me thus? hath not the Potter power over the clay, &amp;c.</hi> But whether this
Uſe of our Apoſtles Doctrine in that place, be according to his meaning, or
whether any <hi>Concluſion</hi> can be drawn from that Chapter which may make
for <hi>abſolute Election or Reprobation,</hi> is elſewhere examined. By that which
hath been ſaid,<note place="margin">See Chapt. 42. Numb. 9. 10.</note> it may appear, that ſuch in this Land as ſtifly hold the <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net
of abſolute Reprobation</hi> (which the Chriſtian world beſides hath for the
moſt part forſaken) have ſome reaſon, though no juſt cauſe to queſtion the
truth delivered by me, in what ſenſe Gods Will is ſaid to be the Rule of
Goodneſs. For unleſſe they can diſprove my Tenet, (which God be prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
hath ſtronger Supporters then my weakneſſe can afford) they muſt
either revoke their errour, or admit God to be more then the Author of ſin,
as truly <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>; as properly <hi>ſin it ſelf,</hi> as <hi>Being it ſelf,</hi> or life it ſelf.
And yet if they could perſwade the ignorant, that Gods Will is the Rule of
Goodneſs in ſuch a ſenſe as they would make it; the Inconveniences which the
<hi>Lutherans</hi> object, would be rather for a while removed, then cleerely avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
They might be preſt upon them again, with greater force and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
with this addition that they maintain the <hi>Turkiſh Opinion</hi> concerning
Fate and Providence. And upon this Ground only (as I conceive) do the
the <hi>Lutherans</hi> inſtile the <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> Limbs of <hi>Gog,</hi> or of the <hi>Eastern Antichriſt.</hi>
But the beſt is, that of ſuch who at this day do not diſclaim the name of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts,</hi>
the moſt and beſt learned diſlike the opinion of <hi>Abſolute Reprobation,</hi>
and ſo I hope in good time will every faithfull Paſtor in the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
and every <hi>Loyal Elder in this our Iſrael.</hi> For admit we could make full
proofe unto the Congregations committed to our Charge, that <hi>Papiſtry</hi> is, as
<pb n="3189" facs="tcp:100044:112"/>
ſome have enſtiled it, the <hi>Ocean of Hereſies;</hi> that the <hi>Abſolute Infallibility</hi> of the
<hi>Pope</hi> or Conſiſtory exceeds the mixture or combination of all other particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Hereſies which have been; that the Idolatry which the <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks
from the belief of the <hi>Pope</hi> or Churches abſolute Infallibilitie are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
to commit and practiſe, doth equalize the Idolatry of thoſe heathens
which ſolemnly worſhipt the Divel; yet all this being proved by us, and firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
believed by our flocks, would be of ſmall force or ſway, to retain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
men in their Allegiance to their <hi>Soveraign Lord,</hi> or in obedience
to the Lawes Eccleſiaſtick or Civil of this Kingdom, if once the Doctrine of
<hi>Abſolute Reprobation</hi> might be faſtened upon the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or be
embraced by her Learned Paſtors or Governours. For ſo they might as
concludently prove us to be as groſſe Hereticks as we ſay they are; and evince
our Churches doctrine to be as Blaſphemous, as theirs is Idolatrous.</p>
                  <p>To have <hi>this Rigid Doctrine</hi> generally embraced or acknowledged by us, or at
leaſt to have the World believe that it were generally acknowledged by us,
is the very Thing, and the main buſineſs which the Factors for the <hi>Romiſh

wherein <hi>Sathan</hi> hopes to catch this Iſland: he hath ſet the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> to ſpread

they have long uſed our Pulpits and Print-houſes, ſo they attempt to uſe
ſome in our <hi>Parliaments</hi> as their Podders, to drive us into it. Their prey they
know muſt needs be great, if they can bring us into theſe ſtraights, or put a
neceſſity of this hard choice upon us. Whether were better, to live in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to a Church, which adores wicked and naughty men, Divels incarnate,

With the <hi>Hiſtorie of Joſeph</hi> I am not at this time to meddle, any further, then

with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or of <hi>The manner how,</hi> or of <hi>The means by which</hi> He harden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him.</p>
                  <p>2 So long as that great, and (in his kinde) Religious <hi>Pharaoh</hi> lived,
(whoſe life, and proſperous eſtate of the kingdom whereof he was Lord,
<hi>Joſeph</hi> by <hi>Gods</hi> good Providence, and peculiar inſtructions, had both pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved

All of them from the higheſt to the loweſt fared well for <hi>Joſephs</hi> ſake: and
(which was more then all the matter of their well-fare) the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
whom they ſojourned, did not envie or repine at their proſperitie;
at leaſt they durſt not profeſs any enmity or attempt to wreak their malice
(if they had conceived any) againſt them. The freſh memory of <hi>Joſephs</hi>
good deſervings at the Kings, Princes, and Peoples hands, did prevent all
practiſes of Hoſtilitie or repining crueltie (though but intended againſt
them) ſo long as that <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> which had ſo well rewarded <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and had
him in ſo great eſteem, did ſway the Scepter of <hi>Egypt.</hi> But it ſeems that this
gracious King dyed about the ſame time that <hi>Joſeph</hi> did, or rather before
him. For <hi>Moſes</hi> inſtructs us, <hi>Exod. 1. 8. There aroſe a new King which knew not
Joſeph</hi> (that is, either had no <hi>Memorial Record,</hi> or took <hi>no notice</hi> how well
he had deſerved both of the King and Kingdom of <hi>Egypt.) And he ſaid unto
his people, Behold, The people of the children of Iſrael are greater and mightier
then we,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Joſephus in his ſecond book of Judaical Antiquities</hi> informs us,
(and his information will much advance the true value of the <hi>Literal Senſe</hi> of
the <hi>Sacred Context</hi> according to the Original) that this latter <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> or
new King, mentioned by <hi>Moſes, Chap. 1. verſ.</hi> 3. was of another Line; no

Son or Heir, unleſſe by Adoption of that great <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and Grand Patron of
<hi>Joſeph,</hi> but at the beſt, of ſome <hi>Collateral Line.</hi> Now whether it were out
of Real Fear, or out of Pride of heart, or Popularitie: This new King to
give ſome Document in the beginning of his Reign, of more care and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
for maintaining and advancing the welfare of the Natives, then his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor
had practiſed, (who had placed his ſpecial favours upon forraigners

                  <p>The <hi>Firſt Project</hi> of this new King was to keep the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> from Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinie
(whereunto their number might, as he thought, provoke or tempt
them) by laying the yoke of ſervitude and hard labour upon them. But
perceiving that the more he did preſs them, the more they multiplied and

                  <p>Neither of theſe <hi>Two Projects were any part of Gods Ordination or Deſign:</hi>

of all <hi>Bloodie Politicians,</hi> and chief maſter of all unhallowed Policies. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
the entertainment of this Satanical Suggeſtion, and the putting of it in
execution by Royal Authoritie and Command, was an <hi>Inchoation</hi> or rather
a large meaſure of that <hi>Ordination</hi> or <hi>Coaptation</hi> of this Kingdom and State
to <hi>that deſtruction</hi> whereof our Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Rom. 9. 22. What if God, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

And it came to paſs in proceſs of time, that the King of Egypt dyed, and the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of Iſrael ſighed by reaſon of the bondage,</hi> &amp;c. and is expreſly avouched
by <hi>Joſephus in his ſecond Book of Jewiſh Antiquities, Chap.</hi> 5. However, this
other <hi>Pharaoh</hi> becoming Succeſſor to that cruel King mentioned <hi>Exod.</hi> 1. 8.
not in <hi>Place</hi> onely, but in <hi>Cruelty</hi> and oppreſſion: the wickedneſs and
wrongs practiſed by the <hi>former Pharaoh</hi> and his ſubjects, are charged upon
<hi>the Second</hi> and his people; becauſe they were bound by the Law of God,
and by the Law of Nature to have given better <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>
then they did; ſo much at leaſt as <hi>Moſes</hi> in his <hi>Firſt meſſage</hi> to <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod.

capable of, or rather more fitly diſpoſed to that <hi>Obduration</hi> which befel
him; becauſe he could not be ignorant of the ill ſucceſs which his Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
cruel intentions againſt the <hi>Infant-Males,</hi> had found. It was the former
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> main Project to deſtroy the <hi>Hebrew-Males:</hi> And in the heat of this
perſecution, <hi>Moſes</hi> is born, but hid for three months from <hi>Pharaohs Firrets,</hi>
(or <hi>blood-hounds</hi> rather) by his Parents. This providence in his parents was
not from ſecret <hi>Inſtinct of Nature,</hi> but from <hi>True Faith,</hi> or ſupernatural <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,</hi>
as our Apoſtle inſtructs us, <hi>Heb. 11. 23. By Faith Moſes when he was
born, was hid three months of his parents; becauſe they ſaw that he was a proper
child, and they not afraid of the Kings commandment.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="3192" facs="tcp:100044:114"/>
4. <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us that the <hi>Occaſion</hi> which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> took to murther all the
<hi>Hebrew Males,</hi> was from a conſtant Fame or <hi>Praenotion</hi> ſuggeſted unto him by a
<hi>Secretary of ſtate;</hi> That about this time there ſhould an <hi>Hebrew Male</hi> be born
that ſhould work wonders for the good of his People: and their good could
not be diſlinked from the <hi>Egyptians</hi> harmes or loſſes; although no better
fortune were to befall them, then their ſafe eſcape out of the Land without
any juſt revenge upon their Oppreſſors. Some <hi>Praenotion</hi> or <hi>Revelation</hi> of
that (which <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſaith) had been made to <hi>Moſes</hi> his Parents, and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by them; and made them the more careful, Firſt, to hide him, then to
commend him to Gods Providence in an Ark of Bulruſhes, floting down the
river, to which it is Probable they knew <hi>Pharaohs Daughter</hi> did uſually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort.
Their wiſdome in the contrivance was more then Natural; a true
work or ſuggeſtion of <hi>Faith:</hi> the diſpoſition of all Occurrences to effect
their hope beyond their expectation, was an <hi>Extraordinary Act of Gods pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
Providence.</hi> After the Adoption of <hi>Moſes</hi> to be the ſon of <hi>Pharaoh Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi>
we read not of the continuation of the former Butchery: Nor is it Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
it ſhould continue after <hi>Moſes</hi> came to <hi>years of Proof,</hi> enabled to give
pregnant Documents of his worth as well in Martiall as in Civil affaires.
Whether he were intended and deſigned (as <hi>Joſephus</hi> tells us he was) to be
Heir vnto the kingdom of of <hi>Egypt,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Antiqu. Lib. 2. Chap. 5.</note> (this Cruel king having no child beſides
his <hi>Merciful</hi> Daughter; nor ſhe any child of her Body;) we dare not Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily
avouch or gainſay. Or whether <hi>Moſes</hi> did that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (whoſe
Daughter had ſaved his life) that Admirable Service in ſubduing the
<hi>Ethiopians,</hi> as <hi>Joſephus</hi> in the ſame Place relates, be believed or waived; Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable
it is that either by <hi>This</hi> or <hi>ſome Other</hi> great Service done by him in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>
or for the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> it was foreſhewed, ſo as his Brethren might have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood,
That God had ſome great work in hand to be wrought by Him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the meer killing of the <hi>Egyptian</hi> that had wronged one of the <hi>Hebrewes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whatſoever good Intentions this <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had towards <hi>Moſes</hi> for his
Daughters ſake, before he killed the <hi>Egyptian;</hi> it is evident that he hated
him extreamly afterwards for this very Fact; and that <hi>Moſes</hi> for fear of
his diſpleaſure left <hi>Egypt,</hi> and ſojourned many years in <hi>Midian, Exod.</hi> 2. 15.
<hi>Now it came to paſſe in proceſſe of time, (ſaith</hi> the ſacred Story, ver. 23.) that the
king of <hi>Egypt</hi> (that King whoſe Daughter had ſaved <hi>Moſes's</hi> life; yea the ſame
who ſought to ſlay <hi>Moſes</hi> for killing the <hi>Egyptian)</hi> dyed: But the great and
grievous oppreſſion of the poor <hi>Iſraelies</hi> did not die with him; <hi>mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarunt
Dominum, non ſervitutem;</hi> they were freed from this one cruel Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor,
but not from cruel Oppreſſion: For there aroſe another Tyrant
as bad or worſe then <hi>this</hi> under whoſe heavie yoke, <hi>The Children of Iſrael
ſighed by reaſon of the bondage, and they cryed, and their cry came up unto God, by
by reaſon of the bondage. And God heard their groaning, and God remembred his
Covenant with Abraham, with Iſaac, and with Jacob. And God looked upon the
Children of Iſrael, and God had reſpect unto them,</hi> Exod. 2. 23, 24, 25. Unto <hi>This
Later of the Two bad Pharaos,</hi> who had no ſpleen againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> in particular,
as being perhaps unknown unto him by face, is <hi>Moſes</hi> commanded to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs

yeild Obedience unto his <hi>Commiſſion: Secondly,</hi> that after his Brethren were
perſwaded that God had ſent him unto them, it was (as he foreſaw) very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible,
<pb n="3193" facs="tcp:100044:114"/>
that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would give any Credence, either to him, or to the
Elders of Iſrael, whether joyntly or ſeverally imployed in this <hi>Great
Buſsneſſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>5. That full meaſure of <hi>Induration</hi> or hardneſſe of heart which after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
fell upon this ſecond <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> was no otherwiſe wrought by God,
then by reiterated, gentle, and civil Checks of that unhallowed Reſolution
begun by his Predeceſſour and continued by him. In the moſt of <hi>Moſes's</hi>
Meſſages unto him, <hi>God</hi> (whoſe Embaſſador <hi>Moſes</hi> was) did adviſe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand
him to do as in juſtice and equitie he ought to have done; but no
way neceſſitate him to do as he did. The <hi>Tenor</hi> of <hi>Moſes's</hi> Advertiſements
unto him was; <hi>Firſt,</hi> to relinquiſh all former Reſolutions or intendments of
Oppreſſion unto the <hi>Iſraelites.</hi> And <hi>Secondly,</hi> to make ſome equitable ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
for the wrongs formerly done unto them. All this <hi>Pharaoh</hi> might
have done: and all this any wiſe man, which had feared God and hated co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs,
would have done. But for this <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> as he was (no doubt)
wiſe enough for worldly buſineſs, ſo he was exceeding proud, exceeding co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous;
and by theſe qualities, To-God-ward, moſt unwiſe. So that <hi>his
Pride and Covetouſneſſe did directly and immediately harden his heart.</hi> On Gods
Part we may not Imagin or ſuſpect any other Cauſalitie of hardening him,
beſides the Propoſal of thoſe Conditions unto him, whoſe Performance he
knew was very <hi>Incompatible,</hi> though not <hi>Incompoſſible</hi> with haughty Pride or
tenacious avarice. The only <hi>Neceſſitie</hi> which God in his alſeeing Wiſdom
put upon him, was, either to break his Reſolution and work a Relentance
or releaſe of thoſe cruel Practices and oppreſſions towards the <hi>Iſra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>6. To deſcend to a more Particular Survey of the Pride and avarice of
theſe two <hi>Pharaohs.</hi> We are to take our <hi>Hint</hi> or <hi>Riſe</hi> from that Paſſage ſet

multiply, and it come to paſſe, that when there falleth out any warr, they joyn alſo
unto our Enemies, and fight againſt us, and ſo get them up out of the Land:</hi> This
was the utmoſt of the former <hi>Pharaohs</hi> fear in the beginning of his Project
againſt them. But what Cauſe had he to fear their departure out of the land,
ſeeing they could not carry with them the lands and Poſeſſions which his
Predeceſſour, <hi>Joſeph's good Lord and Patron,</hi> had beſtowed upon them? Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
this haughty Prince did politickly foreſee, that the recovery of theſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions
to the Egyptians, or Confiſcation of their Perſonal Eſtates, could
not be ſo beneficial unto him as the Poſſeſſion of their Lives and bodily Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice:
for even theſe, according to the Cuſtom of thoſe times, were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<hi>In bonis ipſius,</hi> as his proper goods and Chattels. <hi>Now to be Lord of ſo
many Slaves (for under this Title he challenged them) was a grater Revenew,
then any Prince beſides himſelf in thoſe times had;</hi> and a great deal more, then all
the Land of <hi>Goſhen</hi> which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> then poſſeſſed was worth. And this
Revenew he ſaw would grow greater every day, albeit his Predeceſſors
cruel Project againſt the Male-children had ſucceeded according to his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
for the Female Sex would ſtill have multiplyed; and theſe he thought
to be a ſecure Poſſeſſion, as being not likely to make inſurrection againſt
him, or to become confederates in warr with his Enemies. Nor is it probable
that either of the two <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ever intended the extirpation of the males
any further, then that they might have enough to propagate ſuch a perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all

wicked againſt any other People under heaven, then againſt the Seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi>
and of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> becauſe theſe were <hi>the Lords own inheritance; His Peculiar
Charge.</hi> This People when they were firſt invited into <hi>Egypt</hi> was
ſcarce an <hi>Oligarchie;</hi> a ſmall Congregation of men indued with no
other power or Juriſdiction, but only ſuch as every Father of a Familie
hath over his Children and Grand-children and theirs. And this Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
after <hi>Jacobs</hi> death was divided amongſt his ſons: Every one of them was
a <hi>Patriarch,</hi> that is, <hi>a Chief</hi> over his own Tribe or <hi>Clan.</hi> Nor had theſe
<hi>twelve Patriarchs</hi> any Civil or Coercive Power one over another, or reſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctively
over their ſeveral Families, after they ſetled in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but as the
King and State of <hi>Egypt</hi> would permit or allow of. Not any power at all
to make any Warr whether offenſive or defenſive; or Leagues of Peace
with any other Nation. Free-men notwithſtanding they were <hi>de jure;</hi> and
this new King of <hi>Egypt</hi> which knew not <hi>Joſeph,</hi> (much leſſe conſidered upon

yoke of ſlavery upon their necks. Yet how to right themſelves they knew
not; as having no Superior Lord on earth unto whom they might appeal
from <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> But the more deſtitute they were of any help from earth,
the more eaſie and ſpeedy entrance their Prayers found into heaven: their
teares and cries were accepted of the Lord God of their Fathers for more

after the firſt hard-hearted <hi>Pharaohs</hi> death) the Lord himſelf vouchſafed to
to become their King; not in general only (as he is <hi>Lord</hi> of all Lords, and
<hi>King</hi> of all Kings, and People throughout the World) but in a Proper and
peculiar manner. Whatſoever Authoritie or Power of Juriſdiction the
Kings or Supreme Majeſties of other Nations or Soveraignties did exerciſe,
or by Divine permiſſion and Ordinance of Providence do now exerciſe over
their People, (as Power of Life and death, or of making Lawes, or Leagues,
whether of Peace or Warr with other States;) all theſe and the like Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives
the Lord of heaven and earth did reſerve immediately unto himſelf
alone, over the Seed of <hi>Jacob</hi> and of <hi>Abraham his Friend.</hi> Upon the Lords
Reſervation of this Royal Power entire unto himſelf, <hi>Moſes</hi> is delegated to
be his <hi>Embaſſador</hi> unto the King and State of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and conſtituted his Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
or <hi>Vice-Roy</hi> over <hi>Iſrael</hi> Nor ſhall the Reader whether Chriſtian or other
be ever able to underſtand the Literal or Punctual meaning of the Hiſtorie of
<hi>Exodus</hi> to the 14. chapter, or of thoſe places in <hi>St Paules Epiſtle to the Romans</hi>
which referre unto that Hiſtorie, unleſſe he take <hi>This Rule or Principle</hi> along
with him whil'ſt he reads them, viz. <hi>[That all the Meſſages which Moſes
delivered to Pharaoh from God, &amp; all the Anſwers which Pharaoh returned by him
were true and formal Treaties of a Legal and Solemn Embaſſage.]</hi> The Law of
Nature and of Nations was never ſo accurately obſerved by any Embaſſador
as it was by <hi>Moſes</hi> (whilſt he exerciſed this Function) in his many <hi>Treaties</hi>
with <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> One Principal, if not the only Fact, that can come within the
Suſpicion of Injuſtice on <hi>Moſes's</hi> part, was the ſpoyling the <hi>Egyptians</hi> of their
Jewels. But if we conſider what unſufferable wrongs the King and people
of <hi>Egypt</hi> had done unto this People of God, which had now become His Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
Subjects or his <hi>Proprietarie Lieges;</hi> This Fact even by Courſe of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
Law, or Law of Nations, was more juſtifyable, then Royall Grants
of Letters of Mart, or other like remedies againſt ſuch other Nations as have
wronged their Subjects, or ſuffered them to be wronged by any under their

to fight for <hi>Iſrael</hi> againſt the <hi>Egyptians.</hi> All the ſeveral Armies of inferiour
Creatures, which brought the many enſuing plagues upon the <hi>Egyptians,</hi>

which the controverſie was: and that was the preſent libertie, or

the Lord had ſaid unto Moſes in Midian, Go, return to Egypt: for they are all dead
which went about to kill thee: Then Moſes took his Wife, and his Sons, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

people of</hi> Iſrael <hi>believed that</hi> the Lord had viſited the children of Iſrael, and had
looked down upon their tribulation: <hi>And upon this Belief,</hi> they bowed down and

And Pharaoh ſaid, who is the Lord, that I ſhould hear his voice and let Iſrael go? I

and</hi> Aaron <hi>his Interpreter;</hi> [Moſes and Aaron, why cauſe ye the people to ceaſe

Choler or Superciliousneſs only againſt</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>but againſt the
whole People of Iſrael; on whoſe behalf God had made them his Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors:
For,</hi> Pharaoh ſaid furthermore, behold, much people is now in the Land, and
ye make them leave their burdens. Therefore Pharaoh gave commandement the
ſame day unto the Taſk-maſters of the people, and to their Officers, ſaying, Ye ſhall give
the people no more ſtraw to make brick, (as in time paſt) but let them go and gather
them ſtraw themſelves. Notwithſtanding lay upon them the number of brick
which they made in time paſt, diminiſh nothing thereof: for they be Idle, therefore

                  <p>13. That which did moſt diſcourage <hi>Moſes</hi> from having any more to
deal with <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> was his Experience of his uninclineable diſpoſition to any
good Motion which he could make on the behalf of Gods People. And this
diffidence or backwardneſſe in <hi>Moſes,</hi> received Nutriment from the way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
and grumbling diſpoſition of the Iſraelitiſh People againſt him and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,</hi>
after <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had given them a peremptory charge to perform the ſame
task, which they had done before when they had allowance of ſtraw from the
<hi>Egyptians. Then the Officers of the children of Iſrael ſaw themſelves in an evil caſe,
<pb n="3197" facs="tcp:100044:116"/>
becauſe it was ſaid, Ye ſhall diminiſh nothing of your brick, nor of every daies
task. And they met Moſes and Aaron, who ſtood in the way, as they came forth
from Pharaoh: And they ſaid unto them, The Lord look upon you, and judge,
becauſe you have made our ſavour to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in
the eyes of his ſervants, to put a ſword in their hand to ſlay us,</hi> verſe 19,

                  <p>After the Lord had given <hi>Moſes</hi> more <hi>Special Inſtructions</hi> and new En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements,
<hi>Chapt. 6. verſ.</hi> 1. and laid a ſtronger Tie upon him and <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>
to deliver his Meſſage unto <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> then he did upon <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to obey
it; <hi>[And the Lord ſpake unto Moſes, ſaying, Go in, ſpeak unto Pharaoh King
of Egypt, that he let the children of Iſrael go out of his land. And Moſes
ſpake before the Lord, ſaying, Behold<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the children of Iſrael have not hearkened

the Lord ſaid to Moſes, Behold, I have made thee Pharaohs God, and Aaron thy
brother ſhall be thy prophet. Thou ſhalt ſpeak all that I command thee, and Aaron
thy brother ſhall ſpeak unto Pharaoh that he ſend the children of Iſrael out of his
land.</hi> Here was a great <hi>Incouragement</hi> to undertake ſo hard a Service. But
what <hi>Incouragement</hi> could either <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Aaron</hi> take from the next paſſage
of Gods <hi>Inſtructions</hi> or <hi>Declaration</hi> of His Will unto them, <hi>verſe</hi> 3? <hi>[But I
will harden Pharaohs heart, and multiply my miracles and my wonders in the

the Lords commands, was his ſuſpicion or preſumption that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would
not hearken to him, nor regard his Signs, as Aequivalent to <hi>Letters of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi>
How then ſhould he take heart and courage by knowing that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
which before he did but ſuſpect or fear, to wit, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> would
not, or that he could not hearken unto him? Now thus much <hi>Moſes</hi> could

                        </gap>ſeth to let the people go:</hi> which can imply no other hardening then ſuch
as did reſult or rebound upon the ſight or conſideration of the wonder.
Upon the exhibition of the <hi>ſecond Sign,</hi> to wit, the turning of the waters of
Pooles and Rivers into bloud, which was ſomewhat more fearful then the
former; <hi>Moſes</hi> his expreſſion of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> diſpoſition is <hi>Imperſonal,</hi> ver. 22.
<hi>And Pharaohs heart was hardened.</hi> And it was no extraordinarie wonder that his
hart ſhould be hardned again, in ſuch a ſenſe or after ſuch a manner as it was
upon the ſight of the <hi>firſt Wonder;</hi> ſeeing the Magicians or ſorcerers did the like:
Thus much only may ſeem extraordinarie or to carrie a great deal of odds
on <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aarons</hi> behalf, in that this plague could not be removed by any
<pb n="3199" facs="tcp:100044:117"/>
Magicians Spell or ſkill in ſorcerie; but onely by <hi>Moſe's</hi> prayers unto God.
This might well have wrought relentance in any ordinarie Heathen Prince,
which had but the patience to take the circumſtances into conſideration. But
the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> (to my apprehenſion) gives the true reaſon why, and by what
means <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart was at this time hardened, <hi>verſe 23. And Pharaoh
turned and went into his houſe, neither did he ſet his heart to this alſo.</hi> And
his not ſetting his heart to <hi>This Wonder</hi> with its circumſtances, did bring a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitie
upon him to have his heart hardened in ſome further degree then it
had been with the <hi>Firſt wonder.</hi> But <hi>Pharaoh</hi> (as we read) was more terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
with the ſight of the Froggs; which notwithſtanding the Egyptian Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians
did by ſorcerie produce, or at leaſt which <hi>Pharaoh</hi> their Maſter was
perſwaded that they did produce.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Production</hi> could not be without his help; nor the <hi>Perſwaſion</hi> but
by his permiſſion or ſufferance, who had enabled <hi>Moſes</hi> to do this ſtrange
work: In which <hi>This</hi> is moſt remarkable, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi> ſhould ſo earneſtly
entreat <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to remove this plague, or to confine the Froggs
unto the River onely, <hi>verſe 8. Then Pharaoh called for Moſes and Aaron;
and ſaid, Intreat the Lord that he may take away the froggs from me, and from
my people, and I will let the people go, that they may do ſacrifice unto the Lord.</hi>
And <hi>Moſes</hi> is as readie to grant, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was earneſt to requeſt this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of him, <hi>verſe 9, 10, 11. And Moſes ſaid unto Pharaoh: Glorie over
me;</hi> (that is, you ſhall command me.) <hi>When ſhall I intreat for thee, and
for thy ſervants, and for thy people, to deſtroy the froggs from thee and thy
houſes, that they may remain in the river onely? And he ſaid, Tomorrow. And
he ſaid, Be it according to thy word, that thou mayſt know that there is none like
unto the Lord our God. And the froggs ſhall depart from thee, and from thy hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
and from thy ſervants, and from thy people: they ſhall remain in the river
onely.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this relentance in <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was but like the Divels vow to turn Monk
in a languiſhing Fit, but as ſoon as the Fit was off him (as the Fable is) he
turned to his wonted <hi>Byas,</hi> and became, and ſo continues, an erranter knave
then he was before: For ſo it follows, <hi>verſe 15. But when Pharaoh ſaw
that there was reſpite, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not unto them as the
Lord had ſaid.</hi> This cannot be underſtood ſave onely of ſuch an <hi>Indirect</hi> or
<hi>Concomitant Obduration</hi> as hath before been expreſſed, that is, a Reſumption
of his former proud and avaritious Reſolutions; the Reſultance of which
could be no other but a meaſure of Induration ſo much greater then the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
that had befallen him, by how much the ſight of the Froggs had mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
his heart more then the two former wonders had done. Yet doth not
<hi>Pharaoh</hi> upon the ſight of any of theſe three, bewray ſuch a ſtubborn wilfull
diſpoſition, as he did upon the exhibition of the <hi>Fourth Miracle,</hi> which his
Enchanters did plainly confeſs ſurpaſſed their ſkill, <hi>Chapt. 8. 18, 19. And
the Magicians did ſo with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could
not: ſo there were lice upon man and upon beaſt. Then the Magicians ſaid unto
Pharaoh, This is THE FINGER OF GOD: And Pharaohs heart was
hardened, and he hearkened not unto them as the Lord had ſaid.</hi> The finger of
God then was remarkable in <hi>Working the Miracle</hi> which the Magicians could
not; but no way remarkable in <hi>hardning Pharaoh:</hi> Nor is it either ſaid or
intimated, that the <hi>Finger of God did harden Pharaohs heart, but Pharaohs
heart remained obstinate: and he hearkened not unto them as the Lord had ſaid,
verſe</hi> 19. His not hearkening unto them, was the cauſe of his Indura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3200" facs="tcp:100044:118"/>
16. But this <hi>Miracle</hi> of the lice was to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> more loathſome, then ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible:
And for this reaſon haply he did not either ſo fairly or ſo earneſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat
<hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to pray for him, as he had done upon the ſight of the
Froggs: and as he ſtraight way after did upon the noyſome experience of the
miraculous ſwarmes of Flies, ver. 21, 22, 23, 24. And ver. 25. <hi>Then Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh
called for Moſes and Aaron and ſaid, Go, do Sacrifice unto your God in this Land.</hi>
The offer is ſo niggardly that <hi>Moſes</hi> diſdains to accept of it, cannot ſo much
as hear it without ſuch Indignation as is expreſt ver. 26. <hi>It is not meet to do ſo:
for then we ſhould offer unto the Lord our God that which is an abomination unto the
Egyptians: Lo, can we ſacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes,
and they not ſtone us?</hi> Notwithſtanding all the former Documents of Gods
power and wiſedom in ſtill over-reaching <hi>Pharaohs</hi> skill or Potencie; Yet
the <hi>Caitiffe</hi> out of covetouſneſſe ſeeks to drive his bargain as low as may be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
For when <hi>Moſes</hi> was peremptory to go three dayes journey into the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
to ſacrifice; <hi>Pharaoh</hi> yeilded ſomewhat more, then he had done in the
former <hi>G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ant,</hi> to witt, that they might go into the wilderneſſe: but (as if he
had known neither what to ſay nor what to do) he inſtantly limits his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
ver. 28. <hi>And Pharaoh ſaid, I will let you go that you may ſacrifice unto the
Lord your God in the wilderneſſe: But go not farr away.</hi> And (as if that had been
the leaſt part of his preſent intentions) he adds immediately, and as it were
with the ſame breath, Pray or <hi>Intreat for me.</hi> And ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> did, as it follows,
ver. 29. but with this <hi>Canonical</hi> and peremptorie <hi>Monition [But let Pharaoh
from henceforth deceive no more, in not ſuffering the people to ſacrifice unto the Lord.]</hi>
Upon his fraudulent contempt of this Peremptory <hi>monition</hi> the Lord begins
to deale more ſeverely with him and to proceed unto ſentence, and that a
more dreadful one then had befallen him, if he had not dealt ſo deceitfully,
as he did at this turn alſo; for it follows, ver. 32. <hi>Yet Pharaoh hardened his
heart at this time alſo, and did not let the people go.</hi> Moſes in his next Treatie
repeates the ſumme of his firſt Embaſſage unto him; and preſſeth him, by
thronging new plagues upon him, to come to his tryal, Chap. 9. ver. 1, 2, 3.
<hi>Then the Lord ſaid unto Moſes, Go in unto Pharaoh and tel him, Thus ſaith the Lord
God of the Hebrews, let my people go that they may ſerve me: for if thou refuſe to
let them go, and wilt hold them ſtill; Behold, the hand of the Lord is upon thy cattel,
&amp;c.</hi> This word <hi>Ecce,</hi> as in moſt other places, is here a <hi>ſpecial Character</hi> of the
ſpeedy execution of the Plague that was threatened, and of the remarkable
manner how it was executed, ver. 4. <hi>And the Lord ſhall ſever between the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel
of Iſrael and the cattel of Egypt, and there ſhall nothing dye of all that is the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens
of Iſrael. And the Lord appointed a ſet time ſaying, To morrow the Lord
ſhall do this thing in the Land. And the Lord did that thing on the morrow: and the
cattel of Egypt died; but of the cattel of the children of Iſrael died not one,</hi> ver. 5. 6.
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> experience of the former Plagues fore-told by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
in his own ſight, did perſwade him ſo farr to believe his Prediction of
this, that he ſent into Goſhen to know the truth of that part of it: <hi>And behold
there was not one of the cattel of the Iſraelites dead,</hi> v. 7. And yet as it follows in the
ſame verſe, <hi>The heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>17. All or moſt of the former ſigns were reſpectively rather more noy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
and terrible, then detrimental unto Pharaoh and his People. We do
not read before this time of the death or deſtruction of any uſeful creatures,
beſides of Fiſhes when the waters were turned into bloud. And this calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
was neither ſo grievous nor ſo univerſal, as the murrain of cattel was. It
extended only to that part of the River, or thoſe waters that were nigh to
<hi>Pharaohs</hi> Court: otherwiſe the Magicians or Inchanters could have had no
<pb n="3201" facs="tcp:100044:118"/>
Place to practiſe their skill in. But this murrain of the moſt uſeful creatures,
was very general: Nor would the Magicians have attempted the like, if it
had been apprehended as facible by them; ſeeing both the <hi>Egyptians</hi> and
themſelves ſhould have been greater Loſers by the Practiſe of their own
cunning. But ſeeing this Plague did not infect <hi>Pharaohs</hi> coffers or treaſure
Cities, (which the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were enjoyned to build, or to prepare materials
for their building,) nor yet <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Chariots or Stables: hence haply it is
that he is not ſo much affected with the wonder, as he had been with ſome of
the former. And yet becauſe this wonder did give little or no check unto his
proud ſtubborn thoughts, the Lord inſtantly and without further <hi>Commiſſion</hi>
(as being now in <hi>Proceſſe</hi> of Sentence) commands <hi>Moſes</hi> to bring another
Plague upon the <hi>Egyptians</hi> more terrible &amp; noyſome then any of the reſt had
been, ver. 8. <hi>Then the Lord ſaid unto Moſes and unto Aaron; Take to you hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuls
of the aſhes of the furnace, &amp;c. And they took aſhes of the furnace and ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
Pharaoh; and Moſes ſprinkled it up toward heaven: and it became a boyl break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forth with blains upon man and upon beaſt. And the Magicians could not ſtand
before Moſes, becauſe of the boyles: for the boyl was upon the Magicians and upon
all the Egyptians,</hi> ver. 10 11. Whether <hi>Pharaoh</hi> did reſume or continue his
former Reſolutions without any relentance, the Text is ſilent; but expreſſe
enough to this purpoſe, That the Lord did from this time harden the heart
of Pharaoh after a more extraordinary manner then it had been hardened
before: for ſo the words do run, ver. 12. <hi>And the Lord hardened the heart of Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh,
and he hearkened not unto them, as the Lord had ſpoken unto Moſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what was it that the Lord had ſpoken unto <hi>Moſes?</hi> Or where
did he ſpecially ſpeak to this purpoſe? The place whereto theſe
words <hi>[As the Lord had ſpoken unto Moſes]</hi> do punctually referr, is, as
our Engliſh margin directs us, Exod. 4. 21. <hi>And the Lord ſaid unto Moſes,
when thou goeſt to return into Egypt, See that thou do all thoſe wonders before Phara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oh,
which I have put in thine hand: But I will harden his heart, that he ſhall not let
the people go.</hi> In moſt of the former Treaties between Moſes and Pharaoh;
Or in the relation of the ſucceſſe or effect of his ſpeech or works, this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phonema
or Cloſe comes often in. <hi>[That Pharaoh hearkened not to Moſes and
Aaron as the Lord had ſpoken.]</hi> But in none of them beſides this preſent is it
ſo expreſly added, that <hi>[the Lord did harden the heart of Pharaoh, as he had
ſpoken unto Moſes.]</hi> This different Character of this Cloſe from the reſt,
gives us to underſtand, or intimates at leaſt, <hi>That this plague of blaines was the
firſt of all the plagues in which the Lord did harden the heart of Pharaoh after any
extraordinary manner.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But after what manner did he now harden it? Not by Infuſion of any bad
Qualitie or new unhallowed Reſolutions; but <hi>by giving him up to his own luſts,</hi>
or by leaving him more open and expoſed to the temptations of Sathan then
he had been. From this time and not before, doth That of our Apoſtle,
Rom. 9. 17. <hi>[For this very purpoſe have I made thee ſtand, that I might ſhew my
power in thee:]</hi> Commence, or begin to take place. Now thus to <hi>infatuate
Pharaoh</hi> or ſuffer him to infatuate himſelf after he had ſo often hardened his
own heart and ſlighted Gods forewarnings, was a true <hi>Act of juſtice;</hi> and
withall a Prognoſtick that the juſt Lord was now Purpoſed to deſtroy him.
So the heathens out of their broken Speculations of Divine Providence, have

                  <p>God in all this, deals no otherwiſe with <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> then pharaoh had done
with the poor oppreſſed Iſraelites, immediately after the delivery of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes

before) ſeverely exacts the ſame <hi>Tale</hi> of bricks after he had prohibited
the Task-maſters to afford them any ſtraw, which they performed before
when they had plenty of ſtraw allowed them. The Lord in like manner
requires but the ſame obedience of Pharaoh after he had deprived him of
underſtanding, and of the ſweet influence of his ordinary general Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence;
which he had required of him before, or at the exhibition of the firſt
ſigns or wonders. And this only is it which miniſtred the occaſion or mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                     <hi>Joſephus</hi> hath made
of his humorous wilful diſpoſition: <q>That after he had ſeen and in ſome
meaſure felt three or four ſeveral plagues, he had a kind of itching humour,
or longing deſire to have more variety of experiments in the like kind.</q>
This the diligent reader may with me eaſily obſerve; That upon his ſight
of the firſt ſigns, and experiments of the Plagues which did accompany
them; he demeand himſelf like a proud Phantaſtick Humoriſt, and did many
waies bewray ſuch a temper as it was impoſſible for him to become wiſe,
untill he had abandoned his former diſpoſitions or reſolutions. But after
the Plagues of the Murrain of cattell and of the blaines upon the Inchanters
themſelves; this proud Phantaſtick falls into a Phrenzie and fares like a
diſtracted Bedlam, and raves as if his brains had been blaſted by the fumes or
ſteames of his cauterized heart or ſeared conſcience: Witneſſe thoſe Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
following, Exod. 9. 27. <hi>And Pharaoh ſent and called for Moſes and Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
and ſaid unto them; I have ſinned this time, the Lord is righteous, and I and
my people are wicked. Intreat the Lord (for it is enough) that there be no more
mighty thundrings and bail; and I will let you go, and ye ſhall ſtay no longer.</hi> Now
albeit <hi>Moſes</hi> after he had promiſed him to remove this Plague, did foretell
him that he would not be ſo good as his promiſe, ver. 30. <hi>[But as for thee and
thy ſervants, I know that ye will not yet fear the Lord God:]</hi> Yet, as it followeth
ver. 34. <hi>When he ſaw the rain and the bail and the thunder were ceaſed, he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
yet more and hardened his heart, he and his ſervants.</hi> And again, Chap. 10.
ver. 7. After his ſervants upon the ſight of the Plague of the Locuſts, did
thus boldly intreat him; <hi>[How long ſhall this man be a ſnare unto us? Let the
men go, that they may ſerve the Lord their God: knowſt thou not yet that Egypt is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed?]</hi>
Though he yeild to their requeſt in part, yet he inſtantly faulters,
ver. 8. <hi>And Moſes and Aaron were brought again unto Pharaoh: and he ſaid
unto them, Go, ſerve the Lord your God: but who are they that ſhall go? And Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
ſaid, we will go with our young and with our old, with our ſons and with our
daughters; with our flocks and with our herds will we go: for we muſt hold a feaſt
unto the Lord. And he ſaid unto them, let the Lord be ſo with you, as I will let you
go and your little ones. Look to it, for evil is before you.</hi> Not ſo, <hi>Go now ye that
are men and ſerve the Lord: for that you did deſire: and they were driven out from
Pharaohs preſence.</hi> The like raving <hi>Fitt</hi> or Phrenetical Symptom you may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
in him, ver. 16, 17. <hi>Then Pharaoh called for Moſes and Aaron in haſt, and
he ſaid, I have ſinned againſt the Lord your God and againſt you: Now therefore
forgive I pray thee my ſin only this once, and intreat the Lord your God, that he may
take away from me this death only.</hi> Now though Moſes did remove this
Plague: yet upon his freſh entreatie for <hi>Moſes</hi> to remove another Plague, to
wit, of palpable darkneſſe, he turns unto his vomit again, ver. 24. 25. <hi>And
<pb n="3203" facs="tcp:100044:119"/>
Pharaoh called unto Moſes, and ſaid, Go ye, ſerve the Lord: only let your flocks and
your heards be ſtayed: let your little ones alſo go with you. And Moſes ſaid, thou
muſt give us alſo ſacrifices and burnt offerings, that we may ſacrifice unto the Lord
our God, &amp;c.</hi> And ver. 28. <hi>Pharaoh ſaid unto him, Get thee from me: take
heed to thy ſelf, ſee my face no more: for in that day thou ſeeſt my face, thou ſhalt
dye:</hi> A ſpeech more fooliſh then proud, to come from a man whom the
Lord had ſo much impoveriſhed, and ſo often humbled; and given ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
proof of his Power to bring farre greater Plagues upon him.</p>
                  <p>19. Though his heart had been thus often hardened; yet is it not become
ſo flinty, but that the ſlaughter of his own, and of every Firſt-born Male in
<hi>Egypt,</hi> did make deeper impreſſion upon it, then any of the former Plagues
had done. The mightie <hi>Out-cry</hi> which followed upon this ſad and woful
ſpectacle to be ſeen in every houſe, did ſo farr awake the drowſie ſpirits a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt
the Egyptians, even of ſuch as had no children to mourn for; that
they joyned in Petition with the reſt to have the Iſraelites fairely diſmiſſed:
and were ready to make them a <hi>Golden bridge</hi> for their ſpeedier Paſſage out
of <hi>Egypt.</hi> From this time and not before were the Women and Maides of
<hi>Egypt</hi> willing to beſtow their jewels and ear-rings upon the Iſraelitiſh wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;
that they might wooe their men and children to depart with ſpeed.
Thus then, that which the Lord had indefinitely promiſed unto <hi>Moſes</hi> from
his firſt Inſtructions given unto him, Exod. 3. 21. was not accompliſhed till
this laſt Plague was exhibited. Nor was the like Prediction of hardening
<hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 4. 21. put in execution, before the <hi>Plagues</hi> of the <hi>Murrain</hi> of
Cattel and of <hi>Blains,</hi> Exod. 9. 12.</p>
                  <p>20. But from this <hi>Mollification</hi> of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and of his peoples hearts by the
ſlaughter of the Firſt-born, there did reſult a more ſtrange <hi>Induration</hi> then at
any time before had befallen them. Of all the infatuated reſolutions which
either King or People had adventured upon; the purſuing of the Iſraelites
with ſuch a mighty army or ſtrong hand, after they had fairly intreated them
to depart out of their coaſts, may well to every indifferent Reader ſeem <hi>the
moſt ſtupid.</hi> And ſo the <hi>Author of the Book of Wiſdom</hi> cenſures it, Chap. 19. 3.
<hi>For whileſt they were yet mourning and making lamentation at the graves of the dead,
they added another fooliſh Device, and purſued them as Fugitives whom they had
intreated to be gone.</hi> Yet <hi>Joſephus</hi> a grave and ſagacious Hiſtorian gives the
intelligent Reader good hints, that even this effect or Phrenetical Symptom
of Divine Infatuation, was but ſuch as hath ſeiſed upon worldly wiſe Princes
and Stateſ-men in former Ages; And hereafter may be inflicted upon
more. The greateſt varietie of Miracles or Wonders in any one Age ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced,
is ſcarce ſufficient to make up a perfect <hi>Induction,</hi> to perſwade ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious,
prophane, or wilfull Spirits, of Gods abſolute Power to effect;
or of his Wiſdom, to contrive the like in every kind. Moſt men are prone
by nature to make ſuch Collections, as the ſervants of the King of Syria did:
<hi>Their Gods are Gods of the bils, therefore they were ſtronger then we: but let us
fight againſt them in the plain, and ſurely we ſhall be ſtronger then they, &amp;c.</hi> 1 King.
30. 23. The undoubted Experiments of the forecited ſigns all done in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi>
might well perſwade <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his People, That <hi>The Lord God of the
Hebrews</hi> was more skilful in producing wonders, then the Gods which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians
of <hi>Egypt</hi> ſerved, were; that <hi>Moſes</hi> under him had a greater command
over the wind and water; over the ayre and clouds; over the duſt of the
earth, and over all the hoſt of reaſonleſs creatures; then either the King, the
Princes, or Prieſts of <hi>Egypt</hi> could ever procure from their Gods; a more So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign
Authority over Flies, then Baal-zebub had. All this being granted
<pb n="3204" facs="tcp:100044:120"/>
they might notwithſtanding thus <hi>Reaſon</hi> in their hearts. <q>Who knows
whether all this power was given unto <hi>Moſes</hi> to be exerciſed onely within
the <hi>Meridian, or Climes of Egypt:</hi> or whether his <hi>Commiſſion</hi> might extend
over <hi>Paleſtina</hi> and <hi>Madian?</hi>
                     </q> The <hi>Egyptians</hi> at leaſt preſumed that <hi>The

The Extract or <hi>Quinteſſence</hi> of which <hi>Aphoriſm,</hi> is This; <q>That the

manner he had done <hi>Pharaohs</hi> and the <hi>Egyptians;</hi> if at any time they ſhould
become as obſtinate as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his People had been; or harden their

of Gods forewarnings; ſpecially, theſe being ſeconded by ſigns and
Wonders no leſſe admirable, then <hi>Moſes</hi> had ſhewed in <hi>Egypt.</hi>

harden their own hearts after a ſtranger manner and for a longer ſpace then
the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were hardened, upon ſuppoſal or diſcovery of the like (though
leſſe) pride of heart, obſtinacy or contempt of Gods Embaſſadors; could
be no prejudice to Gods Oath to <hi>Abraham;</hi> no impeachment of Promiſed
Loving-kindneſſe unto <hi>David,</hi> but rather a <hi>Conſtat</hi> to all the World, <hi>That
the God of Abraham was no accepter of Perſons: but that in every nation, who fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth

which the former had begun, The Lord ſaid, <hi>I have ſurely ſeen the affliction of
of my people which are in Egypt, and have heard their cry, by reaſon of their Taſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters:
for I know their ſorrows; and I am come down to deliver them out of the
hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of the Land, unto a good Land and
a large, unto a land flowing with milk and honey,</hi> Exod. 3. 7, 8. The Seed of
<hi>Abraham</hi> was no leſſe grievouſly oppreſſed by the <hi>Romanes;</hi> and by <hi>Herod</hi> the
Great their Deputy. And (which was worſt of all) their own Governours
layd heavy burdens of conſcience upon them: Many of them were tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in body, if not in ſoule, by the Divel. The depth as well of the Peoples
as of the Governours miſery was, That they did not perceive or rightly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend
the danger of their diſeaſe. In commiſeration of all theſe and other
parts of their affliction, <hi>The ſame Lord God</hi> which had appeared to <hi>Moſes</hi> in
the Buſh, and teſtifyed that he was come down to ſee the affliction of the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi>
under <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> did now the ſecond time deſcend from heaven to earth
to viſit the affliction of his people under the <hi>Romanes</hi> and their Governors;
ſhewing his Commiſſion to this purpoſe by many ſigns and Wonders, much
greater and more gracious then <hi>Moſes</hi> had wrought in <hi>Egypt;</hi> moſt of them
reſpectively exhibited in the ſight of the <hi>Phariſees, Prieſts, and Elders</hi> and of
all the people, but with worſe ſucceſſe in reſpect of them, for whoſe good
they were purpoſely and eſpecially wrought, then <hi>Moſes</hi> his miracles had
found in <hi>Egypt.</hi> The <hi>Egyptians</hi> ('tis true) did not hearken unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor
hold his miracles in that eſteem which they deſerved: but to perſecute, to
ſtone, or otherwiſe to ſlay or murther <hi>Moſes,</hi> we do not read of any attempt
made by them, untill after he had departed with Gods People out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
Whereas the Scribes and Phariſees with the Prieſts and Elders upon the
more frequent ſight of our Saviours Miracles did not only harden their own
hearts, but wrought the people (otherwiſe well inclined unto his Doctrine)
to ſuch an hardneſſe of heart, that they perſecuted <hi>The God,</hi> or <hi>Great Angel
of the Covenant,</hi> who had appeared to <hi>Moſes</hi> in Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> unto a bloudy
ignominious death: and (which doth aggravate the ſin) ſought the releaſe

perſecuted (as farr as in them lay) the Lord God of their Fathers after his
departure out of this World, by procuring a watch or guard to be ſet about
his grave, ſeeking thereby to ſtop his paſſage, which he had foretold, from
death to life. But he in the mean time gives evident Proof, that he had

greater Power and more ſoveraign command over the earth, over the rocks &amp;
grave it ſelf, then <hi>Moſes</hi> had over the waters of <hi>Egypt</hi> or the Red Sea, which
<hi>Moſes</hi> (by vertue of his power whoſe Embaſſador he was) did command
to ſwallow up the <hi>Egyptians</hi> alive. <hi>This ſecond Moſes</hi> or Great Prophet like
unto him, after his death commands the rocks to cleave aſunder, and the
earth and grave to give up their dead. No marvel if, after the <hi>Iews</hi> had thus
wilfully and deſperately hardened their own hearts, the Lord God of their
Fathers have hardened their hearts after a ſtranger manner then he did the
hearts of Pharaoh and his People, and for a longer ſpace; even to this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

of his <hi>Secretarie,</hi> upon a Prenotion or Fame (which he had heard or lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
God knows from whom, or by what means) that there ſhould about

ſtood then,</hi> without dangerous prejudice to the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> Upon the
like jealouſie occaſioned by more then a publick Fame, an Authentick Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notion,
That there ſhould about the latter end of <hi>Herods</hi> raign, ariſe <hi>A Star
in Jacob, a true King of the Jews:</hi> the bloodie Tyrant cauſed all the Males
of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Benjamin</hi> about <hi>Bethlehem</hi> which were under two years, to be
cruelly murthered; and yet left the <hi>true King of the Jews, the Heir of David,
the Flower of Jeſſe, and Hope of Iſrael,</hi> untouched.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second Circumſtance,</hi> or remarkable ſimilitude between <hi>Jeſus</hi> and
<hi>Moſes,</hi> was this: <hi>Moſes</hi> after the firſt cruel <hi>Pharaohs</hi> death, was commanded
<pb n="3208" facs="tcp:100044:122"/>
by God to return into <hi>Egypt</hi> his native ſoil, upon aſſurance given him that

<hi>Herod</hi> and his Complices.<note place="margin">Mat. 2. 20.</note> But my aim in this place (of which I hope I have

then did he erre or fail in his <hi>Collections? Firſt,</hi> in that he preſumed the curſe
derived from their Father <hi>Cham,</hi> ſhould be perpetually upon the <hi>Egyptians:
Secondly,</hi> that the bleſſing derived from <hi>Sem</hi> and <hi>Abraham</hi> unto their ſeed,
ſhould be abſolutely everlaſting. Our <hi>Apoſtle St. Paul</hi> partly by Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,

to continue for a longer time, then that which had befallen the Seed of <hi>Cham</hi>

with the recalling of the Jews, whoſe Reſtauration (it is Probable) ſhall
be wrought or occaſioned by the <hi>Infatuation</hi> or Obduration of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi>
which, through their ingratitude and contempt, is likely to become more

both a <hi>Principle</hi> and a <hi>Concluſion)</hi> the Liſts of my Inquirie into it at this

1.<note place="margin">Two Inquiries.</note> 
                     <hi>From what Premiſſes it is gathered.</hi> And 2. <hi>To what End it is referred; Or,
To what Vſe or purpoſe in the Apostles Intent it is ſpecially applyable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Premiſſes</hi> whence it is gathered firſt well <hi>ſounded,</hi> will rectifie our aime
or Level at the <hi>Scope</hi> whereto it is directed: And the <hi>End</hi> or ſcope being
known, will eaſily impart the right <hi>Vſe or Application.</hi> Amongſt many <hi>Vſes</hi>
whereto theſe words may ſerve, it is not the leaſt, That their juſt <hi>Extent</hi>
once rightly taken will ſerve as a juſt meaſure or ſcantling to notifie and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
the contents of many <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in this Chapter, which have been as
much perverted as any places in all <hi>St. Pauls Epiſtles;</hi> becauſe they have
been the common <hi>Themes</hi> of every illiterate vocaliſt or rural Scholar.</p>
                  <p>2. It is (I take it) agreed upon by all, (at leaſt it will be denyed by none)
that the principal <hi>End</hi> of this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> is, to eſtabliſh theſe <hi>Romanes,</hi> (whether
<hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles</hi> by Progenie) in that <hi>Faith</hi> wherein they had been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted.
And by the <hi>Line</hi> or Level which is directed to this <hi>End,</hi> muſt the
Argument of this preſent <hi>Chapter</hi> (as of all the reſt) be ſquared. The <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials</hi>
here handled differ ſomewhat from the former; but <hi>Modus conſideran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di;</hi>
their Reference or Aſpect to the propoſed <hi>End,</hi> is the ſame. What the
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> in this place here inſerts, either concerning the <hi>hardening of Pharaoh,</hi>
the <hi>Reprobation of the Modern Iewes,</hi> or free <hi>Election</hi> of their Fathers, is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely
inſerted for under-propping or fortifying his <hi>Former Aſſertion; [That
Iuſtification or Salvation muſt be ſought by Faith only without Works.]</hi> To per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade
the truth of this our <hi>Aſſertion,</hi> no particular Allegations of Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
or reaſons can ſo much avail with an ingenuous Auditor, as his own di-diligent
<pb n="3211" facs="tcp:100044:123"/>
Peruſal of the 10. and 11. <hi>Chapters; in which,</hi> The Reſumption
of his former Argument, is, to cleare-ſighted men more evident, then
the Continuance of it, is <hi>in this:</hi> And with his former Doctrine, in thoſe
<hi>two Chapters</hi> reſumed, he intermingles powerful admonitions to the <hi>Gentiles</hi>
to make their <hi>Election Sure;</hi> unto which purpoſe the <hi>Original and manner
of the Iewes Rejection,</hi> is in this <hi>Chapter</hi> premiſed. And He that ſhall
pleaſe in his more retired thoughts, unpartially to ſurvey the <hi>Connexion</hi>
which the 10. and 11. <hi>Chapters</hi> with the laſt part of this 9, have with the
former, ſpecially with the 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8; The ſtream or Current
of the Diſcourſe will evidently bewray it ſelfe to be the ſame: howſoever
it may ſeeme (a litle before and after <hi>This 16, Verſe</hi>) to run a cloſe way,
or under ground; yet ſo, as the opening of it is apparent, verſe 30. <hi>What
ſhall we ſay then? That the Gentiles which followed not after righteouſneſſe
have attained to righteouſneſſe: But Iſrael hath not attained to righteouſneſſe,
becauſe they ſought it not by faith, but as it were by the workes of the Law.
Verſe</hi> 32.</p>
                  <p>3. The faireſt <hi>Connexion</hi> of this 9. <hi>Chapter</hi> with the former, in my
opinion, is This: <q>The <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> having in the later end of the former
Chapter confidently avouched the <hi>Infallible Aſſurance</hi> of their hopes,
which renouncing <hi>Workes</hi> ſeek <hi>Salvation only by Faith in Chriſt;</hi> and his
heart having been dilated with joy and exultation of ſpirit in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their happineſſe, is, in the rebound, more deeply touched with
ſorrow for the <hi>Iewes</hi> his countrey-men and kinsfolk according to the fleſh:
The lamentable Iſſue of whoſe excellent Prerogatives, and ſtrange miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
of their extraordinary paines and zealous care in obſerving the Law,
might well have danted the late converted <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to whom he writes;
and in mens eſteem, much impaired the ſtrength of all former aſſurances
which he had given them; unleſſe he had further manifeſted the <hi>true Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
of the Fall</hi> or Rejection of Gods antient people. This unfained ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
for their miſerie is ſo much the greater, (as every good mans in like
caſe would be:) by how much their <hi>Meanes</hi> of well doeing had been
the <hi>better;</hi> their <hi>Approach</hi> to true happineſſe, <hi>nearer;</hi> and their <hi>Intereſt</hi> in
Gods promiſes more <hi>peculiar</hi> then other mens were.</q> It litle moves us
to ſee a lazy unthrift come to be a begger: But to ſee a man extraordinarily
induſtrious in his <hi>Calling,</hi> not to thrive, or utterly to overthrow himſelf
and his poſterity, by ſome one wilfull humour, is grief to every other man
that can take paines for his living. <hi>This Original</hi> of our <hi>Apoſtles</hi> ſorrow is
expreſſely intimated by himſelf, <hi>Chap. 10. Ver.</hi> 1, 2.</p>
                  <p>Brethren, my hearts deſire and prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they might
be ſaved: for I bear them record, that they have a zeal of God, but not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
to knowledge. <hi>And in the</hi> 11. Chapter. <hi>he tels us</hi> Gentiles, (<hi>what</hi> Moſes
<hi>before had told theſe</hi> Iewes;) <hi>That whenſoever they ſhould turn again
to the God of their fathers, they were to have</hi> Precedencie <hi>of all other
people in the world, in his Everlaſting and unchangable Love.</hi> I ſay then;
Have they ſtumbled that they ſhould fall? God forbid. But rather through their
Fall, ſalvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealouſie. Now
if the Fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminiſhing of them, the
riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fulneſs? <hi>ver. 11. 12. And again ver.</hi>
28, 29. Concerning the Goſpel, they are Enemies, for your ſake: but as touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Election, they are beloved for the fathers ſake, for the gifts and calling
of God are without repentance. <hi>And would it not greive any zealous ſoul
that loves the memorie of his fathers? to ſee them ſo farre eſtranged from
<pb n="3212" facs="tcp:100044:124"/>
their God, who is not altogether eſtranged from them, but alwayes ready
when</hi> theſe Prodigals ſhall returne <hi>unto him, to embrace them as his dear
Sons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe are <hi>Points</hi> whoſe contemplation in our Apoſtle was deeper then our
ſhallow witts can rightly <hi>ſound;</hi> and did caſt him out of ſuch an <hi>Ecſtaſie</hi> of joy
into ſuch a ſuddain <hi>Trance</hi> of ſorrow, that he had no leaſure to expreſſe the
<hi>Cauſes</hi> of it in the beginning of this ninth Chapter, but is fain to reſerve it to
the beginning of the tenth. The very depth of ſorrow had ſwallowed up
the very ſtream or current of his diſcourſe, and cauſeth him to begin thus ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly:
<q>
                        <hi>I ſay the truth in Christ, I lye not, my conſcience alſo hearing me witneſs
in the Holy Ghoſt, that I have great heavineſſe, and continual ſorrow in my heart:
For I could wiſh that my ſelf were accurſed from Chriſt, for my Brethren my kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
according to the fleſh: who are Iſraelites; to whom pertaineth the Adoption
&amp; the Glory, and the Covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the Service of
God, and the promiſes; whoſe are the Fathers, and of whom as concerning the
Fleſh, CHRIST came, who is over all, GOD, bleſſed for ever, Amen. </hi>
                     </q> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
his ſorrow as though he had ſtill prayed for them whileſt he ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed.</p>
                  <p>If it be further demanded what <hi>Peculiar occaſion</hi> he had to be overtaken
with theſe ſuddain Pangs of ſorrow, rather in <hi>this place</hi> (the beginning of this
ninth Chapter) then any other; the <hi>Special occaſion,</hi> as I intimated before,
was, the preſent Opportunitie or neceſſitie of anſwering an <hi>Exception,</hi> which
from the Rejection of theſe <hi>Iews,</hi> might have been taken againſt thoſe confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<hi>Aſſertions</hi> wherewith He had concluded the former. And being to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomize
their wounds, for others inſtruction, unto the quick; the ſight of
their grievouſneſſe could not but make his heart to bleed.</p>
                  <p>4. Againſt his former <hi>Aſſertions</hi> (he ſaw) the <hi>Gentile</hi> or <hi>Iew</hi> late converted
would be ready <hi>thus to object,</hi> 
                     <q>If <hi>they</hi> of whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> according to the fleſh
came; If <hi>They</hi> for whoſe miſcarriage <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the dayes of his fleſh was
more ſorrowfull then thou canſt be: yet <hi>They,</hi> notwithſtanding all theſe
<hi>Prerogatives</hi> and peculiar <hi>Intereſts</hi> in Gods Promiſes, are fallen away and
utterly ſeparated from God:</q> Where is the <hi>Infallibilitie of our aſſurance.</hi>
What is the ground of thy boaſting? <q>that <hi>Neither death, nor life, nor things
preſent, nor things to come, nor Angels, nor Principalities, nor Powers, nor height,
nor depth, nor any other creature ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God
which is in Christ Jeſus our Lord?</hi> Rom. 8. 38, 39. Have we any warrant
thus to perſwade our ſelves beſides <hi>Gods Word?</hi> any better Aſſurance
then his <hi>Promiſe?</hi> and ſeeing theſe <hi>Jews</hi> thy Country-men, as thou often
inculcates, had <hi>both Theſe</hi> in as ample manner and Form, as we can expect: if
<hi>neither</hi> took effect in <hi>Them,</hi> why may not <hi>Both</hi> want their effects in <hi>us?</hi>
                     </q> With
this <hi>Objection</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> (if we duly mark the <hi>Cloſure</hi> of his proteſted ſorrow
for the <hi>Jews</hi> Fall) directly meets, ver. 6. <hi>Not as though the word of God had
taken none effect.</hi> It was in his eye when he fell into the former Trance; out
of which awaked, he falls in hand with it afreſh again.</p>
                  <p>5. The more often and more ſeriouſly we read <hi>the Doctrinal Part of this
Epiſtle to the Romanes,</hi> or of thoſe other to the <hi>Galatians</hi> and the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> the
juſter occaſion we ſhall have alwaies to admire our <hi>Apoſtles</hi> skill, as well in
<hi>right applying</hi> the <hi>Typical Praenotions or Aenigmatical Portendments of the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament
to the Events in the New,</hi> as alſo in <hi>making uſe</hi> of whatſoever by the
<hi>Iews,</hi> or any on their behalf, could be <hi>Objected,</hi> for eſtabliſhing the truth
which he maintained againſt them. For Inſtance at this time, take only <hi>The
manner of his Retorting the former Objection;</hi> wherein this whole Chapter, and
<pb n="3213" facs="tcp:100044:124"/>
the other Two following are wholly ſpent. <hi>The manner is thus:</hi> 
                     <q>It is true;
The <hi>Iews</hi> my kinſmen, who had greater <hi>Intereſt</hi> in Gods Love and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
then any people beſides them hitherto have had; as great as any
after them can expect, are become Caſt-awaies.</q> But ſpend your thoughts
not ſo much in wondering at this, as in Conſidering, that the only Cauſe of
<q>their Fall, was no other, then <hi>Ignorance of this Doctrine</hi> which I now teach
being formerly taught by the Law and the Prophets. Be ye not therefore
Partakers with them in this their Error: and ſo Gods Promiſes ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly
take effect in you;</q> for he hath ordained that their Fall ſhall be
the means of your eſtabliſhment.</p>
                  <p>The Ignorance of theſe his Country-men was not <hi>Ignorantia purae negatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis;</hi>
but <hi>pravae diſpoſitionis,</hi> an Ignorance rooted in <hi>Carnal Pride,</hi> the offſpring
of another Pernicious Error. They thought it ſufficient to ſalvation, that
they were <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and the ſeed of <hi>Abraham:</hi> herein moſt groſly ignorant
and more inexcuſable then the Heathen; ſeeing the Scripture had plainly
given them to underſtand, that <hi>They are not all Iſrael, that are of Iſrael, neither all
Children that are of the ſeed of Abraham;</hi> for <hi>Abraham</hi> had <hi>Iſhmael</hi> and many
other children beſides <hi>Iſaac:</hi> and yet the Lord had ſaid to <hi>Abraham, In Iſaac
ſhall thy ſeed be called.</hi> The <hi>Myſtical or Evangelical ſenſe</hi> of which words in
our Apoſtles Expoſition ver. 8. is this, <hi>They which are the children of the fleſh,
theſe are not the children of God: but the children of the Promiſe are accounted
for</hi> The Seed. The true and Orthodoxal Conſtruction of this <hi>Apostolical De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration</hi>
(upon <hi>Moſes's</hi> words) if we apply it unto the <hi>Romanes to whom,</hi> or
unto our <hi>ſelves for whoſe good,</hi> he wrote it, and referr it to the End by him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
and ſuppoſed throughout this whole Diſcourſe is as much as if he
had ſaid, <q>Stand not ye upon the Prerogatives of the fleſh, as my rejected
Country-men have done, but betake your ſelves wholly to Gods Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes
as Abraham did, and ye ſhall undoubtedly remain the choſen ſeed of
Abraham and Children of God.</q> His Aſſertion (or Aſſurance) is the ſame
in effect with that of St<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> John Chapt. 1. ver. 12, 13. <hi>As many as received him,
to them he gave power to be the ſons of God, even to them that believe on his name:
which were born, not of bloud, nor of the will of the fleſh, but of God.</hi> Nor doth our
Apoſtle either here or in any other part of his writings once intimate any
other Cauſe of theſe <hi>Jews Rejection,</hi> beſides that hereditary diſeaſe, whereof
the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> foreſaw their beſt teachers dangerouſly ſick, and for whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
he preſcribes a wary dyet, whileſt he offers the medicine of baptiſm
unto them. <hi>When he ſaw many of the Phariſees and Sadduces come to his Baptiſm,
he ſaid unto them; O Generation of Vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the
wrath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>o come? Bring forth therefore fruits meet for Repentance, and think not to
ſay within you ſelves, We have Abraham for our Father: for</hi> I <hi>ſay unto you that God
is able of theſe ſtones to Raiſe up Children unto Abraham, Mat.</hi> 3. 7, 8, 9. Had
they ſtedfaſtly relyed upon Gods Power manifeſted in the miraculous birth
of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and the mightie increaſe of his Poſteritie, as they did upon <hi>this glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Title</hi> of being <hi>Abrahams and Iſaacs ſeed,</hi> they might have been ſons not of
<hi>Abraham</hi> only but of <hi>God.</hi> And no place of Scripture, in my obſervation,
warrants us to think, that they were excluded by any <hi>Immutable Decree</hi> or <hi>irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocable
Act</hi> of Omnipotencie from thus relying on Gods Power, or from fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
Abrahams foot-ſteps. Let us not then, I beſeech you, in a matter of
ſo great Coſequence <hi>Preſume to understand above that which is written,</hi> or to
make a further <hi>Reſolution</hi> of mens <hi>Reprobation,</hi> then our Apoſtle hath done.
And the <hi>Firſt and only Cauſe</hi> into which he reſolves the <hi>Rejection</hi> of theſe <hi>Jews,</hi>
as from the <hi>Concluſion</hi> of this diſcourſe, ver. 32. is apparent, is, <hi>That they
<pb n="3214" facs="tcp:100044:125"/>
ſought ſalvation not by Faith but by works;</hi> not by relyance on Gods Power
or Promiſes, but by Confidence in theſe Carnal Prerogatives.</p>
                  <p>6. As it is dangerous to aſſign any Cauſe of <hi>Reprobation</hi> without warrant
of Scripture, ſo is it a Prepoſterous preſumption to pronounce their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<hi>Reprobated</hi> or <hi>accurſed,</hi> whom the Scripture hath proclaimed for <hi>Bleſſed.</hi>
Yet ſome in our times (unleſſe my memory fail me) have ranked <hi>Iſmael</hi>
amongſt the <hi>Reprobates;</hi> when as <hi>Moſes</hi> hath regiſtred the Grant of <hi>Abrahams</hi>
Petition for him,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>As for Iſhmael I have heard thee, Behold</hi> I <hi>have bleſſed him.</hi>
Now <hi>Abraham</hi> doubtleſſe did pray in Faith; and his Faith queſtionleſs did
as well reſpect the Kingdom of God and his righteouſneſſe, as the bleſſings
of this Life. Yea his Prayer for him was conceived in that very form,
which (as I have learned from ſome too rigid in the doctrine of reprobation) is
the true Character of Gods Elect and Choſen. And for juſtifying their ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of this uſe of <hi>the Phraſe</hi> in other places of Scripture, they alledge
this Petition of Abraham,<note place="margin">Gen. 17. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>O that Iſhmael might live before thee:</hi> which is, as
if he had ſaid, <q>O that thou wouldeſt take <hi>Iſhmael</hi> to be thy ſervant, and
admit him into thy favour.</q> Juſt <hi>Abraham</hi> prayes for, and the Almightie
grants, <hi>I ſhmaels</hi> admiſſion into that preſence of God, from which David de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires
he might not be caſt out. Pſal. 51. 11.</p>
                  <p>7. But whatſoever became of <hi>Iſhmael:</hi> Our Apoſtle foreſaw the proud
<hi>Jew</hi> would <hi>Except</hi> againſt <hi>this inſtance</hi> (as they did againſt the like of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours.
John 8. 41. We <hi>are not born of fornication;</hi>) <q>We are Abrahams ſons,
not by the Bondwoman, but by Sarah; and why then <hi>Twit'ſt</hi> thou us with
<hi>Iſhmael?</hi>
                     </q> 
                     <hi>His Rejoynder</hi> followeth in the next words, to this effect: <q>
                        <hi>Eſau</hi> was
<hi>Iſaacs</hi> Son by <hi>Rebecca,</hi> conceived at the ſame time, and born before your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Jacob,</hi> who notwithſtanding got the bleſſing of Birthright from him.</q>
Was <hi>Eſau</hi> therefore an accurſed Reprobate? God knowes; I cannot tell:
The bounds of my <hi>preſent enquirie</hi> is, to what End or Uſe <hi>this Inſtance</hi> is
brought by our <hi>Apoſtle;</hi> and how it inferrs the <hi>Concluſion</hi> here in this 16.
verſe. Now from our <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Principal Intent or Scope we can gather no
other pertinent Uſe of his Inſtances (in <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi>) ſave only <hi>this;</hi> That
God in his allſeeing wiſdom did by theſe <hi>Types</hi> myſtically forewarn their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie,
(as <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> his Meſſenger, and his <hi>Son our Lord and Saviour</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
and literally afterwards did) not to ſtand on their Genealogie, their
Birthright, or other Prerogatives, wherein fleſh and bloud, <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed
above all others, were apt to boaſt; but wholly to betake <hi>themſelves to his
Promiſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Circumſtances which evince and juſtifie <hi>this Obſervation,</hi> are remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably
contained in the <hi>holy Stories,</hi> whereto our <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> as his manner is,
briefly and <hi>in Tranſcurſu</hi> referrs us; that we might ſee the <hi>Truth</hi> which he
taught, with our <hi>own</hi> eyes, and <hi>Rear our Faith</hi> upon the ſame Foundations
from which his faith had been raiſed. <hi>Abraham,</hi> after God had promiſed
him <hi>[I will make of thee a mightie Nation: In thy ſeed ſhall all the Nations
of the Earth be bleſſed]</hi> did yet ſuſpect leſt all this might be fulfilled in his heir
by Adoption, though by Birth a ſtranger, and by condition a ſervant;
untill the Lord made a fuller Declaration of his meaning. Gen. 15. 4.
<hi>This. (Eliezer) ſhall not be thine heir, but he that ſhall come forth of thine
owne bowels, he ſhall be thine heir.</hi> After all this, <hi>Sarah</hi> complains, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
now the Lord hath reſtrained me from bearing.</hi> And <hi>Abraham,</hi> hearkening
to her counſel, which this diſtruſt had ſuggeſted, took <hi>Hagar</hi> her maid to
wife, hopeing the former promiſe might be accompliſhed in her Off-ſpring,
as it is Gen. 16. <hi>Abraham</hi> (to ſpeak with Reverence of his Infirmitie) did
<pb n="3215" facs="tcp:100044:125"/>
herein miſtake the Tenour of Gods promiſe, as he had done once before:
And to rectifie his error, God further explicates his meaning in promiſing
<hi>Iſaac.</hi> Gen. 17. 15. &amp;c. Now, that which our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> would have us ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to obſerve, is, That the Almighty in thus croſſing righteous <hi>Abrahams</hi>
Will and purpoſe, firſt to make <hi>Eliezer,</hi> then <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> his heir; did hereby
give poſteritie to underſtand, They were not to relye on the Will of man
or any Inventions of fleſh and blood for attaining the bleſſing, but meerly
on <hi>His Will</hi> revealed, who is able and willing to effect his promiſe, though
by meanes more miraculous then was <hi>Iſaacs</hi> birth, or (to uſe S. <hi>Iohn Baptiſts</hi>
words) though it were by raiſing up children out of ſtones to <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>8. <hi>Iſaac</hi> alſo had a greater longing to beſtow his birth-right upon <hi>Eſau</hi>
his eldeſt ſon, then to eat of his Veniſon: for he ſent him out to catch it,
to the end he might bleſſe him with greater chearfulneſſe: And <hi>Eſau</hi> was
more forward to gratifie his old fathers deſire, then was his brother <hi>Jacob.</hi>
Yet, that poſterity might alwaies bear in memory, the bleſſing did neither
depend on <hi>Iſaacs Willingneſſe to beſtow it,</hi> nor on <hi>Eſau's Running to deſerve it
of his father,</hi> but wholly and meerely on Gods purpoſe; <hi>Rebecca,</hi> to whom
his purpoſe was long before made known, findes a meanes to derive the
<hi>Birth-right</hi> to her Younger ſon, while the Elder was rangeing abroad to
compaſſe it. It ſeemes, ſhe had not imparted the <hi>Oracle</hi> to old <hi>Iſaac</hi> before;
Or He perhaps had forgotten it, untill the Event did call the meaning of it
to his memory: And this perchance may be the reaſon, why he is ſo pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
of Circumvention by his wife, as now perceiving it to be the Lords do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
However, the Lord before the children were born; before they had
done either good or evill, had told <hi>Rebecca</hi> their mother, That the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which ſhould ſpring from <hi>the Elder ſhould</hi> be the weaker, and <hi>ſerve</hi> the
off-ſpring of <hi>the Younger:</hi> And from this intimation ſhe wiſely gathered,
that the Birth-right or bleſſing was, according to the Tenour of Gods <hi>Free
Donation,</hi> to be convaied unto the Younger. Had not this purpoſe of the
Almightie been revealed before the children had been born, before either
father or mother could have had any reaſon to affect the one more then the
other; <hi>Iacobs</hi> poſterity (as they have been too fooliſh and arrogant) would
have baoſted, That either their father <hi>Iacob,</hi> or his mother <hi>Rebecca</hi> which
loved him more then his brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> had better obſerved thoſe rites and
cuſtomes wherein they placed righteouſneſſe, then <hi>Iſaac</hi> or <hi>Eſau</hi> had done;
and that God upon theſe motives had beſtowed the birth-right or bleſſing
upon <hi>Jacob</hi> before <hi>Eſau.</hi> And to no other Purpoſe, for ought I can by <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alogie
of Scripture</hi> conceive, ſave only to Prevent this pride and hypocriſie
in the <hi>Iew,</hi> or to leave it without excuſe, doth our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> note that Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of the Story, <hi>before they were borne, or had done good or evill.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. But as this takes away the former <hi>Reply</hi> or Apologie: ſo it breeds
<hi>a new Objection:</hi> for did not God by his Law allot the Firſt-born a double
Portion, and give him in every reſpect the Preeminence of his brethren?</p>
                  <p>If this Law were juſt and right, were it not unrighteouſneſſe in God to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave
<hi>Eſau</hi> of his Birth-right or other Prerogative before he had offended
the Law or the Lawgiver, <hi>before he had done good or evil?</hi> No; He beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a greater Inheritance upon <hi>Eſau,</hi> then either his Father <hi>Iſaac</hi> or his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<hi>Jacob</hi> lived poſſeſſed of, greater then by any cuſtomary Lawes of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
he could lay claim unto. And the Firſt-born among the ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi>
were bound to bleſſe him for his Goodneſſe in allowing them a <hi>double Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
in bleſſings temporal: But he had forewarned them as well by his own
<hi>practiſe in Jacobs</hi> Caſe, as by his <hi>Inſtructions given to Moſes,</hi> not to ſeek his
<pb n="3216" facs="tcp:100044:126"/>
ſpecial Goodneſs by <hi>Plea of Law</hi> or by cuſtom of Nations; not to urge <hi>his
own Law</hi> concerning Bleſſings temporal, to Over-rule his Will in beſtowing
Bleſſings Spiritual. All then which our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> meant in his <hi>Reply</hi> to this <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
[Is there unrighteouſneſſe with God?]</hi> is no more in effect, then <hi>This:</hi>
                     <q>God hath reſerved it as an <hi>Eternal Prerogative</hi> to himſelf, <hi>To have mercy on
whom he will have mercy; and to have compaſſion on whom he will have compaſſion,</hi>
not on them whom the preſent ſons of <hi>Jacob</hi> think worthyeſt of mercy and
compaſſion, becauſe they are <hi>Abrahams ſeed,</hi> or becauſe they being Gentiles,
love their Nation, and build them Synagogues.</q> 
                     <hi>Cerah</hi> and <hi>Dathan</hi> with
their <hi>Complices,</hi> becauſe ſome of theſe men deſcended from <hi>Levi,</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> and
<hi>Aaron</hi> did, others from <hi>Reuben Jacobs</hi> eldeſt ſon, thought themſelves men as
holy and juſt, at leaſt as capable of Gods Favour and Graces as <hi>Moſes</hi> was;
But Gods judgment of them was farre otherwiſe. And when man hath
done what he liſt, or what he can, God will uſe his own judgment and not
his, in the diſpoſing of mercy and judgment; for he <hi>worketh all things accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the counſel of his Will;</hi> (Whatſoever the devices of mans heart be) <hi>That
muſt ſtand.</hi> So then, <hi>it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of
God that ſheweth mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>10. What is not <hi>of him that willeth?</hi> what is not of <hi>him that runneth?</hi>
Neither <hi>Election,</hi> nor <hi>Salvation,</hi> nor any Spiritual <hi>Grace</hi> thereto tending. The
Propoſition is <hi>Vniverſally Negative;</hi> neither <hi>Firſt Plantation,</hi> nor <hi>Increaſe;</hi>
neither the <hi>Beginning, Middle,</hi> or <hi>Ending,</hi> nor any other part of any Spiritual
bleſſing is in the Power of Man: All and every Parts is from God alone that
ſheweth mercy.</p>
                  <p>And ſo I come to the ſecond Inquirie,<note place="margin">The ſecond En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quirie.</note> 
                     <hi>To what end or purpoſe this univerſal
Aſſertion is referred;</hi> The diſcuſſion whereof will juſtifie my interpretation
of former Paſſages: For ſurely our Apoſtle intended no more in the <hi>Premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi>
then is contained in the main <hi>Concluſion, Non eſt volentis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Is it then to no purpoſe, what End the man, as yet unregenerate, Propoſe
to his Will; whether good or bad? Or after the End propoſed, skils it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
what choiſe he make of Meanes? Or after choiſe of meanes, no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
how he proſecute them, whether careleſly and ſlothfully, or with dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and alacritie?<note place="margin">See Chap. 32. and Fol. 3143. 2. Note</note> Suppoſe we were to preach to a Congregation of which

<hi>Meanes</hi> for attaining this <hi>Aſſurance;</hi> ſhould we from this Doctrine tell them?
all were one in reſpect of their Converſion or Regeneration, whether they
confeſſed one God or no; whether they ſware by His <hi>Name</hi> in Truth
and judgement, or uſe it raſhly, and vainly; whether they prophane the
Sabbaths, or religiouſly obſerve them; whether they run to ſuſpicious
houſes, or repaire to the Temple? whether they be willing to hear a laſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious
ſong or a Sermon; Common talk, or <hi>Common Prayers</hi> upon Feſtival or
ſolemn dayes? Or doth the undoubted truth of this Doctrine, to witt,
<hi>[Jacob was elected before he had done good or evill]</hi> ſufficiently warrant us to
make <hi>this Vſe</hi> of it to an <hi>unregenerate Audience?</hi> 
                     <q>Seek ye neither to do good
nor evil till ye be elected; for do ye what ye can, if <hi>Gods Will</hi> be to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert

Miniſter of God that underſtands himſelf, but would be more affraid of <hi>theſe
Conſequences,</hi> then <hi>Moſes</hi> was of his <hi>Rod</hi> when it was turned into a ſerpent.
And yet unleſſe <hi>theſe Inferences</hi> be true, Every <hi>Will,</hi> every <hi>Purpoſe</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of man, is not Excluded by the former <hi>Vniverſal Negative</hi> from being
<pb n="3217" facs="tcp:100044:126"/>
availeable <hi>as Meanes ordinarily neceſſary,</hi> but only from being <hi>Meritorious
Cauſes of Regeneration,</hi> or Legall Titles to Election. <hi>Some Will,</hi> and <hi>ſome
kind of endeavours</hi> are in their kind as effectual, as others are idle and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent,
or demeritorious of Gods Grace to convert us.</p>
                  <p>11. If we conſider (in heart) that the principal and laſt <hi>End</hi> of our <hi>Apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi>
endleſs Pilgrimages and indefatigable labours in the Goſpel, was to gain
multitudes of ſoules unto Chriſt; that the <hi>meanes</hi> ſubordinate to this End,
was to encourage all without exception to come, and to ſhew them the way
(as he doth in this <hi>Epiſtle)</hi> by which they muſt come, to wit, <hi>not by Workes,
but by Faith:</hi> We ſhall much wrong <hi>St. Paul,</hi> and our own ſoules more, if
we apply theſe words, <hi>It is not of him that willeth &amp;c.</hi> to any other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
or ſtretch them further then thus; <q>Every man muſt ſincerely and
truely renounce his own will, that he may unfeignedly ſubmit himſelf to
<hi>Gods will:</hi> Every man muſt utterly revoke his own waies and abandon
thoſe courſes wherein fleſh and blood moſt delight, that he may run
(as we ſay) with <hi>Might and Maine</hi> to Gods mercies, and freely denying
himſelf, wholly betake himſelf unto them.</q> Or taking the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<hi>[It is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God
that ſheweth mercy,]</hi> Its all one as if he had ſaid; <q>It is to no purpoſe what
ye <hi>will,</hi> or whither ye <hi>run,</hi> unleſſe ye run unto Gods promſes made in
Chriſt: By proving moſt excellent in any other courſe of life, though
in the excellent knowledge of the Law, unleſſe withall ye bend your courſe
unto this mark which I ſet before you, you may make your ſelves ſuch
as God hath decreed to harden; for as <hi>he ſheweth mercy on whom he will
ſhew mercy;</hi> So <hi>whom he will he hardeneth.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. But doth this <hi>Concluſion</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtle's</hi> any way import, that God
ſhould deny mercy to any that unfainedly ſeek it? It rather implies that
he ſhewes mercy to all ſuch, in abundance. The Principal and moſt <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
Senſe</hi> of <hi>Gods Words</hi> urged by our <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> as they reſpect <hi>Moſe's Petition</hi>
concerning himſelf, is this; <q>
                        <hi>Where I ſhew mercy I will ſhew mercy to the
purpoſe.</hi>
                     </q> For when He had told <hi>Moſes,</hi> that he would proclaim His Name
before him, his <hi>Firſt Titles</hi> are, <hi>The Lord, The Lord God, mercyful and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,
long-ſuffering and abundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping mercy for
thouſands, forgiving tranſgreſſion, Iniquitie and ſin &amp;c. Viſiting the iniquitie
of the fathers upon the children &amp;c. Exod.</hi> 34. 6. This <hi>Senſe</hi> well fitts our
<hi>Apoſtles Inſtance</hi> in <hi>Iacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">See Geu. 36.</note> For God was mercyfull unto <hi>Eſau;</hi> whom
he bleſt, and made a Father, at leaſt, of One conſiderable Nation; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
mercifull unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> becauſe his purpoſe was to give the world a
manifeſt proof of his extraordinary Goodneſſe, in him; as he did of his
ſeveritie in hardening <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> who had made up the meaſure of his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers
iniquitie, which God (as in the former place he had ſaid to <hi>Moſes)</hi>
did viſit upon him. But of this Inſtance concerning Pharaoh, and the ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
which the Apoſtle borrowes from the Potter, we ſhall ſpeak, if God
permitt, hereafter.</p>
                  <p>13.<note place="margin">See Chap. 42. Numb. 9.</note> If we put the former verſes and the words of this verſe together, our
Apoſtle ſaith neither more nor leſſe in them, then <hi>our Saviour</hi> implyed in
that ſpeech, <hi>Whoſoever he be of you that forſaketh not all that he hath, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be my diſciple.</hi> And not being his diſciple, it is impoſſible he ſhould
find mercy: Or, profeſſing himſelf to be his diſciple, and not willing to
learn this Leſſon of <hi>denying himſelf,</hi> (the latter end ſhall be worſe then the
begining; that is) he ſhall be hardened.</p>
                  <p>But ſhall all that truely forſake themſelves be aſſuredly his diſciples,
<pb n="3218" facs="tcp:100044:127"/>
and find that mercy which God promiſed unto <hi>Moſes?</hi> Yes: Chriſt, hath
promiſed to all without exception; <hi>There is no man that hath left houſe or
brethren, or ſiſters, or father, or mother, or wife or children, or lands for my
ſake and for the goſpels, but he ſhall receive an hundred fold in this life, and
in the world to come eternal life.</hi> Mark 10. 29, 30.</p>
                  <p>14. But if there be a poſſibilitie for All unfainedly to fly unto Gods mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyes;
and if All that fly unto them ſhall undoubtedly find them, and make
their <hi>Election</hi> ſure;<note place="margin">See Chap. 32.</note> how is not election <hi>ex Praeviſis operibus,</hi> ſeeing to fly
unfainedly to Gods mercyes, is truly a <hi>Work,</hi> yea an induſtrious Work.</p>
                  <p>Now to make workes neceſſary or ordinarily available to our Firſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
may ſeem a point of <hi>Poperie,</hi> if not a degree of <hi>Pelagianiſm.</hi> To
this purpoſe ſome ſons of our common Mother would interpret My mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſhould I utter this Doctrin in ſome publik Audience.<note place="margin">This was a Sermon preach<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ed in C. C. C. Chappel in Oxon, 20, or 30. yeares ſince.</note> Howbeit, in
<hi>truth</hi> and veritie there is no doctrine under heaven with which my former
<hi>Aſſertion</hi> may better ſtand, then with the Doctrine of the <hi>Engliſh Church:</hi>
No Tenet or Principle of any other Religion whatſoever that can ſo direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
clear the former <hi>Objection,</hi> as doth the <hi>Fundamental Article</hi> of that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
which is profeſſed by all the Reformed Churches; Do not all

the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and as commonly denyed by every <hi>Proteſtant;</hi> and I ſhall make
his <hi>Anſwer</hi> as well fitt the former <hi>Objection,</hi> or any inconvenience that can
be pretended againſt the former <hi>Aſſertions.</hi> The Argument uſed by our
Adverſaries, is; <hi>[Works of Faith are true Workes:</hi> and <hi>to believe in
Chriſt is a true work of Faith. Now if we cannot be Iuſtified but by believing
in Chriſt, it is impoſſible we ſhould be Iuſtified Without good workes.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Anſwer, to this Captious Syllogiſm, moſt uſed by the Reformed Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
is, <hi>Fides juſtificat, non quà Opus, ſed Relativè.</hi> I like their <hi>Meaning</hi> well;
but their <hi>Manner of expreſſing</hi> is not ſo Artificial as it might be, and therefore
more Obnoxious to Exception. I would anſwer (as I take it) more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitely
to the ſame Effect; <hi>[To renounce all works and ſeek ſalvation only by
Plea of mercy, is the proper and Formal Work of Faith, and therefore is eſſentially
included in the Act of Juſtification; not included in the univerſalitie of works, which
are excluded from juſtification.]</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Did not Prieſts (as the Proverb is) forget that they had been Clerkes: Or
rather could great Clerkes in Divinitie remember what they had learned
when they were Punie Artiſts, the former <hi>Objection</hi> or the like could never
have troubled them; the Form of it (drawn into <hi>Mood and Figure)</hi> being
ſo childiſhly Captious, as would be exploded out of the Schooles of Arts,
ſhould it be ſtood upon in good earneſt. If ſuch Divines as urge it moſt
ſhould come into our <hi>Per-vices,</hi> and apply it to matters there diſcuſſed, thus,

                  <p>I hope a meaner Artiſt then this Nurſery (God be praiſed) hath any,
would quickly cut off their progreſs with a <hi>Diſtinction</hi> of <hi>Viſibile ut quod, &amp;
<pb n="3219" facs="tcp:100044:127"/>
viſible ut quo;</hi> and ſhew that the <hi>Major,</hi> though univerſally true of every
Subject or body that may be ſeen, did not, nor could not comprehend <hi>Colour
it ſelf</hi> by which they are made viſible, and by whoſe Formal Act they are
denominated <hi>colorata.</hi> The <hi>Fallacie</hi> of the former <hi>Objection</hi> drawn into <hi>Mood
and Figure,</hi> is the ſame, but more apparent;</p>
                  <p>Every Will or Work of Man muſt be utterly renounced from the Act of Juſtification
or Converſion.</p>
                  <p>But to deny our ſelves and renounce all works, is a Work;</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ergo,</hi> This work muſt be excluded from the ſuit of mercy, as no way available, Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus
contrarium verum eſt.</p>
                  <p>Seeing <hi>This is opus quo renunciamus,</hi> the Formal Act by which all works muſt be
renounced: This Work muſt of Neceſſitie be included in the ſuite of mercy,
and is alwaies Precedent to every mans firſt Converſion, whoſe calling is not
extraordinary. Neither may we that are Miniſters of Gods word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments,
preſume to give any man hope of being converted without this
work or Act. Unleſſe we thus diſtinguiſh between <hi>Works</hi> and <hi>Renouncing of
Works,</hi> and grant in man before his effectual Vocation or Converſion, <hi>as true
a poſsibilitie</hi> to do the <hi>One,</hi> as <hi>want of abilitie</hi> to perform the <hi>Other,</hi> we ſhall ſett
the ſoules of our hearers in a perpetual <hi>Backwater,</hi> or cauſe them to flote
Ambiguouſly as it were between the main Current of ſacred Scriptures
and the ſtream of antient Interpreters, both gratiouſly inviting all to Gods
mercy; and the fierce Current of modern opinions which deny all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie
of running (in any ſort) to Gods mercy before Grace infuſed do
draw us. The unſeaſonable overflow of Which newly-out-burſt doctrine
through out our Land, doth more miſchief to mens ſoules, then the
ſummer floods do to their fields. But if we give that <hi>Vent</hi> or iſſue to this
<hi>Eddye</hi> or whirlepool which the former Diſtinction naturally implies, we
ſhall lett our Auditors or Hearers at liberty to take ſea-room enough:
And the breath of Gods ſpirit plentifully diffuſed throughout the whole
Current of His Word, will, as a gentlegale, impell them forward unto that
haven, where-unto theſe preſent meditations are bound, which only affords
ſafe harbour unto all that ſeek to arrive at it, be they never ſo many.</p>
                  <p>15. Inſtead of an exhortation; You my Brethren, that are annoynted
to preach Gods mercy to the people, give me leave to propoſe that counſel
which I follow my ſelf. Seeing the iniquitie of the times wherein we live,
will not ſuffer us to perſwade our ſelves that the moſt part of thoſe to whom
we preach, are <hi>in the ſtate of Grace,</hi> Let us make this account, that there is a
farr greater neceſſitie layd upon us to teach the means, How men may be
brought unto the ſtate of Grace, then to frame <hi>Characters</hi> whereby they may

Now I knovv not hovv it comes to paſſe, but queſtionleſſe by the
infinite Wiſdom and never ſufficiently admired <hi>Goodneſſe of our God,</hi> that
there is no Object of Belief, of vvhoſe truth the unregenerate man can have
ſuch ſtrong Hiſtorical or Moral perſvvaſions as of the Points novv delivered:
No Practiſe vvhereto they can vvith like Facilitie or hope of ſureneſſe be
ſvvayed or vvrought, as unto <hi>Denyal of themſelves</hi> and <hi>Deſire of his mercy.</hi> Do
ye demand of me a Reaſon of this <hi>Aſſertion?</hi> It is Plain and palpable to your
ovvn ſenſes: That vvhich diſinables them for performing any Good, and
makes them uncapable of all other ſaving Truths, is, by <hi>Divine Providence,</hi>
made a <hi>Natural Ground</hi> of theſe perſvvaſions;</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="3220" facs="tcp:100044:128"/>
                     <hi>Their very dulneſſe is as a ſpur to incite alacritie in theſe duties.</hi> Every mans Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
that hath any touch of moral honeſty, any ſenſe of good or evill, will
throughly inſtruct him, that the more impotent and unable he is to follow
that in practice which his mind approves, the deeper ſenſe he may have of
this his Impotency, and ſurer arguments of the ſlavery of his unregenerate
Will. Now it is <hi>the infinite mercy of God</hi> not to exact more of any, then they
are able to do before their Converſion: that is not to exact any thing of
them that is <hi>truly good;</hi> or if you will, <hi>any thing which doth not in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
ſerve Hell:</hi> And yet <hi>His Infinite juſtice</hi> requires of all that they ſincere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and heartily, though but <hi>Morally,</hi> acknowledge &amp; bewaile this their <hi>natural
Impotencie</hi> or want of abilitie to do any thing that is Good, before they can be
Converted or inabled to do better. The not uſing of this <hi>Natural capacitie,</hi>
whereby collapſed man only exceeds divels in natural goodneſſe, or rather
comes ſhort of them in natural iniquitie, is that which makes all that hear the
Goſpel and obey it not, inexcuſable. But ſhall all that uſe this Capacitie
right be aſſured to have it filled with Grace? Yes: the Spirit hath ſealed
their Aſſurance,<note place="margin">Iſa. 1. 16.</note> 
                     <hi>Draw neer to to God, and he will draw neer to you, Caſt down
your ſelves before the Lord and he will lift you up.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jam. 4. 10.</note> So then, we have better abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
or opportunities to caſt our ſelves down then to lift our ſelves up: And
the Lord hath a more ſpeciall hand in lifting us up, then in caſting us down.
Our Impotencie to walk uprightly, our naturall proneneſſe to all manner
of evill, and the weight of our actual ſins, do much help and in a manner
impell us (ſo we would not be wilfull) to caſt our ſelves down before the
throne of Grace, by whoſe power only we muſt be lifted up, without any
help or indeavour of our own. Herein I muſt commend the <hi>Anti-Lutherans
modeſtie</hi> for not calling <hi>St. Iames</hi> his Authoritie in queſtion, albeit his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
in this Point makes more againſt him, then it doth againſt the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theran</hi>
or other <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in the Point of <hi>Iuſtification:</hi> And it is good wiſdom
for him ſo to do, at leaſt it were bootleſſe for him to do the contrary, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
our Saviour hath ſaid no leſſe, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and I will give you reſt.</hi> Mat. 11. The greater our labour is, the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vier
our load, Or the more weary we grow under it; the readier we are
to run with better ſpeed to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> unto whom the feeble, blind, and lame
were moſt frequent and moſt earneſt Supplicants. And our coming to
him conſiſts not either in ſtrength or agilitie of bodie, but in the frequency
of Supplications and depth of groanes. It was his ſaying; <hi>They that are
whole, need not the Phyſitian but they that are ſick.</hi> We muſt feel our ſelves ſick
at the heart, before this our heavenly Phyſitian will begin his Cure,
or uſe his Skill by applying the Medicine of ſaving Grace.</p>
                  <p>16. Is it then impoſſible for the unregenerate Man to feel his infirmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
to be morally perſwaded of the Soules immortalitie, or to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
affrighted with terrour of conſcience? or ſo affected. Is it impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſible
to implore his heavenly Phyſitians help with as great care and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
as he would an Earthly Phyſitians preſence to ſave his Body in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
ſickneſſe?</p>
                  <p>It were rather impoſſible that any, who is not an abſolute Atheiſt, (ſuch
as it is ſcarce poſſible for any man to be) ſhould be ſo ſlothfull and careleſſe
in coming to <hi>Chriſt</hi> as the moſt part of men are; were they not (through
our ſloth or ignorance, or through our factious ſkill and induſtrie that ſhould
inſtruct them) led on as it were in a drowſie dreame to imagine, that
Gods mercy would either come unto them without ſeeking, or that it
were impoſſible for them to do any thing, before it apprehend them, that
<pb n="3221" facs="tcp:100044:128"/>
might infallibly availe for the finding of it, or rather for being found
and imbraced by it. The natural man is not ſo unnatural to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
as not to deſire eaſe in true ſenſe of actual paine; or exemption from
danger, which his ſoul doth dread: Nor is he ſo Brutiſh as to think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
not beholding to him that in theſe Caſes is able and willing to afford
him Comfort. It is the <hi>Duty</hi> and ſhould be the <hi>Care</hi> of us, whom that
<hi>Great heavenly Phyſitian</hi> hath appointed to viſit his Patients, <hi>Firſt,</hi> to work
a ſenſe and feeling of that natural Infirmitie,<note place="margin">Plinie. See Chapt. 8. and Fol. 3145.</note> whereof the <hi>Great Naturaliſt</hi>
was (without an Inſtructer) very ſenſible. <hi>Secondly</hi> to confirm their
Belief of <hi>this Article;</hi> That no preſent Fee or hope of praiſe amongſt men,
can make any earthly Phyſitian half ſo ready to cure their bodies, as he
that out of his <hi>Free Bounty</hi> made their ſoules, is at all times to repair them,
ſo they would but Implore his <hi>Omnipotent Mercy</hi> with as true and hearty
affections, as they do the help of their bodily comforters in diſtreſs.</p>

Will, or Induration <hi>may be ſaid to be</hi> irreſiſtible whom he will he hardeneth.</p>
                  <p>3.<note place="margin">Gods Will.</note> Not to trouble you with any curious <hi>Diſtinctions</hi> concerning <hi>Gods Will:</hi>

Albeit <hi>Gods Will</hi> be moſt truly and indiviſibly <hi>One,</hi> and in indiviſible unitie
moſt truly infinite and immutable: yet is it <hi>Immutably free,</hi> Omnipotently
able to produce pluralitie as well as unitie, mutabilitie as well as immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie,

                  <p>By the ſame immutable and indiviſible <hi>Will,</hi> he ordained that other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents

                  <p>The <hi>Pſalmiſt's Oracle</hi> (Pſal. 5.) is univerſally true of all perſons in every
age; of <hi>Adam</hi> ſpecially before his Fall; <hi>Non Deus volens iniquitatem tu es:</hi>
God doth not, he cannot will iniquitie. And yet we ſee the world is full
of it. The Apoſtles ſpeech again is as univerſally true; <hi>This is the will of
God, even your ſanctification, that every one of you ſhould know how to poſſeſſe his

ſonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> whom he created after his own image and ſimilitude. So
then, he neither <hi>wils</hi> mens goodneſs nor <hi>nils</hi> their iniquitie by his <hi>Irreſiſtible
will.</hi> He truly willed <hi>Adams</hi> integritie, but not by his <hi>irreſiſtible Will:</hi> For
ſo <hi>Adams</hi> could not have fallen. What? ſhall we ſay then, that God did will
<hi>Adams</hi> Fall, by his <hi>irreſiſtible will?</hi> God forbid: For ſo <hi>Adam</hi> could not but have
ſinned. Where is the mean or <hi>middle Station,</hi> on which we may build our
faith? The immediate Object of <hi>Gods irreſiſtible Will,</hi> in this Caſe, was <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams</hi>
Free-will' that is, <hi>Poteſtas labendi, &amp; poteſtas ſtandi:</hi> Power to ſtand

of heart, as the heating of water doth to the quick freezing of it, when it is
taken off the fire and ſet in the cold aire. Both theſe Actions, or rather
both theſe qualities of heat and cold, have their proper influence into
this effect. If a Phyſician ſhould miniſter ſome phyſical drink unto his
patient, and heap clothes upon him with purpoſe to prevent ſome diſeaſe
by a kindly ſweat; and the Patient throughly heated, wilfully throw
them off: <hi>both</hi> may be ſaid <hi>poſitive cauſes</hi> of the cold, which would neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
enſue from both actions; albeit the <hi>Patient</hi> only were the true <hi>moral
Cauſe,</hi> or the only blame-worthy Cauſe of his own death or danger fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.
Iuſt according to the importance of this ſuppoſition or ſimilitude,
is the cauſe of hardening, in many caſes, to be divided betwixt God and man.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did harden their own hearts in the wilderneſs; and yet their
hearts had not been ſo hardened, unleſs the Lord had done ſo many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in their ſight. In every wonder his purpoſe was to beget <hi>Beleife:</hi> but
through their wilfull unbeleife, the beſt effect of his greateſt wonders was
induration and impenitencie. Now as it ſuits not with the Rules of good
manners for <hi>Phyſicians</hi> to tie a mans hands (of diſcretion or place) leſt
he may uſe them to his owne harm: ſo neither was it conſonant to the
<hi>Rules of eternal equitie,</hi> that God ſhould neceſſitate the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Wills to
a true Beleif of his wonders, or mollifie their hearts againſt their will;
that is, <hi>He neither hardens nor mollifies their hearts by his Irreſiſtible Will;
nor did he at all will their hardning, but rather mollification.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>5. All this is true of Gods ordinary manner of hardning men, or of the
firſt degrees of hardning any man, <hi>But Pharaohs Caſe is Extraordinary.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Pharaoh was hardned by Gods <hi>Irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Will.</hi>

                        <q>
                           <hi>Beza</hi> rightly inferrs againſt <hi>Origen</hi> and his followers; that this <hi>hardening</hi>
whereof the Apoſtle here ſpeaketh, was <hi>Irreſiſtible;</hi> that the party thus
hardened was uncapable of repentance; that God did ſhew ſignes
and wonders in <hi>Egypt,</hi> not with purpoſe to reclaim but to harden <hi>Pharaoh,</hi>
&amp; to drive him headlong into the ſnare prepared for him from everlaſting.</q>
All theſe <hi>Inferences</hi> are plain. Firſt, that Interrogation <hi>[Who hath reſiſted
his Will?]</hi> is equivalent to the univerſal negative, <hi>No man, no creature can
at any time reſiſt his will.</hi> That is, according to the interpretation premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<hi>Whatſoever particular Gods Will is to have</hi> neceſſary, <hi>or ſo to be, as the
Contrary or Contradictorie to it ſhall not be; the Exiſtence of it cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
or avoyded.</hi> Now that God did in this peremptory manner will <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raohs</hi>

unto him by <hi>Moſes,</hi>

from the Tenor of this meſſage, the Apoſtle inferres the latter part of this

it is impoſſible they ſhould eſcape it,<note place="margin">Whether Pharaoh were an abſolute reprobate, or created to be Hardened</note> or his judgments due unto it.</p>
                     <p>In all theſe collections <hi>Beza</hi> doth not erre. Yet was <hi>Beza</hi> (with reverence
be it ſpoken) more fowly to blame then this <hi>filthy Writer,</hi> (for ſo it pleaſeth
him to entitle <hi>Origen)</hi> in that he referres theſe threatnings, <hi>[For this very

we need not, we may not grant) but to his <hi>Extraction out of the womb;</hi> yea
to his <hi>firſt Creation</hi> out of the duſt: as if the Almighty had moulded him
by his <hi>Irreſiſtible Will,</hi> in the eternal <hi>Idea</hi> of Reprobation, before man or
Angel had actual Being: as if the only end of his Being had been to be a
<hi>Reprobate</hi> or <hi>veſſel of wrath. Beza's</hi> Collections to this purpoſe (unleſſe they
be better limited, than he hath left them) make God, not onely a direct

a more direct and more <hi>neceſſary Cauſe</hi> of his butchering the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>

was no <hi>neceſſarie,</hi> nor immutable <hi>Cauſe;</hi> that is, <hi>he did not decree that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dams

for this interpretation, is the hiſtorical circumſtance of time and manner of
Gods proceeding with <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> For this expoſtulation, whereunto our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle
in this place hath reference, was uttered after the <hi>ſeventh wonder</hi>
wrought by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> in the ſight of <hi>Pharaoh;</hi> upon which it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
ſaid, that <hi>The Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, that he hearkened not

wonder</hi> may be read <hi>imperſonally,</hi> or be referred to the wonder it ſelf, which
might <hi>poſitively harden</hi> his heart in ſuch a ſenſe as is before expreſſed. Nor is

his Commiſſion to <hi>Moſes</hi> and his threats to <hi>Pharaoh. Exod. 9. 13, &amp;c.
Thus ſaith the Lord God of the Hebrewes, Let my people go, that they may ſerve me.

                        <q>God indeed had just cauſe to upbraid Pharaoh heretofore, for neglect of
his Signs and wonders: for it was a foul fault in him not to relent, ſo long as there

him any longer? Why doth he hold on to expoſtulate more ſharply with him than
heretofore, for that which is impoſſible for him to avoid? For is it poſſible for him
to open the door of repentance, when God hath ſhut it? or to mollifie his heart,

Now this <hi>Rejoynder</hi> (to ſpeak according to the Rules of modeſtie and good

For what is man in reſpect of God? any better than an artificial body

<hi>[<q>When I was ſpoiled in the making, why didſt thou rather reſerve me to

The Potter at leaſt would take ſo much authority on him, as to

                           <hi>I will appoint every veſſel to what uſe I think fit; not to ſuch uſe as every

                     </p>
                     <p>Now all that our Apoſtle in <hi>this ſimilitude</hi> intends, is, that we muſt attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
more unto the Creators skill and wiſdom in diſpenſing mercy and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
or in preparing <hi>veſſels of wrath,</hi> and <hi>veſſels of honour,</hi> than we do unto
the <hi>Potters</hi> judgment in diſcerning clay, or fitting every part of his matter
to it's right and moſt commodious uſe. Yet in all theſe, <hi>The Potter is judge,</hi>
ſaith the Author of the Book of <hi>Wiſdom.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Wiſdom 15. 7</note> That very veſſel which miniſtred
the matter of this ſimilitude to our Apoſtle, Jer. 18. 4. was ſo <hi>marred in the

firſt intended for. That it marred in the firſt making, was the fault of the
clay. So to faſhion it anew, as neither ſtuffe, nor former labour ſhould be

whom he borrowes it, had made to his hand? <hi>O houſe of Iſrael, cannot I do

                     <p>10. The true and full Implication is thus much and no more; <q>Albeit
God ſought to prepare them to glorie, yet had they a poſſibilitie or liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie

he was able to form them again, to an end quite contrary unto that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

9, 10.</p>
                     <p>And here we muſt requeſt our Reader alwaies to remember, that the
Apoſtle compares God, not to a Phrantick, or Phantaſtick Potter, delighted

only to ſhew his <hi>Imperial Authoritie</hi> over a piece of clay. He Imagineth
ſuch a Potter as the Wiſe man did, that knowes a reaſon why he makes one
veſſel of this faſhion, another of that; why he appoints this to a baſe uſe,
that to a better: albeit an unskilful By-ſtander could perhaps diſcern no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
in the ſtuff or matter whereof they are made.</p>
                     <p>The ſumme then of our Apoſtles intended <hi>Inference</hi> is this; <q>As it is an
unmannerly point for any man to conteſt, or wrangle with a skilfull Artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer
in his own facultie, of whom he ſhould rather deſire to learn with ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion:
ſo it is damnable preſumption for any creature to diſpute with
his Creator in matters of Providence, or of the worlds regiment; or to
debate his own caſe with him thus; <hi>Seeing all of us were made of the ſame
Maſſe, I might have been graced as others have been with wealth, with honour,

reſerve him alive in the ſtate of mortalitie, after the ſentence of death is

ſtill augment <hi>Pharaohs</hi> puniſhment, as if it were now as poſſible for him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,
as once it was, is intimated by our Apoſtle to be <hi>this;</hi> that by this leni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
towards <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> he might ſhew his wrath and declare his power againſt
ſuch ſinners as he was, that all the world might <hi>hear and fear,</hi> and learn by
his overthrow not to ſtrive againſt their Maker, nor to dally with his fearfull
warnings. Had <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his people died of the peſtilence or other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe,
when the cattel periſhed of the murrain, the terror of Gods powerfull
wrath had not been ſo manifeſt and viſible to all the world, as it was in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throwing
the whole ſtrength of Egypt, which had taken armes and ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in battell againſt him. Now the more ſtrange the Infatuation, the
more fearfull and ignominious the deſtruction of theſe <hi>veſſels of wrath</hi> did
appear unto the world; the more brightly did <hi>the riches of Gods glory</hi> ſhine
to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> whom he was now preparing for <hi>veſſels of mercy;</hi> the hearts
of whoſe poſteritie he did not ſo effectually fitt or ſeaſon for the infuſion of
his ſanctifying Grace, by any ſecondary meanes whatſoever, as by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
memory of this glorious victory over <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his mighty hoſt.
But this faithleſs generation (whoſe reformation our Apoſtle ſo anxiouſly
ſeeks) did take all theſe glorious tokens of Gods extraordinary free love and
mercy towards their Fathers, for irrevocable Earneſts or obligements to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
their <hi>Abſolute Predeſtination</hi> unto honour and glory, and to prepare the
Gentiles to be <hi>veſſels of infamie</hi> and deſtruction. Now our Apoſtles earneſt
deſire and unquenchable zeal to prevent this dangerous preſumption in his
Country-men, enforceth him in ſtead of applying this <hi>ſecond Anſwer</hi> to the
point in <hi>queſtion,</hi> to advertiſe them for <hi>Concluſion,</hi> that the <hi>Egyptians Caſe</hi> was

been alwaies in him. Without alteration of his perſon or nature, he was
ſubject to great varietie of qualifications: and each qualification capable of
divers degrees and different diſproportion with the <hi>eternal and unchangeable
Rule of goodneſſe.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Minor Propoſition,</hi> albeit eternally true,

firſt and laſt owners ſhould have ſold or bought Scarlet by this one and the
ſame <hi>Scepter;</hi> they ſhould have found a great alteration in the meaſure. So
then, it is <hi>one thing</hi> to be one and the ſelf-ſame <hi>Standard;</hi> and <hi>Another thing</hi>
to be one and the ſelf-ſame <hi>Staffe</hi> or <hi>Scepter.</hi> The leaſt alteration in length
or quantitie that can be, doth alter the <hi>Identitie</hi> of any <hi>meaſure:</hi> but not the
<hi>Identitie</hi> of the material <hi>ſubſtance</hi> of that which is the <hi>meaſure.</hi> The ſame
grains of barly which grow this year, may be kept till ſeven years hence;
But he that ſhould lend gold according to their weight this year, and receive
it according to their weight at the ſeven years end, ſhould find great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
in the ſummes: though the grains be for number &amp; ſubſtance the ſame,
yet their weights are divers. Or, ſuppoſe it be true which is related of the
<hi>Great Magore,</hi> that he weighs himſelf every year in gold, and diſtributes the
ſumme thereof to the poor; and that he had continued this cuſtom from the
ſeventh year of his age: yet cannot there be half the difference betwixt the
weight of one and the ſame Prince in his child-hood and in his full age, (after
many heartie prayers to make him fatt) as is between the different mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> induration within the compaſſe of one year.</p>
                     <p>Therefore this Argument, <hi>[Pharaoh was hardened after the ſeventh plague
by Gods irreſiſtible Will:</hi> Ergo, <hi>He was an irrecoverable reprobate from his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood]</hi>
is to a man of underſtanding more groſs, than if we ſhould argue thus;
<hi>[The great Magore distributed to the poor five thouſand pounds in gold in his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth
year:</hi> Ergo, <hi>He diſtributed ſo much every year, ſince he began this cuſtom of
weighing himſelf in gold.]</hi> For as he diſtributes unto the poor, not accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Identitie</hi> of his perſon, but according to the <hi>Identitie</hi> or <hi>Diverſitie</hi> of
his weight: ſo doth the <hi>Immutable Rule of Juſtice</hi> render unto every man, not
according to the <hi>Vnitie of of his Perſon,</hi> but according to the <hi>Diverſitie</hi> of his
work. Unto the ſeveral meaſures of one and the ſame mans iniquities, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
meaſures of <hi>Induration</hi> (whether <hi>Poſitive</hi> or <hi>privative)</hi> are allotted
from eternitie. But <hi>Final induration by Gods irreſiſtible Will,</hi> or irrecoverable
Reprobation, is the juſt recompence of the full meaſure of iniquitie; or (as
the Prophet ſpeakes) To harden thus,<note place="margin">Q. Whether he mean, Dan. 9. 24.</note> 
                        <hi>is to ſeal up iniquitie to deſtruction,</hi>
without hope or poſſibilitie of Pardon.</p>
                     <p>20. Theſe <hi>two Propoſitions</hi> are of like eternal truth; <hi>[God from eternitie de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed
by his irreſistible will to harden Pharaoh having made up the full meaſure of
his iniquitie:]</hi> and <hi>[God from eternitie did not decree by his Irreſiſtible Will, that
Pharaoh ſhould make up ſuch a meaſure of iniquitie.]</hi> For, <hi>he doth not decree ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie
at all, much leſſe full meaſures of iniquitie.</hi> And yet, unleſſe he ſo decree,
not iniquitie only, but the full meaſure of it; <hi>Pharaohs</hi> Induration or Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
was not <hi>abſolutely neceſſary,</hi> in reſpect of Gods eternal Decree. For
It was <hi>no more neceſſary,</hi> than was the <hi>full meaſure of iniquitie</hi> unto which it

                     <p>From theſe deductions I may clear a debt, for which I ingaged my ſelf,
in my laſt publick meditations. My promiſe was then, to make it evident,
that theſe two Propoſitions, 1. <hi>[God from Eternitie decreed to harden Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh
by his Irreſiſtible Will;] 2. [God from Eternitie did not decree to hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
Pharaoh by his Irreſiſtible Will,]</hi> might eaſily be made good friends, if
their Abettors would ceaſe to urge them beyond their natural diſpoſitions.<note place="margin">See Attribut. 1. part. Ch. 15. Numb. 7.</note>
For in their natures, they are <hi>Indefinites</hi> not <hi>Singulars.</hi> Both, in a good
ſenſe, may be made to tell the truth. But a wrangler may work them
Both to bear evidence for error. <hi>[God from eternitie decreed to harden Pharaoh
by his Irreſiſtible Will.]</hi> Tis true of <hi>Pharaoh ſo miſqualified</hi> as <hi>Moſes</hi> found
him perhaps when he brought the firſt, at leaſt, when he brought the
Seventh Meſſage to him. But falſe of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in his Infancie, or not laden
with ſuch a meaſure of Iniquitie, as by the Divine Decree was from Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
Sealed up for death. <hi>[God from eternitie did not decree to harden Pharaoh
by his Irreſiſtible Will,]</hi> is true of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> in his infancie or youth: but falſe
of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> after his wilfull contempt of Gods <hi>Summons</hi> by ſignes and

                        <hi>Beza's Collection</hi> upon this place, is grounded upon the <hi>Indefinite
Truth</hi> of this <hi>Affirmative; [God from eternitie decreed to harden Pharaoh.]</hi>
But he extends this <hi>Indefinite</hi> Truth beyond its compaſs. For he makes
it an <hi>Vniverſal,</hi> in that he terminates the <hi>Irreſiſtible decree</hi> to every moment
of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> life, without <hi>Diſtinction</hi> of <hi>Qualification.</hi> And it may be, he
was of opinion, that as well each ſeveral qualification, as each different
meaſure of <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> hardening or impenitency, did come to paſſe by <hi>Gods
Irreſiſtible Will.</hi> His Error, into which the greateſt Clerk living (eſpecially
if he be not an accurate <hi>Philoſopher)</hi> might eaſily ſlide, conſiſts originally
in confounding <hi>Eternitie</hi> with <hi>Succeſsive Duration;</hi> and not diſtinguiſhing
<hi>Succeſſion</hi> it ſelf, from <hi>things durable or Succeſſive.</hi> He, and many others in
this argument, ſpeak as if they conceived that the <hi>neceſſary Coexiſtence of
Eternitie with Time</hi> did neceſſarily draw every mans whole courſe of life,
<hi>Motu quodam raptús,</hi> after ſuch a manner as <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> ſuppoſe that the
higheſt <hi>Sphere</hi> doth move the lower; whereas, if we ſpeak of the courſe,
not of <hi>Pharaoh's natural,</hi> but <hi>moral life;</hi> it was rather an Incondit <hi>heap</hi> or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed
multitude <hi>of durables,</hi> than <hi>one</hi> entire uniforme <hi>duration.</hi> And each
<hi>durable</hi> hath its diſtinct Reference to the eternal Decree. That which is
eternally true of <hi>one,</hi> was not at all, much leſſe eternally, true of <hi>another.</hi>
Eternitie it ſelf, though immutable, though neceſſarily, though indiviſibly
co-exiſtent to <hi>All,</hi> was not ſo indiſſolubly linked with <hi>Any,</hi> but that <hi>Pharaoh</hi>
might have altered or ſtayed his courſe of life before that moment, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the meaſure of iniquitie was accompliſhed: But in that moment he
became ſo exorbitant, that the <hi>Irreſiſtible Decree</hi> of induration did faſten
upon him. His Irregular motions have ever ſince become irrevocable; not his
<hi>Actions</hi> onely, but his <hi>Perſon,</hi> is carried headlong by the everlaſting revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the unchangable decree, into everlaſting unavoydable deſtruction.</p>
                     <p>22. The <hi>Propoſition</hi> or Concluſion propoſed, <hi>[Pharaoh was hardened by
Gods Irreſiſtible Will,]</hi> indefinitely taken is true from all eternitie, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
all eternitie; and therefore true from <hi>Pharaoh's</hi> birth unto his death:
but not therefore true of <hi>Pharaoh howſoever qualified,</hi> or of all <hi>Pharaoh's
Qualifications</hi> throughout the whole còurſe of his life. For ſo the <hi>Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition</hi>
becomes an <hi>Vniverſal,</hi> not onely in reſpect of the <hi>Time,</hi> but of the
<pb n="3238" facs="tcp:100044:137"/>
                        <hi>Subject;</hi> that is, of all <hi>Pharaohs</hi> ſeveral qualifications. The ſenſe is, as
if he had ſaid, <hi>[God from eternitie decreed to harden Pharaoh, howſoever
qualified, as well in his Infancie as his full Age, by his Irreſiſtible Will:</hi> and
thus taken it is Falſe. The <hi>Inference</hi> is the ſame with the fore-mentioned,
<hi>[Adam in Gods foreknowledge was a ſinner from eternitie;</hi> Ergo, <hi>Adam was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies
a ſinner; a Sinner before he ſinned, during the time of his innocencie:]</hi> or
with this, <hi>God from all eternitie did decree by his irreſiſtible Will, that Adam ſhould
die the death;</hi> Ergo, <hi>He did decree by his irreſiſtible Will, that Adam ſhould dye as
ſoon as he was created, or be a ſinner all his life long.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To reconcile theſe <hi>two Propoſitions</hi> aright, <hi>[God from eternitie decreed by his

is this, <hi>[God did decree by his Irreſiſtible Will, that Adam ſinning ſhould die:]
[God did not decree by his irreſiſtible-Will, that Adam not ſinning ſhould dye.]</hi> nor
did he decree by his <hi>Irreſiſtible Will,</hi> that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould ſin, that he might die.
For (as we ſaid before) God did neither decree his Fall, nor his perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
by his <hi>Irreſiſtible will.</hi> And his death was no more inevitable than his
Fall. Nor was <hi>Pharaohs</hi> final <hi>Induration</hi> more inevitable, than the meaſure
of iniquitie to which ſuch <hi>Induration</hi> was from eternitie awarded by Gods
<hi>Irreſiſtible will.</hi> Of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> thus conſidered, the <hi>Concluſion</hi> was true from

26. The former Reſemblance is fully Parallel to our Reſolution in all

direct or impell <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to make up the full meaſure of his iniquitie,
as it doth direct and guide the courſe of the <hi>Moon,</hi> till it come in full

courſe by the unchangeable decree, which in time will bring it to be in</hi> Diametral
oppoſition <hi>to the</hi> Sun <hi>and by conſequence to be</hi> Eclipſed: <hi>So though</hi> Pharaoh
<hi>in his infancie was not reprobated or hardened by Gods Irreſiſtible Will; yet
Was he by the eternal decree ordained to ſuch reprobation or induration,
without poſſibilitie of altering his courſe, or avoiding that</hi> oppoſition <hi>which
his full age had unto Divine Goodneſſe.</hi>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>As every true convert or regenerate perſon may ſay with him in Saint
<hi>Ambroſe, Ego non ſum Ego; I am become another man:</hi> ſo might it
be truly ſaid, in a contrarie ſenſe, <hi>Pharaoh ſometimes was not Pharaoh.</hi> When
he was a child, he ſpake as a child, he thought as a child: His mouth
was not not opened againſt God: his mind was not ſet on murther. To
have ſeen the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> infants ſtrangled or expoſed to the mercileſs flouds,
would more have affected his heart, being young and tender, than after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it did his daughters. Nor was that crueltie, which in his full age
he practiſed, ſo contained in his infancie, as poiſon in the ſerpents egge.
It did not grow up by kind or <hi>neceſſitie</hi> of his natural temper; much leſſe
was it infuſed by <hi>Gods Irreſiſtible Will:</hi> but acquired by Voluntarie cuſtom.
<hi>The ſeeds of it were ſown by his own ſelf-will: ambitious pride was the root:
politick jelouſie was the bud: tyrannie and oppreſſion, the fruit.</hi> Neither
was it neceſſary by the eternal decree, that this corrupt ſeed ſhould be ſown:
or that being ſown, it ſhould proſper and bud; or that after the budding,
it ſhould ripen in malignitie. During all this progreſs from bad to worſe,
the immediate <hi>Object</hi> of Gods Immutable and <hi>Vnreſiſtible Will</hi> was muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie
in <hi>Pharaoh.</hi> But this progreſs which was not <hi>neceſſarie</hi> by any eternal
decree or law, being <hi>de facto</hi> once accompliſhed, his deſtruction was
inevitable, his induration unreſiſtible, his reprobation irrecoverable, by
the eternal and uncontroulable Decree.</p>
                     <p>27.<note place="margin">That Pharaoh in his youth or infancie was not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded by Gods <hi>Irreſiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Will</hi> from poſſibilitie of repentance.</note> That <hi>Pharaoh in his youth or infancie was not ſuch an Object of Gods

                        <hi>The</hi> Major <hi>is evident from the expoſition of the Termes. For God

                     <p>In Arts or Sciences, diviſions ſhould be either formal by direct predica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
line, as that, <hi>[Of creatures indued with ſenſe, ſome have reaſon, ſome are
reaſonleſs:]</hi> or at leaſt ſo exact, that the ſeveral members of the diviſion
ſhould exhauſt the whole, or <hi>integrum</hi> divided. As if a <hi>Geographer</hi> ſhould
ſay, <hi>[Of the inhabitants of the earth, ſome are ſeated on this ſide the Line, others
beyond it,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">This <hi>Diviſion</hi> is not <hi>formal,</hi> nor ſo exact as is required in arts.</note> 
                        <hi>or juſt under it;]</hi> the diviſion were good: but very imperfect if
he ſhould ſay, <hi>[Some are ſeated between the Tropick of Cancer and the Artick circle;
others betwixt the Tropick of Capricorn and the circle Antartick:</hi> for a great
many are commodiouſly ſeated betwixt the <hi>Tropicks,</hi> (as experience hath
taught later ages to reform the errour of the Ancient:) and ſome likewiſe
betwixt the <hi>Polar circles</hi> and the <hi>Poles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But in matters arbitrarie and contingent (as matters of common uſe for
the moſt part are) to exact alike formal or accurate diviſions, is ridiculous;
eſpecially when as well the members of the diviſion as the dividend it ſelfe,
are terms indefinite. As if a man ſhould ſay, of men, <hi>[Some are extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily
good, ſome extraordinarily bad;]</hi> or of Academicks, <hi>[ſome are extraor di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily
acute, ſome are extraordinarily dull;]</hi> though every one will grant the
diviſion to be indefinitely true, yet no man almoſt would acknowledge him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to be contained under either member; as the moſt part of men are not
indeed. Or if one ſhould ſay, <hi>Every Prince ſheweth extraordinary favour to
ſome of his ſubjects, and ſome others he maketh examples (or ſubjects) of his ſeveri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie;</hi>
who could hence gather, that no part or not the greateſt part were left
to the ordinarie courſe of juſtice, or to the priviledges common to all free
denizons? Now we are here to remember what was premiſed in the entrie
into this Treatiſe; <hi>That albeit Gods Will be moſt immutable, yet is it immutably
free,</hi> more free by much than the Changeable will of man. So are the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
of this his Free-will more arbitrarie, than the deſigns of Princes. The
Objects of his Will in this our preſent argument, are <hi>mercie</hi> and <hi>induration:</hi>
and theſe he awards to divers perſons; or to the ſame perſons, at divers times,
according to a different meaſure. Whence, if we take theſe termes, in
that extraordinary meaſure which is included in this diviſion,<note place="margin">That moſt men are not comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther member of this <hi>diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</hi>
                        </note> the moſt part
of men, with whom we ſhall uſually have to deale, do not fall within either
member. The <hi>proper,</hi> perhaps the <hi>only ſubjects</hi> of this <hi>diviſion</hi> it ſelf in <hi>Moſes</hi>
time, were the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>Egyptians:</hi> in our Apoſtles time, the <hi>caſt-away
Jews,</hi> and ſuch of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> as were forthwith to be ingrafted in their ſtead.
If we take <hi>mercie</hi> and <hi>induration</hi> in a leſſer meaſure, according to their lower
degrees or firſt diſpoſitions, ſcarce any man living of riper years but hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved
from the one part of this diviſion unto the other, oftner then he hath
eaten, drank, or ſlept. Chriſts Diſciples (ſaith Saint <hi>Mark, Chap. 6. v.</hi> 52.)
<hi>had not Conſidered the miracle of the loaves, becauſe their hearts were hardened;</hi> yet
ſhortly after to be <hi>mollifyed,</hi> that Gods mercie and Chriſts miracles might
find more eaſie entrance into them. Our habitual temper is, for the moſt
part, mutable: how much more our actual deſires or operations? And
whatſoever is mutably good or mutably evill in reſpect of its acts and ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,<note place="margin">One and the ſame man ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diverſitie of <hi>time or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lification</hi> may be the true and proper <hi>ſubject</hi> of both parts of <hi>this diviſion.</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>31. The doctrine contained in this paſſage of Scripture will never ſound
well for the right ſetling the affections and conſciences of ſuch as be Novices
in faith, untill they be taught to run this diviſion upon the ſame ſtring:</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="3244" facs="tcp:100044:140"/>
                        <hi>Haſt thou been enlightned and taſted of the heavenly gift, made partaker of the Holy
Spirit?</hi> Thy ſin is great, and thou art found a deſpiſer of the riches of his
bountie, unleſs thou embrace theſe illuminations as undoubted pledges of
his favour, and aſſured teſtimonies of his good purpoſe to make thee heir of
eternal life. Worthy thou art to be numbred among thoſe perverſe and
wayward <hi>Jews</hi> whom our Saviour compares to children playing in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
if while theſe Good motions and exultations of ſpirit laſt, thou giveſt
not more attentive ear (than he that danceth doth to him that pipeth or har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth)
unto that ſweet voice of thy heavenly Father encouraging thee in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
as he did ſometimes the hoſt of Iſrael, <hi>Oh that there were ſuch an heart
in thee alwaies, that it might go well with thee for ever.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>But eſchew theſe and the like inferences as cunning <hi>Sophiſmes</hi> of the great
Tempter, that old and ſubtile Serpent, <hi>I thank God I have felt the good motions
of the Spirit, I perceive the pledges of his good purpoſe towards me: but his purpoſe
is unchangeable: Therefore is my Election ſure enough, I am a ſealed veſſel of mercy,
I cannot become a veſſel of wrath.</hi> If ſuch thoughts have at any time inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
into thy heart, or be darted upon thee againſt thy will; remember thy
ſelf in time, and thus repell them: <hi>If God harden whom he will; if his Will be
immutably and eternally free; it is as free for him to harden me as any other.</hi> And
conſider withall, that albeit thou canſt not make or prepare thy ſelf to be <hi>a
veſſel of mercy:</hi> yet thy untimely preſumption, if it continue long, in the
end will make thee, as in the begining it doth prepare thee, to be a <hi>veſſel of
wrath.</hi> This was the diſeaſe whereof the whole Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> did
periſh.</p>
                     <p>Doeſt thou ſee thy Brother, one baptized in the name of Chriſt, go on
ſtubbornly in his wicked courſes? thou doſt well to threaten him with the
ſentence of death. Yet limit thy ſpeeches by the Prophets Rule, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 18.
pronounce him not for all this, an <hi>abſolute Reprobate</hi> or irrecoverable veſſel of
wrath: give him not forthwith for dead; but rather uſe double diligence
to prevent his death, and tell him, <hi>If God ſhew mercy upon whom he will ſhew
mercy, if this his VVill be eternally free: it is as free for him yet to ſhew mercy upon
ſuppoſed Caſtawaies, and to harden uncharitable and preſumptuous Phariſecs (for the
preſent manifeſtation of his glory) as it was for him to reject the Jews and chaſe the
Gentiles.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Finally, this <hi>Diviſion,</hi> though we take <hi>Mercy</hi> and <hi>Induration</hi> according to
their <hi>Indefinite,</hi> or loweſt meaſure, is not more univerſally true in reſpect of
the <hi>Innumerable Subjects</hi> or parties unto whom it may fittly be applyed, then
it is in reſpect of the <hi>Time,</hi> wherein it may be applyed to any determinate
Individual Subject, which hath not made as yet, either the <hi>Full Meaſure</hi> of
his iniquitie up to the brim; or his <hi>Election</hi> immutably ſure. Of all and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Perſon and Subject not thus qualifyed, it is univerſally true; <hi>He hath
mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardneth.</hi> In reſpect of
every particular and determinate perſon not thus qualifyed it is univerſally
true; <hi>He hath mercy</hi> when <hi>he will have mercy, and when he will be hardeneth.</hi>
And he hardeneth at no time ſooner then when men (what men ſoever)
are moſt confidently preſumptuous of his mercy,<note place="margin">That this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red is no way prejudicial to the <hi>certainty of ſalvation;</hi> but rather directs us how to make our <hi>Election ſure.</hi>
                        </note> or untimely ſecure of their
perſeverance in faith or continuance in his favour.</p>
                     <p>32. Perhaps the ingenuous, and hitherto indifferent Reader, will here
begin to diſtaſt theſe laſt Admonitions, and for their ſakes, moſt of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutions,
as prejudicial to a commonly received doctrine concerning the
<hi>Certainty of Salvation.</hi> And I muſt confeſſe that upon firſt ſight they may
ſeem ſuſpicious, in that they ſuppoſe our Election to be not only uncertain in
<pb n="3245" facs="tcp:100044:140"/>
reſpect of our apprehenſions, but mutable in its nature. But if it pleaſe him
either to look back into ſome paſſages of the former diſcourſe, or to go
along with me alittle further; I ſhall acquaint him (though not with a ſurer
foundation yet) with a ſtronger frame or ſtructure of his hopes, than he ſhall
ever attain unto by following their Rules, who, I verily think, were fully
aſſured of their own ſalvation, but from other grounds than they have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
to us.</p>
                     <p>Surer foundation can no man lay, than that whereon both parties do
build, to wit, <hi>the abſolute immutabilite of Gods decree or purpoſe.</hi> Now
admitting our apprehenſions of his Will or purpoſe <hi>to call, elect</hi> or <hi>ſave</hi> us,
were infallible: yet he that from theſe foundations would rear up the
Edifice of his faith, after this haſty manner, <hi>[Gods purpoſe to call, elect and
ſave mee, is immutable;</hi> Ergo, <hi>my preſent calling is effectuall, my election
already ſure, and my ſalvation moſt immutable,]</hi> becomes as vain in his ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations,
as if he expected that wals of loom, and rafters of reed covered
with fern, ſhould be able to keep out Gun-ſhot, becauſe ſeated upon an
impregnable Rock.</p>
                     <p>For firſt, who can be longer ignorant of this truth, than it ſhall pleaſe
him to conſider it? That Gods purpoſe and Will is moſt immutable in
reſpect of every object poſſible: that mutabilitie it ſelf, all the changes
and chances of this mortal life, and the immutable ſtate of immortalitie
in the life to come, are a-like immutably decreed by the eternal counſel
of his <hi>immutable Will.</hi> Now if mortalitie and mutabilitie have precedence
of immortalitie, in reſpect of the ſame perſons, by the immutable <hi>Tenor</hi> of
his irreſiſtible decree: can it ſeem any Paradox to ſay? <hi>[That mans Eſtate
whether of</hi> Election <hi>or <hi>Reprobation</hi> is even in this life uſually mutable, before
it come to be Immutable, and that by vertue of the ſame inalterable decree.
Or, That ordinarily there ſhould be in every one of us as true a poſſibility of living
after the fleſh, as of living after the ſpirit: before we becom ſo actually and
compleatly ſpiritual, as utterly to mortifie all luſts and concupiſcences of the fleſh.]</hi>
Untill (then) our mortification be compleat and full, we may not preſume
all poſſibilitie of living after the fleſh to be finally expired and utterly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
in our ſoules. And whether this poſſibilitie can be in this life altogether
ſo little, or truly none, as it ſhall be in the life to come, after our mortal
hopes are ratified by the ſentence of the almighty Judge, I cannot affirm,
if any man peremptorily will deny it; nor will I contend by way of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorie
denial, if it ſhall pleaſe any man upon probable reaſons to
affirm it.</p>
                     <p>33. But if to ſuch as finally periſh, no true or reall poſſibilitie of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance
during the whole courſe of this mortal life, be allotted by the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
irreſiſtible decree; in what true ſenſe can God be ſaid to allow them
a time of repentance? How doth our Apoſtle ſay, that <hi>the bountifulneſſe
of God doth lead</hi> or draw <hi>them to repentance,</hi> if the doore of repentance
be perpetually mured up againſt them by his Irreſiſtible will?</p>
                     <p>If in ſuch as are ſaved, there never were from their birth or Baptiſm
any true or reall poſſibilitie of running the waies of death; the fear of Hell,
or the declaration of Gods juſt judgements (if at any time they truly feare
them) is but a vaine imagination, or groundleſs Phanſie, without any true
cauſe or reall occaſion preſented to them by the immutable decree. Or if
by his providence, they be at any time brought to fear hell, or the ſentence
of everlaſting death: yet hath God uſed theſe but as bug-beares in reſpect
of them, though truly terrible to others. And Bug-heares, when children
<pb n="3246" facs="tcp:100044:141"/>
grow once ſo wiſe as to diſcern them from true terrors, do ſerve their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
to very ſmall purpoſe.</p>
                     <p>For mine own part, albeit I fear not the ſtate of abſolute reprobation,
yet ſo conſcious am I to mine own infirmities, that I would not for all the
hopes, or any joy, or pleaſure which this life can afford, abandon all uſe
of the fear of hell, or torments of the life to come. But whatſoever the
Tenor of my eſtate in mine own apprehenſion heretofore hath been, for
the preſent is, or hereafter may be, I am (and I think ſhall ſo continue)
abſolutely perſwaded, that the abſolute impoſſibilitie, whether of Apoſtaſie
from Faith profeſſed, or of becomeing true and Stedfaſt profeſſors, is the
uſual Succeſſor, as heir by Conqueſt, of mixt poſſibilitie of becoming
as well veſſels of wrath, as veſſels of mercy; <hi>and è contrà.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>34. Upon this reall poſſibilitie of becoming <hi>veſſels of wrath,</hi> doth
our Apoſtle ground thoſe admonitions, <hi>Hebr. 3. 12. 13. Take heed bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
leſt there be in any of you an evil heart of unbeleif, indeparting from the
living God: But exhort one another daily, while it is called to day, leſt any of
you be hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi> And againe, <hi>Chapt. 4. v.</hi> 1.
<hi>Let us therefore fear leſt a promiſe being left us of entering into his Reſt, any
of you ſhould ſeem to come ſhort of it.</hi> Theſe and the like admonitions frequent
in the <hi>Prophets</hi> and the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ſuppoſe the men whom they admoniſh, to
be as yet not abſolutely reprobated, but in a mutable ſtate; or in a ſtate
ſubject to a mutuall poſſibilitie of becoming <hi>veſſels of wrath,</hi> or <hi>veſſels of
mercy;</hi> and by Conſequence, not altogether uncapable of that height of
impietie unto which onely the eternal and immutable decree hath allotted
abſolute impoſſibilitie of repentance, or of ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>Upon the true and reall poſſibilitie of becoming <hi>veſſels of mercy</hi> ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to be awarded by the eternal and Irreſiſtible decree to all partakers
of the word and Sacraments, doth <hi>S. Peter</hi> ground that exhortation, <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,
give diligence to make your calling and election ſure: for if ye do theſe
things, ye ſhall never fall. For ſo an entrance ſhall be miniſtred unto you abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly
in to the everlaſting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Ieſus Chriſt:</hi> 2
<hi>Peter,</hi> 1. 10, 11. The end of this exhortation was to bring his Auditors
unto that full growth in grace and good workes in this life, unto which
abſolute impoſſibilitie of <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> is as irreſiſtibly aſſigned, by the eternal
and immutable decree, as final induration or impoſſibilitie of repentance is
unto the full meaſure of iniquitie.</p>
                     <p>35. In what proportion theſe two contrarie poſſibilities may be mixt in all
or moſt men, before they arrive at the point of abſolute impoſſibilitie either
of <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> or of repentance; we leave it to every mans private conſcience
to gueſſe or examin <hi>groſſo modo,</hi> and to infinite and and eternal wiſdom
exactly and abſolutly to determin. Unto whoſe examination we likewiſe
in fear and Reverence referre it, whether the impoſſibilitie of repentance be
abſolute or equal in all that periſh; or the impoſſibilitie of <hi>Apoſtaſie</hi> be
abſolute and equal in all that are ſaved, at one time or other before they
depart hence: or whether the mutual poſſibilities of becomming <hi>veſſels
of mercy</hi> or <hi>veſſels of wrath,</hi> may not, in ſome degree or other, continue
their combination in ſome men untill the very laſt act or exerciſe of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
life.</p>
                     <p>But unto one and the ſame man untill he come to one of theſe two full
points or periods, God alwaies ſpeakes, (whether by his word preached
or otherwiſe by his peculiar providence) as unto two: becauſe every ſuch man
hath ſomewhat of the fleſh, and ſomewhat of the ſpirit. For men as
<pb n="3247" facs="tcp:100044:141"/>
they are the ſonnes of <hi>Adam</hi> are carnal; and Gods words are all ſpiritual,
and alwaies leave ſome print or touch behind them, whereby the ſoul,
in ſome degree or other, is preſently either hardned, or preſently mollified; or
at leaſt diſpoſed to mollification or induration. Continual or frequent
calcitration againſt the edge of this fierie ſword breeds a <hi>Callum</hi> or compleat
<hi>hardneſſe;</hi> or (as the Apoſtle ſpeakes) it <hi>ſeares the conſcience.</hi> But where
it entreth, it cauſeth the heart to melt, and makes way for abundant mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie
to follow after.</p>
                     <p>36. Men as yet not come to a fulneſſe either of iniquitie, or of growth
of Faith, are but children in Chriſt: and God ſpeaks to his children, while
they are children, as wiſe and loving parents do to theirs. Now if a kind
loving father ſhould ſay to one of his ſonnes, whom he had often taken play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the wag, <hi>Thou ſhalt never have pennie of what is mine;</hi> and to another
whom he obſerved to follow his book or other good exerciſes well pleaſing
to him, <hi>Thou ſhalt be mine heire:</hi> a man of diſcretion would not conſtrue his
words (though affectionately uttered) in ſuch a ſtrict ſenſe, as Lawyers
would do the like Clauſes of his laſt Will and Teſtament; but rather
interpret his meaning thus; that both continuing in their contrary courſes,
the one ſhould be diſinherited, and the other made heire. Though God
by an Angell or voice from heaven ſhould ſpeake to one man at his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<hi>Thou ſhalt be ſaved;</hi> and to another at the ſame time blaſpheming,
<hi>Thou ſhalt be damned:</hi> his ſpeeches to the one were to be taken as a good en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to go forward in his ſervice; his ſpeeches to the other, as a
faire warning to deſiſt from evill: and not as ratifications of immutabilitie
in either courſe, not as irrevocable ſentences of ſalvation or damnation in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of their individual perſons, but in reſpect of their preſent qualifications
in whomſoever conſtantly continued. <hi>Saul</hi> the Perſecutor was a reprobate,
or <hi>veſſel of wrath:</hi> but <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, a Saint of God, a <hi>choſen veſſell.</hi> It is
univerſally true; <hi>The ſeed of Abraham or Iſrael</hi> was Gods people: and yet
it is true, that the Jews (though the ſeed of <hi>Abraham</hi> and ſonnes of <hi>Iſrael</hi>)
were not partakers of the promiſe made to <hi>Abraham.</hi> For they became
thoſe <hi>Idumaeans,</hi> thoſe <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Egyptians,</hi> againſt whom Gods
Prophets had ſo often threatned his judgements, whom they themſelves
had excluded from Gods temple. One principall cauſe of their miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age
was their ignorance of the <hi>Prophetical language,</hi> whoſe threats or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes
are alwayes immediately terminated, not to mens <hi>perſons,</hi> but to their
<hi>qualifications.</hi> In their <hi>Dialect,</hi> onely true <hi>Confeſſors</hi> are truly <hi>Jewes;</hi> every
<hi>hypocrite</hi> or <hi>backeſlider</hi> is a <hi>Gentile,</hi> an <hi>Idumaean,</hi> a <hi>Philiſtine.</hi> None to whom
God hath ſpoken by his prophets, were by birth ſuch obdurate <hi>Philiſtines,</hi>
as had no poſſibilitie of becomming <hi>Iſraelites</hi> or true <hi>Confeſſors.</hi> The chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not by nature ſo Undegenerate ſonnes of <hi>Abraham</hi>
as to be without all poſſibilitie of becomming <hi>Amorites.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>37. The true ſcantling of our Apoſtles up-ſhot, <hi>[He will have mercy upon
whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardneth,]</hi> rightly taken, reacheth
exactly to theſe points following, and no farther.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, to admoniſh theſe <hi>Iewes</hi> by Gods judgements on <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> not to
ſtrive with their Maker, not to neglecte the warnings of their peace, upon
preſumption that they were <hi>veſſels</hi> of <hi>mercy</hi> by inheritance: ſeeing they
could not pretend any priviledge able to exempt them from Gods general
juriſdiction of <hi>hardning whom he would,</hi> (as well of the ſonnes of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
as of the <hi>Aegyptians,)</hi> or of diverting thoſe beames of glory which had
ſhined on them, upon ſome other nation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="3248" facs="tcp:100044:142"/>
It, ſecondly, reacheth to us <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and forewarnes all and every one of
us, by Gods fearefull judgements upon theſe <hi>Jewes,</hi> not to tie the immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
of His Decree for <hi>Election</hi> unto any hereditarie, amiable, national
diſpoſition, much leſs unto the <hi>Individual entities</hi> of our perſons, as if it were
like a chain of Adamant to draw us out of the womb into the grave out of the
grave into Paradiſe. Our Apoſtle makes a quite contrarie <hi>Vſe</hi> of this
<hi>Doctrine;</hi> his <hi>diviſion</hi> of <hi>hardening</hi> and <hi>ſhewing mercy</hi> holds true (as hath
been declared) in one and the ſame perſon; and every one of us, for this
reaſon, is bound alwayes to faſten one eye as ſtedfaſtly upon <hi>Gods ſeveritie</hi>
towards the <hi>Jew,</hi> as we do the other upon the <hi>riches of his glorie and mercy</hi>
towards our ſelves. <hi>For if he ſpared not the natural branches, let us take heed
left he alſo ſpare not us,</hi> who have been hitherto the <hi>Flower</hi> and <hi>Bud</hi> of the
<hi>Gentiles. Behold therefore the goodneſs and ſeveritie of God: on them which fell, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veritie;
but towards thee, goodneſſe, if thou continue in his goodneſſe: otherwiſe
thou alſo ſhalt be cut off. And they alſo, if they bide not ſtill in unbeleife, ſhall
bee grafted in: for God is able to graft them in againe.</hi> The one aſpect breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<hi>feare,</hi> the other bringeth forth <hi>hope:</hi> and in the right counterpoiſe of <hi>hope</hi>
and <hi>feare</hi> conſiſts that uprightneſs of minde and equabilitie of affections, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which no man can direct his courſe aright unto the <hi>Land of promiſe.</hi> This
manifeſtation of Gods mercy to one people or other, after a kinde of equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent
viciſſitude perpetuated from the like revolution of his ſeveritie to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
others, was the object of that profoundly divine contemplation, out
of which our Apoſtle awaking, as out of a pleaſant ſleep, cryes out, <hi>O the
depth of the riches both of the wiſdome and knowledge of God! how unſearchable are
his judgements, and his waies paſt finding out? Rom.</hi> 11. 33.</p>
                     <p>38. He that deſires to have his heart filled with ſuch a meaſure of joyfull
admiration as will ſeek a vent in theſe or the like unaffected ſerious excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations,
muſt feed his thoughts with contemplation of <hi>divine attributes;</hi>
ſpecially with thoſe of <hi>infinite duration or eternitie, of infinite wiſdom, of infinite
goodneſſe</hi> and <hi>love</hi> to man. In all which I have adventured to tread a path for
others to correct or follow upon triall; being aſſured of this, that without
the knowledge of theſe generalities, nothing can be ſaid to any purpoſe in
the particulars thus farre proſecuted, or in the like to bee proſecuted more
at large, when God ſhall grant leaſure and opportunitie.</p>
                     <p>39. Theſe preſent diſquiſitions (though ſeeming curious, as the reſolution
is truly difficult) have a vulgar and immediate uſe; yet not ſo vulgarly plain
or common to all, as profitable to every particular Chriſtian not fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
of the certainty of his ſalvation.</p>
                     <p>The ſpeciall aime of my meditations in this argument is, firſt, to deterre
my ſelf and others from all evill wayes whatſoever; but eſpecially from
thoſe peculiar and more dangerous ſinnes, which make up the full meaſure
of iniquitie with greateſt ſpeed: Secondly, to encourage mine owne ſoule
and others with it, to accompliſh thoſe courſes unto which the immutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
or abſolute certaintie of <hi>election</hi> it ſelf (which muſt in order of nature
and time goe before our infallible apprehenſions of it) is inevitably predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
by the eternal and irreſiſtible decree.</p>
                     <p>Theſe exhortations are more fit for popular ſermons, than ſuch points
as hitherto have been diſcuſſed: whoſe diſcuſſion nevertheleſſe hath ſeemed
unto me very expedient, as well for warranting the particular uſes which
I purpoſe (if God permit) to make out of the chapters following, as for
giving ſuch ſatisfaction to my beſt friends as God hath enabled me to give
my ſelf, concerning the Apoſtles intent and meaning in this ninth chapter.</p>

40. If what I have ſaid ſhall happen to fall into any mans hands, which
hath a <hi>logical</hi> head, and beares a friendly heart to truth (though otherwiſe no
friend to me: yet) I preſume he will not be ſo uncharitable towards me, as to
ſuſpect that I have intended theſe premiſſes to inferre any ſuch diſtaſtful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
as theſe; <hi>That Election ſhould be ex fide aut operibus praeviſis, for our
faith or workes ſakes; That any man ſhould be more than meerly paſsive in his firſt
converſion; That the working of ſaving grace might be reſiſted;</hi> or laſtly, <hi>That
in man before his converſion, there ſhould be any ſpark of free will remaining, ſave
only to do evill.</hi> Whoſoever will grant me theſe two Propoſitions, <hi>That the
unregenerate man hath a true freedom of will in doing evill,]</hi> and <hi>[The eternal
Creator a freedom of will in doing good:]</hi> I will engage my ſelf to give him full
ſatisfaction, that no difference betwixt <hi>Reformed Churches</hi> concerning <hi>Praedeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>
or <hi>Reprobation,</hi> is more then verbal, or hath any other foundation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
the ambiguitie of unexplicated termes. The errors on all ſides grow
only from pardonable miſtakings, not ſo much of truth it ſelf, as of her

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here is no Argument in Divinitie, wherein every Soul that earneſtly
ſeeks Salvation (or the avoidance of damnation,) ought in reaſon, to
be more deſirous of ſatiſfaction, than in the point of of <hi>Eternal Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,</hi>
and <hi>Reprobation.</hi> Nor are Scholaſtick diſputes concerning
theſe Points in themſelves ſo dangerous, as they are made by ſuch as
are more apt to abett Contentions ſett on foot, than able rightly to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine,
whence the quarrel firſt began, upon what termes it ſtands, or
how it may fitly be compoſed. In ſearching out the true ſenſe and meaning of whatſoever
it hath pleaſed God to reveal, there can be no offence: in the manner of the ſearch we often of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend.
Diligence and accurate pains are alwaies commendable, as in every other Subject, ſo
in this, wherein <hi>Curioſitie</hi> is only dangerous: Howbeit whereſoever Curioſitie of ſearch is
dangerous, peremptorie Reſolutions (whether negative or affirmative) muſt needs be pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
ſeeing ſuſpenſion of Aſſent in difficult or controverſed Caſes, is a propertie no leſs Eſſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
to true Faith, than firm adherence to divine truth known and acknowledged. And if the
blame were beſtowed, in that proportion it hath been deſerved, amongst the ſeveral Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
upon the Scriptures prefixed to theſe diſcuſſions: the heavieſt burden would lye, not upon
ſuch as make new Queries, but upon ſuch as have taken upon them to give abſolute Determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations
without accurate ſearch of the Apoſtles meaning: prepoſterouſly ſeeking to compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
what they ſhould admire, and endeavouring to ſtirre up affected admiration of that
which every Novice might fully comprehend, were their Reſolutions in this Argument as
Orthodoxal, as they are peremptorie.</p>
                  <p>The end of theſe preſent Queries is to find out a middle way how to maintain ſome principal
Concluſions of Reformed Churches (ſpecially concerning the <hi>Servitude of mans Will;</hi> the
<hi>Nullitie of merits</hi> or of Works foreſeen, and the <hi>Irreſiſtible efficacie of ſaving Grace:</hi>) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
aſſociation of thoſe <hi>Rigid Premiſſes</hi> which latter ages have invented for their maintenance,
as <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> of old did <hi>Epicycles,</hi> and <hi>Copernicus</hi> of late the <hi>motion of the Earth</hi> for
ſalving their Coeleſtial <hi>Phaenomena.</hi> To pick quarrels with <hi>Antecedents</hi> of good uſe,
whereas the fault lies only in the <hi>Inference,</hi> is a fault too common to Controverſie-writers in
every age. And thus to ſpight an erroneous <hi>Concluſion,</hi> the foundations of many uſeful
truths are often overthrown, and new falſe <hi>Principles</hi> brought in their place, which will bring
forth dangerous errors by faultleſſe Conſequences.</p>
                  <p>I have often been enforced to ſeaſon my retired thoughts with ſighs or tears, whiles I beheld the
factious oppoſitions of forraign Reformed Churches abetted, animated, and propagated by men
whom God had placed as Byſtanders or unpartial Vmpires; and bleſſed with all opportunities
of making peace amongſt others, ſo they themſelves had been the ſons of peace. The parties here
meant were Engliſh Divines, men freed by Gods eſpecial providence from all vicinitie of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
adverſary or ſuch politick provocations as their forraign brethren were often miſled with.
Some, or rather a great many, of no mean note have held it as a matter of conſcience, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
it as a choice fruit of zeal, to preſſe thoſe <hi>Rigid Opinions</hi> upon their Auditors which
the firſt Authors of them would never have conceived or quickly would have abandoned if
they could with ſafe conſcience have ſubſcribed unto the <hi>Engliſh Leitourgie.</hi> And in very
<pb n="3251" facs="tcp:100044:143"/>
truth this peculiar Symptom of the crazed and ill-tempered Presbyterie (I mean zealous ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents
to <hi>Rigid Tenents of Reprobation)</hi> hath been been an eſpecial motive to withdraw
manie hands and pens from ſubſcription to our <hi>Common Prayer-book</hi> or <hi>book of Homilies.</hi>
It was a ſubject of much ſadder contemplation to ſee (as who ſees not that hath not reſolved
to wink at the ſoloeciſms of his good friends?) manie Divines, well fitted and engaged for bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
imployments, become anxious ſollicitors for the admiſſion or rather intruſion of that very er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror
into Reformed Churches, whoſe extirpation in the Synogogue, the prevention of whoſe propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
throughout the Churches of the Gentiles by him planted, was a great part of his labours
who in ſacred labours, was more plentiful than any, than all his fellow Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>The attempt for this intruſion found no ſuch furtherance from the pretended Title of <hi>Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Orthodoxal Truth</hi> as from preſent oppoſition to modern errors; As if the parties of whom
I ſpeak, had held it an Aphoriſm of ſacred Policie, to entertain any Heatheniſh, Jewiſh or
Turkiſh Fugitives, able to do ſervice againſt the <hi>Lutheran.</hi> That ſundrie Writers of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
note and name than here to be named by me, have (out of oppoſition to the <hi>Lutheran</hi>) given
more ſuſpition of concurrence with the Stoick, the Modern Turk, or Jews that lived in our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles
time, than the <hi>Lutheran</hi> doth of any concurrence with the <hi>Papiſt</hi> or other Heretick
whatſoever: I ſhall be able to inform him that will friendlie and privately debate this ſeeming
<hi>Paradox</hi> with me, whether by writing or by word of mouth. But, as the world now is ſet,
openly and publickly to confront a countenanced error, would breed greater diſſention between
brethren in profeſſion and affection, then the unſeaſonable publication of truth, (ſpecially by ſo
mean a meſſenger of truth as my ſelf) could recompence:</p>
                  <q>Dum furor in curſu eſt currenti cede furori.</q>
                  <p>It is one thing to give the way unto ſuch fierce oppoſitions as daily meet us, and another to
be carryed headlong with them or to ſollow them, as their Patrons too often follow Princes
Courts, that is, as we ſay, afarre off.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt I was an Artiſt I liked the Old Preſcript well [<hi>Loquendum cum multis, Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophandum
cum paucis.</hi>] The medicine a little corrected, is not much amiſſe in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie.
[<hi>Theologizandum cum paucis, non loquendum contra multos</hi>] unleſs it be unto
ſome few, and thoſe no parts of the multitude or Vulgar ſort, either for judgment or affection.
Amongst my choiſest acquaintance and moſt reſpected friends, I had no choice left, in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition
with your ſelves, to whom in all congruitie, I rather ought, or more ſafely might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate,
what I conceive of this or other like points of Divinitie more neceſſary to be enquired
into by ſuch as are intelligently ingenious, than expedient to be publiſhed or communicated
without diſtinction of Times and Perſons. For of my choiceſt meditations heretofore, either
publiſhed or privately peruſed, I have ever liked the impreſſion much better, whileſt I lookt
upon it in your diſpoſition and converſation, than whileſt I read it in mine own papers, or from
the Preſs. <hi>Vos eſtis Epiſtola mea:</hi> of all my labours in the Miniſterie I have reapt no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
like to this: That it hath pleaſed God to uſe me ſometimes as a Waterer of thoſe precious
ſeeds unto which he himſelf hath given plentiful encreaſe: and to with-hold any thing, that
my conſcience tels me may yeild wholeſome nouriſhment, (though but rudely and homely dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
(as this ſmall Preſent is) unto thoſe ſacred Plants which the right hand of our heavenly
Father hath planted in your breſts, were to robb my ſelf of my chiefeſt joy. Thus I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured
in a Caſe (as it is commonly apprehended) of great danger to be your Taſter, being
more willing (as I know you are perſwaded of me) to drink the deadlieſt bodily poiſon that
could be miniſtred unto me, than willingly to infect your ſouls with any poyſonous doctrine.
Howbeit I profer not theſe brief Receipts as Mountebanks do their druggs, or Tradeſmen
their waves upon Oath or confident Aſſeverations, but rather referr them to the farther
trial of your leſs partial more judicious taſt, faithfully promiſing on my part all readineſs to

bold to ſtyle them, (though ſome interpreters make them no more then <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors,</hi>
or unhandſom <hi>Rhetorical Tropes)</hi> becauſe the matters contained in
them are expreſſd in <hi>Divine Allegories,</hi> which (as hath been obſerved before)
do herein farre exceed Allegories meerely Rhetorical or concerning matters
Secular, in that they alwayes afford <hi>Concludent Proof,</hi> that is, true Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Real Proportions. The Principal <hi>Termes</hi> or Real <hi>Subjects of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions</hi>
in the 8, and ninth chapters of this Epiſtle are theſe following; <hi>The
Earthly or mundan Tabernacle, and the Coeleſtial; The Two Sanctuaries contein'd
in the Earthly Tabernacle, and the Two Heavenly Sanctuaries which in proportion
anſwer to them: The ſeveral manner of Dedication or Conſecration of all theſe
Sanctuaries: The ſeveral manner or Rites uſed in the Dedication of all theſe Sanct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaries:

                  </p>

in the Temple of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> projected by <hi>David</hi> but finiſhed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated
by <hi>Salomon</hi> his ſon, there were <hi>Two Sanctuaries</hi> or <hi>Holy Places: One,</hi>
into which the Ordinary Prieſts were by precept to enter every day; The
<hi>Other</hi> into which it was lawful for none ſave for the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> alone to
enter, and that but <hi>Once every Year.</hi> Now this earthly or mundane Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
(which contained theſe two Sanctuaries) being erected by Gods
ſpecial Command unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> according to the Patern which had been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
him in the mount; it is a clear Caſe from our <hi>Apoſtles</hi> Authority and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of <hi>Moſes,</hi> that, <hi>Both theſe Sanctuaries</hi> or Holy Places made with
hands, were but <hi>Types</hi> or ſhaddowes of two Sanctuaries, not made with
hand but prepared or Created by God himſelf in the Heavens. <hi>Every
High Prieſt is ordained to offer gifts and ſacrifices, wherefore it is of neceſſitie
that this Prieſt have ſomwhat alſo to offer; For if he were on earth he ſhould
not be a Prieſt, ſeing that there are Prieſts that offer Gifts according to the Law:

who ſerve unto the example and ſhaddow of Heavenly things, as Moſes was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhed
of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle. For See (ſaith he)
that thou make all things according to the Patern ſhewed to thee in the mount.</hi> Heb.
8. 3. 4. 5. Theſe words contain a <hi>Fundamental Principle,</hi> which, were it
exactly ſurveyed; and a <hi>Profound Myſterie,</hi> which, were it <hi>well ſounded</hi>
would guide us to the diſcovery of many more throughout this Epiſtle, and

                  <p>5. <hi>To give ſome Hints unto the One, and directions unto the Other:
The</hi> heavenly Sanctuary <hi>repreſented by the</hi> moſt Holy place <hi>(or that which
they call</hi> Sanctum Sanctorum) <hi>in the earthly Tabernacle or material Temple,
as is evident from our Apoſtle, Chap. 1. Was that heavenly Sanctuary
whereunto our High Prieſt Chriſt Jeſus is entred</hi> Once for all, <hi>and wherein
he continually exerciſeth his</hi> Everlaſting Prieſt-hood. And after the ſecond
Vail, (was) the Tabernacle which is called the Holieſt of all, which had the golden
Cenſer and the Ark of the Covenant overlayed round about with gold, wherein
was the golden pot that had manna, and Aarons rod that budded, and the Tables
of the Covenant, and over it the Cherubims of Glorie ſhaddowing the Mercie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeat:
of which we cannot now ſpeak particularly. Now when theſe things were
thus ord<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ined, the Prieſt went alwayes into the firſt Tabernacle, accompliſhing the
ſervice of God, but into the ſecond went the High-Prieſt alone once every year,
not without bloud, which he offered for himſelf and for the errors of the people.
The Holy Ghoſt this ſignifying that the way into the Holieſt of all was not yet made
manifeſt <hi>(that is, not yet opened, but cloſe ſhut)</hi> while as the firſt Tabernacle
was yet ſtanding. Heb. 9. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.</p>
                  <p>6 But unto whom was the way into the <hi>Moſt Holy Place</hi> ſo ſhut? unto
men only as unto <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> or unto the ſoules of Patriarches, of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,

ſelf before our Saviour's Aſcenſion thither? I make no Queſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion
but they were eſtated in ſome <hi>Bliſſefull heavenly Manſion.</hi> For it is not
to be ſuſpected that <hi>Abraham</hi> from the day of his death was not as near unto
the throne of Majeſtie, and in a place of as great Happineſs as the Penitent
Malefactors ſoule was admitted into, ſome few howers after his torments
upon the Croſs were ended. Now the place whereunto he was in ſoul admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

which <hi>Adam</hi> loſt; much leſs any Region under the Earth, or Concavitie in

<hi>That,</hi> into which <hi>Adam,</hi> if he had not forfeited his eſtate in the
firſt <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> ſhould in good time, it may be, have been tranſlated in Body.
That <hi>Abraham</hi> was in a place of <hi>Bliſſe,</hi> and of reward or Recompence accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the righteouſneſs of his ways, is clear from the Parable of <hi>Lazarus,</hi>
whoſe ſoule was carryed by the <hi>Angels,</hi> not into any <hi>Subterraneal Vault</hi> (of
which or like places the holy <hi>Angels</hi> are no officers or attendants) but into

] May be
rendred thus, that <hi>the ſoul of Lazarus was carried or wafted by the Angels into
the Bay of Abraham,</hi> that is, into ſome one of thoſe heavenly places wherein
the ſoules of <hi>Abraham</hi> and other righteous men did reſt, as ſhips in a ſafe Bay
or Harbor, freed from all Dangers of wind and other annoyances, expecting
time or opportunitie to arrive or to be tranſported into the <hi>Royal Seat</hi> or Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
of bleſſedneſſe, (which, as hath been ſaid) was <hi>not open</hi> or paſſable until
the <hi>King of glorie</hi> did enter into it. So that <hi>Abraham</hi> and many others were
bleſſed in ſoule in thoſe heavenly Harbors into which they were wafted or
ſafely conducted by the <hi>Angels,</hi> but did not, but poſſibly could not, receive
the accompliſhment of ſuch bliſs, as the humane ſanctified ſoul, though ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
from the body is capable of, untill the Son of God did enter into
the <hi>holy place</hi> not made with hands; that is, not till his <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> both in Body

                  <p>2. The truth of this laſt Aſſertion <hi>[Albeit Abraham were in a bleſſed Haven:
yet the Anchor of his Hopes did not approach the true Seat of Bliſs before our Saviours

have as an anchor of the ſoule both ſure and ſtedfaſt (<gap reason="foreign">

which entreth into that within the Vail, whither the fore-runner is for us entred,
even Jeſus, made an high Prieſt for ever after the order of Melchizedeck.</hi> As
alſo from another place much miſtaken by ſome of the <hi>Ancients</hi> and not well
tranſlated by many modern Interpreters, Heb. 11. 39, 40. <hi>All theſe</hi> (of
which number <hi>Enoch, Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Moſes</hi> were three principal ones) <hi>having
obtained A Good Report through Faith received not the promiſe, God having provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
ſome better thing for us that they without us ſhould not be made perfect.</hi> That is,
ſhould not be <hi>Conſecrated</hi> to be <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Prieſts,</hi> before ſuch of the faithful
as lived at the time of our Saviours Aſcenſion were <hi>Conſecrated</hi> with them.
And in this ſenſe that of <hi>St. Ambroſe</hi> (with whoſe Expreſſions of this <hi>Myſterie</hi>
many in our times have been altogether cauſeleſly much offended) <hi>[when
thou hadest overcome the ſharpneſs of death thou dideſt open the kingdom of heaven
to all Believers,]</hi> ought to be taken. Nothing can be more plain or more
Concludently proved from our Saviours own words and his Apoſtles Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments

3. To dilate further upon this Point for this Preſent I dare not, leſt I
ſhould loſe my way, or forget to return to the other Parallel propoſed, to
wit, <hi>[What heavenly Manſion or Sanctuary the firſt Part of the earthly Tabernacle, or
Court, whereinto the ordinary Prieſts went every day, did repreſent or foreſhaddow?]</hi>
I ſhall not treſpaſs againſt any <hi>Article of Faith,</hi> or Rule of interpreting Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
nor I hope offend any ingenuous Conſcience, by delivering my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in a Point wherein the Scripture (as I conceive) is ſilent, or which can
neither be enforced upon Us as any part of Chriſtian Belief, nor be refuted
by any Rule of Faith. To my apprehenſion of our Apoſtles meaning, Heb.
8. ver. 5. <hi>That place</hi> or Manſion in the heavenly Tabernacle wherein <hi>Abraham,
Lazarus</hi> &amp;c. did reſt, before <hi>The Kingdom of heaven</hi> was ſet <hi>open to all Beleivers,</hi>
was That Place or Court which <hi>Atrium Sacerdotum,</hi> the Court of the Prieſts
in the firſt Tabernacle or in Salomons Temple, did Picture out unto us. Or,
if the ſoules of the Faithful were not admitted into <hi>That Place</hi> before Chriſts
death: we cannot allot a Lower or Outermer Manſion in heaven it ſelf
than that, which <hi>Atrium Congregation is,</hi> that is, the Court of the Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in Salomons Temple, whereinto the Congregation of Iſrael which were
no Prieſts were admitted and taught by the Prieſts, did repreſent. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
it be, <hi>That heavenly Manſion</hi> or Sanctuary, which in proportion truly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
to the Sanctuary or Court of Prieſts in the material Temple, was no
<hi>ſuch happy Seat of Bliſs, before Christs Death, as it was made by it.</hi> For by his
<hi>Bloud</hi> it was finally <hi>Conſecrated</hi> or dedicated to be what now it is, <hi>a True Temple,</hi>
which was the Second Parallel propoſed.</p>

Neither was the firſt Teſtament dedicated without Bloud. For when
Moſes had ſpoken every Praecept to all the People according to the Law;
he took the bloud of Calves, and of Goates, with water, and Scarlet wooll, and Hyſſop,
and ſprinkled both the Book and all the people, ſaying, This is the bloud of the Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
which God hath enjoined unto you. Moreover he ſprinkled with bloud both
the Tabernac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

Law purged with Bloud, and without ſhedding of bloud is no Remiſſion, Ver. 18, 19,
20, 21, 22. <hi>All this he ſpeakes, according to the plain</hi> Litteral Senſe <hi>of the
Law, concerning the Purifying or Conſecrating of the Earthly Tabernacle
with its Veſſels or Implements. The</hi> Myſtical Senſe <hi>or meaning of the</hi> Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of Fact <hi>or Practiſes performed by</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>when they conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the firſt Tabernacle with the</hi> bloud of Bullocks and Goates, <hi>&amp;c. is litterally
explained unto us by this our</hi> Apoſtle <hi>in the verſes following.</hi> It was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
neceſſary that the patterns of things in the heavens ſhould be purifyed with theſe,
but the heavenly things themſelves with better ſacrifices than theſe, ver. 23. <hi>Theſe
words admit no</hi> Metaphors <hi>or</hi> Tropes, <hi>but have their proper and</hi> Real Logical
<pb n="3258" facs="tcp:100044:147"/>
Senſe. <hi>The Argument is moſt punctually Concludent;</hi> [The Similitude or
paterns of heavenly things were purified with bloud: therefore the heavenly things
themſelves, that is, the Caeleſtial Tabernacles were to be purged and conſecrated with
the bloud of Chriſt our high Prieſt which is now entred into them for our Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and final Redemption.] <hi>To inquire what ſhould become of all our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours
bloud whether ſhed in his Agonie or upon the Croſs, will ſeem I know</hi>
A Curious Queſtion, <hi>ſpecially to ſlothful Students in Divinitie. On the other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,
it would argue a drowſie Fancie either voluntarily to imagine, or to be
by others perſwaded,</hi> That his moſt Precious bloud <hi>being ſhed in ſuch abundance
ſhould be like water ſpilt upon the ground, either ſwallowed up by the dry
earth, or mingled with duſt, or diſperſed by the heat of the Sun and reſolved
into vapours. Seeing every drop of it was truly</hi> The bloud of God: <hi>It can be
no Sin to ſuppoſe, nay to believe, that</hi> All of it was by his death, made, as his
Body now is, Immortal; <hi>that</hi> All of it was preſerved entire and ſincere, and brought
either by his own immediate power, or by the Miniſtery of his holy Angels into thoſe
heavenly Sanctuaries, which were to be CONSECRATED by it, to be the Seats
or Manſions of everlaſting bliſs unto all true Believers, and thus brought in at the
time of his Entrance into Paradiſe in ſoule, <hi>though not in Body, which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
after he had commended his Spirit unto his heavenly Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>2. If unto all that hath been ſaid in this Argument, I ſhould further adde,
That the moſt precious bloud of the Son of God which was ſhed for the
Ranſom of our Sins in the <hi>Garden</hi> or upon the <hi>Croſs,</hi> and brought into the
Celeſtial Tabernacle upon his death (whether reunited to his Glorified Body
or glorified in it ſelf and preſerved apart from his body) doth ſtill retain an
everlaſting Efficacy for the daily Purifying of our hearts and working Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
in us; I preſume the Intelligent or ingenuous Reader will interpret
this <hi>Aſſertion</hi> rather for a <hi>Point of ſpeculation,</hi> not much thought upon by
others, than any <hi>Paradox</hi> or <hi>Heterodoxal Doctrine</hi> of my own Invention. But
of the true Vertual preſence, or Real Operation, of the Body and Bloud of
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt upon our Soules, in ſo great diſtance as is between
the moſt high and moſt holy Celeſtial Sanctuary and theſe material Temples
here on earth, wherein we Celebrate and Solemnize the memorie of his
Death and paſſion, more punctually and more fully, if God ſhall be pleaſed
to give leave,<note place="margin">In the 11. Book.</note> hereafter. All which I have here affirmed or intimated will
uncontrollably follow from our Apoſtles Doctrine in this Epiſtle, and from
other Paſſages of his Fellow Apoſtles. To begin with that of Heb. 9. 11 &amp;c.
<hi>Chriſt being come an High Prieſt of good things to come, by a greater and more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Tabernacle not made with hands, that is to ſay, not of this building; neither by
the bloud of Goates and Calves, but by his own bloud, he entred in once into the holy
place, having obtained eternal redemption for us. For if the bloud of Buls and of
Goats and of the aſhes of an heifer ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctifieth to the purging
of the fleſh; How much more ſhall the bloud of Chriſt, who through the Eternal Spirit
offered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your conſcience from dead works to ſerve
the living God?</hi> In this paſſage we have the true <hi>Myſtical</hi> or <hi>Prophetical Senſe</hi>

Hebrews 9 13, 14. cannot in this life be truely ſounded. And
before I can ſurvey the <hi>Surface of the Parallel</hi> intended by our Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,
I muſt endeavour to charm the Tongues and Pens of ſome ſawcie
<hi>Criticks</hi> in theſe laſt Ages: Such for the moſt part are meere <hi>Grammarians,</hi>
or men in whom Grammatical skill is too predominant. For of this
Light kind of Learning that of our Apoſtle <hi>Scientia inſlat,</hi> as <hi>Ludovicus Vives</hi>
ſomewhere well obſerves, is moſt punctually or peculiarly true. And the
man whoſe <hi>Brain</hi> is full of this skill, and whoſe <hi>Breaſt</hi> is emptie of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
or other ſolid and ingenuous Literature, is like a Pinnace ballaſted

And if this meer Verbal skil be matched with ſome ſleight Diale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical
Termes, as with <hi>Second Notions</hi> or <hi>Dichotomies,</hi> theſe ſerve as En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines

they admit only ſome <hi>Difference,</hi> no way oppoſite but ſubordinate, or
truely <hi>Concordant.</hi> Some of this Crue in the Romiſh Church (with whom
I dare not avow that None in the Reformed Churches are participant,) have
been ſo bold as to impeach the Author of this Divine Epiſtle (if not dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly,
yet by Neceſſary Implication) either of Ignorance in the Hebrew
Dialect, or of ſuch fancies or delight to play with words, as have been
too frequent in theſe Later Ages. For ſo they ſay that <hi>St. Paul</hi> (or who

Creature endued with Senſe,</hi> and, A man or <hi>Senſitive Creature endued with

ſenſe. The Connexion between theſe two words which ſome Criticks
have ſet at Variance, to wit, between a <hi>Covenant</hi> and a <hi>Teſtament,</hi> is altogether

for albeit every <hi>Covenant</hi> be not truely and formally a <hi>Teſtament,</hi> yet every
<hi>Teſtament</hi> truely ſo called, eſſentially is or includes a true and proper <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi>
So that one and the ſame word <hi>[Berith]</hi> in ſome places of the old
Teſtament imports no more than the <hi>Genus</hi> or General ſignification, to wit,
a <hi>Covenant:</hi> In other places it neceſſarily imports a <hi>Teſtamental Covenant,</hi>
and muſt be rendred, as the Apoſtle here doth, by <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is a <hi>Laſt Will
or Valid Teſtament.</hi> Our bleſſed Lord and Saviour (I beleive, and thoſe
which impeach our Apoſtle in this place will not, I hope, deny) did
underſtand the meaning of the Hebrew <hi>[Berith]</hi> as it is uſed in that <hi>Great
Covenant</hi> with the Iſraelites (whereof <hi>Moſes</hi> by Gods appointement was the
mediator) Much better then any modern Grammarian Critick does. Now
our Saviour inſtructs us that the <hi>Covenant,</hi> made by <hi>Moſes</hi> betwixt God and
the Iſraelites, was a true and proper <hi>Teſtament. This Cup</hi> (ſaith he in the
Inſtitution of the new Covenant) <hi>is the new Teſtament in my blood, which is
ſhed for you.</hi> And if this <hi>new Covenant</hi> (as <hi>Ieremie</hi> inſtyles it) were truely
and properly a <hi>Teſtament:</hi> then queſtionleſs the <hi>old Covenant</hi> which God made
with his people in the Inſtitution of the Paſſeover, and renewed by <hi>Moſes</hi>
in the wilderneſs, was a <hi>Teſtament</hi> truely and properly ſo called, and ought
to be tranſlated by the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. All the Covenants which God made
with his people whether concerning the Bleſſings of this life, or of the life
to come were but Introductions, Parcels, or Appendices unto the old and
new Teſtaments.</p>
                  <p>3. Wherein then doth a <hi>Teſtament</hi> properly ſo called, exceed a naked
<hi>Covenant?</hi> There may be, and uſually are, many <hi>Covenants</hi> wherein there
is no Free <hi>Donation</hi> of either partie Covenanting, but a mutual Reddition
of <hi>Quid pro Quo,</hi> or (as ſome Civilians ſpeak) <hi>Ratio datiet accepti:</hi> And
ſuch a Covenant or Act of <hi>Commutative Juſtice,</hi> cannot properly be conceived
betwixt God and man or other creature: None of which are able to give their
Creator any thing which was not his own before, or which was not received
from him by <hi>Free Gift.</hi> Every <hi>Laſt Will</hi> or <hi>Teſtament</hi> includes or preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth
a <hi>Free Donation</hi> of ſome Goods or Lands &amp;c. by the Teſtator, though
often times upon <hi>Covenant</hi> or ſubſequent Condition of Executing or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
the <hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Teſtament:</hi> otherwiſe the Legatee, or Executor, may
forfeit his Eſtate or Intereſt in the Goods freely Bequeath'd unto him. And
of this nature are both the old and new <hi>Teſtaments.</hi> Neither of them was
<hi>Abſolute</hi> in reſpect of all that had Intereſt in the Bleſſings be queath'd; which,
howſoever they were moſt freely bequeath'd, did tie ſuch as had Intereſt in
them unto performance of ſuch <hi>Conditions,</hi> as being neglected or contemned
by them, might deprive them of the Inheritance or Bleſſings bequeath'd.
The Bleſſings bequeathed by <hi>Moſes</hi> (Gods Embaſſador both to <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and
to his people: or, as the Apoſtle inſtyles him, <hi>the Mediator of the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment)</hi>
were <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Deliverance of the ſonnes of Jacob from <hi>Aegypt;
Secondly</hi> the inheritance of the Land of <hi>Canaan.</hi> The Bleſſings, bequeathed
<pb n="3261" facs="tcp:100044:148"/>
by the <hi>Mediator of the new Teſtament</hi> and ratified by his Blood, were, the
Deliverance of mankind from the powers of darkneſs, and the inheritance
of the kingdom of Light.</p>
                  <p>4. The <hi>Parallel</hi> between the Inſtitution of the <hi>Paſſover</hi> and of the <hi>Lords
Supper;</hi> or of the two Inheritances bequeathed, the one by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the other
by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is ſo plain that it needs no Comment. It only requires a diligent
Reader or Hearer; or what is wanting on the ordinary Hearers part may
be ſupplied by every ordinary Catechiſt before the receiving of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramental
Pledges. One point yet remaines more pertinent to the unfold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of our Apoſtles meaning, [Heb. 9. ver. 15. <hi>And for this cauſe he is the
Mediator of the new Teſtament, that by meanes of death, for the redemption of
the tranſgreſſions that were under the Firſt Teſtament, they which are called might
receive the promiſe of Eternal Inheritance. For where a Teſtament is, there
muſt alſo of neceſſitie be the death of the Teſtator. For a Teſtament is of force after
men are dead: otherwiſe it is of no ſtrength at all while the Teſtator liveth.]</hi> And
it is this: As the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did not enter upon the inheritance, or take poſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſion
of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> till after <hi>Moſes</hi> the <hi>Teſtator</hi> or <hi>Mediator of the
old Teſtament,</hi> was dead; ſo neither was the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi> our ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
inheritance <hi>ſet open</hi> to all or any Beleivers until Chriſt Jeſus, the
<hi>Teſtator</hi> or <hi>Mediator</hi> of the <hi>new Teſtament,</hi> was crucified, dead, buried, and
rayſed again to immortal Glorie. Since which time, as is the King, ſo is the
Kingdom or inheritance bequeathed; ſo is the Teſtament it ſelf, being ſealed
by his bloody death; <hi>All and every of them, Truely Everlaſting.</hi>

                  <head type="sub">The Parallel between the moſt Solemn Services of the Law and
The One Sacrifice of Chriſt. And, The high praeeminence and

                  <p>1. THe principal Termes of proportion in this <hi>Parallel</hi> which ſerve
as ſo many ſeveral <hi>Kens</hi> or Markes for the right ſurvaying of it, are
The ſervices of the Law, or the Offices of Legal Prieſts, and the
Perpetual Function of our High Prieſt. The ſervices of the Law wherein our
Apoſtle inſtanceth, are the Principal and moſt Solemn Sacrifices, which were
injoyned to the Prieſts after the order of <hi>Aaron.</hi> The <hi>One Sort</hi> whereof were
<hi>Anniverſaries,</hi> as of Bullockes and Goates<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to be offered every year upon
<hi>the day of Attonement,</hi> and ſo to be offered from the Firſt Erection of the <hi>Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle</hi>
in the wilderneſs, ſo long as the Law of Ceremonies was <hi>de Jure</hi> to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue,
untill our Saviours death upon the Croſs; ſince which time all Bloody
Sacrifice have loſt their <hi>Legal Vſe.</hi> The <hi>Other</hi> ſervice was That Sacrifice of the
<hi>Red Heifer,</hi> and the Conſecration of water by the ſprinkling or mingling her
Aſhes; which perhaps was not Anniverſarie, nor often put in practice from
the time of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Death untill the Aſcenſion of our Saviour into heaven.</p>

                     <pb n="3262" facs="tcp:100044:149"/>
Now our Apoſtle takes it as granted, that if theſe <hi>choice Sacrifices,</hi> of <hi>Atton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi>
and of the <hi>Red Cow,</hi> were altogether unſufficient to purifie the Hearts
and Conſciences, or the Soules and Spirits of ſinful men; the Ordinary
or meaner ſacrifices of the Law were much more <hi>unſufficient</hi> to all ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
as the Sacrifices of our high Prieſt was <hi>Alſufficient</hi> to all ſuch pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
as the Sacrifice of our high Prieſt was <hi>Alſufficient</hi> and moſt Efficacious
for. The <hi>Eminency</hi> of Chriſts bloudie Sacrifice upon the Croſs (in reſpect of all
Legal ſacrifices of what rank ſoever) conſiſteth, <hi>Firſt,</hi> in the Efficacy which
it had and hath for Remiſſion of all ſins committed againſt the Moral Law
of God; that is, of all ſuch ſins as immediately pollute the reaſonable Soul
and Conſcience. The leaſt degree of ſuch Purification no Legal Sacrifices
could immediatly effect, reach, or touch. To what Uſe then did they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
ſerve? or what was the proper <hi>Effect</hi> unto which they were immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
terminated? That was the Purification of mens Bodyes from meere
Legal uncleanneſſe; that is, from all ſuch negligences, Ignorances, or Caſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Occurrences as not being expiated by the Prieſt, did exclude the parties
ſo offending from the Tabernacle of the Congregation; Or (as our Apoſtle
ſpeakes) to <hi>Purifie</hi> them from ſuch <hi>uncleanneſſes of the fleſh,</hi> as did but fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadow
or picture the <hi>uncleanneſs of the ſoul,</hi> or the dead works of ſinne, All
which, being not expiated by a more excellent Prieſt then any was after the
order of <hi>Aaron<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> will exclude all from entring into the heavenly Tabernacle.</p>
                  <p>2. Such Legal uncleanneſſe, as did exclude the Parties polluted with it
from the Tabernacle of the Congregation, was many waies contracted; as
by touching of the dead; by eating of Meats forbidden by the Law; or by
not eating meates allowed of by the Law according to the Rule or Preſcript
for ſuch Ceremonial Services; or by the like Omiſſions or Practiſes which
were not in their own nature or <hi>to all men</hi> ſinful, but ſinful in the <hi>Seed of Jacob</hi>
only, to whom they were <hi>Evill only becauſe forbidden,</hi> not <hi>forbidden becauſe they
were evill</hi> in their own nature. Even in regard of ſuch ſhadows or Typical Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
for Purifying men Legally unclean, the beſt and moſt ſolemn Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices
of the Law (though offered once at leaſt every year, and otherwiſe as
often as dayly Occaſions or Occurrences did require) were no way ſo efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
or Effectual, as the <hi>One Sacrifice</hi> of the Son of God offered by himſelf
but <hi>Once</hi> for all, is for the perpetual <hi>Purifying</hi> of our Soules from the <hi>Dead
works</hi> of ſin, and for our <hi>Conſecration</hi> to the everlaſting ſervice of the everli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving

                  <p>3. The Eminencie of Chriſts Prieſthood and Sacrifice, above the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood

to the Hebrews, more peremptorily contradicted by them, then it was by
the Incredulous or unbelieving Jews, in his life time. The <hi>Weſtern Anti-Chriſt</hi>

his holy Sacraments, may with its improvement be concludently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
by the <hi>Tenents</hi> and daily <hi>Practiſes</hi> of that <hi>Church, both</hi> which are as
punctually and as fully contradictory to the Doctrine of the Author of this
Epiſtle, Chap. 9. and 10. and to many other principal <hi>Maxims</hi> of Chriſtian
Religion, as any Doctrine, Tenent, or Practiſe can be one to another. <hi>For
the Law having a ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the
things, can never with thoſe Sacrifices which they offered year by year continually to
make the Comers thereunto perfect. For then would they not have ceaſed to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
becauſe that the worſhippers once purged ſhould have had no more conſcience
of Sins. But in thoſe ſacrifices there is a remembrance again made of ſinnes every
year. For it is not poſsible that the bloud of Bulls and Goates ſhould take away ſins,
&amp;c.</hi> Heb. 10. 1, 2, 3, 4. <hi>By the which we are ſanctified through the offering of the
body of Jeſus Chriſt ONCE FOR ALL. And every Prieſt ſtandeth daily mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring
and offering oftentimes the ſame ſacrifices which can never take away ſinnes.

for ſinnes for ever, <hi>ſat do<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

till his enemies be made his footſtool. For by one offering he hath perfected for
ever them that are ſanctified. Whereof the holy Ghoſt alſo is a witneſs to us: for
after that he had ſaid before, this is the Covenant that will make with them after
thoſe dayes, ſaith the Lord: I will put my Laws into their hearts, and in their minds
will I write them: and their ſinnes and iniquities will I remember no more. Now
where Remiſsion of theſe is, there is no more offering for Sin,</hi> ver. 10. to 18.</p>
                  <p>4. The force of our Apoſtles <hi>Inference,</hi> and the very Pith of his Diſcourſe
throughout theſe Paſſages, preſented to the Readers View, doth more pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually
refute the Doctrine of the <hi>Romiſh Maſſe,</hi> then it did the <hi>Contradicting,
Jews,</hi> or other Blaſphemers of Chriſts Name and Office, either before or
ſince this Divine Epiſtle was written. <hi>The Pith and Marrow of all his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
conſiſts in This;</hi> That even the beſt of Legal Sacrifices or ſervices (were
they bloudy or unbloudy) were altogether Unſufficient to Purifie the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience,
could never take away ſin; Becauſe <hi>They were to be Reiterated,</hi> the
beſt and moſt ſolemn of them every Year, and many of them every Day,
others as oft as Caſual Occaſions did require Now if this Argument be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludent
(as no Chriſtian can denie it to be) againſt the Jews which pleaded for
the <hi>Sufficiencie</hi> of Legal Sacrifices, it will conclude <hi>a fortiori,</hi> or with a <gap reason="foreign">

Heb 9. 14. againſt the abſolute Perfection or Sufficiencie of our Saviours
Sacrifice of Himſelf (ſuppoſing that it ſhould be as the Romaniſts teach.)
Thus much it will inevitably inferre, according to the Peremptory Canons of
the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, which plainly teach, and under pain of damnation injoyn
all Chriſtians to believe, that Chriſts Body and Bloud <hi>That very ſame Body,
that very ſame bloud</hi> which were <hi>once offered</hi> by himſelf upon the Croſſe, are
daily offered by the Maſle-Prieſt. Or, as if this were not enough, to out-vie
the Jewiſh Synagogue in the Sin of Contradiction to Chriſt, they adde, that
every ſuch offering <hi>is a propitiatorie Sacrifice</hi> as well for ſome that be dead, as
for the living. And I think ſuch Oblations as they make, do the one ſort
as little good or as little harm as they doe the other, unleſſe they ſollicite the
Prieſt to make this kind of Attonement for them. But to ſuch Sollicitors
or Executors of ſuch Sollicitations both Doctrine and Practiſe muſt needs
create as great danger as any Hereſie, or Branch of Contradicting Infidelitie
hath done or can do to the mainteiners of it. This Branch of the Roman
Churches Doctrine doth as punctually Contradict that Fundamental Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,

7. But wherein did the <hi>Roman Church</hi> ſo groſly miſtake the meaning of the
Holy Ghoſt in that inſtance of the <hi>Red Heifer,</hi> Heb. 9. ver. 13. Or, to what
miſchievous inconvenience doth her practiſe unto this day, upon this miſtake
amount? To no leſs inconvenience, to no lower degree of Antichriſtian
Impietie then this, that the Legal Prieſts with their Ceremonies or Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
ſhould be truer Types of every Maſſe-Prieſt, whether of higher or low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Rank, and of their ſervices, then of <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> our high Prieſt, or of his
everlaſting Sacrifice, and perpetual Function: Both which were and are
performed by him in his own Perſon, not by any Deputies or Vicars. But
to me it is no wonder, if that Church do make <hi>Aaron, Eleazar,</hi> and their Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors
rather Types of Maſſe-Prieſts then of Chriſt: ſeeing (as hath been
obſerved before) they make <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> himſelf (according to whoſe
<hi>Order</hi> the Son of God only was to be conſecrated <hi>high-Prieſt)</hi> a more lively
Type of meaneſt Maſſe-Prieſts, then any true adumbration or ſhadow of
<hi>Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and the Service of the Maſſe-Prieſts at the Altar to be the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment
of Melchizedecks Prieſthood.</p>
                  <p>8. Had then the Anniverſarie ſacrifices of Buls and Goats upon the Day of
Attonement no Reference or relation to the Sacrament, of Chriſts Bodie
and Bloud? Nor the water of ſprinkling mingled with the aſhes of the <hi>Red
Heifer,</hi> no ſemblance with the Sacramental water of Baptiſm? Yes doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe,
both theſe Ceremonies had ſpecial Reference unto, and exact ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance
with theſe two <hi>Bleſſed Sacraments:</hi> And yet were both of them ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
or Types only of Chriſts <hi>Bloudy ſacrifice upon the Croſſe,</hi> and of the
perpetual Exerciſe of his <hi>Everlaſting Prieſthood,</hi> ſince he aſcended into his hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly
Tabernacle. Chriſt Jeſus only and his everlaſting Prieſt-Hood is the
very <hi>Body or ſolid ſubſtance</hi> of all Legal Rites or ſervices: And of this Body
the Anniverſarie ſacrifices, whether of Attonement or others, were true
Types or ſhadows. And of the ſame Body or Subſtance, the Sacraments
of his body and bloud, and of Baptiſm are ſomewhat <hi>more then Types;</hi> True

                  <p>2. For ſuch <hi>private writers</hi> as have gone too far in the Poynts mentioned, in
what Chriſtian Church ſoever they be, I leave them to anſwer for themſelves
and for thoſe whoſe doctrin they Follow. My purpoſe is onely to requeſt
my Brethren of the <hi>Church of England</hi> (however for the preſent they ſtand
affected in theſe poynts) to take it into more deep and Logical Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
then hitherto it hath been taken by Engliſh Preachers or Writers;
<q>Whether, According to <hi>Forrain Rigid Tenets</hi> of Predeſtination, or of
Gods abſolute irreſpective Decree for Election and Reprobation, (which
came to us Engliſh at the third hand, as from <hi>Zwinglius</hi> &amp;c. which They had
at the firſt, from <hi>ſome antient Romiſh Schoolemen,)</hi> it be poſſible for us or
them to maintain by any rational way; That our Lord and Saviour Jeſus
Chriſt either now is, or hath been a true <hi>Prieſt or Sacrificer,</hi> rather then
<hi>a meer Sacrifice</hi> predeſtinated from eternitie for takeing away the ſinnes
of the Elect onely? Or whether ſuch, as They Term <hi>Elect from Eternitie,</hi>
needed any Prieſt at all beſides God the Father who did deſtinate his Onely
Son to be a Sacrifice or a mean neceſſary (though ſubordinate) for effecting
<pb n="3267" facs="tcp:100044:151"/>
the principal or utmoſt end of his Decree; to wit, his own Glory by the
ſalvation of the Elect?</q> My poor Capacitie for theſe 34. yeares wherein I
have lived a Miniſter, or Prieſt, of the Church of England, could never,
nor yet can find any tolerable anſwer, or Evaſion, to free, ſuch as main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
the often-mentioned <hi>Rigid Decree,</hi> from theſe <hi>Two Imputations. The
One,</hi> That they cannot truely or by any rational way acknowledge Chriſt
to be a <hi>Prieſt</hi> after the order of Melchiſedec: The <hi>Other,</hi> That they cannot
acknowledge him to be properly inſtyled ſuch a <hi>Judge,</hi> as in our Creed we
profeſs him to be. They will at length be enforced to borrow a more fit
expreſſion of his Office from our Siſter-Nation, and inſtyle him to be the
<hi>Doomeſter</hi> or <hi>Doomeſman</hi> of the Quick and of the Dead; that is, <hi>an Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior
Officer,</hi> which hath no hand or Vote in the courſe of Juſtice for Life
and Death, but onely a power or delegated authoritie to read or pronounce
the ſentence which the Judge or Cheif Officer of State had written before;
though not ſo long before or in ſuch indeleble Characters, as the <hi>Doom,</hi>
which our Saviour Chriſt ſhall pronounce upon Every man at the Great day
of his appearance, was written in the Life-books of life and death everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
My exhortation, unto every man amongſt us which beleive in his name,
ſhall be, that of the Learned and pious <hi>Hemingius:</hi> 
                     <q>That we ſeek not our
aſſurance of Faith or hope <hi>in Parcarum Tabulis,</hi> which were irreverſibly
written before any part of the world was made (if we may beleive ſome
heathen poets or Stoicks,) but in, Gods promiſes made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and to
be performed by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> as he is now our High-Prieſt and King, and
as the Supream Judge of Quick and Dead.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>3. Having thus farr endeavoured to <hi>ſever the droſs</hi> or wipe off the
Aſperſions (or ſuch meaner ſtuffe) as have been caſt upon, or mingled
themſelves with that <hi>Golden Foundation</hi> layd by our Apoſtle <hi>Hebr.</hi> 9. My
next Addreſſment muſt be to <hi>Dilate</hi> or <hi>Diduct</hi> the Precious Metal contained
in it, or in the <hi>Third Parallel</hi> propoſed. The <hi>Parallel</hi> was between the
anniverſarie <hi>Sacrifices of Attonement,</hi> the Sacrifices of the <hi>Red Cow;</hi> and the
<hi>One Sacrifice</hi> offered <hi>Once for all</hi> by our <hi>Everlaſting High-Prieſt.</hi> His Sacrifice
is truely inſtyled <hi>Everlaſting,</hi> not for this reaſon alone, that it was of <hi>Infinite
Value,</hi> or a full price for purchaſing the <hi>Everlaſting Redemption</hi> of man-kind;
but in this reſpect alſo, that it hath an <hi>Everlaſting Efficacie</hi> for the dayly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of actual ſinnes, for purifying the Hearts and Conſciences of all ſuch
as in Faith dayly pray unto the Father in the name and mediation of his
only Son, who is likewiſe rightly inſtyled an <hi>Everlaſting Prieſt,</hi> not in regard
onely that he is now altogether <hi>immortal;</hi> but more eſpecially<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in that he
<hi>Perpetually</hi> executeth the Office of the High Prieſthood, by making <hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual
Interceſſion</hi> for us, &amp; by accompliſhing our Reconciliation unto the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head.
<hi>All things are of God who hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt,
and hath given to us the Miniſterie of reconciliation: to wit, that God was in
Chriſt reconciling the world unto himſelf, not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them,
and hath commited unto Vs the word of reconciliation.</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 18, 19.
<hi>This</hi> Reconciliation <hi>Quâ Deus nos ſibi reconciliavit,</hi> was wrought by <hi>Chriſt</hi>
whileſt he went about on earth doing good, and by his ſufferings upon the
Croſs &amp;c. <hi>The Other</hi> part of our Reconciliation, or reconciliation taken
in the <hi>Paſſive Senſe, Quâ nos Deo reconciliamur,</hi> is dayly wrought in true
Beleivers by this our <hi>High-Prieſt;</hi> and ſo wrought, by the continuated par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
of his Spirit, by the interpoſed renovations or nouriſhments of
that Grace, which immediatly deſcendes to us from the ſweet influence of
this Sun of righteouſneſs, now ſitting more Glorious (by much) in his
<pb n="3268" facs="tcp:100044:152"/>
heavenly Tabernacle then the viſible Sun in its Sphere. And of <hi>This Part</hi> of
Reconciliation, or of Reconciliation in the <hi>Paſsive Senſe,</hi> muſt that of our
<hi>Apoſtle</hi> be underſtood.</p>
                  <p>Now then we are Embaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we
pray you in Chriſts ſtead to be reconciled to God. For he hath made him, to be ſin for
us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the Righteouſneſs of God in him,
2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>4. He that deſires to gueſſe aright at the Eminencie of <hi>Chriſts Prieſt-hood</hi>
and Sacrifice, in reſpect of the <hi>Aaronical</hi> or <hi>Legal</hi> Services, or to take ſuch an
indefinite Eſtimate of both, as may <hi>advance</hi> his Meditations upon <hi>The know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of Chriſt crucified, and aſcended into the heaven of heavens,</hi> may follow the
Scale ſet by <hi>Aſtronomers</hi> betwixt the ſpace of Local diſtances on earth, and
the ſpace of the higheſt Coeleſtial Orbes or Spheres, which anſwer in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to them; alwaies allowing a greater <hi>Exceſſe of Proportion</hi> between the
Excellencie of <hi>Chriſts Prieſthood,</hi> beyond <hi>Aarons or Melchiſedecks,</hi> then Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers
allot betwixt the ſpace of ſo many <hi>Degrees</hi> in the heavens and ſo many
<hi>miles</hi> on earth.</p>
                  <p>5. The <hi>Legal Prieſts</hi> or ſacrificers were, at the ſame time and by ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<hi>Many,</hi> their Sacrifices or <hi>Services</hi> were, both for their kinds or matter,
and for the ſolemn manner of their offerings, <hi>More.</hi> The ſeveral kinds of
their ſacrifices and Solemnities, I leave unto the Readers ſearch, this being
an Argument whereof many have written copiouſly enough in moſt modern
Churches. It will be enough for me to obſerve or call thus much to the
Readers Remembrance, that all the Offices or Services of Legal Prieſts were
fully accompliſhed in the <hi>Conſecration of the Son of God</hi> to be our <hi>Everlaſting
High Prieſt;</hi> That all their Offerings and Sacrifices (whether bloudy or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bloudy,
whether of Vegetables as of herbs, or green Eares of Corn, of
meal, of Loaves; whether anniverſary, or upon ſpecial occaſions) were
more then accompliſhed in his Own Once offering of himſelf. The <hi>All-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencie</hi>
of this his Oblation of himſelf will beſt appear from the due Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
of the <hi>Multiplicitie</hi> of the former ſacrifices, and the often Reiteration
of them. Of bloudie ſacrifices ſome were reiterated <hi>Every day,</hi> others <hi>Every
year,</hi> or in <hi>Sett Feſtivals,</hi> or upon <hi>Special Occaſions</hi> for private Perſons: And this
laſt ſort of ſacrifices or Offerings were to be reiterated ſo often as Occaſions
or occurrences did interpoſe. No one ſacrifice could purifie the ſame par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
though peccant only againſt the Law of Ceremonies, from his Legal Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſſe
for any more Turns then One. Every <hi>Recidivation</hi> or Relapſe
into the ſame ſin or error was to have a <hi>new Purification.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>6. Now if it were poſſible to calculate, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The multitude of ſinnes, and
of ſinners againſt the Moral Law of God, in compariſon of ſuch as did ſinne
againſt the Law of Ceremonies; <hi>Secondly,</hi> The exceſſive number of ſinnes
committed by every particular Chriſtian man; <hi>and bear this truth in mind,</hi>
that there needs no other ſacrifice either for ſinne or ſinners beſides <hi>That One
of Chriſt himſelf upon the Croſs,</hi> the Influence of whoſe infinite value is daily
and hourly communicated to all ſuch as ſeek ſalvation by him: The <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excellencie</hi>
of this our <hi>high Prieſt,</hi> and of his ſacrifice, in reſpect of all Legal
Prieſts and ſervices, will farre ſurmount the compaſſe of the Higheſt Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
or Orbes imaginable, in compariſon of the leaſt ſenſible part of the
Earth.</p>
                  <p>7. But ſome <hi>New-ſtarted Opinions</hi> there be, which take away much matter
of <hi>Admiration</hi> in this <hi>great Subject</hi> of Divine Meditation, and dull the ſpirits of
otherwiſe wel-minded men in the ſearch after the virtue of Chriſts <hi>Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3269" facs="tcp:100044:152"/>
Sacrifice and Prieſt-hood.</hi> Of theſe <hi>new Opinions,</hi> One ſpecial One is (for
I muſt not here touch upon the reſt) [That the ſinnes of ſome men, of all
the Elect, were remitted before they could be comitted:] An Opinion
voyd of all Reference to any pious uſe or practiſe; <hi>A Speculation
moſt untrue, prodigiouſly abſurd.</hi> For no actual ſin by whomſoever commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
can be remitted to men living here on earth, otherwiſe then by ſome
<hi>new Influence</hi> from the Everlaſting Sacrifice of Chriſt, or (as our <hi>Apoſtle</hi>
ſpeakes) without the <hi>ſprinkling of that bloud, Which ſpeaketh better things
then that of Abel.</hi> Heb. 12. 24. As much as I here intimate, that paſſage of
St. <hi>John</hi> (if it be rightly ſcanned) will clearely evince. <hi>If we ſay that we
have fellowſhip with him, and walk in darkneſs, we ly, and do not the truth; But
if we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his ſon, cleanſeth us from all ſin. If
we ſay that we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves and the truth is not in us. 1 Iohn.</hi>
1. 6, 7, 8.</p>
                  <p>8. So then, even ſuch as walk in the light, ſtand in need of <hi>Cleanſing</hi> by
the <hi>blood of Chriſt.</hi> And with Reference to this place (as I conceive) that
Maxim of S <hi>Auſtin,</hi> well approved of by the beſt Reformed writers, was
firſt conceived by him <hi>[Our Juſtification conſiſts in the perpetual Remiſſion of
ſin.]</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Juſtification Conſiſts not in one indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Act.</note> But an errour there is, which I know not when it did firſt creep into
the world, but creep it did by the Incogitancie, or indiſtinct Notions of ſome
Late writers <hi>[That Iustification is but one Act, never to be reſumed or reiterated.]</hi>
This <hi>Aſſertion</hi> may be true in reſpect of <hi>That Justification, Quâ Deus nos
juſtificat,</hi> or of Juſtification taken in the <hi>Active Senſe</hi> as it concerns God;
For, <hi>no act of his can be reſumed or reiterated, nor admitt any interpoſitions or
Interims of time.</hi> But if we ſpeak of <hi>Juſtification in the Paſſive Senſe,</hi> or as
it is an Effect wrought in our ſoules by the ſpirit of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> there may be
and are many Acts, many <hi>Reſumptions</hi> or Renovations of the ſame Act or
Effect; All being wrought in us by <hi>Interpoſitions</hi> or ſeveral <hi>Interims</hi> of time.
Our Natural bodyes do not require ſo many <hi>Refections</hi> of meat and drink for
continuation of life, of health, and ſtrength, as the <hi>Faith by which the juſt
do live,</hi> and other ſpiritual Graces which accompanie Faith in the Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of our ſoules, do admitt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yea require <hi>Refections</hi> ſpiritual. Of theſe
refections or refreſhments of Faith or other Graces, ſome are obtained by
our dayly <hi>Prayers:</hi> others, being like extraordinary feaſts or banquets,
are wrought <hi>in the participation Chriſts Body and Blood,</hi> ſo often as we receive
that bleſſed Sacrament as we ought to do. But the moſt of us which enjoy
the Libertie of Chriſtian Lawes do not receives it <hi>ſo often</hi> as we ought;
Fewer <hi>as they</hi> ought. And whoſoever receives it unworthily receives it
too often, if he ſo receive but once. Unto the worthy Receivers of the
Sacramental pledges of Chriſts Body and Blood, how often ſo ever and how
many ſo ever receive them, the Blood of Chriſt, though but once ſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a Perennal unexhauſtible <hi>Fountain of life everlaſting.</hi> But of the right
interpretation of our Saviours Teſtament or Inſtitution of this bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,

                  <head type="sub">The Rarity of that Rite of conſecrating the Water of Sprinkling by
the Aſhes of the Red Heifer, an Emblem of Baptiſm and the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity
thereof. Our Churches meaning in ſome expreſſions at
the Adminiſtration of that Sacrament.</head>
                  <p>1. BUt although the frequent Uſe of the Sacrament of Chriſts Body
and Bloud be needful or neceſſary by Precept, and a Means much
available for ſtrengthening of Faith, or for repairing thoſe decayes
or ruines which the ſubtiltie of Satan works in our ſoules; yet the <hi>Reiteration</hi>
of the Sacrament of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is neither Neceſſary nor allowable, much leſſe
Commendable for ſuch purpoſes. And the <hi>Raritie,</hi> or rather <hi>Singularitie</hi> of
<hi>It,</hi> was to my apprehenſion, <hi>Emblematically prefigured by the Sacrifice of the Red
Heifer,</hi> or the <hi>Water of ſprinkling,</hi> which was Legally ſanctified or conſecrated
by her Aſhes. The Law concerning this kind of Purification is not to be
found (I take it) in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> at leaſt not in that ſixteenth Chapter wherein
the Law of the Sacrifice of attonement is punctually ſet down; However the
forementioned <hi>Gloſſarie</hi> upon the Romiſh Canon for conſecrating <hi>Holy Water,</hi>
either through negligence,<note place="margin">See Chapt. 48 Num. 6.</note> or ignorance, or both, avouch that place for it.
If the ſacrifice of the <hi>Red Heifer</hi> had belonged unto the Feaſt of attonement,
it muſt have been reiterated once every year, whereas the <hi>Hebrew Antiquaries</hi>
affirm; that this ſolemnitie was not uſed <hi>above tea times</hi> during all the time
of the Law, of the Tabernacle or Temple<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And whether it were <hi>ſo often</hi>
uſed may be queſtioned, becauſe there is no Law or Precept for the <hi>Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
of it, but only for the uſe of the water of ſprinkling (being once conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated
by it) ſo often as the occaſion ſpecified in the Law did require.</p>
                  <p>2. But unleſſe the frequent uſe of the water, ſo mingled with the aſhes,
did waſt or exhauſt the aſhes of that one ſacrifice, which <hi>Eleazar</hi> not <hi>Aaron</hi> was
commanded to offer, Theſe might have been preſerved without putrifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
for a longer time then the Law of Ceremonies was to endure. For <hi>Aſhes</hi>
(as good Naturaliſts tell us) being well kept are immortal, or <hi>an Emblem</hi>
of Immortalitie. But it may be that as ſoon, or as often, as the Aſhes of any
<pb n="3271" facs="tcp:100044:153"/>
ſuch ſacrifice were, by frequent uſe of the water of ſprinkling, exhauſted or
waſted, the Legal Prieſts were bound by the Law mentioned to offer ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for conſecrating the water of ſprinkling, whoſe uſe was to continue as
long as the reaſon mentioned in the Law did indure.</p>
                  <p>3. The chief uſe or End of the water of ſprinkling mingled with the Aſhes
of this ſacrifice, was to purifie ſuch as had made themſelves Legally unclean,
or had caſually fallen into ſuch uncleanneſs. One branch of this <hi>uncleanneſs</hi>
was the touching, or being touched by any <hi>Dead Corps.</hi> And unto this uſe
of the water of ſprinkling mentioned, Numb. 19. 11. that of our Apoſtle,
Heb. 9. 14. hath ſpecial <hi>Reference,</hi> more then <hi>Alluſion. How much more ſhall
the bloud of Chriſt purge our Conſciences from DEAD works?</hi> That this Legal
Sacrifice for ſinne was an Exquiſite Type of Chriſts Bloudy Death and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings,
or an exact picture of his bloud, wherewith the heavenly Sanctuary
or Holy places were purified, (although the bloud of this Legal ſacrifice
were not brought into the Earthly Sanctuary) no good Writers which I have
read either deny or queſtion. That the <hi>Water of ſprinkling</hi> conſecrated by
the aſperſion of the Aſhes of this Legal Sacrifice, did truely reſemble the
water of Baptiſm, by which we are waſhed from ſin, and conſecrated unto
God as clean perſons, that is, made members of his Church here on earth, is
ſo evident in it ſelf, that it needs no <hi>Paraphraſe</hi> or Laborious Comment upon
the fore-cited Law. Yet to this purpoſe the learned Reader may find much
pertinent matter, in <hi>Chytraeus his Comments upon the Book of Numbers,</hi> and in
many others. It will be more needful or better ſuiting with my intentions
in this place, to prevent the captious exceptions which ſome Anti-Papiſts
have heretofore taken and now reſume againſt the expreſſions of our <hi>Publick
Liturgie</hi> in that Part of it which concerns the Adminiſtration of Baptiſm.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Almighty and everlaſting God, which of thy great mercie diddeſt ſave
Noah and his Familie in the Ark from periſhing by water, and alſo diddeſt
ſafely lead the children of Iſrael through the red ſea, figuring thereby thy
holy Baptiſm; and by the Baptiſm of thy wel-beloved Son Ieſus Chriſt, did<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt
ſanctifie the floud Iordan and all other waters to the myſtical waſhing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way
of ſin. We beſeech thee for thine infinite mercies that thou wilt mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifully
look upon theſe Children, Sanctifie them and waſh them with the holy
Ghoſt; that they being delivered from thy wrath, may be received into the
Ark of Chriſts Church, and being ſtedfaſt in faith, joyful through hope, and
rooted in charity, may ſo paſſe the waves of this troubleſome world, that fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally
they may come to the land of everlaſting life, there to reign with thee
world Without end, through Ieſus Chriſt our Lord, Amen.</p>
                     <p>Seeing now, dearly beloved Brethren, that theſe Children be regenerate
and grafted into the body of Christs Congregation, let us give thanks unto
God for theſe Benefits, and with one accord make our prayers unto Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie
God, that they may lead the reſt of their life according to this begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                     <p>We yeild thee heartie thanks, moſt merciful Father, that it hath pleaſed
thee to regenerate this Infant with thy holy Spirit, to receive him for thine
own Child by adoption, and to incorporate him into thy holy Congregation,
and humbly we beſeech thee to grant, that he being dead unto ſin and living
unto righteouſneſs, and being buried with Chriſt in his death, may crucifie
the old man and utterly aboliſh the whole body of ſin, that as he is made
partaker of the death of thy Son, ſo he may be partaker of his reſurrection, ſo
that finally with the reſidue of thy holy congregation, he may be Inheritor of
thine everlaſting Kingdom, through Chriſt our Lord. Amen.</p>

4. It is no part of our Churches Doctrin or meaning, that the <hi>waſhing or
ſprinkling</hi> infants bodyes with Conſecrated water ſhould take away ſinnes
by it's <hi>own immediate</hi> Vertue. To affirm thus much implies as I conceive a
Contradiction to that Apoſtolical doctrin. <hi>The like figure whereunto even
Baptiſm doth alſo now ſave us, (not the putting away the filth of the fleſh, but
the anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God) by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt,
who is gone into heaven &amp;c.</hi> 1. Pet. 3. 21. The meaning of our Church
intends no further then thus; That if this Sacrament of Baptiſm be duely
adminiſtred, the blood, or bloody Sacrifice of Chriſt; or (which is all one)
the Influence of his ſpirit doth alwaies accompany, or is <hi>Concurrent</hi> to this
ſolemn Act. But whether this Influence of his ſpirit or Vertual preſence
of his body and blood be either immediatly or only terminated to the ſoul
and ſpirit of the party Baptized, or have ſome vertual influence upon the
water of Baptiſm as a mean to convey the Grace of Regeneration unto the
ſoule of the partie Baptized, whileſt the water is poured upon him, is
<hi>Too Nice</hi> and curious a Queſtion in this Age for ſober Chriſtians to debate or
contend about. It may ſuffice to beleive that this <hi>Sacramental pledge</hi> hath
a <hi>Vertual Preſence</hi> of Chriſts Blood or ſome Real Influence from his Body
Concomitant though not Conſubſtantiated to it, which is prefigured, or
ſignified by the waſhing or ſprinkling the body with water.</p>
                  <p>5. But it will be, or rather is <hi>Objected,</hi> but only by privat or ſome ſawcy
ſpirits; That if the Doctrin of our Church were true and ſound, then all
that be rightly Baptized ſhould be undoubtedly ſaved, being once waſhed
or cleanſed from their ſinnes. <hi>The Objection</hi> were of ſome force, if the
Church of England did hold or maintain ſuch Doctrin or <hi>Tenets,</hi> as they do
which make or favour it, to wit, <hi>That the ſins of the Elect only are remitted
by Baptiſm, or, by the Sacrament of Chriſts Body and Blood:</hi> or, <hi>That ſins once
remitted cannot be remitted afreſh;</hi> or that <hi>the Partie which is once pardoned
for his ſins, before commited, cannot afterwards be condemned.</hi> The Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxal
Truth is, That albeit the Original Sin of Children truly Baptized
in the name of Chriſt, or the Actual ſins of young or elder men ſo Baptized,
and the ſins of their forefathers (ſo far as it concernes men of riper yeares
to repent them of both) be ſo truly remitted in Baptiſm, that neither young
men nor old may be Baptized again; Yet the <hi>Aſtipulation of a good Conſcience,</hi>
wherein the internal Baptiſm (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells) doth conſiſt, may and ought
by the Law of God and of Chriſts Church, to be reiterated.</p>
                  <p>And this <hi>Aſtipulation</hi> of every Chriſtian, male or femal, though
baptized after they have paſſed their Nonage for Civil contracts,<note place="margin">Though Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme may not be reiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, yet The Aſtipulation of a good Conſcience (or the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireing to God) may dayly, and muſt often be renewed.</note> ought to
be reſumed or re-acknowledged ſo often as they intend to receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
pledges of Chriſts body and blood, either privately or in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
congregation. But for all ſuch as have been baptized in their Infancie,
the Perſonal Reſumption or Ratification of that VOW, which their Fathers
and Mothers in God, did make for them at the <hi>Sacred Laver,</hi> is to be exacted
of them <hi>Ore tenus,</hi> in ſome publick Congregation, before they can be
lawfully admitted to be Publick Communicants of Chriſts Body and
Blood.</p>
                  <p>6. There is then no default or defect in the Church of England Doctrin
or Lawes concerning Baptiſm,<note place="margin">No child or Infant Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed may or ought to be admitted unto the Sacrament of Chriſts Body and Blood before he have in his own perſon ratified that VOW, which his Sureties or ſpiritual Guardians did make for him at the <hi>Sacred Font,</hi> where Chrîſt is as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

men unto whom the Execution of theſe Lawes is eſpecially commended,
whether they be of Lower, of higher, or of the higheſt Rank. It hath not
been my hap to peruſe very many Preſentments of Church-Wardens or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour
Prieſts in <hi>Viſitations;</hi> Yet of thoſe few or any, whereof I have had
ſome Cognizance, I have obſerved but a <hi>very few,</hi> or ſcarce remember any
tendred againſt the <hi>Parents,</hi> or ſuch as were <hi>Sureties</hi> for Infants at the <hi>ſacred

                  </p>

every day bleſſe my Lord God, as for all others, ſo in particular for this
Great Bleſſing beſtowed upon me, that I was in a Convenient Age, in a
happy time and place, preſented by my Sureties in Baptiſm, to ratifie the
<hi>VOW</hi> which they made for me, and to receive the <hi>Benediction</hi> of the <hi>Biſhop

Doctrine</hi> did begin and propagate it ſelf in <hi>Germanie,</hi> before <hi>Melancthon</hi> did

But the infection in the mean time did ſo farr overſpread the Church of

that not three hundred <hi>Bellarmines,</hi> not ſo many <hi>Valentia's,</hi> or other

ſo many from Reformed Religion, as <hi>Dr. Heſſils</hi> did with-hold from embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing

ſuch Sawcy Malepert <hi>Vocaliſts,</hi> as have the gift to let the Word of God runne
as faſt out at their mouthes, as it comes into their braines either by the Ear
or Eye. But if it enter once into the thoughts of a Sober Conſcientious Spirit,

                  <p>4. For Concluſion of this <hi>Tragical Conſideration,</hi> I would requeſt all ſuch
as ſit in judicature, ſpecially in Cauſes Criminal, to call to mind, or ſuffer
Me to be their Remembrancer, of a <hi>Grave ſaying</hi> delivered by a great <hi>Praelate</hi>
in the high Court of Parliament, <hi>That Severitie without inſtruction is a kind of
Tyranny.</hi> More particularly my humble requeſt is, that with good leave I
may put ſuch in mind as judge ſeditious, turbulent, or enormous practiſes
(or Cenſure <hi>Fellones de ſe)</hi> that they ſhall mightily condemn themſelves by
judging them, unleſs they be as forward withall to quell the <hi>Erroneous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi>
(whether by Lawes Eccleſiaſtical or Civil) whence the former Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes
ſpring, <hi>As</hi> that kind of Sedition, Stubborn diſobedience, diſloyalty,
<hi>Scandalum Magnatum,</hi> or privie Conſpiracie, under whoſe heavie burden
this State and Church doth now ſigh and groan. Theſe and divers other
like Branches of the Divels ſervice, are as true and proper <hi>Effects,</hi> or natural
iſſues, of the forementioned prepoſterous <hi>Belief,</hi> or Doctrine of <hi>Special faith</hi>
or <hi>Diviſion of</hi> all Mankind into <hi>Two Sorts;</hi> as Chriſtian Charitie, Humilitie,
Obedience, Penitencie or Contrition of Spirit, are of the true and wel-grounded
<hi>Belief</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt and of him Crucified.</p>
                  <p>5. The beſt inſtructions that can be given for rectifying the former Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,
is that of our Apoſtle, Rom. 4. <hi>(Though we follow the Interpretations
or Hints of thoſe Writers whom theſe</hi> Zelots <hi>moſt admire.) He ſtaggered not at</hi>
                     <pb n="3276" facs="tcp:100044:156"/>
the promiſe of God through unbelief: but was ſtrong in Faith, giving glory to
God, and being fully perſwaded, that what he had promiſed he was able alſo to
performe. And therefore it was imputed to him for Righteouſneſs. Now it was
not written for his ſake alone; that it was imputed to him; But for us alſo to whom
it ſhall be imputed, if we believe on him that raiſed up Jeſus our Lord from the
dead, who was delivered for our offences, and was raiſed againe for our Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Two Branches of Juſtification: The One from Chriſts

                  <p>1. TO proceed thus farr in the <hi>Knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>Him
Crucified,</hi> and in the practice of Chriſtian Duties Concomitant
to ſuch <hi>Knowledge,</hi> is more, I am afraid, (or rather fully perſwaded,)
then moſt of ſuch as take upon them to ſeal Aſſurance to themſelves and
to others, of their ſalvation, (by Markes and Tokens of the <hi>Elect,</hi> of their
own coyning) have rightly got by Heart. And yet to reſt ſecure, upon
theſe Grounds, though learned by heart, of their <hi>perſonal Salvation</hi> or irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſible
Eſtate in Grace or in Gods Favour, doth open a gap unto <hi>helliſh Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocriſie,</hi>
which our Saviour himſelf hath commanded us to beware of, or
rather to ſhut it out, as it is in that parable, <hi>Mat. 12. 43, 44, 45. When
the unclean ſpirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places ſeeking reſt,
and findeth none; Then he ſaith I will return into my houſe from whence I came
Out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty ſwept and garniſhed: Then goeth
he, and taketh with himſelf ſeven other ſpirits more wicked then himſelf, and
they enter in and dwell there, and the laſt ſtate of that man is worſe then the firſt:
Even ſo ſhall it be alſo to this wicked generation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For the right application of this Parable to the Jews, with whom our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
there diſputes, as alſo unto men of this and former Ages, I referr the

                  <p>2. Thus much is ſufficient to our preſent purpoſe, and thus much is moſt

cleare; That it is not the <hi>Sweeping or garniſhing of the heart,</hi> or emptineſs of
ſuch vices, as do raign in the hearts of Infidels, and give Satan poſſeſſion of
them, (all which may be wrought by the ſerious conſideration of Chriſts death
Paſſion, and by the imputation of his Merits) that can ſecure us from further
aſſaults of Satan to our final deſtruction. Rather, for us to preſume upon
theſe without <hi>Experiments,</hi> without a continual Guard upon our own ſoules,
is but as if a man having beaten his adverſaries out of his houſe ſhould ſet up
his ſtaffe, or ſword, or other inſtrument of warre without the door to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
his enemie by this opportunitie to make forcible entrance when he is
leaſt aware. To what End then doth the <hi>Contemplation</hi> of Chriſts death or
the <hi>Imputation</hi> of his merits ſerve us? Do theſe beget no portion or degree
of any Certaintie of our Eſtate in Chriſt, or of Salvation? Yes, they alwaies
bring forth a <hi>Certainty</hi> though not of <hi>Faith,</hi> yet of <hi>Hope,</hi> that God in his Good
time will accompliſh theſe good beginnings, and crown them with more
then a <hi>Moral,</hi> with an <hi>Experimental certainty</hi> or aſſurance of our Eſtate in
Grace. For Regulating our perſwaſions in this point, there can be no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<hi>Rule</hi> then that of our Apoſtle, Rom. 5. <hi>Therefore being juſtified by faith,
we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom alſo we have acceſs
by Faith into his Grace wherein we ſtand, and rejoyce in hope of the Glorie of God,</hi>
ver. 1, 2. And again more fully, ver. 8, 9, 10, 11. <hi>God commendeth his love
towards us, in that whileſt we were yet ſinners Chriſt dyed for us. Much more then,
being now juſtified by his bloud we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him. For if
when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more
being reconciled, we ſhall be ſaved by his life. And not only ſo, but we alſo joy in
God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom we have now received the attonement.</hi>
The Ground then of our <hi>Hope,</hi> or of ſuch <hi>Certaintie</hi> as we can attain unto in
this life, is our <hi>Reconciliation</hi> to God, of which our Apoſtle ſpeakes more fully
and divinely, 2 Cor. 5. <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new Creature; Old
things are paſt away; behold, all things are become new: and all things are of God,
who hath reconciled us to himſelf by Jeſus Chriſt, and hath given to us the miniſterie
of Reconciliation, to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himſelf
not imputing their treſpaſſes unto them, and hath committed to us the word of recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation,
ver.</hi> 17, 18, 19. But if this <hi>Reconciliation</hi> were ſufficient for our
<hi>Certaintie</hi> of Salvation, what need were there of a <hi>ſecond Reconciliation,</hi> or a
ſecond part (at leaſt) of the ſame <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> which our Apoſtle preſſeth
upon us, ver. 20. 21. <hi>Now then we are Ambaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God
did beſeech you by us; we pray you in Chriſts ſtead to be reconciled to God: For he
hath made him to be ſin for us, who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of God in Him. The firſt part of Reconciliation is Active,</hi> or at the moſt
part, but a <hi>Grammatical Paſsive.</hi> As a man is ſaid to be <hi>Called</hi> when he is ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
to appear, though he make no Perſonal Appearance: ſo are we ſaid
to be <hi>Reconciled</hi> to God, when pardon for our ſins is proclaimed, though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we could take notice of it. The <hi>Second Reconciliation</hi> is <hi>a Real paſsive,</hi> and
includes a <hi>Turning unto the Lord by Acceptance of our Pardon,</hi> and by ſerious
purſuing the Allowance of it. The <hi>former part of Recenciliation</hi> is wrought
by meer <hi>Imputation</hi> of Chriſts death and merits; The <hi>ſecond</hi> is wrought part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
by <hi>Imputation,</hi> but eſpecially by <hi>Real Participation</hi> of Grace from Chriſt,
and gifts of the ſpirit. <hi>Theſe are They</hi> that muſt defend and guard our ſoules,
againſt the Re-entry or Re-poſſeſſion of Satan and wicked ſpirits, whether
by fair or forcible means.</p>
                  <p>3. Anſwerable to the <hi>Two Sorts</hi> or Degrees of <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> there are <hi>Two
Sorts</hi> or two Branches of <hi>Iuſtification:</hi> The <hi>One</hi> by meere <hi>Imputation</hi> of Chriſts
<pb n="3279" facs="tcp:100044:157"/>
Death and Paſſion, which was once wrought for all, at his Conſecration to
His <hi>Everlaſting Prieſt-hood: The Other,</hi> by <hi>Participation</hi> of his Grace, or Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of his <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> ſince his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion. During the time
of Legal Sacrifices, whether for ſinnes againſt the Ceremonial or Moral Law,
the People were bound upon new occaſions, to bring new Sacrifices unto the
Prieſt, and he bound to offer them up unto the Lord for their Reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Attonement. For us Chriſtians to think or conceive of more Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
for ſinne then <hi>One,</hi> that was <hi>Once</hi> offered for all, were to deny Chriſt, or
the Efficacie of His <hi>Everlaſting Prieſthood.</hi> But as for the Sacrifices of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
prayſes or thankſgiving for what is paſt, or ſupplications for the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of Chriſts Spirit for the time to come, Theſe we are bound to offer up
to God by Chriſt more frequently then the Jews could offer up their blou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Sacrifices, or then the Prieſts could attend this ſervice, which they were
to attend only at certain houres or Solemn Times, becauſe they were
but mortal men and could not perform their Office, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. But
Chriſt ſince his Reſurrection and Aſcenſion, is not only <hi>an Everlaſting High
Prieſt,</hi> but doth exerciſe this his Function without Intermiſſion. <hi>Every
Prieſt ſtandeth dayly miniſtring, and offering oftentimes the ſame ſacrifices which
can never take away ſins. But this</hi> (Prieſt) <hi>after he had offered one Sacrifice for
ſin ſate down on the right hand of God For ever.</hi> So the <hi>Syriack</hi> reades &amp; <hi>Points</hi> it,
much better then the <hi>Ordinary Engliſh</hi> doth, or the <hi>Greek,</hi> as may appear from
a Parallel place, Hebr. 7. 3. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>He remaineth a Prieſt for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Briefly, though every ſin, perhaps every Groſs ſin which we commit,
after our Juſtification by the Reſurrection of Chriſt, and reall Participation
of his Grace, doth not work a <hi>Total Interruption</hi> in our Eſtate, or Intereſt in
him: yet every ſuch ſin doth work a decay or diminution of Grace, or ſome
extinguiſhment of the Spirit of Life: both which muſt be repayred by the
Efficacy or Exerciſe of his <hi>Everlaſting Prieſt-hood.</hi> None is <hi>ſo juſt</hi> whether
by <hi>Imputation</hi> of his merits, or by <hi>Encreaſe</hi> of Grace, but may and muſt be
dayly <hi>more juſtifyed;</hi> So that the Son of God doth ſet <hi>us free, Firſt,</hi> by his ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
upon the Croſs; <hi>Secondly,</hi> by the Laver of Baptiſm and by Partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation
of his Life and Spirit; and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> he will ſet us <hi>Free indeed</hi> at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
of the Juſt, when we ſhall be tranſlated into that heavenly houſe
or manſion wherein he abideth for ever.</p>
                  <p>5. Thus much of the <hi>Knowledge of Chriſt,</hi> and of him <hi>Crucified,</hi> and of the
exerciſe of his <hi>Everlaſting Prieſt-hood;</hi> Points, wherein I could wiſh to take
more pains, though to the waſting of my bodily Spirits, upon Condition I
could perſwade a great part of the <hi>Clergie</hi> of this Kingdom, not to make
Chriſt Crucified and raiſed from the Dead, a <hi>meer By-ſtander</hi> in moſt of their
Diſputes concerning <hi>Election, &amp;c.</hi> as if he had ſhed his precious bloud to no

Excommunication or Damnation of others. Now whether I have juſtly

Dominion or Final Judicature, I here <hi>ſolemnly appeal</hi> unto Him in that great

and the Dead; To reward every man according to all his workes, whether

by the Church in Ages following for an <hi>Heretick?</hi> If his <hi>Opinion</hi> were
an <hi>Hereſie,</hi> why was not the <hi>Practiſe</hi> of the <hi>Antient Church Heretical?</hi> Some
Grave and Learned late Writers, would have the <hi>Novatas Hereſie,</hi> not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
to conſiſt in that he denyed <hi>Abſolution,</hi> or <hi>Communion with the Church</hi>
                     <pb n="3281" facs="tcp:100044:158"/>
unto <hi>Revolters,</hi> but in that he maintained, That the <hi>Church</hi> had no right or
Power to grant <hi>Abſolution</hi> unto ſuch Backſliders as <hi>Cornelius</hi> then <hi>Biſhop of
Rome</hi> (with the Advice and conſent of his <hi>Clergie)</hi> did grant unto; <hi>but</hi> that
this was a <hi>Caſe reſerved</hi> to God himſelf.</p>
                  <p>That ſuch Backſliders or Revolters might at the point of death be <hi>Abſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
Novatian</hi> himſelf had once ſolemnly profeſt. But after <hi>Cornelius,</hi> his
Competitioner for the <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> (being preferred to that Dignitie)
had authorized this Practiſe, he begun to ſet abroach his Error (whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that were) and to accuſe <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and his adherents, as Authors of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie</hi>
and Novelties in the Church. Had this <hi>Novatian</hi> been conſtant to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Tenets,</hi> and Profeſſion, made, before <hi>Cornelius</hi> was choſen <hi>Biſhop of
Rome,</hi> againſt him; he could not have denyed either of theſe <hi>Two Points of
Truth:</hi> Either that God had mercie in ſtore, for <hi>Revolters</hi> from Chriſtianitie
when they did repent; or, the <hi>Churches</hi> Power to grant <hi>Abſolution,</hi> or other
comfort ſpiritual, unto thoſe to whom ſhe might out of <hi>charitable diſcretion</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
God was merciful, or to whom God had not forbid her to ſhew mercy
or compaſſion. For Chriſt had commanded her to be merciful, as her
Heavenly Father is merciful.</p>
                  <p>But it were too much Charitie to preſume, that a man, of ſuch a proud and
turbulent Spirit, as <hi>Novatian</hi> was, (in the depth of ſuch diſcontent as took
poſſeſſion of his ſpirit, upon <hi>Cornelius</hi> his Preferment to ſo great a dignitie
as the <hi>Biſhoprick</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> unto his prejudice) would be conſtant to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<hi>Principles,</hi> either in whole, or in part: As either to grant, that God
had mercy in ſtore for <hi>Revolters,</hi> or that the <hi>Church</hi> had power to <hi>Abſolve</hi>
them upon ſuch ſignifications of repentance as belonged unto her <hi>Cognizance.</hi>
Nor, can we without breach of Charitie think, that either <hi>Novatian</hi> or any
other Heretick in thoſe times, would be ſo groſs as to deny the <hi>Churches Power</hi>
to <hi>Abſolve</hi> men from any ſinne, from which they were perſwaded God had
or would <hi>abſolve</hi> them. And it is a clear Caſe that the <hi>Novatians</hi> did ground
their Errour, or Contradiction to the <hi>Church</hi> wherein they lived, upon that
place of the Apoſtle, Heb. 6. 4, 5, 6. <hi>It is impoſsible for thoſe who were once
enlightened, and have taſted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of the
holy Ghoſt, And have taſted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to
come, if they fall away, to renue them again unto repentance; ſeeing they crucifie to
themſelves the Son of God afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame:</hi> and grounding their
Error, or maintaining it, by this place, it is evident, that they held <hi>Lapſos,</hi> or
<hi>Revolters from Chriſtianitie unto Heatheniſm, to be in the ſame eſtate, Which mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern

true meaning or extent of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> words in the forecited place, or how
the abſolute unpardonablneſs of ſin againſt <hi>the holy Ghoſt,</hi> may be thence
concluded, I have nothing for the preſent to ſay. It ſufficeth to know, that
this <hi>Error of the Novatians,</hi> was by the <hi>Ancient Church,</hi> wherein they lived,
<hi>Condemned</hi> for an <hi>Hereſie.</hi> Yet hence it will not follow, that their Hereſie (in
the Judgment of them which condemned it) did properly or preciſely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in denying the <hi>Churches authoritie to abſolve ſinnes</hi> of what kind ſoever;
but rather in avouching <hi>this particular ſin of Apoſtaſie or revolting from Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie,
to be in it ſelf unpardonable,</hi> or uncapable of Repentance. If it had been
in it ſelf <hi>unpardonable,</hi> or ſo adjudged by the <hi>Primitive Church: Navatian</hi> had
been no Heretick, in withſtanding <hi>Cornelius Biſhop of Rome</hi> and the particular
Churches which conſented with him, or in denying to admit the <hi>Revolters
from Chriſtianitie</hi> unto the eſtate or Condition of <hi>Penitentiaries</hi> in the Church;
or in refuſing to give them <hi>Abſolution,</hi> or to hold <hi>Communion</hi> with them, after
<pb n="3282" facs="tcp:100044:159"/>
they had voluntarily, or otherwiſe, obſerved ſuch a courſe of Life, as the
Church had appointed for <hi>Penitentiaries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That the <hi>Antient Church</hi> did neither admit open <hi>Revolters</hi> to enter into
this Courſe or Rule of life, nor <hi>Abſolve</hi> them after they had Uoluntarily,
though moſt ſtrictly (to the eyes of men) obſerved it, doth no way
argue that the Church in which <hi>Cornelius</hi> lived, (or which lived after him)
did erre, much leſſe incurre the Cenſure of hereſie which <hi>Novatian</hi> objected
unto them, in admitting open Revolters unto the eſtate and <hi>Condition of
Penitentiaries,</hi> or in abſolving them from their ſinnes after performance
of ſuch religious duties, as were by the Church required of men admitted
into that eſtate or <hi>Condition.</hi>

The <hi>Church</hi> in later times did onely alter the <hi>Practiſe</hi> or diſcipline (as is to
be preſumed) upon good cauſe or conſideration. And to conclude or
limit the Authoritie of the preſent <hi>Church,</hi> onely by <hi>Matter of fact,</hi> or practiſe
of the <hi>Church</hi> in former times, is matter of <hi>Hereſie,</hi> at leaſt of <hi>Schiſm.</hi> And
this it may be was a <hi>Branch</hi> (but not the <hi>Root)</hi> of <hi>Novatian's Hereſie.</hi> His
<hi>Radical Errour</hi> or Hereſie was, in juſtifying the practiſe of the former <hi>Church,</hi>
and in <hi>Condemning</hi> the reſolution of the <hi>Church</hi> wherein he and <hi>Cornelius</hi>
lived, by the fore-cited place of our Apoſtle, Heb. 6. Or, by his miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of it, that God would not be mercifull unto ſuch as in time of
perſecution had denyed <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and either by word or practiſe approved
the rites of the heathens: This <hi>Sin</hi> of Revolt indeed was a foul and griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
ſin, yet not a-like foul and grievous in all that were guiltie of it. But
Even the fouleſt ſin that can be imagined is but a work of the Divel, and
there is no work which the Divel can work in man ſo foul, which the <hi>Son
of God,</hi> who was <hi>manifeſted to this purpoſe that he might diſſolve the workes of
the Divel,</hi> is not able to diſſolve. Onely the full meaſure of ſin, or of
obſtinate continuance in foul and grievous ſinnes, is excluded from repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
or other benefits of Chriſts Paſſion. Nor is the ſin againſt the <hi>Holy
Ghoſt,</hi> for its kind or qualitie unpardonable, but becauſe it is alwayes a <hi>Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptom</hi>
of the full meaſure of ſin, or of obſtinate and unrelenting continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
in ſome ſinfull courſe of life.</p>
                  <p>3. But even this <hi>Fundamental Truth [That no ſin for it's nature or qualitie
is unpardonable]</hi> through the bad diſpoſition of men hath yeilded Nutriment
to an errour ſo lately ſprung up, that it is not as yet condemned for an hereſie,
though in it ſelf as damnable as <hi>Novatian's</hi> Error was. The Error is this,
<hi>[That Every ſin which ſome ſort of men commit, is pardoned before it be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.]</hi>
for ſo the Authors or mainteiners of this Errour argue. <q>If Every
ſin, eſpecially every groſſer ſin, which <hi>the Elect</hi> or men regenerate do
commit, were not forgiven, through the Merits of Chriſts <hi>Paſſion:</hi> the
<hi>Elect</hi> themſelves or men regenerate, might <hi>Totally</hi> or <hi>Finally fall from
Grace,</hi> ſeeing every ſin in its nature deſerveth Everlaſting death.</q> But
that the <hi>Elect</hi> or men regenerate may either <hi>Totally</hi> or <hi>Finally fall from Grace,</hi>
or be for the preſent in ſtate of condemnation, is the utmoſt Abſurditie
or inconvenience, which, in Divinitie, they ſeek to bring their Oppoſites
unto.</p>
                  <p>Not to trouble the Church with diſcuſſion of the <hi>Antecedent, [Whether the
Elect or regenerate may fall from Grace either totally or finally]</hi> the <hi>Argument</hi>
or <hi>Conſequence</hi> is worth the <hi>traverſing,</hi> to wit, <hi>[Whether it being granted, that
<pb n="3283" facs="tcp:100044:159"/>
neither the Elect nor men regenerate can fall from Grace, we muſt by neceſſary
Conſequence grant, that the ſins which men Elect or regenerate do after their rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration
commit be actually or in particular forgiven before the actuall commiſſion
of them:]</hi> or, <hi>[Whether it were not much better to grant, That men Regenerate
might fall from Grace, then that their ſinnes be in particular forgiven before
they be actually committed by them; If the Connexion of theſe two were ſo infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible,
that there were a neceſſitie of granting both, by granting one.]</hi> Unto
this <hi>Querie</hi> our <hi>Anſwer</hi> is, That if the impoſſibilitie of <hi>falling from Grace</hi>
after regeneration, cannot be mainteined without Suppoſal or <hi>Grant,
That their ſinnes are forgiven, before they be committed;</hi> or that God hath
as it were <hi>ante-dated a Pardon</hi> for them in particular, from the houre of
Chriſts paſſion; the medicine would be much worſe than the diſeaſe for
which it is ſought. This very Conceipt or perſwaſion, that our ſinnes
ſhould be forgiven before they be committed, will do the ſoul which harb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours
it greater harm <hi>than a Totall falling from Grace</hi> could do it. For <hi>a Totall
falling from Grace,</hi> doth neither argue nor occaſion juſt deſpair of pardon
upon repentance; whereas the miſperſwaſion or prejudicate opinion, <hi>that
our ſinnes are pardoned before they be committed,</hi> will neceſſarily puffe up our
ſoules with preſumption, whoſe ſwelling impoſtumations are no leſſe dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
than the wounds of deſpair. Though moſt <hi>Popes</hi> with their followers,
blaſphemouſly teach, that with what Facts ſoever God himſelf at any
time hath diſpenſed, every <hi>Pope,</hi> for the time being, may diſpenſe with
the ſame; and that he may pardon every ſin ſo far and in ſuch manner, as
God the Father and God the Son have pardoned the like: yet ſome latter
<hi>Popes</hi> upon ſuite made to them, have made a <hi>Demurre,</hi> whether God at
any time ſince the creation, did grant a Pardon or diſpenſation for any Fact
before it was committed, which without pardon or diſpenſation was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable,
or in its nature damnable. And upon this ſcruple or Demurr
have denyed to <hi>Ante-date any diſpenſation for thoſe</hi> Facts or practiſes which
their predeceſſors had condemned for heynous ſinnes, unto thoſe perſons
whoſe welfare and ſecurity from temporal danger they much tendred,
and unto whom they ſhewed themſelves willing to grant a Pardon for thoſe
very practiſes <hi>Post factum,</hi> which they would not pardon or diſpence with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all
before they were committed. <hi>So that to deliver it as a point of Orthodoxal
Doctrin, that God doth freely and abſolutely pardon any particular ſinnes,
even of his Elect and deareſt children before they be committed by them, is an
Errour which tranſcends, the Licentiouſneſs of Poperie; a Licentiouſneſs which
for degrees and malignitie exceedes the contrary rigorous Novatian errour,
which denyes poſſibilitie of Pardon unto ſome groſſer ſinnes, as unto Relapſe unto
Idolatry.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>4. Yet is this licentious Errour but a particular branch, and not the worſt
branch of that Fundamental or radical Errour before mentioned, which
makes, or ſtrives to make the <hi>Individual Nature ſubſtance</hi> or <hi>Entitie,</hi> that
is in one word,<note place="margin">See his <hi>Anſwer</hi> to Mr. B.</note> the <hi>Bare perſons</hi> of men, the <hi>Immediate Object</hi> of the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent
irreſiſtible and immutable <hi>Decree,</hi> concerning <hi>Election</hi> and <hi>Reprobation.</hi>
The manner how this <hi>Licentious Errour</hi> of <hi>Ante-dating Pardons</hi> for ſinnes,
ſprings from this Poyſonous Root, is conſpicuous and palpable. <hi>Firſt</hi>
the <hi>Decree of God,</hi> as all grant, is altogether <hi>immutable</hi> and <hi>irreſiſtible:</hi> and
<hi>Secondly</hi> the <hi>Individual Nature</hi> or Eſſence of every man, that is, his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
perſon, is, though not irreſiſtible, yet indiviſible and <hi>immutable,</hi>
It changeth not with the conditions or diſpoſitions of men. For though a
man of a young Saint become an old Divel, though of a civil ſober and
<pb n="3284" facs="tcp:100044:160"/>
peaceable man he become a ryotous, unruly, ſeditious man, yet he ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines
the <hi>ſame perſon</hi> he was: he cannot plead in Courts of humane juſtice,
that it was another partie, not he, which committed the miſdemeanors for
which he is queſtioned. Though his qualities or conditions alter, yet his
Subſtance or Perſon alters not; whence, if <hi>Gods immutable decree of Reprobation
or Election</hi> were immediately terminated unto mens <hi>Individual Natures</hi> or
Subſtances, that is, if he had abſolutely decreed to reward ſome particular
men with everlaſting Bliſs, and others with everlaſting miſerie, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
unto their works: this <hi>Conſequence</hi> would be immutable, infallible,
irreſiſtible. <q>Let the one ſort live as they liſt, in Adulterie, Theft, and
Murder, they ſhould be ſaved. Let the others do what they can, ſell all
that they have and give it to the poor, faſt and pray moſt dayes in the
week, they ſhould be damned; yea the Evill deeds of the one ſhould be
forgiven before they were committed; the others good works, or abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
from Evill works, ſhould not be capable of pardon; for as <hi>Election</hi>
unto life Eternal, if it were terminated to mens perſons (without reſpect
unto their works) doth include not only a <hi>general Ante-dated Pardon</hi> for all
the ſins they can commit, but priviledgeth them alſo from all queſtion; ſo
doth <hi>Reprobation</hi> include an utter excluſion from all hope of Pardon,
what courſe of life ſoever they take, if ſo be it were Terminated to their
Perſons or Entities, without reſpect unto their works.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Orthodoxal Truth then is, that God hath decreed to reward every man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
unto all his works, not according to the foreſight of his individual Nature or Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</hi>
And though it be true, that it is impoſſible for any man to fall from
the eſtate of <hi>Election</hi> into the eſtate of <hi>Reprobation,</hi> and as impoſſible for any
man to aſeend or be tranſported from the eſtate of <hi>Reprobation</hi> unto the eſtate
of <hi>Election:</hi> Yet is it not alike impoſſible for him that is for the time preſent
in a <hi>Middle State</hi> betwixt both, that is, a man capable of Gods promiſes in
Chriſt and yet lyable to his Judgments, either to proceed unto the eſtate of
<hi>Election,</hi> or to fall into the ſtate of <hi>Reprobation.</hi> There is a neceſſitie that every
<hi>Elected man</hi> ſhall be ſaved, that every <hi>man Reprobated</hi> ſhall be damned, but no
like neceſſitie by the Eternal decree, that <hi>This</hi> or <hi>That</hi> particular man ſhall
attain to the ſtate of <hi>Election,</hi> or fall into the ſtate of <hi>Reprobation.</hi> Their
works or meaſure of working whether well or ill, their faith or want of faith,
the meaſure &amp; manner of both, are not ſo immutable or unchangable as their
natures or perſons are. Now <hi>Gods immutable Decree</hi> doth infallibly reward
them according to the meaſure, manner, or qualitie of their works, or of their
faith or infidelitie. For albeit the Works or Acts of mans Faith be Mutable,
yet Gods purpoſe of rewarding every man according to his works or diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
meaſure of faith or infidelity is moſt Immutable.</p>
                  <p>5. But albeit God do not Ante-date any pardon in particular for the ſinnes
of the <hi>Elect,</hi> is it ſafe hence to conclude that he is not more favourable unto
them than unto other men? or doth his peculiar favour to <hi>them,</hi> (being
granted,) conclude him to be an accepter of Perſons? ſurely it would; if
we did maintain that his <hi>Eternal Decree</hi> for ſhewing peculiar favour and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
towards the <hi>Elect,</hi> did reſpect only mens Perſons or Individual ſubſtances;
But, laying <hi>this Foundation, [That God from Eternitie hath Decreed to reward
every man, not according to the previſion of his Individual Manhood or ſubſtance,
but according to all his works:]</hi> Gods peculiar favour may without imputation
of partialitie or acceptance of perſons, be extended not to the <hi>Elect</hi> only, but
unto all that are <hi>within the Covenant,</hi> unto all that without Hypocriſie or ſini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter
reſpects, have ſubſcribed unto it. Yet though this peculiar favour be to
<pb n="3285" facs="tcp:100044:160"/>
be extended to all within the <hi>Covenant,</hi> we may not deny, but that it reaches
the <hi>Elect</hi> in an extraordinary meaſure; for ordinarily none are admitted into
the number of the <hi>Elect,</hi> which have not done ſome works which others, not
of that number, have not done. And if God out of his free bountie, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
not the men but their works, more bountifully, than he doth the works
of other men, whoſe perſons are not within his <hi>Covenant,</hi> whoſe works are
not ſo capable of bountie: he cannot hence be conceived to be a <hi>Reſpecter of
Perſons,</hi> but <hi>an accepter of ſuch in every Nation as work righteouſneſs,</hi> or do leſs
evill then others do. The works which <hi>St. Peter</hi> requires <hi>to the making of
our Election ſure,</hi> are all in their Nature and qualitie Good, all, parts of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;
and though we cannot do them aright; yet ſuch as hope to be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of Gods peculiar favour, muſt be induſtrious in doing them. But not
theſe works only, but even our Subſcription unto the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> our
Profeſſion of being Chriſts Diſciples, is a work capable of mercy, of peculiar
favour (in reſpect of others which neglect this <hi>Covenant)</hi> though <hi>No work
meritorious of Grace,</hi> or of better abilities to proceed in Chriſtianitie; nor
are the beſt works of the <hi>Elect</hi> in their nature ſuch.</p>
                  <p>6.<note place="margin">Gods grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs to the Elect, and his reſpect to their good works.</note> 
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> the good Works which He doth that is <hi>within the Covenant</hi> are
more capable of reward than the like works of men which are without the
<hi>Covenant:</hi> and yet the good works of the <hi>Elect</hi> are more capable of reward
then the beſt works of him that is only <hi>within the Covenant,</hi> not in the
ſtate of <hi>Election,</hi> not confirmed in Grace. <hi>Secondly,</hi> the good Works of men
<hi>within the Covenant</hi> do facilitate their progreſs towards Grace, and lengthen
their poſſibilities of being confirmed in Grace. The good works of the <hi>Elect</hi> do
more then ſtrengthen their preſent eſtate in Grace, they make them capable
of greater Glorie, than others <hi>Elect</hi> are, which work not after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
or meaſure as they do. But leaving the <hi>Elect</hi> and their works to God, who
only knowes them: the good works of ſuch as are <hi>within the Covenant,</hi> though
as yet not confirmed in Grace, do in ſome degree ſhelter them from danger of
<hi>final Apoſtaſie</hi> or of excluſion from Grace. The more good Works ſuch
men have done, the better fruits of Faith they have ſhewed, the firmer they
ſtand in the day of temptation, wherein the Fruitleſſe hearer ſhall fall. Thus
much is included in the Cloſe of our Apoſtles words, Heb. 6. ver. 7, 8. <hi>The
Earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs
meet for them by whom it is dreſſed, receiveth bleſsing from God. But that which bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth
thornes and bryers is rejected, and is nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
Theſe Hebrewes had come as neer to that ſhelf, upon which others had
made ſhipwrack of faith, as any men ſince have done, which have eſcapt it.
And if they had been to be judged by men according to their preſent Facts,
they had incurred that <hi>dreadful ſentence of final Rejection</hi> or Reprobation which
the Apoſtle there denounceth againſt backſliders. What then was the <hi>Sheet-anchor,</hi>
which, in our <hi>Apoſtles Divinitie,</hi> did hold them from ſtriking
againſt the immoveable rock of Reprobation? the Merits of their former
works? So ſome great Profeſſors of <hi>Romiſh Divinitie,</hi> do teach in their <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctures
de Reviviſcentia meritorum,</hi> that is of the <hi>Revival of merits, being dead or
abated by Relapſe or Backſliding.</hi> This <hi>Title</hi> they ground upon this very <hi>Text
of Scripture,</hi> being otherwiſe groundleſs, as they themſelves confeſſe. The
words of the Apoſtle are, ver. 9, 10. <hi>Beloved we are perſwaded better things
of you, and things that accompany ſalvation, though we thus ſpeak.</hi> For <hi>God is not
unrighteous, to forget your work and Labour of Love, which ye have ſhewed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards

been any injuſtice in God to have forgotten their former works? if it had, their
<pb n="3286" facs="tcp:100044:161"/>
works were truly <hi>meritorious,</hi> or capable of reward by plea of juſtice. For <hi>that
work unto which reward without injuſtice cannot be denyed, is meritorious,</hi> or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy

If he had ſo utterly excluded theſe <hi>Hebrews</hi> from entring into his <hi>Reſt,</hi> as he did
their Forefathers from entring into the land of Promiſe. For albeit their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

that is,<note place="margin">See Book 9. Ch. 12. Numb. 3.</note> not <hi>bountiful,</hi> or not <hi>merciful,</hi> to ſuch as are in miſerie. Though
works of pitie, of bountie, be not works of juſtice or equitie, yet ſometimes
he that ſhewes pitie or favour, though in Caſes wherein the poſitive Law of
God requireth Juſtice or ſevere execution, if the caſe come before the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate,
is ſaid to deal <hi>juſtly,</hi> that is, <hi>not rigorouſly, not hardly.</hi> So the <hi>Holy
Ghoſt</hi> (when he gives the reaſon why <hi>Joſeph</hi> did not ſeek publickly to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorced
from his eſpouſed wife <hi>THE BLESSED VIRGIN)</hi> ſaith, he did
thus reſolve, becauſe he was <hi>A Juſt Man,</hi> that is, a <hi>Courteous and mild-hearted
man:</hi> Not <hi>a juſt man according to ſtrict and Legal juſtice.</hi> For by the poſitive
Law of God, the crime which he ſuſpected, was puniſhable not with divorce
only, but with death. If <hi>Joſeph</hi> then in reſolving to put away his eſpouſed
wife privately, did the part of a <hi>juſt and upright man,</hi> he had been <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is,
an <hi>unjuſt man in our Apoſtles ſenſe,</hi> if he had reſolved to uſe the remedie or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of the Law. Yet can no man be ſaid ſtrictly or properly to be unjuſt
for uſing any lawful remedie, but <hi>non benignus,</hi> or <hi>non mitis;</hi> he may be ſaid
<hi>to deal rigorouſly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> or hardly, or uncourteouſly in uſing the extremitie of the
Law. To apply this Diſtinction to <hi>the Point</hi> in queſtion: If God had exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
theſe <hi>Hebrewes</hi> from entring into his <hi>Reſt,</hi> after they had accompliſhed
ſuch a meaſure of works as the Apoſtle there intimates, he had not been <hi>ſo
merciful</hi> and <hi>bountiful</hi> unto them, as the Scripture teacheth he is to all, he had
not ſhewed himſelf <hi>ſo gratious a Lord,</hi> nor given ſuch incouragements to his
other ſervants of not being wearie of weldoing, as he alwaies uſeth to do.
Briefly, when the Apoſtle ſaith <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, <hi>the Phraſe in the Original</hi> is as much
as if he had ſaid, <hi>ſo farr is God from being unjust, that you ſhall find him a moſt
gratious and Loving Father: ſo farr will he be from forgetting your works and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
of Love, ſo farr from cutting you off from entring into his Reſt, that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
you with his beſt bleſsings, even with the bleſsing of Salvation, however
your late backſlidings have deſerved the contrary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But however, God be a Gratious and loving Father to all that call upon
him, to all that are <hi>within his Covenant,</hi> but eſpecially to his <hi>Elect:</hi> albeit this
his Gratiouſneſs conſiſts in the not imputing or in remitting of their ſinnes,
yet is there not the leaſt ſinne, which any <hi>within his Covenant,</hi> or which any
of his <hi>Elect</hi> do commit, whoſe <hi>Pardon</hi> muſt not be ſought for, after the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of it, and muſt actually be obteined; otherwiſe they ſhould dye in
their ſinnes; for though the Son of God did take away the ſinnes of the
whole world, by his ſufferings upon the Croſſe: yet were no mans ſinnes ſo
taken away by him, or ſo diſſolv'd as that he from that time did ceaſe, or yet
doth ceaſe to <hi>diſſolve</hi> them; whenſoever they are committed, and their <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution,</hi>
by repentance ſought for. Unleſſe he did <hi>yet diſſolve the works of the

when he ſaith, <hi>If any man ſin we have an Advocate with the Father Jeſus Chriſt
the righteous. 1 John</hi> 2. 1. Now the Office of an <hi>Advocate</hi> is to plead
his <hi>Clients</hi> Cauſe before his Judge, as either for Juſtice if his Cauſe be good,
or for mercy or mitigation of Juſtice, if his <hi>Client</hi> be delinquent. God we
know is as well a God of Juſtice, as of mercy, and hath as well one ear
open to the <hi>Accuſations</hi> which are brought againſt us, as another attentive
to the <hi>Interceſſions,</hi> which are made for us. Satan is our profeſſed Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarie,
and, after he hath inticed us to do his work, he never ceaſeth to
ſollicit the Execution of Gods Juſtice or vengeance upon us. Not the
beſt of Gods Saints may at any time plead their own cauſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or ioyn this Iſſue
with him; <q>
                        <hi>Lord Let Juſtice be awarded with ſpeed, either for us or againſt us;
either let our Adverſarie be condemned for accuſing us falſely, or let us be
condemned with him, if we have done unjuſtly.</hi>
                     </q> This were to become not
our own <hi>Advocates</hi> (which yet were preſumption) but to turn Satans Solli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citors
even to ſuplicate for wo and vengeance upon our own ſoules. <hi>David</hi>
hath taught us the <hi>Form of our Plea</hi> with God, even whileſt we ſtand upon

righteous in thy ſight.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>9. But will the Almighty Judge of all the world be ſo unmindfull of
his Great <hi>Attribute,</hi> as to deny Execution of Judgement upon ſuch as have
deſerved it, being thereunto ſollicited and importuned by his profeſſed Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſarie?
or will <hi>The Son of God</hi> be ſo Partial as to plead for their acquittal
which confeſs themſelves <hi>Guiltie of the Crimes Objected?</hi> To this we <hi>Anſwer:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>1. God hath <hi>Two Covenants, One</hi> of Juſtice, <hi>Another</hi> of Mercy. And
albeit God The Father ſhould do <hi>us</hi> no wrong, no injuſtice, but do <hi>Himſelf</hi>
right, if he did, upon Every accuſation, inſtantly Condemn us: yet ſeeing
<hi>His Onely Son,</hi> hath by a full and alſufficient price, purchaſed a Reconciliation
for us; He may maintaine <hi>the plea of Juſtice,</hi> even before the Almighty
Judge, againſt our Adverſarie, for us: Or, (haveing ſatisfied <hi>the Juſtice of
God</hi> for all the ſinnes of mankinde) <hi>He</hi> may <hi>Remove our Tryal</hi> from the <hi>Barre
of Juſtice</hi> to <hi>the Throne of Grace</hi> and mercy. 2. Neither <hi>God the Father</hi>
could deny <hi>Execution</hi> of Juſtice upon us, nor could <hi>God the Son</hi> plead ſo
much as for our <hi>Reprival,</hi> if we ſhould ſtand upon our own integritie, or our
own Juſtification: ſo that Our <hi>Confeſſion</hi> of Guilt is ſo farre from doing
us preiudice, that it is a moſt neceſſary Condition of our Acquittal.</p>
                  <p>If God the Father then at any time (as hitherto at all times he hath
done) deferre the execution of Juſtice upon us, which our adverſarie dayly
ſollicites againſt us, he defers it at the <hi>Plea or Interceſſion</hi> of this our <hi>Advocate;</hi>
not for our own ſakes. And it is <hi>worth the noteing,</hi> that as the reaſon why
the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> will not have us ioyn iſſue with our adverſary in point of Juſtice,
is, becauſe <hi>No fleſh is righteous in Gods ſight;</hi> ſo our <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> to ſhew that <hi>our
Advocate</hi> though <hi>partaker with us of fleſh &amp; blood,</hi> is <hi>Exempted</hi> from this <hi>Vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Negative,</hi> enſtyles Him by the name of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.</hi> If
He were not righteous, even in Gods ſight, He could be no fitt <hi>Advocate,</hi>
to ſtand betwixt us and Gods Juſtice, to avert his Judgements from, and
draw down his mercy and bleſſing upon us.</p>
                  <p>But in reſpect of what ſinnes, is <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the Righteous</hi> ſaid, to be
our <hi>Advocate,</hi> an <hi>Advocate</hi> even for the <hi>Elect</hi> and regenerate? Is he their
<hi>Advocate,</hi> onely in reſpect of ſinnes committed <hi>before their regeneration,</hi>
or <hi>before their Confirmation in Grace?</hi> or an <hi>Advocate</hi> alſo for the remiſſion
of thoſe ſinnes which they have committed <hi>after their regeneration</hi> by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
or <hi>after the increaſe of Juſtifying or ſanctifying Grace,</hi> whether pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
<pb n="3288" facs="tcp:100044:162"/>
by receiving of Chriſts Body and Blood or by other meanes? If our
<hi>Advocate</hi> he were onely in reſpect of ſinnes committed <hi>before Baptiſm,</hi> or of
ſinnes inherent by nature, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> had not ſaid, <hi>If any man ſin we have
an Advocate,</hi> but if any <hi>man hath ſinned he hath an Advocate.</hi> or, <hi>Interceſſion
is alreadie made for him by his Advocate.</hi> The <hi>title</hi> which he beſtowes upon
his Diſciples <hi>[Little Children]</hi> argues them to have been, in his eſteem, men
regenerate, and more free (as he hoped) from ordinary ſinnes, than
other men, at the leaſt he wrote unto them, to the end that they ſhould not ſin
after they had been cleanſed from their ſinnes, but yet he addes <hi>[if any man
ſhall hereafter fall into any ſin, We</hi> (He ſaith not, YOU; as takeing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
included in the number of thoſe which ſtood in need of <hi>Advocation)
have an Advocate with the Father Jeſus Chriſt the righteous.]</hi> This implyes
that Chriſt doth not ceaſe to execute the <hi>Office</hi> of an <hi>Advocate</hi> for the rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate,
ſo long as they live here on earth. For it is not the <hi>Office of any
Advocate,</hi> to plead for the remiſſion of thoſe ſinnes, which are alreadie
remitted, or from which he knowes his <hi>Clients</hi> to be <hi>cleare</hi> exempted, before
they have committed them. If then the ſon of God make interceſſion for
the ſinnes of the <hi>Elect</hi> or regenerate, whileſt they live here on earth, their
ſinnes are not remitted, untill <hi>He</hi> have made interceſſion for them, nor doth
<hi>He</hi> intercede for actual ſinnes till after they be committed.</p>
                  <p>10. However, if the Son of God be our <hi>Advocate</hi> onely unto God the
Father,<note place="margin">It is the <hi>Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate's</hi> Office to <hi>plead</hi> for pardon: The <hi>Iudge</hi> which hath <hi>Power.</hi>
                     </note> whether in reſpect of ſinnes paſt or now preſent, <hi>He as Advocate,</hi>
doth onely <hi>plead</hi> our <hi>Pardon,</hi> It is <hi>God the Father,</hi> then, which <hi>muſt grant</hi> the
<hi>Pardon;</hi> and if every ſin be a work of Satan: the pardoning of ſin is the
<hi>Diſſolution</hi> or deſtruction of the work of Satan. How then is it ſaid that
<hi>the Son of God doth deſtroy or deſſolve the workes of Satan in us?</hi> As the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty
Father is ſaid to have made the world, for <hi>he ſpake the word and it
was made,</hi> yet he made it by <hi>the Eternal Word his Onely Son:</hi> ſo albeit the
Father likewiſe, do give the <hi>Fiat</hi> or <hi>Warrant,</hi> that our ſinnes may be remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
or that the workes of Satan may be <hi>diſſolved</hi> in us, yet they muſt be
<hi>diſſolved</hi> by the Son, as immediatly by the Son as the world was Created
by the Son.<note place="margin">1 Iob. 2. 1, 2.</note> For this reaſon the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the forecited place doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
himſelf with the onely Title of <hi>Advocate,</hi> but adds withall, <hi>that he is the
Propitiation for our ſinnes, and not for ours onely, but for the ſinnes of the whole
world.</hi> He ſaith not, (though that be moſt true) <hi>He hath made the Propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
for our ſin;</hi> leſt haply any man ſhould hence collect, that all
his ſinnes were forgiven before they were committed, becauſe the <hi>Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation</hi>
was made for them before they were committed. For albeit the
Propitiatorie Sacrifice was of value infinite and all-ſufficient for the full ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom
of the World: yet is it not ſufficient for us which believe, that <hi>Chriſt</hi>
dyed for us to look onely upon the <hi>Propitiation</hi> which he then <hi>Made</hi> for us
(for that is paſt) but upon himſelf as he <hi>ſtill continues the propitiation</hi> for
our ſinnes; ſo ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle, He is the propitiation for our ſinnes;</hi> not onely
an <hi>Advocate</hi> to plead for us unto his Father, that our ſinnes may be remitted,
but this requeſt being granted, he is withall the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> which muſt
remit them; and not our high prieſt onely, but the <hi>Propitiation</hi> by which
Every work of Satan in us muſt immediately be <hi>diſſolved.</hi> Again, though
all unto whom St. <hi>John</hi> wrote this Epiſtle, were not regenerate, yet it is
certaine that all ſuch as walk in the light are regenerate; yet ſaith St. <hi>John
Chap. 1. 7. If we walk in the light as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip
one with another; and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son—,</hi> what hath it done?
<hi>Cleanſed us from all our ſinnes.</hi> Though that be in a good ſenſe moſt true,
<pb n="3289" facs="tcp:100044:162"/>
yet our <hi>Apoſtle</hi> doth not <hi>So</hi> ſpeak, Leſt haply ſuch as had attained unto this
Communion of Saints, or participation with the Children of Light, being
thus farre cleanſed by Chriſts bloud, might take occaſion to think, that all
their ſinnes, aſwel thoſe that are to come, as thoſe which were paſt, were
already pardoned by him, or that they were as truly cleanſed from the guilt
of ſinnes future, as of ſins already committed &amp; paſt. But the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> (making
himſelf one of the number to whom he ſpeaks) ſays, <hi>If WE walk in the light,
the bloud of Ieſus Chriſt cleanſeth us from all ſin,</hi> that is, it never ceaſeth to cleanſe
the <hi>Elect</hi> or regenerate from the ſins which they never ceaſe, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
or other, to committ, or harbour in them. And if there were not a
perpetual Remiſſion of our ſinnes, or if this cleanſing us from our ſinnes by
the bloud of Chriſt were not as perpetual and continual as our Commiſſion
of ſinne is, our Caſe, even the Caſe of men regenerate, would be Lamentable.
So farre is it from truth, that the ſinnes of any man be forgiven before they
be committed, or that any man is by the bloud of Chriſt actually cleanſed
from thoſe ſinnes which as yet have not actually polluted his ſoul and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence,
that, as bad Diet caſts men into a Relapſe of thoſe diſeaſes from which
they had been lately cured, ſo the ſinnes which we commit this hour, will
call our former ſinnes to remembrance in Gods ſight, until theſe later as well
as the former be actually forgiven, or untill we be actually cleanſed from
theſe later by the bloud of <hi>Christ.</hi> I ſhould now proceed unto the manner
how the Son of God doth diſſolve thoſe works which Satan worketh in us
after Baptiſm or regeneration, or how we are actually cleanſed from
ſinne by his bloud:</p>
                  <p>11.<note place="margin">The Error of the ſacrifice of the Maſs.</note> But here again I find the Truth beſett with <hi>Two Errors or Extremes,</hi> the
<hi>One Poſitive,</hi> or an <hi>Hereſie</hi> maintained by the Romiſh Church, which in <hi>effect</hi>
denies the <hi>infinite value</hi> or everlaſting <hi>Efficacie</hi> of <hi>Chriſts</hi> bloudy Sacrifice
upon the Croſſe: The <hi>Other Extreme</hi> is an <hi>Incogitancy</hi> of ſome men which
magniſie the everlaſting <hi>Efficacie</hi> or infinite <hi>value</hi> of Chriſts Bloudie Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
not too much (for ſo they cannot) but amiſs: they make it everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<hi>after ſuch a manner,</hi> or rather make <hi>ſuch uſe</hi> or application of its everlaſting
<hi>Efficacie</hi> or infinite <hi>value,</hi> to themſelves and to their hearers, as makes his
<hi>Everlaſting Prieſthood,</hi> to be uſeleſſe, or needleſſe. To begin with the Firſt
Error or Extreme.</p>
                  <p>Is it poſſible, that, <hi>That Church which challengeth the Title of Catholick as her
own peculiar, ſhould deny the moſt Fundamental Article of Catholick Faith,</hi> as is
the everlaſting <hi>Efficacie</hi> or infinite <hi>value</hi> of Chriſts Bloudie Sacrifice?</p>
                  <p>In expreſſe terms, or directly, ſhe doth not deny it, Her Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
dare not profeſſe the denyal of it. For ſo moſt of their Faction whom
they lead blindfold, would forſake them, as Hereticks and Aliens from the
Antient and Orthodoxal Church Yet the more ſtifly the greateſt Scholars
in that Church deny the imputation or Charge which we lay upon them; the
better proof we ſhall gain from them, that they are the men, which, as the
Apoſtle ſaith, are given over <hi>to believe Lyes;</hi> that they are the men, on
whoſe ſoules the <hi>ſpirit of deluſion</hi> hath ſeazed; If we ſhall decypher the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
or <hi>Character of that ſpirit</hi> ſo clearly, that every one, which is not
ſworn to their Faction, whether <hi>Jew, Mahumetan, or Heathen,</hi> or other more
indifferent, though but indued with <hi>Common Reaſon,</hi> may run and read it.
Let us ſee then how they expoſe the greateſt Myſteries of our Salvation,
unto the juſt ſcorn and deriſion of the <hi>lew, Mahumetan, or Heathen,</hi> without
poſſibilitie of Apologie for their manifeſt contradicting the <hi>Principles</hi>
not of <hi>Chriſtianitie</hi> only, but of <hi>Common Reaſon.</hi> Thus you may imagine
<pb n="3290" facs="tcp:100044:163"/>
any <hi>Iewiſh School-Boy</hi> or young Artiſt Catechized in the Rudiments of his
own Religion would oppoſe the greateſt Rabbines in the Romiſh
Church. <q>We of the Jewiſh Nation, once had our ordinary Prieſts which
offered ſacrifices daily in the temple, we had our high Prieſt which went
into the <hi>moſt holy place</hi> once a year, with the bloud of the Anniverſary and
ſolemn ſacrifices; ye Chriſtian Catholicks (ſo ye term your ſelves) teach
your hearers, as your <hi>Apoſtle</hi> hath taught you, that the beſt ſacrifices which
our Fathers uſed were but <hi>Shadowes</hi> fore-ſignifying the taking away of ſin,
they did not, they could not take away ſins, or cleanſe the conſciences of ſuch
as offered them; And why could not our ſacrifices take away ſin? your
Apoſtle gives this Reaſon, <hi>becauſe they were often offered,</hi> Heb. 10. ver. 1. 2.
&amp;c. <hi>Ye Chriſtian Catholicks</hi> have your high Prieſt, who, as ye ſay, offered
himſelf up in bloudy ſacrifice unto God for your ſinnes; was this his
ſacrifice perfect, or was it not? Did it take away ſinnes more perfectly then
the ſacrifices which our Fathers uſed, or did it not? ye ſay, <hi>It did,</hi> we ſay
<hi>It did not,</hi> it could not: if your <hi>Apoſtles Principles</hi> or Expoſitions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
be true, and your practiſe not falſe or unlawful. Your Prieſts (as you
confeſs) ſtand daily miniſtring and offering the ſame ſacrifice, which your
high <hi>Prieſt</hi> did offer, and therefore by your Apoſtles argument againſt us,
and by your practiſe, this ſacrifice can never take away ſinne: it is more the
ſame ſacrifice than the ſacrifices of the Law were, And yet it is offered oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
and in more places than any Legal ſacrifices were.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>12. Some devoted to the Romiſh religion will perhaps ſay in their
hearts; the Doctors of our Church know well enough how to untye theſe
knots, which the <hi>Iewes</hi> caſt; albeit ſo learnedly and ſo ſubtilly, that no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned
man can perceive how they untye them. If men will thus believe
or rely upon their Teachers skill without any true experiment of it; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
help it. Yet if you will believe me upon the <hi>faith of a Chriſtian,</hi> I never yet
could ſee any Romiſh Writer, which leaves not the <hi>former knot</hi> worſe then he
found it, after he had uſed all the paines and skill he had to untwiſt it. The
wiſeſt and moſt learned of them, uſually let it ſlide away without medling.
Many of you perhaps have read what the Rhemiſts in their Notes upon the
tenth to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> have attempted, To make you believe that all is looſe:
The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> (ſay they) <hi>ſpeakes of the ſacrifices of the Law, not of the ſacrifice of the
Maſs.</hi> It is true indeed, he ſpeakes of the ſacrifices of the Law, for he proves
them to be unperfect, unſufficient: but he proves them to be unſufficient by
ſuch a Reaſon as will conclude more ſtrongly, not only againſt the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
of the Maſs, (if ſo the ſacrifice of the Maſſe, were as lawfull as the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal
ſacrifices ſometimes were, or the Reiteration of it, not more abominable
in the ſight of God, then the reſtauration of Legal bloudie ſacrifices at this

even whileſt they were lawfully uſed and according to Gods ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
to have been altogether unſufficient for taking away ſinne, is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were to be <hi>often offered:</hi> Now <hi>every particular muſt be proved by an

<hi>imperfect</hi> for this <hi>Reaſon,</hi> that they were <hi>often offered,</hi> unleſs this <hi>Vniverſal</hi> were
true and taken by him as granted, <hi>[That no ſacrifices or ſacrifice of what kind ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
which is often offered can be perfect or ſufficient to take away ſinnes.]</hi> This <hi>uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
Reaſon</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> takes as granted by <hi>Light of Nature</hi> and Common
<pb n="3291" facs="tcp:100044:163"/>
Reaſon, and ſo frames his <hi>Argument</hi> from the Authoritie of <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and the
conſonancie of <hi>Common Reaſon</hi> or light of nature, ver. 15. The <hi>Holy Ghoſt
ALSO is witneſſe,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It is as idle and as frivolous a ſhift wherewith the ſame Rhemiſts ſeek to put
off their ignorant Readers, when they tell them, that, <hi>Chriſts body was but
once offered up in a bloudy manner, but may and ought to be often offered up in a bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
manner.</hi> The very root and ground of this diſtinction if you examine
it by our Apoſtles Argument, includes a confeſſion or acknowledgement
of the CRIME or HERESIE which we object unto them,
to wit, that The bloudy Sacrifice of the Son of God, is not by their
doctrine of infinite value, nor of force and vertue everlaſting, but infinite
only <hi>ſecundum quid, (i. e.)</hi> infinite in the Nature of a bloudie ſacrifice, not ſo
ſimply infinite as to exclude all other ſacrifice or offering for ſin. For if it

                  <p>His words, ver. 1, 2, are theſe. <hi>The Law can never, with thoſe ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
which they offered year by year continually, make the commers thereunto perfect;
For then would they not have ceaſed to be offered, becauſe the worſhippers, (that is,
ſuch as were obſervers of the Legal worſhip only;) ſhould have had no more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience
of ſin.</hi> From this <hi>Oppoſition</hi> between the condition of Gods people
under the <hi>Law,</hi> and the Condition of his people under the <hi>New Covenant,</hi>
that is, of ſuch as worſhip him <hi>not by Legal Sacrifices, but in the Spirit,</hi> it may
ſeem to be concluded, that ſuch as are within the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> or <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
him in ſpirit,</hi> have their Sinnes remitted before they can commit them, or
as ſoon as they begin to worſhip God, not by <hi>Legal ſacrifices,</hi> but <hi>in the ſpirit.</hi>
For if the ſins of men thus qualified were not remitted before they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
into the <hi>Covenant of Grace,</hi> or at leaſt at the time when they were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
admitted, they ſhould at leaſt have as much (if not more) <hi>Conſcience

                  <p>The <hi>Former,</hi> That the <hi>Legal Worſhippers</hi> were conſcious of ſin in ſuch a ſort

farr the <hi>Evangelical worſhippers</hi> have none; In what ſort, meaſure, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
God did remember the ſinnes of his people under <hi>the Old Covenant,</hi>
and not remember the ſinnes of his people under <hi>the new Covenant of
Grace,</hi> we can have no better ſcantling, no more indifferent ſtandard, than the
words of the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the ſame tenth Chapter, ver. 3. But <hi>in thoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices</hi>
(to wit which were offered by the Law,) <hi>there is a remembrance</hi> (or
commemoration) <hi>of ſin made every year.</hi> But wherein did this <hi>Annual</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
or <hi>Commemoration</hi> of ſin conſiſt? The Law, as the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where

this <hi>School-maſter,</hi> did, by the Annual, or other, bloudie ſacrifices eſpecially,
teach, were theſe: <q>That the men, by whom or for whom theſe bloudie
ſacrifices were offered, had deſerved, and as often as they offered them did
deſerve, to be tormented and mangled as theſe ſacrifices were. That the

or diverting the puniſhment</hi> from themſelves upon theſe bruit Beaſts: That
whiles the fire under Gods Altar did continue, Gods Wrath againſt ſinne
and ſinners vvas not appeaſed, nor could be appeaſed by this kind of bloudy
ſacrifices.</q> All this the yearly and daily offering of bloudy ſacrifices, did
clearly teſtifie unto the conſciences of ſuch as offered them. And that ſo
often as God required theſe ſacrifices, he did <hi>call their ſins unto remembrance,</hi>
and as it vvere by matter of Fact proclaim unto the World, that as yet, his
Wrath againſt ſin vvas not, could not be appeaſed, by theſe or the like kind
of Sacrifices. But inaſmuch as the Law, though in it-ſelf imperfect (and
therefore could make nothing <hi>perfect)</hi> vvas yet an <hi>Introduction to a better Hope;</hi>
the continual reiteration or repetition of theſe bloudy ſacrifices did teach
ſuch as uſed them aright, to expect a more ſufficient bloudy ſacrifice, vvhich
ſhould fully appeaſe the vvrath of God, and Teſtifie unto mens conſciences,
<hi>that he did remember their ſins no more,</hi> in ſuch ſort as during the time of the
Law he had done; that is, there ſhould be no more exchange or commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of puniſhment, no <hi>ſolemn remembrance</hi> of ſinne, by any ſacrifice (of what

                  <p>4. That we may aſcend by degrees unto the <hi>infinite value</hi> and <hi>everlaſting
Effi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>acie</hi> of the ſacrifice of the <hi>ſonne of God,</hi> we are in the firſt place to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the odds or difference between this only Sacrifice and the ſacrifices of the
Law. The odds or differences between them may be reduced unto theſe
<hi>Two Heads: Firſt,</hi> To the Diverſitie of their immediate Effects: <hi>Secondly,</hi>
To their different Efficacie or proportion for effecting the ſeveral Ends to
which they were eſpecially deſtinated. 1. The <hi>Immediate effect</hi> of the bloudy
<pb n="3294" facs="tcp:100044:165"/>
Sacrifices of the Law, was to cleanſe or purifie the offerers from ſinnes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
againſt the Law of Ceremonies, and this (as the Apoſtle termes
it) was a <hi>Purification</hi> or <hi>Sanctification according to the fleſh.</hi> Howbeit, this
Sanctification was a ſhadow or picture of that purification of the Conſcience
or Sanctification of the Spirit, which was to be effected by the bloody Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
<hi>of the Son of God.</hi> 2. The ſacrifices of the Law were no way ſo
Powerfull or ſufficient for effecting <hi>the Sanctifying of the fleſh,</hi> as the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
of the Son of God is for effecting the Sanctification of the ſpirit and
Conſcience. There was <hi>no one kind</hi> of Legal ſacrifices, which might make
a full attonement for all ſinnes or ſinners againſt the Law of Ceremonies.
For every different ſin or legal uncleanneſs they had (for the moſt part) a
different kind of ſacrifice or offering. And if a man had been this day
cleanſed by ſacrifice from ſome particular ſin or legal uncleanneſs, and had
fallen again unto the like to morrow, the blood of the former ſacrifice could
not ſtead him the ſecond time: Every particular relaps into the ſame ſin,
was to have a particular offering or freſh Sacrifice, though of the ſame kind
with the former.</p>
                  <p>5. The <hi>infinite value</hi> of the Bloody Sacrifice of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> may,
from this imperfection of the legall ſacrifices, be diſtinctly apprehended,
if we conſider, that not the <hi>Jew</hi> onely but the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> one and other,
were Enemies and rebells againſt God, all by nature the ſonnes of wrath
and perdition, and yet the favour of reconciliation for all that then were,
or afterwards ſhould be (albeit this world ſhould continue a million of
years) was purchaſed <hi>by this one bloody Sacrifice,</hi> as by a juſt and full price.
What ſinnes ſoever any man had committed, they did not prejudice his <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
in the pardon</hi> purchaſed; it was univerſal in reſpect of al ſinners, and
in reſpect of all ſinnes; The Almighty Father's wrath againſt mankind, was
by this <hi>Onely Sacrifice</hi> ſo well appeaſed, ſo fully ſatisfied, that he is ready
to receive all into the favour and <hi>Privilege of ſonnes,</hi> which will with due
reverence accept of the <hi>Pardon</hi> offered, and ſue it out by ſuch meanes as he
hath appointed. Now this <hi>Vniverſal Favour, for all men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> to whom nothing
but vengeance was in Juſtice due, could not poſſibly be purchaſed by any
Sacrifice, which was not <hi>of Value abſolutely infinite.</hi> But to grant an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
<hi>Pardon,</hi> not onely for all ſinnes paſt, before the acceptance of the
<hi>Pardon,</hi> but for willfull obſtinacie or continuance in ſinne or rebellion after
ſo Gratious a Proclamation of <hi>Pardon,</hi> could be no <hi>Effect</hi> of Gods infinite
Mercy, no <hi>Fruits</hi> of Chriſts infinite Merits. For, infinite Merits cannot
benefit men altogether unqualified or uncapable of them. And Mercy
infinite muſt retaine the nature of mercy; it reacheth not beyond the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Object of mercy: And <hi>the proper Object of mercy, is penitencie or ſorrow
for Miſdemeanors paſt or preſent.</hi> Willfull continuance or obſtinacie in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant
courſes or contempt of mercy offered, is the Object of Juſtice or
indignation.</p>
                  <p>6. But beſides the <hi>Infinite Value,</hi> we are to acknowledge the infinite or
<hi>Everlaſting Efficacie,</hi> or <hi>Operative Vertue</hi> of this bloody Sacrifice of the Son
of God. Want of diſtinguiſhing between <hi>theſe two</hi> hath occaſioned many
Errours or overſights in Divinitie: That there is a <hi>Diſtinction</hi> to be put
betwixt them, we may thus conceive. Suppoſe the Son of God, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after he had payed the ranſom for our ſinnes, or in that Inſtant in
which he ſaid, <hi>Conſummatum Eſt,</hi> all is finiſhed, had depoſed or layed aſide
the humane nature, in which he was conceived and born to the end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
that he might dye in it (or according to it,) his offering or Sacrifice
<pb n="3295" facs="tcp:100044:165"/>
had been of Value infinite, in that it could purchaſe ſo <hi>Vniverſal a Pardon</hi>
at Gods hands for all ſinners, and for all ſinnes. Yet if he had laid aſide
the humane nature immediately after his ſuffering, <hi>The Everlaſting Efficacie</hi>
of this infinite Sacrifice had been cut off. Now beſides the infinite price of
our redemption which was then Payd when Chriſt ſaid <hi>Conſummatum Eſt,</hi>
another End of his aſſumption and retaining the humane nature, was,
that we might be partakers of <hi>the Everlaſting Vertue</hi> of his Sacrifice and
<hi>Prieſthood.</hi> And herein doth this Sacrifice truely differ from the ſacrifices
of the Law, from all ſacrifices whatſoever, in that we obtaine remiſſion of
ſinnes by it, and through it, not onely as it was once offered, but by the
<hi>reall Communication</hi> of its Vertue unto our ſoules. If there were any uſe
or need of a ſecond, third, or reiterated offering of it, the <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie</hi>
of it could not be imagined to be perpetually everlaſting or Unceſſant,
but endleſſe or unceſſant onely by Viciſſitude or Turn, in ſuch a ſenſe as
we ſay, <hi>the Moone ſhall be Eclipſed to the worlds end;</hi> Yet is it not eclipſed at all
times, but at ſome ſpeciall times, throughout all Ages of the world. But
if both the <hi>Value</hi> of the Sacrifice be truely infinite, and the <hi>Vertue</hi> of it
everlaſting without interruption or diſcontinuation, more Unceſſant than
the <hi>Motion</hi> of the heavens, or the <hi>Reſt</hi> of the earth: The often offering
of the Sacrifice, after what manner ſoever, is ſuperfluous and blaſphemous.
<q>The true reaſon then, why the Body of Chriſt is not, or ought not to be
often offered, is, not becauſe all our ſinnes were actually remitted by the
once offering of it, or remitted before they were committed: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
the ſubſtance or matter of the ſacrifice, is of the ſame force, at this
day, to remit ſinnes, that it was of, whileſt it was offered.</q> 
                     <hi>For his humane
nature was conſecrated by death and by his bloody Paſſion, to be a ſacrifice of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Vertue, to be the continual propitiation for our ſinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>7 If either the actual ſinnes of all men,<note place="margin">Chriſts Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, our baptiſm need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; if ſinnes be remitted before they be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</note> or the ſinnes of the <hi>Elect</hi> in
ſpeciall, had been ſo remitted by Chriſts death as ſome conceive they were,
that is, abſolutely pardoned before they were committed; there had been
no end or uſe of Chriſts Reſurrection in reſpect of us; no need of Baptiſm:
yet was Baptiſm, from the hour of his reſurrection, neceſſarie unto all that
did beleive in his death and reſurrection. The urgent and indiſpenſable
neceſſitie of Baptiſm, eſpecially in reſpect of actual beleivers, is not any
where more Emphatically intimated, than in <hi>St. Peters</hi> Anſwer to the <hi>Jewes,</hi>
Whoſe hearts were pierc't with ſorrow that they had been the cauſes of
Chriſts death. They, in this ſtound or ſting of Conſcience demand, <hi>Men
and brethren what ſhall we do? and Peter anſwered them, Repent and be Baptized
Every one of you, In the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, for the remiſſion of ſinnes. And
they that gladly received the word, were Baptized the ſame day. Acts</hi> 2. 37,
38, 41. Theſe men had been deeply tainted with ſin, not original onely,
but with ſinnes actual of the worſt kind: guiltie they were in a high degree
of the death of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> yet had they as well their actual as their
original ſinnes remitted by <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> It is then an unſound and imperfect
Doctrin, that ſin original onely is taken away or remitted by Baptiſm; for
whatſoever ſinnes are remitted or taken away by Chriſts death, the ſame ſins
are in the ſame manner remitted and taken away by Baptiſm into his death;
actual ſinnes are remitted in ſuch as are guiltie of actual ſinnes, when they
are baptized, though onely ſin Original be actually remitted in thoſe which
are not guiltie of actual ſinnes, as in Infants. No mans ſinnes are actually
remitted, before he be actually guilty of them.</p>
                  <p>8. The <hi>Queſtion</hi> is, how either ſin original is remitted, or how any
<pb n="3296" facs="tcp:100044:166"/>
work of Satan is diſſolved by Baptiſm, And this <hi>Queſtion</hi> in the General is
righly reſolved, by ſaying, <hi>They are remitted by faith.</hi> But this general <hi>Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lytion</hi>
ſufficeth not, unleſs we know the <hi>Object of our Faith</hi> in this particular.
Now the <hi>particular Object</hi> of our Faith, of that faith by which ſinnes (whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
by Baptiſm or otherwiſe) are remitted, is not our <hi>general Belief</hi> in Chriſt:
even our belief of Chriſt dying for us in particular, will not ſuffice, unleſſe it
include our Belief of the Everlaſting <hi>Vertue</hi> of his bloudie Sacrifice, and of
his everlaſting <hi>Prieſt-hood</hi> for purifying and cleanſing our ſoules. No ſinnes
be truly remitted unleſs they be remitted by the <hi>Office</hi> or exerciſe of his
<hi>Prieſt-hood;</hi> and whileſt ſo remitted they are not remitted by any other Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
then by the ſole <hi>vertue</hi> of his body and bloud, which he <hi>once offered for
all,</hi> for the ſinnes of all. It is not the Vertue or Efficacie of the conſecrated
water in which we were waſhed, but the <hi>vertue</hi> of his Bloud which was once
ſhed for us, and which by Baptiſm is ſprinkled upon us, or communicated
unto us, which immediately cleanſeth us from all our ſinnes. From this
everlaſting <hi>Vertue</hi> of this his bloudy Sacrifice, Faith, by the miniſterie of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm
is immediatly gotten in ſuch as had it not before. And in ſuch as have
Faith before they be baptized, the guilt of Actual ſinns is remitted by the
exerciſe or Act of Faith, as it apprehends the everlaſting <hi>Efficacy</hi> of this ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,
and by the prayer of faith, and ſupplication unto our High Prieſt. Faith
then is as the mouth or appetite by which were receive this food of Life, and
is a good ſign of health, but it is the food itſelf received, which muſt conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
health and ſtrengthen ſpiritual life in us; and the food of life is no other
then Chriſts Body and Bloud, and it is our <hi>High Prieſt</hi> himſelf, which muſt
give us this food.</p>
                  <p>Baptiſm, ſaith <hi>St. Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 3. 20. <hi>doth ſave us:</hi> what Baptiſm doth ſave us?
<hi>not the putting away the filth of the fleſh</hi> (yet this is the immediate effect of the
water in baptiſm) <hi>but the anſwer (or ſtipulation) of a good conſcience towards God.</hi>
But how doth this kind of Baptiſm, or this <hi>concomitant</hi> of Baptiſm, ſave us?
The Apoſtle in the ſame place tells us, <hi>by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> The
<hi>anſwer or ſtipulation of a good conſcience,</hi> includes an illumination of our ſpirits
by the <hi>Spirit of God;</hi> a qualification, by which we are made ſonnes of Light,
being before the ſonnes of darkneſs. But, That by this qualification we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the ſonnes of Light; That this qualification is by baptiſm wrought in
us; That by this qualification however wrought in us, we are ſaved from our
ſinnes; All this is immediately from the <hi>vertue of Chriſts Reſurrection.</hi> That
is, as you have heard before, he was conſecrated by the ſufferings of death
to be an everlaſting Prieſt, and by his reſurrection from death, his body and
bloud became an everlaſting Propitiation for ſinnes, an inexhauſtible Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
of Grace, by which we are purifyed from the dead works of
ſinne.</p>
                  <p>9. It is true again, that in the Sacrament of Chriſts Body and Bloud,
there is a propitiation for our ſinnes, becauſe <hi>He is really preſent</hi> in it, who is
the propitiation for our ſinnes. But it no way hence followes, that there is
any <hi>propitiatorie ſacrifice</hi> for ſin in this Sacrament. He becomes the propitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for our ſinnes, he actually remits our ſinnes, not directly and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
by the Elements of Bread and Wine, nor by any other kind of <hi>Local Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi>
or <hi>Compreſence</hi> with theſe Elements, than is in <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> The <hi>Orthodox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
Antients</hi> uſe the ſame Language, for expreſſing his <hi>Preſence</hi> in Baptiſm and
in the Euchariſt; they ſtick not to ſay, that Chriſt is <hi>preſent</hi> or <hi>Latent in
the water,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Elements of Bread and Wine.</hi> Their meaning is,
that neither of theſe Elements or ſenſible ſubſtances, can directly cleanſe
<pb n="3297" facs="tcp:100044:166"/>
us from our ſinnes by any vertue communicated unto them or inherent in
them, but only as they are pledges or aſſurances of <hi>Chriſts peculiar preſence</hi>
in them, and of our true inveſtiture in Chriſt by them. We are not then to
receive the Elements of bread and wine only in remembrance <hi>that Chriſt dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
for us,</hi> but in remembrance or aſſurance likewiſe <hi>that his body which was
once given for us, doth by its everlaſting Vertue preſerve our bodies and ſouls unto
everlaſting Life, and that his bloud, which was but once ſhed for us, doth ſtill cleanſe
us</hi> from all our ſinnes, from which in this life we are cleanſed, or can hope
to be cleanſed. If we then receive remiſſion of ſinnes or purification from
our ſinnes in the Sacrament of the Euchariſt (as we alwaies doe when
we receive it worthily;) we receive it not immediately by <hi>the ſole ſerious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
of his death,</hi> but by the <hi>preſent Efficacie or operation of his body,</hi> which
was given for us, and of his Bloud which was ſhed for us.</p>
                  <p>10. The reaſon why the bloud of Bulls and of Goats had no longer force
or efficacie to cleanſe men, though but from ſinnes againſt the Law of Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies,
then whileſt they were offered, was, becauſe their bloud was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible
bloud, and did periſh with the uſing. <hi>But we are not redeemed,</hi> ſaith S.
<hi>Peter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1. 18.</note> 
                     <hi>with corruptible things, as ſilver, and Gold, but with the pretious, bloud of
Chriſt, as of a Lamb without blemiſh or without ſpot.</hi> One part of the pretiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his bloud is, that it is farr more incorruptible then ſilver, gold, or
other pretious metall, and the leſs corruptible any metall is, the more
pretious it is; and the more pretious it is the more uncorruptible.</p>
                  <p>Though Chriſt then was truly mortal when he dyed for
us, yet the bloud that he ſhed forth for us at his death, did not become like
water ſpilt upon the ground, which cannot be gathered again; it did not
vaniſh or conſume as the bloud of Legal Sacrifices did; as his Body ſo his
Bloud was, not to ſee or feel corruption: not a drop of Bloud which was ſhed
for us, whether in the Garden or upon the Croſſe, but was the bloud of the
<hi>Son of God;</hi> but was ſhed by him, as willing at this price to become the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
High Prieſt of our ſoules: and not a drop of Bloud which was ſo ſhed
did ceaſe, or ſhall ever ceaſe, to be the bloud of the <hi>Son of God.</hi> His ſoule
and body we know were diſunited by death: yet were neither of them diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>united
from his Godhead or Divine Perſon. His Body whileſt laid in the
grave, was ſtill the Body of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> as ſtill retaining <hi>Perſonal Vnion</hi>
with his Godhead: So was his ſoule, ſo was his Bloud, the ſoule and Bloud
of the <hi>Son of God,</hi> as being indiſſolubly united to his Divine Perſon. Though
his bloud, whileſt it was ſhed or powred out, did loſe its Phyſical or Local
Union with his body, though one portion of it were divided from another,
yet no drop of it was divided from his infinite Perſon. And that which the
<hi>Romiſh Church</hi> would transferre unto each ſeveral crum of bread or drop of
Wine in the Euchariſt, is Originally and properly true of the ſeveral drops
or diviſibilities of Chriſts Bloud which was ſhed for us; whole Chriſt was in
every one of them, indiviſibly in every one of them God was, the Godhead
was and is perſonally united to all of them.</p>
                  <p>11. Whether all and every portion of his bloud which was then ſhed,
were, by the power of the Godhead, recollected and re-united to his Body,
as his Body was to his Soule at the reſurrection,<note place="margin">See Chap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 46. Numb 2.</note> we cannot tell; God knowes.
But this we know and believe, that the ſelf ſame bloud which was then ſhed,
whether it were gathered together again, or remained diſperſed, whether it
were re-united to his Glorifyed Body or divided from it, is ſtill united to the
Fountain of Life, to the Godhead in the Perſon of the Son. And being uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to this Fountain of Life (who dwelleth in it, as light within the body of
the Sun) it is of <hi>Efficacie everlaſting;</hi> it hath an immortal power or force to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
<pb n="3298" facs="tcp:100044:167"/>
the Works of Satan in us, as well thoſe which he worketh in us after
Baptiſm as before. The <hi>Vertue</hi> of it, to cleanſe and purge us from our ſinnes
(of what kind ſoever) is, at this day, as ſoveraign, as if it had been ſprinkled
upon our ſoules, whileſt it iſſued out of his body. It is impoſſible it ſhould
loſe its <hi>Vertue</hi> in or upon our ſoules, unleſs vve firſt loſe our Intereſt in it,
vvhich vve cannot loſe but by abandoning the vvaies of light, and polluting
our ſoules vvith the Works of darkneſs. For ſo long <hi>as we walk in the light,
the bloud of Jeſus Chriſt the Son of God, doth cleanſe us from all our ſins.</hi>

any <hi>Real Operation</hi> upon our ſoules, unleſſe they were ſo Locally preſent,

for their opinions, but moſt injuriouſly. For more then we have ſaid, or more
than <hi>Calvin</hi> doth ſtiffely maintain againſt <hi>Zuinglius</hi> and other <hi>Sacramentaries,</hi>
cannot be inferred from any ſpeeches of the truely <hi>Orthodoxal</hi> or <hi>Ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers;</hi>
They all agree, that we are immediately cleanſed and purifyed from
our ſinnes by the bloud of Chriſt; That his humane Nature by the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the <hi>Deitie</hi> is made to us the inexhauſtible Fountain of life. But about
the particular manner how life is derived to us from his humane Nature, as
whether it ſends its ſweet influence upon our ſoules only from the heavenly
Sanctuary wherein it dwells as in its Sphere; or vvhether his bloud vvhich
vvas ſhed for us, may have more immediate Local preſence vvith us, they no
way diſagree, becauſe, they, in this kind, abhorred curioſitie of diſpute. As for

in compariſon of Legal Sacrifices. The next Querie, is, How the everlaſting Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacie
of his Sacrifice, or of his Prieſthood was prefigured by Legal Sacrifices or puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
for ſin.</p>
                  <p>13. The Legal ſacrifices, as all agree, did generally foreſhaddow <hi>Chriſts
Onely</hi> and <hi>All-ſufficient Sacrifice.</hi> But in as much as they were corruptible
and their vertue tranſient, and by reaſon of their corruption and tranſient
vertue were often to be reiterated: they could not be ſo much as true ſhad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowes
either of his offering of Himſelf <hi>once for all,</hi> or of the <hi>everlaſting vertue</hi>
of his <hi>Onely Sacrifice once offered.</hi> Their imperfection, corruption, or tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
vertue, did ſerve as foyles to ſet forth the glorie and ſplendor of his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
Sacrifice, and moſt perfect offering. Of all the <hi>Legal Sacrifices</hi> which
preſent themſelves unto my former obſervation, or preſent memory, there
is one kind only which can beare the true ſhaddow or ſerve as a <hi>Modell</hi>
of the Everlaſting <hi>Efficacie</hi> of <hi>his onely Sacrifice</hi> once offered for all. And
that was the ſacrifice of the <hi>Red Heifer,</hi> Numb. 19. and the Legal
Uſe which GODS People under the Law were to make of Her
Aſhes.</p>

The correſpondencie between the effects of the <hi>Aſhes</hi> of this ſacrifice and
of the blood of Chriſt is gathered by our Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. ver. 13, 14.
<hi>If the Aſhes of an Heyfer, ſprinkling the unclean, ſanctif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>eth to the purification
of the fleſh: how much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal
ſpirit offered himſelf to God, purge your conſciences from dead workes to ſerve
the living God.</hi> But wherein did this ſacrifice picture out the <hi>Everlaſting
Efficacie</hi> of the Blood of the Son of God, in more peculiar manner than
other Legal ſacrifices did?</p>
                  <p>14. <hi>Firſt,</hi> in that all ſuch as were legally unclean by touching a Corps
or Grave, by comming into a Tent wherein a Corps lay unburied, or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
the veſſels in ſuch a Tent to be uncovered, were to be purified by
the <hi>Water of Sprinkling</hi> which was qualified or conſecrated to this purpoſe
by the Aſhes of the <hi>Red Cow or Heyfer:</hi> and as often to be purified by this
water as they ſhould incurre this Legal uncleanneſs. And yet the ſacrifice
of this beaſt was not to be offered ſo often as this people did incurre theſe
Kinds of legal uncleanneſs. Thus much is Evident from the practice of
the Jewiſh Church during the time of the Law.</p>
                  <p>For this water of purification was often every year, oft-times Every month
to be ſprinkled upon ſome one or other of this people, oft-times upon one
and the ſame man within one and the ſame year, even as often as he ſhould
by chance, or negligence incurre any of the former branches of uncleanneſſe.
Yet was not this ſacrifice, whoſe aſhes were ſtill to be mingled with the water
of purification, to be offered once Every year, in every Age, or in many
Ages. The Sacrifice of the <hi>Red Heyfer,</hi> as the <hi>Jewes</hi> confeſſe, was but nine
times offered during the time of the Law; <hi>Once</hi> by <hi>Eleazar Aarons Son</hi> in
the wilderneſs. And this ſacrifice was not reiterated untill the deſtruction
of <hi>Salomons</hi> Temple, that is, not during the ſpace of a thouſand yeares
and more. It was the <hi>Second Time</hi> offered by <hi>Ezra</hi> after this peoples Return
from Captivitie, and but ſeven times after, unto the deſtruction of the
ſecond Temple. And this <hi>Fooliſh Nation</hi> ſince that time hath not preſumed
to offer it, but expects the offering of it the tenth time by their <hi>King Meſſias<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi>
Thus is the faithleſs Synagogue, by Gods providence, the Keeper, not of the
Sacred Oracles onely written by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the prophets, but even of thoſe
<hi>Traditions</hi> which teſtifie the ſumme and truth of theſe Oracles, to wit, <hi>that
this legal ſacrifice, amongſt the reſt, was to be accompliſhed in their Meſſias:</hi> He
was indeed to ſet the Period to this legal Rite, and to all the reſt, not by of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
them after a Legal Rite or manner, but <hi>by offering up himſelf</hi> inſtead
of them all, <hi>once for all,</hi> in bloodie ſacrifice, in whoſe <hi>infinite Value</hi> and
<hi>Everlaſting Efficacie</hi> all other ſacrifices or offerings for ſin, were ſo termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
or ſwallowed up, as Land-rivers or currents of waters are in the ſea.
But what circumſtance have we from the written Text, that this ſacrifice
was not to be ſo often offered, as this people had occaſion to uſe the water
of ſprinkling or the Aſhes of this ſacrifice to cleanſe them from their former
Legal pollutions?<note place="margin">Numb. 19.</note> It is ſaid ver. 9. that <hi>the Aſhes ſhould be laid up without
the Camp in a cleane place, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, &amp; reſerved or kept for the congregation of
the children of Iſrael for the water of ſeparation.</hi> The Aſhes were <hi>to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,</hi>
not for this Generation onely preſent, but for the uſe of Poſteritie.
As Manna, which was commanded in the ſame Character <hi>to be reſerved</hi>
in the Ark, was the Type of Chriſt as he is the food of life, or the bread
which came down from heaven; So were theſe Aſhes as an Emblem of
the <hi>Everlaſting Efficacie</hi> or operative vertue of his ſacrifice. There is no
Bodily ſubſtance under heaven, which can be ſo true an Emblem or model
<pb n="3300" facs="tcp:100044:168"/>
of incorruption as Aſhes are. Being the Remainder of bodies perfectly
diſſolved or corrupted, they are not capable of a ſecond corruption. And
when it is ſaid, <hi>that the Aſhes ſhould be reſerved for a water of ſeparation,</hi> the
meaning is, that one ſacrifice might afford aſhes enough to ſeaſon or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie
as many ſeveral veſſels of water, as this people for many generations
ſhould have occaſion to uſe for Legal purification. So it is ſaid in the ſame
ninth verſe, that the Reſervation of theſe Aſhes <hi>was a Purification for ſin.</hi>
A purification, not in <hi>Act onely,</hi> or for one or two turnes, but a <hi>Continual Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification:</hi>
or as a <hi>Treaſurie</hi> or ſtorehouſe for making as many purifications
or waters of ſprinkling as this people had occaſion to uſe. And ſo Chriſt
is ſaid <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 3. to have made a <hi>purification for our ſinnes; when he had by
himſelf purged our ſinnes</hi> (ſaith our Engliſh) <hi>he ſate down on the right hand
of the Majeſtie on high.</hi> But the <hi>Tranſlation</hi> (under Correction) comes
ſomewhat ſhort of the <hi>Original,</hi> and the ſhorter it comes of it, the more
advantage it yeilds unto their opinion which think their ſinnes were remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
and purged before they were actually committed. The Apoſtles words
are, <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, haveing made a <hi>Purification</hi> for ſin, he hath aſcended
into heaven. The word <hi>Purification</hi> is not to be reſtrained to <hi>One Act</hi> or
operation, but includes or implies the <hi>Perpetual qualitie</hi> of himſelf or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of his ſacrifice being by this one Act conſecrated to be a perpetual
Fountain of purification. As he did not onely make one propitiation for our ſinnes;
So neither did he once actually purge us from our ſinnes by offering up
himſelf, but ſtill remaines the purification of our ſinnes: that is, he doth
ſtill purifie and cleanſe us from our ſinnes, as often as we ſeek by Faith and
true repentance to be cleanſed and purified by him.</p>
                  <p>15. So then the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Legal Sacrifice or <hi>Heyfer</hi> did conſecrate the
<hi>Aſhes</hi> to be as a <hi>Storehouſe</hi> or treaſury of legal purification, and the Aſhes thus
conſecrated by this ſacrifice, did hallow or conſecrate the <hi>Water</hi> which was
put into them to make actual purification as often as occaſion required.
So did our <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> by <hi>the One Sacrifice of Himſelf,</hi> conſecrate his <hi>Blood</hi>
to be an inexhauſtible Fountain of purification Evangelical. And his <hi>Blood</hi>
and <hi>Body</hi> thus conſecrated once for all, do conſecrate or ſanctifie the <hi>Water
of Baptiſm</hi> to cleanſe or waſh Infants from ſin Original; and ſuch as are of
yeares when they are baptized from ſinnes Actual againſt the moral Law of
God. So doth his <hi>Blood</hi> or operative <hi>Vertue</hi> of his Everlaſting ſacrifice,
conſecrate or qualifie the Elements of Bread and Wine to purifie and cleanſe
our ſoules from ſuch actual ſinnes, as after Baptiſm we have committed.
This <hi>perennal Efficacie</hi> or <hi>Operative Vertue</hi> of Chriſts Body and Blood,
conſecrated once for all by the ſacrifice of himſelf, to be a perpetual puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
for ſuch as were to be conſecrated Kings and Prieſts unto their God,
which was thus pictured by the former Legal or <hi>Moſaical Rites,</hi> was more
expreſsly foretold by the Prophet <hi>Zacharie.</hi> For having in the twelfth
Chap. ver. 10. Propheſied of the <hi>piercing of the Son of Gods moſt pretious
Body by the Jewes,</hi> (for which when God ſhould open their eyes to ſee the
truth, they ſhould lament and mourn) he explicates the Uſe or End to
which the Divine Providence had deſtinated this their malitious crueltie
Chap. 13. 1. <hi>In that day there ſhall be a Fountain opened to the houſe of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,
and to the inhabitants of Jeruſalem, for ſin and for uncleanneſs.</hi> By this
offering of himſelf <hi>Once for all,</hi> by this opening of his <hi>pretious Side,</hi> he hath
conſecrated all that are <hi>Sanctified,</hi> and all that are ſanctified are ſanctified
by it: Yet not actually ſanctified or actually conſecrated by his Blood
<pb n="3301" facs="tcp:100044:168"/>
before it be ſprinkled in our hearts by Faith. And to inſtruct us that the

was conſecrated to be an <hi>Everlaſting Prieſt.</hi> And if he be an <hi>Everlaſting Prieſt</hi>
he ſtill executes the Office or <hi>Function</hi> of an High Prieſt. And it is our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie,
the <hi>Chief Point</hi> of our Religion, to ſupplicate unto him as to <hi>The Onely

Sacrifice, as we ſay, <hi>ex Officio,</hi> by exerciſing the Office or Function of an <hi>High
Prieſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Queſtion is, <hi>Wherein the Function or exerciſe of his Prieſthood doth
conſiſt.</hi> To this we anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> Negatively, That it doth not conſiſt in
the often offering up of himſelf by his Prieſts or Miniſters here on Earth;
For if he were on Earth, ſaith the Apoſtle, Heb. 8. 4. <hi>he ſhould not be a Prieſt.</hi>
This argues, that he exerciſeth his <hi>Prieſt-hood</hi> in the heavenly Sanctuary, not
in Temples made vvith hands. So ſaith the Apoſtle more expreſly, Heb. 9.
24. <hi>Chriſt is not entred into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures
of the true, but into heaven it ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us. Nor
yet that he ſhould offer himſelf often, as the High prieſt entreth into the holy place every
year, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, with bloud of others. For then muſt he often have ſuffered
ſince the foundation of the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The truth then is,</hi> as you have heard before, that Chriſt by his bloudy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice
upon the Croſſe, was conſecrated to be an <hi>Everlaſting Prieſt.</hi> And
that this Conſecration was not accompliſhed untill his Reſurrection from the
dead. For it is not conceivable that he ſhould be an <hi>Everlaſting Prieſt</hi> before
he became an <hi>Immortal man,</hi> and by his riſing, &amp;c, opened the Gate of Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
life. After he was thus conſecrated by death, and by the reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
from the dead, to be an <hi>Everlaſting Prieſt after the Order of Melchizedeck,</hi>
he was not to offer any ſacrifice: nor do we read that <hi>Melchizedeck</hi> offered

                  <p>2. <hi>This exerciſe of Christs ſpiritual Prieſthood</hi> in the heavenly Sanctuary, was
foreſhaddowed by ſundry ſervices and ſacrifices of the Law, By that Solemn
<hi>Attonement</hi> which the <hi>High Prieſt</hi> made in the <hi>moſt holy place:</hi> and, as we have
often ſaid, by the ſacrifice of the <hi>Red Heifer</hi> alſo; Albeit that ſolemnitie
did prefigure him likewiſe in the <hi>Act of his Conſecration,</hi> or deſignation to his
heavenly Sanctuary. This <hi>Heifer</hi> was ſlain by another without the Camp,
in <hi>Eleazars</hi> ſight, and yet <hi>Eleazar</hi> the Prieſt was to ſprinkle the bloud of this
ſacrifice <hi>before the Tabernacle of the Congregation,</hi> that is, <hi>with his face towards
the Sanctuary,</hi> on which unleſs he did conſtantly look, whileſt he did ſprinkle
the bloud, the ſervice was fruſtrated, as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſay. This teſtifyed that
the <hi>validity of this Act</hi> or the purification intended by it, was to be expected
<hi>from the Sanctuary;</hi> Chriſt likewiſe was ſlain by the hands of ſinful men
without the City.<note place="margin">Heb. 9. 14.</note> And yet though ſlain by them, <hi>he offered himſelf by the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Spirit.</hi> And whether by <hi>This eternal ſpirit,</hi> or by his ſpirit (as man) or
by both; certain it is, that by the <hi>Spirit,</hi> he ſprinkleth the bloud of the
<hi>new Covenant</hi> upon us, and prepareth a way for us to the heavenly Sanctuary.
As the people under the Law might not enter into the Congregation, nor
the <hi>Prieſts into the Sanctuary</hi> untill they had been purifyed from their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs
by the water of ſprinkling: ſo neither could we or any of Gods
people have acceſſe unto the <hi>moſt holy Place</hi> or heavenly Sanctuary untill the
way were prepared for us, by the bloud <hi>of the Son of God,</hi> nor untill we be
ſprinkled and purifyed with his Bloud. <hi>Having therefore brethren boldneſſe
to enter into the holyeſt by the bloud of Jeſus, by a new and living way, which he hath
conſecrated for us, through the vaile, that is to ſay, his fleſh. And having an high
Prieſt, over the houſe of God, Let us draw neer with a true heart in full aſſurance
of faith, having our hearts ſprinkled from an evill conſcience, and our bodies wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed
with pure water,</hi> Heb. 10. 19, 20, 21, 22. He conſecrated <hi>the Way</hi> it ſelf, by
his <hi>Bloudy ſacrifice</hi> upon the Croſs: from the very moment in which the Vail
did rend aſunder, the door was opened and <hi>the Way</hi> prepared. But we muſt
be qualifyed for walking <hi>in this way,</hi> and for entring into this heavenly <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary,</hi>
by the preſent exerciſe of <hi>his everlaſting Priesthood,</hi> which is a <hi>Prieſthood
of bleſſing,</hi> not of <hi>ſacrifice.</hi> And yet he <hi>bleſſeth</hi> us by communicating the
<hi>vertue</hi> and efficacie of his Everlaſting Sacrifice unto our ſoules.</p>
                  <p>This participation, and this <hi>Bleſsing</hi> by it, the full expiation of our ſinnes,
we are to expect from his heavenly Sanctuary.</p>

doth our hope apprehend within the vail? The Apoſtle tells us <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 20.
<hi>Even Jeſus made an high prieſt after the order of Melchiſedek;</hi> that is, an high
prieſt <hi>to bleſſe us in the Name of the Moſt High God,</hi> to make us bleſſed, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
bleſſed as the Sonnes of God, or ſuch as he himſelf, as man, is, that

                  <p>4. Yet ſeeing he entred not into the heavenly Sanctuary without blood,
ſeeing he purified Even Heaven it ſelf by his Blood; We may not expect
the <hi>Bleſſing</hi> promiſed unto <hi>Abraham</hi> otherwiſe than by the <hi>Vertue</hi> of his
Blood, nor may we expect that his Blood or <hi>Vertue</hi> of it ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated

from his heavenly Sanctuary, and ſay unto every one whome we Baptize,
as he did unto the Leper, <hi>I will, be thou clean;</hi> our waſhing is but in vain,
our whole Action is but a Ceremonie. We his Prieſts or miniſters may
upon <hi>Confeſſion</hi> made unto us either in <hi>General</hi> or in <hi>Particular, Abſolve</hi> his
people from their ſinnes; for this Authoritie he hath given us <hi>[whoſe ſinnes

He by his ſpirit, or ſweet influence of Grace, ſay unto the ſoule, whom
we <hi>Abſolve,</hi> as he ſome-times did unto the man ſick of the Palſy, <hi>Be of

although without our <hi>Abſolution</hi> he do not in this ſort <hi>Abſolve</hi> his people of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes
from their ſinnes. We may <hi>Conſecrate the Elements</hi> ofBread &amp; Wine,
and adminiſter them ſo conſecrated, as <hi>Vndoubted Pledges</hi> of his Bodie and
Blood, by which the <hi>new Covenant</hi> was ſealed, and the <hi>General Pardon</hi>
purchaſed: Yet unleſs he grant ſome <hi>actual Influence of his ſpirit,</hi> and
ſuffer ſuch <hi>Vertue</hi> to goe out from his <hi>Humane Nature</hi> now placed in his
Sanctuarie, as he once did unto the woman that was cured of her Iſſue of
<pb n="3304" facs="tcp:100044:170"/>
blood; unleſs this <hi>Vertue</hi> do as immediately reach our Soules as it did her
bodie, we do not <hi>Really</hi> receive his Body and Blood with the Elements of
Bread and Wine. We do not ſo receive them as to have our ſinnes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
or diſſolved by them: we do not by receiving them become <hi>of his
fleſh and of his Bones.</hi> We gain no degree of <hi>Real Vnion</hi> with him, which is
the Sole Uſe or fruit of his <hi>Real Preſence.</hi> Chriſt might be <hi>Locally Preſent</hi>
as he was with many here on earth, and yet not <hi>Really Preſent.</hi> But with
whomſoever he is <hi>Vertually Preſent,</hi> that is, to whomſoever he communicates
the Influence of his Bodie and Blood by his ſpirit, he is <hi>Really Preſent</hi> with
them, though <hi>Locally Abſent</hi> from them. Thus he was <hi>really preſent</hi> with
the woman, which was cured of her bloodie iſſue, by touching the hemme
of his garment. But not ſo <hi>really preſent</hi> with the multitude that did throng
and preſs upon him, that were locally more preſent with him. She did
not deſire ſo much as to touch his <hi>Bodie</hi> with her hand, for ſhe ſaid in her
ſelf, <hi>If I may but touch the Hemme of his garmennt I ſhall be whole.</hi> And yet
by our Saviours interpretation, <hi>She did touch him more immediately than they
which were neerer unto him,</hi> which thruſt or thronged him. And the reaſon
why ſhe alone did more immediately touch him than any of the reſt, was,
becauſe <hi>Vertue</hi> of healing did goe out from him to her alone. It is true
then (for our Saviour ſaith it) <hi>her Faith did make her whole,</hi> and yet ſhe was
made <hi>whole by the Vertue which went out from him;</hi> this was the fruit or effect
of her Faith, or rather the Reward or Conſequent of her Faith. In like
ſort, as many as are healed from their ſinnes, whether by the Sacrament
of Baptiſm or the Euchariſt, are healed <hi>by Faith relatively</hi> or inſtrumentally.
Faith is as the mouth or organ, by which we receive the medicine: but it
is the <hi>Vertual influence</hi> derived from the Body and Blood of Chriſt which
properly or efficiently doth cure out ſoules and diſſolve the works of Satan
in us.</p>
                  <p>This woman, as <hi>St. Matthew</hi> relates the ſtorie, had ſaid within her ſelf,
<hi>if I may but touch the hemme of his garment I ſhall be whole:</hi> She wanted either
the opportunitie or boldneſs to touch the fore-part of his garment, or to
come into his ſight or preſence. Yet he then knew, not onely, that ſhe had
touched the Hemme of his garment, but what ſhe had ſaid within herſelf,
and out of his knowledge of this her faith and humilitie, he did pronounce
and make her whole. Now it is but one and the ſame <hi>Act</hi> of one and the
ſame Divine Wiſdom, to know the hearts and ſecret thoughts of men a
farre off and neere at hand. And therefore a matter as eaſie, for <hi>the Son of
God,</hi> or for <hi>the man Chriſt Jeſus in whom the Godhead dwelleth bodily,</hi> though
ſtill remayning at the right hand of God, to know the hearts and ſecret
thoughts of all ſuch as preſent themſelves <hi>at his Table</hi> here on earth, aſwell
as he knew the ſecret thoughts of this woman which came behind him. What
need then is there of his <hi>Bodily Preſence</hi> in the Sacrament, or of any other
preſence than the influence or emiſſion of vertue from his heavenly Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary
unto our ſoules? He hath left us the conſecrated Elements of bread and
wine, to be unto us more than the hemme of his garment. If we do but
touch and taſt them with the ſame faith by which this woman touched
the hemme of his garment, this our faith ſhall make us whole, and ſtanch the
running iſſues (and cleanſe or cure the leprous ſores) of our ſoules, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
as it did this womans iſſue of blood.</p>
                  <p>But of <hi>Chriſt's Preſence</hi> with us (Eſpecially in the B. Sacrament of
his Body and Blood) we ſhall take occaſion to ſpeake ſomewhat more, in
Handling the <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>His Sitting at the Right-Hand of God,</hi> which may
<pb facs="tcp:100044:170"/>
perhaps give the Reader ſome degree of Satisfaction, and Line out
the <hi>Right Mean</hi> betwixt <hi>Conſubſtantiation</hi> and <hi>Tranſubſtantiation;</hi> or
