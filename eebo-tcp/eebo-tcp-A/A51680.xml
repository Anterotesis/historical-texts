         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHen the fears and jealouſies of ſome concerning
us are ſo reſtleſſe, the malice of others is ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable,
that we ſuffer not only for what we
have done, but for what we may do, and we are not only
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:98617:3"/>
obnoxious to Authority for thoſe miſcarriages the world
hath ſeen us guilty of, but unto the Tongues and pens of
men; for thoſe likewiſe the world may imagine us guilty
of: To juſtifie his Majeſties clemency over us, to give the
world a reaſon of the hope that is in us, to ſatisfie all ſober
men, and to to promote tee peace and ſettlement of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Country, we declare.</p>
            <p>1. That it is true indeed, we cannot come up in all
things to their judgement who are over us, as we know they
could not come up to ours, when we were advanced over
them; and as we could not allow them any publick em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment
or encouragement when they could not comply
with us, and our Laws and Conſtitutions, ſo we cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
any publick employment or encouragement from
them, now we diſſent from, and cannot cloſe with their
Laws and Conſtitutions: Yet it is true, that we <hi>ſubmit
patiently</hi> to that Authority which we cannot <hi>obey chearfully;</hi>
really we cannot conform in <hi>conſcience,</hi> and really we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reſiſt in <hi>conſcience;</hi> for we muſt needs <hi>be obedient, not only
for wrath, but for conſcience ſake:</hi> we ſuffer, yet we repine
not; we murmur not, we <hi>ſpeak no evil of Dignities;</hi> we
dare <hi>not curſe the King, no not in our thoughts:</hi> we deſire to
<hi>fear God,</hi> we deſire to <hi>honour the King;</hi> and we would not
meddle with them that are given to change, or to Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
they of us pay tribute from whom tribute is due, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome
from whom cuſtome, and fear from whom fear; and
his Majeſty hath our hearty prayers day and night before
the Throne of Grace for a bleſſing upon himſelf and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
and if we could renounce the whole Covenant,
yet would we not renounce that part of it, wherein we have
<hi>promiſed, ſincerely, really, conſtantly, in our ſeveral vocations, to
endeavour, with our Eſtates and Lives, to preſerve and defend
the Kings Majeſties Perſon and Authority, that the world may
bear witneſſe with our Conſciences of our Loyalty, and that we
have no thoughts or intention to diminiſh his Majeſties juſt power
and greatneſſe:</hi> for indeed we (whatever the world may
think of us) deſire to honour his Majeſty: 1. For the
Lords ſake, by whom Kings reign, who by a ſpecial provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:98617:3"/>
hath ſet our gracious King over us. 2. For our own
ſakes, who though we are not capable of preferment under
his Majeſty, yet owe unto him our lives, which he hath par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned,
our liberties and eſtates, which he ſecures to us, and
the protection he affords us: It is a mercy that we may live
comfortably as Chriſtians, though we cannot be employed
and preferred as Miniſters.</p>
            <p>2. It is true we have different apprehenſions in many
things from other men, and in many things we are other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
minded; but we are reſolved, in thoſe things, to which
we have already attained, to walk by the ſame Rule, to
mind the ſame things, and if we cannot be of one mind, we
deſire to be of one heart; and to preſerve unity of affections
in our differ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ces of judgement.</p>
            <p>We deſire heartily, that the ſmall things we differ in
ſhould not have ſo much power to divide us, as the great
things we agree in ſhould have to unite; however we beg
of the Lord heartily, that we may live peaceably with all
men; we deſire earneſtly to ſeek truth and peace, and to
follow peace and holineſſe, without which, we think, we
cannot ſee the Lord: we deſire to be juſt in our dealing,
harmleſſe and innocent in our behaviour and carriage, and
to have our converſation honeſt in the world, that whereas
ſome ſpeak againſt us as evil doers, they may by our good
works, which they ſhall behold, glorifie God in the day of
viſitation; and though we are ſorry to hear it, that ſome
think it ſtrange that we run not with them to the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
of Ryot, ſpeaking evil of us, yet will we ſit ſtill, knowing
that they ſhall give an account unto him who <hi>judgeth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous
judgement.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>3. Without all dangerous, offenſive, or ſuſpitious deſigns
or complottings, which we abhor, have, we fince the twenty
four of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> held up our private Devotions in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles
Doctrine, and fellowſhip, and breaking bread from
houſe to houſe, and in prayers, loving as brethren; at theſe
our Meetings we plot nothing but the ſaving of ſouls, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting
the weak, reclaiming the erroneous, inſtructing the
ignorant, building poor ſouls up in their faith, as helpers of
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98617:4"/>
their joy, for the perfecting of the Saints, the work of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry,
the edifying of the body of Chriſt, and helping our
brethren in the publick miniſtry, who ſince our withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
have a great burden lying upon them; ſome may
preach Chriſt out of envy, ſome out of diſcontent, but
Chriſt is preached, and we dare boldly ſay, nothing but
Chriſt crucified is preached among us: wherefore we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce,
and we hope they rejoyce too, ever ſince we hope
without offence we have preached the Word, and have been
inſtant in ſeaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and out of ſeaſon, reproving, rebuking,
and exhorting with all long-ſuffering and doctrine: here
have we no thoughts of our King and Countrey, but
thoughts of peace; no words of either, but ſerious Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
to obedience under the one, and ear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſt prayers for
the peace and proſperity of the other: we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſire indeed to
converſe profitably, to improve our time and opportunities
uſefully, to provoke one another to love and to good works.
In obedience to his Majeſties Laws for peace and order, we
have no factious Conventicles; in compliance with his
Majeſties good inclination, for ſerious holineſſe, for ſober
friendſhip we converſe with one another lovingly, we meet
at one anothers habitations friendly and neighbourly, we
open our doubts one to another ſincerely, and endeavour to
reſolve one another ſatisfactorily; we pray unanimouſly,
one reads, another openeth what is read, and preſſeth home
what is ſo opened; and ſo with prayers, and a hymn, and
a little refreſhment we diſmiſſe one another, and take our
leave<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Prophets ſpeak, two or three, and the others
judge; if any thing be revealed unto another that ſitteth
by, the firſt holdeth his peace, for we all prophecy one by
one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted; but we
muſt needs ſay, whatever in ſuggeſted to the contrary, that
among us the ſpirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the
Prophets; for we own, that God is not the Author of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,
but of peace, as in all the Churches of the Saints:
we hope there is ſo much of the Engliſh genius of Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and good nature abroad in the world, that none will
cenſure us, either for familiar meetings, which are neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourly,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98617:4"/>
or for making good uſe of thoſe meetings which
is Chriſtian: Indeed we were unſufferable, if we ſet up pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
meetings in oppoſition to publick Aſſemblies; but its
a common obſervation by this time, that we never go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
privately the ſame hour that others meet publickly;
and indeed we are glad when they ſay unto us, <hi>Let us go up
to the Houſe of God.</hi> One thing we have deſired of the Lord,
that while we ſeek after, that we may dwell in the Houſe of
the Lord all the daies of our lives, to behold the beauty of
the Lord, and to enquire in his Temple. And its ſeldome
that we eſcape any opportunities of joyning with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
Aſſemblies, for though we cannot adminiſter in the
Church, yet we cannot ſeparate from the Church: we
would not partake with the Churches ſins, leaſt we be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led;
we would not remove from the Church, leaſt we be
nothing: And indeed we deſire only in private to ſet home
upon our hearts what we have gained in publick; we would
ſecond the Miniſters at home, whom we cannot aſſiſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad:
Its true, they of us that fear the Lord, ſpeak often
one to another, but we dare not ſpeak any thing that is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs,
for we know the Lord hearkeneth and heareth us,
and a Book of Remembrance is written before, for them
that fear the Lord, and think upon his Name.</p>
            <p>4. Foraſmuch as there is no well-affected Chriſtian that
is not deeply ſenſible of the unſetledneſs, diviſion, animoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
prophaneneſs, decay of Trade, and other calamities,
whereby our Native Country is expoſed to the pity of
Neighbours, and the ſcorn and inſultation of Enemies; we
do effectually endeavour to work our hearts to a ſound hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation
for our own ſins, which have contributed too
much to the common calamities, ſeeing we are ſo unhappy
as to add to the meaſure of publick provocations, we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
but be ſo compaſſionate, as to endeavour to add to the
meaſure of publick prayers, humiliations and interceſſions.</p>
            <p>5. To prevail with God the more effectually, we zeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
ſtir up our Neighbours and Friends to be paſſionately
affected with the preſent Eſtate of the Churches and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of Chriſt, that as they helped on their miſeries by their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98617:5"/>
ſins, ſo they may aſſiſt in their recovery, by their tears, ſighs
and prayers.</p>
            <p>6. We endeavour by all means to gain juſt notice, and a
true account of the eſtate of our Native Country; that as
the men of <hi>Iſſachar,</hi> we may be men underſtanding the
times, and knowing what <hi>Iſrael</hi> ought to do; and herein
we obſerve: Firſt, our ſins we allow, to the great diſhonor
of the Majeſty of the holy God we ſerve, and the purity
of the holy Goſpel we profeſs: And ſecondly, the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
we lye under, by reaſon of theſe ſins; our great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
is to root up the greateſt evil, that is Sin, and draw
neer the higheſt good, that is God, that he would take de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
in us to do us good, and would receive us graciouſly,
and love us freely.</p>
            <p>7. We deeply lay to heart, and ſecretly mourn for the
ſins of the people, repreſenting them to our thoughts in
their heynous nature and circumſtances, humbly entreating
the Lord for their ſerious repentance of them, and earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deprecating the judgements provoked by them; ſo that
we lay together both the evils we feel, and thoſe we have
too juſt cauſe to fear, and in a due ſenſe of both, we deſire
to humble our ſelves, and others, under the mighty hand of
God.</p>
            <p>8. And therefore whenſoever we have an opportunity to
ſpeak from God to his people in the publick Aſſemblies,
we deſire to ſpeak a preſent truth, and to lay open and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail
the ſins of the time, and to awake the people with all
zealous exhortation to a lively and juſt ſorrow for all
the overflowings of wickedneſs, and to a vehement and
godly ſtriving againſt the ſtream thereof by their prayers and
utmoſt endeavours, day and night conſtantly pouring out
their hearts in ſtrong cryes and ſervent prayer to our God,
that he will be pleaſed to viſit us in mercy and compaſſion,
and cauſe the light of his countenance to ſhine upon us.</p>
            <p>9. And however, privately we ſet apart one day at leaſt
in every week for this holy end and purpoſe, wherein we
humble our ſelves in private faſting and prayer, till it pleaſe
our God to return to his in his wonted pity and compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98617:5"/>
and put an end to our ſins and miſeries, recovering us
to that firſt ſtate of Innocence, peace and plenty, which we
were happy in before our late miſcarriages.</p>
            <p>10. We do reſtrain our wonted pleaſure, not allowing the
liberty of that mirth and lawful refreſhment which we
might formerly make uſe of, while the hand of God lieth
thus heavily upon us.</p>
            <p>11. We do not allow our ſelves the neglect of any good
means of prayer, reading, meditation and conference,
whereby the peace and welfare of this Church and State
may be procured and maintained, and ſhall carefully avoid
all words and actions, ways and means, which may at all
tend to the widening of the unhappy breaches, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing
the many and woful differences among us, <hi>ſeeking
peace,</hi> and <hi>enſuing it,</hi> ſtudying now in our leiſure time, to
look into the bottom of Controverſies, that we may bring
differences to as narrow a compaſs as we can, beget a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
good underſtanding and ſatisfaction among ſober
men, clearing up things as far as lieth in our power for the
reuniting of all honeſt and faithful hearts in a firm concord
of Chriſtian love, endeavouring to diſcover and defeat
all the devices and machinations of Satan, and his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gines,
againſt the peace and welfare of the Church in all
parts of the world, eſpecially in theſe wherein we are
intereſted.</p>
            <p>12. And particularly <hi>conſidering our ſelves,</hi> our own miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages
and infirmities, we ſhall not as afore fly out upon
the weakneſs, defects, or exceſſes of our Fathers or Brethren,
aggravating the blame of thoſe their actions or Opinions,
which may be capable of a gentler or milder conſtruction,
reſolving to look as charitably upon all their proceedings,
who are otherwiſe minded in matters of an inferiour Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
bending our whole endeavours againſt known ſin, and
open prophaneſs, the great Enemies of our peace and ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:
As we have preached, ſo we deſire to live, that chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
that ſuffereth long, and is kind, is not eaſily provoked,
thinketh no evil, beareth all things, believeth all things,
hopeth all things, endureth all things.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:98617:6"/>
13. And to that purpoſe we have firſt of all laid aſide all
our leſſer Opinions among our ſelves, and our little ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and diviſions, and reſolvedly knit our ſelves together
in an entire affection one to another, that by this all men
may know <hi>that we are Chriſts Diſciples, becauſe we love one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother,</hi>
and are ready to ſhew all mutual reſpects of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an
love, and obſervance to each other upon all occaſion
loving as Brethren: As likewiſe we ſhall in all meekneſs of
ſpirit lovingly converſe with, and kindly, affectionate to,
and reſpectful towards all our Fathers and Brethren in
their places, living without offence, and blameleſs.</p>
            <p>14. We mourn, but not <hi>as men without hope;</hi> that our
gracious God will find out a way to have mercy upon us,
and to chear up his countenance towards all his Choſen
Ones, wiping (as that holy Biſhop ſaid) <hi>all tears from their
eyes, and all ſpots from their faces,</hi> and anſwering the holy
deſires of their hearts, in ſhewing them <hi>Sion</hi> in perfect beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
and that not by overturning any part of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
but by opening our hearts to ſee our errours, and
cloſe one with another, by turning the heart of <hi>the Father
towards the Child, and of the Child towards the Father, leaſt God
come and ſmite the earth with dicurſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>15. In the mean time we poſſeſs our Souls in patience,
and we keep ſilence before God, waiting upon him that hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth
his face from <hi>Jacob;</hi> for his Spirit of love, unity, peace
and concord, reſolving to continue thus doing, till we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
an anſwer from heaven.</p>
            <p>16. Its true, there are many of us whoſe bodies will not
bear that auſterity of faſting and humiliation which our
cauſe may require, yet they that cannot faſt do pray, and
they that cannot ſpare a day in ſeven, can ſpare an hour in
twelve, and make up the reſt in frequent and ſervent ejacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</p>
            <p>17. Whereas ſome have pretended that we ſet up a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
within a Government, and that we have an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
among our ſelves, we muſt let the world know we
are all equal, and we have no formality or Ceremony a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
us, but a free and voluntary entrance, left open for
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98617:6"/>
all comers into this ſtrict courſe of Chriſtian Auſterity,
without any noyſe, without the required notice of any,
but God and their own conſcience, that all may well know
and ſee, that here is no deſign than meerly Spiritual, aim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at nothing but Religious Tranſactions, between God
and our own Souls, and conſiſting in the performance of
the unqueſtionable exerciſes of Piety and holy Devotion.</p>
            <p>18. Since we have been uncapable of ſpeaking to the
people the things that are of everlaſting concernment, we
have recommended to them the writings of good men, pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
and peaceable, who being <hi>dead yet ſpeak,</hi> and poor men
we know may read a good book, when they cannot hear a
good man; and we our ſelves teach them from houſe to
houſe, with tears day and night, as the Apoſtles did, leaving
with them ſuch books as Mr. <hi>Baxters Call,</hi> his <hi>Now or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,</hi>
his <hi>Directions for Peace of Conſcience,</hi> his <hi>Saints Everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Reſt,</hi> Mr <hi>Bolton,</hi> Dr. <hi>Sibbs,</hi> Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> and
Dr. <hi>Preſton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>19. We ſettle mens judgements upon moſt firm and ſolid
principles, leading to peace and holineſs, leading them
through that ſafe and middle way that is equally diſtant
from all the extremes men have run into in their hearts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
ſome points of Religion, as particularly in the
points now in difference among us, we teach our people,
that though we cannot conform to the Church without ſin,
yet they cannot ſeparate from it without ſin; we cannot
adminiſter according to the preſcribed form, but we and
they can hear according to it; we muſt joyn with the
Church in our duties, though we are not guilty of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities;
we teach them that it is one thing to hold com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion
with a Church that is under ſome miſcarriages, and
another thing to act thoſe miſcarriages; what we chiefly
inſiſt on, are things much comporting and agreeing with
the ſpirit of the Scriptures, and things that are moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to build men up in their moſt holy Faith, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the power of godlineſs in their hearts and lives.</p>
            <p>20. Its true, we deſire to ſettle our peoples hearts upon
all occaſions, but always offering them ſuch things as tend
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:98617:7"/>
to peace and quietneſs, and godlineſs of living, dealing
as faithfully with them, as thoſe who muſt give an account;
and if therefore we have any intereſt with them, we improve
for God our Soveraign, and the Church of Chriſt, for
whoſe diſtreſſed members we ſometimes ſolicit them with
ſucceſs, and find them willing above their ſtrength and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
and we hope the Lord will not forget their work and
labour of love, and yet we deſire not to wrong any Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
in his place, for indeed we ſtated the point of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
maintenance upon ſuch grounds, that we are perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
no ſober Chriſtian, with whom we have any intereſt,
will withdraw any thing that is due from any man that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours
in the Word and Doctrine, and watches for their
Souls: And though we are otherwiſe repreſented, yet our
great endeavour is, by a diſcreet interpoſition to allay and
fix the people to a due temperament (gently guiding ſome
mens well-meaning zeal by ſuch rules of moderation, as are
beſt to reſtore and preſerve the health and peace of this
Church and Kingdome, much pleaſing our ſelves in that
good and firm underſtanding which would thence grow
between his moſt Excellent Majeſty and his good people,
all jealouſies being laid aſide, our own and our Poſterities
Intereſt lay before us many ſtrong obligations to ſeek and
preſerve the peace and welfare of the Land of our Nativity;
the offence which ſome mens dangerous medling and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſie
interpoſitions have contracted upon our profeſſion, we
have reſolved to expiate by ſuch moderations for the future,
as might not only check the exceſſes of our practiſe, but of
our Opinions too, no men having a greater kindneſs for
peace and ſettlement preſerved in truth, unity and order,
then our ſelves, whom it moſt concerns, whether we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our conſciences; callings or intereſts, as knowing, that
nothing undermines to much in our Authority and Call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as thoſe dangerous diſſentions wherein the people learn
to ſhake off both.</p>
            <p>21. It is true, we cannot own that Epiſcopacy now eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
ſo as to undertake it our ſelves, yet we would ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to it as to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98617:7"/>
whether to the King as Supreme, or to thoſe <hi>who are ſent
by him,</hi> whoſe great charges and care is like enough to
betray them to ſome errours, and many enemies, whereof
they canno but contract good ſtore, while ſo eminent and
ſo active, they provoke that envy which improved to a po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
<hi>odium,</hi> is able to overcaſt the higheſt Merit and Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity;
wherefore the Biſhops have our prayers, pity, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance;
and although we cannot in our judgement ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
all that they do, driven it may be rather by the<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
of the people and unhappineſs of this age, then <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
their own diſpoſition to any height and rigour of action;
yet we allow not that their perſons or Government ſhould
be expoſed to the malapartneſs of the looſe and irreverent
multitude, who take a bold liberty to deſpiſe <hi>Dominions,</hi>
and to ſpeak evil of <hi>Dignities,</hi> whereas we have always
taught, that men ſhould cheerfully ſubmit to the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
when they cannot in <hi>Conſcience</hi> allow all the practiſes of
thoſe that are over them in the Lord: Indeed, we never
met with a more perplexed conjuncture of affairs, then the
late buſineſs of Biſhops, when between our unſatisfiedneſs
in <hi>Conſcience</hi> under that <hi>Government,</hi> and the woful neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
if we ſhaked off that of being under none, we run head,
long to that which we thought then expedient, rather then
we ſhould ſuffer ſome <hi>inconvenience</hi> under that which, well
regulated we muſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> always approve as juſt, preferring the
humour of ſome particular men, before the reaſon of the
Chriſtian World: Well experience hath taught us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that
we had better live where nothing is lawful, then where all
things are ſo; that Anarchy is the greateſt oppreſſion, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs
the greateſt grievance and an unbounded liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
the greateſt ſlavery<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>22. Indeed we allow it for weaker Chriſtians, who
have not their hearts enlarged with an ability to expreſs
their own wants and deſires, both lawful and convenient
to help themſelves in prayer, the uſe of a preſcribed form,
wherein they may have their own caſe and condition more
pithily and affectionately then they are able to expreſs it
themſelves, and if the uſe of ſuch a form do prove a means
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98617:8"/>
to warm the affections, and enkindle their grace, we
looking not upon it as any quenching of the Spirit, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
not in our apprehenſion eſſential to the nature of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
that it be either read, or rehearſed by memory, or by
immediate ſuggeſtion, but rather that it be delivered out
of the book, or out of the heart, with <hi>underſtanding</hi> and
ſuitable affections, with humility and confidence, and an
inward ſenſe of our <hi>condition;</hi> nor is there any great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
betwixt repeating by memory, and reading out of a
book, the memory being but a kind of inviſible book for
the regiſter of our thoughts, though in this caſe it ſhould
be eſpecially remembred, that in the uſe of ſuch preſcript
forms, to which a man hath been accuſtomed, he ought to
be narrowly watchful over his own heart, for fear of that
lip-ſervice and formality which in ſuch caſes we are more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially
expoſed unto; but yet for any one ſo to fit and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie
himſelf with his Prayer-book, as to go no further,
this were ſtill to remain in his <hi>Infancy,</hi> and never grow in
grace or gifts; and withall, its very hard for a man to find a
preſcribed form that may ſuit with our ſeveral emergencies;
and therefore indeed we do not tye our ſelves ſo preciſely
to any particular form of words, though of our own
compoſing, and fitted to our <hi>condition,</hi> but that we may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
add or alter, according as our emergent occaſion, or
ſome new affection ſuggeſted ſhall require: Sometimes we
feel our hearts more warm, our deſires more vigorous, and
our expreſſions more copious and ready: And in this caſe
we ſuffer not our ſelves to be ſtreightened or confined to any
form, but take our liberty to expatiate more freely, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
as we find our inward: in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>argements.</p>
            <p>23. Amongſt all the ſtratagems of Satan, whereby he
would undermine Religion, and pervert the ſouls of men,
though there cannot be any more unreaſonable, yet there
was never any more unhappily ſucceſsful then the raiſing
and cheriſhing fears and jealouſies in the world, that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
in the height and exaltation of it, is an Enemy to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;
and that to be a through-paced, a ſincere and
zealous Chriſtian, is to be dangerous to the State: We
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98617:8"/>
therefore, as Miniſters of this Religion, are bold in the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
&amp; truth of the Goſpel, to ſay that (whatever the men
of the world judge of us) we profeſs Chriſtian Religion
in ſo harmleſs and innocent a way, that we have ſtudied
and endeavoured to ſtate the Rights of <hi>Civil Government</hi>
upon the cleareſt and firmeſt principles, to ſecure them by
the moſt powerful obligation, and to urge them upon men
by the moſt efficacious motives of rewards and puniſhments
in the world: And we profeſs ſincerely, that we look upon
our late miſcarriages as moſt unhappy ſcandals to our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
and thoſe ingaged in them ſo for us, to perſiſt ſtill
as Enemies to the Croſs of Chriſt, and men born to bring
our holy Chriſtian profeſſion into jealouſie, ſuſpition, and
diſgrace with the powers of the earth, and to ſtir up the
Kings of the earth to ſtand up, and the Rulers to take coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel
together againſt the Lord, and againſt his Chriſt, that
they ſhould break their bonds in ſunder, and caſt their cords
from them: We are ſo ſenſible of the original and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Government, of the end and uſe of it, in reſpect of
good and evil men, and thereof the neceſſity of ſubjection
for <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſake, and of the ſin and danger of reſiſting
an <hi>Ordinance</hi> of God, conſidering that they who reſiſt pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately
or openly by word or deed, reſiſt to their own dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
that we cannot allow any perſon upon any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
whatſoever, in any manner whatſoever, to vilifie, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe,
murmure againſt, diſparage, undermine, or oppoſe
lawful Authority that is ſet over him, we ſay upon any
pretence whatſoever, either 1. In reſpect of the perſon go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning,
as Errour, Hereſie, Idolatry, harſh Adminiſtration,
or the like, in which caſes the ſervants of God in all Ages
had no other remedy but patience, and prayer, and crying
mightily to the Lord, 1 <hi>Sam</hi> 8. 9, 11, 12, 18. as they did
under <hi>Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> thoſe Monſters
of mankind. Or 2. In reſpect of the perſons governed, be
they never ſo holy ſeeing, beſt of men, yea God and Man in
this caſe obeyed unto the death. 3. In reſpect of any cauſes
whatſoever, though it be Religion, whereof we conceive
the Magiſtrate ought to have the greateſt care, ſo that we
are perſwaded in our <hi>Conſciences,</hi> that to them who have
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:98617:9"/>
imbraced Chriſtianity in the true and genuine ſpirit of it, as
we hope we have all done; and to thoſe who without vile
affections, and carnal intereſts, ſhall apply themſelves to
know the mind of God delivered in Scripture: As we hope
we do with peaceable ſubmiſſion, and patience is a clear duty
under any Government; ſo that though the Spirit of the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler
be ſtirred againſt them, yet they cannot ſtir out of their
place.</p>
            <p>24. And as we are thus juſtly affected to Soveraignty, as
knowing by whom the powers are ordained, as we dare not
curſe the King in our heart, or revile the Ruler of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
much leſſe ſlander the footſteps of Gods Anointed; as
we ſubmit for conſcience ſake to every Ordinance of God;
yea to every Ordinance of man for the Lords ſake, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
to diſobey in regard of the Oath of God; and pay
cuſtome where cuſtome, and tribute where tribute. So in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
whatever apprehenſions men have of us abroad in the
world, we deſire to fill up every relation conſcionably and
faithfully according to the Rule, and as men that deſire to
approve our ſelves to God and men; as 1. to our calling, we
deſire to be faithful, neither ſuppreſſing nor corrupting the
truth, to take heed to our ſelves, and to all the flock of God,
over which the holy Ghoſt hath made us overſeers, to feed
the Church of God which he hath purchaſed with his own
blood: We deſire to ſpeak from the heart to the heart, to
feel in our ſelves what we ſpeak, to others; that we may
ſerve God with our ſpirit in the Goſpel of his Son, that we
may ſave our ſelves and thoſe that hear us; that we may
walk from love to God, to the glory of God, and the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of our ſouls, as able, faithful, reſolute, induſtrious, in
preparing <hi>for,</hi> and exerciſing of our Miniſtry, and as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate
of ſouls, preaching the Word purely, plainly, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tly,
powerfully and ſincerely, adminiſtring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
carefully, inſtructing our Flocks, adviſing, admoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and comforting them as we ſee occaſion; being good
examples to Believers, in words in converſation, in charity,
in ſpirit, in faith, in purity and waiting upon God for ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs:
We deſire to be neither too auſtere in our retiredneſs,
nor too cheap in our ſociableneſſe, but carrying ſo even a
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98617:9"/>
hand, that our diſcreet affableneſs may be free from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and that we may win our people with a loving con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation;
as ſecondly to our Relation, firſt to our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,
we deſire to be the mouth of our people to God by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
prayers, and the mouth of God to our people by whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome
Inſtructions, and holy Admonitions, loving, tender,
and careful of our neareſt Relations, devoting them to
Gods ſervice, and committing them to his care, providing
yet for them honeſt things in the ſight of men, and going
before them in good examples of piety and holy converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and ſo over-looking them, as they that have more then
meer bodies committed to our charge: We deſire to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar,
meek, humble, and courteous towards all, and
helpful one way or other to our neighbour, as they that
think our ſelves born to do good, maintaining peace and
love at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>25. We think we have fully informed our ſelves in all the
neceſſary points of Religion; and we are ſo firmly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in thoſe fundamental and ſaving truths, that we will not
be carried about with every wind of doctrine; as for cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
we neither neglect them, nor yet too eagerly
purſue after them; we receive nothing in Religion upon
truſt: nor dare we abſolutely follow any guide, but ſuch as
we are ſure cannot erre; we have ſome hours for ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
but our Life is to reduce knowledge to practice, and ſo
much we think we know, as we can live; where we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
we we can ſubmit, where we muſt diſſent we can be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent,
and where we diſſent from the Church, we deſire to
examine throughly whether we are deceived; we keep cloſe
to thoſe truths which do moſt promote the glory and grace
of God, the reformation of men, and the ſalvation of ſouls:
<hi>Whoſoever therefore by pride, or faction, or ſchiſme, or ambition,
or novel fancies, and arrogance, or ignorance, or ſedition, or
popularity, or vain-glory, or envy or diſcontent, or corroſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
or any other carnal reaſon ſhall cauſe diviſions or offences
by teaching any other doctrine then what we have received, we
look not upon him as the Servant of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>26. We deſire we may not be judged for our auſtere
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98617:10"/>
converſation and ſtrict life; for we deſire, ſo to ſpeak, and
ſo to do, as they that ſhall be judged by the Law of Liberty:
We would our diſcourſe were grave, diſcreet, pertinent,
free from vanity, free from offence: We allow our ſelves no
corrupt or unſavoury communication; in worldly affairs
we deſire nothing may fall from us but what is ſeaſonable
and well adviſed; in ſpiritual, ſuch as may miniſter grace
to the hearers, and ſuch as is ſparing and charitable, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
neither detraction nor cenſure; not meddling with any
matters of State<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but keeping our ſelves within compaſſe,
only deſiring to underſtand the times, that we might know
what <hi>Iſrael</hi> ought to do: In word and actions we deſire to
walk circumſpectly, to avoid all appearance of evil; to
walk as in ſincerity, as in truth, and as in the ſight of God;
exerciſing our ſelves to a good Conſcience, void of offence
towards God and towards men; willing in all things to
live honeſtly, and endeavouring to live without rebuke in
the middeſt of a crooked and perverſe generation; and if
we are more earneſt and ſerious then ordinarily, you muſt
know, that we are ſenſible <hi>how ſhort time is, what eternity is,</hi>
and <hi>what are our immortal ſouls,</hi> and <hi>what that God is with
whom we have to do.</hi> Our recreation we deſire may be ſafe,
inoffenſive and moderate in time and meaſure, ſuch as may
refreſh a tired body and mind, and not effeminate or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch
them, we would indeed rejoyce, as if we rejoyced not.
We allow our ſelves ſo far creature-enjoyments, as nature
requires, and grace moderates, and our God bleſſeth: we
redeem our time, conſidering it is not our own improving it
to our beſt advantage; we know a day or a night well
ſpent, makes way for Eternity. We deſire to be very obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant
of our outward converſation, but we look chiefly at
our inward frame; we live by the precepts, we live upon the
promiſes, we affect not ſingularity, we aim at ſincerity, our
Habits commend us not to God, yet by our Habits we
would not give offence unto men; our devotion we deſire
may be with fear and reverence on the one hand, and with
Faith and ſincerity on the other, we watch unto prayer,
and we watch after prayer; and indeed we deſire always
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98617:10"/>
to watch and be ſober, fearing in adverſity, and rejoycing in
tribulation, knowing that tribulation provoketh patience,
and patience experience, and experience hope, and hope
maketh not aſhamed.</p>
            <p>27. Our indeavours to keep a good underſtanding at
Court by our Friends and Brethren, is loaded by our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
(for ſo ſome would be ſtill, notwithſtanding his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties
endeavours for pacification) with all the obloquies
and exaſperations imaginable, and looked upon by ſome
indifferent men with jealouſies and fears; but theſe men
know not the juſt motives and pregnant grounds with
which we think our ſelves furniſhed for thoſe undertakings,
God knows it is not any intereſt or party we deſire to ſerve
there, but we purſue the peace and good of the Kingdome,
and endeavour to prevent future dangers, which we may
foreſee will in all likelihood follow ſome mens activity (if
not reſtrained) by a moderate Intereſt; not as if we would
ſtop the courſe of Law, or weaken Authority, but that we
deſire heartily, as many honourable Perſons do, with his
Majeſty and his Father of bleſſed memory, <hi>That no Party or
Intereſt be exaſperated</hi> (and the multitude are eaſier exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperated
then appeaſed) <hi>by croſsneſſe, and aſperity of ſome mens
paſſions, humours or private opinions, grounded only upon diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences
in leſſer matters, which are but the skirts and ſubburbs of
Religion; wherein</hi> (as his late Majeſty of renowned Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
obſerved, as an Angel of God) <hi>a charitable counivance
and Chriſtian toleration of ſin diſſipates their ſtrength, whom
rougher oppoſition fortifieth, and puts the deſpiſed and oppreſſed
party into ſuch combinations as may moſt enable them, yet a full
revenge on thoſe they count their perſecutors, who are commonly
aſſiſted with that vulgar commiſeration, which attends all that are
ſaid to ſuffer under the notion of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Indeed we only deſire (what that famous Prince wiſhed)
viz.</hi> That ſolid piety, and thoſe fundamental truths (which
mend both hearts and lives of men) be kept up and encouraged
with equal justice and impartial favour; and that the outward
circumſtances and formalities of Religion devour not all, or the
beſt encouragement, of learning, induſtry and piety, but that with
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98617:11"/>
an equall eye and impartial hand favours and rewards he diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
among all men, as they are found, for their real goodneſſe,
both in ability and fidelity worthy and capable of them: This,
<hi>ſaith that excellent Prince,</hi> will be ſure to gain the hearts of
the moſt, and the beſt too, who though they be not good them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
yet are glad to ſee the ſeverer wayes of virtue at any
time ſweetned by temporal rewards.</p>
            <p>And though it be ſuggeſted, that we are not to be truſted
about his Majeſty, although we can make it appear, that
ſince his Majeſty was reſtored we have paſſed three years
with ſo much innocence, and ſo little compliance with any
Intereſt or Faction, that not one publick action we did ſince,
but is capable of a fair and equitable plea; yet ſince an Act
of Indempnity and Religion is paſſed, we think it our duty
ſo for to comply with his Majeſties Intention in granting
that Act, as not to mention any thing, how defenſible ſoever,
which he hath commanded ſhould be utterly forgotten, but
to give our preſent ſence of things, we can ſincerely profeſſe,
that we have not only a Loyal, but a moſt affectionate
eſteem for his Majeſties Perſon and Government; for ſince,
beſides the general obligation of Subjects, we are bound by
our Religion to prize gratitude above all things; we could
not be juſt, ſhould we not moſt earneſtly deſire the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
of that Prince, unto whoſe ſingle endeavours we owe
all our Liberty; for we all acknowledge, that his Majeſties
perſonal and paſſionate interpoſings did confirm our <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempnity,</hi>
and his moſt pious and unequalled <hi>Declarations</hi>
have ſatisfactorily evidenced, that he is not unwilling to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
the utmoſt extent of ſober and Chriſtian Liberty,
which, as we have elſewhere profeſſed, are expreſſions of ſo
much goodneſs in the midſt of ſo great power, and after <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many
provocations,</hi> that he hath not the heart of a man, much
leſſe of a Chriſtian, that hath not a due ſence of them; we
are ſure they have ſo throughly poſſeſſed us, that if in any
publick action of ours there be any Inſtance that can be
wreſted to the diſparagement of his Majeſties Royal Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Government: we intreat the world to take notice,
that we do hereby utterly diſown it, as being directly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary
to our profeſſed Principles, which lead us to no one
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98617:11"/>
point of outward practice more ſtrictly and powerfully then
an exact and punctual obedience to his Majeſties Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,
and a chearful ſubmiſſion to his Authority. And
once for all, now it hath pleaſed his Majeſty to enjoyn an
outward conformity, to which we cannot in all things
ſubſcribe, we are reſolved, the Lord aſſiſting us, to ſubmit
with chearfulneſſe, and to ſuffer with ſilence, for as there is
an active diſobedience, which is to reſiſt, ſo there is a paſſive
diſobedience, that is, to repine, neither of which can we by
any means approve of; ſince whatever we cannot conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enciouſly
do, we think our ſelves obliged to ſuffer for, with
as much joy, and with as little reſiſtance, as if any other act
of obedience were called for from us. We may perhaps be
too partial to our ſelves; but certainly in general we may
pronounce, that whoever is of this temper, whatever his
judgement be, as touching things indifferent in their own
nature, yet he cannot be ſuppoſed incompatible with wayes
of publick ſafety. And over and above all, we are not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable
of being dangerous to this Government, but by our
Repreſentatives in Parliament, who are now men of ſuch
unſpotted integrity towards his Majeſties Perſon and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
that it is a wonder if malice it ſelf can find the
leaſt ſuſpition of danger.</p>
            <p>28. It is true (as ſome ſay) that by our diligence,
good husbandry, and the bleſſing of God upon our endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
we have got among us a conſiderable part of the
treaſure of this Land; for we are a people that improve our
time, and follow our buſineſſe, as whoſe ſtrict profeſſion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids
us thoſe exceſſes which ſwallow up other mens time
and eſtates; Hounds, Hawks, Games, Wine, Women, Playes,
and other vanities, have neither our thoughts nor our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,
which we reſerve for higher advantage, which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
watch, and as conſtantly meet with (ſo great an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
hath the ſober againſt the intemperate) yet out of
what we have, are we ready upon all occaſions to aſſiſt his
Majeſty, and ſupport his Government; yea if, as ſome would
have, it ſhould pleaſe his Majeſty to impoſe upon us a Levy
for our former miſcarriages, his Indulgence to us, and for
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:98617:12"/>
the peace and tranquillity we enjoy under him, it ſhould be
parted with as chearfully as ever we parted with money in
the heat of the late trouble; neither would we ſo anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
look upon what is gone of our eſtate, as we would
thankfully take notice of what remains. It is true, we have
got eſtates ſome of us in the late troubles, and now we have
places about the King, and indeed we know not how to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate
former tranſgreſſion againſt his late Majeſty, but by
endeavouring to be as capable as we can to ſerve his Son:
Among our many failings we hoped this would have been
none, that we uſed all means to get into his Majeſties ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
no place eſcaping us that could be had for love or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney;
as we have done amiſſe, not out of malice, but miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
or miſapprehenſion of things, ſo we hope none
ſhall be more loyal and faithful then we, who, ſenſible of our
errours and our injuries, do feel in our own ſouls moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement
motives to repentance, and earneſt deſires to make
ſome repairations for former defects.</p>
            <p>For his Majeſties and his Fathers faithful Souldiers and
Subjects, who out of conſcience ſunk in the ſame ruine with
their Liege, Lord and Soveraign, we declare, upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
when we are called to it, that we think it neceſſary for
publick ſettlement, that they ſhould be provided for as may
be juſt and expedient; ſuch valour and gallantry we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe
they have ſhewed, that we heartily wiſh we may never
want ſuch men to ſerve our Soveraign, to maintain his Laws
and Kingdomes in ſuch a peace, as wherein they may enjoy
their ſhare and proportion as much as any men; and ſo
wiſh withall, that we did cloſe ſo unanimouſly in one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſubjection, that there were no note of diſtinction left,
and no quarrel remain but this one, <hi>viz. who ſhould be moſt
Loyal and faithful:</hi> we would have our fellow Subjects live
as ſtrictly and as warily as we do, and they will ſee, the very
money that is ſpent upon their vanities would procure them
places as well as ours does us: and as for ſuch of them as
the iniquity of the times, or their own faults have made
poor, our very exceſſes would ſupport them, and what we
throw away idly would relieve them: we are ready to joyn
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98617:12"/>
in any expedient that may accommodate all grievances,
that if it be poſſible we may have no more complaining in
our ſtreets. In a word, thoſe that are well inclined on all
ſides are ready to agree, but that there are ſome crafty and
ſubtle men on both ſides, that would keep our diſtances and
animoſities to ſerve their private ends, which they propoſe
ſometimes to themſelves out of the publick ruine, aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
all things with the moſt odious circumſtances, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to inflame the vulgar to a temper uncapable of
reſtraint or Government, that now we are at ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
we look upon it as no leſſe a providence, that God
keeps the people within the bound of Law, and the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
of Authority, then that he keeps the Sea within its
channel, and the waters within their banks. And thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
ſince our ſecluſion have we endeavoured to approve
our ſelves Gods faithful Children and Servants by honour
and diſhonour, by evil report and good report, as deceivers,
and yet true.</p>
            <p>29. The great diſcourſe of the Nation at this time is their
Taxations, from which ſome would perſwade the world
we under our preſent diſcontent make ſome advantage, in
reference to which our ſenſe hath been always this: 1. That
all our payments are our advantage, we allow his Majeſty
a part of our Eſtate, to ſecure the whole; we ſupport his
<hi>Government,</hi> he protects our lives and eſtates from that rage
and rapine which in a few daies may deſtroy the induſtry of
many years; we teach men conſtantly not to be ſo imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent,
as to complain of any common charge or burthen
which ſeems neceſſary to the preſent policy, under which
we may have leave to live peaceable and quiet lives, in all
godlineſs and honeſty; no ſafety to us without the reſtraint
of other mens luſt and violence, and no reſtraint, without
a <hi>Government</hi> that is able to raiſe a conſtant guard to every
man that would live ſecurely under his own Vine, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
his own Fig-tree.</p>
            <p>We know that there are four pillars of Government and
Order. 1. Religion, that ſetleth the heart of men. 2. Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice,
that ordereth their lives. 3. Counſel, that may apply
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98617:13"/>
the Rules of Juſtice and Religion to particular occaſions.
4. Treaſure, which laſt is ſo neceſſary, that without it, Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers
will be corrupted, Counſels betrayed, Armies ill paid
and diſciplined, Trade obſtructed, and a poor Nation will
lye open to the dangerous attempts of an untoward people
at home, and the unneighbourly encroachments of potent
Princes abroad. 2. All payments are of our own impoſing,
by our conſent in Parliament. 3. Our late miſcarriages oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
our preſent grievances. 4. Yet we are not now under
the eighth part of former payments: We tell our people,
that our King affords us Chriſtian protection, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
we may very well allow him dutiful aſſiſtance, by our
lives, eſtates and prayers.</p>
            <p>30. Here we thought to have concluded, but that there
remains two particulars more, whereof we think fit to
give an account, and then we ſhall ſet a period to this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity.</p>
            <p>The firſt is this; <hi>viz.</hi> Why we have been ſo importunate,
both a little before the 24 of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> and ever ſince, againſt
Popery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Its true, that we had verily thought Popery had
rendred it ſelf juſtly odious, by its own abominations in
doctrine, worſhip, and bloudy ſlaughters, and that in theſe
daies of light and knowledge, to imagine a poſſibility of
its return upon the Proteſtant Churches, (which yet hath
been the <hi>Opinion</hi> of divers eminent for Learning and Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
among us) was groundleſs fear, where no fear was:
yet really conſidering: 1. The vaſt numbers of Popiſh E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſaries,
Prieſts and Jeſuites that ſwarm among us, Engliſh
Colledges, as we are certified, being much emptied by the
reaſon of multitudes ſent hither, whoſe ways are ſubtil
and cloſe, whoſe induſtry is indefatigable, whoſe influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
and efficacy upon all ſorts of perſons is powerful,
whoſe ſupport from abroad is paſt finding out. 2. The
printing and vending ſo many Engliſh Popiſh books, which
conſidering the Apoſtaſie of ſome, the indifference of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
diſtracted by our unhappy diviſions, cannot ſpeak
leſs then a great inclination to a revolt to Popery. 3. The
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98617:13"/>
toleration of Popery publickly by them pleaded for. 4. The
Jeſuites deſigns and models of reducing <hi>England</hi> to <hi>Romes</hi>
obedience, followed and promoted by many deluded Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants.
5. The union of forreign Popiſh power, which
how ſoon the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> (being ever vigilant to improve
ſuch occaſions for the propagation of its own greatneſs)
may make uſe of, for the extirpation of the Proteſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
we need not divine. 6. The whole body of Popery
publiſhed by Sectaries, eſpecially <hi>Quakers;</hi> upon theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
we were awakened, <hi>to contend earneſtly for the
faith once delivered to the Saints;</hi> having not the leaſt thought
of any dangerous intimations to the people, as if our Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours
or Government (both which we think in our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences
clear in that matter) had any inclinations for, or
were to give any countenance to that Myſtery of Iniquity:
And it was therefore that we recommend to our beloved
Congregations: 1. The love of the truth in ſincerity. 2. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
endeavours to heal the ſad breaches and diviſions
which are among us. 3. To read good books. 4. To make
<hi>Conſcience</hi> of all Family duties. 5. To attend on publick
Ordinances. 6. To be well grounded in the principles of
Religion, and to watch over their hearts.</p>
            <p>2. It was given out, that we the diſſembling Party had
made an accommodation among our ſelves, the naked truth
whereof is this; indeed we have endeavoured to follow the
things that make for peace, which we have reduced to
theſe heads following.</p>
            <p>1. Peace with God; if our ways pleaſe the Lord, our E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies
will be at peace with us.</p>
            <p>1. Of Nature in one common grace, wrought in us
by one Spirit; if we had all one new Nature, we ſhould
have all one mind.</p>
            <p>2. Of Judgement; 1. In principles of Doctrine which
we draw up; which are 1. Few. 2. Plain. 3. Weighty.
4. Clear. 5. Subſervient to godlineſs. 6. Univerſally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed.</p>
            <p>2. Principles of obedience of Worſhip, of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
contained in the ten Commandments, the Lords
Prayer, the Belief, and the Scripture.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:98617:14"/>
3. Of affections; one heart where there cannot be
one mind, kindly affectionate one to another, loving as
Brethren.</p>
            <p>4. Of ends; they that agree in the end, will in time
agree in the means.</p>
            <p>2. Unity; and that Scripture.</p>
            <p>3. Uniformity; that every thing be done according to
Scripture, decency and order, that we be one of one way,
and of one mind, and walk by the ſame Rule.</p>
            <p>4. Order; none ſtirring out of his place, all ſtudying
to be quiet, and to follow their own buſineſs peaceably and
obediently, knowing them that rule over them.</p>
            <p>5. The power of Grace and Religion, which is a wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome
from above; firſt pure, then peaceable, and the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of Religion makes for peace. 1. By ſubduing luſts,
whence come worſe. 2. By working that love that beareth
all things, &amp;c. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 3. By enlightening the mind, dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
come from ignorance, if we have grace to practiſe
what we know, God will reveal other things in due time,
and we ſhall all agree. 4. By ſubduing that covetouſneſs,
ambition, pride, envy, &amp;c. that diſturb the world. 5. The
power of Grace in us will convince all men, that God is in
us of a truth, and ſo will pacifie the world.</p>
            <p>The 6th thing that makes for peace, a great care of weak
and wilful ignorance, which is lazy, and will not ſearch for
truth; baſhful, and is aſhamed to do it; ſullen, and will
not underſtand.</p>
            <p>7. Take care of intereſt private or publick; keep up a
frame of ſpirit that looks rather what is juſt, neceſſary and
true, then what is expedient and uſeful.</p>
            <p>8. Be humble and teachable, neither proud nor ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceited
pertinacy, nor think ſeriouſly on this obvious
truth, a man may erre: put on meekneſs and long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>9. Take care of reſpect of perſons, and of prejudice.</p>
            <p>10. Be deliberate and ſober, proving all things.</p>
            <p>11. Have a zeal always guided by knowledge.</p>
            <p>12. Let nothing be done through ſtrife, or vain-glory.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:98617:14"/>
13. Prudently ſuſpend your judgement and practiſe, and
if you have faith, have it to thy ſelf.</p>
            <p>14. All lawful condiſcention and forbearance one with
another, forbearing and receiving one another, and bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one anothers burden.</p>
            <p>15. Wait by prayer on the God of peace, for your
ſelves, for your Miniſters, for your Magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>16. Mark them that cauſe diviſions, and avoid them.</p>
            <p>17. Give up your ſelves to your faithful Miniſters, whoſe
faith follow, conſidering the end of their converſation.</p>
            <p>18. Be wiſe unto ſobriety, and rather believe then di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute,
avoiding all unneceſſary queſtions.</p>
            <p>19. Take care of an Innovating Spirit, ſtand in the
way, ask which is the good way, and walk therein, and
you will find reſt for your Souls.</p>
            <p>20. Conſider one another, ſo as to provoke one another
to love, and to good works.</p>
            <p>21. Let the ſpirits of the Prophets be ſubject to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets.</p>
            <p>22. Correct and keep down the riſing of our knowledge
with humility in our ſelves, and charity towards others.</p>
            <p>23. So long as there is ſound agreement in fundamental
truths, and in the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, ſilence all di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes,
in matters meerly notional and curious, which have
no neceſſary influence into faith and godly living.</p>
            <p>24. Let there be a joynt obedience to the truths wherein
all agree, and purſuance of the end which all profeſs, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto
we have already attained; let us walk by the ſame
Rule, let us mind the ſame things, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 26.</p>
            <p>25. Out of a ſerious and ſingle-hearted love of truth,
let us addreſs our ſelves to the ſearch of holy Scriptures.</p>
            <p>26. A mutual and brotherly love, which is a very great
means to work upon the judgements of one another, and
to take off all impediments as uſually ariſe from perſonal
prejudice in diſquiſition of truth.</p>
            <p>27. Keep your ſelves to the Analogy of faith, the form
of ſound words:</p>
            <p>28. Labour againſt the inward grounds of contention, as
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:98617:15"/>
pride, ſelf-love, envy, malice and covetouſneſs, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
after a meek, charitable, yielding, and ſubmiſſive
diſpoſition of heart and frame of ſpirit, that may let fall
private intereſt for the publick.</p>
            <p>29. Meet and converſe together for a mutual good, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
of one another.</p>
            <p>30. Wait upon God for further illumination in all
truth.</p>
            <p>31. Let the grounds of Religion be laid by Catechiſing.</p>
            <p>32. Suppreſs the beginning of religious debates, by a
fair and amicable communication among your ſelves.</p>
            <p>Thus we have given a ſincere account of our ſelves, which
we beſeech the Lord to bleſs, to confirm the weak, to direct
the doubtful, to convince gain-ſayers, and to gain peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
and ſober men favour with God and men.</p>

            <p>FOraſmuch as there is no well-affected Chriſtian, that
is not deeply ſenſible of the woful calamity of this
once glorious Church, now humbled into the duſt of
confuſion, and expoſed to the pity of all thoſe forreign
Neighbours, which heretofore bleſſed it as a ſingular pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern
of Divine Mercy; and to the ſcorn and inſultation of
<hi>Gath</hi> and <hi>Aſcalen:</hi> And for as much as it is, and hath
been ever the practice of the Enemies of our peace, to range

Devotion, ſtriving with ſervent Prayers and Tears to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
from Heaven a ſeaſonable redrefſe of theſe our preſſing
Calamities, and a prevention of that utter overthrow and
final Devaſtation which threatens this miſerable Church
wherein we do yet live: And for this purpoſe may it be
thought meet to tie ourſelves by our ſecret and ſilent Vows
to theſe Rules following.</p>
            <p>1. That without all offenſive, tumultuous and ſuſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Gomplottings and Conventions, we ſhall hold up our
private Devotions, and perform theſe our godly underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kings
to that premiſed end.</p>
            <p>2. That there ſhall be no ſuperiority or ſubordination
in this holy <hi>Fraternity,</hi> nor any ſoul more intereſſed in i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
then other; and therefore no Formality or Ceremony of
admittance into it, but a free and voluntary entrance, leſt
open for all comers into this ſtrict courſe of Chriſtian au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity;
without any noiſe, without the required notice of
any, but God and their own Conſcience, that the world
may well ſee and know, that here is no other deſign then
meerly ſpiritual; aiming at nothing but religious tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions
between God and our Souls: and conſiſting in the
performance of the unqueſtionable Exerciſes of Piety and
holy Devotion.</p>
            <p>3. That we ſhall zealouſly excite our Neighbours and
Friends to be paſſionately affected with this ſad Eſtate of
Gods Church, and to be liberal of their ſighs, and tears, and
prayers for the happy recovery of it.</p>
            <p>4. That we will effectually endeavour to work our hearts
to a found Humiliation for our own ſins, which have helpt
to contribute to the common ſtock of our miſeries, and
daily renue our Vows of a more ſtrict and holy obedience,
and a more cloſe walking with our God.</p>
            <p>5. That we ſhall deeply take to heart, and ſecretly mourn
for, and lament the ſins of our people, repreſenting them to
our thoughts in their haynous nature and quality, humbly
begging for their ſerious repentance of them, and earneſtly
deprecating the judgements provoked by them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:98617:18"/>
6. That for this end we ſhall do our beſt indeavour to
get juſt notice of the ſad eſtate of this diſtracted Church of
ours, and to be truly apprehenſive of the peril wherein it
ſtands, as alſo of the horrible Blaſphemies and damnable
Hereſies which have been of late diſgoi ged from the mouth
of Hell amongſt us, and thoſe helliſh practiſes which have
followed thereupon, to the high diſhonour of the Majeſty
of that holy God whom we pretend to ſerve, to the utter
ſhaming of that bleſſed Goſpel which we profeſſe, for as
much as we cannot mourn for what we know not, nor
mourn enough for what we do not know to be ſo tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
ſinful.</p>
            <p>As of the ſins, whereby we have moved the fierce anger
and wrathfull diſpleaſure of our God againſt us, ſo alſo
ſhall we take full notice of the judgements, whereby we
have ſmarted from his moſt juſt hand; yea (in a larger
comprehenſion) of the judgements paſt, preſent, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent;
amongſt which, how can we but ſorrowfully reckon
the mutual effuſion of ſo much Chriſtian blood, ſpilt by
the hands of brethren, (and as the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael</hi> did for
<hi>Benjamin)</hi> bitterly mourn for the ſlain of our people; of
whom ſo many on both parts have been ſwept away from
the earth, in the ſury of a violent hoſtility, as might well
have ſerved to ſtore a populous Nation, or might probably
have over-run the profeſſed enemies of Chriſtendome: To
theſe we cannot but add the woful diſaſters and inexpreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
miſeries which do alwayes inevitably attend an inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
war.</p>
            <p>But of all judgement, none have cauſe to make ſo deep
an impreſſion in us as the ſpiritual; as knowing, that as our
God is terrible in all his inflictions, ſo moſt of all where he
is leaſt-felt; when he payes us in our own coin; when he
puniſheth us with our ſins, making one ſin the revenger and
executioner of another; when he repayes our actual rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
againſt him with a ſenſleſſe obdurateneſſe, with a plauſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſecurity and deadneſſe of ſpirit. When he rewards our
neglect and contempt of his Ordinances, with giving us up
to ſpiritual deluſions, and to the ſeductions of the ſpirits of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98617:18"/>
errour, to prodigious whimſies, and ſpiritual blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
            <p>We ſhall then (as we have too juſt reaſon) lay together
theſe evils that we feel, with thoſe which we have no leſſe
cauſe to fear; and under the ſenſe of both ſhall find our
hearts pierced with ſorrow, and reſolved into the juſt tears
of our mourning.</p>
            <p>8. That we ſhall not fail both by night and day con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
to pour out our hearts in ſtrong eries and fervent
prayer to our God, that he will be pleaſed now at laſt to viſit
this miſerable and diſconſolate Church in mercy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,
and cauſe the light of his Countenance to ſhine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
us once again,</p>
            <p>9. That the matter of our Prayers ſhall be the illumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and reduction of thoſe our weak Brethren, which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend
through ignorance, and out of a well-meant zeal are
in the ſimplicity of their hearts miſcarried into erroneous
wayes, whether of doctrine or practiſe; for the merciful
converſion of the not-obdured and wilful oppoſers of the
Truth; for the ſeaſonable confuſion of the deſperately
malicious enemies of God and his Church; for the ſettling
of the Church of God in righteouſneſſe, order and peace,
for the prevailence and happy ſucceſſe of the Goſpel againſt
all Schiſm, Hereſie, errours in Opinion, and wickedneſſe of
life; for the diſcovery and defeat of all the devices and
machinations of Satan, and all his accurſed Inſtruments,
againſt the Church of Chriſt in all parts of the world, and
eſpecially in theſe disjoynted members of it, wherein we
are intereſſed; for the incouragement and proſperity of
all thoſe that are faithful in the Land, and that are hearty
well-wiſhers to our <hi>Sion;</hi> for the averting of thoſe heavy
and deſolatory judgements which our ſins have thus long
and loud called for; and laſtly, for the making up of our
deplorable breaches, and reuniting of all honeſt and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
hearts in a firm concord and Chriſtian love.</p>
            <p>10. That we ſhall every week ſet apart one day for this
holy purpoſe; wherein we ſhall humble our ſelves in private
faſting and prayer, till it ſhall pleaſe our God to return to
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98617:19"/>
us in his wonted Compaſſion, and to put an end to theſe
deadly diſtractions under which we labour.</p>
            <p>11. That we ſhall willingly abridge our ſelves of our
wonted pleaſure; not giving our ſelves leave to enjoy any
publick meetings of mirth and jollity; nor take the liberty
of thoſe lawful Recreations, which we have formerly made
uſe of, whiles the Hand of God lies thus heavily upon this
Church and Nation.</p>
            <p>12. That it ſhall be the deſire of our hearts, that all
which ſhall condeſcend to joyn together in the profeſſion
of this holy Fraternity, be knit together in an entire affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
to one another, and be ready to ſhow all mutual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
of Chriſtian love and obſervance to each other upon
all occaſions; being withall in all meckneſſe of ſpirit cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritably
affected to, and lovingly converſing with thoſe their
Brethren and Neighbours, which are not yet ſo ſenſible of
the juſt cauſe of their humiliation.</p>
            <p>13. That in the conſcience of our own wants and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities,
we ſhall make it our care to ſpend our main cenſures
upon our ſelves, and our own enormities: Not being apt to
flie out upon the weakneſſes and defects of our Brethren;
bearing with thoſe that are otherwiſe minded in matters of
an inferiour nature, not aggravating the blame of thoſe
their Actions, or Opinions, which may be capable of a
gentler and milder conſtruction; and reſerving the edge of
our zeal for thoſe foul and groſſe offences, which carry
open guilt in their faces, making head againſt them by all
ſpiritual reſiſtence and godly endeavours of Reclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>14. That whenſoever we ſhall be called to deliver the
Meſſage of God to his people in publick Auditiories, we
ſhall not fail to lay open and bewail the ſins of the time,
and to rouze up our Hearers, with all zealous Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
to a lively ſenſe of juſt ſorrow for the univerſal over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowings
of wickedneſſe, and to a vehement and godly ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
againſt the ſtream thereof, by their prayers and utmoſt
endeavours.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:98617:19"/>
15. That we ſhall heartily labour not to be found de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective
in the uſe of all good means, whereby the peace and
welfare of Gods Church may be procured and maintained;
and ſhall carefully avoid all ſuch wayes and meanes, which
may in any ſort endanger the widening of the unhappy
breaches, and multiplying of the many and miſerable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions
thereof.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Laws, to which we have thought fit in theſe
doleful times to bind our ſelves, in the preſence of that
God, who hath graciouſly wrought in us a feeling compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the publique evils; beſeeching him, who is the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of all mercies, to inable us by the powerful operatio
of his good Spirit, to an effectual performance of all theſe
our holy engagements, that after the ſhort time of our
mourning in this vale of tears, we may be admitted to be
the bleſſed partakers of that eternal joy which abides for
all his in Heaven.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian Brethren, of what quality ſoever; I cannot
fear, leſt it will ſeem too much boldneſſe in me to invite you
all to take part with me in this holy Fraternity; which
you ſhall highly wrong if you look upon it as mine, or any
meerly humane inſtitution: No, the Founder of it is in
Heaven; it is the charge of the Holy Ghoſt himſelf, by the
hand of his choſen Veſſel, <hi>Weep with them that weep:</hi> If our
tears therefore be (as they are) moſt juſt, ye are bound to
add yours to them, and ſhall offend if ye forbear: Neither
can you be ignorant that the Son of God himſelf whiles
he was viſibly here upon Earth, did not only own it as well-pleaſing
to him, but encouraged it with the promiſe of an
aſſured comfort, and crowned it with no leſſe title then
Bleſſedneſſe: And if ye look for a more ancient precedent,
even before the Lord of Life was manifeſted in the fleſh, ye
do apparently find this Fraternity of ſingular note in old
<hi>Jeruſalem, Ye know the Man cloathed with white Linnen,
which had the Writers Inkhorn by his ſide,</hi> had this charge
from the mouth of the Lord himſelf, <hi>Go through the midſt of
the City, through the midſt of Jeruſalem, and ſet a mark upon
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98617:20"/>
the foreheads of the Men that ſigh, and that cry for all the
abominations that be done in the midſt thereof.</hi> Lo here, a
company of Mourners marked out for Mercy; even whiles
the Sanctuary is contemptuouſly defiled, and all <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> is
in blood.</p>
            <p>Shall I now need any other motive to win you into the
Brotherhood of this ſacred Order?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Know then,</hi> that they which ſow in tears ſhall reap in joy;
and he that goeth ſorth and weepeth, bearing precious ſeed, ſhall
doubtleſſe come again with rejoycing, bringing his ſheaves with
him.</p>
            <p>Know that they are not Tears, but Pearles, that thus fall
from your Eyes, dearly precious to the Almighty, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
reſerved in his Casket, for the decking of your Souls
to all Eternity.</p>
            <p>Know that even the Lord of Glory was a man of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows,
and that he bedewed <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> with his Teares, ere he
watered is with his Blood. If therefore ye will be moved
either with the ſweet and unfailable promiſes of a gracious
acceptation, and a bleſſed remuneration of everlaſting
comfort, or led by the Precept, or the Example of that
dear Saviour, whoſe Name ye profeſſe to bear, refuſe
not, delay not to enter your ſelves into this ſo holy, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient,
and highly priviledged Fraternity of Mourners in
<hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mourn then, my Brethren, mourn heartily, but (as
the Apoſtle in another caſe) <hi>Mourn not as men without hope,</hi>
Be not diſheartened, O ye faithful Mourners in <hi>Sion,</hi> as
if ye were hopeleſly condemned to a perpetual darkneſſe,
and were doomed to dwell under a Cloud of endleſſe ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
The Almighty will find a time to have mercy upon
his poor Church, and to clear up his countenance towards
his choſen Ones; wiping all tears from their eyes, and all
ſpots from their faces, and anſwering the holy deſires of
their hearts, in ſhewing them his <hi>Sion</hi> in her perfect beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.
Could we but weep ſoundly, he would ſmile upon us,
and comfortably ſhine upon his Sanctuary, and make the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:98617:20"/>
place of his feet glorious, even an eternal excellency, the
joy of many Generations: Indeed for the preſent, O our
God, thou haſt removed our Souls far from peace; thou
haſt moſt juſtly filled us with thine indignation; for we
have deſerved that thou ſhouldſt pour out iniquities upon
us, and ſhouldſt bring upon us the fruits of our own
thoughts, and meaſure our works into our boſomes; and
cauſe us to drink at thy Hand the Cup of thy fury, yea,
even to have the dregs of the Cup of trembling to be
wrung out to us, for we have walked every one after the
imagination of his own evil heart; our tranſgreſſions
are with us, and are multiplied before thee; and though
we have profeſſed to be humbled under thy mighty hand,
we have not cried to thee in our hearts, when we howled
upon our beds; neither have we loathed our ſelves in our
own ſight for the evils that we have committed; ſo as
we do now juſtly lie down in our ſhame, and our confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
covereth us, willingly acknowledging that our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities
have moſt deſervedly turned away thy bleſſings from
us, and drawn thy judgements upon our heads.</p>
            <p>But, O Lord, haſt thou ſo ſmitten us, that there is no
healing for us? Have we put our ſelves utterly out of the
reach of thy boundleſſe mercies? Art not thou the God
that retaineſt not thine anger for ever, becauſe thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteſt
in mercy? Oh why ſhouldeſt thou then be to us as
a mighty Man that cannot ſave? O thou the hope of
<hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Saviour thereof in time of trouble, return,
return to thy people in the tender bowels of thine infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
pitty and compaſſion; humble our Soules throughly
under the ſenſe of our many back ſlidings and grievous
provocations of the Eyes of thy Glory: Oh ſtrike thou
our heart with an unfeigned repentance of all our evil
wayes, and once again ſpeak peace unto thy ſervants:
Was there ever a more ſtiffe-necked and rebellious peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
O Lord, then thine <hi>Iſrael?</hi> more eminent in abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
mercies? more notorious in all kinds of abominable
wickedneſſes? more exerciſed with variety of judgements?
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98617:21"/>
Yet when they cryed to thee in their diſtreſſe thou were
ſtill ready to hear, and deliver them, and to renew thy
ſo often forſeited bleſſings upon them, and wouldſt not
let looſe thy vengeance upon them till there was no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.
Behold, we are thy people, though a ſinful one;
a ſecond <hi>Iſrael</hi> both for ſins and mercies: Now, Lord,
ſince it is thy marvellous mercy that we are not yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,
be ſtill pleaſed to magnifie thy infinite goodneſſe
in thy gracious forbearances and our powerful conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
to thee: And though we cannot but confeſſe that we
are a ſinful Nation, a people laden with iniquity, a ſeed
of evil doers, yet, Lord, thou knoweſt that thou haſt thy
ſecret ones amongſt us; a people that prayeth, and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth
at thy judgements, and waiteth humbly at the
door-poſts of thy Sanctuary; a people that defireth to
walk cloſe with thee their God, and to be approved of
thee in all their wayes; a people that figheth and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
for the abominable ſins of the Land of their Nativity;
Oh, for their ſakes, be thou intreated to hold off thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venging
hand from this ſinful Nation, and even yet ſtill
provoke us by thy goodneſſe to Repentance, O thou the
righteous and merciful Judge of the world, <hi>who even for
ten righteous perſons wouldeſt have ſpared a</hi> Sodome <hi>and</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrah
<hi>from their fiery execution;</hi> be pleaſed tenderly to
regard the cries of thy many hundred faithful and devout
Soules, that ſue to thee for the ſtay and removal of thy
deſerved judgements: Oh do thou look down from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,
and behold from the habitations of thy holineſſe
and thy glory, the unſaigned humiliation of thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
who are proſtrate before thee with faſting and
weeping, and mourning; turn away thine heavy diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
from us, and pitty thy. Sanctuary which is deſolate;
ſo ſhall our mouthes be full of the praiſes of thy Name,
and thy Saints ſhall rejoyce and ſing new Songs unto the
God of our Salvation.</p>
            <p>In the mean time we ſhall in ſilence and hope wait upon
the Lord, that hideth his face from <hi>Jacob,</hi> and not <hi>ceaſe</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:98617:21"/>
to pour out our ſelves in Tears and Supplications to him
that is mighty to ſave; neither will we ſuffer our cheeks
to be dry, or our ſouls to receive comfort, till we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
a gracious anſwer from Heaven, and ſhall ſee that the
Lord hath been pleaſed to ſhew mercy to his <hi>Sion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this condition, we that are <hi>Sions</hi> Mourners ſhall not
need to be diſtinguiſhed (as other Orders are wont) by
Colours, Deviſes, Abiliments. Our qualifications will
be eaſily diſcerned by our ſad faces, wet eyes, deep ſighs,
mortified carriage, willing neglect of thoſe vanities where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with
others are tranſported, our holy retiredneſſe, aſſidu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Devotions, and ſtrict profeſſions of Godlineſſe, Carry
your ſelves thus, dear Brethren, and God and his Angels
ſhall gladly welcome you into that holy Society of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
which ſhall be marked out for preſervation here, and for
eternal comfort hereafter.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, let none of you diſcourage himſelf from entring
into this ſacred Fraternity, out of the ſenſe of his bodily
infirmity, or the urgent neceſſity of outward impediments.
There is many an holy Soul that dwells inconveniently,
in a crazy, tottering, ruinous Cottage, ready to drop
down daily upon his head, not able to endure the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction
of one Meales ſupport: There are not a few well-affected
Chriſtians, whom the neceſſary exigences at their
Calling and Eſtate, like ſo many hard Taskmaſters hold
cloſe to their tale of Bricks, not allowing them the leiſure
of our limited Devotion. Let all theſe of both kinds
know, that they have no cauſe hereupon, either to hold off,
or to think they ſhall (in this caſe) need the diſpenſation
of any ſuperiour power; ſince their condition doth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently
diſpenſe with it ſelf. Even the ſevereſt Caſuiſts of
the <hi>Roman Church</hi> (who are wont to be the rigideſt Exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors
of the outward exerciſes of Mortification) do, in
theſe Caſes, allow of a juſt relaxation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:98617:22"/>
My Brethren; if ye cannot faſt, yet ye can pray, if your
Stomacks be weak, yet your zeal may be ſtrong; ye can
mourn though ye pine not; and if ye cannot ſpare a day
in ſeven, yet ye may ſpare an hour in twelve, and make up
the reſt in your frequent and ſervent Ejaculations: ſhortly
if you have truly mourning Souls they will be accepted in
the neceſſary want of the ſtrict termes of bodily exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes.</p>
