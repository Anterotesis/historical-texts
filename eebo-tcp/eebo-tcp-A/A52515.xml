            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Conſidered in a Letter to a Friend.</head>
            <p>AS for <hi>Noſtradamus</hi>'s Predictions, I am ſatisfied from a thorough-examination of the Principles of Aſtrology, that it is a very vain thing to build any thing upon that Art: But there are ſome of his Rhapſodies that are confined to ſuch individuating circumſtances, as I would fain hear your thoughts, about them. He has not mentioned <hi>England</hi> much above 20 times, in his many thouſand Verſes; and yet here are near half that number of Predictions which have been fulfilled in our Age, to the greateſt
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100883:2"/>
exactneſs, tho they ſeem uncapable of being fulfilled above once, by the confining Characters of them. I will endeavour to render them more <hi>literally</hi> from the <hi>French,</hi> than others have done, that there may be no cavil about the ſenſe of the words.</p>
            <p>The Death of <hi>Charles</hi> I. is determined by theſe peculiar circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, never known before in the world; <hi>viz.</hi> The Death of a King of <hi>England</hi> by a Court of Juſtice; and that alſo by the Parliament; and this alſo after a time of Civil War in the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> as that of <hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Flanders</hi> was, which ended at the Peace of <hi>Munſter,</hi> 1647. It is alſo made to be ſucceeded by the Parliamentary Government, which no other King of <hi>England</hi>'s Death or Deprivation had after it; and the <hi>French</hi> Alliance with the Uſurpers is alſo added to it, juſt as the Royal Family was baniſhed out of <hi>France.</hi>

And it is known, that the great product of that Kingdom for the King's Revenue, for Commerce with other Countreys, as well as for the chief ſupport of its own Inhabitants, is their Wine and Salt; but is more eſpecially its character in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction from other Countreys, which it excels only in theſe two Commodities.</p>

               <p>The plainneſs of the terms in this Prediction, and the particula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizing circumſtances of it fulfilled to exactneſs, does ſtrangely tempt one to be confident, that it could be no gueſs at a venture; and then it does alſo ſhew from the firſt and third Verſes of it, that the ſtile of this Author is both figurative and prophetical, or myſterious.</p>

But when we find it alſo fulfilled in the Age next to <hi>Noſtradamus,</hi> how is it poſſible not to be confident that theſe Verſes can mean no other thing, but that ſingle event only? And in this there is neither figurative nor myſterious expreſſions. The fixing this to the ſame time of the King's Death, with which the Parliamentary Government is joined in the former, does alſo ſhew, that the Protectorian Government muſt be juſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt at the ſame time with that of the Parliament, or force (as it is ſaid) the Parliament to acknowledge it.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Oppoſition</hi> mentioned in the laſt <hi>Quatraine,</hi> does neceſſarily tye it to that before it; and the Confederacy in the firſt <hi>Quatraine</hi> had
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:100883:4"/>
never any thing like it in the world, but the preſent Confederacy againſt the King of <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Turk:</hi> It is a Confederacy from all parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> Eaſt, Weſt, North, and South. And from thence it appears, that by <hi>paſſing Hercules Pillars,</hi> muſt be meant the Latin uſe of that phraſe; that is, To go to the end of the world; which join'd with a great Confederacy, muſt ſignifie in Prophecy a very great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Conqueſt. For, that it is not to go to <hi>America,</hi> appears from the ſcituation of ſome of theſe Countreys. The <hi>King</hi> mentioned in the ſecond <hi>Quatraine,</hi> againſt whom this Confederacy is, muſt be a Romiſh King, who has Monks and Friers in his Kingdom, as the <hi>Chaſt Tribe</hi> or People muſt ſignifie: And then the King muſt be the King of <hi>France:</hi> for there is no other Romiſh Prince excepted out of this Confederacy, but He. <hi>Barcins,</hi> or <hi>Barcelonians,</hi> ſtand for <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi> as <hi>one City</hi> is generally uſed in this Book for the whole People of that Nation. So alſo may <hi>Tuſcans</hi> ſtand for <hi>Italians.</hi> Thus then do we ſee all here tied to this preſent juncture. And then the <hi>raiſing the Exiles</hi> above all, muſt ſignifie the advancement of the exil'd <hi>French</hi> Proteſtants to govern that Kingdom; and the <hi>Chaſt Tribe</hi> ſlain, muſt be the <hi>Monks</hi> and <hi>Friers,</hi> for rebelling againſt the Change: This is well expreſſed, by likening it to the Caſe of <hi>Hippolytus,</hi> who was torn in pieces for refuſing to lie with his Mother-in-law; the true Church being but the Mother-in-law to thoſe people, who will be preſſed to enter into her Boſom and Embraces, but will judge it to be Spiritual Adultery. This agrees well with the 7000 to be ſlain up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Aſcenſion of the Witneſſes</hi> in the 11th chap. <hi>Revelations,</hi> ver. 13. Upon this Reformation of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> is ſaid to <hi>flouriſh a long time in this way;</hi> which intimates, that the Converſion ſhall be laſting.</p>
               <p>From a reflection upon the late Revolution, compared with the other changes of the State of <hi>England</hi> within theſe hundred years, we may obſerve the fulfilling of what follows, contrary to all examples of the neighbouring Countreys round about us.</p>

               <p>This Change of <hi>England</hi> muſt be either <hi>ſeven Conqueſts</hi> of it by Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Nations, or <hi>ſeven Changes</hi> of the Governing Power of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:100883:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it ſelf. <hi>Seven Conqueſts</hi> of Foreign Nations is unconceivable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallell'd for that compaſs of years. It muſt then be ſeven Changes of the Governing-Power of <hi>England. Noſtradamus</hi> wrote this in the time of Q. <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> The firſt Change then was to <hi>Kings;</hi> the next was <hi>the Parliament</hi> after the Death of <hi>Charles</hi> I. Then <hi>Protectors;</hi> then <hi>Kings</hi> again: for the buſtles after the <hi>Protectors</hi> were but a ſtate of Anarchy, and ſtruggles only for the King's return, which began with Sir <hi>George Booth.</hi> And beſides, the whole interval was ſo ſmall, not above one year, and three Scuffles of unſettled Powers only in that time, that none can account them ſettled Governments. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Kings returned</hi> were the fourth Change; and the late change to King and Sovereign Queen is the fifth; and we ſee it neceſſary from thence to have one Change more, and very likely two, before this Generation paſſes away. The <hi>Blood</hi> mentioned with the Changes, may ſignifie only the trampling down all oppoſition againſt it, or the end of the Plotters againſt the Government.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee with how little allowance for Prophecy, or myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious expreſſions, theſe things are verified. But what to aſcribe the Predicting Power to, I leave to your ſelf. <hi>Noſtradamus</hi> pretends to Inſpiration, as well as to Aſtrology; and indeed, as I ſee many lucky hits from Aſtrology, without the leaſt grounds from the force of its Principles: why may there not be the hand of ſome unſeen Spirits in it, either for good ends, or to draw in ſome to a too great truſt in unreaſonable ways? The famous ſtories we have of <hi>Nickson</hi>'s, and other ordinary perſons Predictions, which can very hardly be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of, do ſatisfie us, That men need not be very Wiſe, not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily Holy, to foretel things truly, where they have no grounds or reaſons for it.
