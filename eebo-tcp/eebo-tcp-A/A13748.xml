            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

For lo I gaue to Iohn<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Puruay / a benefice but a myle out of this caſtell / and I herde more complein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis aboute his couetouſneſſe for tythes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d other myſdoyngys than I didde of all men that wer auauncid within my dioceſſe.</p>
               <p>And I ſeid to the Archebiſſhop. Syr pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uay is nother with you now for the benefice y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> ye gaue hym / nor he holdith feithfully with the learnyng that he tawght and writ before tyme and thus he ſhewith hym ſelf nother to be hote nor colde: and therfore he and his felaws may ſore drede that if they torne not haſtely to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> waye that they haue forſakyn: paraue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ture they be put out of the nombre of criſtis choſyn people.</p>
               <p>And the Archebiſſhop ſeid. Though Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uay be now a falſe harlot I quyte me to hym / but come he more for ſoche cauſe before me: or we departe I ſhall knowe with whome he hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith.

               <p>And I ſeid. Syr / Maſter Iohn Wicleff was holden of full many men the greatiſte cler<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ke that they knewe than lyuyng / and therwith he was namid a paſſing ruely man and an ynno<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cent
<pb facs="tcp:5189:16"/>
in his lyuynge and herefore greate men commonyd ofte with hym and they louyd ſo his learnyng that they writ it / and beſily enforſid them to rule themſelf there after. Therfore ſyr this foreſeid learnyng of Maſter Iohn Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleff is yet holden of full many men and wome<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the moſte agreable learning vnto the lyuing a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d teachyng of Criſte and of his Apoſtles / &amp; moſte openly ſhewing and declaring how the chirche of Criſte hathe ben and yet ſhulde be rewlid a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d gouernid. Therfore ſo many men and women couet this learnyng / &amp; purpoſe / thorough god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dis grace to conforme their lyuyng lyke to this learnyng of Wicleff. Maſter Iohn aiſton ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wght and writ accordingly a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d full beſily wher and whan / and to whome that he myght / and he vſid it hymſelf right perfitely vnto his lifes ende. And alſo Philip of Rampenton while he was a chanone of Laceſter / Nicolas Herforde Dauy Gotray of Pakring monke of Bylande and a maſter of diuinite / and Iohn Purnay a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d many other wich wer holden right wiſe men &amp; prudent tawcht and writ beſily this forſeid lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyng and conformid them therto. And with all thes men I was ofte right homely a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyd with them long tyme and ofte: and ſo befo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re all other men I choeſ wilfully to be infour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>myd of them and by them and ſpecially of Wi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cleff hymſelf / as of the moſte verteuous &amp; god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wyſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that I herde of or knewe. And ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of hym ſpecially and of thes men I tooke
<pb facs="tcp:5189:16"/>
the learnyng that I haue tauchte and purpoſe to lyue there after (if god will) to my lyues ende. For though ſome of thes men be contrary to the learnyng that they taucht before I wote well y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> their learning was trewe wich they tauchte: a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d therfore with the helpe of god I purpoſe to hol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de and to vſe the learning wich I harde of the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> / while they ſat on Moyſes chaire / and ſpecially while that they ſat on the chaire of Criſte. But after y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> werkis that they now do I will not doo with goddis helpe. For they feyne and hyde a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>trarie the trewthe wich before they taucht out plenily and trewly. For as I know well when ſome of thes men hathe ben blamyd for their ſclaunderous doyng / they grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>te not that they haue tauchte a miſſe or crryd beforetyme / but y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they were conſtreinyd by peine to leaue to tell out the ſothe / and thus they choeſe now rather to blaſpheme god than to ſuffer awhile here perſecucion bodely for ſothefaſtneſſe that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte ſhed out his harte bloode for.</p>
               <p>And the Archebiſſhop ſeid. That learnyng that thou calliſt trewthe and ſothefaſtneſſe is open ſclaunder to holy chirche / as it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyd of holy chirche. For all be it / that Wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleff your autour was a great clerke &amp; though that many men helde hym a perfite lyuer yet his doctrine is not approuyd of holy cherche but many ſentencis of his learnyng ar da<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyd as they well woorthy ar. But as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Philip of Ra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>peton y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> was firſt chanone
<pb facs="tcp:5189:17"/>
and after Abbot of Laceſter which is now biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Lincoln: I tell the that the daye is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men for wich he faſtyd the euene. For nother he holdeth now / nor will holdethe learnyng that he thaughte whan he was a Chanon of Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. For no biſſhop of this la<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de perſewith now more ſharpely them that holde thy waye than he doeth.</p>
               <p>And I ſeid. Syr full many men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men wonderith vpon hym and ſpeakith hym mekill ſhame and holdith him for a curſid ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mye of the treuthe.</p>
               <p>And the Archebiſſhop ſeid to me. Wherfo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re tarieſte thou me thus here with ſoche fables / wilt thou ſhortely (as I haue ſeid to the) ſubmit the to me or no?</p>
               <p>And I ſeid. Syr I tell you at one worde / I dare not for the drede of god ſubmitt me to you after the tenour and ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce that ye haue aboue reherſed to me.</p>
               <p>And than as if he hadde ben wrothe he ſeid to one of his clerkis.

               <p>Than haſtely the Clerke tooke out / and leid forthe on a cupborde diuerſe rollis and writin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis / among which ther was a litle one / which y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> clerke deliuered to the Archebiſſhop.

               <p>¶The thyrde ſonday after eaſter the yere of ou<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>re lorde .M.CCCC. and ſeuen / William Thor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe came vnto the towne of Shrewiſbury / and thorow leaue graunted vnto him to preache: He ſaid openly in ſeynt Chaddis chirche in his ſermone / that the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t of the altare after the conſecracion was materiall brede. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ymages ſhulde in no wiſe be worſhiped. And that men ſhulde not go on pilgremages. And that prieſtes haue no title to tythes. And that it is not lefull for to ſwere in any wiſe.</p>
               <p>And whan the Archebiſhop had red thus thys rolle / he rolled it vp ageyn / and ſaid to me. Ys this holſome learnynge to be amonge the people?</p>
               <p>And I ſaid to him. Syr I am both aſhamed on their behalfe and right ſoroufull for the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that haue certified you thes thinges thus vntrewly: for I preached neuer nor taughte thus priuely nor apertly.</p>
               <p>And the Archebiſhop ſaid to me. I will gy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue credence to thes worſhipfull men which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue writen to me and witneſſed vnder their ſealis there amonge them. Though thou now denieſt this: weniſt thou y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I will geue credence to the? Thou loſell haſt trobled y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worſhipful cominalte of Shrewiſbury / ſo that the bailives and comi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nalte of that towne haue writen to me praynge me that am Archebiſhop of Caunterbury / pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and Chaunceler of Englond / that I will

vouchſafe to graunte them / that yf thou ſhalt be made (as thou art worthy) to ſuffer open Iou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe for thyne hereſyes / that thou maye haue thi youreſſe openly ther among them: ſo that all they whome thou and ſoche other loſelles haue ther peruerted / may thorow feare of thy dede be reconſyled ageyn to the vnite of holy chyrche. And alſo they that ſtande in true faythe of holy churche may thorowe thy dede be more ſtabliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed therein. And as yf thys aſkyng hadde plea<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſed the Archebiſhop / he ſaid. By my thrifte this hartye prayoure and feruente requeſte ſhall be thought on.</p>
               <p>But certeynly nother the prayer of the men of Shrewiſbery / nor the manaſſynge of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>chebiſhoppe made me any thinge a frayde. But in reherſyng of this malice and in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynge of it my herte greatly reioyſed and yet do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the.

And as hauynge no dreade of the malice of tyrauntes / by truſtynge ſtedfaſtly in the helpe of the lorde with full pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe for to knowlege the ſothefaſtneſſe / and to ſtande thereby after my connyng and power I ſaid to the Archebiſhop. Syr yf the truthe of gods worde might now be accepted as it ſholde be / I doute not to proue by lykely euidence / that they that are famed to be out of the faythe of ho<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ly church in Shrewiſbery &amp; in other places alſo
<pb facs="tcp:5189:18"/>

But naw (I ſaid) in the newe lawe nother Chriſte nor ony of hys apoſtles toke tythes of the people / nor co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>maun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the people to pay tythes nother to prieſtes / nor to deacons.

And therfore the people is full heuy to paye (as they do) their temporall goodes to perſones a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to other vicares and prieſtes / whiche ſholde be feithfull diſpenſatours of the pareſhes goodes taking to themſelfes nomore but a ſcarce lyui<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>g of tythes nor of offrynges by the ordinaunce of the comon lawe. For what ſoeuer prieſtes take of the people: be it tythe or offering or ony other deutie or ſeruyce: the prieſtes ought not to haue thereof nomore but a bare lyuyng / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te the reſidew to the poore men &amp; women ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of the pariſhe / of whome they take this tem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porall lyuynge. But the moſt dele of prieſtes no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>we waſteth their pareſhes goodes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d ſpendeth the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> at their owne will after the worlde in theire veyne luſtes / ſo that in fewe places poore me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue dewly (as they ſholde haue) their owne ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunce / nother of tythes nor of offerynges / nor of other large wages &amp; foundacions y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> prieſtes
<pb facs="tcp:5189:38"/>
take of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> people in diuerſe maners aboue it that they nede for nedefull ſuſtenaunce of meate and clothinge. But y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore nedy people ar forſaken and lefte of prieſtis to be ſuſteinyd of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paroſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis / as if the prieſtis toke nothing of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> paroſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis / for to helpe y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> poore people with. And thus ſyr into ouer greate chargis of the paroſhenis they pay their te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall goods twiſe / wher ones myght ſuffice / if prieſtis wer trew diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tours. Alſo ſir the paroſhenis that pay their te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>porall goodes (be they tythes or offeringes) to prieſtis that doo not their office among them iuſtely / ar parteners of euery ſynne of thoſe prie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtis: becauſe that they ſuſteyne thoſe prieſtis fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their ſynne with their te<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>porall goods. Yf thes thinges be well conſiderid what wonder is it than ſir / if the paroſhenis grudge ageinſt thes diſpenſatours?</p>
               <p>Than the Archebiſſhop ſaid to me. Thou y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſholdeiſt be iudged and reulyd by holy chirche / preſumptuouſly thou demeſt holy chirche to ha<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ue erryd in the ordinaunce of tyhes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wties to be payd to priſtis. Yt ſhall be long or thou thryue Loſell / that thou deſpiceſt thy go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtely mother. How dariſt thou ſpeake this Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell among the people? Ar not tythes geuyn to prieſtis for to lyue by?</p>
               <p>And I ſaid. Sir ſeynt Paul ſaith that tythes wer gyuen in the olde lawe toleuytes a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d to prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtis / that came of the lynage of Leui / But our prieſt he ſaith came not of the lynage of Leui /

And therfore Paul ſaith / ſyns the prieſthode is chau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged fro the generacion of Leui to the generacion of Iuda / it is neceſſarie y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> chaungyng alſo be ma<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>de of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lawe. So y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> prieſtis lyue now without tythes and other dewties y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> they now claime / fo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lowing Chriſte and his apoſtles in wilfull po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerte / as they haue gyuen them example. For ſyns Chriſte lyued all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> tyme of his preaching by pure almoſe of the people / and by example of hym his apoſtles lyued in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſame wyſe / or els by the trauell of their ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dis / as it is ſaid aboue Euery prieſte whoſe prieſthode Chriſte appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyth knowith well / and confeſſith in worde / &amp; in werke that a diſciple owith not to be aboue his maſter / but it ſufficeth to a diſciple to be as his maſter / ſymple / and pure / meke and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient: &amp; by exa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ple ſpecially of his maſter Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte / euery prieſte ſholde reule hym in all his ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uyng / and ſo after his connyng &amp; power a prie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte ſholde beſy hym to enfourme &amp; to reule who<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>me ſo euer he myght charitably.</p>
               <p>And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to me with a gre<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>at ſpirite Goddis curſe haue thou and myne for this teaching: for thou woldiſt hereby make y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> olde law more fre a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d perfite than the new law. For thou ſaiſt that it is lefull to leuites and to prieſtis to take tythes in the olde lawe / and ſo to enioye their priuelegies: but to vs prieſtis in the new lawe thou ſaiſt it is not lefull to take tyhes.
<pb facs="tcp:5189:39"/>
And thus thou geuiſt leuytes of the olde lawe more fredome than to prieſtis of the new lawe</p>
               <p>And I ſaid. Sir I meruell / that ye vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtonde this playne texte of Paul thus. Ye wote well / that the leuites and prieſtes in the olde la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we that toke tythes wer not ſo fre nor ſo perfite as Chriſte and his apoſtles that tooke no tythes And ſir there is a doctour (I thinke y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> it is ſeynt Ierome) that ſaith thus. The prieſtis that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge now in the new lawe tythes / ſay in effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te / that Chriſte is not becomen man / nor that he hath yet ſuffered dethe for mannis loue. Wher<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fore this doctour ſaith thys ſentence. Syns ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes wer the hyres and wagis limyted to leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes and to prieſtes of the olde lawe for bearing about of the tabernacle / and for fleayng and fle<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ayng of beaſtis / and for burning of ſacrifice / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d for keping of the temple / and for tromping of battell before the oſte of Iſrael / and other diuer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſe obſeruauncis that perteinyd to their office: thoſe prieſtis that will chalenge or take tythes: denye that Chriſte is comen in fleſſhe and doo y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> prieſtis office of the olde lawe for whome tythes wer grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted: for els (as this doctour ſaith) prie<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtis take now tythes wrongfully.</p>
               <p>And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to his clerkes. Herde ye euer loſell ſpeake thus? Certeyn this is the learnyng of them all / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> wher ſo euer they come / and they may be ſuffered / they enforce
<pb facs="tcp:5189:40"/>
them to expugne the fredome of holy chirche.</p>
               <p>And I ſaid. Sir why call you the takyng of tythes and of ſoche other dewties that prieſtes chalenge now wrongfully the fredome of holy chirche: Syns nother Chriſte nor his apoſtles chalengid nor tooke ſoche dewties. Herefore thes takyngis of prieſtis now ar not callyd iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtely the fredome of holy chirche / but all ſoche geuyng and takyng ought to be called and hol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>den the ſclaunderous couetouſneſſe of men of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> holy chirche.</p>
               <p>And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to me.

               <p>And I ſaid.

               <p>And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to me. Thou iud<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>geſt euery prieſte proude y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> will not go arayed as thou doſte.

               <p>And I ſaid.

               <p>And the Archebiſſhop ſaid to me.

               <p>And I ſaid. Sir I truſte not hereto. But to our firſte purpoſe / ſir I tell you y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> I was onys in a gentill mannis houſe / and there war than two clerkes there.

ſwearing by it / a<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d kyſſing it / promiſyng in this fourme to doo this thyng or that / will ſay &amp; wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe that he that towcheth thus a booke and kyſſeth it hath ſworne vpon that booke: and all other men that ſee that man thus doo / and alſo all tho that heare hereof in the ſame wyſe wyll ſaye and witneſſe / that thys man hathe ſwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne vpon a boke / wherfore the maſter of diuinite ſayde. Yt was not lefull nother to gyue nor to take ony ſoche charge vpon a boke / for euery boke is nothing els but diuerſe creatures of whi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>che it is made of. Therfore to ſwere vpon a boke is to ſweare by creatures / and this ſwearinge is euer vnlefull. This ſentence witneſſeth Chri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſoſtome playnly blaming them greatly that brin<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ge forthe a boke for to ſweare vpon / charginge clerkes that in no wiſe they conſtrayne ony body to ſweare / whether they thinke a man to ſweare true or falſe.</p>
               <p>And the Archebiſhop and his clerkes ſcorned me &amp; blamyd me greatle for this ſaiyng. And y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Archebiſhop manaſſed me with great puniſſhe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment and ſharpe / except I lefte this opinion of ſwearinge.</p>

               <p>Than the Archebiſhope badde a clercke rede this homely of Chriſoſtome which homely thys clerke helde in his hande writen in a roll / which

Alſo full many men and women ſay nowe / that it is well done to ſweare by creatures / wha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> they maye not (as they ſaye) otherwiſe be beleued.

               <p>And the archebiſhop ſaid / that Chriſoſtome might be thus vnderſtonde.</p>

               <p>And I ſaid.

               <p>And the clerke ſaide. I fonded / and that I ſayde not trewthe.</p>
               <p>And I aſked this clerke whether it wer more to reade the goſpell or to touche y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpell.</p>
               <p>And he ſaid / it was more to reade y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpell.</p>
               <p>Than I ſaid. Sir by authorite of ſeynt Iero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me the goſpell is not the goſpell for reding of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> letter / but for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> beleue that men haue in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worde of god / that it is the goſpell that we beleue / and not the letter y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> we rede: for becauſe the letter y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is touched with mannes hande is not the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
/ but y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſentence that is verely beleued in ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nis hart is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> goſpell. For ſo ſeynt Ierome ſaith The goſpell that is the vertue of goddes wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de is not in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> leauys of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> boke / but it is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> roo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te of reaſon. Nother the goſpell (he ſaith) is in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> writing aboue of the letters / but the goſpell is in the marking of y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> ſentence of ſcriptures. This ſentence approueth ſeynt Paule ſaiynge thus. The kyngdome of god is not in worde but in vertue. And Dauid ſaith. The voice of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lorde that is his worde is in vertue. And after dauid ſaith. Thorow the worde of god / y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> heuens were fourmed / &amp; in the ſpirite of his mouth is all the vertue of them. And I pray you ſyr / vnderſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de ye well how Dauid ſaith / that in y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> ſpirite of the mouth of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> lorde is all the vertue of angells and of men?</p>

               <p>And I ſayde. Syr though men vſe to ſaye thus / yet it is vnperfyte ſpeche. For the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall parte off a thinge is properlye the hooll thynge· For lo / mannes ſoule that may not now be ſene here / nor touched with ony ſenſible thing is properly man. And all the vertue of a tree is in the roote thereof that maye not be ſene / for do awaye the roote / and the tree is deſtroyed. And ſyr as ye ſayde to me right nowe / god and hys worde are of one authorite / and ſyr ſeynte Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome witneſſeth that Chriſte very god and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man is hidde in the letter of his lawe: thus alſo ſyr the goſpell is hidde in the letter. For ſir as it is full likely many diuerſe men and wo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>men here in the erthe touched Chriſte and ſawe hym and knewe his bodely perſone whiche no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther touched nor ſawe nor knewe goſtely his god hede: right thus ſir many men now touche and ſee / and write and rede the ſcriptures of goddis lawe / whiche nother touche / ſee nor rede effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuallye the goſpell. For as the godhede of Chriſte that is the vertue of god is knowen by the vertue thorow belefe / ſo is the goſpell / y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> is Chriſtes worde.</p>
               <p>And a clerke ſaid to me. Thes be full my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie maters and vnſauery that thou ſheweſt he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re to vs.</p>

               <p>And than a clercke (as I geſſe) Malueren ſayde to me. Thou knoweſt not thyne equiuo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacyons / for the kyngdome of heuene hathe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſe vnderſtondinges. What calleſt thou the kingdome of heuene in this ſentence that thou ſheweſt here?</p>
               <p>And I ſaid. Sir by good reaſon &amp; ſentence of doctours y<hi rend="sup">•</hi> realme of heuene is called here y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> vnderſtonding of gods worde.</p>
               <p>And a clerke ſaid to me. Frome who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> thinkeſt thou that this vnderſtondinge is taken awaye?</p>
               <p>And I ſaid.

               <p>Tha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the Archebiſhop ſaid. Well / well / thou wilt iudge thy ſouereyns. By god the kyng do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not his deutie / but he ſuffer the to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dempned.</p>
               <p>And than a nother clerke ſaid to me. Why on friday that laſt was / counſeldeſt thou a man off my lordes / that he ſholde not ſhriue him to man but onely to god?</p>
