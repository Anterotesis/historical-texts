         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WHereas your Grace imployed <hi>Ignatius Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-water,</hi> to move our holynesse for some consolation in these your miseries, in regard that no petition or request of yours, nor any such loyall subject to us, as your Grace has bin, should suffer repulse; know that we out of our holy cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, have first granted a particular pardon to your Grace, for all offences and sins, of what na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture soever heretofore committed, or hereafter to bee committed, <hi>Gratis.</hi> But withall know it is not usuall for us to remit sins, (the nature whereof we are ignorant) under the value of 50000. markes starling at least. But your Grace having so well improved your time (for you had almost reduc't great part of the Iland) to be conformable to our holy rites, Ceremonies, and customes, (which the ignorant call superstitious, and committing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:93277:3"/>
Adulteries with the whore of <hi>Babylon</hi>) we being holily affected, and studious to reward vertue, not only have granted your owne pardon <hi>gratis,</hi> but are desirous that your Grace would publish our free and easie remissions to all your friends that are well affected to our Holinesse.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If any Priest have stole any holy or conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated things out of any holy place, (to show that we are mercifull to your friends) we tax him at seven grosses, which in your English coine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to ten shillings six pence, what though the value of the thing stole amounted to 20. <hi>li.</hi> it may be his gown was as bare as the bowling-al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley on his head, and though he tooke a course that was not very commendable, yet necessary, for your sake at the said rate, for tis very fit his sin should not be committed without money, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his pardon and our love.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Next if a man commit adultery with a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Church, as many a man through heat of blood may doe, especially having such objects to behold, as would thaw the icie blood of a holy Priest in the holy time of <hi>Lent,</hi> he for his absolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall pay but six grosses, that's nine shillings.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If a Priest buy a Benefice, as we see no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son why he should not, it being for his profit, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother poore man gaping for it, charity begins at home, eight grosses that's twelve shillings.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He that has kil'd his father, mother, wife, si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, or any other kinsman, or kinswoman, or all
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:93277:3"/>
of them, so they be of the laity is rated at five grosses, or seven grosses, and the reason why he is rated so low, all or any of these may be done up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on good grounds, as his father might be old and hard-hearted, one that would neither die nor al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him meanes, his mother in possibility to be a witch, had not his provident hand prevented it, his wife incontinent might give him the Hornes, and make his head the wonder of the world, his sister one of St. <hi>Antholins</hi> society, his kinsman and kinswoman pinpe and bawd, he rather de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serves to be rewarded.</p>
            <p n="5">5. A man that beats his wife with child, and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or both of them die, though his intentions might be good, he would not it may be be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thensome to the parish, or to save his owne char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, or it may be the breed was not good, so that he kil'd both mother and infant, or it may be he had a greater mind to another woman, yet he shall pay five grosses, seven shillings six pence for his absolution.</p>
            <p n="6">6. If any of the sacred order of Priest-hood, keepe a Concubine, he is rated at seven grosses, that's something with the most, considering they are men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they eate as good meates of mortality as others. They shrive, swive young and handsome Maids, they are allowed no wives to spend their Talent upon; therefore they must needs have a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle <hi>Coitum,</hi> for Physitians say it is wholesome and good, <hi>ad renes purgando,</hi> yet we must not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:93277:4"/>
winke at him without the said summe.</p>
            <p n="7">7. If a Priest defile a Virgin, he shall pay for his absolution six grosses, nine shillings, and no more. For we taking into our serious consideration, what a woman was made for, and what she was made handsome for; and conceiving it most fit that she should be broken up in religion, that she might afterwards trade with a more safe Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence thinke him not worthy a deeper censure.</p>
            <p n="8">8. An absolution for him that lies with his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother, or with any woman of his bloud or carnal kindred, or for him that lies with his sister or his own mother, is taxed at five grosses, seven shillings. For though a man by the rules of nature ought to requite curtesies, and for that reason did <hi>carnali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um coire cum</hi> his Godmother, and though it may be he was bashfull, and ashamed to disclose his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions to a stranger, and therefore out of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>destie made bold with his sister, and though it may be his father was an old man and not able to satisfie his mothers libidinous appetite, and some body must needs doe it, and he could not endure that any should Cuckold his father but himselfe, or it may be his mother was a widdow and would marry againe, unlesse shee might have some sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in her case, and if she married, it might be prejudiciall to his estate, and therefore hee would play the part of a Stallion, yet we cannot tax him at lesse then five grosses.</p>
            <p n="9">9. If a man have vowed to build an Hospitall,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:93277:4"/>
to found a Chappell, or erect a Church parochi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all, and hath afterwards seriously considered what inconveniences may thereby ensue, as a bad use might be made of his good intentions, and so in times to come, vice rather then religion may be nurtured in them, and the many sums of mony, it would cost him to no purpose; and therefore have a desire to have a dispensation from his vow, it shall cost him ten grosses.</p>
            <p n="10">10. If any man have a wife, that he's desirous to part withall (for reasons to himselfe best knowne) and in her place would marry and live with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and have his children made <hi>Legitimate,</hi> all this shall be done for ten grosses that's 15. shillings.</p>
            <p>Our holinesse would have been pleased, to have perticularized more offences, &amp; the penalties for them, but we were informed by your Messenger <hi>Ignatius Holy-water,</hi> that time was very precious to you, &amp; if he made not hast you were in <hi>Posse,</hi> to be sent to <hi>Lim bum Patrum,</hi> without our holynes par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, (which <hi>Mary</hi> defend) which is the only cause that makes our holines to be so briefe, but at the next returne of this our holy messenger, we will vouchsafe to nominate the penalties of the rest of the pardonable offences. In the <hi>Interim,</hi> let not your Grace be too remisse to see these sums tolle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and transported to our holynesse use.</p>
