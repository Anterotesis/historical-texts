            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>AS Cowards would the Name of Cowards ſhun,</l>
               <l>With Blustring Words, all ſaid, and nothing done,</l>
               <l>So Bully Poet I have known to ſcape</l>
               <l>Such a hard Cenſure, would a Hero Ape,</l>
               <l>And Paint <hi>Almanzor</hi> in a Monſters Shape.</l>
               <l>Our Poet too, by ſuch a Trick drawn in,</l>
               <l>Too late repents the Self-deceiving ſin:</l>
               <l>For he forſooth,</l>
               <l>In this ripe Age, where every Man's a Wit:</l>
               <l>Leſt he ſhould be the only Blot was hit,</l>
               <l>To ſave his Credit, as he thought, has writ,</l>
               <l>Suppoſing that malicious Men might ſay,</l>
               <l>Pox on't, he's Dull—he Dull—and writ a Play;</l>
               <l>Why, I writ one, you know, but t'other day.</l>
               <l>But, ſince the Folly did ſo far deceive him,</l>
               <l>Faith, he's aſham'd to ask you to forgive him:</l>
               <l>For here he ſwears, if you look out for Wit,</l>
               <l>You may as reaſonably expect to meet</l>
               <l>Wit or good Manners in a dull Lampoon,</l>
               <l>Or Chriſtian Quarter from a <hi>French</hi> Dragoon.</l>
               <l>Humility in Prelates, Truth in Prieſts,</l>
               <l>Or in an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Coffee-houſe good Jeſts.</l>
               <l>(Where, with our fancy'd Ruins, they make merry,</l>
               <l>And from Mouths charg'd with ſmoak, Bomb <hi>London-Derry.)</hi>
               </l>
               <l>No, Faith, our Author Imitates <hi>Ragoo,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>For as without a ſhirt he was a Beau;</l>
               <l>So without Wit he ſets up for a Poet,</l>
               <l>And thinks himſelf no more oblig'd to ſhow it.</l>
               <l>For if like <hi>Bays,</hi> all Poets ſhould take pains</l>
               <l>In letting Blood, and Phyſicking their Brains,</l>
               <l>The Doctors Bill would ſweep the third days gains.</l>
               <l>Sure then, 'twas more Judicious <hi>Bays</hi> deſign'd,</l>
               <l>Than Purging of his Body; ay, 'twas his mind,</l>
               <l>To temper it to bear with every Wind.</l>
               <l>Thus to the change of Times, he changes Rhimes,</l>
               <l>Whilſt to the face of things his fancy Chimes,</l>
               <l>And moulds his Soul and Body with the Times.</l>

But as I was ſaying, I bred him at School, and it was a forward dirty Boy; from thence I ſent him to the Univerſity; from the Univerſity to the Inns of Court, where in two years time, from a ſober, grave, diſcreet youth, he grew the Debauch of the Town; roaring, drinking, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, fighting, were his daily Diverſions: and becauſe I wou'd not ſupply the Rogue with Moneys to maintain his Villanies, he comes down with a formal Recantation to me in the Country, where like a Rogue, a Cut-throat Thief in the Night, he robb'd me of five hundred pounds, and now he ſends me word, he'll make ſuch an other Viſit.</p>
