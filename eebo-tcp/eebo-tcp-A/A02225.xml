            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

was it, ere ſhe came to the height of her glory; but here was her miſery, her ſinne grew vp as faſt as her ſelfe; ſhe was no elder in age, then in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill: and therefore, the longer ſhee had ſetled, with <hi>Moab,</hi> on the lecs of wickedneſſe, the more need to be powred out from veſſell to veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell; the longer the blade of her iniquitie had beene growing, the riper, and the readier to bee cut downe with the ſickle of vengeance.

            <p>Tis not (I hope) expected, that I ſhould here apply this point: tis a Prophecie, and I am nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Prophet, nor Prophets ſonne, therefore all I ſay vnto you, is what <hi>Daniel</hi> ſaid vnto <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar, The dreame be to them that hate you, and the interpretation thereof to your enemies.</hi> But if (of your ſelues) you would meditate on <hi>Tyres iudgement,</hi> and that ſeriouſly; if in her ruine, you would but ſeeme to read your owne, that <hi>by others harmes</hi> you might <hi>learne to beware,</hi> twould be the happieſt application of a <hi>Text,</hi> that euer was made.

Tyre</hi> was fairely warn'd, when the Lord ſent his Prophets vnto her, riſing vp earely, and ſending them, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding line vnto line, precept vnto precept, heere a little, and there a little; in this ſee we <hi>God</hi> as a kind Father ſhewing mercy; but <hi>Tyre</hi> would not take that warning, forcing him to decree, &amp; to purpoſe that <hi>Her owne feet ſhould carry her a far off to ſoiourne.</hi> In this wee ſee the ſame <hi>God</hi> as a iuſt Iudge, executing Iuſtice; there is <hi>mercy</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in the one of his Acts, but there cannot be <hi>cruelty</hi> in the other. It belongs to the Iudge of heauen and earth to doe right; therefore tis
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:18890:17"/>
no more proper to him to ſhew compaſſion, then tis vpon (iuſt occaſion) to inflict puniſhment.</p>
            <p>Well then, if the Lord bee hee that puniſheth, beware, yee Sonnes of men, of offending, and beware in two reſpects.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in regard he is <hi>Omniſcient,</hi> can ſo eaſily find out what euer euill you doe: And ſecondly, in regard he is <hi>Omnipotent,</hi> can ſo eaſily punniſh, when he hath found out euill done. As for the former, truſt him, thou Adulterer if thou dare, get thee forth in the twilight, and in the black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the night commit thy deedes of darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, hope to walke in a cloude, and ſay in thy heart, tuſh, the Lord ſees it not. But marke, whether he doe not, one day, reproue thee, and ſet before thee the things that thou haſt done; aſſure thy ſelfe he ſees thy works, heareth thy words, vnderſtands thy thoughts long before; he is about thy pathes, and about thy bed, and ſpieth out all thy wayes: That which thou doſt in ſecret hee ſees openly, and what thou plotteſt, and contriueſt on thy bed by night, in the darke Cloſet and Cabinet of thy heart, is to him as cleare as the Sunne at nooue day, and as it were, apparently ſet vpon the Houſe top, the eye of heauen that neuer ſlumbreth nor ſlee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, is ſtill waking, and waiting, and watching ouer thee, and when thou thinkeſt it cloſed vp and faſt, at moſt it doth but winke.</p>
            <p>And as the Lords eye is thus piercing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery thy wickedneſſe, ſo is his hand powerfull to take vengeance on thee for it, therefore in the ſecond place, beware, <hi>It is a fearefull thing to

            <p>Now if ſuch be the danger of <hi>Pride,</hi> and if it ſo moue <hi>God</hi> to inflict puniſhment on it, how dareth it ſo frequently iett vp and downe the ſtreets, and not feare the heauy hand of heauen? How commeth it to paſſe there are ſuch troopes of Gallants, euery where met, ſo printed, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, perfum'd, ſo kemm'd and trimm'd that a haire may not ſtand awry?

ancient Tenants children a begging, and yet keepe no houſe to relieue them with a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of bread?

            <p>Againe, if great be the danger of <hi>pride,</hi> and if it ſeeme chiefely to moue God to inflict puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, how commeth it that our women build ſuch turrets and caſtles on their heads, with brai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded haire and gold put about?
